The rules assert that competition is responsible for determining the patterns of assemblage composition. Diamond's paper sparked nearly two decades worth of controversy in the literature, from the late seventies through the late nineties and is considered a turning point in community ecology. The disagreement continues to this day.\n\nThe first rule is \"forbidden species combinations\". Diamond's hypothesis was that competition, not random immigration, was the main force structuring the species composition of islands.\n\nSo for example, the Bismarck black myzomela (\"Myzomela pammelaena\") excludes the black sunbird (\"Nectarinia sericea\"). The Bismarck black myzomela lives on 23 of the 41 surveyed islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, but not on any of the 14 islands inhabited by the black sunbird. The two birds are about the same size, and both use their curved bills to sip nectar; Diamond argued that competition affects their distribution.\n\nCase tested the assembly rule that species occurring together on islands should have less niche overlap than random assemblages because they have undergone specialization. His study measured niche overlap of lizards on 37 islands near Baja California and compared niche overlap to the median niche overlap of computer generated random species assemblages. Case found that 30 of the 37 islands had lower niche overlap than the random assemblages and that some of the competition is due to interspecific competition.\n\nTesting the assembly rules is a complex process that often uses computer simulations to compare experimental data with characteristics of random assemblages of species. The rules are generally regarded as hypotheses that need to be tested on an individual basis, not as accepted conclusions.\n\nAs a reaction to the assembly rules controversy, ecologist Stephen Hubbell proposed that the abundance and diversity of species in a community is determined mainly by random dispersal, speciation, and extinction. This came to be known as the unified neutral theory of biodiversity.\n\n"}

It came into widespread use around 2013 and 2014 through social media and hip-hop and R&B lyrics. It usually refers to a person's romantic partner, especially a boyfriend or girlfriend, but has also been used as a general term of affection for things, including inanimate objects.\n\nThe term originated as an abbreviation of the word \"baby\" or \"babe\". It has been suggested that the term originated as an acronym for \"before anyone else\", but this is unlikely and this false etymology is probably an example of a backronym.\n\nSeveral Internet memes have caused the widespread adoption of the term. \"Bae caught me slippin featured people posting pictures of themselves pretending to be asleep that were supposedly taken by their partners. Lexicographer Grant Barrett wrote that this was \"a kind of incompetent narcissistic guile which may capture the spirit of our age.\" \"Cooking for bae\" featured people posting photos of failed dishes, often called \"struggle meals\", supposedly created for their partners. \"You got a bae? Or nah?\" originated on Vine and featured people chanting the phrase.\n\nThe word's use in song lyrics dates to at least 2005, according to lyrics posted on Genius. In 2014, Pharrell Williams used it in the title of his single \"Come Get It Bae\". Chris Kelly of \"Fact\" wrote sarcastically that \"nothing says timeless like a song with 'bae' in the title\".\n\nThe word was a runner-up for the Oxford Dictionaries 2014 Word of the Year. Barrett nominated it for the American Dialect Society's 2013 Word of the Year.\n\nThe term has been adopted by corporate social media. The Twitter account Brands Saying Bae highlights the use of corporate Twitter accounts employing the term. \"The Verge\" labeled this use as an \"appropriation of urban youth culture\".\n"}
{"id": "2101485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2101485", "title": "Beat (acoustics)", "text": "Beat (acoustics)\n\nIn acoustics, a beat is an interference pattern between two sounds of slightly different frequencies, \"perceived\" as a periodic variation in volume whose rate is the difference of the two frequencies.\n\nWhen tuning instruments that can produce sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized. Tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be imperceptible. As the two tones get further apart, their beat frequency starts to approach the range of human pitch perception, the beating starts to sound like a note, and a combination tone is produced. This combination tone can also be referred to as a missing fundamental, as the beat frequency of any two tones is equivalent to the frequency of their implied fundamental frequency.\n\nThis phenomenon is best known in acoustics or music, though it can be found in any linear system: \"According to the law of superposition, two tones sounding simultaneously are superimposed in a very simple way: one adds their amplitudes\". If a graph is drawn to show the function corresponding to the total sound of two strings, it can be seen that maxima and minima are no longer constant as when a pure note is played, but change over time: when the two waves are nearly 180 degrees out of phase the maxima of one wave cancel the minima of the other, whereas when they are nearly in phase their maxima sum up, raising the perceived volume.\n\nIt can be proven (see List of trigonometric identities) that the envelope of the maxima and minima form a wave whose frequency is half the difference between the frequencies of the two original waves. Consider two sine waves of unit amplitude:\n\nIf the two original frequencies are quite close (for example, a difference of approximately twelve hertz), the frequency of the cosine of the right side of the expression above, that is , is often too low to be perceived as an audible tone or pitch. Instead, it is perceived as a periodic variation in the amplitude of the first term in the expression above. It can be said that the lower frequency cosine term is an \"envelope\" for the higher frequency one, i.e. that its amplitude is modulated. The frequency of the modulation is , that is, the average of the two frequencies. It can be noted that every second burst in the modulation pattern is inverted. Each peak is replaced by a trough and vice versa. However, because the human ear is not sensitive to the phase of a sound, only its amplitude or intensity, only the magnitude of the envelope is heard. Therefore, subjectively, the frequency of the envelope seems to have twice the frequency of the modulating cosine, which means the audible beat frequency is:\n\nThis can be seen on the adjacent diagram.\nA physical interpretation is that when\nthe two waves are in phase and they interfere constructively. When it is zero, they are out of phase and interfere destructively. Beats occur also in more complex sounds, or in sounds of different volumes, though calculating them mathematically is not so easy.\n\nBeating can also be heard between notes that are near to, but not exactly, a harmonic interval, due to some harmonic of the first note beating with a harmonic of the second note. For example, in the case of perfect fifth, the third harmonic (i.e. second overtone) of the bass note beats with the second harmonic (first overtone) of the other note. As well as with out-of tune notes, this can also happen with some correctly tuned equal temperament intervals, because of the differences between them and the corresponding just intonation intervals: see Harmonic series (music)#Harmonics and tuning.\n\nA binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear).\n\nFor example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear.\n\nBinaural-beat perception originates in the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the superior olivary complex of the brainstem, where auditory signals from each ear are integrated and precipitate electrical impulses along neural pathways through the reticular formation up the midbrain to the thalamus, auditory cortex, and other cortical regions.\n\nMusicians commonly use interference beats objectively to check tuning at the unison, perfect fifth, or other simple harmonic intervals. Piano and organ tuners even use a method involving counting beats, aiming at a particular number for a specific interval.\n\nThe composer Alvin Lucier has written many pieces that feature interference beats as their main focus. Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi, whose style is grounded on microtonal oscillations of unisons, extensively explored the textural effects of interference beats, particularly in his late works such as the violin solos \"Xnoybis\" (1964) and \"L'âme ailée / L'âme ouverte\" (1973), which feature them prominently (note that Scelsi treated and notated each string of the instrument as a separate part, so that his violin solos are effectively quartets of one-strings, where different strings of the violin may be simultaneously playing the same note with microtonal shifts, so that the interference patterns are generated). Composer Phill Niblock's music is entirely based on beating caused by microtonal differences.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38191512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38191512", "title": "Concept-driven strategy", "text": "Concept-driven strategy\n\nA concept-driven strategy is a process for formulating strategy that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of concepts (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.\n\nConcept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts (organizing principles) that \"works best\" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its \"Statement of Intent\" (or Purpose).\n\nMuch of the strategic management literature mutates Peter Drucker's call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. George Armitage Miller's modified The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two and dialectic suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.\n\nThe Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of decision making criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.\n\nLinguistic pragmatism argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.\n\nBagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.\n\nAnother example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. \nThe concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.\n\nThe steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:\n\n\nConcept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar strategic thinking approaches.\n\nGenerally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used. See Concept learning or Management Concepts.\n\nSome organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains. However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.\n\nSome organisations produce a 'strategic principles' statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.\n\nThe literature about 'corporate purpose' is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.\n\nThere is a connection between 'systems thinking' and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.\n\nThere is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'. The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.\n\nIn turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.\n\nPerhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', metaphoric criticism, or conceptual metaphor and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.\n\nThe term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on frame analysis but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. Amos Tversky defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.\n\nThe system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are organizing principle(s).\n\nAlso, as Karl Weick explains sensemaking as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.\n\n\n"}

The following opening paragraphs define imagination as the \"creative energy of the universe\", and introduces the book as a means by which to use the so-defined imagination to \"create what you \"truly\" want - love, fulfillment, enjoyment, satisfying relationships, rewarding work, self-expression, health, beauty, prosperity, inner peace, and harmony.\"\n\nGawain's book popularized a premise derived from the New Thought movement that began during the nineteenth century, primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom. The premise is that individuals have a mind containing mental content, including thoughts, images, memories, and predictions, which become manifested through the experience of living.\n\nAccording to advocates of New Thought, physical sickness and mental illness, as well as unfortunate circumstances, are the consequence of such mental content. Furthermore, they allege that when an individual controls, modifies, and regulates his or her mind and mental content, then material life and the experience of living alters accordingly, healing physical sickness, disability and psychological pain, and transforming destitution, indenture, and misery into wealth, autonomy, and happiness.\n\nGawain's book focuses primarily on making changes to visual mental imagery, and attributes to it the capacity for hindering or facilitating an individual's potential, citing vivid anecdotal stories drawn from her experience and that of others to support her thesis.\n\nSubsequent to the popularity of the book, the practice of Creative Visualization, as described by Gawain, remained a staple and stable feature within the New Age movement, self-help media, and popular psychology of the 1980s, 1990s, and first decade of the 21st century.\n\nThe belief in a universal life force or energy was and remains common to diverse ancient traditions, where it is variously named Qi or Ch'i in Chinese culture, (Traditional Chinese: 氣), (Simplified Chinese: 气), and Prana (Sanskrit: प्राण) in Indian Hindu-based philosophies, religion, and cosmologies, and thereby was not an original concept formulated by Gawain.\n\nThe claim that thoughts and visual mental images are composed of a universal energy described by Gawain in 1978 as the \"creative energy of the universe\", which can be brought under volitional control by Creative Visualization was amplified and exaggerated twenty-eight years later by the author and television producer, Rhonda Byrne.\n\nIn 2006, Byrne made a film called 'The Secret', and compiled a subsequent book of the same name, which made significant claims for the potential human use of such an energy, and popularized a maxim called the 'Law of Attraction', originally proposed in 1906 by New Thought author William Walker Atkinson, in his book \"Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World\".\n\nByrne's book and film \"The Secret\", and its rendition of the 'Law of Attraction', asserted three claims. Firstly, that thoughts and other mental content, such as visual imagery, is composed of 'pure energy'. Secondly, that this is the same energy that permeates everyone, everything, and brings order to the universe. Thirdly, that this energy obeys the principle of 'like attracts like', such that if you think negative thoughts, or visualize unpleasant or undesirable images, the energy of which those thoughts and images are allegedly made will attract the material manifestation of what you think and visualize.\n\nAccording to advocates of this maxim, including Bob Proctor, Neale Donald Walsch, and Jack Canfield, it is also logically reversible, such that negative or undesirable circumstances are to be interpreted as the causal outcome of negative thoughts and images.\n\nByrne's inspiration for \"The Secret\" \n\nThe concept of positive thinking has far-reaching implications in many arenas making it a dangerous ideology to promote. By simply thinking positively, people can “cure” themselves of physical diseases, such as cancer, and will often refuse medical intervention on such grounds. After The Secret aired on Oprah Winfrey, for example, a woman by the name of Kim Tinkham wrote a letter to Oprah telling her that she would be using positive mental imagery to fight against her breast-cancer diagnosis. In order to believe in the power of positive thinking to cure oneself of illness or improve one’s life circumstances requires that we sacrifice rational thought as it goes against everything we know about the way the world works. The cost of promoting the positive thinking movement results in lives lost as people begin to refuse medical treatments in favour of “curing” themselves. \nThere are other costs as well. For example, businesses that refuse to acknowledge any problems with their business strategies because it is seen as being too pessimistic. The person who does point out the flaws in business strategies is labelled as being all doom-and-gloom and an inadequate team player. In politics, it is also problematic because many campaigns and policy changes are promoted through the politicians’ sheer belief that a given policy or platform will be effective, rather than on the soundness of the policy itself. \nThe problems the positive thinking movement has brought upon the education system absolutely must be addressed. The influence of the positive thinking movement can be seen in the move towards an education system that values boosting self-esteem over educational accomplishment. The idea was that boosting self-esteem would lead to high academic achievement, but all that has happened is that we focus exclusively on boosting self-esteem to the detriment of education attainment. Teachers cannot fail children so they are being passed through every grade regardless of their performance or how much knowledge they have demonstrated, and can pass in assignments whenever it so pleases them. Such an educational system, which has been influenced by the positive thinking movement, is detrimental to society as a whole because it produces entitled kids who have no sense of responsibility, hard work, or accountability and likely will not be the kind of citizens who will contribute in a meaningful way to society. Furthermore, such children will find it difficult to succeed in a work environment where qualities such as responsibility, hard work, and accountability are still highly valued.\n"}

His main interest was in the history of Medieval philosophy.\n\nCallus was born at Żebbuġ, Malta, on January 20, 1888.\n\nCallus joined the Dominicans in 1903 at 15 years of age, and studied with them at Rabat, Malta (1905–08). In 1906, after receiving his Minor Orders, he was sent to Fiesole, Italy, to pursue his studies there. Four years later, in 1910, he obtained the degree of Lector in Theology and Philosophy from the University of Florence. At the same university Callus undertook studies in philosophy, history of art, and Semitic languages.\n\nIn 1910 Callus was sent to Rome where he was ordained to the priesthood on November 6 and pursued postgraduate studies at the \"Angelicum\" in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\".\n\nIn 1912 Callus was assigned to Rabat, Malta where he remained until 1921. At Rabat, Malta, he was appointed Acting Regent of Studies of the Studium Generale. In 1914 he was also appointed Professor of Dogmatic Theology at the bishop’s major seminary at Mdina, Malta.\n\nIn 1921 Callus went to England for two years. He settled at Hawkesyard, Staffordshire as Acting Regent of Studies. Here, he gave lectures and prepared the examination \"ad gradum\" for the Master of Sacred Theology degree which he obtained in 1924 at Rome’s \"Pontificium Collegium Internationale Angelicum\", the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\", (the degree was officially conferred a year later). That same year, Callus was sent to Viterbo, Italy, as Regent of Studies. He stayed here just over a year.\n\nOn May 1, 1924, was honored with the title \"Master of Sacred Theology\" bestowed by Procurator General of the Dominican Order. He then returned to Malta and was appointed Professor of Holy Scripture and Hebrew at the University of Malta (1924). He was also appointed Regent of Studies at the Dominicans’ Studium Generale at Rabat, Malta.\n\nIn 1931 Callus resigned from all of his offices in Malta and permanently left for Hawkesyard, and then, a year later, for Oxford, England, where he stayed until his death. Here he was engaged in predominantly academic and intellectual work. At first he became a research student, exercising himself further in paleography. Later, he became part of a group of distinguished scholars and intellectuals so as to study Medieval Theology and Philosophy. Callus thus continued to mature his philosophical views and to extend his already wide horizon of knowledge. In 1938 he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy being the first Dominican since the reformation to take a degree at Oxford. Two years later in 1940 he was appointed Regent of Studies at Blackfiars, Oxford, an office he held for twelve years. That same year, the University of Malta awarded him the title of Emeritus Professor. In 1943 he was elected Member of the Medieval Academy of America, and in 1946 he was elected Member of the Committee of the Medieval Latin Dictionary of the British Academy. A year later, in 1947, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and the following year he became the first editor of \"Dominican Studies\". In 1953 the University of Oxford conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts, and in that same year he was appointed Member of the Congregation of the University of Oxford. In 1962 he was also conferred the degree of Doctor of Literature ‘Honoris Causa’ by the University of Malta.\n\nCallus traveled far and wide lecturing and addressing seminars and conferences on Medieval philosophers, and expounding his own philosophy. On March 25, 1965, he was in Malta celebrating his diamond jubilee as a Dominican. A month later, while still in Malta, he was taken ill, and died on May 26 at the Dominican hospital of St. Catherine’s in Attard. He was buried at the cemetery of Żebbuġ, Malta, his birthplace, following an impressive funeral at the church of St. Dominic’s in Valletta.\n\nAccording to scholarly analysis and criticism, Callus’ academic and intellectual endeavour is divided between his ‘Malta Period’ (1912–1931) and his ‘Oxford Period’. His publications from the first period, though interesting, are not of much interest to philosophy. His best scholarly contributions are all part of the latter period. They are not very numerous in number – just 40 contributions – but all of a very high calibre, both scientifically and, sometimes, philosophically. These works are generally distinguished under three main headings, as indicated hereunder:\n\nThese are contributions on themes related to Medieval texts and manuscripts linked to Holy Scripture or Biblical studies.\n\n\nThese contributions deal with varied themes not classifiable under the other headings.\n\n\nCallus’ \"forte\" was related to Medieval manuscripts, texts and documents. These contributions are general in nature (grouped under the first heading below), related to Oxford scholars, theologians and/or philosophers (the second heading) or associated to a particular Medieval philosophical question, the so-called \"Unity of Forms\" (third heading).\n\nIn Genere\n\nOxoniensia\n\nUnitatis Formæ\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his advocacy of antinatalism in his book \"Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence\", in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious harm, regardless of the feelings of the existing being once brought into existence, and that, as a consequence, it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings.\n\nBenatar is the son of Solomon Benatar, a global-health expert who founded the Bioethics Centre at the University of Cape Town. Not much is known about Benatar's personal life as he deliberately guards his privacy. He has held antinatalist views since his childhood.\n\nBenatar is professor of philosophy and head of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. \n\nBenatar argues from the premise that pain is, in itself, a bad thing. His work has often been associated with contemporary philosophies of nihilism and pessimism. Benatar has stated his lack of approval toward the benevolent world-exploder view.\n\nNevertheless, he offers defenses of the corporal punishment of children and the circumcision of male infants (which he deems a matter for parental discretion).\n\nBenatar argues there is an asymmetry between pleasure and pain, which means it would be better for humans not to have been alive:\n\nBenatar argues that bringing someone into existence generates both good and bad experiences, pain and pleasure, whereas not doing so generates neither pain nor pleasure. The absence of pain is good, the absence of pleasure is not bad. Therefore, the ethical choice is weighed in favor of non-procreation.\n\nBenatar raises four other related asymmetries that he considers quite plausible:\n\nBenatar raises the issue of whether humans inaccurately estimate the true quality of their lives, and has cited three psychological phenomena which he believes are responsible for this: \n\nHe concludes;\"\n\nBenatar's \"The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys\" (2012) has been met with controversy: The philosopher Simon Blackburn writes: \"Benatar knows that such examples are likely to meet snorts of disbelief or derision, but he is careful to back up his claims with empirical data, and as a philosopher he is especially careful both about the interpretation of evidence and the use of terms such as \"discrimination\". [...] I do not at all doubt that there is a case to be made for the recognition of a second sexism, nor that Benatar makes it well. And it is not as if he himself is taking sides in these invidious comparisons. He is not a participant in the sex wars but a peacemaker who wants them to wind down. All that he aims to show is that if it is all too often tough being a woman, it is also sometimes tough being a man, and that any failure to recognise this risks distorting what should be everyone's goal, namely universal sympathy as well as social justice for all, regardless of gender.\" The philosopher Iddo Landau writes: \"Benatar suggests that in order to cope with the hitherto ignored second sexism we should not only acknowledge it but also dedicate much more empirical and philosophical research to this under-explored topic and, of course, try to change many attitudes, social norms, and laws. / This is a very well-argued book that presents an unorthodox thesis and defends it ably. It would be a useful text in both undergraduate and graduate courses in philosophy and gender studies, where it is certain to arouse a lot of discussion, much of it excited. [...] Most importantly [...] it is likely to change our understanding of gender relations.\"\n\nSuzanne Moore, a columnist for \"The Guardian\" and \"The Sunday Mail\", wrote: \"... abundant tripe trickles down from on high, even academe. Every so often a new tome details how men, not women, are discriminated against (apart from rape, murder, equal pay, genital mutilation, the power imbalance in politics, business, education, law and arts they may have a point). Things are tough for some guys. Really, I know that. I just find it hard to accept feminism has gone too far, that a bit of underarm hair signals the end of western civilisation.\" In a brief letter to \"The Guardian\", Benatar sought to correct some errors in Moore's account of his views; Benatar had predicted criticisms in the book: \"Given the prevailing orthodoxy in the academy and the sensitivity of the issues I shall be discussing, the views I defend in this book will be deemed threatening by many.

{"id": "1147032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1147032", "title": "Doctrine of equivalents", "text": "Doctrine of equivalents\n\nThe doctrine of equivalents is a legal rule in many (but not all) of the world's patent systems that allows a court to hold a party liable for patent infringement even though the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope of a patent claim, but nevertheless is equivalent to the claimed invention. U.S. Judge Learned Hand has described its purpose as being \"to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention\".\n\nGerman courts typically apply a three-step test known as Schneidmesser's questions. These questions are:\n\nAll of the above questions need to be answered in the affirmative in order to demonstrate equivalent infringement. In addition, an allegation of equivalent infringement needs to withstand the Formstein test. The corresponding question reads:\n\nIreland appears to subscribe to a doctrine of equivalents. In \"Farbwerke Hoechst v Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals (Eire) Ltd\" (1968), a case involving a patent of a chemical process, the High Court found that the defendant had infringed the plaintiff's patent despite the fact that the defendant had substituted the starting material specified in the patent claim for another material. Expert evidence showed that any technician who failed to obtain a good result using the specified starting material would try the replacement material. The two materials were therefore held to be chemically equivalent, and the replacement of one with the other by the defendant did not prevent a finding and injunction against him.\n\nOn 21 March 2013, the Federal Patent Court of Switzerland adopted an approach similar to the three-prong test applied in Germany. The court based its decision on the three questions:\n\nThe court denied equivalent infringement of EP0918791B3, since paragraph 19 of EP0918791B3 explicitly teaches that toxic chromium compounds may be replaced by metallic catalysts. A person skilled in the art would not consider the organic catalyst TEMPO as a solution of equal value to the ruthenium salts specified in claim 1. The answer to the third question was negative.\n\nThe court also ruled that there was equivalent infringement of EP1149840B1, since all questions of the three-prong test were answered in the affirmative. The court set forth that the replacement of the claimed p-Toluenesulfonic acid with pyridine/water constituted basic knowledge taught during the first years of an undergraduate course in organic chemistry.\n\nIn \"Urinal valve II\", the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland basically affirmed the three-prong test applied by the Federal Patent Court. The Supreme Court still partly reversed the Federal Patent Court’s earlier ruling on case O2014_002. The Supreme Court contended (reasons 6.4) that a second embodiment of the urinal valve fully implemented the key teachings of the asserted patent EP1579133, even though the second embodiment was not literally covered by the wording of the relevant claim. The Court went on to establish equivalent infringement.\n\nAs a signatory to the European Patent Convention (EPC), the UK is required to follow the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the EPC, which requires member states to draw a balance between interpreting patent claims with strict literalism (with the description and drawings only helping resolve ambiguity) and regarding the claims as a mere guideline only.\n\nThe United Kingdom had historically never employed a doctrine of equivalents approach. Instead, the UKIPO employed a purposive approach to assessing the scope of the claims, which applied to both patentability and infringement. The latest UK case law on claim interpretation is found in 'Improver Corp v Remington Consumer Products Ltd' (1990) and the House of Lords decision in 'Kirin-Amgen' (2004). The so-called 'Improver' (or Protocol) questions found in the former are a widely used three-step test for deciding direct patent infringement. \n\nIn July 2017, Lord Neuberger in \"Actavis UK v Eli Lilly\" introduced a new doctrine of equivalents test. The Supreme Court set out three questions to consider when determining whether a patent infringed the claims as an equivalent:\n\n\nThe first two questions must be answered in the affirmative, and the third question in the negative to demonstrate equivalent infringement.\n\nIn the United States, the doctrine of equivalents analysis is applied to individual claim limitations, not to the invention as a whole. The legal test, articulated in \"Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.\" (1997), is whether the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim is \"insubstantial.\"\n\nOne way of determining whether a difference is \"insubstantial\" or not is called the \"triple identity\" test. Under the triple-identity test, the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim may be found to be \"insubstantial\" if the feature in the accused device:\nas the limitation literally recited in the patent claim. See \"Graver Tank & Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.\", (1950).\n\nThe Court also explained that the doctrine of equivalents applies if two elements are interchangeable and a person with ordinary skill in the art would have known that the elements were interchangeable at the time of infringement.\n\nIn the United States, the doctrine of equivalents is limited by prosecution history estoppel. Under prosecution history estoppel, if the patentee abandoned through an amendment to the patent application certain literal claim coverage (e.g., by narrowing the literal scope of the patent claim), then the patentee is estopped from later arguing that the surrendered coverage is insubstantially different from the literally claimed limitation. The proposed equivalents also cannot cover, or ensnare, the prior art.\n\nThe United States also has a statutory equivalents doctrine that is codified in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6, which extends to structural equivalents. However, while the general doctrine of equivalents extends to technological equivalents developed after the issuance of a claim, the statutory structural equivalents in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6 extends only to equivalents available at issuance.\n\nAttempts have been made to harmonize the doctrine of equivalents.\n\nFor instance, Article 21(2) of 1991 WIPO's \"Basic Proposal\" for a Treaty Supplementing the Paris Convention states:\n\nThe EPC 2000, which came into effect on 13 December 2007, included an amended \"Protocol on the interpretation of \" intended to bring about uniformity at a national level between contracting states to the EPC when interpreting claims. The amended text reads:\nHowever, no definition of what was meant by an \"equivalent\" was included in the Protocol and it is expected that this lack of a binding definition will do little to achieve the desired uniform interpretation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6957743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6957743", "title": "Dvaitadvaita", "text": "Dvaitadvaita\n\nDvaitadvaita was proposed by Nimbarka, a Vaishnava Philosopher who hailed from Andhra Region. Nimbarka’s philosophical position is known as Dvaitadvaita (Bhedabheda vada). The categories of existence, according to him, are three, i.e., cit, acit, and Isvara. Cit and acit are different from Isvara, in the sense that they have attributes (Guna) and capacities (Swabhaava), which are different from those of Isvara. Isvara is independent and exists by Himself, while 'cit' and 'acit' have existence dependent upon Him. So, at the same time 'cit' and 'acit' are not different from Isvara, because they cannot exist independently of Him. Here, difference means a kind of existence which is separate but dependent, (para-tantra-satta-bhava) while non-difference means impossibility of separate existence (svatantra-satta-bhava).\n\nAccording to Nimbarka's Dvaitadvaita philosophy of differential monism, various philosophical terms are understood as follows.\n\nThe Highest Reality, according to Nimbarka, is Brahman, Krishna or Hari, a personal God. There is nothing that is equal to Him, nothing that is superior. He is the Lord of all, and Controller of all. He is called Brahman because of the unsurpassed greatness of His nature and qualities, because He is beyond any limit of any kind of space, time or thing.\n\nBrahman is the sole cause of creation, maintenance and destruction of the Universe. All beings arise from Him, nothing is superior to Him. The Lord alone is the first cause, the manifestor of all names and forms, and none else.\n\nThis Brahman is both the upadana (material cause) and the Nimitta (efficient cause). It is the material cause in the sense that it enables its natural saktis, viz. the cit and the acit in their subtle forms, to be manifested in gross forms; and it is the efficient cause in the sense that it unites the individual souls with their respective fruits of actions and means of enjoyments.\n\nNimbarka discusses two aspects of Brahman. On one hand, Brahman is eternal and great, the greatest of the great, the highest of the high, the creator, etc. of the Universe, high above the individual soul, of which He is the Lord and the ruler. But, on the other aspect He is the abode of infinite beauty, bliss and tenderness, and in intimate connection with the soul. He is the abode of supreme peace, supreme grace, and the ocean of all sweetness and charms.\n\nThus, Brahman possessed of attributes and adorable by all, has four forms or vyuhas (i.e., Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha) and appears under various incarnation as Matsya, Kurma etc.\n\nThe cit or individual soul is of the nature of knowledge (jnana-svarupa); it is able to know without the help of the sense-organs and it is in this sense that words like prajnana-ghanah svayamjyotih jnanamayah etc. as applied to jiva are to be understood. The jiva is the knower also; and he can be both knowledge and the possessor of knowledge at the same time, just as the sun is both light and the source of light. Thus the soul, who is knowledge, and his attribute, knowledge, though they are both identical as knowledge, can be at the same time different and related as the qualified (dharmin) and the quality (dharma), just as the sun and his light, though identical as light (taijasa), are still different from each other. Thus there is both a difference and a non-difference between the dharmin and dharma; and the extreme similarity between them implies, not necessarily their absolute identity, but only a non-perception of their difference.\n\nThe jiva is also ego (ahamarthah). This ego continues to persist not only in the state of deep sleep, (because our consciousness immediately after getting up from sleep has the form slept happily or knew nothing) but also in the state of liberation. It even belongs to the Parabrahman. Hence it is that Krishna refers to Himself so frequently in the first person in the Gita, of which the chief object is thus Purusottama, who is omniscient and at the same time non-different from the ego or asmadartha.\n\nThe jiva is also essentially active (kartr). This quality belongs to it in all its conditions, even after release. But the kartrtva is not independent. The jiva is also enjoyer (bhoktr) essentially in all its conditions.\n\nFor his knowledge and activity, however, the jiva depends on Hari; thus, though resembling Him in being intelligent and knower, he is at the same time distinguished from him by his dependence. This quality of dependence or of being controlled (niyamyatva) is the very nature of jiva even in the state of release, just as niyamyatva or the quality of being the controller, forms the eternal nature of Isvara.\n\nThe jiva is atomic in size; at the same time his attribute, knowledge, is omnipresent, which makes it possible that he can experience pleasure and pain in any part of the body, just as, for instance, the light of a lamp can spread far and wide and illumine objects away from the lamp. The Jivas are different and in different bodies, and so are infinite in number.\n\nThe acit is of three different kinds: viz. prakrta, aprakrta, and kala. Prakrta, or what is derived from Prakrti, the primal matter, aprakrta is defined negatively as that which is not the product of prakrti, but its real nature is not clearly brought out. These three categories in their subtle forms are as eternal as the cit or the individual souls.\n\n[Nimbarka does not explain what exactly the aprakrta is, nor does he define kala more precisely, beyond noticing, as pointed out above,that the aprakrta and the kala are species of the acit. But, Purusottamacarya of the Nimbarka school has, in his Vedantaratna-manjusa, described acit aprakrta as the material cause of the dhama(celestial abode) of Brahman and the bodies and ornaments etc.of Brahman and his associates.]\n\nPrakrti, or the primal matter-the stuff of the entire universe is real and eternal like the individual souls, and like them, though eternal and unborn, has yet Brahman for its cause. It consists of the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, such as prakrit, mahat, ahankara etc. (just similar to 24 principles of the Sankhyas).\n\nThe jiva has his true form distorted and obscured owing to his contact with karma resulting from ignorance, which is beginningless, but which can come to an end, by the grace of God, when its true nature is fully manifested. Ignorance is a part of God and is the basis of cosmic manifestation i.e. the arising of God with attributes.\n\nTo attain deliverance, the jiva has to commence with a complete submission to the Paramatman, or prapatti, whose six constituents are:-\n\n1) a resolution to yield (anukulasya samkalpah) \n2) the avoidance of opposition (pratikulasya varjanam) \n3) faith that God will protect (raksisyati ity visvasah) \n4) acceptance of him as saviour (goptrtva-varanam)\n5) throwing one’s whole soul upon him (atmaniksepah), and \n6) a sense of helplessness (karpanya).\n\nGod’s grace extends itself to those who are possessed of these 6 constituents of prapatti, i.e., who are prapanna; and by that grace is generated bhakti consisting of special love for him, which ultimately ends in the realisation (saksatkara) of the Paramatman. For a devotee knowledge of the following 5 things is quite necessary:\n\n1) the nature of the supreme soul, \n2) the nature of the individual soul, \n3) the fruit of God's grace or moksa, (which is an uninterrupted realisation of the nature and attributes of Brahman, following from the absolute destruction of all action and the consequent extinction of all sentience), \n4) the feeling of enjoyment consequent on bhakti, and \n5) the nature of the obstacles in the way of the attainment of God, such as regarding the body and the mind as the soul, depending on someone who is neither God nor the preceptor, neglecting their commands, and considering God as nothing more than an ordinary being.\n\nSri Nimbarka refers to 4 methods of sadhanas:\n\nPerformed conscientiously in a proper spirit, with one’s varna and asrama thereby giving rise to knowledge which is a means to salvation).\n\nNot as a subordinate factor of karma but as an independent means.\n\nIt is of three types. First is meditation on the Lord as one's self, i.e. meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the sentient. Second is meditation on the Lord as the Inner Controller of the non-sentient. Final one is meditation on Lord Himself, as different from the sentient and non-sentient.\n\nDevotion and self-surrender to guru.\n\nSri Nimbarkacharya made the \"Bhasya\" of the Bramhasutra on His Dvaitadvaita Vedanta (Principle of Dualism-Nondualism) in his famous book \"Vedanta Parijata Sourabha\".\n"}

An evolutionary fauna typically displays an increase in biodiversity following a logistic curve followed by extinctions (although the Modern Fauna has not yet exhibited the diminishing part of the curve).\n\nFauna I, known as \"Cambrian\", described as a \"Trilobite-rich assemblage\", encompasses the bulk of the fossils which first appeared in the Cambrian explosion, and largely became extinct in the Ordovician-Silurian extinction event. This fauna comprises trilobites, small shelly fossils (grouped by Sepkoski into \"Polychaeta\", but including cribricyathids, coleolids, and volborthellids), Monoplacophora, inarticulate brachiopods and hyoliths.\n\nFauna II, known as \"Paleozoic\", described as a \"Brachiopod-rich assemblage\", accounts for most of the fossils appearing in the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, and largely became extinct in the Permian-Triassic extinction event. This fauna is marked by fossils of the following classes: Articulata, Crinoidea, Ostracoda, Cephalopoda, Anthozoa, Stenolaemata, Stelleroidea.\n\nFauna III, known as \"Modern\", described as a Mollusc-rich assemblage\", arose largely in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Radiation, still in progress.The following classes are included: Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Osteichthyes, Malacostraca, Echinoidea, Gymnolaemata, Demospongiae, Chondrichthyes.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, John Phillips suggested three great systems: Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Caenozoic. Writing after Sepkoski, Brenchley and Harper suggested that there were two early evolutionary faunas before the three of Sepkoski: Ediacaran and Tomottian. They also point out similarities with four \"evolutionary terrestrial plant floras\": Early Vascular, Pteridophytes, Gymnospores, Angiospores; and three \"evolutionary terrestrial tetrapod faunas\": \"Megadynasty I (Carboniferous-early Permian)\" \"primitive amphibians and reptiles, most notably ... \"Dimetrodon\"\", \"Megadynasty II (early Permian-mid-Triassic)\" \"mammal-like therapsids\", and \"Megadynasty III (late Triassic-Cretaceous)\" \"included the age of the dinosaurs\".\n\n"}

The Firebug Working Group oversees the open source development and extension of Firebug. It had two major implementations: an extension for Mozilla Firefox and a bookmarklet implementation called Firebug Lite which can be used with Google Chrome.\n\nIn addition to debugging web pages, Firebug was used for web security testing and web page performance analysis.\n\nFirebug has been deprecated in favor of the integrated developer tools added to Firefox itself, whose functionality has been unified with those of Firebug. As Firefox 57 no longer supports XUL add-ons, Firebug is no longer compatible.\n\nFirebug 2.0 introduced many new features to the Firebug extension including JavaScript syntax highlighting, pretty print for minified JavaScript code, and a DOM Event Inspector to handle all event handlers on a web page. Additionally, users can search for page elements using CSS selectors in the search bar. The debugging tool now allows users to inspect JavaScript expressions as they are evaluated. Moreover, users can inspect values returned from JavaScript functions. It also adds the ability to create new HTML attributes for existing HTML elements.\n\nOn November 10, 2014, Firebug 3.0 was announced and an alpha was made available to the public. This version was to feature a new theme and would have focused on user experience.\n\nFirebug makes changes immediately and gives constant feedback to the user. All editors in Firebug support autocomplete.\n\nThe Firebug command line accepts commands written in JavaScript. The result of executing each command is displayed in the console, appearing as hyperlinks. The Firebug application contains multiple windows, splitting related features to a common window. Firebug also allows users to view the download time for individual files. It separates different types of objects, such as JavaScript files and images, and can determined which files are loaded from a browser's cache. Firebug also features the ability to examine HTTP headers and time stamps relative to when an HTTP request is made. Its net panel can monitor URLs that the browser requests, such as external CSS, JavaScript, and image files.\n\nThe HTML and CSS tools allow for the inspection and editing of HTML and CSS elements on a web page. Later versions of Firebug allow users to see live changes to the CSS. Visualization of CSS elements is shown while inspecting HTML elements. The Firebug layout tab is used to display and manipulate CSS property values. Furthermore, users can click on any visible HTML elements on a web page to access its CSS property values.\n\nFirebug's script tab enables users to set breakpoints and step through lines of code. Additionally, Firebug can navigate directly to a line of JavaScript code, watch expressions, call stacks, and launch the debugger in the event an error occurs during execution. Firebug can also log errors. Logging uses a Firebug JavaScript API. Firebug's JavaScript panel can log errors, profile function calls, and enable the developer to run arbitrary JavaScript. Firebug allows users to run JavaScript code through the command line and allows the user to log errors that occur in the JavaScript, CSS, and XML. Firebug provides a separate text editor to modify the JavaScript and see immediate results on the user's browser.\n\nAs provided in an update, the JavaScript command line features an autocomplete function. The text editor also provides the ability to write full functions. Firebug requires a user to refresh a web page in the event of a crash.\n\nMany extensions have been made to enhance Firebug. Since Firebug is open source, users can contribute their own extensions to the Firebug community.\n\nFlashFirebug is a paid Firebug extension that helps Flash and Flex developers debug Adobe SWF files on the web. FlashFirebug was developed by O-Minds and is licensed under the GPLv3.\n\nIn February 2012, O-Minds purchased the code to FlashBug, a competing Firefox extension. Flashbug had extensive capabilities to parse AMF and Shared Objects objects and partially decompile Adobe SWF files directly in the browser. Soon after the purchase, O-Minds integrated key features of FlashBug into FlashFirebug and retired Flashbug from the AMO repository.\n\nCurrently the extension displays textual Output from trace() commands within the Adobe SWF movie, a Display Tree with the hierarchy of display objects and their properties, viewers for AMF and Shared Objects, and a tool to modify the 3D transformation of any display object on the stage.\n\n\n"}

Variables are represented as nodes in a graph in such a way that variable sets \"X\" and \"Y\" are independent conditioned on \"Z\" in the distribution whenever node set \"Z\" separates \"X\" from \"Y\" in the graph. Axioms for conditional independence in probability were derived earlier by A. Philip Dawid and Wolfgang Spohn.\nThe correspondence between dependence and graphs was later extended to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and to other models of dependency.\n\nA dependency model \"M\" is a subset of triplets (\"X\",\"Z\",\"Y\") for which the predicate \"I\"(\"X\",\"Z\",\"Y\"): \"X\" is independent of \"Y\" given \"Z\", is true. A graphoid is defined as a dependency model that is closed under the following five axioms:\n\nA semi-graphoid is a dependency model closed under (i)–(iv). These five axioms together are known as the graphoid axioms. Intuitively, the weak union and contraction properties mean that irrelevant information should not alter the relevance status of other propositions in the system; what was relevant remains relevant and what was irrelevant remains irrelevant.\n\nConditional independence, defined as\n\nis a semi-graphoid which becomes a full graphoid when \"P\" is strictly positive.\n\nA dependency model is a correlational graphoid if in some probability function we have,\n\nwhere formula_8 is the partial correlation between \"x\" and \"y\" given set \"Z\".\n\nIn other words, the linear estimation error of the variables in \"X\" using measurements on \"Z\" would not be reduced by adding measurements of the variables in \"Y\", thus making \"Y\" irrelevant to the estimation of \"X\". Correlational and probabilistic dependency models coincide for normal distributions.\n\nA dependency model is a relational graphoid if it satisfies\n\nIn words, the range of values permitted for \"X\" is not restricted by the choice of \"Y\", once \"Z\" is fixed. Independence statements belonging to this model are similar to embedded multi-valued dependencies (EMVD s) in databases.\n\nIf there exists an undirected graph \"G\" such that,\n\nthen the graphoid is called graph-induced. \nIn other words, there exists an undirected graph \"G\" such that every independence statement in \"M\" is reflected as a vertex separation in \"G\" and vice versa. A necessary and sufficient condition for a dependency model to be a graph-induced graphoid is that it satisfies the following axioms: symmetry, decomposition, intersection, strong union and transitivity.\n\nStrong union states that\n\nTransitivity states that\n\nThe axioms symmetry, decomposition, intersection, strong union and transitivity constitute a complete characterization of\nundirected graphs.\n\nA graphoid is termed DAG-induced if there exists a directed acyclic graph \"D\" such that formula_13 where formula_14 stands for \"d\"-separation in \"D\". \"d\"-separation (\"d\"-connotes \"directional\") extends the notion of vertex separation from undirected graphs to directed acyclic graphs. It permits the reading of conditional independencies from the structure of Bayesian networks. However, conditional independencies in a DAG cannot be completely characterized by a finite set of axioms.\n\nGraph-induced and DAG-induced graphoids are\nboth contained in probabilistic graphoids. This means that for every graph \"G\" there exists a probability distribution \"P\" such that every conditional independence in \"P\" is represented in \"G\", and vice versa. The same is true for DAGs.\nHowever, there are probabilistic distributions that are not graphoids and, moreover, there is no finite axiomatization for probabilistic conditional dependencies.\nThomas Verma showed that every semi-graphoid has a recursive way of constructing a DAG in which every \"d\"-separation is valid.\nThe construction is similar to that used in Bayes networks and goes as follows:\nThe DAG created by this construction will represent all the conditional independencies that\nfollow from those used in the construction. Furthermore, every \"d\"-separation shown in the DAG will be a valid conditional independence in the graphoid used in the construction.\n"}

It was a project started in the 1970s in an attempt to preserve the knowledge of the indigenous thinkers in traditional African communities.\n\nHenry Odera Oruka was born on 1 June 1944 in Nyanza Province of Kenya. After his advanced level studies in Kenya, he went to Uppsala University in Sweden. There he registered for a BSc programme in the Faculty of Mathematics–Natural Science and studied Meteorology, Geography, and Geodesy. He later added Philosophy to his studies because of his interest in the subject. Upon graduating in Science and Philosophy (a year ahead of his class), he opted to drop science and continue with his studies in Philosophy. He moved to Wayne State University in the United States of America for his master's degree where he completed his studies and eventually obtained a PhD. His dissertation on the theme of \"Freedom\" (written in 1970) was later refined and published as \"Punishment and Terrorism in Africa\" in 1976. From October 1970 until his death on 9 December 1995, he taught Philosophy at the University of Nairobi.\n\nThe majority and dominant staff at the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies which had been launched in 1969 at the University of Nairobi were priests and lay theologians. They had little time for \"African Philosophy\" as they harbored doubts about the ability of Africans to think logically. After years of a sustained and bitter struggle spearheaded by Odera Oruka, Philosophy was separated from Religion at the university in July 1980 and he was appointed the Founder-Chairman of the new Department of Philosophy. Unfortunately for the Department, the death of Odera Oruka was accompanied with a marked decline in the international profile of Philosophy at the University of Nairobi. The discipline that Odera Oruka worked so hard to separate from Religion has since been merged with Religion once again.\n\nOdera Oruka was the founder-president of the Philosophical Association of Kenya (PAK); the founding-director of the International Institute of Environmental Studies(IIES), Nairobi; a member of the Kenya National Academy of Sciences (KNAS); the secretary-general of African Futures Studies Association (AFSA); the secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Philosophical Association (AAPA); vice-president of the Inter-African Council of Philosophy (IACP); a member of the Executive committee of both the Federation International de societe philosophique (FISP) and World Futures Studies Federation. On June 3, 1993, he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities from Uppsala University.\n\nOdera Oruka was married twice. His first wife, Millicent Achien'g, bore him three children: Owiso Odera (the deceased Hollywood actor), Sheila Odera (Veteran Actress/Model and Accountant), and Sharon Odera. He had two children with his second wife, Olivia Phoebe Ayoma, namely Ronnie Omuga and Peter Oruka Odera(an International relations practitioner).\n\nThree philosophical approaches can be seen in Okura's works:\n\nPoverty and hunger in Africa are the greatest constraints to mental development and creativity. But, rather than complaining about imperialism, colonialism, foreign cultural domination etc., the remedy should be looked for by a process of self-national examination and critique.\n\nThe fight against cultural and racial mythologies was one of his main topics. He differentiated two types of myths: Myths about the level of civilisation and nobility of some races as opposed to the backwardness and slave mentality of others. The second myth is about the philosophic-scientific gifts of certain races and the corresponding lack in other races, Africa always being on the ungifted and uncivilised side of the scale.\n\nHe divided the meaning of appearance into three parts. In the first part, he describes a reliance on outward appearance as a disease of most people in the society. The second meaning is appearance as it is manipulated by business tycoons and others in power to boost their rank and influence. In the third part, the philosophical level, appearance becomes an obstacle to intellectual activity. This type of appearance is prominent in the field of education, where people are taught styles rather than substance. The result is not knowledge but prejudice, racism, tribalism, sexism and irrational indifference to other cultures. This prompted him to analyse concepts to arrive at generally accepted truth rather than relying on mere appearance.\n\nThere has been considerable (and often acrimonious) debate about the pre-Western existence of an independent African philosophy and what its nature might be. Odera Oruka identified four trends or approaches in this discussion.\n\nDescribes the worldview or thought-system of particular African communities as philosophy. This type of philosophy sees the African way of thinking as \"communal thought\" and describes its emotional appeal as one of its unique features. Examples of those holding this position are: Placide Tempels, Leopold Sedar Senghor, John S. Mbiti, and Alexis Kagame.\n\nConsists of works of founding-fathers and statesmen in Africa, whose social-political theories were based on traditional African socialism and family values. Among them were: Kwame Nkrumah, Sekou Toure, Julius Nyerere, and Kenneth Kaunda.\n\nThis is the position generally taken by professionally trained students or teachers of philosophy. They reject Ethnophilosophy and instead adopt a universalistic point of view. In their opinion, African philosophy should be approached with the same forms of critical analysis applied to mainstream Western philosophy. A descriptive approach, by itself, is more appropriate to the field of anthropology and applies different standards to African thought. Philosophers belonging to this trend include: Kwasi Wiredu, Paulin Hountondji, Peter O. Bodunrin, and Odera Oruka.\n\nPhilosophic Sagacity is Odera Oruka's research project begun in the early 1970s designed to preserve the philosophical thoughts of traditional Kenyan sages. The basic principle of Philosophic Sagacity is that in both traditional and modern Africa there exist women and men, illiterate and literate, who commonly engage in philosophical reflection on various problems of human life and nature in general.\n\nUnlike ethnophilosophy, which emphasises communal thinking, Philosophic Sagacity searches for individual thinkers in the traditional community. These \"sages\" express and defend their philosophical thoughts and opinions on various issues of nature and human life. Some of these thoughts even if not philosophical in the strict sense could nevertheless constitute raw data for technical philosophical reflections by professional or trained philosophers. Oruka wanted to point out that there is and was a \"philosophy\" in Africa in the fullest sense of the word: a philosophy that deals with daily human problems and issues which are common to every human being, such as the existence of a Deity, life, knowledge, death etc. Such issues are not the sole domain of literate people but are usually best addressed by the few who can \"transcend\" the communal way of thinking.\n\nThough some have often equated \"Sage Philosophy\" with \"Philosophic sagacity,\" Odera Oruka did not. Odera Oruka distinguished between two wings of Sage Philosophy: (1) being the folk or popular sagacity, and (2) being the philosophic sagacity. While the former expresses well known communal maxims, aphorisms and general common sense truths, the latter expresses the thoughts of wise men and women that transcend popular wisdom and attain a philosophic capacity. Hence whereas all instances of philosophic sagacity locate within sage philosophy, not every instance of sage philosophy constitute philosophic sagacity. The novelty of Odera Oruka's project is to be found in philosophic sagacity since the folk sagacity dimension of sage philosophy would be a fallback to ethnophilosophy.\n\nOdera Oruka and his colleagues went with tape recorders into villages of different ethnic communities in Kenya to engage those who were thought by their own communities to be wise. The discourses were held in the native language of the presumptive wise men or women.\nEach \"wise statement\" was challenged by the interlocutors. If the person had a philosophical frame of mind he/she would be able to offer rational answers to the objections or requests for clarification. If he/she had not, he/she gave unsatisfactory answers or perhaps was unable to reply. It was believed by this method true philosophy could be separated from popular wisdom.\n\nPhilosophic Sagacity is not philosophy is the main argument of D. A. Masolo. Based on Socratic method, his analysis shows how frequently tradition and opinion are based on insufficient reasoning. For him, true philosophy relies on analysis, definition, and explanation. Pre-Socratic knowledge has no place in strict philosophy. Philosophic sagacity, he believes, falls into the category of pre-Socratic philosophy. Both fail in a consistent attitude towards, and practice of, rational explanation, despite the presence of the \"sage\" and the discourse with him/her. A mere discussion of a topic does not have the high degree of abstraction, conceptual analysis, and relation which, according to him, are the essence of strict philosophy.\n\nMasolo also objects to the Afrocentric perspective inherent in Odera Oruka's approach to treating pre-literate African men and women as proto-philosophers. This appears to be a misunderstanding. For Odera Oruka, Philosophic Sagacity lies between ethnophilosophy and professional philosophy and is simply a starting point in determining the nature of African Philosophy.\n\nIn his essay, \"The Philosopher and the Sage: On the Question of African Philosophy\", Peter O. Bodunrin rejects Odera Oruka's notion that philosophic sagacity is philosophy because, for him, literacy is a necessary condition for philosophical reflections. His second, related, objection is one common to anthropology: the influence of the observer. If a philosopher interviews a \"sage\", is the result really the work of the \"sage\" or a joint product? Who is the actual creator of the \"philosophy\"? Odera Oruka responded to such thought by pointing out that thinking normally precedes writing and that the intent of the discourses is to produce raw material, to be used by the philosopher in his effort to prove that true philosophy exists on African soil.\n\nAnthony Oseghare, a PhD student of Odera Oruka, makes a distinction between sagacity and knowledge. Both involve the acquisition and usage of skills, but they are not identical. Sagacity involves wisdom of a practical nature which is achieved through experience. It has a broader meaning than knowledge. Within sagacity too, there is a sagacity that stops with common sense and a sagacity that transcends common sense. Oseghare's critique, unlike Masolo's and Bodunrin's, is not negative but meant to clarify and enhance Odera Oruka's project.\n\nA point worth noting is the distinction between sages and prophets. They could be confused in that both are concerned with efforts to resolve problems that affect human society. It is also true that a sage can be a prophet and a prophet can be a sage but the critical fact is that they are not identical. The basic difference – according to Odera Oruka – is that the prophet claims to predict the future based on past experience, whereas a sage is concerned with fundamental issues of ethics and other questions of immediate importance. A sage has the ability to offer insightful solutions to practical issues. Sages have existed in every society as custodians of its culture and values, regardless of literacy. After Odera Oruka's death philosophers who have continued to push the agenda of sagacity include Kenyan born scholars F. Ochieng'-Odhiambo and Oriare Nyarwath together with American Gail Presbey.\n\nLesser known are Odera Oruka's contributions to ethical questions, such as protection of the environment and the justification of foreign aid.\nIn his article \"The Philosophy of Foreign Aid\" Odera Oruka responded to Garret Hardin's \"Life Boat Theory\". Hardin argues against helping poor nations because they will believe their problems are being solved, the population will grow, and the \"boat\" will sink.\n\nOdera Oruka gave three possible reasons to justify foreign aid: charity (common decency), promoting international trade, and historical rectification. He later added another argument: the \"right to a human minimum\".\n\nIn his article \"Parent Earth Ethics\" Odera Oruka uses the metaphor of a family of six children with varying degrees of wealth and poverty to explain his argument. These six children have some things in common and each has his/her own individual talents and possessions. He made the following distinctions:\n\nRule One: \"Parental Debt Principle\"\n(a.) Family Security Rule\n(b.) Parental Debt Rule\n(c.) Individual Family Survival Rule\n\nRule Two: \"The Individual Luck Principle\"\n(a.) Personal Achievements Rule\n(b.) Personal Supererogation Rule\n(c.) Public Law Rule\n\nThe entire system cannot be detailed within the scope of this article but, from the above outline, the main points are as follows: The \"Parental Debt Principle\" occurs prior to the \"Individual Luck Principle\". Under normal circumstances, if the first rule comes into conflict with anything in the second rule, the first rule takes priority. This is \"the ethics of common sense\". If the wealth and security of the community comes in conflict with personal luck or achievements, the former prevails over the latter. This type of ethics can be applied to both environmental concerns and the redistribution of wealth.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He received his PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles under the direction of Donald Piatt.\n\nFingarette's work deals with issues in philosophy of mind, psychology, ethics, law, and Chinese philosophy.\n\nIn his 1969 monograph \"Self-Deception\", Fingarette presents an account of the titular concept influenced by the work of Jean-Paul Sartre, Sören Kierkegaard and Sigmund Freud, as well as contemporary work in physiology and analytic philosophy. Fingarette argues that traditional accounts of self-deception fall invariably into paradox because these accounts see self-deception in terms of perception or knowledge. Such paradoxes may be resolved, Fingarette claims, by re-framing self-deception as a problem of volition and action. On these new terms, he defines self-deception as an agent's persistent refusal to \"spell out\" (explicitly acknowledge) and to avow some aspect of her engagement in the world.\n\nFingarette's 1972 monograph \"Confucius: The Secular As Sacred\" was described in a peer-reviewed academic journal as \"one of the most significant philosophical books on the subject to be published in a long time.\"\n\nFingarette has also influentially applied his work in moral psychology to pressing social and legal issues, particularly those surrounding addiction. In his 1988 book \"Heavy Drinking\", Fingarette gainsays the disease theory of alcoholism popularized by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous.

{"id": "317465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317465", "title": "Inference", "text": "Inference\n\nInferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences. Charles Sanders Peirce divided inference into three kinds: deduction, induction, and abduction. Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. Induction is inference from particular premises to a universal conclusion. Abduction is inference to the best explanation.\n\nHuman inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference.\n\nStatistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.\n\nThe process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called inductive reasoning. The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations. Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.\n\nThis definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: \"induction ... 3. Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances.\" ) The definition given thus applies only when the \"conclusion\" is general.\n\nTwo possible definitions of \"inference\" are:\n\nAncient Greek philosophers defined a number of syllogisms, correct three part inferences, that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning. We begin with a famous example:\n\nThe reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true, but logic is concerned with inference: does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises?\n\nThe validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word \"valid\" does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference. An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true. But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.\n\nFor example, consider the form of the following symbological track:\n\nIf the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.\n\nNow we turn to an invalid form.\n\nTo show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.\n\nA valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):\n\nWhen a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.\n\nA valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:\n\nIn this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.\n\nEvidence: It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the Soviet Union. You read in the Moscow newspaper that a soccer team from a small city in Siberia starts winning game after game. The team even defeats the Moscow team. Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore. The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.\n\nKnowns: The Soviet Union is a command economy: people and material are told where to go and what to do. The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.\n\nExplanation: In a command economy, people and material are moved where they are needed. Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better. In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good—such as on high-value weapons programs. It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team. The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern—that the small city was no longer small. Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere? To hide them, of course.\n\nAn incorrect inference is known as a fallacy. Philosophers who study informal logic have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many biases in human reasoning that favor incorrect reasoning.\n\nAI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of expert systems and later business rule engines. More recent work on automated theorem proving has had a stronger\nbasis in formal logic.\n\nAn inference system's job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The knowledge base (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are relevant to its task.\n\nProlog (for \"Programming in Logic\") is a programming language based on a subset of predicate calculus. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called backward chaining.\n\nLet us return to our Socrates syllogism. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:\n\nThis states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:\n\ngives the answer \"Yes\".\n\nOn the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:\n\ngives the answer \"No\".\n\nThis is because Prolog does not know anything about Plato, and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called closed world assumption). Finally\n?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in \"Yes\" (and in some implementations: \"Yes\": X=socrates)\nProlog can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.\n\nRecently automatic reasoners found in semantic web a new field of application. Being based upon description logic, knowledge expressed using one variant of OWL can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.\n\nPhilosophers and scientists who follow the Bayesian framework for inference use the mathematical rules of probability to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features—one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability \"probability logic\", following E. T. Jaynes).\n\nBayesian's identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that \"it's going to rain tomorrow\" has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.\n\nThrough the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see Bayesian decision theory). A central rule of Bayesian inference is Bayes' theorem.\n\nA relation of inference is monotonic if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is non-monotonic.\nDeductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.\n\nBy contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.\nWe know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible—that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of abduction, inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nInductive inference:\n\nAbductive inference:\n\nPsychological investigations about human reasoning:\n\n"}

He wrote about certain pathologies in children of immigrants. Hassoun examined the special problems they face in processing and transmitting what is mostly communicated to them through their parents' narratives of displacement, loss and exile. He was one of the first to evoke the heritage of the Jews of Egypt in modern times. He wrote about their history, customs, religious observance, and languages. He showed particular interest in the Karaite community. \n\nHassoun traveled to Egypt with groups of compatriots when Eqyptian president Anwar Sadat made it possible for Jews to visit Egypt. Hassoun wrote several works on the history of the modern Jews of Egypt, among them \"Histoire des Juifs du Nil\" (Minerve,1990), \"Alexandies et autres récits\" and \"Alexandries\" (a novel). He wrote eloquently of the culture of the Jews of Egypt and of their disappearance in the wake of Egyptian nationalism. \n\nHassoun was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1936 and settled in France in 1954 at the age of 18 where he was exiled after being accused and imprisoned by Egyptian authorities for communist activity. He remained in France for the rest of his life. Hassoun spoke French, Arabic, and Hebrew fluently.\n\nHassoun died from a brain tumor at age 63, in Paris.\n\nFor Hassoun, melancholy (or depression) stems from an individual's desire for some undesignated \"other\".\n\nIn Hassoun's model, the mother's attentiveness at the moment of weaning is crucial to the infant's sense of self. The mother must be seen by the infant to mourn, disapprove, begrudge, hesitate in the process of weaning. If she does not, the infant will recognize the mother's gesture as indifference. Melancholy is the result of the infant's sensing the mother's indifference at the moment of separation. Henceforth, he will be unable to mourn, having been unable to recognize loss in the mother's eyes. Weaning is a mirroring that leaves the subject both unable to mourn and unable to care—leaves the child in the state of melancholy. Melancholy for Hassoun is the result of a gesture that leaves the infant to suffer interminably for having spied the mother's indifference at the moment of weaning.\n\nHassoun said that the need to tell the past comes up when there's a crisis: when the individual grows up; when there's the urge to preserve a culture, etc. New facts means psychological effort to adapt, this can cause a person to reject that new things/ situation. People go back to the past when there's the need to adapt, because they consider experiences from the past a tool to survive. \n\nTelling the past does not mean telling somebody to follow traditions. Traditions subject the individual to follow patterns which may cause more damage than good. Retelling the past is another thing. It is never pure repetition but interpretation. Transmission takes the present into consideration when turning one's attention to the past. Without transmission all we have is nostalgia.\n"}

{"id": "24235334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24235334", "title": "Jewish existentialism", "text": "Jewish existentialism\n\nJewish existentialism is a category of work by Jewish authors dealing with existentialist themes and concepts (e.g. debate about the existence of God and the meaning of human existence), and intended to answer theological questions that are important in Judaism. The existential angst of Job is an example from the Hebrew Bible of the existentialist theme. Theodicy and post-Holocaust theology make up a large part of 20th century Jewish existentialism.\n\nExamples of Jewish thinkers and philosophers whose works include existentialist themes are Martin Buber, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Lev Shestov, Franz Kafka, Franz Rosenzweig, Hans Jonas, Emmanuel Levinas, Hannah Arendt, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, and Emil Fackenheim.\n\nJewish existentialism finds its roots in both the traditional philosophical school of existentialism and the peculiarities of Jewish theology, Biblical commentary, and European Jewish culture. Existentialism as a philosophical system grew as a result of the works of such non-Jewish thinkers as Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Martin Heidegger.\n\nThe Books of Ecclesiastes and Job, found in the Hebrew Bible and often cited as examples of wisdom literature in the Hebrew Biblical tradition, both include existentialist themes. The Book of Job tells the story of Job, who is beset by both God and satan by many hardships intended to test his faith. He ultimately keeps his faith and receives redemption and rewards from God. The Book of Job includes many discussions between Job and his friends, as well as between Job and God concerning the nature, origin, and purpose of evil and suffering in the world. The Book of Ecclesiastes is broader in scope and includes many meditations on the meaning of life and God's purpose for human beings on Earth. Passages in Ecclesiastes describe human existence in such terms as \"all is futile\" and \"futile and pursuit of wind\". Much Biblical scholarship and Talmud exegesis has been devoted to exploring the apparent contradiction between the affirmation of an all-powerful God's existence and the futility, meaningless, and/or difficulty of human life. Judaism's treatment of theodicy makes heavy use of the Books of Job and Ecclesiastes.\n\nSome of the trends in the modern philosophy of existentialism come from concepts important to early rabbinic and pre-rabbinic Judaism. William Barret's \"Irrational Man\", which traces the history of existentialist thought in the Western world, explains how the competing worldviews of Greco-Roman culture and Hebrew/Jewish culture have helped shape modern existentialism. Barrett says that the Hebraic concept of the \"man of faith\" is one \"who is passionately committed to his own being\". The Hebrew \"man of faith\", Barrett says, trusts in a God who can only know through \"experience\" and not \"reasoning\". Juxtaposed with the believing Hebrew is the skeptical Greek \"man of reason\" who seeks to attain God through \"rational abstraction\". The Greek invention of logic and the tradition of rational philosophical inquiry contributed to Existentialism. The Greeks invented philosophy as an academic discipline and as a way to approach the problems of existence, eventually resulting in the philosophical works of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, Kierkegaard and other existentialists. Hebraic thought trends had much more of an influence on the important concepts of existentialism. Much of modern existentialism may be seen as more Jewish than Greek.\n\nSeveral core concepts found in the ancient Hebrew tradition that are often cited as the most important concepts explored by existentialism, for example, the \"uneasiness\" \"deep within Biblical man\", also his \"sinfulness\" and \"feebleness and finiteness\". While \"the whole impulse of philosophy for Plato arises from an ardent search for escape from the evils of the world and the curse of time\", Biblical Judaism recognizes the impossibility of trying to transcend the world entirely via intellectualism, lofty thoughts, and ideals. As the late Jewish existentialist Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik (b. 1903–1993) articulates for a popular audience of secular Jews,\n\nIn the words of Barret, \"right conduct is the ultimate concern of the Hebrew\", and indeed for the observant Jew, according to R. Soloveitchik. Therefore, the Jewish tradition is differentiated from the Greek system of thought, which emphasizes correct knowledge, thinking, and consciousness as the passports to transcendence of the physical world. Some traditions of ancient Gnosticism, like the neo-Platonist desert cults, also subscribed to an idea similar to the Platonist ideal of \"true knowledge of the Good\" being a gateway to transcending one's ordinary, physical existence.\n\nThe philosophical school known as existentialism is generally regarded to have begun with the writings of the Danish Søren Kierkegaard (b. 1813 – d. 1855). Other important thinkers include the German Friedrich Nietzsche (b. 1844 – d. 1900), the French Jean-Paul Sartre (b. 1905 – d. 1980), and the German Martin Heidegger (b. 1889-1976). Various Jewish existentialists found influence in the secular philosophy of existentialism and have made various critiques and commentaries of the above-mentioned writers' works.\n\nBoth Judaism and existentialism deny the ability of human beings to permanently transcend the physical world and one's own normal existence. Theistic Judaism insists on a transcendent realm of existence beyond normal human reality, that is, the realm of God. As a way of connecting to God, Judaism directs its adherents towards the strict observance of laws, both ritual and ethical, in order to add meaning to the adherents' lives (see Soloveitchik's Halakhic Man for a further discussion of the concept of the Jew making meaning in his own life by observing the Halakha). Modern existentialist philosophy often denies the existence of a higher power, leading some to classify it as an agnostic or atheistic thought structure. Martin Heidegger's concept of man's \"thrownness\" into existence in the world causing him to be ill at ease/uncomfortable due to his very existence is similar to Hebraic man's \"uneasiness\" due to his inherently sinful nature. Both senses of being ill at ease in one's own skin are too inherent to the human condition to eliminate, according to Barret. Traditional Jewish thinkers and existentialist thinkers (both Semitic and gentile) have different solutions to this intrinsic uneasiness, also called existential anxiety or existential angst.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre's book, \"Anti-Semite and Jew\" (1948), is a direct connection between secular existentialist thought as philosophy and Jewish existentialism as an expression of a religious mode of thinking. Sartre's humanistic argument against antisemitism is that,\n\nEven out of the ashes of the Holocaust, Sartre insists on the supremacy and ultimate victory of rationalism over tribalism and hatred. The anti-Semite's hatred is just a misguided attempt to rid one's society of evil, which is itself a noble aim. Sartre ties his existentialist, universal humanism to Judaism by denying the difference between Jews and others. By denying Jews' \"Chosenness\" and explaining the Holocaust as a particularly nasty episode of utopianism gone wrong, Sartre offers hope to Jews worldwide. He insists that tribalism and pure hatred of the Jew as an aberrant outsider are not sources of anti-Semitism. He claims that \"If the Jew did not exist, the anti-Semite would invent him.\" Anti-Semitism is much more a reflection of the basic psychological need for a foreign object of hatred common in many people, according to Sartre. In many cases, this object of hatred for gentiles has been the Jewish people, who have functioned as the \"scapegoat\" of Europe for many centuries.\n\nPerhaps the preeminent Jewish existentialist is the Austrian theologian/philosopher Martin Buber. Buber wrote extensively on a variety of topics, including Biblical translation, Zionism, Hassidic culture, folklore and his concept of \"a philosophy of dialogue\". He made a major contribution to Jewish existentialism with his popular 1923 book \"I and Thou\" (from the German, \"Ich und Du\"). The book is concerned with the dual concepts of the \"I and You (Thou)\" and \"I and It\" relationship, which is Buber's attempt to answer several age-old existential questions about the meaning of human existence. Buber says that human beings find meaning in their relationships with other entities in the world, whether these are inanimate objects, other people, or even a spiritual force like God. This \"Begegnung\" (\"meeting\") between human and object is what gives life meaning for each individual human. Buber goes on to show how human beings define themselves in relation to the other, either the \"You\" or the \"I.\" He says that one's whole being is made by the relation one has to \"The Other\" – \"When one says You, the I of the word pair I-You is said, too...Being I and saying I are the same.\" And also, \"The world as experience belongs to the basic word I-It. The basic word I-You establishes the world of relation.\"\n\nThe latter parts of Buber's \"I and Thou\" are concerned with the possibility for unity of all being. Buber takes a leaf from the book of Judeo-Christian mysticism and Buddhism and explores the concept of the unity of all beings in the universe. Buber admits that as a practicality, and for purposes of life in the real world, \"In lived actuality there is not unity of being.\" Because of Buber's concept of the human being having his existence justified by each new interaction with an 'I' or 'Thou' object, his preferred brand of theology can be seen \"not as pantheism, but as panentheism: not that everything is God, but that God may be in everything...\"\n\nBuber wrote on a wide variety of topics. He wrote commentary on the socialist Zionist movement, classic gentile existentialist writers such as Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, and Nietzsche, and Hassidic folklore and culture, among many other topics from a variety of disciplines. In addition to all this, his concepts of the \"I and Thou\" dialectic and his \"philosophy of dialogue\" have become standard reading in the realm of positivist existentialist philosophy that seeks to bring meaning to human life. Ronald Gregor Smith writes, \"The authentic Jewish note of existential 'realization' is never hard to detect.\" Buber had an ultimately optimistic view of people's ability to find meaning in life through the Jewish religion.\n\nFranz Rosenzweig was a contemporary, colleague, and close friend of Martin Buber. The two co-wrote a variety of works, including a translation of the Hebrew Bible from the original Hebrew. Rosenzweig's best-known individual work is the epic \"The Star of Redemption\", a book of modern theology critical of modern philosophical idealism (embodied in Hegel's systematization of human life and thought structure) which has had a massive influence on modern Jewish theology and philosophy since its publication in the early 20th century. Rosenzweig proposes an alternative to modern philosophy's systematization of human existence in a paradigm shift from a sterile, removed modern philosophy of idealism and logic to a more Jewish, theistic system, emphasizing the primacy of the relationships between the world, Man (as human being), and God.\n\nHans Jonas was a Jewish scholar of religion and philosophy best known for his definitive work on ancient Gnosticism. His books and papers on Gnosticism and \"philosophical biology\" are considered an important part of early 20th century scholarship on these subjects.\n\nThe next phase of Jewish existentialism includes a variety of works addressing the horrors of the Holocaust, the term used to denote the German Nazi party's state-engineered genocide of approximately 6 million European Jews and approximately 11 million other 'undesirables' (including homosexuals, Romani, the mentally and physically disabled, Black People, and Slavic peoples) during World War II.\n\nThe paradox of theodicy has been of interest to theologians and philosophers (Jewish and gentile) for centuries. Theodicy, or the problem of evil, is a branch of theology/philosophy which explores the perceived contradiction of the existence of evil in the world with an all-good, all-knowing, all-powerful (omniscient and omnipotent) God. Talmudists and mystics in the rabbinic tradition explained evil as an absence or distance from God, rather than the opposite of God's all-powerful goodness. Examples include Job complaining to his friends about God causing him suffering, Maimonides' explanation of evil and suffering being the result of man's actions against God rather than God's actions or ill-will towards man, and Spinoza's emphasis on the impersonal nature of the universe and the efficacy of human reason in avoiding evil and suffering. Generations of pre-Holocaust Jewish scholars were able to come up with satisfactory explanations for the existence of both evil and an all-powerful, all-good, and infallible God in the universe.\n\nThese convenient logical arguments could not provide sufficient solace for a Jewish people emerging from the horrors of the Holocaust. Many scholars contend that the enormous tragedy of the Holocaust represents an entirely new category of evil that one could not explain with traditional Jewish theology. The preeminent survivor-novelist Elie Wiesel (1928-2016) raises a variety of unanswerable questions about the Holocaust in his novels, such as the best-selling \"Night\" (1958). Many Jews, whether they were survivors or not, experienced a loss of faith in the Jewish concept of God and even in the power of human goodness. Wiesel often repeats the sentiment that \"God died in Auschwitz\", which may be an allusion to Nietzsche's famous contention that \"God is dead\", and is representative of the theme of loss of meaning in life for a generation of Jews who experienced and witnessed the Holocaust. However, some Jewish theologians have come up with responses to the Holocaust without denying the existence of God entirely.\n\nEmil L. Fackenheim was a Reform-movement Rabbi and well-known Jewish theologian who wrote on post-Holocaust theology and coined the term \"the 614th commandment\". For Fackenheim, Judaism \"attempts to supersede the Holocaust\" by founding the State of Israel. The creation of the State of Israel by Jews committed to the renewal of Judaism and the welfare of their fellow Jews and 'the Jewish nation' represents for Fackenheim the emergence of a \"muscular Judaism\" not present in other generations of Jews.\n\nFackenheim's best-known work is \"\" (1982). In it, he coined the term \"the 614 commandment\" (which he also called the \"commanding Voice of Auschwitz\"), \"forbidding the post-Holocaust Jew to give Hitler post-humous victories\". Fackenheim encountered some criticism for his contention that it is worthwhile to maintain one's Jewish identity solely for the purpose of making sure that Hitler's genocidal plans are not fulfilled after Germany's defeat in World War II.\n\nRichard Rubenstein is a Jewish theologian whose work on Holocaust theology is considered foundational to the subject. His basic thesis in his most famous work, \"After Auschwitz: History, Theology, and Contemporary Judaism\" (1966) is that the Jewish conception of God must change in the post-Holocaust era. According to Rubenstein, Jews can no longer believe in an all-powerful, all-good, and omnipotent God; the contradiction inherent in such a God allowing the Holocaust to occur is too great. Rubenstein writes about \"God's guilt\" for allowing the Holocaust to happen. He affirms God's all-powerful nature, but suggests the possibility that God is not the all-good force of love that rabbinic Judaism has made him out to be. Rather, God may be an all-powerful enemy of the Jewish people, who has damned them to an eternal \"Chosenness\" of suffering.\n\nRubenstein also discusses in \"After Auschwitz\" the significant role that Christianity and various Christian churches (for example, the massive and politically powerful institution of the German Catholic church) had in allowing the Holocaust to occur. Rubenstein makes the point that it was not just the political and social trends of Nazism that allowed the Holocaust to occur; German Christians endorsed Hitler's aims both passively and actively.\n\nAlong with the work of secular, agnostic theologians concerned with the national destiny of the Jewish people, there has been a resurgence of religious Jewish thought since the 1950s. Some of the work of observant Jewish scholars is concerned with existentialist themes.\n\nAbraham Joshua Heschel wrote extensively on Jewish existentialist themes. Among his many works on Jewish theology are the books \"The Sabbath\" (1951) and \"Who is Man?\" (1965). The best-selling \"The Sabbath\" explores the concept of the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat) and its significance as a period of heightened connection between God and his creation of Man. Heschel's \"The Sabbath\" is also well known for the concept of the Shabbat as a \"cathedral in time\" (rather than in space, as cathedrals are in the Christian tradition). For Heschel, \"The Sabbath arrives in the world... [and] eternity utters a day.\"\n\nIn \"Who is Man?\", Heschel explicates his thesis that Man is a being whose ultimate purpose and task in life is to wonder about existence, to ponder and pine for his Creator. In his words, \"Man is a being in search of significant being, of ultimate meaning of existence.\" In \"Who Is Man?\", Heschel also constructs a famous dichotomy between \"biblical man\" and \"ontological man\". Heschel's concept of the \"ontological man\" is an explicit response to Heidegger's ideas about Dasein, which for Heschel is a human who merely exists passively, rather than lives actively as human in the world. A further difference between \"biblical\" and \"ontological\" man is that \"ontological\" man is stuck on basic questions of ontology (the study of the nature of being and existence) and only \"seeks to relate the human being to transcendence called being\" whereas the \"biblical man\" \"realizing that human being is more than being...seeks to relate man to a divine living, to a transcendence called the living God\". Heschel critiques Heidegger's stance toward seeking an understanding of Being as the ultimate reality without reaching out to a higher power while at the same time living actively in the real world (as \"biblical man\" does), saying,\n\nHeschel's work deals with man's relation to God and man's ability to make meaning in his own life through the sanctification of certain traditions, ideas, and time periods. Heschel's books (especially \"Who Is Man?\") are primarily concerned with the existential question of the purpose and meaning of human life, which is one of the foundational questions of theology concerning the relationship between human beings and God.\n\nHeschel is also reacting to Nietzsche's secular existentialism in \"Who Is Man?\" In reaction to Nietzsche's assertion that man must make meaning for himself by his \"will to power\" in an indifferent universe, Heschel cites human being's obsession with finding meaning outside of themselves as evidence of the existence of a higher being. He says, \"To be overtaken with awe of God is not to entertain a feeling but to share in a spirit that permeates all being.\" For Heschel, man's proclivity to be in awe of God is an important part of the make-up of all humans. He can be said to be an \"experiential Jew\" concerned with the interior experience of God as the primary mode of popular religious experience. Rabbi Soloveitchik (see above) would call Heschel an \"homo religiosus\". Heschel is also reacting to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche's secular existentialism in \"Who Is Man?\" Heschel can be said to be an \"experiential Jew\" or a \"homo religious\" (\"religious man\") \"totally devoted and given over to a cosmos that is filled with divine secrets and eternal mysteries\".\n\nIn \"Halakhic Man\", Joseph Soloveitchik responds to Kierkegaard and Heschel's emphasis on the interiority of religious experience. Both Heschel (an extremely knowledgeable scholar of Judaism who was a rabbi in the mystical Hassidic tradition) and Kierkegaard (who wrote extensively on the internal struggle to know God as the primary mode of religious experience) would be considered examples of \"religious man\" for Soloveitchik. In \"Halakhic Man\", Soloveitchik seeks to shift the paradigm of religion from one of \"religious experience\", consciousness, and interiority (i.e. profound meditations of the nature of the soul, the self, and God) to a more worldly \"Lawfulness\". According to Soloveitchik, Halakha (the Jewish code of law) is a better expression of religious identity and passion than the unthinking mysticism and piety of the religious or spiritual human. After all, Halakhic (lawful) man is motivated by a \"passionate love of the truth\" and all his actions are intended to bring him closer to God and God closer to the world. This more worldly approach to Judaism not only allows the human being to approach God, but also brings God closer to the world. This is because following the \"mitzvoth\" contained within the \"halakha\" is a positive moral action which improves the world and the person obeying the mitzvoth.\n\nThroughout the book, Soloveitchik often returns to his three-part construction of the \"cognitive man\", the \"religious man\", and the \"Halakhic man\". \"Cognitive man\" is a modern, scientifically-minded rational human who seeks to rationalize everything and explain occurrences in terms of rule-following natural phenomena. \"Religious man\" is a mystical believer in divine mysteries and internal ecstatic religious experience. \"Halakhic man\" takes the analytic, rational nature of \"scientific man\" and combines it with the love of the divine central to religious man's character. Halakhic man is also committed to living under God's law.\n\nKierkegaard says that to love one's neighbor perfectly as Jesus did is \"the fulfilling of the law\". However, R. Soloveitchik would say in response that \"living under the law\" requires much more than \"loving the neighbor\" and points to a much larger body of law (Jewish Halakha) that gives the Jew the ability to connect to God in a much more concrete way. In general, Christianity de-emphasizes law and the Torah's commandments, emphasizing faith in God and general morality. Judaism emphasizes law and the Commandments. Soloveitchik's purpose in writing \"Halakhic Man\" is to explain to the secular Jew and other lay-readers the benefits of Orthodox Judaism's focus on externalized law over internalized faith as a way for humans to add meaning to their own lives and transcend their base humanity. For the Halakhic man, being religious and spiritual is not about correct mindfulness alone (though this may have its part in the religious experience) but is rather about right action. Right moral action is part and parcel in following God's Halakha, given to the Jews as part of the Torah at Sinai.\n\nA classic example from the book of \"Halakhic Man\" using the law to add meaning to his own life is Soloveitchik's explanation of the religious Jew's reaction to a beautiful sunrise or sunset:\n\nInstead of simply wondering at the beauty and mystery of God's creation as the mystic \"religious man\" (like Kierkegaard or Heschel), Soloveitchik's \"Halakhic man\" has rigorous laws to follow for every new natural phenomena and life cycle event he encounters, thereby sanctifying his life and the existence of the universe with each day. The Halakha is Soloveitchik's answer to the question of how to make a human being's life meaningful.\n\n"}

{"id": "78219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78219", "title": "Masanobu Fukuoka", "text": "Masanobu Fukuoka\n\nHe was a proponent of no-till, no-herbicide grain cultivation farming methods traditional to many indigenous cultures, from which he created a particular method of farming, commonly referred to as \"natural farming\" or \"do-nothing farming\".\n\nFukuoka was the author of several Japanese books, scientific papers and other publications, and was featured in television documentaries and interviews from the 1970s onwards. His influences went beyond farming to inspire individuals within the natural food and lifestyle movements. He was an outspoken advocate of the value of observing nature's principles.\n\nFukuoka was born on 2 February 1913 in Iyo, Ehime, Japan, the second son of Kameichi Fukuoka, an educated and wealthy land owner and local leader. He attended Gifu Prefecture Agricultural College and trained as a microbiologist and agricultural scientist, beginning a career as a research scientist specialising in plant pathology. He worked at the Plant Inspection Division of the Yokohama Customs Bureau in 1934 as an agricultural customs inspector. In 1937 he was hospitalised with pneumonia, and while recovering, he stated that he had a profound spiritual experience that transformed his world view and led him to doubt the practices of modern \"Western\" agricultural science. He immediately resigned from his post as a research scientist, returning to his family's farm on the island of Shikoku in southern Japan.\nFrom 1938, Fukuoka began to practise and experiment with new techniques on organic citrus orchards and used the observations gained to develop the idea of \"Natural Farming\". Among other practices, he abandoned pruning an area of citrus trees, which caused the trees to become affected by insects and tangled branches. He stated that the experience taught him the difference between nature and non-intervention. His efforts were interrupted by World War II, during which he worked at the Kōchi Prefecture agricultural experiment station on subjects including farming research and food production.\nIn 1940, Fukuoka married his wife Ayako, and they had five children together. After World War II, his father lost most of the family lands due to forced redistribution policies of the American occupying forces and was left with only three-eighths of an acre of rice land and the hillside citrus orchards his son had taken over before the war. Despite these setbacks, in 1947 he took up natural farming again with success, using no-till farming methods to raise rice and barley. He wrote his first book, \"Mu 1: The God Revolution\", or \"Mu 1: Kami no Kakumei\" () in Japanese, during the same year, and worked to spread word of the benefits of his methods and philosophy. His later book, \"The One-Straw Revolution\", was published in 1975 and translated into English in 1978.\n\nFrom 1979, Fukuoka travelled the world extensively, giving lectures, working directly to plant seeds and re-vegetate areas, and receiving a number of awards in various countries in recognition of his work and achievements. By the 1980s, Fukuoka recorded that he and his family shipped some 6,000 crates of citrus to Tokyo each year, totalling about 90 tonnes.\n\nDuring his first journey overseas, Fukuoka was accompanied by his wife Ayako, met macrobiotic diet leaders Michio Kushi and Herman Aihara, and was guided by his leading supporter and translation editor Larry Korn. They sowed seeds in desertified land, visited the University of California in Berkeley and Los Angeles, the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, the Lundberg Family Farms, and met with United Nations UNCCD representatives including Maurice Strong, who encouraged Fukuoka's practical involvement in the \"Plan of Action to Combat Desertification\". He also travelled to New York City and surrounding areas such as Boston and Amherst College in Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1983, he travelled to Europe for 50 days holding workshops, educating farmers and sowing seeds. In 1985, he spent 40 days in Somalia and Ethiopia, sowing seeds to re-vegetate desert areas, including working in remote villages and a refugee camp. The following year he returned to the United States, speaking at three international conferences on natural farming in Washington state, San Francisco and at the Agriculture Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Fukuoka also took the opportunity to visit farms, forests and cities giving lectures and meeting people. In 1988, he lectured at the Indian Science Congress, state agricultural universities and other venues.\n\nFukuoka went to Thailand in 1990 and 1991, visiting farms and collecting seeds for re-vegetating deserts in India, which he returned to during November and December that year in an attempt to re-vegetate them. The next year saw him participate in official meetings in Japan associated with the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil, and in 1996 he returned to Africa, sowing seeds in desert areas of Tanzania, observing baobab trees and jungle country. He taught the making and sowing of clay seed balls in Vietnam during 1995.\n\nHe travelled to the Philippines in 1998, carrying out Natural Farming research, and visited Greece later that year to assist plans to re-vegetate 10,000 hectares around the Lake Vegoritis area in the Pella regional unit and to produce a film of the major seed ball effort. The next year he returned to Europe, visiting Mallorca.\n\nHe visited China in 2001, and in 2002 he returned again to India to speak at the \"Nature as Teacher\" workshop at Navdanya Farm and at Bija Vidyapeeth Earth University in Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand in northern India. On Gandhi's Day, he gave the third annual Albert Howard Memorial Lecture to attendees from all six continents. That autumn he was to visit Afghanistan with Yuko Honma but was unable to attend, shipping eight tons of seed in his stead. In 2005, he gave a brief lecture at the World Expo in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, and in May 2006 he appeared in an hour-long interview on Japanese television network NHK.\n\nMasanobu Fukuoka died on 16 August 2008 at the age of 95, after a period of confinement in bed and in a wheelchair.\n\nFukuoka called his agricultural philosophy , most commonly translated into English as \"natural farming\". It is also referred to as \"the Fukuoka Method\", \"the natural way of farming\" or \"Do-Nothing Farming\".\n\nThe system is based on the recognition of the complexity of living organisms that shape an ecosystem and deliberately exploiting it. Fukuoka saw farming not just as a means of producing food but as an aesthetic and spiritual approach to life, the ultimate goal of which was \"the cultivation and perfection of human beings\".\n\nThe five principles of natural farming are that:\n\n\nFukuoka re-invented and advanced the use of clay seed balls. Clay seed balls were originally an ancient practice in which seeds for the next season's crops are mixed together, sometimes with humus or compost for microbial inoculants, and then are rolled within clay to form into small balls. This method is now commonly used in guerilla gardening to rapidly seed restricted or private areas.\n\nIn 1988, Fukuoka received Visva-Bharati University's Desikottam Award as well as the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in the Philippines, often considered \"Asia's Nobel Prize\".\n\nIn March 1997, the Earth Summit+5 forum in Rio de Janeiro presented him with the Earth Council Award, received in person at a ceremony in Tokyo on 26 May of that year, honouring him for his contributions to sustainable development.\n\nIn 1998, Fukuoka received a grant of US$10,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, but the grant was returned because his advanced age prevented him from completing the project.\n\nIn the international development of the organic farming movement, Fukuoka is considered to be amongst the \"five giant personalities who inspired the movement\" along with Austrian Rudolf Steiner, German-Swiss Hans Müller, Lady Eve Balfour in the United Kingdom and J.I. Rodale in the United States.\n\nHis books are considered both farming compendiums and guides to a way of life.\n\n\"The One-Straw Revolution\" has been translated into over 20 languages and sold more than one million copies and Fukuoka has been widely influential, inspiring an international movement of individuals discovering and applying his principles to varying degrees, such as Akinori Kimura, David Mas Masumoto and Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, and has significantly influenced alternative movements in the West, such as permaculture.\n\nRosana Tositrakul, a Thai activist and politician, spent a year studying with Fukuoka on his farm. She then organised a visit by Fukuoka to the Kut Chum District of northern Thailand, which, together with his books, were influential in the rapid and widespread adoption of organic and chemical-free rice farming in the district.\n\nIn the preface to the US editions of \"The One-Straw Revolution\", Wendell Berry wrote that Fukuoka's techniques are not \"directly applicable to \nmost American farms,\" but ultimately concludes that it would be \"a mistake to assume that the practical passages of this book are worthless...\" suggesting that Natural Farming would require farmers to have fresh eyes and the right kind of concern for their land in order to come up with methods relevant to their own farms.\n\nFukuoka's techniques have proven difficult to apply, even on most Japanese farms, and have been described as a sophisticated approach despite their simple appearance. In the initial years of transition from conventional farming there are losses in crop yields. Fukuoka estimated these to be 10% while others, such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, have found attempting to strictly follow Fukuoka's techniques lead to crop failures and require many years of adaption to make the principles work.\n\nTheodor Friedrich and Josef Kienzle of the Food and Agriculture Organization opined that his rejection of mechanisation is not justifiable for modern agricultural production and that the system cannot interact effectively with conventional agricultural systems.\n\nIn Japan, where Fukuoka had few followers or associates, his critics argue that the \"inner world and the connection between humans and nature does not, however, exhaust reality\" and that he did not give sufficient attention to interpersonal relationships or society.\n\nFukuoka's farm in Shikoku was taken over by his son and daughter-in-law in the late 1980s, as Fukuoka reached an advanced age. His grandson also took up farming. Many of the farm's iyokan and amanatsu mikan trees remain, although some old iyokan were replaced by new varieties of fruit. Woodlands remain along with orchards, including some areas of wild vegetables still growing amongst them. Some areas of straw-mulched cropping continue to produce grains and vegetables. The farm also features an orchard area of ginkgo trees, shiitake mushroom crops growing on tree logs in shady woodland, and plantings of limes, grapefruits, feijoas, avocados and mangoes.\n\nThe farm is now run using some natural farming techniques: no chemicals, no tillage of the land and no use of composting. Other techniques have been changed; the pattern of irrigation is more conventional to reduce conflicts with neighbours. A do-nothing philosophy has been followed on the hilltop surrounding Fukuoka's hut. Here it has become a natural, fruit-bearing forest with minimal intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A common and easier variant is Ardha Matsyendrasana (, from ardha, half. The asana usually appears as a seated spinal twist with many variations, and in its half form is one of the twelve basic asanas in many systems of hatha yoga.\n\nThe name comes from the Sanskrit words \"ardha\" meaning \"half\", Matsyendra, one of the founders of hatha yoga, (whose name in turn means \"lord of the fishes\") and \"asana\" (आसन ) meaning \"posture\" or \"seat\".\n\nOne foot is placed flat on the floor outside the opposite leg and torso twists toward the top leg. The bottom leg may be bent with the foot outside the opposite hip or extended with toes vertically. The arms help leverage the torso into the twist and may be bound (Baddha Ardha Matsyendrasana) in a number of configurations by clutching either feet or opposite hands.\n\nIn this pose, sit with one leg bent on the ground, the foot tucked in close to the body, and cross the other leg over across the body, the knee raised and bent, and the foot on the ground by the outside of the other leg. Twist the body and grasp the raised knee; or, bring the arm over to press against the raised knee; or clasp the hands behind the back.\nFrom Ardha Matsyendrasana I, the bottom leg moves into Padmasana (Lotus Position) and arms bind by grabbing either foot.\n\nArdha Matsyendrāsana allows the spine to be twisted all the way from the base of the spine to the very top. This asana is said to tone the spinal nerves and ligaments, and improves digestion and also improve liver and pancreas health The \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\" states that it increases appetite, destroys diseases, and rouses kundalini in the body.\n\n\n\n"}

Menzan's scholarship was part of the Tokugawa movement of returning to original historical sources to revitalize Zen ( \"fukko\", \"return to the old\"), especially the works of Dōgen Zenji. Before Menzan the works of Dōgen were not widely studied or put into practice, he helped revitalize the Sōtō school by analyzing and building on Dogen's writings. Menzan used Dōgen to promote a reform of the Sōtō sect, which included reforming the monastic code and meditation practice. Due to Menzan's efforts, Dōgen studies now occupies a central position in Sōtō Zen thought. Menzan wrote to advocate the use of the old Song dynasty monk's hall system, in which monks ate, slept, and meditated in one large monk's hall, rather than in separate rooms as was commonly practiced in Japan at the time. Menzan was the most prolific Sōtō zen scholar, having written over a hundred titles of detailed scholarship on monastic regulations, precepts, ordination, dharma transmission and philology.

{"id": "6432760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6432760", "title": "Neo-scholasticism", "text": "Neo-scholasticism\n\nNeo-scholasticism (also known as neo-scholastic Thomism or neo-Thomism because of the great influence of the writings of Thomas Aquinas on the movement), is a revival and development of medieval scholasticism in Roman Catholic theology and philosophy which began in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nDuring the medieval period, scholasticism became the standard accepted method of philosophy and theology. The Scholastic method declined with the advent of humanism in the 15th and 16th centuries, after which time it came to be viewed by some as rigid and formalistic. \"Scholastic philosophy did not, however, completely disappear. An important movement of Thomistic revival took place during the 16th century and enriched Scholastic literature with many eminent contributions. Thomas de Vio Cajetan (1469–1534), Gabriel Vásquez (1551–1604), Toletus (1532–1596), Fonseca (1528–1599), and especially Francisco Suárez (1548–1617) were profound thinkers, worthy of the great masters whose principles they had adopted.\" Moreover, as J. A. Weisheipl O.P. emphasizes, within the Dominican Order Thomistic scholasticism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas: \"Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology.\" A further idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican scholasticism and neo-scholasticism may be derived from the list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\nIn the mid–19th century, interest in Roman Catholic circles in scholastic methodology and thought began once again to flourish, in large part in reaction against the \"Modernism\" inspired by thinkers such as Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, the use of which was perceived as inimical to Christian doctrine. The meaning and core beliefs of theological Modernism were never tightly defined; in large part, Modernism simply represented that which was attacked by Rome in 1907 as ‘the sum of all heresies’. Moreover, given that Modernism remained the perceived enemy of neo-Scholasticism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were certainly changes over the decades in what was attacked. Certainly, however, common threads of thought can be detected. These include (1) the belief that revelation continued up to and including the present day and, therefore, did not stop with the death of the last apostle; (2) the belief that dogmas were not immutable and that ecclesial dogmatic formulas could change both in interpretation and in content; (3) the use of the historical-critical method in biblical exegesis.\n\nFor many thinkers, the dangers of Modernism could only be overcome by a complete return to scholastic theology. In particular, Catholic interest came to focus on the 13th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas, whose writings were increasingly viewed as the ultimate expression of philosophy and theology, to which all Catholic thought must remain faithful.\n\nThis was particularly vigorous at first in Italy. \"The direct initiator of the neo-Scholastic movement in Italy was Gaetano Sanseverino, (1811–1865), a canon at Naples.\" The German Jesuit J Kleutgen (1811–83), who taught at Rome, was a particularly influential figure in his defences of pre-modern theology and philosophy, his argument that a theology based upon a post-Cartesian philosophy undermined Catholic doctrine, and his recommendation that the Aristotelian scientific method of Aquinas was the theology the Church now needed. The Accademia di San Tommaso, founded in 1874, published until 1891 a review entitled \"La Scienza Italiana\". Numerous works were produced by Giovanni Maria Cornoldi (1822–92), Giuseppe Pecci, Tommaso Maria Zigliara (1833–93), Satolli (1839–1909), Liberatore (1810–92), Barberis (1847–96), Schiffini (1841–1906), de Maria, Talamo, Lorenzelli, Ballerini, Matussi and others. The Italian writers at first laid special emphasis on the metaphysical features of Scholasticism, and less to the empirical sciences or to the history of philosophy.\n\nPapal support for such trends had begun under Pope Pius IX, who had recognized the importance of the movement in various letters. The dogma of the Immaculate Conception (1854), the \"Syllabus errorum\" (1864) and the proclamation of papal infallibility (1870) all heralded a move away from Modernist forms of theological thought.\n\nThe most important moment for the spread of the movement occurred with Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical \"Aeterni Patris\", issued on 4 August 1879. \"Aeterni Patris\" set out what would come to be seen as the principles of neo-scholasticism, and provided the stimulus for the donation of increased support to neo-scholastic thought. It called for ‘Christian philosophy to be restored according to the spirit of St Thomas’.\n\nNeo-scholasticism sought to restore the fundamental doctrines embodied in the scholasticism of the 13th century. The essential conceptions may be summarized as follows:\n\n1. God, pure actuality and absolute perfection, is substantially distinct from every finite thing: He alone can create and preserve all beings other than Himself. His infinite knowledge includes all that has been, is, or shall be, and likewise all that is possible.\n\n2. As to our knowledge of the material world: whatever exists is itself, an incommunicable, individual substance. To the core of self-sustaining reality, in the oak-tree for instance, other realities (accidents) are added—size, form, roughness, and so on. All oak-trees are alike, indeed are identical in respect of certain constituent elements. Considering this likeness and even identity, our human intelligence groups them into one species and again, in view of their common characteristics, it ranges various species under one genus. Such is the Aristotelean solution of the problem of universals. Each substance is in its nature fixed and determined; and nothing is farther from the spirit of Scholasticism than a theory of evolution which would regard even the essences of things as products of change.\n\nBut this statism requires as its complement a moderate dynamism, and this is supplied by the central concepts of act and potency. Whatsoever changes is, just for that reason, limited. The oak-tree passes through a process of growth, of becoming: whatever is actually in it now was potentially in it from the beginning. Its vital functions go on unceasingly (accidental change); but the tree itself will die, and out of its decayed trunk other substances will come forth (substantial change). The theory of matter and form is simply an interpretation of the substantial changes which bodies undergo. The union of matter and form constitutes the essence of concrete being, and this essence is endowed with existence. Throughout all change and becoming there runs a rhythm of finality; the activities of the countless substances of the universe converge towards an end which is known to God; finality involves optimism.\n\n3. Man, a compound of body (matter) and of soul (form), puts forth activities of a higher order—knowledge and volition. Through his senses he perceives concrete objects, e.g. this oak; through his intellect he knows the abstract and universal (the oak). All our intellectual activity rests on sensory function; but through the active intellect (intellectus agens) an abstract representation of the sensible object is provided for the intellectual possibility. Hence the characteristic of the idea, its non-materiality, and on this is based the principal argument for the spirituality and immortality of the soul. Here, too, is the foundation of logic and of the theory of knowledge, the justification of our judgments and syllogisms.\n\nUpon knowledge follows the appetitive process, sensory or intellectual according to the sort of knowledge. The will (\"appetitus intellectualis\") in certain conditions is free, and thanks to this liberty man is the master of his destiny. Like all other beings, we have an end to attain and we are morally obliged, though not compelled, to attain it.\n\nNatural happiness would result from the full development of our powers of knowing and loving. We should find and possess God in this world since the corporeal world is the proper object of our intelligence. But above nature is the order of grace and our supernatural happiness will consist in the direct intuition of God, the beatific vision. Here philosophy ends and theology begins.\n\nIn the period from the publication of Aeterni Patris in 1879 until the 1920s, neo-scholasticism gradually established itself as exclusive and all-pervading.\n\nOn October 15, 1879, Leo XIII created the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas, and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called \"Leonine Edition\", of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas. Moreover, Leo XIII increased Thomist studies in his support for the \"Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe\" (the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\"), by founding its Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of Canon Law in 1896.\n\nAccordingly, the thought of Thomas Aquinas came to be assessed positively in relation to all other ‘modern’ systems of thought. In particular, the Aristotelianism of Thomas was seen in contrast to the thought of Kant (itself seen as representative of ‘modern’ thought). Other ‘modern’ forms of thought, including Ontologism, Traditionalism, the dualism of Anton Günther, and the thought of Descartes, were also seen as flawed in comparison to Thomism.\n\nThe movement also spread into other countries. It found supporters in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Switzerland, France, Hungary, the United States, Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. In Belgium, a particularly important moment was the establishment by Leo XIII at Louvain (then still a francophone university) in 1891 of the \"Institut de philosophie\" for the special purpose of teaching the doctrine of St. Thomas together with history and the natural sciences. It was endorsed by four Catholic Congresses: Paris (1891); Brussels (1895); Freiburg (1897); Munich (1900).\n\nIn the early 20th century, neo-Thomism became official Catholic doctrine, and became increasingly defined in opposition to Modernism. In July 1907, Pope Pius X issued the decree \"Lamentabili sane exitu\", which condemned 65 Modernist propositions. Two months later, he issued the encyclical \"Pascendi Dominici Gregis\", in which he unequivocally condemned the agnosticism, immanentism, and relativism of Modernism as the 'synthesis of all heresies'. The anti-Modernist oath of 1910 was very important; this remained in force until 1966. . In 1914, Pope Pius X acted against Modernism by ordering, though the Sacred Congregation of Studies, the publication of a list of 24 philosophical propositions, propositions summarising the central tenets of neo-scholasticism to be taught in all colleges as fundamental elements of philosophy, which was intended to promote a purer form of Thomism; in 1916, these 24 propositions were confirmed as normative. In 1917, the Church’s new Code of Canon Law (\"Codex Iuris Canonici\") insisted that the doctrine, methods, and principles of Thomas should be used in teaching philosophy and theology. Thomist thought therefore became reflected in the manuals and textbooks widely in use in Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries before Vatican II.\n\nWhile writers such as Edouard Hugon, Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange, and Henri Grenier were maintaining the tradition of the manuals this did not mean that there was no variation or disagreement among thinkers about how best to formulate Thomism, especially in response to contemporary trends. Variation within the tradition of neo-scholastic Thomism is represented by Martin Grabmann (1875–1949), Amato Masnovo (1880–1955), Francesco Olgiati (1886–1962), and Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges (1863–1948). Authors such as Étienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Joseph Maréchal investigated alternative interpretations of Aquinas from the 1920s until the 1950s. Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking Catholic philosophers.\n\nThe growth in historical investigation into Thomas’s thought led some to believe that neo-Thomism did not always reflect the thought of Thomas Aquinas himself. This historically oriented theology was particularly carried out by writers such as Étienne Gilson, Marie-Dominique Chenu, and Henri de Lubac. At Vatican II, traditional neo-Thomist thought was opposed by such exponents of the \"nouvelle théologie\".\n\nMany Thomists however continue in the neo-scholastic tradition. Some relatively recent proponents are treated in Battista Mondin's \"Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti\" (2002), which treats Carlo Giacon (1900–1984), Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908–1990), Cornelio Fabro (1911–1995), Carlo Giacon (1900–1984), Tomas Tyn (1950–1990), Abelardo Lobato (1925–2012), Leo Elders (1926–), and Enrico Berti (1935–), among others. Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, neo-scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called \"strict observance Thomism.\"\n\nAlso Edward Feser in discussing anglophone authors has indicated that proponents of the more traditional Thomist perspective such as Ralph McInerny foster the possibility of a contemporary revival of neo-scholastic Thomism. Feser could be included along with these thinkers and other such as Brian Davies as engaging in a contemporary polemic in defense of the traditional system of Thomistic metaphysics in response to modern philosophy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36506774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36506774", "title": "Parable of the Sunfish", "text": "Parable of the Sunfish\n\n\"The Parable of the Sunfish\" is an anecdote with which Ezra Pound opens \"ABC of Reading\", a 1934 work of literary criticism. Pound uses this anecdote to emphasize an empirical approach for learning about art, in contrast to relying on commentary rooted in abstraction. While the parable is based on students' recollections of Louis Agassiz's teaching style, Pound's retelling diverges from these sources in several respects. The parable has been used to illustrate the benefits of scientific thinking, but more recent literary criticism has split on whether the parable accurately reflects the scientific process and calls into question Pound's empirical approach to literature.\n\nThe text of the parable below is excerpted from Pound's \"ABC of Reading\".\n<poem>\nA post-graduate student equipped with honors and diplomas went to Agassiz to receive the final and finishing touches. The great man offered him a small fish and told him to describe it.\n\nPost-Graduate Student: \"That's only a sunfish.\"\n\nAgassiz: \"I know that. Write a description of it.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes the student returned with the description of the \"Ichthus Heliodiplodokus\", or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from vulgar knowledge, family of \"Heliichtherinkus\", etc., as found in textbooks of the subject.\n\nAgassiz again told the student to describe the fish.\n\nThe student produced a four-page essay. Agassiz then told him to look at the fish. At the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it.⁠\n</poem>\n\nPound opens \"ABC of Reading\" with the following pronouncement:\nThe proper METHOD for studying poetry and good letters is the method of contemporary biologists, that is careful first-hand examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another. No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.\n\nIn the parable, a graduate student is sent to noted biologist Louis Agassiz to complete his education, and Agassiz asks the student three times to describe a sunfish specimen. The student replies with, in turn, the common name of the fish, a brief summary of the species, and a four-page essay on the species. Agassiz finally tells the student to \"look at the fish\" and \"[a]t the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it.\" The text of the parable itself spans 131 words over sixteen lines and is often reproduced in full when cited.\n\nPound contrasts this empiricism against knowledge gained through increasingly abstract definitions. As an example, Pound relates what might happen if a European is asked to define \"red\". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it described in terms of vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power. Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once \"Bacon had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after Galileo and others had stopped discussing things so much, and had begun really to look at them\". Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and Stravinsky. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge.\n\nPound subsequently refers to the parable in two essays: \"The Teacher's Mission\" and \"Mr Housman at Little Bethel\". Both were republished in \"The Literary Essays of Ezra Pound\" and reference Agassiz without including details of the parable. \"The Teacher's Mission\" in particular provides a straightforward explanation of how Pound wished the parable to be interpreted.\n\nIn January 1934, Pound published a critique of A. E. Housman's \"The Name and Nature of Poetry\" in the \"Criterion\". As part of the critique, Pound offers an emendation to Housman's claim that \"the intelligence\" of the eighteenth century involved \"some repressing and silencing of poetry\". Pound replies that the root cause was the tendency towards abstract statements, which came about in part because eighteenth century authors \"hadn't heard about Professor Agassiz's fish.\"\n\nAlso in 1934, Pound published an essay critiquing existing methods for teaching literature in general and university-level instruction methods in particular. He identifies the root of the problem as abstraction and uses the word \"liberty\" as an example of a term where a specific, concrete meaning has been lost. Pound finds this situation \"inexcusable AFTER the era of 'Agassiz and the fish'\" and demands an approach to general education that \"parallels ... biological study based on EXAMINATION and COMPARISON of particular specimens.\"\n\nLouis Agassiz was a Swiss-born scientist at Harvard University who, by 1896, had established a reputation for \"lock[ing] a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let[ting] him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained.\" Several students of Agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage, including Henry Blake, David Starr Jordan, Addison Emery Verrill, and Burt Green Wilder. American literary critic Robert Scholes traces the parable's source to two narratives in particular: those of former students Nathaniel Southgate Shaler and Samuel Hubbard Scudder. Their anecdotes were reprinted in Lane Cooper's \"Louis Agassiz as a Teacher: Illustrative Extracts on his Method of Instruction\". Their separate accounts differ markedly from Pound's: both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources.\n\nNathaniel Shaler left his humanist studies and joined Agassiz's lab at Harvard University, having already read Agassiz's introductory essay on classification. His autobiography details his initial interactions with Agassiz. With regard to his first assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied that he could not be more explicit than saying \"[f]ind out what you can without damaging the specimen\". After the first hours, Shaler thought he had \"compassed that fish,\" but despite Agassiz always being \"within call\" he was not asked to present his conclusions. During the course of the following week, Shaler recorded the details of \"how the scales went in series, their shape, the form and placement of the teeth, etc.\"\n\nAt length on the seventh day, came the question \"Well?\" and my disgorge of learning to him as he sat on the edge of my table puffing his cigar. At the end of the hour's telling, he swung off and away, saying \"That is not right.\"\n\nShaler concluded Agassiz was testing him to see if he was capable of \"doing hard, continuous work without the support of a teacher\" and redoubled his efforts, starting from scratch and, over the course of seven ten-hour days, managed to describe the specimen to Agassiz's satisfaction.\n\nSamuel Hubbard Scudder recorded a similar experience, first published in 1874 as \"Look at Your Fish\" in \"Every Saturday\" magazine. Agassiz again starts his new student off with a fish preserved in alcohol and instructs the student to \"look at it\", and promises \"by and by I will ask what you have seen\". As opposed to Pound's decomposing sunfish, Scudder's account emphasizes the care taken to keep the specimen in good condition:\nI was to keep the fish before me in a tin tray, and occasionally moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar ... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.\nScudder provides the additional detail that \"instruments of all kinds were interdicted\", including any magnifying glass. After several hours Agassiz asks for a report and Scudder describes \"the fringed gill-arches and moveable operculum; the pores of the head, fleshy lips and lidless eyes; the lateral line, the spinous fins and forked tail; the compressed and arched body\". Disappointed, Agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe \"the most conspicuous features of the animal\" and commands him to \"look again, look again!\" The mortified Scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen, and is able to report to Agassiz the following morning that \"the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs\", which was the observation Agassiz was looking for. However, when Scudder then asked what he should do next, Agassiz replied, \"Oh, look at your fish!\" which Scudder did for another two full days.\n\nIn 1917, English professor Lane Cooper from Cornell University published a collection of reminiscences of Agassiz. The book included notes from several notable contributors, including Scudder and Cooper, William James, Professor Addison Emery Verrill (\"[Agassiz's] plan was to make young students depend on natural objects rather than on statements in books\"), and Professor Edward S. Morse, who wrote that Agassiz's method was \"simply to let the student study intimately one object at a time.\" Cooper prefigures Pound's interest by remarking on the \"close, though not obvious, relation between investigation in biology or zoology and the observation and comparison of these organic forms which we call form of literature and works of art\", concluding that \"We study a poem, the work of man's art, in the same way that Agassiz made Shaler study a fish.\" Critic Robert Scholes concludes that Pound had access to this book and used the material within it as the source for the parable that opens \"ABC of Reading\".\n\nScience historian Mary P. Winsor provides extensive commentary on Agassiz's initial assignments for his students. The solution to the \"riddle\", as she calls it, lies in a similar anecdote given by Agassiz in his \"Essay on Classification\":Suppose that the innumerable articulated animals, which are counted by tens of thousands, nay, perhaps by hundreds of thousands, had never made their appearance upon the surface of the globe, with one single exception: that, for instance, our Lobster (\"Homarus americanus\") were the only representative of that extraordinarily diversified type,—how should we introduce that species of animals in our systems?\nAgassiz provides several potential solutions: the species of lobster could have a single genus \"by the side of all the other classes with their orders, families, etc.\", or a family with one genus and one species, or a class with one order and one genus, etc. Agassiz concludes a single species is sufficient to derive the entirety of the hierarchy: at the time, this would have been \"a distinct genus, a distinct family, a distinct class, a distinct branch.\" The point of the sunfish is not observing characteristics that distinguish individuals, species and genus, but rather characteristics that are held in common higher up the taxonomic hierarchy. Scudder's observation that finally satisfies Agassiz is that the sunfish has bilateral, paired organs; a characteristic that Winsor notes is common to all vertebrates.\n\nPound, echoing Cooper, opens \"ABC of Reading\" by stating that the correct method for the study of poetry is \"the method of contemporary biologists\" and that \"No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish.\" Commentators have summarized Pound's position with the term \"empiricism\", but have divided over whether the parable endorses or indicts the idea.\n\nThe simplest interpretations in scientific writing, history of science, and literary criticism take the parable at face value, accepting empiricism and observation as legitimate techniques. For example, when writing about stellar atmospheres, Dimitri Mihalas states that \"it is \"specimens\", not facts, that are the ultimate empirical currency that we must use if we wish to purchase a valid theory\" before beginning a discussion of Pound's sunfish.\n\nMoving from acceptance of empiricism to an understanding of its limitations, Christopher Tilley emphasizes in his comments on \"scientific archeology\" that Pound's student \"was not simply learning about 'reality', the sunfish, but a way of approaching that reality – a discourse bound up in a particular thought tradition (empiricism)\". Robert Scholes reaches a similar conclusion, noting that the student \"seems to be reporting about a real and solid world in a perfectly transparent language, but actually he is learning how to produce a specific kind of discourse, controlled by a particular scientific paradigm\".\n\nAuthor Bob Perelman takes the suspicion of empiricism one step further in his 1994 \"The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky\". Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in \"ABC of Reading\" that frame Pound's discussion of Chinese ideograms. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of Debussy and another of Ravel. Pound states that a person who attended both concerts knows more about the composers than someone who has only read \"ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both\". Perelman considers the contradiction between \"everyone\" and \"knowledge\" to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest can only make do with \"a fog of clichés, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness.\" With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of \"scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies\" where any mediating written descriptions (\"sunfish\", \"diplodokus\") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and \"[w]hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism.\"\n\nTwo critics have also commented on the parable's implications in describing the nature of knowledge in terms of the decay of Pound's fish. Celeste Goodridge notes that Marianne Moore's 1934 review of Pound's \"Cantos\" uses a detailed metaphor of a grasshopper wing to describe the conversations therein. In Goodridge's opinion, Moore's \"microscopic examination\" both undercuts the work as well as \"pays homage, in its precision, to Pound's reverence for 'the applicability of scientific method to literary criticism.'\" Goodridge then reproduces the parable in full and comments, \"Agassiz teaches Pound that all knowledge is necessarily fragmented and does not constitute a whole.\" Knowledge of the fish cannot begin until decay has commenced, reducing the specimen to its constituent parts.\n\nPeter Nicholas Baker reaches a fundamentally different conclusion. He begins the discussion of the parable by first quoting Pound on the topic of genius:\n\n\"The genius can pay in nugget and in lump gold; it is not necessary that he bring up his knowledge into the mint of consciousness, stamp it either into the coin of conscientiously analyzed form-detail knowledge or into the paper money of words before he transmit it.\"\n\nBaker finds the most striking feature of the parable to be the absence of description of the fish. Baker asks: \"Do readers of this anecdote learn about the fish, or rather about a certain kind of authoritarian teaching practice?\" Baker claims that Pound's images of coining metal are just as unrealistic as his ideas regarding science and the scientific method. The reader, following Pound's student, reaches knowledge through intuition alone; the decomposing fish, so far as epistemology is concerned, has become \"transparent\".\n"}

He was enthroned at the age of 18 months as the 12th Tai Situ by Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa. At the age of 5 he was brought to Tsurphu Monastery. At the age of six he left Tibet for Bhutan, where King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck had been a disciple of the 11th Tai Situ. Later he was cared for at Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, India, where he received his formal religious training from the 16th Karmapa.\n\nThe 16th Karmapa had been raised under the guidance of the 11th Tai Situ. The teacher-disciple relationship has served as a mechanism for the unbroken continuity within the Kagyu school. Chögyam Trungpa wrote in his book Born in Tibet: “Tai Situ Rinpoche, who was second in importance in the Karma Kagyu school, had died some years before and no reincarnation had been found. The Karmapa could now tell them where the incarnation had taken place. Everyone rejoiced and started immediately to make the preparations.\"\n\nIn 1974, at the age of 21, Pema Tönyö Nyinje went to Ladakh at the invitation from Druppon Dechen and stayed there for one year. In 1975, at the age of 22, he assumed his traditional responsibilities by founding Palpung Sherabling Monastery as his main seat in exile. In 2000, relics of the 8th Tai Situ were enthroned in a separate temple.\n\nAs a Buddhist teacher, the 12th Tai Situ traveled widely, making his first visit to the West in 1981 to Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre in Scotland and visiting the United States in 1982. Since then, he has extensively traveled throughout North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. His teachings have since been published in nine English books. Further publications followed in the new millennium.\n\nIn 1989 Pema Tönyö Nyinje embarked on the Pilgrimage for Active Peace. Its 25 years' jubilee was celebrated in a two-day Peace Conclave that was held in Palpung Sherabling Monastery with guests and representatives from different World Religions.\n\nTogether with the 12th Goshir Gyaltshap Pema Tönyö Nyinje recognised Orgyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa. He also recognized Choseng Trungpa, born on 6 February 1989 in Kham, as the reincarnation of Chögyam Trungpa.\n\nOn February 21, 2015, the Tai Situ opened Palpung Sherabling Monastery's newly built shedra, the Buddhist University for Higher Studies, Palpung Lungrig Jampal Ling, in a celebration. On May 11 and 12, 2015, the 14th Dalai Lama visited Palpung Sherabling Monastery in the presence of Jamgon Kongtrul, Khenchen Thrangu and representatives of all the Karma Kagyu monasteries in India, Nepal and Bhutan as well as representatives of the Sakya Trizin, Drikung Kyabgon, and Gyaltshab, in order to crown the completion of Palpung Sherabling Monastery, having exactly the same departments and facilities as Palpung Monastery in Tibet Autonomous Region with the Ten Knowledges, a monastery with its monastic community, a Buddhist university, three year retreats for both nuns and monks of the Marpa Kagyu and a Shangpa Kagyu retreat, as well as a reliquary temple with a two-day teaching that was preceded by a long-life empowerment granted by Tai Situpa.\n\n\n\n"}

He went to school at Christ's Hospital, Horsham, West Sussex. He earned his B.A. in Mathematics/History and Philosophy of Science from Christ's College, Cambridge in 1969, and his PhD in History and Philosophy of Science from Princeton University in 1974, where he worked closely with Carl Hempel and Thomas Kuhn.\n\nHe is married to Patricia Kitcher. She is a well known Kant scholar and philosopher of mind who has been the Mark Van Doren Professor of Humanities at Columbia.\n\nKitcher is best known outside academia for his work examining creationism and sociobiology. His works attempt to connect the questions raised in philosophy of biology and philosophy of mathematics with the central philosophical issues of epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. He has also published papers on John Stuart Mill, Kant and other figures in the history of philosophy. His 2012 book documented his developing interest in John Dewey and a pragmatic approach to philosophical issues. He sees pragmatism as providing a unifying and reconstructive approach to traditional philosophy issues. He had, a year earlier, published a book outlining a naturalistic approach to ethics, \"The Ethical Project\" (Harvard University Press, 2011). He has also done work on the philosophy of climate change.\n\nKitcher's three criteria for good science are:\n\nHe increasingly recognised the role of values in practical decisions about scientific research\n\nKitcher is the author of \"Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism\". He has commented on the way creationists have misinterpreted Kuhn:\n\nThomas Kuhn's book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" has probably been more widely read—and more widely misinterpreted—than any other book in the recent philosophy of science. The broad circulation of his views has generated a popular caricature of Kuhn's position. According to this popular caricature, scientists working in a field belong to a club. All club members are required to agree on main points of doctrine. Indeed, the price of admission is several years of graduate education, during which the chief dogmas are inculcated. The views of outsiders are ignored. Now I want to emphasize that this is a hopeless caricature, both of the practice of scientists and of Kuhn's analysis of the practice. Nevertheless, the caricature has become commonly accepted as a faithful representation, thereby lending support to the Creationists' claims that their views are arrogantly disregarded.\n\nKitcher currently teaches at Columbia University in the Department of Philosophy where he holds an appointment as the John Dewey Professor of Philosophy. As chair of Columbia's Contemporary Civilization program (part of its undergraduate Core Curriculum), he also holds the James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization. Before moving to Columbia, Kitcher taught at the University of Vermont, Vassar College, The University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, and for several years at University of California, San Diego where he held the position of Presidential Professor of Philosophy.\n\nKitcher is past president of the American Philosophical Association. In 2002, Kitcher was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he was awarded the inaugural Prometheus Prize from the American Philosophical Association in 2006 in honour of extended achievement in the philosophy of science.\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018.\n\nHe has trained a number of philosophers of science, including prominent Peter Godfrey-Smith at the City University of New York Graduate Center, Kyle Stanford at the University of California at Irvine, Michael R.

{"id": "317332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317332", "title": "Shen Dao", "text": "Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao (; c. 350c. 275BC) was a \"Chinese Legalist\" theoretician most remembered for his influence on Han Fei with regards to the concept of shi 勢 (circumstantial advantage, power, or authority), though most of his book concerns the concept of fa 法 (administrative methods & standards) more commonly shared among \"Legalists\". Compared with western schools, Shen Dao considered laws that are not good \"still preferable to having no laws at all.\"\n\nMaking use of the term dao without cosmological or metaphysical reference, the Shenzi serves as noteworthy precursor to both Taoist and Han Fei. Posthumously, he is also sometimes classified as Taoist, and Wang Fuzhi speculated that the chapter \"Essay on Seeing Things as Equal\" of the Zhuangzhi was actually written by Shen Dao. Compared with the egoist Yang Chu, Shen Dao is characterized by the Zhuangzhi as impartial and lacking selfishness, his great way embracing all things.\n\nUsually referred to as \"Master Shen\" (\"Shenzi\" 慎子) for his writings, very little is known of Shen Dao's life. An itinerant Chinese philosopher from Zhao, he was probably born about 350BC, travelling to the city of Linzi (modern Zibo, Shandong) in 300BC to become a member of the Jixia Academy. Shen probably left Linzi after its capture by the state of Yan in 285BC, possibly moving to the Han kingdom and absorbing the \"Legalist\" tradition there. He died roughly 10 years later.\n\nThompson states that the Shenzi was available until the fall of the Tang dynasty, though not in its original edition. Shen Dao's own original 42 essays have been lost. With only 7 fragments still extant, he is known largely through short references and the writings of others, notably the \"Han Feizi\" and \"Zhuangzi\". A critical reconstruction of the lost book of Shenzi was made by Paul Thompson, and published in 1979 as \"The Shen Tzu Fragments\". In 2007, the Shanghai Museum published a collection of texts written on bamboo slips from the State of Chu dating to the Warring States period, including six bamboo slips with sayings of Shenzi. These are the only known examples of the text of Shenzi that are contemporaneous with its composition.\n\nXun Kuang considered Shen's style grandiose.\n\nShen Dao espouses an impersonal administration in much the same sense as \"Legalist\" Shen Buhai, and in contrast with \"Legalist\" Shang Yang] emphasizes the use of talent and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are \"not the product of one man's efforts.\" He also argued for Wu wei, or the non action of the ruler, along the same lines as Shen Buhai, saying\nHowever he challenges the Confucian and Mohist esteem and appointment of worthies as a basis of order, pointing out that talented ministers existed in every age. Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue. Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, later used by the \"Guanzi\" and \"Xunzi\", to Shen, given a \"dimensional\" difference through Fa (measurement, standards, protocol, administrative method), social relationships (\"yin\") and division. Shen Dao eschews Shen Buhai's administrative method (of appraisal and appointment) in favour of a mechanical distribution (\"the basis of fairness\") with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement. \n\nThe greatest function of Fa (\"the principle of objective judgement\") is the prevention of selfish deeds and argument. However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian Li's supplementation of Fa and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules. \n\nFor this reason he is said to \"laugh at men of worth\" and \"reject sages\", his order relying not on them but on the Fa.\n\nLinking Fa to the notion of impartial objectivity associated with universal interest, and reframing the language of the old ritual order to fit a universal, imperial and highly bureaucratized state, Shen cautions the ruler against relying on his own personal judgment, contrasting personal opinions with the merit of the objective standard, or fa, as preventing personal judgements or opinions from being exercised. Personal opinions destroy Fa, and Shen Dao's ruler therefore \"does not show favoritism toward a single person.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, \"Chinese Legalism\" understood that the power of the state resides in social and political institutions, and are innovative in their aim to subject the state to them. Like Shen Buhai, Shen Dao largely focused on statecraft (Fa), and Confucian Xun Kuang discusses him in this capacity, never referencing Shen Dao in relation to power. Shen Dao is remembered for his theories on Shih (lit. \"situational advantage\", but also \"power\" or \"charisma\") because Han Fei references him in this capacity. \n\nHan Fei says: \nUsed in many areas of Chinese thought, Shih probably originated in the military field. Diplomats relied on concepts of situational advantage and opportunity, as well as secrecy (shu) long before the ascendency of such concepts as sovereignty or law, and were used by kings wishing to free themselves from the aristocrats. Sunzi (Art of War) would go on to incorporate Taoist philosophy of inaction and impartiality, and Legalist punishment and rewards as systematic measures of organization, recalling Han Fei's concepts of power (shih) and tactics (shu).\n\nOn the Shih of the Sunzi, relatable to Shen Dao's, Henry Kissinger says: \"Chinese statesmanship exhibits a tendency to view the entire strategic landscape as part of a single whole… Strategy and statecraft become means of 'combative coexistence' with opponents. The goal is to maneuver them into weaness while building up one's own shi, or strategic position.\" Kissinger considers the \"maneuvering\" approach an ideal, but one that ran in contrast to the conlicts of the Qin dynasty.\n\nSearching out the causes of disorder, Shen Dao observed splits in the ruler's authority. Shen Dao's theory on power echoes Shen Buhai, referenced by Xun Kuang as its originator, who says \"He who (can become) singular decision-maker can become the sovereign of All under Heaven\". Shen Dao's theory may otherwise have been borrowed from the \"Book of Lord Shang\". \n\nFor Shen Dao, \"Power\" (Shih) refers to the ability to compel compliance; it requires no support from the subjects, though it does not preclude this. (Shih's) merit is that it prevents people from fighting each other; political authority is justified and essential on this basis. Shen Dao says: \"When All under Heaven lacks the single esteemed [person], then there is no way to carry out the principles [of orderly government, li 理]…. Hence the Son of Heaven is established for the sake of All under Heaven… All under Heaven is not established for the sake of the Son of Heaven…\"\n\nTalent cannot be displayed without power. Shen Dao says: \"The flying dragon rides on the clouds and the rising serpent wanders in the mists. But when the clouds disperse and the mists clear up, the dragon and the serpent become the same as the earthworm and the large winged black ant because they have lost what they ride.\" Leadership is not a function of ability or merit, but is given by some a process, such as giving a leader to a group. \"The ruler of a state is enthroned for the sake of the state; the state is not established for the sake of the prince. Officials are installed for the sake of their offices; offices are not established for the sake of officials…\n\nUsually disregarded by the Fa-Jia, Shen Dao considers moral capability useful in terms of authority. If the ruler is inferior but his command is practised, it is because he is able to get support from people. But his ideas otherwise constitute a \"direct challenge\" to Confucian Virtue. Virtue is unreliable because people have different capacities. Both morality together with intellectual capability are insufficient to rule, while position of authority is enough to attain influence and subdue the worthy, making virtue \"not worth going after.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1291485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1291485", "title": "Situational ethics", "text": "Situational ethics\n\nSituational ethics or situation ethics takes into account the particular context of an act when evaluating it ethically, rather than judging it according to absolute moral standards. With the intent to have a fair basis for judgments or action, one looks to personal ideals of what is appropriate to guide them, rather than an unchanging universal code of conduct, such as Biblical law under divine command theory or the Kantian categorical imperative. Proponents of situational approaches to ethics include existentialist philosophers Sartre, de Beauvoir, Jaspers, and Heidegger.\n\nSpecifically Christian forms of situational ethics placing love above all particular principles or rules were proposed in the first half of the twentieth century by liberal theologians Rudolf Bultmann, John A. T. Robinson, and Joseph Fletcher. These theologians point specifically to \"agapē\", or unconditional love, as the highest end. Other theologians who advocated situational ethics include Josef Fuchs, Reinhold Niebuhr, Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Paul Tillich. Tillich, for example, declared that \"Love is the ultimate law.\"\n\nFletcher, who became prominently associated with this approach in the English-speaking world due to his book (\"Situation Ethics\"), stated that \"all laws and rules and principles and ideals and norms, are only contingent, only valid if they happen to serve love\" in the particular situation, and thus may be broken or ignored if another course of action would achieve a more loving outcome. Fletcher has sometimes been identified as the founder of situation ethics, but he himself refers his readers to the active debate over the theme that preceded his own work.\n\nSituational ethics is a form of consequentialism (though distinct from utilitarianism in that the latter's aim is \"the greatest good for the greatest number\") that focuses on creating the greatest amount of love. Situational ethics can also be classed under the ethical theory genre of \"proportionalism\" which says that \"It is never right to go against a principle unless there is a proportionate reason which would justify it.\" J. A. T. Robinson, a situational ethicist, considered the approach to be a form of ethical relativism.\n\nThere was an active debate in the mid-twentieth century around situational ethics, which was being promoted by a number of primarily Protestant theologians. The English term \"situation ethics\" was taken from the German \"Situationsethik\". It is unclear who first coined the term either in German or in its English variant.\n\nFletcher proposed that in forming an ethical system based on love, he was best expressing the notion of \"love thy neighbor,\" which Jesus Christ taught in the Gospels of the New Testament of the Bible. Through situational ethics, Fletcher was attempting to find a \"middle road\" between legalistic and antinomian ethics. Fletcher developed his theory of situational ethics in his books: \"The Classic Treatment\" and \"Situation Ethics\". Situational ethics is thus a teleological or consequential theory, in that it is primarily concerned with the outcome or consequences of an action; the \"end\". Fletcher proposed that loving ends justify any means.\n\nFletcher outlined his theory in four \"working principles\" and six \"fundamental principles\".\n\nThe following are presuppositions Fletcher makes before setting out the situational ethics theory:\n\n\n\nFletcher proposed various examples of situations in which the established moral laws might need to be put on hold in order to achieve the greater amount of love. These were based upon real situations.\n\nPragmatism, positivism, relativism and personalism are the four working principles which mean to be reasonably sure the act you take will work and provide the most loving consequence, accepting Situational Ethics as a matter of faith and not reason, each situation must be relative to love and bring about the most loving result and finally the needs of people come first rather than a set of rules.\n\nThese situations were criticised as being extreme. Joseph Fletcher agreed that they were, as general guidelines should apply in normal cases, with exceptions for extreme cases.\n\n\n"}

The show would run on the pay-TV channel Showtime (Trilogy, a Los Angeles- and Canada-based company, is credited with creating the 1995 series).\n\nThe episodes appeared in syndication the following season (the same arrangement as MGM/Showtime series \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"\"). It continued on Showtime until 2001, when Sci Fi quietly took over production for the seventh and final series. As a result, that series, unlike the previous ones, was completely free of any swearing or nudity. It was canceled in 2002, after a total of 154 episodes—far more than the original incarnation of the show. In the revived show, the Control Voice was supplied by Kevin Conway. The new series distanced itself from the \"monster of the week\" mandate that had characterized the original series from its inception; while there were plenty of aliens and monsters, they dramatize a specific scientific concept and its effect on humanity. Examples of this include \"Dark Rain\" (biochemical warfare causing worldwide sterility), \"Final Exam\" (discovery of practical cold fusion power), \"A Stitch in Time\" (a time traveler tinkers with history), as well as two episodes revolving around a human mutation known as Genetic Rejection Syndrome (humans mutating into violent creatures) as a result of an outlawed eugenics attempt to create superior children.\n\nThe series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Stories by Harlan Ellison, A. E. van Vogt, Eando Binder, Larry Niven, Richard Matheson, George R.R. Martin, Stephen King, and James Patrick Kelly were adapted.\n\nLeslie Stevens was a program consultant for the first four seasons (until his death), while Joseph Stefano served as an executive consultant and later senior advisor throughout the whole series. Stefano also remade his episode \"A Feasibility Study\", retitling it \"Feasibility Study\" for the third season. Mark Mancina and John Van Tongeren composed new music different from that of Dominic Frontiere and Harry Lubin. They scored ten episodes for the first season. The musical theme for the modern \"Outer Limits\" series is credited to Mark Mancina and John VanTongeren. However, the same music is used in \"The Ambush\", a theme in the soundtrack of \"Dune 2000\".\n\nIn most seasons there was a clip show that intertwines the plots of several of the show's episodes (see \"The Voice of Reason\" for an example). At each commercial interval, the Control Voice can be heard saying \"The Outer Limits...please stand by\". The voice repeats this phrase upon return from the television ads. The surreal images from the opening are mostly the work of Jerry Uelsmann.\n\nA number of episodes from seasons 1–6 feature nudity and adult content; though originally broadcast uncensored, those episodes have been edited for commercial syndication.\n\nBetween 1997 and 1999, a series of books based on the show aimed towards younger readers was published by Tor Books, with author John Peel penning them. The first book, \"The Zanti Misfits\", was a loose adaptation of the episode of the same name from the 1963 series, while others were based on other episodes.\n\n\nSix themed DVD anthologies of \"The Outer Limits\", with six episodes each, were released by MGM in the US: \"Aliens Among Us\", \"Death & Beyond\", \"Fantastic Androids & Robots\", \"Mutation & Transformation\", \"Sex & Science Fiction\" and \"Time Travel & Infinity\". These DVDs all contain the original uncut episodes, as originally aired. The \"Aliens\" and \"Sex\" titles were also released by MGM in the UK.\n\nSeason 1 was released uncut and with extra features on DVD in the US (MGM, 2005), UK (20th Century Fox, 2007) and Germany (Fox/MGM, 2008). Because sales of the set did not meet expectations no further seasons were released.\n\nIn 2010 Canada's Alliance Home Entertainment released all seven seasons on DVD. Season 1 mirrored the content of the earlier MGM set, while season 2 was also uncensored, with the exception of one episode, \"Paradise\". Seasons 3–6 all contain numerous censored episodes and are of noticeably poorer visual quality than the first two. Season 7 contains the original unedited episodes, as unlike the previous seasons, it was produced with no nudity or swearing.\n\nIn 2013 TGG Direct released the seventh season in the US, again unedited but of marginally inferior visual quality than the Alliance season 7 DVDs. The 5-disc set is titled \"The Outer Limits: The Complete Final Season\", and in 2014 it was split and re-released as 3-disc \"Volume One\" and 2-disc \"Volume Two\" sets.\n\nVisual Entertainment announced all seasons on DVD.\n\nThe Outer Limits revival currently has a rating of 7.8/10 on IMDB.\n\nIn 2014, it was reported that a feature film directed by Scott Derrickson based on the series was to be underway. However, no additional information has been released as of 2018.\n\nAll uncut seven seasons of the series are available on Hulu and Amazon Video.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18630637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18630637", "title": "Translation", "text": "Translation\n\nTranslation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. The English language draws a terminological distinction (not all languages do) between \"translating\" (a written text) and \"interpreting\" (oral or sign-language communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community.\n\nA translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language words, grammar, or syntax into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such \"spill-overs\" have sometimes imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. Translators, including early translators of sacred texts, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.\n\nBecause of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. More recently, the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated \"language localization\".\n\nThe English word \"translation\" derives from the Latin word \"translatio\", which comes from \"\", \"across\" + \"\", \"to carry\" or \"to bring\" (\"-latio\" in turn coming from \"latus\", the past participle of \"ferre\"). Thus \"translatio\" is \"a carrying across\" or \"a bringing across\": in this case, of a text from one language to another.\n\nThe Germanic languages (except for modern Dutch) and some Slavic languages have d their words for the concept of \"translation\" on \"translatio\".\n\nThe Romance languages and the remaining \"Slavic\" languages have derived their words for the concept of \"translation\" from an alternative Latin word, \"traductio\", itself derived from \"traducere\" (\"to lead across\" or \"to bring across\", from \"trans\", \"across\" + \"\", \"to lead\" or \"to bring\").\n\nThe Ancient Greek term for \"translation\", (\"metaphrasis\", \"a speaking across\"), has supplied English with \"metaphrase\" (a \"literal\", or \"word-for-word\", translation)—as contrasted with \"paraphrase\" (\"a saying in other words\", from , \"paraphrasis\"). \"Metaphrase\" corresponds, in one of the more recent terminologies, to \"formal equivalence\"; and \"paraphrase\", to \"dynamic equivalence\".\n\nStrictly speaking, the concept of metaphrase—of \"word-for-word translation\"—is an imperfect concept, because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning; and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word. Nevertheless, \"metaphrase\" and \"paraphrase\" may be useful as \"ideal\" concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation.\n\nDiscussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into antiquity and show remarkable continuities. The ancient Greeks distinguished between \"metaphrase\" (literal translation) and \"paraphrase\". This distinction was adopted by English poet and translator John Dryden (1631–1700), who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting, in the target language, \"counterparts,\" or equivalents, for the expressions used in the source language:\n\nDryden cautioned, however, against the license of \"imitation\", i.e., of adapted translation: \"When a painter copies from the life... he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments...\"\n\nThis general formulation of the central concept of translation—equivalence—is as adequate as any that has been proposed since Cicero and Horace, who, in 1st-century-BCE Rome, famously and literally cautioned against translating \"word for word\" ().\n\nDespite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual \"practice\" of translation has hardly changed since antiquity. Except for some extreme metaphrasers in the early Christian period and the Middle Ages, and adapters in various periods (especially pre-Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking equivalents—\"literal\" where possible, paraphrastic where necessary—for the original meaning and other crucial \"values\" (e.g., style, verse form, concordance with musical accompaniment or, in films, with speech articulatory movements) as determined from context.\nIn general, translators have sought to preserve the context itself by reproducing the original order of sememes, and hence word order—when necessary, reinterpreting the actual grammatical structure, for example, by shifting from active to passive voice, or \"vice versa\". The grammatical differences between \"fixed-word-order\" languages (e.g. English, French, German) and \"free-word-order\" languages (e.g., Greek, Latin, Polish, Russian) have been no impediment in this regard. The particular syntax (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language. \n\nWhen a target language has lacked terms that are found in a source language, translators have borrowed those terms, thereby enriching the target language. Thanks in great measure to the exchange of calques and loanwords between languages, and to their importation from other languages, there are few concepts that are \"untranslatable\" among the modern European languages. A greater problem, however, is translating terms relating to cultural concepts that have no equivalent in the target language. For full comprehension, such situations require the provision of a gloss.\n\nGenerally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of metaphrase to paraphrase that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in ecological niches of words, a common etymology is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English \"actual\" should not be confused with the cognate French (\"present\", \"current\"), the Polish (\"present\", \"current,\" \"topical\", \"timely\", \"feasible\"), the Swedish \"aktuell\" (\"topical\", \"presently of importance\"), the Russian (\"urgent\", \"topical\") or the Dutch \"actueel\" (\"current\").\n\nThe translator's role as a bridge for \"carrying across\" values between cultures has been discussed at least since Terence, the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an artist. The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as Cicero. Dryden observed that \"Translation is a type of drawing after life...\" Comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to Samuel Johnson's remark about Alexander Pope playing Homer on a flageolet, while Homer himself used a bassoon.\n\nIf translation be an art, it is no easy one. In the 13th century, Roger Bacon wrote that if a translation is to be true, the translator must know both languages, as well as the science that he is to translate; and finding that few translators did, he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether.\nThe translator of the Bible into German, Martin Luther (1483–1546), is credited with being the first European to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language. L.G. Kelly states that since Johann Gottfried Herder in the 18th century, \"it has been axiomatic\" that one translates only toward his own language.\n\nCompounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no dictionary or thesaurus can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating. The Scottish historian Alexander Tytler, in his \"Essay on the Principles of Translation\" (1790), emphasized that assiduous reading is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including listening to the \"spoken\" language, had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and grammarian Onufry Kopczyński.\n\nThe translator's special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by \"Poland's La Fontaine\", the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland, poet, encyclopedist, author of the first Polish novel, and translator from French and Greek, Ignacy Krasicki:\n\nDue to Western colonialism and cultural dominance in recent centuries, Western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions. The Western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions, and on more recent European innovations.\n\nThough earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-Western or pre-Western environments. Also, though heavily influenced by Western traditions and practiced by translators taught in Western-style educational systems, Chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the Chinese tradition.\n\nTraditions of translating material among the languages of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Assyria (Syriac language), Anatolia, and Israel (Hebrew language) go back several millennia. There exist partial translations of the Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" (c. 2000 BCE) into Southwest Asian languages of the second millennium BCE.\n\nAn early example of a bilingual document is the 1274 BCE Treaty of Kadesh between the ancient Egyptian and Hittie empires.\n\nThere is a separate tradition of translation in South, Southeast and East Asia (primarily of texts from the Indian and Chinese civilizations), connected especially with the rendering of religious, particularly Buddhist, texts and with the governance of the Chinese empire. Classical Indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation, rather than the closer translation more commonly found in Europe; and Chinese translation theory identifies various criteria and limitations in translation.\n\nIn the East Asian sphere of Chinese cultural influence, more important than translation \"per se\" has been the use and reading of Chinese texts, which also had substantial influence on the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, with substantial borrowings of Chinese vocabulary and writing system. Notable is the Japanese kanbun, a system for glossing Chinese texts for Japanese speakers.\n\nThough Indianized states in Southeast Asia often translated Sanskrit material into the local languages, the literate elites and scribes more commonly used Sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government.\n\nSome special aspects of translating from Chinese are illustrated in Perry Link's discussion of translating the work of the Tang Dynasty poet Wang Wei (699–759 CE).\n\nOnce the untranslatables have been set aside, the problems for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two: What does the translator think the poetic line says? And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the target language? Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, \"where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate.\" Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit dilemma. At the literalist extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about the language of the original Chinese poem. \"The dissection, though,\" writes Link, \"normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the scalpel of an anatomy instructor does to the life of a frog.\"\n\nChinese characters, in avoiding grammatical specificity, offer advantages to poets (and, simultaneously, challenges to poetry translators) that are associated primarily with absences of subject, number, and tense.\n\nIt is the norm in classical Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit subjects; the reader or listener infers a subject. Some Western languages, however, ask by grammatical rule that subjects always be stated. Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's \"19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei\" supply a subject. Weinberger points out, however, that when an \"I\" as a subject is inserted, a \"controlling individual mind of the poet\" enters and destroys the effect of the Chinese line. Without a subject, he writes, \"the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader.\" Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's passive voice; but this again particularizes the experience too much.\n\nNouns have no number in Chinese. \"If,\" writes Link, \"you want to talk in Chinese about one rose, you may, but then you use a \"measure word\" to say \"one blossom-of roseness.\"\n\nChinese verbs are tense-less: there are several ways to specify when something happened or will happen, but verb tense is not one of them. For poets, this creates the great advantage of ambiguity. According to Link, Weinberger's insight about subjectlessness—that it produces an effect \"both universal and immediate\"—applies to timelessness as well.\n\nLink proposes a kind of uncertainty principle that may be applicable not only to translation from the Chinese language, but to all translation:\n\nTranslation of material into Arabic expanded after the creation of Arabic script in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of Islam and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the Al-Karaouine (Fes, Morocco), Al-Azhar (Cairo, Egypt), and the Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.\n\nArabic translation efforts and techniques are important to Western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges. Especially after the Renaissance, Europeans began more intensive study of Arabic and Persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of Arab and oriental origins. Arabic and, to a lesser degree, Persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized Western traditions, which in time would overtake the Islamic and oriental traditions.\n\nIn the 19th century, after the Middle East's Islamic clerics and copyists\nA translator who contributed mightily to the advance of the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801–73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students. After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of Muhammad Ali (1769–1849), the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, al–Tahtawi became head of the new school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to Voltaire's biography of Peter the Great, along with the \"Marseillaise\" and the entire \"Code Napoléon\". This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since Abbasid times (750–1258).\n\nThe movement to translate English and European texts transformed the Arabic and Ottoman Turkish languages, and new words, simplified syntax, and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions. Educated Arabs and Turks in the new professions and the modernized civil service expressed skepticism, writes Christopher de Bellaigue, \"with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today... No longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools, interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness. It had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world.\" One of the neologisms that, in a way, came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was \"darwiniya\", or \"Darwinism\".\n\nOne of the most influential liberal Islamic thinkers of the time was Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905), Egypt's senior judicial authority—its chief mufti—at the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of Darwin who in 1903 visited Darwin's exponent Herbert Spencer at his home in Brighton. Spencer's view of society as an organism with its own laws of evolution paralleled Abduh's ideas.\n\nAfter World War I, when Britain and France divided up the Middle East's countries, apart from Turkey, between them, pursuant to the Sykes-Picot agreement—in violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar Arab autonomy—there came an immediate reaction: the Muslim Brotherhood emerged in Egypt, the House of Saud took over the Hijaz, and regimes led by army officers came to power in Iran and Turkey. \"[B]oth illiberal currents of the modern Middle East,\" writes de Bellaigue, \"Islamism and militarism, received a major impetus from Western empire-builders.\" As often happens in countries undergoing social crisis, the aspirations of the Muslim world's translators and modernizers, such as Muhammad Abduh, largely had to yield to retrograde currents.\n\nFidelity (or \"faithfulness\") and felicity (or transparency), dual ideals in translation, are often (though not always) at odds. A 17th-century French critic coined the phrase \"\" to suggest that translations, like women, can be either faithful or beautiful, but not both. Fidelity is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the source text, without distortion.Transparency is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language, and conforms to its grammar, syntax and idiom. John Dryden (1631–1700) wrote in his preface to the translation anthology \"Sylvae\":\nA translation that meets the criterion of fidelity (faithfulness) is said to be \"faithful\"; a translation that meets the criterion of transparency, \"idiomatic\". Depending on the given translation, the two qualities may not be mutually exclusive. The criteria for judging the fidelity of a translation vary according to the subject, type and use of the text, its literary qualities, its social or historical context, etc. The criteria for judging the transparency of a translation appear more straightforward: an unidiomatic translation \"sounds wrong\"; and, in the extreme case of word-for-word translations generated by many machine-translation systems, often results in patent nonsense.\nNevertheless, in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a literal translation. Translators of literary, religious, or historic texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text, stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text. Also, a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide \"local color\".\n\nWhile current Western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of \"fidelity\" and \"transparency\", this has not always been the case. There have been periods, especially in pre-Classical Rome and in the 18th century, when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of \"adaptation\". Adapted translation retains currency in some non-Western traditions. The Indian epic, the \"Ramayana\", appears in many versions in the various Indian languages, and the stories are different in each. Similar examples are to be found in medieval Christian literature, which adjusted the text to local customs and mores.\n\nMany non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from German Romanticism, the most obvious influence being the German theologian and philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher. In his seminal lecture \"On the Different Methods of Translation\" (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move \"the writer toward [the reader]\", i.e., transparency, and those that move the \"reader toward [the author]\", i.e., an extreme fidelity to the foreignness of the source text. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote German literature.\n\nIn recent decades, prominent advocates of such \"non-transparent\" translation have included the French scholar Antoine Berman, who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations, and the American theorist Lawrence Venuti, who has called on translators to apply \"foreignizing\" rather than domesticating translation strategies.\n\nThe question of fidelity vs. transparency has also been formulated in terms of, respectively, \"\"formal\" equivalence\" and \"\"dynamic\" [or \"functional\"] equivalence\" – expressions associated with the translator Eugene Nida and originally coined to describe ways of translating the \"Bible\"; but the two approaches are applicable to any translation. \"Formal equivalence\" corresponds to \"metaphrase\", and \"dynamic equivalence\" to \"paraphrase\". \"Formal equivalence\" (sought via \"literal\" translation) attempts to render the text literally, or \"word for word\" (the latter expression being itself a word-for-word rendering of the classical Latin ) – if necessary, at the expense of features natural to the target language. By contrast, \"dynamic equivalence\" (or \"\"functional\" equivalence\") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text—if necessary, at the expense of literality, original sememe and word order, the source text's active vs. passive voice, etc. \nThere is, however, no sharp boundary between formal and functional equivalence. On the contrary, they represent a spectrum of translation approaches. Each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator, and at various points within the same text – sometimes simultaneously. Competent translation entails the judicious blending of formal and functional equivalents.\n\nCommon pitfalls in translation, especially when practiced by inexperienced translators, involve false equivalents such as \"false friends\" and false cognates.\n\nA \"back-translation\" is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text, made without reference to the original text. \nComparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation. But the results of such reverse-translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable. Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because linguistic symbols (words) are often ambiguous, whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal. In the context of machine translation, a back-translation is also called a \"round-trip translation.\" When translations are produced of material used in medical clinical trials, such as informed-consent forms, a back-translation is often required by the ethics committee or institutional review board.\n\nMark Twain provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his short story, \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\". He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a \"Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story\". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick's \"Greek Prose Composition\" (p. 116) under the title, \"The Athenian and the Frog\"; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent ancient Greek precursor to Twain's \"Jumping Frog\" story.\n\nWhen a document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel \"The Saragossa Manuscript\" by the Polish aristocrat Jan Potocki (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by Edmund Chojecki in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete \"Saragossa Manuscript\" have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's Polish version.\n\nMany works by the influential Classical physician Galen survive only in medieval Arabic translation. Some survive only in Renaissance Latin translations from the Arabic, thus at a second remove from the original. To better understand Galen, scholars have attempted back-translation of such works in order to reconstruct the original Greek.\n\nWhen historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language, back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as idioms, puns, peculiar grammatical structures, etc., are in fact derived from the original language. For example, the known text of the \"Till Eulenspiegel\" folk tales is in High German but contains puns that work only when back-translated to Low German. This seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in Low German and translated into High German by an over-metaphrastic translator.\n\nSupporters of Aramaic primacy—of the view that the Christian New Testament or its sources were originally written in the Aramaic language—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing Greek text of the New Testament make much better sense when back-translated to Aramaic: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek. Due to similar indications, it is believed that the 2nd century Gnostic Gospel of Judas, which survives only in Coptic, was originally written in Greek.\n\nJohn Dryden (1631–1700), the dominant English-language literary figure of his age, illustrates, in his use of back-translation, translators' influence on the evolution of languages and literary styles. Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in prepositions because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions. Dryden created the proscription against \"preposition stranding\" in 1672 when he objected to Ben Jonson's 1611 phrase, \"the bodies that those souls were frighted from\", though he did not provide the rationale for his preference. Dryden often translated his writing into Latin, to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then he back-translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the controversial rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers.\n\nCompetent translators show the following attributes:\n\nA competent translator is not only bilingual but bicultural. A language is not merely a collection of words and of rules of grammar and syntax for generating sentences, but also a vast interconnecting system of connotations and cultural references whose mastery, writes linguist Mario Pei, \"comes close to being a lifetime job.\" The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator—after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures—may require a minimum of ten years' experience. Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them.\n\nThe translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist, e.g., a musician or actor, who interprets a work of art. Translation, like other human activities, entails making choices, and choice implies interpretation. Mark Polizzotti writes: \"A good translation offers not a reproduction of the work but an interpretation, a re-representation, just as the performance of a play or a sonata is a representation of the script or the score, one among many possible representations.\" \n\nThe English-language novelist Joseph Conrad, whose writings Zdzisław Najder has described as verging on \"auto-translation\" from Conrad's Polish and French linguistic personae, advised his niece and Polish translator Aniela Zagórska: \"[D]on't trouble to be too scrupulous... I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion \"il vaut mieux interpréter que traduire\" [it is better to interpret than to translate]... \"Il s'agit donc de trouver les équivalents. Et là, ma chère, je vous prie laissez vous guider plutôt par votre tempérament que par une conscience sévère...\" [It is, then, a question of finding the equivalent expressions. And there, my dear, I beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience...]\" Conrad advised another translator that the prime requisite for a good translation is that it be \"idiomatic\". \"For in the idiom is the \"clearness\" of a language and the language's force and its picturesqueness—by which last I mean the picture-producing power of arranged words.\" Conrad thought C.K. Scott Moncrieff's English translation of Marcel Proust's \"À la recherche du temps perdu\" (\"In Search of Lost Time\"—or, in Scott Moncrieff's rendering, \"Remembrance of Things Past\") to be preferable to the French original.\n\nThe necessity of making choices, and therefore of interpretation, in translating (and in other fields of human endeavor) stems from the ambiguity that subjectively pervades the universe. Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human language. Psychologist and neural scientist Gary Marcus notes that \"virtually every sentence [that people generate] is ambiguous, often in multiple ways. Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice.\" An example of linguistic ambiguity is the \"pronoun disambiguation problem\" (\"PDP\"): a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence—such as \"he\", \"she\" or \"it\"—refers. Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either.\n\nAmbiguity is a concern to both translators and, as the writings of poet and literary critic William Empson have demonstrated, to literary critics. Ambiguity may be desirable, indeed essential, in poetry and diplomacy; it can be more problematic in ordinary prose.\n\nA translator is faced with two contradictory tasks: when translating, he must strive for omniscience; when reviewing his translation, he must assume (the naive reader's) ignorance. \n\nA translator may render only parts of the original text, provided he indicates that this is what he is doing. But a translator should not assume the role of censor and surreptitiously delete or bowdlerize passages merely to please a political or moral interest.\n\nTranslating has served as a school of writing for many an author, much as the copying of masterworks of painting has schooled many a novice painter. A translator who can competently render an author's thoughts into the translator's own language, should certainly be able to adequately render, in his own language, any thoughts of his own. Translating (like analytic philosophy) compels precise analysis of language elements and of their usage. In 1946 the poet Ezra Pound, then at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, in Washington, D.C., advised a visitor, the 18-year-old beginning poet W.S. Merwin: \"The work of translation is the best teacher you'll ever have.\" Merwin, translator-poet who took Pound's advice to heart, writes of translation as an \"impossible, unfinishable\" art.\n\nTranslators, including monks who spread Buddhist texts in East Asia, and the early modern European translators of the Bible, in the course of their work have shaped the very languages into which they have translated. They have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between cultures; and along with ideas, they have imported from the source languages, into their own languages, loanwords and calques of grammatical structures, idioms, and vocabulary.\n\nInterpreting, or \"interpretation,\" is the facilitation of oral or sign-language communication, either simultaneously or consecutively, between two, or among three or more, speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language. The term \"interpreting,\" rather than \"interpretation,\" is preferentially used for this activity by Anglophone translators, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word \"interpretation.\" Unlike English, many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of written and live-communication (oral or sign-language) translators. Even English does not always make the distinction, frequently using \"translating\" as a synonym for \"interpreting.\"\n\nInterpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in history. A prime example is La Malinche, also known as \"Malintzin\", \"Malinalli\" and \"Doña Marina\", an early-16th-century Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast. As a child she had been sold or given to Maya slave-traders from Xicalango, and thus had become bilingual. Subsequently, given along with other women to the invading Spaniards, she became instrumental in the Spanish conquest of Mexico, acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to Hernán Cortés.\n\nNearly three centuries later, in the United States, a comparable role as interpreter was played for the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–6 by Sacagawea. As a child, the Lemhi Shoshone woman had been kidnapped by Hidatsa Indians and thus had become bilingual. Sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the North American continent to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSworn translation, also called \"certified translation,\" aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages. It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations. Some countries recognize declared competence. Others require the translator to be an official state appointee. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, translators must be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations.\n\nMany commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone. There is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing. The device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between English and 180 other languages.\n\nWeb-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations, human translation remains the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available. With the recent emergence of translation crowdsourcing, translation-memory techniques, and internet applications, translation agencies have been able to provide on-demand human-translation services to businesses, individuals, and enterprises.\n\nWhile not instantaneous like its machine counterparts such as Google Translate and Yahoo! Babel Fish, web-based human translation has been gaining popularity by providing relatively fast, accurate translation of business communications, legal documents, medical records, and software localization. Web-based human translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers. Contents of websites are translatable but urls of websites are not translatable into other languages. Language tools on the internet provide help in understanding text. (see reference link).\n\nComputer-assisted translation (CAT), also called \"computer-aided translation,\" \"machine-aided human translation\" (MAHT) and \"interactive translation,\" is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a target text with the assistance of a computer program. The machine supports a human translator.\n\nComputer-assisted translation can include standard dictionary and grammar software. The term, however, normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator, including translation-memory, terminology-management, concordance, and alignment programs.\n\nThese tools speed up and facilitate human translation, but they do not provide translation. The latter is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation.\n\nMachine translation (MT) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a source text and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, machine translation typically does involve human intervention, in the form of pre-editing and post-editing. With proper terminology work, with preparation of the source text for machine translation (pre-editing), and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a translation-memory or globalization-management system.\n\nUnedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the Internet such as Google Translate, Babel Fish, Babylon, and StarDict. These produce rough translations that, under favorable circumstances, \"give the gist\" of the source text. With the Internet, translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages. Whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility, however, since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context; translated pages tend to be more erroneously humorous and confusing than enlightening.\n\nInteractive translations with pop-up windows are becoming more popular. These tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase. Human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text. Possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation. Also, companies such as Ectaco produce pocket devices that provide machine translations.\n\nRelying exclusively on unedited machine translation, however, ignores the fact that communication in human language is context-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human. Claude Piron writes that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text, which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved. Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be meaningless.\n\nThe weaknesses of pure machine translation, unaided by human expertise, are those of artificial intelligence itself. Translator Mark Polizzotti holds that machine translation, by Google Translate and the like, is unlikely to threaten human translators anytime soon, because machines will never grasp nuance and connotation.\n\nTranslation of literary works (novels, short stories, plays, poems, etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right. Notable in Canadian literature \"specifically\" as translators are figures such as Sheila Fischman, Robert Dickson, and Linda Gaboriau; and the Canadian Governor General's Awards annually present prizes for the best English-to-French and French-to-English literary translations.\n\nOther writers, among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators, include Vasily Zhukovsky, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, Robert Stiller, Lydia Davis, Haruki Murakami, Achy Obejas, and Jhumpa Lahiri.\n\nIn the 2010s a substantial gender imbalance was noted in literary translation into English, with far more male writers being translated than women writers. In 2014 Meytal Radzinski launched the \"Women in Translation\" campaign to address this.\n\nThe first important translation in the West was that of the Septuagint, a collection of Jewish Scriptures translated into early Koine Greek in Alexandria between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE. The dispersed Jews had forgotten their ancestral language and needed Greek versions (translations) of their Scriptures.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Latin was the \"lingua franca\" of the western learned world. The 9th-century Alfred the Great, king of Wessex in England, was far ahead of his time in commissioning vernacular Anglo-Saxon translations of Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\" and Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\". Meanwhile, the Christian Church frowned on even partial adaptations of St. Jerome's \"Vulgate\" of c. 384 CE, the standard Latin \"Bible\".\n\nIn Asia, the spread of Buddhism led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The Tangut Empire was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented block printing, and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the Chinese centuries to render.\n\nThe Arabs undertook large-scale efforts at translation. Having conquered the Greek world, they made Arabic versions of its philosophical and scientific works. During the Middle Ages, translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at Córdoba in Spain. King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a \"Schola Traductorum\" (School of Translation) in Toledo. There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions. Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European Scholasticism, and thus European science and culture.\n\nThe broad historic trends in Western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the English language.\n\nThe first fine translations into English were made in the 14th century by Geoffrey Chaucer, who adapted from the Italian of Giovanni Boccaccio in his own \"Knight's Tale\" and \"Troilus and Criseyde\"; began a translation of the French-language \"Roman de la Rose\"; and completed a translation of Boethius from the Latin. Chaucer founded an English poetic tradition on \"adaptations\" and translations from those earlier-established literary languages.\n\nThe first great English translation was the \"Wycliffe Bible\" (c. 1382), which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English prose. Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte Darthur\"—an adaptation of Arthurian romances so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great Tudor translations are, accordingly, the \"Tyndale New Testament\" (1525), which influenced the \"Authorized Version\" (1611), and Lord Berners' version of Jean Froissart's \"Chronicles\" (1523–25).\n\nMeanwhile, in Renaissance Italy, a new period in the history of translation had opened in Florence with the arrival, at the court of Cosimo de' Medici, of the Byzantine scholar Georgius Gemistus Pletho shortly before the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of Plato's works was undertaken by Marsilio Ficino. This and Erasmus' Latin edition of the \"New Testament\" led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of Plato, Aristotle and Jesus.\n\nNon-scholarly literature, however, continued to rely on \"adaptation\". France's \"Pléiade\", England's Tudor poets, and the Elizabethan translators adapted themes by Horace, Ovid, Petrarch and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created by the rise of a middle class and the development of printing, with works such as the original authors \"would have written\", had they been writing in England in that day.\n\nThe Elizabethan period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere paraphrase toward an ideal of stylistic equivalence, but even to the end of this period, which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century, there was no concern for verbal accuracy.\n\nIn the second half of the 17th century, the poet John Dryden sought to make Virgil speak \"in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an Englishman\". As great as Dryden's poem is, however, one is reading Dryden, and not experiencing the Roman poet's concision. Similarly, Homer arguably suffers from Alexander Pope's endeavor to reduce the Greek poet's \"wild paradise\" to order. Both works live on as worthy \"English\" epics, more than as a point of access to the Latin or Greek.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or—as in the case of James Macpherson's \"translations\" of Ossian—from texts that were actually of the \"translator's\" own composition.\n\nThe 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became \"the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text\", except for any bawdy passages and the addition of copious explanatory footnotes. In regard to style, the Victorians' aim, achieved through far-reaching metaphrase (literality) or \"pseudo\"-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a \"foreign\" classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, Edward FitzGerald's \"Rubaiyat\" of Omar Khayyam (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.\n\nIn advance of the 20th century, a new pattern was set in 1871 by Benjamin Jowett, who translated Plato into simple, straightforward language. Jowett's example was not followed, however, until well into the new century, when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion.\n\nAs a language evolves, texts in an earlier version of the language—original texts, or old translations—may become difficult for modern readers to understand. Such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language, producing a \"modern translation\" (e.g., a \"modern English translation\" or \"modernized translation\").\n\nSuch modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as Latin or Greek, notably to the Bible (see \"Modern English Bible translations\"), or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language, as with the works of William Shakespeare (which are largely understandable by a modern audience, though with some difficulty) or with Geoffrey Chaucer's Middle English \"Canterbury Tales\" (which is understandable to most modern readers only through heavy dependence on footnotes).\n\nModern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history. For example, in Japanese the 11th-century \"Tale of Genji\" is generally read in modern translation (see \"\"Genji:\" modern readership\").\n\nModern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision, as there is frequently not one single canonical text. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the Bible and Shakespeare, where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes.\n\nModern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists. In English, some readers prefer the Authorized King James Version of the Bible to modern translations, and Shakespeare in the original of c. 1600 to modern translations.\n\nAn opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages, for the purpose of extensive reading (for examples, see \"List of Latin translations of modern literature\").\n\nViews on the possibility of satisfactorily translating poetry show a broad spectrum, depending largely on the degree of latitude to be granted the translator in regard to a poem's formal features (rhythm, rhyme, verse form, etc.). Douglas Hofstadter, in his 1997 book, \"Le Ton beau de Marot\", argued that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible not only of its literal meaning but also of its form and structure (meter, rhyme or alliteration scheme, etc.).\n\nThe Russian-born linguist and semiotician Roman Jakobson, however, had in his 1959 paper \"On Linguistic Aspects of Translation\", declared that \"poetry by definition [is] untranslatable\". Vladimir Nabokov, another Russian-born author, took a view similar to Jakobson's. He considered rhymed, metrical, versed poetry to be in principle untranslatable and therefore rendered his 1964 English translation of Alexander Pushkin's \"Eugene Onegin\" in prose.\n\nHofstadter, in \"Le Ton beau de Marot\", criticized Nabokov's attitude toward verse translation. In 1999 Hofstadter published his own translation of \"Eugene Onegin\", in verse form.\n\nGregory Hays, in the course of discussing Roman adapted translations of ancient Greek literature, makes approving reference to some views on the translating of poetry expressed by David Bellos, an accomplished French-to-English translator. Hays writes:\n\nBook-title translations can be either descriptive or symbolic. Descriptive book titles, for example Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's \"Le Petit Prince\" (The Little Prince), are meant to be informative, and can name the protagonist, and indicate the theme of the book. An example of a symbolic book title is Stieg Larsson's \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", whose original Swedish title is \"Män som hatar kvinnor\" (Men Who Hate Women). Such symbolic book titles usually indicate the theme, issues, or atmosphere of the work.\n\nWhen translators are working with long book titles, the translated titles are often shorter and indicate the theme of the book.\n\nThe translation of plays poses many problems such as the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, and the relationship between the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively. Play translators must also take into account several other aspects: the final performance, varying theatrical and acting traditions, characters' speaking styles, modern theatrical discourse, and even the acoustics of the auditorium, i.e., whether certain words will have the same effect on the new audience as they had on the original audience.\n\nAudiences in Shakespeare's time were more accustomed than modern playgoers to actors having longer stage time. Modern translators tend to simplify the sentence structures of earlier dramas, which included compound sentences with intricate hierarchies of subordinate clauses.\n\nIn translating Chinese literature, translators struggle to find true fidelity in translating into the target language. In \"The Poem Behind the Poem\", Barnstone argues that poetry \"can't be made to sing through a mathematics that doesn't factor in the creativity of the translator\".\n\nA notable piece of work translated into English is the \"Wen Xuan\", an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the genres presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must be familiar with the writings, lives, and thought of a large number of its 130 authors, making the \"Wen Xuan\" one of the most difficult literary works to translate.\n\nTranslation generally, much as with Kurt Gödel's conception of mathematics, requires, to varying extents, more information than appears in the page of text being translated.\n\nTranslation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called \"singing translation\"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most vocal music, at least in the Western tradition, is set to verse, especially verse in regular patterns with rhyme. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music, though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of stanzaic forms with or without refrains.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church hymns, such as the German chorales translated into English by Catherine Winkworth.\n\nTranslation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator. There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line.\n\nOther considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a contrafactum.\n\nTranslations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a language not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.\n\nAn important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey. For example, Buddhist monks who translated the Indian sutras into Chinese occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect China's distinct culture, emphasizing notions such as filial piety.\n\nOne of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the Old Testament into Greek in the 3rd century BCE. The translation is known as the \"Septuagint\", a name that refers to the supposedly seventy translators (seventy-two, in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the Bible at Alexandria, Egypt. According to legend, each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and, according to legend, all seventy versions proved identical. The \"Septuagint\" became the source text for later translations into many languages, including Latin, Coptic, Armenian and Georgian.\n\nStill considered one of the greatest translators in history, for having rendered the \"Bible\" into Latin, is Jerome (347–420 C.E.), the patron saint of translators. For centuries the Roman Catholic Church used his translation (known as the Vulgate), though even this translation stirred controversy. By contrast with Jerome's contemporary, Augustine of Hippo (354–430 C.E.), who endorsed precise translation, Jerome believed in adaptation, and sometimes invention, in order to more effectively bring across the meaning. Jerome's colorful Vulgate translation of the Bible includes some crucial instances of \"overdetermination\". For example, Isaiah's prophecy announcing that the Savior will be born of a virgin, uses the word \"'almah\", which is also used to describe the dancing girls at Solomon's court, and simply means young and nubile. Jerome, writes Marina Warner, translates it as \"virgo\", \"adding divine authority to the virulent cult of sexual disgust that shaped Christian moral theology (the [Moslem] \"Quran\", free from this linguistic trap, does not connect Mariam/Mary's miraculous nature with moral horror of sex).\" The apple that Eve offered to Adam, according to Mark Polizzotti, could equally well have been an apricot, orange, or banana; but Jerome liked the pun \"malus/malum\" (apple/evil}. \n\nPope Francis has suggested that the phrase \"lead us not into temptation\", in the Lord's Prayer found in the Gospels of Matthew (the first Gospel, written c. 80–90 C.E.) and Luke (the third Gospel, written c. 80–110 C.E.), should more properly be translated, \"do not let us fall into temptation\", commenting that God does not lead people into temptation—Satan does. Some important early Christian authors interpreted the Bible's Greek text and Jerome's Latin Vulgate similarly to Pope Francis. A.J.B. Higgins in 1943 showed that among the earliest Christian authors, the understanding and even the text of this devotional verse underwent considerable changes. These ancient writers suggest that, even if the Greek and Latin texts are left unmodified, something like \"do not let us fall\" could be an acceptable English rendering. Higgins cited Tertullian, the earliest of the Latin Church Fathers (c. 155–c. 240 C.E., \"do not allow us to be led\") and Cyprian (c. 200–258 C.E., \"do not allow us to be led into temptation\"). A later author, Ambrose (C. 340–397 C.E.), followed Cyprian's interpretation. Augustine of Hippo (354–430), familiar with Jerome's Latin Vulgate rendering, observed that \"many people... say it this way: 'and do not allow us to be led into temptation.'\" \n\nIn 863 C.E. the brothers Saints Cyril and Methodius, the Byzantine Empire's \"Apostles to the Slavs\", began translating parts of the Bible into the Old Church Slavonic language, using the Glagolitic script that they had devised, based on the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe periods preceding and contemporary with the Protestant Reformation saw translations of the Bible into vernacular (local) European languages—a development that contributed to Western Christianity's split into Roman Catholicism and Protestantism over disparities between Catholic and Protestant renderings of crucial words and passages (and due to a Protestant-perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church). Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such Bible translations as Martin Luther's into German (the New Testament, 1522), Jakub Wujek's into Polish (1599, as revised by the Jesuits), and William Tyndale's (New Testament, 1526 and revisions) and the \"King James Version\" into English (1611). \n\nEfforts to translate the Bible into English had their martyrs. William Tyndale (c. 1494–1536) was convicted of heresy at Antwerp, was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned. Earlier, John Wycliffe (c. mid-1320s – 1384) had managed to die a natural death, but 30 years later the Council of Constance in 1415 declared him a heretic and decreed that his works and earthly remains should be burned; the order, confirmed by Pope Martin V, was carried out in 1428, and Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the River Swift. Debate and religious schism over different translations of religious texts continue, as demonstrated by, for example, the King James Only movement.\n\nA famous \"mistranslation\" of a Biblical text is the rendering of the Hebrew word (\"keren\"), which has several meanings, as \"horn\" in a context where it more plausibly means \"beam of light\": as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor Michelangelo, have rendered Moses the Lawgiver with horns growing from his forehead.\n\nSuch fallibility of the translation process has contributed to the Islamic world's ambivalence about translating the \"Quran\" (also spelled \"Koran\") from the original Arabic, as received by the prophet Muhammad from Allah (God) through the angel Gabriel incrementally between 609 and 632 C.E., the year of Muhammad's death. During prayers, the \"Quran\", as the miraculous and inimitable word of Allah, is recited only in Arabic. However, as of 1936, it had been translated into at least 102 languages.\n\nA fundamental difficulty in translating the \"Quran\" accurately stems from the fact that an Arabic word, like a Hebrew or Aramaic word, may have a range of meanings, depending on context. This is said to be a linguistic feature, particularly of all Semitic languages, that adds to the usual similar difficulties encountered in translating between any two languages. There is always an element of human judgment—of interpretation—involved in understanding and translating a text. Muslims regard any translation of the \"Quran\" as but one possible interpretation of the Quranic (Classical) Arabic text, and not as a full equivalent of that divinely communicated original. Hence such a translation is often called an \"interpretation\" rather than a translation.\n\nTo complicate matters further, as with other languages, the meanings and usages of some expressions have changed \"over time\", between the Classical Arabic of the \"Quran\", and modern Arabic. Thus a modern Arabic speaker may misinterpret the meaning of a word or passage in the \"Quran\". Moreover, the interpretation of a Quranic passage will also depend on the historic context of Muhammad's life and of his early community. Properly researching that context requires a detailed knowledge of \"hadith\" and \"sirah\", which are themselves vast and complex texts. Hence, analogously to the translating of Chinese literature, an attempt at an accurate translation of the \"Quran\" requires a knowledge not only of the Arabic language and of the target language, including their respective evolutions, but also a deep understanding of the two cultures involved.\n\nTechnical translation renders documents such as manuals, instruction sheets, internal memos, minutes, financial reports, and other documents for a limited audience (who are directly affected by the document) and whose useful life is often limited. Thus, a user guide for a particular model of refrigerator is useful only for the owner of the refrigerator, and will remain useful only as long as that refrigerator model is in use. Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose applications are used only by a certain class of users.\n\n\n\n"}

The practice teaches that currents of energy are stored within the human skeleton, and that these affect both physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nZero balancing is pseudoscientific.\n\nAccording to Frederick Smith, the founder of zero balancing,\"Zero balancing teaches that the deepest currents of energy are in bone, that memory can be held in tissue, that energy fields in the body underlie mind, body and emotions, and that imbalances in the field precede pathology\".\n\nThe Zero Balancing Health Association say that zero balancing \"uses skilled touch to address the relationship between energy and structures of the body\".\n\nThe concept underlying zero balancing is based on vitalism and it is a type of pseudoscience. Skeptic and lawyer Jann Bellamy has written that zero balancing is \"a perfect example of how a promoter can fabricate a treatment and sell it to credulous clients and practitioners\".\n\nFritz Smith was born in 1929, trained and licensed as an Osteopathic Physician and Surgeon in 1955 and received an M.D. in 1961 in the state of California.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Smith studied with several teachers at the Esalen Institute in Northern California, among them Ida Pauline Rolf, founder of Rolfing Structural Integration and J. R. Worsley, founder of the College of Traditional Chinese Acupuncture in London, England. Under Worsley, Smith became the first American to earn the Diploma of Acupuncture at the College of Traditional Chinese Acupuncture in London, in 1972. He also studied with Swami Muktananda, the founder of Siddha Yoga.\n\nSmith began to integrate principles of traditional Chinese medicine with his osteopathic and Structural Integration training. This led him to develop the manual touch therapy system of zero balancing in the early 1970s. The name came about when someone receiving his work described their feeling after the experience as \"I feel so well-balanced, like I'm zero; zero-balanced.\"\n\nSmith is the author of many articles and two books, \"Inner Bridges: A Guide to Energy Movement and Body Structure\" and \"Alchemy of Touch: Moving Towards Mastery Through the Lens of Zero Balancing.\"\n\nIn 2004 The Times reported that becoming a zero balancing practitioner required less time than many other therapies, about 15 days of classroom time plus additional case work and supervised sessions.\n\nThe practice is considered a placebo by skeptics.\nClinical professor and orthopedic surgeon Richard Coughlin said: \"I'm a bone doctor and what's in there is all circulatory; I'm less likely to think my sensory input is coming from my pelvis.\"\n\nQuackWatch lists the Zero Balancing Association as one of about 750 \"questionable organizations.\"\n\n\n"}
