{"id": "6274217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6274217", "title": "Actus purus", "text": "Actus purus\n\nIn scholastic philosophy, actus purus ( literally \"pure act\") is the absolute perfection of God.\n\nCreated beings have potentiality that is not actuality, imperfections as well as perfection. Only God is simultaneously all that He can be, infinitely real and infinitely perfect: 'I am who I am' (Exodus ). His attributes or His operations are really identical with His essence, and His essence necessitates His existence. (Contrast this understanding with the Essence–Energies distinction in Eastern Christian, particularly Palamite, theology).\n\nIn created beings, the state of potentiality precedes that of actuality; before being realized, a perfection must be capable of realization. But, absolutely speaking, actuality precedes potentiality. For in order to change, a thing must be acted upon, or actualized; change and potentiality presuppose, therefore, a being which is \"in actu\". This actuality, if mixed with potentiality, presupposes another actuality, and so on, until we reach the \"actus purus\".\n\nAccording to Thomas Aquinas a thing which requires completion by another is said to be in potency to that other: realization of potency is called actuality. The universe is conceived of as a series of things arranged in an ascending order, or potency and act at once crowned and created by God, who alone is pure act. God is changeless because change means passage from potency to act, and so he is without beginning and end, since these demand change. Matter and form are necessary to the understanding of change, for change requires the union of that which becomes and that which it becomes. Matter is the first, and form the second. All physical things are composed of matter and form. The difference between a thing as form or character and the actual existence of it is denoted by the terms essence and being (or existence). It is only in God that there is no distinction between the two. Both pairs - matter & form and essence & being - are special cases of potency and act. They are also modes: modes do not add anything to the idea of being, but are ways of making explicit what is implicit in it.\n\n"}
{"id": "31660349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31660349", "title": "Aeon (Gnosticism)", "text": "Aeon (Gnosticism)\n\nIn many Gnostic systems, various emanations of \"God\" are known by such names as One, Monad, \"Aion teleos\" (αἰών τέλεος \"The Broadest Aeon\"), Bythos (\"depth or profundity\", ), \"Proarkhe\" (\"before the beginning\", ), \"Arkhe\" (\"the beginning\", ), and Aeons. In different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described, but emanation theory is common to all forms of Gnosticism. In Basilidian Gnosis they are called sonships (υἱότητες \"huiotetes\"; sing.: υἱότης \"huiotes\"); according to Marcus, they are numbers and sounds; in Valentinianism they form male/female pairs called syzygies (Greek , from σύζυγοι \"syzygoi\", lit. \"yokings together\").\n\nThis source of all being is an Aeon, in which an inner being dwells, known as \"Ennoea\" (\"thought, intent\", Greek ), \"Charis\" (\"grace\", Greek ), or \"Sige\" (\"silence\", Greek ). The split perfect being conceives the second Aeon, \"Nous\" (\"mind\", Greek Νους), within itself. Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus produced, sometimes to the number of thirty. These Aeons belong to a purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are hypostatic ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate, they form \"Pleroma\" (\"region of light\", Greek ). The lowest regions of Pleroma are closest to darkness—that is, the physical world.\n\nThe transition from immaterial to material, from noumenal to sensible, is created by a flaw, passion, or sin in an Aeon. According to Basilides, it is a flaw in the last sonship; according to others the sin of the Great Archon, or Aeon-Creator, of the Universe; according to others it is the passion of the female Aeon Sophia, who emanates without her partner Aeon, resulting in the \"Demiurge\" (Greek ), a creature that should never have been. This creature does not belong to Pleroma, and the One emanates two savior Aeons, \"Christ\" and \"the Holy Spirit\", to save humanity from the Demiurge. Christ then took a human form (\"Jesus\"), to teach humanity how to achieve Gnosis. The ultimate end of all Gnosis is μετάνοια \"metanoia\", or repentance—undoing the sin of material existence and returning to Pleroma.\n\nAeons bear a number of similarities to Judaeo-Christian angels, including roles as servants and emanations of God, and existing as beings of light. In fact, certain Gnostic Angels, such as Armozel, are also Aeons. The Gnostic Gospel of Judas, recently found, purchased, held, and translated by the National Geographic Society, also mentions Aeons and speaks of Jesus' teachings about them.\n\nValentinus assumed, as the beginning of all things, the Primal Being or Bythos, who after ages of silence and contemplation, gave rise to other beings by a process of emanation. The first series of beings, the Aeons, were thirty in number, representing fifteen syzygies or pairs sexually complementary. One common form is outlined below:\n\nThe Valentinian system was, until recently, only known through the criticisms of its opponents; however, the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library has given access to Valentinian texts, including sources that have been tentatively identified as written by Valentinus.\n\nTertullian's \"Against the Valentinians\" gives a slightly different sequence. The first eight of these Aeons, corresponding to generations one through four below, are referred to as the \"Ogdoad.\"\n\n\nAccording to Irenaeus, the followers of the Gnostics Ptolemy and Colorbasus had Aeons that differ from those of Valentinus. Logos is created when Anthropos learns to speak. The first four are called the \"Tetrad\", and the eight are the \"Ogdoad\" deities of the Ancient Egyptian pantheon.\n\n\nThe order of Anthropos and Ecclesia versus Logos and Zoe is somewhat debated; different sources give different accounts. Logos and Zoe are unique to this system as compared to the previous, and may be an evolved version of the first, totalling 32 Aeons, but it is not clear if the first two were actually regarded Aeons.\nIn the system of Valentinus, as expounded by Irenaeus (i. 1), the origin of things was traced to two eternal co-existent principles, a male and a female. The male was called Bythos or Proarche, or Propator, etc.; the female had the names Ennoea, Charis and Sige. The whole Aeonology of Valentinus was based on a theory of syzygies, or pairs of Aeons, each Aeon being provided with a consort; and the supposed need of the co-operation of a male and female principle for the generation of new ones, was common to Valentinus and some earlier Gnostic systems. But it was a disputed point in these systems whether the First Principle of all was thus twofold. There were those, both in earlier systems, and even among the Valentinians who held, that the origin of things was to be traced to a single Principle, which some described as hermaphrodite; others said was above all sex. And among the Valentinians who counted thirty Aeons, there were those who counted Bythos and Sige as the first pair; others who asserted the Single Principle excluded Bythos from the number, and made out the number of thirty without reckoning him. Thus Irenaeus says of the Valentinians (I. ii. 4. p. 10), \"For they maintain that sometimes the Father acts in conjunction with Sige, but that at other times he shows himself independent both of male and female.\" And () \"For some declare him to be without a consort, and neither male nor female, and, in fact, nothing at all; while others affirm him to be masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature of a hermaphrodite; others, again, allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus may be formed the first conjunction.\"\n\nHippolytus supposes Valentinus to have derived his system from that of Simon; and in that as expounded in the \"Apophasis Megale\", from which he gives extracts, the origin of things is derived from six roots, divided into three pairs; but all these roots spring from a single independent Principle, which is without consort. The name Sige occurs in the description which Hippolytus (vi. 18) quotes from the \"Apophasis\", how from the supreme Principle there arise the male and female offshoots \"nous\" and \"epinoia\". The name Sige is there given not to either of the offshoots but to the supreme Principle itself: however, in the description, these offshoots appear less as distinct entities than as different aspects of the same Being.\n\nCyril of Jerusalem (\"Catech\". vi. 17) makes Sige the daughter of Bythos and by him the mother of Logos, a fable which he classes with the incests which heathen mythology attributed to Jupiter. Irenaeus () ridicules the absurdity of the later form of Valentinian theory, in which Sige and Logos are represented as coexistent Aeons in the same Pleroma. \"Where there is Silence\" he says, \"there will not be Word; and where there is Word, there cannot be Silence\". He goes on () to trace the invention of Sige to the heathen poets, quoting Antiphanes, who in his Theogony makes Chaos the offspring of Night and Silence.\n\nIn the attempts made by the framers of different Gnostic systems to explain the origin of the existing world, the first stage in the process was usually made by personifying the conception in the divine mind of that which was to emanate from Him. We learn from Justin Martyr (\"Ap\". I. 26), and from Irenaeus (), that the word Ennoea was used in a technical sense in the system of Simon. The Latin translation of Irenaeas either retains the word, or renders \"mentis conceptio.\" Tertullian has \"injectio\" (\"De Anima\", 34). In the \"Apophasis Megale\" cited by Hippolytus (\"Ref\". vi. 18, 19, p. 174), the word used is not \"Ennoia\" but \"Epinoia\". Irenaeus states () that the word Ennoea passed from the system of Simon into that of Menander. In the Barbeliot system which Irenaeus also counts as derived from that of Simon (), Ennoea appears as one of the first in the series of emanations from the unnameable Father.\n\nIn the system of Valentinus () Ennoea is one of several alternative names for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos. For the somewhat different form in which Ptolemaeus presented this part of the system see Irenaeus (). Irenaeus criticises this part of the system (). The name Ennoea is similarly used in the Ophite system described by Irenaeus ().\n\nCharis, in the system of Valentinus, was an alternative name, with Ennoea and Sige, for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos (). The name expresses that aspect of the absolute Greatness in which it is regarded not as a solitary monad, but as imparting from its perfection to beings of which it is the ultimate source; and this is the explanation given in the Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (\"Haer\". xxxi. 6), \"dia to epikechoregekenai auten thesaurismata tou Megethous tois ek tou Megethous\". The use of the word Charis enabled Ptolemaeus (quoted by ) to find in the first tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes, Charis, Aletheia. The suspicion arises that it was with a view to such an identification that names to be found in the prologue of St. John's Gospel were added as alternative appellations to the original names of the Aeons. But this is a point on which we have no data to pronounce. Charis has an important place in the system of Marcus (). The name Charis appears also in the system of the Barbelitae (), but as denoting a later emanation than in the Valentinian system. The word has possibly also a technical meaning in the Ophite prayers preserved by Origen (), all of which end with the invocation \"he charis synesto moi, nai pater, synesto.\n\nThis higher Ecclesia was held to be the archetype of the lower Ecclesia constituted by the spiritual seed on earth ( 6, p. 28). In a Gnostic system described by Irenaeus ( p. 109) we have also a heavenly church, not, however, as a separate Aeon, but as constituted by the harmony of the first existing beings. According to Hippolytus (v. 6, p. 95), the Naassenes counted three Ecclesiae.\n\nIt is especially in the case of the church that we find in Christian speculation prior to Valentinus traces of the conception, which lies at the root of the whole doctrine of Aeons, that earthly things have their archetypes in preexistent heavenly things. Hermas (\"Vis\". ii. 4) speaks of the church as created before all things and of the world as formed for her sake; and in the newly discovered portion of the so-called Second Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians (c. 14) the writer speaks of the spiritual church as created before the sun and moon, as pre-existent like Christ Himself, and like him manifested in the last days for men's salvation; and he even uses language which, if it were not sufficiently accounted for by what is said in the Epistle to the Ephesians as to the union between Christ and His church, might be supposed to have affinity with the Valentinian doctrine of the relation between Anthropos and Ecclesia.\n\nThe author of the Epistle to the Hebrews quotes the direction to Moses to make the tabernacle after the pattern shewn him on the Mount (a passage cited in ), and his argument dwells on the inference that the various parts of the Jewish service were but copies of better heavenly archetypes. This same heavenly tabernacle appears as part of the imagery of the book of the Revelation (, ). In the same book the church appears as the Lamb's wife, the new Jerusalem descending from heaven; and St. Paul's teaching () might be thrown into the form that the church existed in God's election before the foundation of the world.\n\nAs the world is an image of the living Aeon (\"tou zontos aionos\"), so is man an image of the pre-existent man of the \"anthrops proon\". Valentinus, according to Clemens Alexandrinus (), spoke of the Sophia as an artist (\"zographos\") making this visible lower world a picture of the glorious Archetype, but the hearer or reader would as readily understand the heavenly wisdom of the Book of Proverbs to be meant by this Sophia, as the 12th and fallen Aeon. Under her (according to Valentinus) stand the world-creative angels, whose head is the Demiurge. Her formation (\"plasma\") is Adam created in the name of the \"Anthropos proon\". In him thus made a higher power puts the seed of the heavenly pneumatic essence (\"sperma tes anothen ousias\"). Thus furnished with higher insight, Adam excites the fears of the angels; for even as \"kosmikoi anthropoi\" are seized with fear of the images made by their own hands to bear the name of God, \"i.e.\" the idols, so these angels cause the images they have made to disappear ().\nAccording to the doctrine of Valentinus, as described by , the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her passion to comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming in contact with the limiting power \"Horos\", whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert a danger that threatened to affect them all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of a new pair of Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the permanence of the order thus produced. Irenaeus (\"u. s.\") reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair.\n\nThe Valentinian fragment in Epiphanius (\"Haer\". 31, p. 171), which seems to give a more ancient form of this heresy, knows nothing of Horos, but it relates as the last spiritual birth the generation of five beings without consorts, whose names are used in the Irenaean version as titles for the supernumerary Aeon Horos. But besides, this Aeon has a sixth name, which in the version of Hippolytus is made his primary title \"Stauros;\" and it is explained () that besides his function as a separator, in respect of which he is called Horos, this Aeon does the work of stablishing and settling, in respect of which he is called Stauros. A derivation from \"sterizo\" is hinted at.\n\nThe literal earthly crucifixion of the Saviour (that seen by the psychic church, which only believes in the \"historical\" Jesus) was meant to represent an \"archetypal\" scene in the world of Aeons, when the younger Sophia, Achamoth, is healed through the Savior's instrumentation. \n\nThe distinction just explained as to the different use of the names Horos and Stauros was not carefully observed by Valentinians. Thus the last word is sometimes used when the function of separation and division is spoken of (\"Excerpt. ex Script. Theodot.\" 22 and 42, Clem. Alex. ii. pp. 974, 979), it being remarked in the latter passage that the cross separates the faithful from the unbelievers; and Clem. Alex., who occasionally uses Valentinian language in an orthodox sense, speaks in the same way (\"Paed\". iii. 12, p. 303, and \"Strom\". ii. 20, p. 486).\n\nIn the Valentinian theory there is a double Horos, or at least a double function discharged by Horos. \n\nOn the one hand, he discharges as already described, a function within the Pleroma, separating the other Aeons from the ineffable Bythos, and saving them from absorption into his essence. On the other hand, Horos is the outside boundary of the Pleroma itself, giving it permanence and stability by guarding it against the intrusion of any foreign element. \nThe animated TV series \"Æon Flux\" draws its name and some of its iconography from Gnosticism, notably aeons (the two main characters forming a syzygy) and a demiurge.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21438629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21438629", "title": "Animal rights and the Holocaust", "text": "Animal rights and the Holocaust\n\nSeveral writers, including Jewish Nobel Prize laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer, and animal rights groups have drawn a comparison between the treatment of animals and the Holocaust. The comparison is regarded as controversial, and has been criticized by organizations that campaign against antisemitism, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nA character in one of Singer's stories described the treatment of animals by humans as \"an eternal Treblinka\". Similarly, the eponymous character in J. M. Coetzee's \"Elizabeth Costello\" compared the Nazis' treatment of Jews to methods used by the meat industry to herd and slaughter cattle. The comparison began immediately after the end of World War II, when Jewish writers recounted the lack of resistance by European Jewish victims of the Holocaust, who were led to their death as \"sheep to slaughter\". The ADL argues, however, that the subsequent use of Holocaust imagery by animal rights activists is a \"disturbing development\".\n\nRoberta Kalechofsky of Jews for Animal Rights argues in her essay \"Animal Suffering and the Holocaust: The Problem with Comparisons\" that, although there is \"connective tissue\" between animal suffering and the Holocaust, they \"fall into different historical frameworks, and comparison between them aborts the ... force of anti-Semitism.\" She has also written that she \"agree[s] with I.B. Singer's statement, that 'every day is Treblinka for the animals, but concludes that \"some agonies are too total to be compared with other agonies.\"\nJewish author Isaac Bashevis Singer, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978, made the comparison in several of his stories, including \"Enemies, A Love Story,\" \"The Penitent,\" and \"The Letter Writer.\" In the latter the protagonist says, \"In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.\"\nIn \"The Penitent\" the protagonist says \"when it comes to animals, every man is a Nazi.\"\n\nEdgar Kupfer-Koberwitz, a pacifist, conscientious objector and Holocaust victim who was sent to Dachau for \"being a strong autonomously thinking personality\", wrote in his \"Dachau Diaries\" (kept at the University of Chicago Library) that \"I have suffered so much myself that I can feel other creatures' suffering by virtue of my own\". He further wrote, \"I believe as long as man tortures and kills animals, he will torture and kill humans as well—and wars will be waged—for killing must be practiced and learned on a small scale\".\n\nBelgian writer Marguerite Yourcenar also made the comparison. She wrote that if we had not accepted the inhumane transportation of animals to the slaughterhouses we would not have accepted the transportation of humans to the concentration camps. In another article, making the same connection, she wrote that every act of cruelty suffered by thousands of living creatures is a crime against humanity.\n\nJ. M. Coetzee, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, invoked the image of the slaughterhouse in describing the Nazi's treatment of Jews: \"... in the 20th century, a group of powerful and bloody-minded men in Germany hit on the idea of adapting the methods of the industrial stockyard, as pioneered and perfected in Chicago, to the slaughter – or what they preferred to call the processing – of human beings.\"\n\nThe ADL lists a number of animal rights groups that have made the comparison. The magazine \"No Compromise\" introduced the Animal Liberation Front with the words: \"If we are trespassing, so were the soldiers who broke down the gates of Hitler's death camps; If we are thieves, so were the members of the Underground Railroad who freed the slaves of the South; And if we are vandals, so were those who destroyed Forever the gas chambers of Buchenwald and Auschwitz.\"\n\nIn 2001, Meat.org included an \"Animal Holocaust\" section containing photographs of animals with captions such as \"Holocaust Victim\", arguing that it's \"easy to see the resemblance of the systematic destruction and slaughter of over six million Jews by the Nazis before and during World War II and the over 20 million animals that are executed every day in America alone. Many of the Jews of the Holocaust were transported to concentration camps in cattle cars to their death. The concentration camps very much resemble the common slaughterhouses of today.\"\n\nThe Consistency in Compassion Campaign (CCC), a project of the Northwest Animal Rights Network of Seattle, Washington, argues that \"the Holocaust stands for much more than the one event. It represents a place and time when supremacist thinking was so embedded in a culture that they were blind or apathetic to the evil that existed in their everyday world. This kind of thinking is not exclusive to just that time and place. The great blind spot of our country and Western Civilization for that matter is the mistreatment and disregard for non-human animals in nearly every capacity.\"\n\nIngrid Newkirk, the president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), has herself made the comparison unambiguously, saying: \"Six million Jews died in concentration camps, but six billion broiler chickens will die this year in slaughterhouses.\"\n\nPETA has twice used Holocaust imagery in its campaigns. In July 2003, a PETA television public service announcement called \"They came for us at night\" aired on U.S. cable networks, narrated by a man describing what it felt like to be transported without food or water.\n\nIn the same year, PETA's \"Holocaust on your Plate\" exhibition consisted of eight panels, each juxtaposing images of the Holocaust with images of factory-farmed animals. Photographs of concentration camp inmates were displayed next to photographs of battery chickens, and piled bodies of Holocaust victims next to a pile of pig carcasses. Captions alleged that \"like the Jews murdered in concentration camps, animals are terrorized when they are housed in huge filthy warehouses and rounded up for shipment to slaughter. The leather sofa and handbag are the moral equivalent of the lampshades made from the skins of people killed in the death camps.\"\n\nThe exhibition was funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist, and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: \"The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible – that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior' – is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms.\"\n\nAbraham Foxman, chairman of the ADL, said the exhibition was \"outrageous, offensive and takes chutzpah to new heights ... The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent.\" Stuart Bender, legal counsel for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, wrote to PETA asking them to \"cease and desist this reprehensible misuse of Holocaust materials.\" There were also differing opinions within the animal rights movement. Roberta Kalechofsky wrote: \"While I sympathize with PETA's aim—and am a member of PETA—I objected to this use of the Holocaust... The agony of animals arises from different causes from those of the Holocaust. Human beings do not hate animals. They do not eat them because they hate them. They do not experiment on them because they hate them, they do not hunt them because they hate them. These were the motives for the Holocaust. Human beings have no ideological or theological conflict with animals.\"\n\nIn 2005, Newkirk apologized for the pain the campaign had caused some people, while defending the goals of the campaign, writing:\n\n\"The Guardian\" subsequently reported, however, that \"the appeal has done little to calm the fury of Jewish groups.\" The campaign was also banned in Germany for making the Holocaust seem \"insignificant and banal\", to which Peter Singer, the noted animal rights advocate and writer, and a descendant of Holocaust survivors, replied by noting that \"... if Peta is not allowed to state its case against our abuse of animals in the way that they judge best, because doing so might offend some people, then criticism of religion could also be prohibited on the same grounds.\"\n\nOn February 20, 2009, the German Federal Constitutional Court dismissed a legal move challenging an appeal court's ruling that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws. While not entering formal proceedings to decide in the matter, the court expressed severe doubts as to whether the campaign constituted an offense against human rights in its opinion to dismiss the appeal, as had been found by the orderly courts, but acceded to the other grounds of the former rulings that the campaign constituted a trivialization of the Holocaust and hence a severe violation of living Jews' personality rights. The subtleties of the ruling are sometimes not reflected adequately in press reports.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37522784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37522784", "title": "Art and emotion", "text": "Art and emotion\n\nIn psychology of art, the relationship between art and emotion has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian Alexander Nemerov. Emotional or aesthetic responses to art have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally. Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression. Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition. Instead, brain regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.\n\nEvolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.\n\nOther methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. Symmetry is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were bilaterally symmetrical, as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.\n\nAnother example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, relaxation, or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of anxiety and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.\n\nThe optimal visual artwork creates what Noy & Noy-Sharav call \"meta-emotions.\" These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce \"meta-emotions.\" For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of Christ on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's crucifixion are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.\n\nNoy & Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and dance to music for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message ./..\n"}

He was the author of a partly biographical psychological novel, \"Adolphe\". He was a fervent liberal of the early 19th century, who influenced the Trienio Liberal movement in Spain, the Liberal Revolution of 1820 in Portugal, the Greek War of Independence, the November Uprising in Poland, the Belgian Revolution, and liberalism in Brazil and Mexico.\n\nHenri-Benjamin Constant was born in Lausanne to descendants of Huguenot Protestants who had fled from Artois to Switzerland during the Huguenot Wars in the 16th century. His father, Jules Constant de Rebecque, served as a high-ranking officer in the Dutch States Army, like his grandfather, his uncle and his cousin Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque. When Constant's mother died soon after his birth, both his grandmothers took care of him. Private tutors educated him in Brussels (1779) and in the Netherlands (1780). At the Protestant University of Erlangen (1783), he gained appointment to the court of Duchess Sophie Caroline Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. He had to leave after an affair with a girl, and moved to the University of Edinburgh. There he lived at the home of Andrew Duncan, the elder and became friends with James Mackintosh\nand Malcolm Laing. When he left the city, he promised to pay back his gambling debts.\n\nIn 1787, he returned, traveling on horseback through England and Scotland. In those years the European nobility, with their prerogatives, had come under heavy attack by those who were influenced by Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality; Constant's family criticized him when he left out part of his last name.\nIn Paris, at the home of Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard he became acquainted with Isabelle de Charriere, a 46-year old Dutch woman and writer, who later helped publish Rousseau's Confessions, and who knew his uncle David-Louis Constant de Rebecque extremely well by correspondence for 15 years. When he stayed at her home in Colombier Switzerland, they wrote an epistolary novel together. She acted as a mother to him until Constant's appointment to the court of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel that required him to move north. He left the court when the War of the First Coalition began in 1792.\n\nIn Brunswick, he had married Wilhelmina von Cramm, but he divorced her in 1793. In September 1794, he met and became interested in the famous and rich (but married) Anne Louise Germaine de Staël, brought up on the principles of Rousseau. They both admired Jean Lambert Tallien and Talleyrand. Their intellectual collaboration between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of their time.\n\nAfter the Reign of Terror in France (1793–1794), Constant became a defender of bicameralism and of the Parliament of Great Britain. In revolutionary France this strand of political thought resulted in the Constitution of the Year III, the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients. In 1799, after 18 Brumaire, Constant was appointed by Napoleon Bonaparte to the Tribunat, but in 1802, the first consul forced him to withdraw because of his speeches and his connections with Mme de Staël.\n\nConstant became acquainted with Julie Talma, the wife of François-Joseph Talma, who wrote him many letters of compelling human interest.\n\nIn 1800, the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, an act of terror, failed. In 1803, at a time when Britain and France were at peace, Jean Gabriel Peltier, while living in England, argued that Napoleon should be killed. The lawyer James Mackintosh defended the French refugee against a libel suit instigated by Napoleon – then First Consul of France. Mackintosh's speech was widely published in English and also across Europe in a French translation by Madame de Staël. She was forced to leave Paris.\n\nDe Staël, disappointed in French Rationalism, became interested in German Romanticism. Constant moved with her and their two children to Weimar. Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel welcomed them the day after their arrival. In Weimar they met Friedrich von Schiller; Johann Wolfgang Goethe at first hesitated. In Berlin, they met with August Wilhelm Schlegel, and his brother, Friedrich Schlegel. Constant parted from de Stael and in 1806 lived in Rouen and Meulan, where he started to work on his novel \"Adolphe\". In 1809, he secretly married Caroline von Hardenberg, a woman who had been divorced twice, (she was related to Novalis and to Karl August von Hardenberg). He moved back to Paris in 1814, where Louis XVIII of France had become king. As a member of the Council of State; Constant defended the constitutional monarchy. He became friends with Madame Récamier and argued with Germaine de Staël, who had asked him to pay his debts when their daughter Albertine married Victor de Broglie. During the Hundred Days of Napoleon, who had become more liberal, Constant fled to the Vendée, but returned when he was invited several times at the Tuileries in order to set up changes for the Charter of 1815.\n\nAfter the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), Constant moved to London – not in the company of Madame Récamier, who went south, but with his wife. In 1817, back in Paris, he sat in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower legislative house of the Restoration-era government. One of its most eloquent orators, he became a leader of the parliamentary bloc first known as the \"Independants\" and later as \"liberals\". He became an opponent of Charles X of France during the Restoration \nbetween 1815 and 1830.\n\nIn 1822, in light of Constant's political career, Goethe praised him in the following terms:\n\nI spent many instructive evenings with Benjamin Constant. Whoever recollects what this excellent man accomplished in [later] years, and with what zeal he advanced without wavering along the path which, once chosen, was forever followed, realizes what noble aspirations, as yet undeveloped, were fermenting within him.\n\nIn 1830, King Louis Philippe I gave Constant a large sum of money to pay off his debts, and appointed him to the Conseil d'Etat.\n\nOne of the first thinkers to go by the name of \"liberal\", Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large, commercial society. He drew a distinction between the \"Liberty of the Ancients\" and the \"Liberty of the Moderns\". The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to directly influence politics through debates and votes in the public assembly. In order to support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous societies, in which the people could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.\n\nThe Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of civil liberties, the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a commercial society in which there are no slaves but almost everybody must earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from the necessity of daily political involvement.\n\nHe chastised several aspects of the French Revolution, and the failures within the social and political upheaval. He stated how the French attempted to apply ancient republic liberties to the modern state. Constant realized that freedom meant drawing a line between the area of a person's private life and that of public authority. He admired the noble spirit of regeneration of the state; however, he stated that it was naïve that writers believed that two thousand years had not wrought some changes in the disposition and needs of the people. The dynamics of the state had changed: the ancient states' population paled in comparison to that of modern countries. He even argued that with a large population, man had no role in government regardless of its form or type. Constant emphasized how the citizens of the ancient state found more satisfaction in their public existence and less in their private. However, the satisfaction of modern peoples occurs in their private existence.\n\nConstant's repeated denunciation of despotism pervaded his critique of French political philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Abbé de Mably. These writers, influential to the French Revolution, according to Constant mistook authority for liberty and approved any means of extending the action of authority. Reformers used the model of ancient states of public force, and organized the most absolute despotism under the name of the Republic. He continued to condemn despotism, citing the paradox of liberty derived from recourse to despotism, and the lack of substance in this ideology.\n\nFurthermore, he pointed out the detrimental nature of the Reign of Terror; the inexplicable delirium. In François Furet's words, Constant's \"entire political thought\" revolved around this question, namely the problem of explaining the Terror. Constant understood the revolutionaries' disastrous over-investment in the political. The French revolutionaries such as the Sans-culottes were the primary forces in the streets. They promoted constant vigilance and a public emphasis. Constant pointed out how the most obscure life, the quietest existence, the most unknown name, offered no protection during the Reign of Terror. He also stated that each individual added to the number, and took fright in the number that he had helped increase. This mob mentality deterred many and helped to usher in new despots such as Napoleon.\n\nMoreover, Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to war. He attacked Napoleon's martial appetite, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to be warlike, whereas a state organized on the principles of Modern Liberty would be at peace with all peaceful nations.\n\nConstant believed that if liberty were to be salvaged from the aftermath of the Revolution, then chimerical Ancient Liberty had to be reconciled with the practical and achievable Modern Liberty. England, since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and then the United Kingdom after 1707, had demonstrated the practicality of Modern Liberty and Britain was a constitutional monarchy. Constant concluded that constitutional monarchy was better suited than republicanism to maintaining Modern Liberty. He was instrumental in drafting the \"Acte Additional\" of 1815, which transformed Napoleon's restored rule into a modern constitutional monarchy. This was only to last for \"One Hundred Days\" before Napoleon was defeated, but Constant's work nevertheless provided a means of reconciling monarchy with liberty. Indeed, the French Constitution (or Charter) of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of Constant's ideas: a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected Chamber of Deputies and a senatorial Chamber of Peers, with the executive power vested in responsible ministers. Thus, although often ignored in France because of his Anglo-Saxon sympathies, Constant made a profound (albeit indirect) contribution to French constitutional traditions.\n\nSecondly, Constant developed a new theory of constitutional monarchy, in which royal power was intended to be a neutral power, protecting, balancing and restraining the excesses of the other, active powers (the executive, legislature, and judiciary). This was an advance on the prevailing theory in the English-speaking world, which, following the conventional wisdom of William Blackstone, the 18th-century English jurist, had reckoned the King to be head of the executive branch. In Constant's scheme, the executive power was entrusted to a Council of Ministers (or Cabinet) who, although appointed by the King, were ultimately responsible to Parliament. In making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the King (as head of state) and the ministers (as Executive) Constant was responding to the political reality which had been apparent in Britain for more than a century: that the ministers, and not the King, are responsible, and therefore that the King \"reigns but does not rule\". This was important for the development of parliamentary government in France and elsewhere. It should be noted, however, that the King was not to be a powerless cipher in Constant's scheme: he would have many powers, including the power to make judicial appointments, to dissolve the Chamber and call new elections, to appoint the peers, and to dismiss ministers – but he would not be able to govern, make policy, or direct the administration, since that would be the task of the responsible ministers. This theory was literally applied in Portugal (1822) and Brazil (1824), where the King/Emperor was explicitly given \"Moderating Powers\" rather than executive power. Elsewhere (for example, the 1848 \"Statuto albertino\" of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which later became the basis of the Italian constitution from 1861) the executive power was notionally vested in the King, but was exercisable only by the responsible ministers.\n\nHe defended the separation of powers as basis of a liberal State, but unlike Montesquieu and most of the liberal thinkers, he defended five powers instead of three. They were the Regal or Moderator, the Executive, the Representative Power of Opinion, the Representative Power of Tradition and the Judicial, the Moderator Power was a monarch, a type judge that was not part of the government, but served as a neutral power to the government, the Executive Power was the ministers that the monarch appointed and they were, collectively, the head of government, the Representative Powers were a separation of the Monstesquieu´s Legislative Power, with the Representative Power of Opinion being an elected body to represent the opinion of the citizens and the Representative Power of Tradition was an hereditary House of Peers and the judicial was similar to the Montesquieu's Judicial Power.\n\nConstant's other concerns included a \"new type of federalism\": a serious attempt to decentralize French government through the devolution of powers to elected municipal councils. This proposal reached fruition in 1831, when elected municipal councils (albeit on a narrow franchise) were created.\n\nThe importance of Constant's writings on the liberty of the ancients has dominated understanding of his work. His wider literary and cultural writings (most importantly the novella \"Adolphe\" and his extensive histories of religion) emphasized the importance of self-sacrifice and warmth of the human emotions as a basis for social living. Thus, while he pleaded for individual liberty as vital for individual moral development and appropriate for modernity, he felt that egoism and self-interest were insufficient as part of a true definition of individual liberty. Emotional authenticity and fellow-feeling were critical. In this, his moral and religious thought was strongly influenced by the moral writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and German thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, whom he read in preparing his religious history.\n\nConstant published only one novel during his lifetime, \"Adolphe\" (1816), the story of a young, indecisive man's disastrous love affair with an older mistress. A first-person novel in the sentimentalist tradition, \"Adolphe\" examines the thoughts of the young man as he falls in and out of love with Ellenore, a woman of uncertain virtue. Constant began the novel as an autobiographical tale of two loves, but decided that the reading public would object to serial passions. The love affair depicted in the finished version of the novel is thought to be based on Constant's affair with Anna Lindsay, who describes the affair in her correspondence (published in the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\", December 1930 – January 1931). The book has been compared to Chateaubriand's \"René\" or Mme de Stael's \"Corinne\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Such traits attract the attention of evolutionary biologists. Several human traits pose challenges to evolutionary thinking, as they are relatively prevalent but are associated with lower reproductive success through reduced fertility and/or longevity. Some of the classic examples include: left handedness, menopause, and mental disorders. These traits are also found in animals, a peacock shows an example of a trait that may reduce its fitness. The bigger the tail, the easier it is seen by predators and it also may hinder the movement of the peacock. Darwin, in fact, solved this \"puzzle\" by explaining the peacock's tail as evidence of sexual selection; a bigger tail confers evolutionary fitness on the male by allowing it to attract more females than other males with shorter tails. The phrase \"Darwinian puzzle\" itself is rare and of unclear origin; it's typically talked about in the context of Animal Behavior.\n\nDarwinian puzzles are evident in nature, even though it appears to reduce the fitness of the individual that possesses it. Different individuals use the odd phenomenon in particular ways such as toxins, fitness demonstration, and mimicry.\n\nThere are a few contributing factors in biology which may affect Darwinian puzzles.\nThis may be based on common descent. Animals may share 1/4, 1/2, or even in some cases all of their genes with others. Identical twins have a coefficient of relatedness of r=1. Full siblings have a coefficient of relatedness of r=.50, and half siblings and first cousins have a coefficient of relatedness of r=.25. Depending on how related two animals are, they may be more likely to act altruistically to one another. Even if it is of no benefit to themselves, it helps to promote survival of at least some of their genes as they are shared with others closely related to them. The formula to calculate coefficient of relatedness is (R) = Σ (1/2)\nHamilton's rule is often used to explain altruism in populations based upon relatedness. It can be represented by the formula (rB > C) where r represents relatedness, B represents benefit to the recipient, and C represents cost to the altruist. Animals may use Hamilton's rule in many instances where it will not promote their own fitness, but will have an evolutionary effect on the overall fitness of the species in general.\n\nThe following phenomena are sometimes called Darwinian puzzles:\n\n"}

The concept may be used for any act of killing a god, including a life-death-rebirth deity who is killed and then resurrected.\n\nThe term deicide was coined in the 17th century from medieval Latin \"*deicidium\", from \"de-us\" \"god\" and \"-cidium\" \"cutting, killing.\"\n\nAccording to the New Testament accounts, the Judean (or Jewish) authorities in Jerusalem, the Pharisees, charged Jesus with blasphemy, a capital crime under biblical law, and sought his execution. According to , the Judean (Jewish) authorities claimed to lack the authority to have Jesus put to death, though it is doubtful what legal basis such a claim would have had; the Jesus Seminar historicity project notes for : \"\"it's illegal for us:\" The accuracy of this claim is doubtful.\" in their \"Scholars Version\". Additionally, records them asking Jesus about stoning the adulteress and records them ordering the stoning of Saint Stephen.\n\nThey brought Jesus to Pontius Pilate, the Roman Prefect of Judea, who was hesitant and let the people decide if Jesus were to be executed. According to the Bible, Pontius Pilate only ordered Jesus to be flogged. Washing his hands, Pilate said he would not take the blame for Jesus' death, to which the crowd replied, \"His blood is upon us and our children.\"\n\nPilate is portrayed in the Gospel accounts as a reluctant accomplice to Jesus' death. Modern scholars say it is most likely that a Roman Governor such as Pilate would have no problem in executing any leader whose followers posed a potential threat to Roman rule. It has also been suggested that the Gospel accounts may have downplayed the role of the Romans in Jesus' death during a time when Christianity was struggling to gain acceptance in the Roman world.\n\nThe Catholic Church and other Christian denominations suggest that Jesus' death was necessary to take away the collective sin of the human race. The crucifixion is seen as an example of Christ's eternal love for mankind and as a self-sacrifice on the part of God for humanity.\n\nThe Gnostic Gospel of Judas contends that Jesus commanded Judas Iscariot to set in motion the chain of events that would lead to his death.\n\nThe following is a verse from a hymn written in 1892 for use in the Church of England to call upon God to convert the Jews to Christianity:\n\nAgainst certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of Hebrew Scripture, Augustine countered that God had chosen the Jews as a special people, and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy. He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely \"Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law\" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at \"the end of time\", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands. The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews \"survive but not thrive\" (it is repeated by author James Carroll in his book \"Constantine's Sword\", for example) is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1912360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1912360", "title": "Face (sociological concept)", "text": "Face (sociological concept)\n\nThe term face idiomatically refers to one's own sense of self-image, dignity or prestige in social contexts. In the English-speaking world and the West, the expression \"to save face\" describes the lengths that an individual may go to in order to preserve their established position in society, taking action to ensure that one is not thought badly of by his or her peers. It is a fundamental concept in the fields of sociology, sociolinguistics, semantics, politeness theory, psychology, political science, communication, and face negotiation theory, and translates at least somewhat equivalently into many world languages, both Germanic and otherwise.\n\nAlthough Chinese writer Lin Yutang claimed \"Face cannot be translated or defined\", compare these definitions:\n\n\n\"The concept of face is, of course, Chinese in origin\", yet many languages have \"face\" terms that metaphorically mean \"prestige; honor; reputation\". The French sociologist Marcel Mauss, who sociologically studied the Kwakwaka'wakw (formerly known as Kwakiutl) and Haida nations in British Columbia, Canada interpreted the Kwak'wala word \"q'elsem\" (\"rotten face\") meaning \"stingy potlatch-giver; one who gives no feast\".\nKwakiutl and Haida noblemen have the same notion of \"face\" as the Chinese mandarin or officer. It is said of one of the great mythical chiefs who gave no feast that he had a \"rotten face\". The expression is more apt than it is even in China; for to lose one's face is to lose one's spirit, which is truly the \"face\", the dancing mask, the right to incarnate a spirit and wear an emblem or totem. It is the veritable \"persona\" which is at stake, and it can be lost in the potlatch just as it can be lost in the game of gift-giving, in war, or through some error in ritual. (1954:38) Michael Carr (1992, 1993) lexicographically investigated \"face; prestige\" dictionary forms in Chinese, Japanese, and English. Within this sample, Chinese dictionaries include 98 forms, e.g., \"sipo lian\" 撕破臉 (\"rip up face\") \"have no consideration for someone's feelings\"; Japanese dictionaries list 89, e.g., \"kao o uru\" 顔を売る (\"sell face\") \"become popular; gain influence\"; and English dictionaries include 5 forms, e.g., \"lose face\" (borrowed from Chinese \"diulian\" 丟臉 \"lose face\"). Carr found that the Chinese and Japanese lexicons have roughly equal numbers of words for \"losing face\" and \"saving face\", while English has more for \"saving face\".\n\nTwo influential Chinese authors explained \"face\". The Chinese writer Lu Xun referred to the American missionary Arthur Henderson Smith's (1894:16–18) interpretation.\nThe term \"face\" keeps cropping up in our conversation, and it seems such a simple expression that I doubt whether many people give it much thought. Recently, however, we have heard this word on the lips of foreigners too, who seem to be studying it. They find it extremely hard to understand, but believe that \"face\" is the key to the Chinese spirit and that grasping it will be like grabbing a queue twenty-four years ago [when wearing a queue was compulsory] – everything else will follow. (1934, 1959:129) \nLin Yutang considered the psychology of \"face\".\nInteresting as the Chinese physiological face is, the psychological face makes a still more fascinating study. It is not a face that can be washed or shaved, but a face that can be \"granted\" and \"lost\" and \"fought for\" and \"presented as a gift\". Here we arrive at the most curious point of Chinese social psychology. Abstract and intangible, it is yet the most delicate standard by which Chinese social intercourse is regulated. \nLin refers to \"liú miànzi\" 留面子 \"grant face; give (someone) a chance to regain lost honor\", \"shī miànzi\" 失面子 \"lose face\", \"zhēng miànzi\" 爭面子 \"fight for face; keeping up with the Joneses\", and \"gěi miànzi\" 給面子 \"give face; show respect (for someone's feelings)\".\n\nThe Chinese language has three common words meaning \"face\":\n\n\nMiàn 面 \"face; personal esteem; countenance; surface; side\" occurs in words like:\n\n\n\"Miànmù\", which occurs in the \"Shijing\", \"Guanzi\", and other Chinese classics, is the oldest Chinese word for figurative \"face\" (Carr 1992:43). David Yau-fai Ho (1974:241) describes \"tǐmiàn\" as \"an expression without an exact equivalent in English\", meaning \"the social front, the ostensible display of one's social standing to the public. It is both a prerogative and an implicit obligation for the socially prominent to be particular about.\" \"Miànzi\" is a measurable and quantifiable concept of \"face\". Face, Hsien-chin Hu says,\ncan be borrowed, struggled for, added to, padded, — all terms indicating a gradual increase in volume. It is built up through initial high position, wealth, power, ability, through cleverly establishing social ties to a number of prominent people, as well as through avoidance of acts that would cause unfavorable comment. (1944:61) \n\nLiǎn 臉 \"face; countenance; respect; reputation; prestige\" is seen in several \"face\" words:\n\n\nWhile the use of the word \"\"miàn\" is more common outside Mainland China, in China PRC, it is the word \"liǎn\"\" 臉 that is more commonly used.\n\nHu (1944:51-52) contrasts \"méiyǒu liǎn\" 沒有臉 (\"without face\") \"audacious; wanton; shameless\" as \"the most severe condemnation that can be made of a person\" and \"bùyào liǎn\" 不要臉 (\"don't want face\") \"shameless; selfishly inconsiderate\" as \"a serious accusation meaning that ego does not care what society thinks of his character, that he is ready to obtain benefits for himself in defiance of moral standards\".\n\nNote that Cantonese uses 面 instead of 臉. However, Chinese people generally use the term 臉子 more commonly when speaking in Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua).\n\nYán 顏 \"face; prestige; reputation; honor\" occurs in the common expression \"diū yán\" 丟顏 and the words:\n\n\nChinese uses \"yán\" less often in expressing \"face; prestige\" than either \"miàn\" or \"liǎn\".\n\nCarr (1992:58–60) summarizes four common Chinese lexical patterns for \"face\" words. First, the lexicon antithetically modifies all three \"face\" words with \"hòu\" 厚 \"thick; deep; great\" and \"báo\" or \"bó\" 薄 \"thin; slight; weak\" to describe \"(in)sensitivity to prestige\", for example, \"miànpí hòu\" 面皮厚 \"thick-skinned; shameless\" and \"miànpí báo\" 面皮薄 \"thin-skinned; diffident\". Second, owing to the importance of the visible face, \"kàn\" 看 \"see; look\" meaning \"have consideration for\" and \"bùhǎokàn\" 不好看 \"not good looking\" describe \"face\". Third, several expressions reciprocally describe \"yǒu\" 有 \"having\" or \"méiyǒu\" 沒有 \"not having\" \"face\", such as \"dàjiā yǒu miànzi\" 大家沒有面子 \"everybody has mutual honor\" and \"méiyǒu miànzi\" \"lacking prestige\". Fourth, \"losing face\" can be expressed with the common \"lose\" verb \"shī\" 失 and the rarer \"diū\" 丟, for instance, \"shī miànzi\" 失面子 and \"diū miànzi\" 丟面子 \"lose face; lose prestige\".\n\nRecent studies of Chinese \"face\" have principally accepted Hu Hsien-chin's original distinction between a person's \"miànzi\" \"social status\" and \"lián\" \"moral character\". dichotomized \"miànzi\" as \"a reputation achieved through getting on in life, through success and ostentation\" versus \"liǎn\" which \"represents the confidence of society in the integrity of ego's moral character, the loss of which makes it impossible for him to function properly within the community\". Ho qualified this dichotomy:\nalthough the distinction between the two sets of criteria for judging face – based on judgments of character and, broadly, of the amoral aspects of social performance – is justified, it cannot be anchored to a linguistic distinction between the two terms, \"lien\" and \"mien-tzu\", as proposed by Hu. However, we may continue to use these terms in the senses that Hu has defined.\nOn the basis of experiments showing that Chinese high school students defined losses of \"miànzi\" and \"liǎn\" interchangeably, while university students distinguished them, Huang Shuanfan concluded that:\nSuccinctly, among college subjects, loss of \"mianzi\" is more definitely tied to failure to measure up to one's sense of self-esteem or to what is expected by others, whereas loss of \"lian\" is closely tied to transgression of social codes. Hu's (1944) forty-year-old distinction between the two Chinese concepts of faces appears to stand very well, even today. (1987:73) \n\"Liǎn\" is the confidence of society in a person's moral character, while \"miànzi\" represents social perceptions of a person's prestige. For a person to maintain face is important with Chinese social relations because face translates into power and influence and affects goodwill. A loss of \"lian\" would result in a loss of trust within a social network, while a loss of \"miànzi\" would likely result in a loss of authority.\n\nTwo \"face\"-related concepts in Chinese social relations are \"guānxi\" 關係 (\"connections; relationships\") and gǎnqíng 感情 (\"feelings\") .\n\nThe English semantic field for \"face\" words meaning \"prestige; honor\" is smaller than the corresponding Chinese field, but historical dictionaries more accurately record its history. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (2nd ed., 1989) documents how the English community in China originated \"lose face\" and \"save face\" in the late 19th century, and how morphological variants like \"face-saver\" subsequently developed.\n\n\"Lose face\" is a linguistic calque from Chinese \"diūliǎn\" 丟臉 \"lose face\". The \"OED2\" Face 10 definition distinguishes meanings between native 10a. \"Outward show; assumed or factitious appearance; disguise, pretence; an instance of this; a pretext\" (for instance, \"to put a good face on\") and borrowed:\n10b. to save one's face: see save v. 8f; also to save face; to lose face [tr. Chinese \"diu lien\"]: to be humiliated, lose one's credit, good name, or reputation; similarly, loss of face. Hence \"face\" = reputation, good name. \nRobert Hart originally translated \"lose face\" in a January 23, 1876 Zongli Yamen customs memorandum, \"The Inspector General's Memorandum Concerning Commercial Relations\" (Appendix II in Hart 1901:182-251).\nThe country begins to feel that Government consented to arrangements by which China has lost face; the officials have long been conscious that they are becoming ridiculous in the eyes of the people, seeing that where a foreigner is concerned they can neither enforce a Chinese right, nor redress a Chinese grievance, even on Chinese soil. (1901:225)\n\"Loss of face\" occurs in \"The Times\" (August 3, 1929): \"Each wishes to concede only what can be conceded without loss of 'face'.\"\n\n\"\" was coined from \"lose face\" applying the semantic opposition between \"\" and \"\" [tr. Chinese \"保面子／bǎo miànzi／guard/save face\"; when successful, it's called \"保住面子／bǎozhu miànzi /saved/guarded face \"].\n\n\"OED\" defines Save 8 \"To keep, protect or guard (a thing) from damage, loss, or destruction\", and elaborates,\n8f. to save one's face: to avoid being disgraced or humiliated. Similarly, to save (another's) face. Hence save-face adj. = \"face-saving\" … Originally used by the English community in China, with reference to the continual devices among the Chinese to avoid incurring or inflicting disgrace. The exact phrase appears not to occur in Chinese, but ‘to lose face’ (\"diu lien\"), and ‘for the sake of his face’, are common. \nFor the earliest usage examples, the \"OED\" gives the following. \"Save one's face\" is recorded in the \"Westminster Gazette\" (April 5, 1898): \"Unquestionably the process of saving one's face leads to curious results in other countries than China.\" \"Save-face\" is found in \"Chambers Journal of Literature, Science and Arts\" (1917): \"The civilian native staff had bolted at the first sign of trouble, 'going to report to the authorities' being their 'save face' for it!\" \"Face-saving\" first appears in Enoch A. Bennett's \"Lilian\" (1922): \"She had been trapped beyond any chance of a face-saving lie.\" \"Face-saver\", defined as \"something that 'saves one's face', \" originated in Edgar Snow's \"Scorched Earth\" (1941): \"As a face-saver, however, Doihara was given enough support, from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria.\" Carr (1993:74) notes, \"It is significant that the earliest usages for English \"lose face\", \"save face\", \"save-face\" and \"face-saver\" refer to China, while later ones are more international in application.\"\n\nBy expanding \"lose face\" into \"save face\", English developed oppositely from Chinese, which has many \"lose face\" collocations, but none literally meaning \"save face\". \"Yào miànzi\" 要面子 \"eager to gain reputation; be concerned about appearances\" is (Hu 1944:58) \"the closest Chinese approximation\" for \"save face\".\n\nThe underlying reason for this difference is that English \"face\" lacks the sociological contrast between Chinese \"liǎn\" and \"miànzi\". Since Chinese \"liǎn\" is ethically absolute while \"miànzi\" is socially quantitative, losing the former is more significant. According to Huang:\nThe fact that Chinese lexicalizes losing face (丟臉, 沒面子), but not gaining face is a potent reminder that losing face has far more serious implications for one's sense of self-esteem or decency than gaining face. (1987:71) \nHo explains how \"losing\" one's \"face\" is more sociodynamically significant than \"saving\" it. Previous writers on face have treated losing face and gaining face simply as if they were opposite outcomes in a social encounter and have thus failed to notice the basic difference between two social processes that are involved. In the first instance, while it is meaningful to speak of both losing and gaining \"mien-tzu\" it is meaningful to speak only of losing \"lien\". One does not speak of gaining \"lien\" because, regardless of one's station in life, one is expected to behave in accordance with the precepts of the culture; correctly conceptualized, exemplary conduct adds not to one's \"lien\", but to one's \"mien-tzu\". (1975:870) \n\"Losing face\" brings into question one's moral decency and societal adequacy, but not \"gaining face\".\n\nThe \"lose\" verb in \"lose face\" means \"fail to maintain\" (cf. \"lose one's life\"), while the \"save\" in \"save face\" means \"avoid loss/damage\" (cf. \"save one's honor\"). \"The English creation of \"save face\" as the opposite of \"lose face\" was arbitrary because \"lose\" has other antonyms: \"win\", \"find\", \"keep\", \"catch\", \"maintain\", \"preserve\", \"gain\", and \"regain\"\", Carr (1993:77) notes, \"Speakers occasionally use the last three (esp. \"gain\") regarding \"face\" 'prestige', though less frequently than \"save\"\". Another usage example is \"\", which is included in the Wiktionary but not the \"OED2\".\n\nAmong the English words of Chinese origin, \"lose face\" is an uncommon verb phrase and a unique semantic loan translation. Most Anglo-Chinese borrowings are nouns (Yuan 1981:250), with a few exceptions such as \"to kowtow\", \"to Shanghai\", \"to brainwash\", and \"lose face\". English \"face\" meaning \"prestige; honor\" is the only case of a Chinese semantic loan. Semantic loans extend an indigenous word's meaning in conformity with a foreign model (e.g., French \"realiser\" \"achieve; create; construct\" used in the sense of English \"realize\"). The vast majority of English words from Chinese are ordinary loanwords with regular phonemic adaptation (e.g., \"chop suey\" < Cantonese \"tsap-sui\" \"miscellaneous pieces\"). A few are calques where a borrowing is blended with native elements (e.g., \"chopsticks\" < Pidgin \"chop\" \"quick, fast\" < Cantonese \"kap\" \"quick\" + \"stick\"). \"Face\" meaning \"prestige\" is technically a \"loan synonym\" owing to semantic overlap between the native English meaning \"outward semblance; effrontery\" and the borrowed Chinese meaning \"prestige; dignity\".\n\nJohn Orr (1953) coined the term \"invisible exports\" to describe how French \"forme\", \"ouverte\", and \"courir\" borrowed the sports meanings of English \"form\", \"open\", and \"run\". Chinese \"lose face\" is an imperceptible English import because it appears to be a predictable semantic extension of \"face\", and not a noticeable foreign borrowing. This invisible \"face\" \"prestige; status\" loan is, Chan and Kwok (1985:60) explain, \"so firmly established in the English vocabulary that the average native speaker is unaware of its Chinese origin.\"\n\nWhen \"face\" acquired its Chinese sense of \"prestige; honor\", it filled a lexical gap in the English lexicon. Chan and Kwok write,\nThe Chinese has supplied a specific \"name\" for a \"thing\" embodying qualities not expressed or possibly not fully expressed, by a number of terms in English. The aptness of the figurative extension has probably also played a part (1985:61-62). \nCarr concludes,\nThe nearest English synonyms of the apt figurative \"face\" are \"prestige\", \"honor\", \"respect\", \"dignity\", \"status\", \"reputation\", \"social acceptance\", or \"good name\". explains how \"face\" is a more basic meaning than \"status\", \"dignity\", or \"honor\". \"Prestige\" appears to be semantically closest to \"face\", however a person can be said to have \"face\" but not \"prestige\", or vice versa. Prestige is not necessary; one can easily live without it, but hardly without \"face\".\n\nIn Arabic, the expression \"hafiẓa māʼ al-wajh\" (), which literally translate as \"save the face's water\", is used to mean \"save face\". The entire Arab culture of social and family behavior is based around Islamic concepts of dignity, or \"Face\", which has its basis in the social and family ranking system found in the Treatise of Rights, Al-Risalah al-Huquq, Islam's primary source for social behaviors.\n\nIn Persian, expressions like \"Aab ro rizi\" () literally - \"losing the face's water\", is used to mean \"save face\" and \"Dou roi\" () (lit. two-facedness), \"Ro seyahi \"() (lit. Black-facedness) meaning \"ashamed and embarrassed\" and \"Ro sepidi\" () (lit. White-facedness) meaning \"proud\" (opposite of Ro seyahi) are used.\n\nIn Iranian culture the meaning of linguistic face is much closer to the meaning of \"Personality\". So Persian speakers use some strategies in saving the face or personality of each other while they communicate. The most frequent way to express face saving act is the application of first person plural pronoun \" instead of first person singular \". The other common way of expressing care about the face, is the indirectenss. Instead of saying \" (pass me the salt) one can say \" (Can I ask you to pass me the salt?)\n\nThe entire Iranian culture of social and family behavior is based around Islamic concepts of dignity, or \"Face\", which has its basis in the social and family ranking system found in The Treatise of Rights, Al-Risalah al-Huquq, Islam's primary source for social behaviors. \"To Ask, Listen, Know\" is how Irani children learn this concept.\n\nAmong South Slavs, especially in Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian, the word \"obraz\" (Cyrillic: образ) is used as a traditional expression for honor and the sociological concept of face. Medieval Slavic documents have shown that the word has been used with various meanings, such as form, image, character, person, symbol, face, figure, statue, idol, guise and mask. The languages also have a derived adjective \"bezobrazan\" (Cyrillic: безобразен) \"without face\", used to associate shame to a person.\n\nThe Thai word for face is หน้า, meaning literally face. There are basically two main ways of expressing loss of face. One, เสียหน้า, [sia naa] translates literally as 'lose face.' Another term, ขายหน้า, or [khai naa], means sale of face - actual connotation is that the person who lost face did so through fault of self or through the thoughtless action of another. As in China and other regions where loss of face is important, the Thai version involves sociodynamic status.\n\nThe concept of \"face\" or \"chemyon\" ( , ) is extremely important in Korean culture.\n\nFigurative \"face\" meaning \"prestige; honor; dignity\" is applied across many academic disciplines.\n\n\"Face\" is central to sociology and sociolinguistics. Martin C. Yang analyzed eight sociological factors in losing or gaining face: the kinds of equality between the people involved, their ages, personal sensibilities, inequality in social status, social relationship, consciousness of personal prestige, presence of a witness, and the particular social value/sanction involved.\n\nThe sociologist Erving Goffman introduced the concept of \"face\" into social theory with his (1955) article \"On Face-work: An Analysis of Ritual Elements of Social Interaction\" and (1967) book \"Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior\". According to Goffman's dramaturgical perspective, face is a mask that changes depending on the audience and the variety of social interaction. People strive to maintain the face they have created in social situations. They are emotionally attached to their faces, so they feel good when their faces are maintained; loss of face results in emotional pain, so in social interactions people cooperate by using politeness strategies to maintain each other's faces.\n\n\"Face\" is sociologically universal. People \"are human\", Joseph Agassi and I. C. Jarvie (1969:140) believe, \"because they have face to care for – without it they lose human dignity.\" Ho elaborates:\nThe point is that face is distinctively human. Anyone who does not wish to declare his social bankruptcy must show a regard for face: he must claim for himself, and must extend to others, some degree of compliance, respect, and deference in order to maintain a minimum level of effective social functioning. While it is true that the conceptualization of what constitutes face and the rules governing face behavior vary considerably across cultures, the concern for face is invariant. Defined at a high level of generality, the concept of face is a universal.\nThe sociological concept of face has recently been reanalysed through consideration of the Chinese concepts of face (mianzi and lian) which permits deeper understanding of the various dimensions of experience of face, including moral and social evaluation, and its emotional mechanisms.\n\nAccording to Hu (1944), mianzi stands for 'the kind of prestige that is emphasized…a reputation achieved through getting on in life, through success and ostentation', while face is 'the respect of a group for a man with a good moral reputation: the man who will fulfill his obligations regardless of the hardships involved, who under all circumstances shows himself a decent human being'. The concept seems to relate to two different meanings, from one side Chinese consumers try to increase or maintain their reputation (mianzi) in front of socially and culturally significant others (e.g. friends); on the other hand, they try to defend or save face.\n\nMianzi is not only important to improve the consumer’s reputation in front of significant others, but rather it is also associated with feelings of dignity, honor, and pride. In consumer behaviour literature, mianzi has been used to explain Chinese consumer purchasing behaviour and brand choice and considered it as a ‘quality’ owned by some brands. Some consumers tend to favour some brands (and their products and services) because of their capacity to enable them to 'gain' mianzi, which does not mean simply increase their reputation but also to show achievements and communicate these achievements to others in order to be more accepted in social circles, especially upper class circles. Chinese consumers tend to believe that if they buy some brands it is easier to be accepted in the social circles of powerful and wealthy people. Connections are particularly important in Chinese culture as people use social connections to achieve their goals.\n\nHowever, mianzi has also an emotional facet. Consumer feel proud, special, honoured, even more valuable as individuals if they can afford to buy brands that can enhance their mainzi. Therefore, some branded products and services, especially those that require conspicuous consumption (e.g. smartphones, bags, shoes), are chosen because they foster feelings of pride and vanity in the owner.\n\nA brand that enables an individual to achieve such goals in life, in branding literature, it is labelled as 'brand mianzi', which is the capacity of a brand to provide emotions and self-enhancement to its owner.\nScholars have proved that brand mianzi affects consumer purchase intentions and brand equity.\n\nIn summary, mianzi is a cultural concept that relates to the social, emotional and psychological dimension of consumption and has an impact on consumers’ perception of their self and purchase decisions. Purchase and consumption of brands (but also other activities, like choosing a specific university), in Chinese culture, are profoundly affected by mianzi and different brands can be more or less apt to enhance or maintain mianzi, while others can cause a loss of face.\n\nPenelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson (1987) expanded Goffman's theory of face in their politeness theory, which differentiated between positive and negative face.\n\n\nIn human interactions, people are often forced to threaten either an addressee's positive and/or negative face, and so there are various politeness strategies to mitigate those face-threatening acts.\n\nTae-Seop Lim and John Waite Bowers (1991) claim that face is the public image that a person claims for himself. Within this claim there are three dimensions. \"\"Autonomy face\" describes a desire to appear independent, in control, and responsible. \"Fellowship face\" describes a desire to seem cooperative, accepted, and loved. \"Competence face\"\" describes a desire to appear intelligent, accomplished, and capable.\n\nOetzel et al (2000) defined \"facework\" as \"the communicative strategies one uses to enact self-face and to uphold, support, or challenge another person's face\". In terms of interpersonal communication, Facework refers to an individual’s identity in a social world and how that identity is created, reinforced, diminished, and maintained in communicative interactions.\n\nFace is central to intercultural communication or cross-cultural communication. Bert Brown explains the importance of both personal and national face in international negotiations:\nAmong the most troublesome kinds of problems that arise in negotiation are the intangible issues related to loss of face. In some instances, protecting against loss of face becomes so central an issue that it swamps the importance of the tangible issues at stake and generates intense conflicts that can impede progress toward agreement and increase substantially the costs of conflict resolution. (1977:275) \n\nIn terms of Edward T. Hall's dichotomy between high context cultures focused upon in-groups and low context cultures focused upon individuals, face-saving is generally viewed as more important in high context cultures such as China or Japan than in low-context ones such as the United States or Germany.\n\nStella Ting-Toomey developed Face Negotiation Theory to explain cultural differences in communication and conflict resolution. Ting-Toomey defines face as\nthe interaction between the degree of threats or considerations one party offers to another party, and the degree of claim for a sense of self-respect (or demand for respect toward one's national image or cultural group) put forth by the other party in a given situation. (1990) \n\nThe psychology of \"face\" is another field of research. Wolfram Eberhard, who analyzed Chinese \"guilt\" and \"sin\" in terms of literary psychology, debunked the persistent myth that \"face\" is peculiar to the Chinese rather than a force in every human society. Eberhard noted\nIt is mainly in the writings of foreigners that we find the stress upon shame in Chinese society; it is they who stated that the Chinese were typically afraid of \"losing their face\". It is they who reported many cases of suicide because of loss of face, or of suicide in order to punish another person after one's death as a ghost, or to cause through suicide endless difficulties or even punishment to the other person. But in the Chinese literature used here, including also the short stories, I did not once find the phrase \"losing face\"; and there was no clear case of suicide because of shame alone. (1967:119-120) \n\nThe Chinese University of Hong Kong social psychologist Michael Harris Bond observed that in Hong Kong,\nGiven the importance of having face and of being related to those who do, there is a plethora of relationship politics in Chinese culture. Name dropping, eagerness to associate with the rich and famous, the use of external status symbols, sensitivity to insult, lavish gift-giving, the use of titles, the sedulous avoidance of criticism, all abound, and require considerable readjustment for someone used to organizing social life by impersonal rules, frankness, and greater equality. (1991:59)\n\n\"Face\" has further applications in political science. For instance, Susan Pharr (1989) stressed the importance of \"losing face\" in Japanese comparative politics.\n\nLinguists have analyzed the semantics of \"face\". Huang (1985, cited above) used prototype semantics to differentiate \"lian\" and \"mianzi\". George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's \"Metaphors We Live By\" (1980:37) emphasizes \"the face for the person\" metonymy. Keith Allan (1986) extended \"face\" into theoretical semantics. He postulated it to be an essential element of all language interchanges, and claimed: \"A satisfactory theory of linguistic meaning cannot ignore questions of face presentation, nor other politeness phenomena that maintain the co-operative nature of language interchange.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "154331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154331", "title": "Gregory Bateson", "text": "Gregory Bateson\n\nGregory Bateson (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician, and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields. In the 1940s, he helped extend systems theory and cybernetics to the social and behavioral sciences. He spent the last decade of his life developing a \"meta-science\" of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in different fields of science. His writings include \"Steps to an Ecology of Mind\" (1972) and \"Mind and Nature\" (1979). \"Angels Fear\" (published posthumously in 1987) was co-authored by his daughter Mary Catherine Bateson.\n\nBateson was born in Grantchester in Cambridgeshire, England, on 9 May 1904. He was the third and youngest son of (Caroline) Beatrice Durham and the distinguished geneticist William Bateson. He was named Gregory after Gregor Mendel, the Austrian monk who founded the modern science of genetics.\n\nThe younger Bateson attended Charterhouse School from 1917 to 1921, obtained a Bachelor of Arts in biology at St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1925, and continued at Cambridge from 1927 to 1929. Bateson lectured in linguistics at the University of Sydney in 1928. From 1931 to 1937, he was a Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, spent the years before World War II in the South Pacific in New Guinea and Bali doing anthropology. During 1936–1950, he was married to Margaret Mead. At that time he applied his knowledge to the war effort before moving to the United States.\n\nIn Palo Alto, California, Bateson and his colleagues Donald Jackson, Jay Haley and John H. Weakland developed the double-bind theory (see also \"Bateson Project\").\n\nBateson's interest in systems theory and cybernetics forms a thread running through his work. He was one of the original members of the core group of the Macy conferences in Cybernetics, and the later set on Group Processes, where he represented the social and behavioral sciences. Bateson was interested in the relationship of these fields to epistemology. His association with the editor and author Stewart Brand helped to widen his influence. From the 1970s until his last years, a broader audience of university students and educated people working in many fields came to know his thought.\n\nIn 1956, he became a naturalised citizen of the United States. Bateson was a member of William Irwin Thompson's Lindisfarne Association. In the 1970s, he taught at the Humanistic Psychology Institute (renamed the Saybrook University) in San Francisco; and in 1972 joined the faculty of Kresge College at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. In 1976, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Bateson to the Regents of the University of California, in which position he served until his death (although he resigned from the Special Research Projects committee in 1979, in opposition to the university's work on nuclear weapons). He died on Independence Day, 1980, in the guest house of the San Francisco Zen Center.\n\nBateson's life, according to Lipset (1982), was greatly affected by the death of his two brothers. John Bateson (1898–1918), the eldest of the three, was killed in World War I. Martin Bateson (1900–1922), the second brother, was then expected to follow in his father's footsteps as a scientist, but came into conflict with his father over his ambition to become a poet and playwright. The resulting stress, combined with a disappointment in love, resulted in Martin's public suicide by gunshot under the statue of Anteros in Piccadilly Circus on 22 April 1922, which was John's birthday. After this event, which transformed a private family tragedy into public scandal, all William and Beatrice's ambitious expectations fell on Gregory, their only surviving son.\n\nBateson's first marriage, in 1936, was to American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead. Bateson and Mead had a daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson (born 1939), who also became an anthropologist. Bateson separated from Mead in 1947, and they were divorced in 1950. In 1951 he married his second wife Elizabeth \"Betty\" Sumner (1919–1992), the daughter of the Episcopalian Bishop of Oregon, Walter Taylor Sumner. They had a son, John Sumner Bateson (1951-2015), as well as twins who died shortly after birth in 1953. Bateson and Sumner were divorced in 1957, after which Bateson married his third wife, the therapist and social worker Lois Cammack (born 1928), in 1961. They had one daughter, Nora Bateson (born 1969).\n\nBateson was a lifelong atheist, as his family had been for several generations.\n\nThe 2014 novel \"Euphoria\" by Lily King is a fictionalized account of Bateson's relationships with Mead and Reo Fortune in pre-WWII New Guinea.\n\nWhere others might see a set of inexplicable details, Bateson perceived simple relationships. In \"From Versailles to Cybernetics,\" Bateson argues that the history of the twentieth century can be perceived as the history of a malfunctioning relationship. In his view, the Treaty of Versailles exemplifies a whole pattern of human relationships based on betrayal and hate. He therefore claims that the treaty of Versailles and the development of cybernetics—which for him represented the possibility of \"improved\" relationships—are the only two anthropologically important events of the twentieth century.\n\nAlthough initially reluctant to join the intelligence services, Bateson served in OSS during World War II along with dozens of other anthropologists. He was stationed in the same offices as Julia Child (then Julia McWilliams), Paul Cushing Child, and others. He spent much of the war designing 'black propaganda' radio broadcasts. He was deployed on covert operations in Burma and Thailand, and worked in China, India, and Ceylon as well. Bateson used his theory of schismogenesis to help foster discord among enemy fighters. He was upset by his wartime experience and disagreed with his wife over whether science should be applied to social planning or used only to foster understanding rather than action.\n\nBateson's beginning years as an anthropologist were spent floundering, lost without a specific objective in mind. He began first with a trip to New Guinea, spurred by mentor A. C. Haddon. His goal, as suggested by Haddon, was to explore the effects of contact between the Sepik natives and whites. Unfortunately for Bateson, his time spent with the Baining of New Guinea was halted and difficult. The Baining turned out to be secretive and excluded him from many aspects of their society. On more than one occasion he was tricked into missing communal activities, and they held out on their religion. He left them, frustrated. He next studied the Sulka, another native population of New Guinea. Although the Sulka were dramatically different from the Baining and their culture much more \"visible\" to the observer, he felt their culture was dying, which left him feeling dispirited and discouraged.\n\nHe experienced more success with the Iatmul people, another indigenous people of the Sepik River region of New Guinea. He would always return to the idea of communications and relations or interactions between and among people. The observations he made of the Iatmul allowed him to develop his concept of schismogenesis. He studied the 'naven', an honorific ceremony among the Iatmul, still continued today, that celebrates first-time cultural achievements. The ceremony entails many antics that are normally forbidden during everyday social life. For example, men and women reverse and exaggerate gender roles; men dress in women's skirts, and women dress in men's attire and ornaments. Additionally, certain categories of female kin smear mud in the faces of other relatives, beat them with sticks, and hurl bawdy insults. Mothers may drop to the ground so their celebrated 'child' walks over them. And during a male rite, a mother's brother may slide his buttocks down the leg of his honoured sister's son, a complex gesture of masculine birthing, pride, and insult, rarely performed before women, that brings the honoured sister's son to tears. Bateson suggested the influence of a circular system of causation, and proposed that:\n\nWomen watched for the spectacular performances of the men, and there can be no reasonable doubt that the presence of an audience is a very important factor in shaping the men's behavior. In fact, it is probable that the men are more exhibitionistic because the women admire their performances. Conversely, there can be no doubt that the spectacular behavior is a stimulus which summons the audience together, promoting in the women the appropriate behavior.\n\nIn short, the behaviour of person X affects person Y, and the reaction of person Y to person X's behaviour will then affect person X's behaviour, which in turn will affect person Y, and so on. Bateson called this the \"vicious circle.\" He then discerned two models of schismogenesis: symmetrical and complementary. Symmetrical relationships are those in which the two parties are equals, competitors, such as in sports. Complementary relationships feature an unequal balance, such as dominance-submission (parent-child), or exhibitionism-spectatorship (performer-audience). Bateson's experiences with the Iatmul led him to publish a book in 1936 titled \"Naven: A Survey of the Problems suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe drawn from Three Points of View\" (Cambridge University Press). The book proved to be a watershed in anthropology and modern social science.\n\nUntil Bateson published \"Naven,\" most anthropologists assumed a realist approach to studying culture, in which one simply described social reality. Bateson's book argued that this approach was naive, since an anthropologist's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data. To think otherwise, stated Bateson, was to be guilty of what Alfred North Whitehead called the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness.\" There was no singular or self-evident way to understand the Iatmul naven rite. Instead, Bateson analysed the rite from three unique points of view: sociological, ethological, and eidological. The book, then, was not a presentation of anthropological analysis but an epistemological account that explored the nature of anthropological analysis itself.\n\nThe sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration. In the 1930s, most anthropologists understood marriage rules to regularly ensure that social groups renewed their alliances. But Iatmul, argued Bateson, had contradictory marriage rules. Marriage, in other words, could not guarantee that a marriage between two clans would at some definite point in the future recur. Instead, Bateson continued, the naven rite filled this function by regularly ensuring exchanges of food, valuables, and sentiment between mothers' brothers and their sisters' children, or between separate lineages. Naven, from this angle, held together the different social groups of each village into a unified whole.\n\nThe ethological point of view interpreted the ritual in terms of the conventional emotions associated with normative male and female behaviour, which Bateson called ethos. In Iatmul culture, observed Bateson, men and women lived different emotional lives. For example, women were rather submissive and took delight in the achievement of others; men fiercely competitive and flamboyant. During the ritual, however, men celebrated the achievement of their nieces and nephews while women were given ritual license to act raucously. In effect, naven allowed men and women to experience momentarily the emotional lives of each other, and thereby to achieve a level of psychological integration.\n\nThe third and final point of view, the eidological, was the least successful. Here Bateson endeavoured to correlate the organisation structure of the naven ceremony with the habitual patterns of Iatmul thought. Much later, Bateson would harness the very same idea to the development of the double-bind theory of schizophrenia.\n\nIn the Epilogue to the book, Bateson was clear: \"The writing of this book has been an experiment, or rather a series of experiments, in methods of thinking about anthropological material.\" That is to say, his overall point was not to describe Iatmul culture of the naven ceremony but to explore how different modes of analysis, using different premises and analytic frameworks, could lead to different explanations of the same sociocultural phenomenon. Not only did Bateson's approach re-shape fundamentally the anthropological approach to culture, but the naven rite itself has remained a locus classicus in the discipline. In fact, the meaning of the ritual continues to inspire anthropological analysis.\n\nBateson next travelled to Bali with his new wife Margaret Mead. They studied the people of the Balinese village Bajoeng Gede. Here, Lipset states, \"in the short history of ethnographic fieldwork, film was used both on a large scale and as the primary research tool.\" Indeed, Bateson took 25,000 photographs of their Balinese subjects.\n\nBateson discovered that the people of Bajoeng Gede raised their children very unlike children raised in Western societies. Instead of attention being paid to a child who was displaying a climax of emotion (love or anger), Balinese mothers would ignore them. Bateson notes, \"The child responds to [a mother's] advances with either affection or temper, but the response falls into a vacuum. In Western cultures, such sequences lead to small climaxes of love or anger, but not so in Bali. At the moment when a child throws its arms around the mother's neck or bursts into tears, the mother's attention wanders\". This model of stimulation and refusal was also seen in other areas of the culture. Bateson later described the style of Balinese relations as stasis instead of schismogenesis. Their interactions were \"muted\" and did not follow the schismogenetic process because they did not often escalate competition, dominance, or submission.\n\nAfter Bali, Bateson and Mead returned to the Sepik River in 1938, and settled into the village of Tambunum, where Bateson spent three days in the 1920s. They aimed to replicate the Balinese project on the relationship between childraising and temperament, and between conventions of the body – such as pose, grimace, holding infants, facial expressions, etc. – reflected wider cultural themes and values. Bateson snapped some 10,000 black and white photographs, and Mead typed thousands of pages of fieldnotes. But Bateson and Mead never published anything substantial from this research.\n\nIn 1956 in Palo Alto, Bateson and his colleagues Donald Jackson, Jay Haley, and John Weakland articulated a related theory of schizophrenia as stemming from double bind situations. The double bind refers to a communication paradox described first in families with a schizophrenic member. The first place where double binds were described (though not named as such) was according to Bateson, in Samuel Butler's \"The Way of All Flesh\" (a semi-autobiographical novel about Victorian hypocrisy and cover-up).\n\nFull double bind requires several conditions to be met:\n\n\nThe strange behaviour and speech of schizophrenics was explained by Bateson et al. as an expression of this paradoxical situation, and were seen in fact as an adaptive response, which should be valued as a cathartic and transformative experience.\n\nThe double bind was originally presented (probably mainly under the influence of Bateson's psychiatric co-workers) as an explanation of part of the etiology of schizophrenia. Currently, it is considered to be more important as an example of Bateson's approach to the complexities of communication which is what he understood it to be.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster's dictionary the term somatic is basically defined as the body or body cells of change distinguished from germplasm or psyche/mind. Bateson writes about how the actual physical changes in the body occur within evolutionary processes. He describes this through the introduction of the concept of \"economics of flexibility\". In his conclusion he makes seven statements or theoretical positions which may be supported by his ideology.\n\nThe first is the idea that although environmental stresses have theoretically been believed to guide or dictate the changes in the soma (physical body), the introduction of new stresses do not automatically result in the physical changes necessary for survival as suggested by original evolutionary theory. In fact the introduction of these stresses can greatly weaken the organism. An example that he gives is the sheltering of a sick person from the weather or the fact that someone who works in an office would have a hard time working as a rock climber and vice versa. The second position states that though \"the economics of flexibility has a logical structure-each successive demand upon flexibility fractioning the set of available possibilities\". This means that theoretically speaking each demand or variable creates a new set of possibilities. Bateson's third conclusion is \"that the genotypic change commonly makes demand upon the adjustive ability of the soma\". This, he states, is the commonly held belief among biologists although there is no evidence to support the claim. Added demands are made on the soma by sequential genotypic modifications is the fourth position. Through this he suggests the following three expectations:\n\n\nThe fifth theoretical position which Bateson believes is supported by his data is that characteristics within an organism that have been modified due to environmental stresses may coincide with genetically determined attributes. His sixth position is that it takes less economic flexibility to create somatic change than it does to cause a genotypic modification. The seventh and final theory he believes to be supported is the idea that in rare occasions there will be populations whose changes will not be in accordance with the thesis presented within this paper. According to Bateson, none of these positions (at the time) could be tested but he called for the creation of a test which could possibly prove or disprove the theoretical positions suggested within.\n\nIn his book \"Steps to an Ecology of Mind\", Bateson applied cybernetics to the field of ecological anthropology and the concept of homeostasis. He saw the world as a series of systems containing those of individuals, societies and ecosystems. Within each system is found competition and dependency. Each of these systems has adaptive changes which depend upon feedback loops to control balance by changing multiple variables. Bateson believed that these self-correcting systems were conservative by controlling exponential slippage. He saw the natural ecological system as innately good as long as it was allowed to maintain homeostasis and that the key unit of survival in evolution was an organism and its environment.\n\nBateson also viewed that all three systems of the individual, society and ecosystem were all together a part of one supreme cybernetic system that controls everything instead of just interacting systems. This supreme cybernetic system is beyond the self of the individual and could be equated to what many people refer to as God, though Bateson referred to it as Mind. While Mind is a cybernetic system, it can only be distinguished as a whole and not parts. Bateson felt Mind was immanent in the messages and pathways of the supreme cybernetic system. He saw the root of system collapses as a result of Occidental or Western epistemology. According to Bateson, consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individual, society and ecology and the mismatch between the systems due to improper understanding will result in the degradation of the entire supreme cybernetic system or Mind. Bateson thought that consciousness as developed through Occidental epistemology was at direct odds with Mind.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is scientific hubris. Bateson argues that Occidental epistemology perpetuates a system of understanding which is purpose or means-to-an-end driven. Purpose controls attention and narrows perception, thus limiting what comes into consciousness and therefore limiting the amount of wisdom that can be generated from the perception. Additionally Occidental epistemology propagates the false notion that man exists outside Mind and this leads man to believe in what Bateson calls the philosophy of control based upon false knowledge.\n\nBateson presents Occidental epistemology as a method of thinking that leads to a mindset in which man exerts an autocratic rule over all cybernetic systems. In exerting his autocratic rule man changes the environment to suit him and in doing so he unbalances the natural cybernetic system of controlled competition and mutual dependency. The purpose-driven accumulation of knowledge ignores the supreme cybernetic system and leads to the eventual breakdown of the entire system. Bateson claims that man will never be able to control the whole system because it does not operate in a linear fashion and if man creates his own rules for the system, he opens himself up to becoming a slave to the self-made system due to the non-linear nature of cybernetics. Lastly, man's technological prowess combined with his scientific hubris gives him the potential to irrevocably damage and destroy the supreme cybernetic system, instead of just disrupting the system temporally until the system can self-correct.\n\nBateson argues for a position of humility and acceptance of the natural cybernetic system instead of scientific arrogance as a solution. He believes that humility can come about by abandoning the view of operating through consciousness alone. Consciousness is only one way in which to obtain knowledge and without complete knowledge of the entire cybernetic system disaster is inevitable. The limited conscious must be combined with the unconscious in complete synthesis. Only when thought and emotion are combined in whole is man able to obtain complete knowledge. He believed that religion and art are some of the few areas in which a man is acting as a whole individual in complete consciousness. By acting with this greater wisdom of the supreme cybernetic system as a whole man can change his relationship to Mind from one of schism, in which he is endlessly tied up in constant competition, to one of complementarity. Bateson argues for a culture that promotes the most general wisdom and is able to flexibly change within the supreme cybernetic system.\n\n\nHis daughter Mary Catherine Bateson published a joint biography of her parents (Bateson and Margaret Mead) in 1984. Bateson's legacy was reintroduced to new audiences by his daughter the filmmaker Nora Bateson, with the release of \"An Ecology of Mind\", a documentary that premiered at the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film was selected as the audience favourite with the \"Morton Marcus Documentary Feature Award\" at the 2011 Santa Cruz Film Festival, and honoured with the 2011 \"John Culkin Award for Outstanding Praxis in the Field of Media Ecology\" by the Media Ecology Association. The Bateson Idea Group (BIG) initiated a web presence in October 2010. The group collaborated with the American Society for Cybernetics for a joint meeting in July 2012 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in California.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Documents that appeared similar were said to “collate”. The collator resulted in rapid advances in the study of literary works.\n\nInvented by Charlton Hinman in the late 1940s, the device used lights and mirrors to superimpose images of the two documents so that differences in text alignment or wording stood out. This resulted in huge improvements in speed and efficiency compared to the traditional cross-referencing of texts by eye.\n\nThe idea built on earlier work such as Carl Pulfrich's blink comparator used to help identify the former planet Pluto, and Hinman's work analysing aerial photographs during World War II.\n\nHinman used his device to compare the many slightly different impressions of the First Folio of William Shakespeare's works. The printing and bookbinding processes used in the time of Shakespeare often resulted in variations in the pages bound into the final books, and the collator enabled Hinman to describe the exact order in which the Folios had been composited and printed. He used the collator to compare 55 different copies of the First Folio held by the Folger Shakespeare Library, and subsequently wrote about his findings in \"Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare\" in 1963.\n\nIn the wake of Hinman's success, the device was purchased by a number of universities, libraries and other institutions (allegedly including the CIA). As more compact types of collator were developed in the 1960s, the last Hinman was built in 1978. In his 2002 survey of mechanical collators, Steven Escar Smith estimates from scattered records that as many as 59 Hinman Collators were produced, 41 of these surviving at the time of his survey's publication. \n\nThe device was developed further by Randall McLeod.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1308594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1308594", "title": "Kashmir Shaivism", "text": "Kashmir Shaivism\n\nKashmir Shaivism is a group of nondualist Tantric Shaiva exegetical traditions from Kashmir that originated after 850 CE. The term Trika was used by Abhinavagupta to represent the entire Kashmir Shaivism or to designate the Pratyabhijna system and this was actually pan-Indian, also flourishing in Oḍiśā and Mahārāṣṭra.\n\nThe \"Tantrāloka\", \"Mālinīślokavārttika\", and \"Tantrasāra\" of the Kashmirian Abhinavagupta (975–1025 CE) are formally an exegesis on the \"Mālinīvijayottara Tantra\", although they also drew heavily on the Kali-based Krama subcategory of the Kulamārga.\n\nKashmir Shaivism claimed to supersede Shaiva Siddhanta, a dualistic tradition which scholars consider normative tantric Shaivism. The Shaiva Siddhanta goal of becoming an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace) was replaced by recognizing oneself as Shiva who, in Kashmir Shaivism's monism, is the entirety of the universe.\n\nDating from around 850-900 CE, the \"Shiva Sutras\" and \"Spandakārikā\" were the first attempt from the Śākta Śaiva domain to present a non-dualistic metaphysics and gnostic soteriology in opposition to the dualistic exegesis of the Shaiva Siddhanta. The \"Shiva Sutras\" appeared to Vasugupta in a dream, according to tradition. The \"Spandakārikā\" was either composed by Vasugupta or his student Bhatta Kallata.\n\nSomananda, the first theologian of monistic Shaivism, was the teacher of Utpaladeva, who was the grand-teacher of Abhinavagupta, who in turn was the teacher of Ksemaraja.\n\nThe \"Tantrāloka\", \"Mālinīślokavārttika\", and \"Tantrasāra\" of the Kashmirian Abhinavagupta (975–1025 CE) are formally an exegesis on the \"Mālinīvijayottara Tantra\", although they also drew heavily on the Kali-based Krama tradition of the Kulamārga.\n\nJayaratha (1150-1200 CE) wrote a commentary on the \"Tantrāloka\".\n\nWhile there may have been yogis and practitioners quietly following the teachings, there were no major writers or publications after perhaps the 14th century. In the 20th century Swami Lakshman Joo, himself a Kashmiri Brahmin, helped revive both the scholarly and yogic streams of Kashmir Shaivism. His contribution is enormous. He inspired a generation of scholars who made Kashmir Shaivism a legitimate field of inquiry within the academy.\n\nAcharya Rameshwar Jha, a disciple of Swami Lakshman Joo, is often credited with firmly establishing the roots of Kashmir Shaivism in the learned community of Varanasi. Rameshwar Jha with his extraordinary creativity, innate familiarity with the ancient texts and personal experiences was able to provide easy access to abstruse concepts of non dualistic Kashmir Shaivism to the layman and scholars alike. His original writings of Sanskrit verses have been compiled and published as books \"Purnta Pratyabhijna\" and \"Samit Swatantram\".\n\nNor should the contribution of Swami Muktananda be overlooked. While himself not belonging to the direct lineage of Kashmir Shaivism, Muktananda felt a great affinity for the teachings which were validated by his own direct experience. He encouraged and endorsed Motilal Banarsidass to publish Jaideva Singh's translations of Shiva Sutras, Pratyabhijnahrdayam, Spanda Karikas and Vijnana Bhairava. He also introduced Kashmir Shaivism to a wide audience of western meditators through his writings and lectures on the subject.\n\nThe \"Vijnana Bhairava Tantra\", a chapter from the \"Rudrayamala Tantra\", was introduced to the West by Paul Reps, a student of Lakshman Joo. Reps brought the text to wider attention by including an English translation in his popular book \"Zen Flesh, Zen Bones\". Cast as a discourse between the god Shiva and his consort Devi or Shakti, it briefly presents 112 meditation methods or centering techniques (\"dharana\"s).\n\nTo attain \"moksha\", \"sādhana\" or spiritual practice is necessary. Kashmir Shaivism describes four methods (\"upāya\"-s):\n\nWhile most other paths observe offering incense and external objects to the deity, this path takes on to offering breaths. The individual controls his heart and pulse by reducing it significantly. The final stage is renouncing consumption of food and water. As a result, he/she connects the state of the supreme in the form of Shiva which results in purification of the body and generation of ojas.\n\nAlthough domesticated into a householder tradition, Kashmir Shaivism recommended a \"secret\" performance of Kaula practices in keeping with its heritage. This was to be done in seclusion from public eyes, therefore allowing one to maintain the appearance of a typical householder.\n\nTantric scholar-practitioner Christopher Wallis outlines the philosophical view of non-dual Shaiva Tantra thus:\n\nAll that exists, throughout all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects within the field of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, is the result of the natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.\n\nThe nondual or monistic philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism is called Pratyabhijna. Ksemaraja, the student of Abhinavagupta, extended this philosophy to a broad range of tantric Saiva texts.\n\n\"Aham\" is the concept of supreme reality as heart. It is considered to be a non-dual interior space of Śiva, support for the entire manifestation, supreme mantra and identical to Śakti.\n\nKashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are both non-dual philosophies that give primacy to Universal Consciousness (\"Chit\" or \"Brahman\"). In Kashmir Shaivism, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness, but the phenomenal world (\"Śakti\") is real, existing and having its being in Consciousness (\"Chit\").\n\nAs a monistic tantric system, Trika Shaivism, as it is also known, draws teachings from shrutis, such as the monistic \"Bhairava Tantras\", Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta, and also a unique version of the \"\" which has a commentary by Abhinavagupta, known as the \"Gitartha Samgraha\". Teachings are also drawn from the \"Tantrāloka\" of Abhinavagupta, prominent among a vast body of \"smritis\" employed by Kashmir Shaivism.\n\nIn general, the whole written tradition of Shaivism can be divided in three fundamental parts: \"Āgama Śāstra\", \"Spanda Śāstra\" and \"Pratyabhijñā Śāstra\".\n\n1. \"Āgama Śāstra\" are those writings that are considered as being a direct revelation from Siva. These writings were first communicated orally, from the master to the worthy disciple. They include essential works such as ', ', ', ', ', ', \"\" and others. There are also numerous commentaries to these works, \"\" having most of them.\n\n2. ', the main work of which is ' of Bhatta Kallata, a disciple of Vasugupta, with its many commentaries. Out of them, two are of major importance: ' (this commentary talks only about the first verses of '), and \"\" (which is a commentary of the complete text).\n\n3. \"Pratyabhijñā Śāstra\" are those writings which have mainly a metaphysical content. Due to their extremely high spiritual and intellectual level, this part of the written tradition of Shaivism is the least accessible for the uninitiated. Nevertheless, this corpus of writings refer to the simplest and most direct modality of spiritual realization. \"Pratyabhijñā\" means \"recognition\" and refers to the spontaneous recognition of the divine nature hidden in each human being (atman). The most important works in this category are: ', the fundamental work of Utpaladeva, and ', a commentary to '. ' means in fact the direct recognition of the Lord (\"Īśvara\") as identical to one's Heart. Before \"Utpaladeva\", his master \"Somānanda\" wrote \"\" (\"The Vision of Siva\"), a devotional poem written on multiple levels of meaning.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46287275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46287275", "title": "Knowledge enterprise", "text": "Knowledge enterprise\n\nKnowledge enterprise, also named as knowledge company or knowledge-intensive company, or enterprise. According to D. Jemielniak, origin, and scope of this term is unclear. How this can be understood depends on how much company depends on knowledge, that in such a configuration, should be a critical asset of organization. There is no agreement on how knowledge-intensive (to what extent) companies should be to be named like so. However, there are some hints to distinguish knowledge companies, since in economies, there are two groups of companies, of which one is labor-intensive, and another knowledge intensive.\n\nAccording to Jemielniak, knowledge enterprises have emerged due to changes in the global economy, which throughout decades has been giving greater priorities to services. The emergence of knowledge companies is also called as a symptom of the third industrial revolution where boundaries between owners of production resources, and workers. On the example of IBM it can be seen that such a change have influenced the structure of income of companies. In 1924, IBM’s profits were generated by leasing of manufacturing equipment in 96%, while punched cards were responsible for 4% of the profit. In 1970’s, 80% of profit came from equipment divisions, 15% from software division and 5% from services. In 1990’s services contributed to 30% of IBM’s profits, later in 2007 it was already 45% that the company had earned from rendering services, and 20% from software. This example only reflects the overall change, that is manifested by the reversed proportion between tangible and intangible assets of companies. This evolution has forced a shift in the access to these resources from manual to non-manual (knowledge) workers. Also decision making power is handed in top-down, from owners, and top managers to mid-managers and specialists. These developments accompany the emergence and growing importance of knowledge enterprises.\n\nKnowledge enterprises, according to Lowendahl, can be divided into:\nand example companies are: management consultancy companies.\nIn another approach knowledge companies are divided into professional service companies, and research and development companies.\n\nKnowledge enterprises, due to their high-tech profile, chiefly have to base on IT technologies, including hardware and software to conduct managerial processes, and to organize working environments for all the staff, from executive to top management. This is why software development is crucial for existence and evolution of such companies. Software applications are developed for many areas within such organizations, since without them it is difficult to control, and coordinate work that is dedicated to innovation, and problem solving.\n\nThe main reason of ‘drain brain’ phenomenon and involvement of knowledge companies into it, is a great gap between educational infrastructure in the origin countries that IT professionals can get (but it is not limited to this profession), and low wages that they can be proposed in the origin country. The problem is that educational infrastructure in the transition countries (Central and Eastern Europe) does not actually have to catch-up with the counterparts in knowledge-based economies, like the United States. However salaries of the knowledge workers in both groups of countries differ very much. Knowledge-intensive companies from knowledge-based economies may propose much better incentives to have them move and work for them. This is the reason why human resources from transition countries are drained to those countries, that are characterized by the salary competitive advantage.\n"}

Jacks was an English educator, philosopher, and Unitarian minister who rose to prominence in the period from World War I to World War II.\n\nJacks was born on 9 October 1860 in Nottingham. In 1882, he enrolled in Manchester New College (which then was in London). After graduating with a M.A. in 1886, he spent a year at Harvard University, where he studied with the philosopher Josiah Royce. In 1887, he became assistant minister to Stopford Brooke in his chapel in Bloomsbury, London. He served as assistant minister for a year, and then accepted a position as Unitarian minister for Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel in Liverpool.\n\nIn 1889 Jacks married Olive Brooke, the daughter of Stopford Brooke. They had six children together. During this time, Jacks' circle of associates included George Bernard Shaw, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, and Oscar Wilde. Jacks was appointed minister for the Church of the Messiah, Birmingham in 1894.\n\nJacks served as Principal of Manchester College, which was by then based in Oxford, from 1915 until his retirement in 1931.\n\nJacks served as the editor of the \"Hibbert Journal\" from its founding in 1902 until 1948. Under his editorship the \"Journal\" became one of the leading forums in England for work in philosophy and religion, and introduced the work of Alfred Loisy to British readers. In September 1915, he wrote in support of the war effort, citing the need to defeat German militarism and defend \"the liberties of our race.\" His article, titled \"The Peacefulness of Being at War\" in \"The New Republic\", argued that the war had \"brought to England a peace of mind such as she had not possessed for decades,\" claiming that the sense of common purpose brought on by the war had overcome social fragmentation and improved English life. Jacks was interested in parapsychology and was President for the Society for Psychical Research (1917-1918). \n\nAfter the war, Jacks wrote prolifically and gained popularity as a lecturer in Britain and America. He frequently returned to the theme of militarism and the \"mechanical\" mindset, which he regarded as one of the greatest threats in modern life. In his \"Revolt Against Mechanism\" (1933), he wrote that \"The mechanical mind has a passion for control—of everything except itself. Beyond the control it has won over the forces of nature it would now win control over the forces of society of stating the problem and producing the solution, with social machinery to correspond.\" He proposed liberal education and world vision as a hope for salvation from the mechanistic world, in books such as his \"Education for the Whole Man\" (1931) and his 1938 BBC Radio Lectures. In his article \"A Demilitarized League of Nations\", (\"Hibbert Journal\", August 1936) Jacks argued the League of Nations should completely eschew military force.\n\nAlthough he continued to preach Unitarianism, he became increasingly critical of all forms of institutional religion and denominationalism, and refused to let his name be added to a list of Unitarian ministers published by the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches in 1928. He accepted an invitation to preach in Liverpool Cathedral in 1933; a Convocation of the Church of England rebuked the cathedral for allowing a Unitarian to preach, igniting a controversy in the press.\n\nJacks published prolifically over a period of fifty years, including philosophical and visionary treatises, biographies, articles, and moral parables. He died in Oxford on 17 February 1955, at the age of 94.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Coming to Canada at the age of 19, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force in bomber-reconnaissance operations on the Atlantic Coast from 1942 to 1947, subsequently becoming a Canadian citizen. He then began his studies at the University of Toronto.\n\nHe was a Roman Catholic.\n\nDewart's academic interests were wide-ranging, and evolved considerably over the course of his career. He first graduated with a BA in Honours Psychology in 1951. He then enrolled in the Graduate Department of Philosophy, receiving his MA in 1952 and his PhD quickly thereafter in 1954. He began his teaching career in Philosophy at the University of Detroit in 1954, then returned to Toronto to teach at St. Michael’s College in its then independent Department of Philosophy from 1956 to 1968.\n\nHe was appointed to the Department of Philosophy, School of Graduate Studies in 1961. His interests in theory of knowledge and religion then led him to join the Department of Religious Studies, St. Michael’s College in 1968 to 1975, and he served in the Institute of Christian Thought there from 1969 to 1979, and the Faculty of Theology from 1968 to 1988.\n\nLate in 1969 an investigation by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was convened to examine the theological opinions in Dewart's writings, particularly \"The Future of Belief\". However, no condemnatory action was taken by the authorities.\n\nAmong his other appointments in the field were: Chair of the University of Toronto Combined Departments of Religious Studies (1970 to 1971), Professor in the later University of Toronto Department of Religious Studies (1975 to 1988) and the Graduate Centre for Religious Studies (1976 to 1988 – the year of his retirement). During this time, Professor Dewart strongly argued for the continuation of a place for Theology in these University divisions.\n\nDuring his time in Philosophy and Religious Studies, Dewart served in editorial or advisory capacities for journals such as \"Continuum\", \"Internationale Dialog Zeitschrift\", \"Concurrence\", \"Studies in Religion – Sciences réligieuses\" and \"Journal of Ultimate Reality and Meaning\".\n\nIn the late 1970s Dewart turned his attention to the study of law, receiving the LLB from the Faculty of Law, University of Toronto in 1979, and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1981.\n\nDewart’s obituary [Globe and Mail, 2 Jan., 2010] begins, \"His plan completed.…\" These terse words beg examination of his \"plan\" which he had outlined as an afterword in his last book published posthumously, \"Hume's Challenge and the Renewal of Modern Philosophy.\" In the epilogue (cf. David Hume). \"The Future of Philosophy,\" he judged that his attempts at understanding the failure of modern philosophy may or may not have succeeded. \"It is not out of the question that in the future there should be other attempts, besides mine, to understand the historical causes of the failure of modern philosophy, and to attempt to remedy them. And if such attempts reach the correct conclusions that have escaped me, they should yield more adequate proposals than mine.\" In its intent, Dewart's purpose was not unlike like that of Edmund Husserl. Quentin Lauer notes that Husserl, \"conceived it as his task to establish the method whereby phenomenological analyses and essential intuitions would be made possible, thus devoting his whole life to the development of a phenomenological program rather than to the actual carrying out of the phenomenological analyses, which he hoped would be accomplished, generation after generation, by a whole community of scholars devoting itself to the sort of method he tried to perfect during his lifetime.\" Dewart realized that his generation had not seen philosophy overcome the mistakes that brought it down. And returning, in this secular age, to theology or a religious faith to overcome these mistakes was not an option in Dewart’s plan for the future of philosophy. Science’s brief ascendency and profitable contribution to civilized society, which is currently waning, had not taught modern society how to wield power without doing harm to itself and the world. Philosophy needs a sound understanding of human nature to do that. However, his plan for philosophy amounted to minority viewpoint within a minority viewpoint. Regarding this minority community of philosophers, whom he referenced in his books, he wrote: \"I have referred to a few of the few others who are like-minded,\" acknowledging, however, that their reasons for their discontent differed from his. He accepted that his recommendations for future philosophical improvement may ultimately prove useless. But, he acknowledged at the same time that reason may eventually prevail.\n\nAn exercise in \"Dehellenization.\"\n\nWestern philosophy is no longer restricted to the ideas of a classical world, but may be consciously undertaken within the personal world of experience that is beginning to \"dehellenize\" itself. Although written as a text on political philosophy, this philosophical lesson was learned from the Cuban revolutionary experience (cf. his first book). Although not widely recognized at the time, the revolutionary experience was, in fact, a process of \"dehellenization,\" as Dewart understands the process throughout in his writings. Thinkers will conceive of God, in a dehellenized future of thought, as an existential reality, Dewart maintains.\n\nWestern philosophy, \"come of age,\" does not experience the world as hostile, as did the Hellenists, but rather, as stimulating and challenging and Western philosophy must dehellenize its interpretation of experience accordingly. This dehellenization requires the abandonment of scholasticism, with the subsequent development of a conscious re-conceptualization of experience. Dewart identifies the development of human conscious re-conceptualization as dehellenization, which is a positive term. It is not \"un-hellenization,\" since dehellenization evolves out of Hellenization. Dehellenization is but the current stage within Western philosophy’s evolution, and it may not be the last.\n\nThe religious perspective motivates Dewart’s thinking, to varying degrees throughout all his works, and it is by his own words that his notion of dehellenization is expressed most succinctly.\n\nDewart on Conscious Communication and Computers\n\nIndeed, some people who have first hand acquaintance with speech are nevertheless so confused about what they do when they speak - and therefore when they think - that they even wonder whether computers do not think.\n\nAn eminent computer scientist once thus proposed - he was serious, and convinced many of his colleagues - that unless one could tell the difference between teleprinter exchanges between oneself and a computer, and like exchanges between oneself and another human being, one should admit that there is no essential difference between the human's and the machine's 'thinking' processes.\nHowever, not a few philosophical arguments to the contrary have been comparably wide of the mark, such as those based on absence of emotion, moral sensibility, and so on, in computers. Strangely, those who raise these objections rarely point out what would be more relevant: that computers are not even alive. Objections based on the supposed differences between what the computer and what human beings can do are beside the point - which is that the computer does not perform at all any of the vital activities that the absent-minded project onto them.\n\nThis shows, however, the same absent-minded muddle that would be revealed by someone who wondered whether telephones did not speak and think (for, tinny voice aside, they are apt to give very thoughtful replies), or who reasoned that books think (since they contain and communicate thoughts). The user is not in communication with the computer, any more than the reader communicates with the book or the caller with the telephone - even when he is greeted by an answering machine. Quite as the reader. of the book communicates with the author and with himself, the user of a computer is in communication, first, with himself, using the machine to think more efficiently than otherwise, and, second, with the programmer who wrote the application, whose thinking is embodied in the program. A user may well be unable to determine whether he is in communication with other human beings through a computer or else directly. But this should be no more astonishing than the inability to determine, in like circumstances, whether one is receiving a telephone message viva voce or only a prerecorded one. Even with unlimited exchanges, the mediation of a computer could be detected only by a user who was more skilled at detecting the programmed nature of the responses than the programmer - not the computer - was at hiding it. As an abacus and a slide rule are tools wherewith the user can perform complex mathematical operations more efficiently than without, though the instruments themselves cannot so much as add one plus one, a computer is a machine for thinking, not a machine that thinks.\n\nEvidently, those who fail to perceive the difference disregard the distinction between the activity of thinking and the contents of thought. The latter can be objectified and embodied by the thinker - through his manipulation of, say, ink and paper, sliding beads, or electric currents and magnetic fields - in visual or other signs that he (and other human beings) can understand. Only such disregard would permit their ignoring the fact that being alive and being capable of experiencing are among the indispensable prerequisites of thinking. Nor do they seem to realize that even true communication with another would not be, of itself, proof that the communicator thinks; the latter would require evidence that the communicator communicates to himself what he also communicates to his communicand.\n\n[In the short run the invention of the computer, and in particular of computers having what is misleadingly called ‘artificial intelligence,’ can be an asset.] This may be deemed a close parallel of the invention of phonetic writing not least of all because it may prove to be the cause of cultural changes comparable in magnitude only to the Sumerian innovation. It is already possible - though with limitations that are certain to be overcome before long - to build computers that (to put it loosely) understand spoken instructions and reply in kind, that can translate from one human language to another, that exercise judgment 'on the basis of previous experience (for instance, they offer medical diagnoses and prescribe medical procedures), and that seem to think and reason in ways that are distinguishable from the human processes only in being more reliable and exceedingly faster. Of course, a computer that takes verbal instructions and responds with intelligible vocal sounds - either in the same or in another language - discoursing on, say, medical subjects, no more understands speech or medicine than a typewriter thil1ks and then communicates its medical wisdom by typing out a medical textbook. It is the human beings who use it, and who interact by means of it, that alone perform these activities; the computer could be attributed 'artificial intelligence' only in the same metaphorical sense in which levers might be ascribed 'artificial muscle power.' Thus, using a computer that has been appropriately programmed to lend him tile skills of human medical experts, a person can produce results that surpass what he could do on his own - the very thing that a medical textbook can help him do, though on a much smaller scale.\n\nBut many people are unclear about the difference between the activity and the contents of thought; they therefore assume that 'artificial intelligence' is possible, and are inspired to create it. My point is that their not knowing better facilitates their success. For instance, they analyse human speech and thought in order to recreate these processes electronically in computers. Now, if they took into account the assertiveness of speech and thought, they would realize that the threshold requirement for producing these is some sort of self-oriented causal process - in other words, the purposiveness that is found only in living entities - and would therefore deem impossible the creation of a machine with artificial intelligence. Their unawareness of this impossibility, however, holds a paradoxical advantage: speech and thought as they mistakenly conceive them are the kind that can be electronically reproduced. In the end they do not, to be sure, create a true counterpart of the human processes; but what they actually achieve is a marvel none the less, and multiplies immeasurably the power of human beings to bring about change. Now, why should 'artificial intelligence' be created? And for what ends should it be used once it is created? These questions are not likely to be adequately answered either by scientists who are so confused about themselves that they conceive the idea of creating it, nor by the equally perplexed, eager consumers of scientific technology who defer to them.\n\nDewart published five books during his career:\n\n\n\n"}

It tells the story of Apollonius of Tyana (c. 15 – c. 100 AD), a Pythagorean philosopher and teacher.\n\nThe book extensively describes the alleged travels of Apollonius to Italy, Hispania, Nubia, Mesopotamia and India. Some scholars view it as fiction, and contend that Apollonius probably never reached any of these countries, but spent his entire life in the East of the Roman Empire.\n\nAccording to Philostratus, his book relies on a multiplicity of sources:\n\nThe eastward travel of Apollonius is described in Book I. Apollonius receives from the Parthian king Vardanes (40–47) a safe-conduct to the Parthian ruler Phraotes in India:\nAnd with that, he showed them a letter, written to that effect, and this gave them occasion to marvel afresh at the humanity and foresight of Vardanes. For he had addressed the letter in question to the satrap of the Indus, although he was not subject to his dominion; and in it he reminded him of the good service he had done him, but declared that he would not ask any recompense for the same, \"for\", he said, \"it is not my habit to ask for a return of favors.\" But he said he would be very grateful, if he could give a welcome to Apollonius and send him on wherever he wished to go. And he had given gold to the guide, so that in case he found Apollonius in want thereof, he might give it him and save him from looking to the generosity of anyone else. – Book II:17 \n\nThe description of Apollonius's visit to India is made in Book II, and particularly the visit to the city of Taxila, described in chapters 20 to 24. He describes constructions of the Greek type in Taxila, probably referring to Sirkap:\nTaxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities\nI have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above. – Book II:23\n\nHe also explains that the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, named Phraotes, speaks Greek fluently, a language in which he had been educated while in exile to the east, beyond the river Hyphasis:\nTell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, and whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place? – Book II:29 \nMy father, after a Greek education, brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves. – Book II:31 \n\n\n\n"}

From 2004 to 2009, she served as a residentiary canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. During that time, she was elected as an university representative to the General Synod of the Church of England.\n\nAdams' work in philosophy focused on the philosophy of religion, especially the problem of evil, philosophical theology, metaphysics and medieval philosophy. Her work on the problem of evil largely focused on what she calls \"horrendous evils\". She was an avowed Christian universalist, believing that ultimately all will receive salvation and restoration in Christ:Traditional doctrines of hell err again by supposing either that God does not get what God wants with every human being (\"God wills all humans to be saved\" by God's antecedent will) or that God deliberately creates some for ruin. To be sure, many human beings have conducted their ante-mortem lives in such a way as to become anti-social persons. Almost none of us dies with all the virtues needed to be fit for heaven. Traditional doctrines of hell suppose that God lacks the will or the patience or the resourcefulness to civilize each and all of us, to rear each and all of us up into the household of God. They conclude that God is left with the option of merely human penal systems – viz., liquidation or quarantine!\n\nIn 1966, Marilyn McCord married Robert Merrihew Adams.\n\nAdams died on March 22, 2017, in Princeton, New Jersey, aged 73; she had had cancer.\n\n\n\n"}

This concept has been useful to anthropologists in refining the definition of culture. For instance, Edward Tylor, the first academic anthropologist, included both artifacts and such abstract concepts as kinship systems as elements of culture. Anthropologist Robert Aunger explains that such an inclusive definition ends up encouraging poor anthropological practice because \"it becomes difficult to distinguish what exactly is \"not\" part of culture\". Aunger goes on to explain that after the cognitive revolution in the social sciences in the 1960s, there is \"considerable agreement\" among anthropologists that a mentifactual analysis, one that assumes that culture consists of \"things in the head\" (i.e. mentifacts) is the most appropriate way to define the concept of culture.\n"}

He writes, “Nothingness is not nothing [\"rien\"]...There is no ontology without the dialectic or the paradox of a meontology...Nothing is the thing tending toward its pure and simple being of a thing.” Nothing is “the vanishing, momentary quality of the smallest amount of beingness (\"étantité\").” \n\nFor Emmanuel Levinas, what was meontological was what had meaning beyond being, beyond ontology; for him this was the ethical, the primary demand of the other in the face-to-face encounter. In this sense he sought to clarify or take further some of the issues raised by Heidegger and explicitly give ontology a secondary role to ethics rather than continue to parallel them in saying that the Being means care (German: \"Sorge\").\n\n"}

It is equally a philosophical system, a medicine, and a form of yoga. The system's theoretical and practical aspects are based on the premise that the entire cosmos and all that exists in the cosmos, including human beings, consists of sound vibrations, called nāda. This concept holds that it is the sound energy in motion rather than of matter and particles which form the building blocks of the cosmos.\n\nNada\n\nNāda yoga is also a reverential way to approach and respond to sound. In this context, sound [and] music carry a spiritual weight more meaningful, respectively, than what sensory properties normally provide. Sound and music are considered to play a potential medium/intermediary role to achieve a deeper unity with both the outer and inner cosmos.\nNāda yoga's use of sound vibrations and resonances are also used to pursue palliative effects on various problematic psychological and spiritual conditions. It is also employed to raise the level of awareness of the postulated energy centers called chakra. \n\nMusic has been used by most Indian saints as an important and powerful tool in the quest for the achievement of nirvana; notable names to be mentioned here include Kanakadasa, Thyagaraja, Kabir, Meerabai, Namdeo, Purandaradasa and Tukaram... Nada\n\nThe Nāda yoga system divides music into two categories: internal music, \"anahata\", and external music, \"ahata\". While the external music is conveyed to consciousness via sensory organs in the form of the ears, in which mechanical energy is converted to electrochemical energy and then transformed in the brain to sensations of sound, it is the anahata chakra, which is considered responsible for the reception of the internal music, but not in the way of a normal sensory organ. \n\nThe anahata concept refers to one's own personal sound vibrations, which are thought to be so closely associated with one's self and the Self that a person can not share their anahata with another human being. In other words, this inner sound is sacred and once reached will open the practitioner's chakras, which ultimately will unite the body to the divine/cosmos.\n\nWith continued sounds, a focused mind and controlled breath, the individual can, according to Nāda yoga, \"listen in on\" their own anahata, their own \"inner sound\", which can take up to nine different forms. Such a process of inner awareness and sensitivity leads to increased self-recollectedness and finally to awakening.\n\nTo concentrate on this inner sound as a support for meditation is very helpful to tame the mind, and when it has been clearly recognized, used for self-recollectedness in outer life as well. Eventually, it can be experienced as penetrating all matter and indeed vibrates eternally throughout the Creation.\n\nIn Nāda yoga, one of the main breathing sounds is ahaṃ, where each part of the word (a ha ṃ) is focused on and spoken individually. The echoes produced by each of these spoken letters is a time where the yogi should immerse herself and rest. Now, because of imbalances within the human body, Nāda yoga begins by removing the ailments and impurities by \"awakening the fire in the body (jāṭhara)\" (Timalsina 212) with the use of a sound resembling that of a bee. It is important to note that when the yogi/yogini is forming sounds, their mind should not wander off to other entities. \n\nOne group to incorporate yoga, Nāda yoga specifically, and the practice of sound into the spiritual transformation is the Josmanĩ. The Josmanĩ are identified as a Sant tradition, and they are a blend of Śrī Vaiṣṇava Bhakti tradition with the Nāth Yoga tradition. Yoga is used in \"personal and social transformation\" (Timalsina 202). The Josmani's spiritual quest interlinks the practice of Kuṇḍali and Nāda Yoga.\n\nIn the West, detailed indications and advice have been given by Edward Salim Michael in his book : the Law of attention, Nada Yoga and the way of inner vigilance. Ajahn Sumedho, from the Thai Forest Tradition also teaches the practice of this inner sound.\n\nThe condition known in western medicine as tinnitus is considered in Ayurvedic medicine to possibly be caused by spiritual awakening to the \"anahata.\" \n\n\"Nada Bindu Upanishad\"\n\n\"Shurangama Sutra\"\n\nThe Śūraṅgama Sūtra, often spelled Shurangama Sutra or Surangama Sutra in English, is a Mahayana sutra and one of the main texts used in the Chán school in Chinese Buddhism. In the Surangama Sutra, Avalokitesvara says that he attained enlightenment through concentration on the subtle inner sound. The Buddha then praises Avalokitesvara and says that this is the supreme way to go.\n\n\"How sweetly mysterious is the Transcendental Sound of Avalokiteshvara! It is the pure Brahman Sound.

Jamgon Kongtrul (1813–1899) provides an important paradigm of salience for the esoteric Dzogchen doctrine of \"sound, light and rays\" (Wylie: sgra 'od zer gsum) and the 'mantra' of the Mantrayana tradition in particular, Kongtrul, \"et al.\" (2005: p. 431) identifies the “primordial sound” (\"nāda\") and its semantic field:\n\nThe primordial indestructible great vital essence (\"gdod ma'i mi shigs pa'i thig le chen po\"), which is the root or ground of all of cyclic life [samsara] and perfect peace [nirvana], is known as primordial (\"gdod ma\") because it has no beginning or end; as indestructible (\"mi shigs pa\") because it is indivisible; as vital essence (\"thig le\") because it pervades the various appearances; and as great (\"chen po\") because there is nothing that it does not encompass.\nThere are countless synonyms for the primordial indestructible great vital essence, such as \"great seal\" (\"phyag rgya chen po, mahāmudrā\"), \"great bliss\" (\"bde ba chen po, mahāsukha\"), \"primordial sound\" (\"nāda\"), \"all-pervading vajra of space\" (\"mkha' khyab nam mkha'i rdo rje\"), \"ordinary awareness\" (\"tha mal shes pa\"), \"pristine awareness channel\" (\"ye shes kyi rtsa\"), \"pristine awareness wind\" (\"ye she kyi rlung\"), \"invincible \"ham\"\" (\"gzhom med kyi ham\"), \"invincible vital essence\" (\"gzhom med kyi thig le\"), \"essence of enlightenment\" (\"sugatagarbha\"), and \"transcendent wisdom\" (\"she rab phar phyin, prajnā-pāramitā\") (CPR, f. 29a3-b2).\nThis quotation comes from the famed \"Sheja Dzö\" or 'The Treasury of Knowledge' () a voluminous work, encyclopedic in breadth, by Jamgon Kongtrul.\n\n2. The Mahasiddha Vinapa (The Musician) achieved mahamudra through contemplation of the unborn, unstruck sound:\n\nWith perseverance and devotion\nI mastered the vina's errant chords;\nbut then practicing the unborn, unstruck sound\nI, Vinapa, lost my self.\n...his mastery of the \"unborn, unstruck sound\" made audible by eradication of concepts, judgements, comparisons and criticism that obscure cognition of the pure sound of the instrument, is accomplishment of the fulfilment process. The unstruck sound is the sound of silence and is the auditory equivalent of phenomenal emptiness. It is absolute sound; it is the potential sound of everything composed and waiting to be composed. Lost in this non-sound, the sense of self becomes infinitely diffused in emptiness.\nThese quotes are from p. 91 and p. 93 respectively of \"Masters of Mahamudra: Songs and Histories of the Eighty-four Buddhist Siddhas\" by Keith Dowman, Publisher: State University of New York Press ()\n\n\n"}

This concept comprises experiences of ownership, of first person perspective, and of a long-term unity of beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the prefrontal cortex. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of consciousness and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR). Thomas Metzinger advanced the theory in his 1993 book \"Subjekt und Selbstmodell\" (Subject and self-model).\n\nThe PSM is an entity that “actually exists, not only as a distinct theoretical entity but something that will be empirically discovered in the future- for instance, as a specific stage of the global neural dynamics in the human brain”. Involved in the PSM are three phenomenal properties that must occur in order to explain the concept of the self. The first is mineness, “a higher order property of particular forms of phenomenal content,” or the idea of ownership. The second is perspectivalness, which is “a global, structural property of phenomenal space as a whole”. More simply, it is what is commonly referred to as the ecological self, the immovable center of perception. The third phenomenal property is selfhood, which is “the phenomenal target property” or the idea of the self over time. It is the property of phenomenal selfhood that plays the most important role in creating the fictional self and the first person perspective. Metzinger defines the first person perspective as the “existence of single coherent and temporally stable model of reality which is representationally centered around or on a single coherent and temporally stable phenomenal subject”. The first-person perspective can be non-conceptual and is autonomously active due to the constant reception of perceptual information by the brain. The brain, specifically the brainstem and hypothalamus, processes this information into representational content, namely linguistic reflections. The PSM then uses this representational content to attribute phenomenal states to our perceived objects and ourselves. We are thus what Metzinger calls naïve realists, who believe we are perceiving reality directly when in actuality we are only perceiving representations of reality. The data structures and transport mechanisms of the data are “transparent” so that we can introspect on our representations of perceptions, but cannot introspect on the data or mechanisms themselves. These systemic representational experiences are then connected by subjective experience to generate the phenomenal property of selfhood. Subjective experience is the result of the Phenomenal Model of Intentionality Relationship (PMIR). The PMIR is a “conscious mental model, and its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation”. The model is a result of the combination of our unique set of sensory receptors that acquire input, our unique set of experiences that shape connections within the brain, and our unique positions in space that give our perception perspectivalness.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is implicated in all the functions of the human self model. The following functions all require communication with the prefrontal cortex; agency and association areas of the cortex; spatial perspectivity and the parietal lobes, unity and the temporal lobes.\n\nDisorders of the self model are implicated in several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and depersonalization. According to this theory, long-term unity is impaired in autism, similar to theory of mind deficits and weak central coherence theory. Individuals with autism are thought to be impaired in assigning mental states to other people, an ability that probably codevelops with long-term unity of self. Weak central coherence, that is, the inability to assemble information into a cohesive whole, reflects the same problems with creating a unified sense of self and benific sense extreme in narcissism.\n\n"}

It focuses on the teachings of the Buddha as presented in the vipassana, or Insight Meditation, tradition. It was founded in 1987 as Insight Meditation West, and is visited by an estimated 40,000 people a year. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" has called it one of \"the Bay Area's best-known centers for Buddhist meditation.\"\n\nIn 1975 the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) was founded in Barre, MA by a group of Western meditation teachers trained in Asia, including Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzberg. In 1986, after ten years at IMS, Kornfield moved to Northern California with his family and began hosting a Monday night meditation class in a private home in San Anselmo. Eventually the class expanded to a clinic and then to a local church. In 1987 a group of meditation teachers in the San Francisco Bay Area incorporated as Insight Meditation West, for the purpose of acquiring land and establishing a west coast Insight Meditation center. The group included Kornfield, James Baraz, Sylvia Boorstein, Anna Douglas and Howard Cohn.\n\nIn 1988, with funds from an anonymous donation, 412 acres of undeveloped land in the San Geronimo Valley, an hour north of San Francisco, was purchased from The Nature Conservancy in order to start a permanent meditation center, and the name Spirit Rock Meditation Center was formally adopted. In 1990 temporary construction trailers were erected to house the community meditation hall, administrative offices and caretaker residences. Construction for permanent replacement facilities began in 2014. and in 2016, a new Community Meditation Center, staff village and administrative buildings were completed.\n\nThe residential retreat center opened in July 1998. The majority of the center’s land is protected by an open space easement and kept in conservation.\n\nThe teachings at Spirit Rock focus on the practice of vipassanā as taught in the Theravada tradition. Teachings focus on training and quieting the mind, on the teachings of Gautama Buddha as found in Buddhist texts, and on incorporating the Dharma into daily life. Retreats are modeled on those held for lay people in the Thai Forest Tradition, including sitting and walking meditation, meetings with the teachers and the observation of silence by practitioners.\n\nIn addition to vipassana teachings, Spirit Rock hosts teachers from Zen, Tibetan and nondual traditions as guest teachers throughout the year. Visiting teachers have included the 14th Dalai Lama, Thích Nhất Hạnh, Ba Khin, Preah Maha Ghosananda, Anagarika Munindra, Kalu Rinpoche, Ram Dass, Pema Chödrön, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Huston Smith, Adyashanti, Tara Brach, Alice Walker, Zoketsu Norman Fischer and others.\n\nA portion of the classes, daylongs and retreats at Spirit Rock are organized as community-specific programs to promote diversity. These programs are referred to as Kindred Sangha and include self-identified people of color, women, LGBT-IQ community, families, young adults, and elders. Class offerings also address the application of Buddhist teachings to modern issues such as addiction and trauma. Spirit Rock offers scholarships to make classes and retreats available to those who cannot otherwise afford them.\n\nThe center is supported by fees charged for classes and retreats, and by donations. The paid staff runs the day-to-day operations of Spirit Rock Meditation Center with support from volunteers. Residential retreat managers are volunteers who rely on voluntary dāna (donations) from participants to support their work. Teachers on residential retreats are supported by donations from the students, as is the practice in the Buddhist tradition. but on non-residential retreats, daylong retreats, events and classes teachers are supported by fees paid by attendees to Spirit Rock.\n\nSpirit Rock’s teaching programs are developed by the Teachers Council, a collective of teachers. A volunteer Board of Directors, composed of teachers and community members, is the central decision-making body for Spirit Rock. The work of the Board is supported by a number of committees.\n\nCurrent Spirit Rock teachers (as of 2017) include Ajahn Amaro, Ayya Anandabodhi; Sally Armstrong; Guy Armstrong; James Baraz; Sylvia Boorstein; Eugene Cash; Debra Chamberlin-Taylor; Howard Cohn; Mark Coleman; Dana DePalma; Anna Douglas; Andrea Fella; Anushka Fernandopulle; Gil Fronsdal; Robert Hall; Will Kabat-Zinn; Jack Kornfield; Phillip Moffitt; Wes Nisker; Mary Grace Orr; Sharda Rogell; Donald Rothberg; Tempel Smith; John Travis; Spring Washam; Julie Wester; Diana Winston; and Larry Yang.\n\nA number of Spirit Rock teachers also offer their teachings, or serve on the Board of Directors, at other meditation centers including East Bay Meditation Center in Oakland, California, the Modesto Almond Blossom Sangha in Modesto, California, Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts, Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California, Mountain Stream Meditation Center in Nevada City, California, and Aloka Vihara, a forest monastery of bikkhunis (fully ordained nuns) in the Sierra Foothills of California.\n\n"}
{"id": "405568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=405568", "title": "Structuration theory", "text": "Structuration theory\n\nThe theory of structuration is a social theory of the creation and reproduction of social systems that is based in the analysis of both \"structure\" and \"agents\" (see structure and agency), without giving primacy to either. Further, in structuration theory, neither micro- nor macro-focused analysis alone is sufficient. The theory was proposed by sociologist Anthony Giddens, most significantly in \"The Constitution of Society\", which examines phenomenology, hermeneutics, and social practices at the inseparable intersection of structures and agents. Its proponents have adopted and expanded this balanced position. Though the theory has received much criticism, it remains a pillar of contemporary sociological theory.\nSociologist Anthony Giddens adopted a post-empiricist frame for his theory, as he was concerned with the abstract characteristics of social relations. This leaves each level more accessible to analysis via the ontologies which constitute the human social experience: space and time (\"and thus, in one sense, 'history'.\") His aim was to build a broad social theory which viewed \"[t]he basic domain of study of the social sciences... [as] neither the experience of the individual actor, nor the existence of any form of societal totality, but social practices ordered across space and time.\" His focus on abstract ontology accompanied a general and purposeful neglect of epistemology or detailed research methodology.\n\nGiddens used concepts from objectivist and subjectivist social theories, discarding objectivism's focus on detached structures, which lacked regard for humanist elements and subjectivism's exclusive attention to individual or group agency without consideration for socio-structural context. He critically engaged classical nineteenth and early twentieth century social theorists such as Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Alfred Schutz, Robert K. Merton, Erving Goffman, and Jürgen Habermas. Thus, in many ways, structuration was \"an exercise in clarification of logical issues.\" Structuration drew on other fields, as well: \"He also wanted to bring in from other disciplines novel aspects of ontology that he felt had been neglected by social theorists working in the domains that most interested him. Thus, for example, he enlisted the aid of geographers, historians and philosophers in bringing notions of time and space into the central heartlands of social theory.\" Giddens hoped that a subject-wide \"coming together\" might occur which would involve greater cross-disciplinary dialogue and cooperation, especially between anthropologists, social scientists and sociologists of all types, historians, geographers, and even novelists. Believing that \"literary style matters\", he held that social scientists are communicators who share frames of meaning across cultural contexts through their work by utilising \"the same sources of description (mutual knowledge) as novelists or others who write fictional accounts of social life.\"\n\nStructuration differs from its historical sources. Unlike structuralism it sees the reproduction of social systems not \"as a mechanical outcome, [but] rather ... as an active constituting process, accomplished by, and consisting in, the doings of active subjects.\" Unlike Althusser's concept of agents as \"bearers\" of structures, structuration theory sees them as active participants. Unlike the philosophy of action and other forms of interpretative sociology, structuration focuses on structure rather than production exclusively. Unlike Saussure's production of an utterance, structuration sees language as a tool from which to view society, not as the constitution of society—parting with structural linguists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss and generative grammar theorists such as Noam Chomsky. Unlike post-structuralist theory, which put similar focus on the effects of time and space, structuration does not recognise movement, change and transition. Unlike functionalism, in which structures and their virtual synonyms, \"systems\", comprise organisations, structuration sees structures and systems as separate concepts. Unlike Marxism, structuration avoids an overly restrictive concept of \"society\" and Marxism's reliance on a universal \"motor of history\" (i.e. class conflict), its theories of societal \"adaptation\", and its insistence on the working class as universal class and socialism as the ultimate form of modern society. Finally, \"structuration theory cannot be expected to furnish the moral guarantees that critical theorists sometimes purport to offer.\"\n\nGiddens observed that in social analysis, the term \"structure\" referred generally to \"rules and resources\" and more specifically to \"the structuring properties allowing the 'binding' of time-space in social systems\". These properties make it possible for similar social practices to exist across time and space and that lend them \"systemic\" form. Agents—groups or individuals—draw upon these structures to perform social actions through embedded memory, called \"memory traces\". Memory traces are thus the vehicle through which social actions are carried out. Structure is also, however, the result of these social practices. Thus, Giddens conceives of the \"duality of structure\" as being:\nGiddens uses \"the duality of structure\" (i.e. material/ideational, micro/macro) to emphasize structure's nature as both medium and outcome. Structures exist both internally within agents as memory traces that are the product of phenomenological and hermeneutic inheritance and externally as the manifestation of social actions. Similarly, social structures contain agents and/or are the product of past actions of agents. Giddens holds this duality, alongside \"structure\" and \"system,\" in addition to the concept of recursiveness, as the core of structuration theory. His theory has been adopted by those with structuralist inclinations, but who wish to situate such structures in human practice rather than to reify them as an ideal type or material property. (This is different, for example, from actor–network theory which appears to grant a certain autonomy to technical artifacts.)\n\nSocial systems have patterns of social relation that change over time; the changing nature of space and time determines the interaction of social relations and therefore structure. Hitherto, social structures or models were either taken to be beyond the realm of human control—the positivistic approach—or posit that action creates them—the interpretivist approach. The duality of structure emphasizes that they are different sides to the same central question of how social order is created.\n\nGregor McLennan suggested renaming this process \"the duality of structure \", since both aspects are involved in using and producing social actions.\n\nThe duality of structure is essentially a feedback–feedforward process whereby agents and structures mutually enact social systems, and social systems in turn become part of that duality. Structuration thus recognizes a social cycle. In examining social systems, structuration theory examines \"structure\", \"modality\", and \"interaction\". The \"modality\" (discussed below) of a structural system is the means by which structures are translated into actions.\n\nInteraction is the agent's activity within the social system, space and time. \"It can be understood as the fitful yet routinized occurrence of encounters, fading away in time and space, yet constantly reconstituted within different areas of time-space.\" Rules can affect interaction, as originally suggested by Goffman. \"Frames\" are \"clusters of rules which help to constitute and regulate activities, defining them as activities of a certain sort and as subject to a given range of sanctions.\" Frames are necessary for agents to feel \"ontological security, the trust that everyday actions have some degree of predictability. Whenever individuals interact in a specific context they address—without any difficulty and in many cases without conscious acknowledgement—the question: \"What is going on here?\" Framing is the practice by which agents make sense of what they are doing.\n\nStructuration theory is centrally concerned with \"order\" as \"the transcending of time and space in human social relationships\". \"Institutionalized action\" and \"routinization\" are foundational in the establishment of social order and the reproduction of social systems. Routine persists in society, even during social and political revolutions, where daily life is greatly deformed, \"as Bettelheim demonstrates so well, routines, including those of an obnoxious sort, are re-established.\" Routine interactions become institutionalized features of social systems via tradition, custom and/or habit, but this is no easy societal task and it \"is a major error to suppose that these phenomena need no explanation. On the contrary, as Goffman (together with ethnomethodology) has helped to demonstrate, the routinized character of most social activity is something that has to be 'worked at' continually by those who sustain it in their day-to-day conduct.\" Therefore, routinized social practices do not stem from coincidence, \"but the skilled accomplishments of knowledgeable agents.\"\n\n\"Trust\" and \"tact\" are essential for the existence of a \"basic security system, the sustaining (in \"praxis\") of a sense of ontological security, and [thus] the routine nature of social reproduction which agents skilfully organize. The monitoring of the body, the control and use of face in 'face work'—these are fundamental to social integration in time and space.\"\n\nThus, even the smallest social actions contribute to the alteration or reproduction of social systems. Social stability and order is not permanent; agents always possess a \"dialectic of control\" (discussed below) which allows them to break away from normative actions. Depending on the social factors present, agents may cause shifts in social structure.\n\nThe cycle of structuration is not a defined sequence; it is rarely a direct succession of causal events. Structures and agents are both internal and external to each other, mingling, interrupting, and continually changing each other as feedbacks and feedforwards occur. Giddens stated, \"The degree of \"systemness\" is very variable. ...I take it to be one of the main features of structuration theory that the extension and 'closure' of societies across space and time is regarded as problematic.\"\n\nThe use of \"patriot\" in political speech reflects this mingling, borrowing from and contributing to nationalistic norms and supports structures such as a police state, from which it in turn gains impact.\n\nStructures are the \"rules and resources\" embedded in agents' memory traces. Agents call upon their memory traces of which they are \"knowledgeable\" to perform social actions. \"Knowledgeability\" refers to \"what agents know about what they do, and why they do it.\" Giddens divides memory traces (\"structures-within-knowledgeability\") into three types:\n\nWhen an agent uses these structures for social interactions, they are called \"modalities\" and present themselves in the forms of facility (domination), interpretive scheme/communication (signification) and norms/sanctions (legitimation).\n\nThus, he distinguishes between overall \"structures-within-knowledgeability\" and the more limited and task-specific \"modalities\" on which these agents subsequently draw when they interact.\n\nThe duality of structures means that structures enter \"simultaneously into the constitution of the agent and social practices, and 'exists' in the generating moments of this constitution.\" \"Structures exist paradigmatically, as an absent set of differences, temporally \"present\" only in their instantiation, in the constituting moments of social systems.\" Giddens draws upon structuralism and post-structuralism in theorizing that structures and their meaning are understood by their differences.\n\nGiddens' agents follow previous psychoanalysis work done by Sigmund Freud and others. Agency, as Giddens calls it, is human action. To be human is to be an agent (not all agents are human). Agency is critical to both the reproduction and the transformation of society. Another way to explain this concept is by what Giddens calls the \"reflexive monitoring of actions.\" \"Reflexive monitoring\" refers to agents' ability to monitor their actions and those actions' settings and contexts. Monitoring is an essential characteristic of agency. Agents subsequently \"rationalize,\" or evaluate, the success of those efforts. All humans engage in this process, and expect the same from others. Through action, agents produce structures; through reflexive monitoring and rationalization, they transform them. To act, agents must be motivated, must be knowledgeable must be able to rationalize the action; and must reflexively monitor the action.\n\nAgents, while bounded in structure, draw upon their knowledge of that structural context when they act. However, actions are constrained by agents' inherent capabilities and their understandings of available actions and external limitations. \"Practical consciousness\" and \"discursive consciousness\" inform these abilities. Practical consciousness is the knowledgeability that an agent brings to the tasks required by everyday life, which is so integrated as to be hardly noticed. Reflexive monitoring occurs at the level of practical consciousness. Discursive consciousness is the ability to verbally express knowledge. Alongside practical and discursive consciousness, Giddens recognizes actors as having reflexive, contextual knowledge, and that habitual, widespread use of knowledgeability makes structures become institutionalized.\n\nAgents rationalize, and in doing so, link the agent and the agent's knowledgeability. Agents must coordinate ongoing projects, goals, and contexts while performing actions. This coordination is called reflexive monitoring and is connected to ethnomethodology's emphasis on agents' intrinsic sense of accountability.\n\nThe factors that can enable or constrain an agent, as well as how an agent uses structures, are known as \"capability constraints\" include age, cognitive/physical limits on performing multiple tasks at once and the physical impossibility of being in multiple places at once, available time and the relationship between movement in space and movement in time.\n\nLocation offers are a particular type of capability constraint. Examples include:\n\nAgents are always able to engage in a \"dialectic of control\", able to \"intervene in the world or to refrain from such intervention, with the effect of influencing a specific process or state of affairs.\" In essence, agents experience inherent and contrasting amounts of autonomy and dependence; agents can always either act or not.\n\nStructuration theory is relevant to research, but does not prescribe a methodology and its use in research has been problematic. Giddens intended his theory to be abstract and theoretical, informing the hermeneutic aspects of research rather than guiding practice. Giddens wrote that structuration theory \"establishes the internal logical coherence of concepts within a theoretical network.\" Giddens criticized many researchers who used structuration theory for empirical research, critiquing their \"en bloc\" use of the theory's abstract concepts in a burdensome way. \"The works applying concepts from the logical framework of structuration theory that Giddens approved of were those that used them more selectively, 'in a spare and critical fashion.'\" Giddens and followers used structuration theory more as \"a sensitizing device\".\n\nStructuration theory allows researchers to focus on any structure or concept individually or in combination. In this way, structuration theory prioritizes ontology over epistemology. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. He looked for stasis and change, agent expectations, relative degrees of routine, tradition, behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, intended and unintended consequences, skilled and knowledgeable agents, discursive and tacit knowledge, dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints. Structuration theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as cherry-picking.\n\nGiddens preferred \"strategic conduct analysis\", which focuses on contextually situated actions. It employs detailed accounts of agents' knowledgeability, motivation, and the dialectic of control.\n\nThough structuration theory has received critical expansion since its origination, Giddens' concepts remained pivotal for later extension of the theory, especially the duality of structure.\n\nRob Stones argued that many aspects of Gidden's original theory had little place in its modern manifestation. Stones focused on clarifying its scope, reconfiguring some concepts and inserting new ones, and refining methodology and research orientations. Strong structuration:\n\nMargaret Archer objected to the inseparability of structure and agency in structuration theory. She proposed a notion of \"dualism\" rather than \"duality of structure\". She primarily examined structural frameworks and the action within the limits allowed by those conditions. She combined realist ontology and called her methodology \"analytical dualism\". Archer maintained that structure precedes agency in social structure reproduction and analytical importance, and that they should be analysed separately. She emphasised the importance of temporality in social analysis, dividing it into four stages: structural conditioning, social interaction, its immediate outcome and structural elaboration. Thus her analysis considered embedded \"structural conditions, emergent causal powers and properties, social interactions between agents, and subsequent structural changes or reproductions arising from the latter.\" Archer criticised structuration theory for denying time and place because of the inseparability between structure and agency.\n\nNicos Mouzelis reconstructed Giddens' original theories. Mouzelis kept Giddens' original formulation of structure as \"rules and resources.\" However, he was considered a dualist, because he argued for dualism to be as important in social analysis as the duality of structure. Mouzelis reexamined human social action at the \"syntagmatic\" (syntactic) level. He claimed that the duality of structure does not account for all types of social relationships. Duality of structure works when agents do not question or disrupt rules, and interaction resembles \"natural/performative\" actions with a practical orientation. However, in other contexts, the relationship between structure and agency can resemble dualism more than duality, such as systems that are the result of powerful agents. In these situations, rules are not viewed as resources, but are in states of transition or redefinition, where actions are seen from a \"strategic/monitoring orientation.\" In this orientation, dualism shows the distance between agents and structures. He called these situations \"syntagmatic duality\". For example, a professor can change the class he or she teaches, but has little capability to change the larger university structure. \"In that case, syntagmatic duality gives way to syntagmatic dualism.\" This implies that systems are the outcome, but not the medium, of social actions. Mouzelis also criticised Giddens' lack of consideration for social hierarchies.\n\nJohn Parker built on Archer and Mouzelis's support for dualism to propose a theoretical reclamation of historical sociology and macro-structures using concrete historical cases, claiming that dualism better explained the dynamics of social structures. Equally, Robert Archer developed and applied analytical dualism in his critical analysis of the impact of New Managerialism on education policy in England in Wales during the 1990s.\n\nThough he agreed with the soundness and overall purposes of Giddens' most expansive structuration concepts (i.e., against dualism and for the study of structure in concert with agency), John B. Thompson (\"a close friend and colleague of Giddens at Cambridge University\") wrote one of the most widely cited critiques of structuration theory. His central argument was that it needed to be more specific and more consistent both internally and with conventional social structure theory. Thompson focused on problematic aspects of Giddens' concept of structure as \"rules and resources,\" focusing on \"rules\". He argued that Giddens' concept of rule was too broad.\n\nThompson claimed that Giddens presupposed a \"criterion of importance\" in contending that rules are a generalizable enough tool to apply to every aspect of human action and interaction; \"on the other hand, Giddens is well aware that rules, or some kinds or aspects of rules, are much more important than others for the analysis of, for example, the social structure of capitalist societies.\" He found the term to be imprecise and to not designate which rules are more relevant for which social structures.\n\nThompson used the example of linguistic analysis to point out that the need for a prior framework which to enable analysis of, for example, the social structure of an entire nation. While semantic rules may be relevant to social structure, to study them \"presupposes some structural points of reference which are not themselves , with regard to which [of] these semantic rules are differentiated\" according to class, sex, region and so on. He called this \"structural differentiation.\"\n\nRules differently affect variously situated individuals. Thompson gave the example of a private school which restricts enrollment and thus participation. Thus rules—in this case, restrictions—\"operate , affecting unevenly various groups of individuals whose categorization depends on certain assumptions about social structures.\" The isolated analysis of rules does not incorporate differences among agents.\n\nThompson claimed that Giddens offered no way of formulating \"structural identity\". Some \"rules\" are better conceived of as broad inherent elements that define a structure's identity (e.g., Henry Ford and Harold Macmillan are \"capitalistic\"). These agents may differ, but have important traits in common due to their \"capitalistic\" identity. Thompson theorized that these traits were not rules in the sense that a manager could draw upon a \"rule\" to fire a tardy employee; rather, they were which \" the kinds of rules which are possible and which thereby the scope for institutional variation.\" It is necessary to outline the broader social system to be able to analyze agents, actors, and rules within that system.\n\nThus Thompson concluded that Giddens' use of the term \"rules\" is problematic. \"Structure\" is similarly objectionable: \"But to adhere to this conception of structure, while at the same time acknowledging the need for the study of 'structural principles,' 'structural sets' and 'axes of structuration,' is simply a recipe for conceptual confusion.\"\n\nThompson proposed several amendments. He requested sharper differentiation between the reproduction of institutions and the reproduction of social structure. He proposed an altered version of the structuration cycle. He defined \"institutions\" as \"characterized by rules, regulations and conventions of various sorts, by differing kinds and quantities of resources and by hierarchical power relations between the occupants of institutional positions.\" Agents acting within institutions and conforming to institutional rules and regulations or using institutionally endowed power reproduce the institution. \"If, in so doing, the institutions continue to satisfy certain structural conditions, both in the sense of conditions which delimit the scope for \"institutional variation\" and the conditions which underlie the operation of \"structural differentiation\", then the agents may be said to reproduce social structure.\"\n\nThompson also proposed adding a \"range of alternatives\" to Giddens' conception of constraints on human action. He pointed out the paradoxical relationship between Giddens' \"dialectic of control\" and his acknowledgement that constraints may leave an agent with no choice. He demanded that Giddens better show how wants and desires relate to choice.\n\nGiddens replied that a structural principle is not equivalent with rules, and pointed to his definition from \"A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism\": \"Structural principles are principles of organisation implicated in those practices most \"deeply\" (in time) and \"pervasively\" (in space) sedimented in society\", and described structuration as a \"mode of institutional articulation\" with emphasis on the relationship between time and space and a host of institutional orderings including, but not limited to, rules.\n\nUltimately, Thompson concluded that the concept of structure as \"rules and resources\" in an elemental and ontological way resulted in conceptual confusion. Many theorists supported Thompson's argument that an analysis \"based on structuration's ontology of structures as norms, interpretative schemes and power resources radically limits itself if it does not frame and locate itself within a more broadly conceived notion of social structures.\"\n\nSewell provided a useful summary that included one of the theory's less specified aspects: the question \"Why are structural transformations possible?\" He claimed that Giddens' overrelied on rules and modified Giddens' argument by re-defining \"resources\" as the embodiment of cultural schemas. He argued that change arises from the multiplicity of structures, the \"transposable\" nature of schemas, the unpredictability of resource accumulation, the polysemy of resources and the intersection of structures.\n\nThe existence of multiple structures implies that the knowledgeable agents whose actions produce systems are capable of applying different schemas to contexts with differing resources, contrary to the conception of a universal habitus (learned dispositions, skills and ways of acting). He wrote that \"Societies are based on practices that derived from many distinct structures, which exist at different levels, operate in different modalities, and are themselves based on widely varying types and quantities of resources. ...It is never true that all of them are homologous.\"\n\nOriginally from Bourdieu, \"transposable\" schemas can be \"applied to a wide and not fully predictable range of cases outside the context in which they were initially learned.\" That capacity \"is inherent in the knowledge of cultural schemas that characterizes all minimally competent members of society.\"\n\nAgents may modify schemas even though their use does not predictably accumulate resources. For example, the effect of a joke is never quite certain, but a comedian may alter it based on the amount of laughter it garners regardless of this variability.\n\nAgents may interpret a particular resource according to different schemas. E.g., a commander could attribute his wealth to military prowess, while others could see it as a blessing from the gods or a coincidental initial advantage.\n\nStructures often overlap, confusing interpretation (e.g., the structure of capitalist society includes production from both private property and worker solidarity).\n\nThis theory was adapted and augmented by researchers interested in the relationship between technology and social structures, such as information technology in organizations. DeSanctis and Poole proposed an \"adaptive structuration theory\" with respect to the emergence and use of group decision support systems. In particular, they chose Giddens' notion of modalities to consider how technology is used with respect to its \"spirit\". \"Appropriations\" are the immediate, visible actions that reveal deeper structuration processes and are enacted with \"moves\". Appropriations may be faithful or unfaithful, be instrumental and be used with various attitudes.\n\nWanda Orlikowski applied her critique of the duality of structure to technology: \"The duality of technology identifies prior views of technology as either objective force or as socially constructed product–as a false dichotomy.\" She compared this to previous models (the technological imperative, strategic choice, and technology as a trigger) and considered the importance of meaning, power, norms, and interpretive flexibility. Orlikowski later replaced the notion of embedded properties for enactment (use). The \"practice lens\" shows how people enact structures which shape their use of technology that they employ in their practices. While Orlikowski's work focused on corporations, it is equally applicable to the technology cultures that have emerged in smaller community-based organizations, and can be adapted through the \"gender sensitivity lens\" in approaches to technology governance.\n\nWorkman, Ford and Allen rearticulated structuration theory as \"structuration agency theory\" for modeling socio-biologically inspired structuration in security software. Software agents join humans to engage in social actions of information exchange, giving and receiving instructions, responding to other agents, and pursuing goals individually or jointly.\n\nPavlou and Majchrzak argued that research on business-to-business e-commerce portrayed technology as overly deterministic. The authors employed structuration theory to re-examine outcomes such as economic/business success as well as trust, coordination, innovation, and shared knowledge. They looked beyond technology into organizational structure and practices, and examined the effects on the structure of adapting to new technologies. The authors held that technology needs to be aligned and compatible with the existing \"trustworthy\" practices and organizational and market structure. The authors recommended measuring long-term adaptations using ethnography, monitoring and other methods to observe causal relationships and generate better predictions.\n\nPoole, Seibold, and McPhee wrote that \"group structuration theory,\" provides \"a theory of group interaction commensurate with the complexities of the phenomenon.\"\n\nThe theory attempts to integrate macrosocial theories and individuals or small groups, as well as how to avoid the binary categorization of either \"stable\" or \"emergent\" groups.\n\nWaldeck et al. concluded that the theory needs to better predict outcomes, rather than merely explaining them. \"Decision rules\" support decision-making, which produces a communication pattern that can be directly observable. Research has not yet examined the \"rational\" function of group communication and decision-making (i.e., how well it achieves goals), nor structural production or constraints. Researchers must empirically demonstrate the recursivity of action and structure, examine how structures stabilize and change over time due to group communication, and may want to integrate argumentation research.\n\nFalkheimer claimed that integrating structuration theory into public relations (PR) strategies could result in a less agency-driven business, return theoretical focus to the role of power structures in PR, and reject massive PR campaigns in favor of a more \"holistic understanding of how PR may be used in local contexts both as a reproductive and [transformational] social instrument.\" Falkheimer portrayed PR as a method of communication and action whereby social systems emerge and reproduce. Structuration theory reinvigorates the study of space and time in PR theory. Applied structuration theory may emphasize community-based approaches, storytelling, rituals, and informal communication systems. Moreover, structuration theory integrates all organizational members in PR actions, integrating PR into all organizational levels rather than a separate office. Finally, structuration reveals interesting ethical considerations relating to whether a social system transform.\n\n"}
{"id": "12224008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12224008", "title": "Sufi psychology", "text": "Sufi psychology\n\nThere are three central ideas in Sufi Islamic psychology, which are the Nafs (self, ego or psyche), the Qalb (heart) and the Ruh (spirit). The origin and basis of these terms is Qur'anic and they have been expounded upon by centuries of Sufic commentaries.\nNafs is considered to be the lowest principle of man. Higher than the nafs is the Qalb (heart), and the Ruh (spirit). This tripartition forms the foundation of later, more complicated systems; it is found as early as the Koranic commentary by Ja'far al-Sadiq. He holds that the nafs is peculiar to the zalim (tyrant), the qalb to the muqtasid (moderate), and the rūh to the sābiq (preceding one, winner); the zālim loves God for his own sake, the muqtasid loves Him for Himself, and the sābiq annihilates his own will in God's will. Bayezid Bistami, Hakīm at-Tirmidhī, and Junayd have followed this tripartition. Kharrāz, however, inserts between nafs and qalb the element tab', \"nature,\" the natural functions of man. The spiritual body (soul) was created in adult form of the living body.\n\nAt almost the same time in history, Nūrī saw in man four different aspects of the heart, which he derived from the Koran:\n\n\"Sadr (breast) is connected with Islam (Sūra 39:23); qalb (heart) is the seat of īmān (faith) (Sūra 49:7; 16:106); fuad (heart) is connected with marifa (gnosis) (Sūra 53:11); and lubb (innermost heart) is the seat of tauhīd (Sūra 3:190).\"\n\nThe Sufis often add the element of sirr, the innermost part of the heart in which the divine revelation is experienced. Jafar introduced, in an interesting comparison, reason, aql, as the barrier between nafs and qalb -- \"the barrier which they both cannot transcend\" (Sūra 55:20), so that the dark lower instincts cannot jeopardize the heart's purity. Each of these spiritual centers has its own functions, and Amr al-Makkī has summed up some of the early Sufi ideas in a myth:\n\n\"God created the hearts seven thousand years before the bodies and kept them in the station of proximity to Himself and He created the spirits seven thousand years before the hearts and kept them in the garden of intimate fellowship (uns) with Himself, and the consciences—the innermost part—He created seven thousand years before the spirits and kept them in the degree of union (waṣl) with Himself. Then he imprisoned the conscience in the spirit and the spirit in the heart and the heart in the body. Then He tested them and sent prophets, and then each began to seek its own station. The body occupied itself with prayer, the heart attained to love, the spirit arrived at proximity to its Lord, and the innermost part found rest in union with Him\".\n\n\"Nafs\" (self or ego) is the aspect of the psyche that can be viewed along a continuum, and has the potential of functioning from the grossest to the highest level. The self at its lowest level refers to our negative traits and tendencies, controlled by emotions, desires and its gratification. Sufic psychology identifies seven levels of the nafs, which have been identified in the Quran. The process of growth depends on working through these levels. These are: tyrannical self, regretful self, inspired self, serene self, pleased self, pleasing self and the pure self.\n\nIn Sufi psychology the heart refers to the spiritual heart or \"qalb\", not the physical organ. It is this spiritual heart that contains the deeper intelligence and wisdom. It holds the Divine spark or spirit and is the place of gnosis and deep spiritual knowledge. In Sufism, the goal is to develop a heart that is sincere, loving and compassionate, and to develop the heart's intelligence, which is deeper, and more grounded than the rational, abstract intelligence of the mind. Just as the physical heart supplies blood to the body, the spiritual heart nourishes the soul with wisdom and spiritual light, and it also purifies the gross personality traits. According to Sufic psychology emotions are from the self or nafs, not from the heart.\nThe qalb mediates between the Nafs and spirit. Its task is control the nafs and direct the man toward the spirit.\n\nThe spirit \"ruh\" is in direct connection with the Divine, even if one is unconscious of that connection. The spirit has seven levels or facets of the complete spirit. These levels are: mineral, vegetable, animal, personal, human, secret and secret of secret souls. Each level represents the stages of evolution, and the process that it goes through in its growth. The spirit is holistic, and extends to all aspects of the person, i.e. the body, the mind and the soul. Each level of the spirit has valuable gifts and strengths, as well as weaknesses. The goal is to develop the strengths and to achieve a balance between these levels, not forgoing the lower ones to focus only on the higher ones. In traditional psychology, Ego psychology deals with the animal soul, Behavioral psychology focuses on the conditioned functioning of the vegetable and animal soul, Cognitive psychology deals with the mental functions of the personal soul, Humanistic psychology deals with the activities of the human soul and Transpersonal psychology deals with ego-transcending consciousness of the secret soul and the secret of secret souls.\nSpirit is beyond the realm of creation. It is directly connected with Alam e Lahoot(Unity of attributes and names) which is from Amr Allah (Command of Allah), Therefore Spirit already knows everything including its own source.\n\nSufism aspires towards developing a soft, feeling, compassionate heart. Understanding through the ‘‘heart’s intelligence’’ is superior to understanding through the intelligence of the head. Indeed, the intelligence of the heart is the only instrument that can be used to discover the ultimate truth. To Sufis, reason is limited in many ways and cannot outgrow its inherent limitations. In particular, when reason denies intuitive knowledge and ‘‘blinds the eye of the heart’’, it becomes the target of strong criticism from Sufism. This stands in stark contrast to the Aristotelian and contemporary western emphasis on logical reasoning as the highest human faculty, which should rule the whole personality. On this basis, happiness cannot be achieved by reason and intellect, rather happiness is pursued via intuition and mystical experience. Another important concept in Sufism is the ego (the self or the nafs). The ego is a part of our psyche that consistently leads us off the spiritual path, a part of the self which commands us to do evil. The ego can impede the actualization of the spiritual potential of the heart if not controlled by the divine aspects of the personality. To achieve authentic happiness, the ego should be actively fought against throughout life. The ultimate state of happiness for a Sufi is the annihilation of the individual self. This state refers to the destruction of the individual self to become one with the Divine Being.\n\nOne of the most influential Sufi psychologists was Al-Ghazali (1058–1111). He discussed the concept of the self and the causes of its misery and happiness.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Huizhou, Guangdong, and moved to Hong Kong in 1959 at the age of four. He teaches General Education courses in the Chinese University of Hong Kong as a full-time professor since 1990 and retired in 2015 to be a part-time assistant professor. He founded the Philosophia Cultural Society () with other University lecturers in 2001 and is also a council member of Society for Life and Death Education. He publishes articles in a special column \"Philosophy in an array of stars\" () in the \"Hong Kong Economic Journal\" and in \"Ming Pao\".\n\n\n\nTao is renowned for his witty and humorous teaching style. \"Philosophy of Love\" and \"Death and Immorality\" are popular courses among students in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\n\"Analyze love in a solemn philosophical way\" () is what Tao aimed to do when he started the course \"Philosophy of Love\". In philosophy, topics like freedom, death and democracy are widely discussed in depth. Yet, people rarely interpret 'love' in philosophy, probably because philosophers are not experienced in love, and that they like to talk about the love in ethics and morality, but not the love between people. Also, it is difficult for philosophers to analyze “Love” as it cannot be explained by theories or other rather rational methods. Therefore, Tao aspired to fill the vacuum in philosophy by investigating the unexplored topic of love.\n\nThough death is much discussed in the field of philosophy, it is not brought up to a great concern in Hong Kong, because 'death' is a traditional Chinese taboo word, where people do not usually mention it in public but keep it as a topic to be discussed in private. Being diagnosed with nephrosis at an early age, Tao particularly sympathizes with the topic of 'death' where he constantly suffers from pain. Since the 1990s, he has been teaching the course “Death and Immorality” and keep modifying it. At first, he attempted to categorize deaths conscientiously, such as chronic disease, suicide, sudden death. Recent years, he switched to a more relaxing and interactive teaching style, in which he would talk about the unfortunate death of male or female protagonists in romantic story, invite masters in Buddhism to share a religious view of death and organize a workshop for students to feel death. Tao has been teaching this course for over twenty years, he concluded his insights about death in a University talk, he said “When people talk about death, it is very easy for them to view it as ‘others’ death, thus neglect its personal meaning. In fact, death is the reflection of humans on their own existence, we should treat it as a memory of life and let it be our motivation to live, it might change your views on the world\" ().\n\nTao uses terse and clear language to illustrate complex philosophical theories in both Chinese and Western world to readers, such as metaphysics, phenomenal and neo-Confucianism. Since Tao mainly writes about Philosophical theories, he keeps his language in an objective manner and seldom reveals personal feelings in his works. His works are well-structured and served as introductory books to beginners in Philosophy. For instance, in his most up-to-date book \"Post-80s·The Blind Spot of Love\" (), incorporated simple ideas in Philosophy, Psychology, and Sociology in analysing the development of mentality in the post-1980s generation. Hence, portrays the phenomenon of love in the post-1980s generation and unlocks their sentimental world.\n\nThough Tao uses plain words, his works are poetic and lively, which challenge the perception that Philosophy is meant to be solemn. In \"The Foreignness of Philosophy\" () , the famous line \"Foreignness is the oblivion over a long period of time, they do not know who they are as being long in their bustling real-life. \" () reflects Tao's use of simple yet beautiful Chinese in explaining Phenomenon in Philosophy. \"I existed, life in here, it has no beginning or an end, it cannot be depended upon something else, it is the most natural and primitive bounce; it is filled with passion, that needs to be expressed entirely\" (), gives readers a vivid impression of the excitement in possessing life.\n\n\n"}

The title alludes to one of Zeno's paradoxes of motion, in which Achilles could never overtake the tortoise in a race. In Carroll's dialogue, the tortoise challenges Achilles to use the force of logic to make him accept the conclusion of a simple deductive argument. Ultimately, Achilles fails, because the clever tortoise leads him into an infinite regression.\n\nThe discussion begins by considering the following logical argument:\n\nThe Tortoise asks Achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and Achilles grants that it obviously does. The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether there might be a reader of Euclid who grants that the argument is \"logically valid\", as a \"sequence\", while denying that \"A\" and \"B\" are true. Achilles accepts that such a reader might exist, and that he would hold that \"if\" \"A\" and \"B\" are true, \"then\" \"Z\" must be true, while not yet accepting that \"A\" and \"B\" are true (that is, a reader who denies the premises).\n\nThe Tortoise then asks Achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist, who accepts that \"A\" and \"B\" are true, but who does \"not\" yet accept the principle that \"if\" \"A\" and \"B\" are both true, \"then\" \"Z\" must be true. Achilles grants the Tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist. The Tortoise, then, asks Achilles to treat the Tortoise as a reader of this second kind. Achilles must now logically compel the Tortoise to accept that \"Z\" must be true. (The tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself; the syllogism's conclusion, structure, or validity.)\n\nAfter writing down \"A\", \"B\", and \"Z\" in his notebook, Achilles asks the Tortoise to accept the hypothetical:\n\nThe Tortoise agrees to accept \"C\", if Achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook, making the new argument:\n\nBut now that the Tortoise accepts premise \"C\", it still refuses to accept the expanded argument. When Achilles demands that \"If you accept \"A\" and \"B\" and \"C\", you must accept \"Z\",\" the Tortoise remarks that that's \"another\" hypothetical proposition, and suggests even if it accepts \"C\", it could still fail to conclude \"Z\" if it did not see the truth of:\n\nThe Tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once Achilles writes it down, but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows, since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true, \"Z\" must be true:\nThus, the list of premises continues to grow without end, leaving the argument always in the form:\n\nAt each step, the Tortoise argues that even though he accepts all the premises that have been written down, there is some further premise (that if all of (1)–(\"n\") are true, then (\"Z\") must be true) that it still needs to accept before it is compelled to accept that (\"Z\") is true.\n\nLewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from \"modus ponens\" deductions. \nOr, in words: proposition \"P\" (is true) implies \"Q\" (is true), and given \"P\", therefore \"Q\".\n\nThe regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here modus ponens, and once \"that\" principle is explained, \"another\" principle is required to explain \"that\" principle. Thus, if the causal chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a rule of inference defined by the system, then it can be abided by simply because it is so. For example, chess has particular rules that simply go without question and players must abide by them because they form the very framework of the game. Likewise, a formal system of logic is defined by rules that are to be followed, by definition, without question. Having a defined formal system of logic stops the infinite regressionthat is, the regression stops at the axioms or rules, per se, of the given game, system, etc.\n\nIn propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows:\n\nP implies Q if and only if the proposition \"not P or Q\" is a tautology.\n\nHence de modus ponens, [P ∧ (P → Q)] ⇒ Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The Tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.\n\nIn addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.\n\nSome logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the conditional connective and the implication relation. These logicians use the phrase \"not p or q\" for the conditional connective and the term \"implies\" for an asserted implication relation.\n\nSeveral philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll's paradox. Bertrand Russell discussed the paradox briefly in § 38 of \"The Principles of Mathematics\" (1903), distinguishing between \"implication\" (associated with the form \"if \"p\", then \"q\"), which he held to be a relation between \"unasserted\" propositions, and \"inference\" (associated with the form \"p\", therefore \"q\"\"), which he held to be a relation between \"asserted\" propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise's attempt to treat \"inferring\" \"Z\" from \"A\" and \"B\" as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the \"hypothetical\" \"If \"A\" and \"B\" are true, then \"Z\" is true.\"\n\nThe Wittgensteinian philosopher Peter Winch discussed the paradox in \"The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy\" (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that \"the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning \"to do\" something\" (p. 57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper \"application\" of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of \"further\" rules, and so that \"a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts\" (p. 53).\n\nCarroll's dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to conventionalism about logical truth, later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by W.V.O. Quine.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45754", "title": "Where Mathematics Comes From", "text": "Where Mathematics Comes From\n\nWhere Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being (hereinafter \"WMCF\") is a book by George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist, and Rafael E. Núñez, a psychologist. Published in 2000, \"WMCF\" seeks to found a cognitive science of mathematics, a theory of embodied mathematics based on conceptual metaphor.\n\nMathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:\n\nNikolay Lobachevsky said \"There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.\" A common type of conceptual blending process would seem to apply to the entire mathematical procession.\n\nLakoff and Núñez's avowed purpose is to begin laying the foundations for a truly scientific understanding of mathematics, one grounded in processes common to all human cognition. They find that four distinct but related processes metaphorically structure basic arithmetic: object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and moving along a path.\n\n\"WMCF\" builds on earlier books by Lakoff (1987) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), which analyze such concepts of metaphor and image schemata from second-generation cognitive science. Some of the concepts in these earlier books, such as the interesting technical ideas in Lakoff (1987), are absent from \"WMCF\".\n\nLakoff and Núñez hold that mathematics results from the human cognitive apparatus and must therefore be understood in cognitive terms. \"WMCF\" advocates (and includes some examples of) a \"cognitive idea analysis\" of mathematics which analyzes mathematical ideas in terms of the human experiences, metaphors, generalizations, and other cognitive mechanisms giving rise to them. A standard mathematical education does not develop such idea analysis techniques because it does not pursue considerations of A) what structures of the mind allow it to do mathematics or B) the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nLakoff and Núñez start by reviewing the psychological literature, concluding that human beings appear to have an innate ability, called subitizing, to count, add, and subtract up to about 4 or 5. They document this conclusion by reviewing the literature, published in recent decades, describing experiments with infant subjects. For example, infants quickly become excited or curious when presented with \"impossible\" situations, such as having three toys appear when only two were initially present.\n\nThe authors argue that mathematics goes far beyond this very elementary level due to a large number of metaphorical constructions. For example, the Pythagorean position that all is number, and the associated crisis of confidence that came about with the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two, arises solely from a metaphorical relation between the length of the diagonal of a square, and the possible numbers of objects.\n\nMuch of \"WMCF\" deals with the important concepts of infinity and of limit processes, seeking to explain how finite humans living in a finite world could ultimately conceive of the actual infinite. Thus much of \"WMCF\" is, in effect, a study of the epistemological foundations of the calculus. Lakoff and Núñez conclude that while the potential infinite is not metaphorical, the actual infinite is. Moreover, they deem all manifestations of actual infinity to be instances of what they call the \"Basic Metaphor of Infinity\", as represented by the ever-increasing sequence 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n\"WMCF\" emphatically rejects the Platonistic philosophy of mathematics. They emphasize that all we know and can ever know is \"human mathematics\", the mathematics arising from the human intellect. The question of whether there is a \"transcendent\" mathematics independent of human thought is a meaningless question, like asking if colors are transcendent of human thought—colors are only varying wavelengths of light, it is our interpretation of physical stimuli that make them colors.\n\n\"WMCF\" (p. 81) likewise criticizes the emphasis mathematicians place on the concept of closure. Lakoff and Núñez argue that the expectation of closure is an artifact of the human mind's ability to relate fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.\n\n\"WMCF\" concerns itself mainly with proposing and establishing an alternative view of mathematics, one grounding the field in the realities of human biology and experience. It is not a work of technical mathematics or philosophy. Lakoff and Núñez are not the first to argue that conventional approaches to the philosophy of mathematics are flawed. For example, they do not seem all that familiar with the content of Davis and Hersh (1981), even though the book warmly acknowledges Hersh's support.\n\nLakoff and Núñez cite Saunders Mac Lane (the inventor, with Samuel Eilenberg, of category theory) in support of their position. \"Mathematics, Form and Function\" (1986), an overview of mathematics intended for philosophers, proposes that mathematical concepts are ultimately grounded in ordinary human activities, mostly interactions with the physical world.\n\nEducators have taken some interest in what \"WMCF\" suggests about how mathematics is learned, and why students find some elementary concepts more difficult than others.\n\nConceptual metaphors described in \"WMCF\", in addition to the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, include:\nMathematical reasoning requires variables ranging over some universe of discourse, so that we can reason about generalities rather than merely about particulars. \"WMCF\" argues that reasoning with such variables implicitly relies on what it terms the Fundamental Metonymy of Algebra.\n\n\"WMCF\" (p. 151) includes the following example of what the authors term \"metaphorical ambiguity.\" Take the set formula_1 Then recall two bits of standard terminology from elementary set theory:\nBy (1), \"A\" is the set {1,2}. But (1) and (2) together say that \"A\" is also the ordered pair (0,1). Both statements cannot be correct; the ordered pair (0,1) and the unordered pair {1,2} are fully distinct concepts. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) term this situation \"metaphorically ambiguous.\" This simple example calls into question any Platonistic foundations for mathematics.\n\nWhile (1) and (2) above are admittedly canonical, especially within the consensus set theory known as the Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatization, \"WMCF\" does not let on that they are but one of several definitions that have been proposed since the dawning of set theory. For example, Frege, \"Principia Mathematica\", and New Foundations (a body of axiomatic set theory begun by Quine in 1937) define cardinals and ordinals as equivalence classes under the relations of equinumerosity and similarity, so that this conundrum does not arise. In Quinian set theory, \"A\" is simply an instance of the number 2. For technical reasons, defining the ordered pair as in (2) above is awkward in Quinian set theory. Two solutions have been proposed:\n\nThe \"Romance of Mathematics\" is \"WMCF\"s light-hearted term for a perennial philosophical viewpoint about mathematics which the authors describe and then dismiss as an intellectual myth:\n\nIt is very much an open question whether \"WMCF\" will eventually prove to be the start of a new school in the philosophy of mathematics. Hence the main value of \"WMCF\" so far may be a critical one: its critique of Platonism and romanticism in mathematics.\n\nMany working mathematicians resist the approach and conclusions of Lakoff and Núñez. Reviews by mathematicians of \"WMCF\" in professional journals, while often respectful of its focus on conceptual strategies and metaphors as paths for understanding mathematics, have taken exception to some of the \"WMCF\"s philosophical arguments on the grounds that mathematical statements have lasting 'objective' meanings. For example, Fermat's last theorem means exactly what it meant when Fermat initially proposed it 1664. Other reviewers have pointed out that multiple conceptual strategies can be employed in connection with the same mathematically defined term, often by the same person (a point that is compatible with the view that we routinely understand the 'same' concept with different metaphors). The metaphor and the conceptual strategy are not the same as the formal definition which mathematicians employ. However, \"WMCF\" points out that formal definitions are built using words and symbols that have meaning only in terms of human experience.\n\nCritiques of \"WMCF\" include the humorous:\nand the physically informed:\n\nLakoff made his reputation by linking linguistics to cognitive science and the analysis of metaphor. Núñez, educated in Switzerland, is a product of Jean Piaget's school of cognitive psychology as a basis for logic and mathematics. Núñez has thought much about the foundations of real analysis, the real and complex numbers, and the Basic Metaphor of Infinity. These topics, however, worthy though they be, form part of the superstructure of mathematics. Cognitive science should take more interest in the foundations of mathematics. And indeed, the authors do pay a fair bit of attention early on to logic, Boolean algebra and the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, even lingering a bit over group theory. But neither author is well-trained in logic (there is no index entry for \"quantifier\" or \"quantification\"), the philosophy of set theory, the axiomatic method, metamathematics, and model theory. Nor does \"WMCF\" say enough about the derivation of number systems (the Peano axioms go unmentioned), abstract algebra, equivalence and order relations, mereology, topology, and geometry.\n\nLakoff and Núñez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about \"WMCF\", because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and Núñez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.\n\nIt has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that \"WMCF\" establishes that the claim \"intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability\" is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by Keith Devlin among others. The authors of \"WMCF\" have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.\n\nLakoff and Núñez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which intuitionists and constructivists have anticipated their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. Brouwer, the founder of the intuitionist/constructivist point of view, in his dissertation \"On the Foundation of Mathematics\", argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to upbraid the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. Symbolic language should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.\n\n\"WMCF\" (pp. 378–79) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:\n\nThe cognitive approach to formal systems, as described and implemented in \"WMCF\", need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as Edward Zalta's theory of abstract objects. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, and the history of ideas.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13233189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13233189", "title": "Wisdom of the crowd", "text": "Wisdom of the crowd\n\nThe wisdom of the crowd is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert.\n\nA large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, but often superior to, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group. An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise. This process, while not new to the Information Age, has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as Wikipedia, Yahoo! Answers, Quora, Stack Exchange and other web resources that rely on human opinion.\n\nTrial by jury can be understood as wisdom of the crowd, especially when compared to the alternative, trial by a judge, the single expert. In politics, sometimes sortition is held as an example of what wisdom of the crowd would look like. Decision-making would happen by a diverse group instead of by a fairly homogenous political group or party.\n\nResearch within cognitive science has sought to model the relationship between wisdom of the crowd effects and individual cognition.\n\nIn the context of wisdom of the crowd, the term \"crowd\" takes on a broad meaning. One definition characterizes a crowd as a group of people amassed by an open call for participation. While crowds are often leveraged in online applications, they can also be utilized in offline contexts. In some cases, members of a crowd may be offered monetary incentives for participation. Certain applications of \"wisdom of the crowd\", such as jury duty in the United States, mandate crowd participation.\n\nAristotle is credited as the first person to write about the \"wisdom of the crowd\" in his work titled \"Politics\". According to Aristotle, \"it is possible that the many, though not individually good men, yet when they come together may be better, not individually but collectively, than those who are so, just as public dinners to which many contribute are better than those supplied at one man's cost\".\n\nThe classic wisdom-of-the-crowds finding involves point estimation of a continuous quantity. At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth, 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pounds. This has contributed to the insight in cognitive science that a crowd's individual judgments can be modeled as a probability distribution of responses with the median centered near the true value of the quantity to be estimated.\n\nIn recent years, the \"wisdom of the crowd\" phenomenon has been leveraged in business strategy and advertising spaces. Firms such as Napkin Labs aggregate consumer feedback and brand impressions for clients. Meanwhile, companies such as Trada invoke crowds to design advertisements based on clients' requirements.\n\nNon-human examples are prevalent. For example, the Golden Shiner is a fish that prefers shady areas. The single Shiner has a very difficult time finding shady regions in a body of water whereas a large group is much more efficient at finding the shade.\n\nWisdom-of-the-crowds research routinely attributes the superiority of crowd averages over individual judgments to the elimination of individual noise, an explanation that assumes independence of the individual judgments from each other. Thus the crowd tends to make its best decisions if it is made up of diverse opinions and ideologies.\n\nScott E. Page introduced the diversity prediction theorem: \"The squared error of the collective prediction equals the average squared error minus the predictive diversity\". Therefore, when the diversity in a group is large, the error of the crowd is small.\n\nMiller and Stevyers reduced the independence of individual responses in a wisdom-of-the-crowds experiment by allowing limited communication between participants. Participants were asked to answer ordering questions for general knowledge questions such as the order of U.S. presidents. For half of the questions, each participant started with the ordering submitted by another participant (and alerted to this fact), and for the other half, they started with a random ordering, and in both cases were asked to rearrange them (if necessary) to the correct order. Answers where participants started with another participant's ranking were on average more accurate than those from the random starting condition. Miller and Steyvers conclude that different item-level knowledge among participants is responsible for this phenomenon, and that participants integrated and augmented previous participants' knowledge with their own knowledge.\n\nCrowds tend to work best when there is a correct answer to the question being posed, such as a question about geography or mathematics. When there is not a precise answer crowds can come to arbitrary conclusions.\n\nThe wisdom of the crowd effect is easily undermined. Social influence can cause the average of the crowd answers to be wildly inaccurate, while the geometric mean and the median are far more robust.\n\nExperiments run by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology found that when a group of people were asked to answer a question together they would attempt to come to a consensus which would frequently cause the accuracy of the answer to decrease. i.e. what is the length of a border between two countries? One suggestion to counter this effect is to ensure that the group contains a population with diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe insight that crowd responses to an estimation task can be modeled as a sample from a probability distribution invites comparisons with individual cognition. In particular, it is possible that individual cognition is probabilistic in the sense that individual estimates are drawn from an \"internal probability distribution.\" If this is the case, then two or more estimates of the same quantity from the same person should average to a value closer to ground truth than either of the individual judgments, since the effect of statistical noise within each of these judgments is reduced. This of course rests on the assumption that the noise associated with each judgment is (at least somewhat) statistically independent. Another caveat is that individual probability judgments are often biased toward extreme values (e.g., 0 or 1). Thus any beneficial effect of multiple judgments from the same person is likely to be limited to samples from an unbiased distribution.\n\nVul and Pashler (2008) asked participants for point estimates of continuous quantities associated with general world knowledge, such as \"What percentage of the world's airports are in the United States?\" Without being alerted to the procedure in advance, half of the participants were immediately asked to make a second, different guess in response to the same question, and the other half were asked to do this three weeks later. The average of a participant's two guesses was more accurate than either individual guess. Furthermore, the averages of guesses made in the three-week delay condition were more accurate than guesses made in immediate succession. One explanation of this effect is that guesses in the immediate condition were less independent of each other (an anchoring effect) and were thus subject to (some of) the same kind of noise. In general, these results suggest that individual cognition may indeed be subject to an internal probability distribution characterized by stochastic noise, rather than consistently producing the best answer based on all the knowledge a person has. These results were mostly confirmed in a high-powered pre-registered replication. The only result that was not fully replicated was that a delay in the second guess generates a better estimate.\n\nHourihan and Benjamin (2010) tested the hypothesis that the estimate improvements observed by Vul and Pashler in the delayed responding condition were the result of increased independence of the estimates. To do this Hourihan and Benjamin capitalized on variations in memory span among their participants. In support they found that averaging repeated estimates of those with lower memory spans showed greater estimate improvements than the averaging the repeated estimates of those with larger memory spans.\n\nRauhut and Lorenz (2011) expanded on this research by again asking participants to make estimates of continuous quantities related to real world knowledge – however, in this case participants were informed that they would make five consecutive estimates. This approach allowed the researchers to determine, firstly, the number of times one needs to ask oneself in order to match the accuracy of asking others and then, the rate at which estimates made by oneself improve estimates compared to asking others. The authors concluded that asking oneself an infinite number of times does not surpass the accuracy of asking just one other individual. Overall, they found little support for a so-called “mental distribution” from which individuals draw their estimates; in fact, they found that in some cases asking oneself multiple times actually reduces accuracy. Ultimately, they argue that the results of Vul and Pashler (2008) overestimate the wisdom of the “crowd within” – as their results show that asking oneself more than three times actually reduces accuracy to levels below that reported by Vul and Pashler (who only asked participants to make two estimates).\n\nMüller-Trede (2011) attempted to investigate the types of questions in which utilizing the “crowd within” is most effective. He found that while accuracy gains were smaller than would be expected from averaging ones’ estimates with another individual, repeated judgments lead to increases in accuracy for both year estimation questions (e.g., when was the thermometer invented?) and questions about estimated percentages (e.g., what percentage of internet users connect from China?). General numerical questions (e.g., what is the speed of sound, in kilometers per hour?), however, did not show improvement with repeated judgments, while averaging individual judgments with those of a random other did improve accuracy. This, Müller-Trede argues, is the result of the bounds implied by year and percentage questions.\n\nVan Dolder and Van den Assem (2018) studied the \"crowd within\" using a large database from three estimation competitions organised by Holland Casino. For each of these competitions, they find that within-person aggregation indeed improves accuracy of estimates. Furthermore, they also confirm that this method works better if there is a time delay between subsequent judgments. However, even when there is considerable delay between estimates, the benefit pales against that of between-person aggregation: the average of a large number of judgements from the same person is barely better than the average of two judgements from different people.\n\nHerzog and Hertwig (2009) attempted to improve on the “wisdom of many in one mind” (i.e., the “crowd within”) by asking participants to use dialectical bootstrapping. Dialectical bootstrapping involves the use of dialectic (reasoned discussion that takes place between two or more parties with opposing views, in an attempt to determine the best answer) and bootstrapping (advancing oneself without the assistance of external forces). They posited that people should be able to make greater improvements on their original estimates by basing the second estimate on antithetical information. Therefore, these second estimates, based on different assumptions and knowledge than that used to generate the first estimate would also have a different error (both systematic and random) than the first estimate – increasing the accuracy of the average judgment. From an analytical perspective dialectical bootstrapping should increase accuracy so long as the dialectical estimate is not too far off and the errors of the first and dialectical estimates are different. To test this, Herzog and Hertwig asked participants to make a series of date estimations regarding historical events (e.g., when electricity was discovered), without knowledge that they would be asked to provide a second estimate. Next, half of the participants were simply asked to make a second estimate. The other half were asked to use a consider-the-opposite strategy to make dialectical estimates (using their initial estimates as a reference point). Specifically, participants were asked to imagine that their initial estimate was off, consider what information may have been wrong, what this alternative information would suggest, if that would have made their estimate an overestimate or an underestimate, and finally, based on this perspective what their new estimate would be. Results of this study revealed that while dialectical bootstrapping did not outperform the wisdom of the crowd (averaging each participants’ first estimate with that of a random other participant), it did render better estimates than simply asking individuals to make two estimates.\n\nHirt and Markman (1995) found that participants need not be limited to a consider-the-opposite strategy in order to improve judgments. Researchers asked participants to consider-an-alternative – operationalized as any plausible alternative (rather than simply focusing on the “opposite” alternative) – finding that simply considering an alternative improved judgments.\n\nNot all studies have shown support for the “crowd within” improving judgments. Ariely and colleagues asked participants to provide responses based on their answers to true-false items and their confidence in those answers. They found that while averaging judgment estimates between individuals significantly improved estimates, averaging repeated judgment estimates made by the same individuals did not significantly improve estimates.\n\nAlthough classic wisdom-of-the-crowds findings center on point estimates of single continuous quantities, the phenomenon also scales up to higher-dimensional problems that do not lend themselves to aggregation methods such as taking the mean. More complex models have been developed for these purposes. A few examples of higher-dimensional problems that exhibit wisdom-of-the-crowds effects include:\n\nIn further exploring the ways to improve the results a new technique called the \"surprisingly popular\" was developed by scientists at MIT's Sloan Neuroeconomics Lab in collaboration with Princeton University. For a given question, people are asked to give two responses: What they think the right answer is, and what they think popular opinion will be. The averaged difference between the two indicates the correct answer. It was found that the \"surprisingly popular\" algorithm reduces errors by 21.3 percent in comparison to simple majority votes, and by 24.2 percent in comparison to basic confidence-weighted votes where people express how confident they are of their answers and 22.2 percent compared to advanced confidence-weighted votes, where one only uses the answers with the highest average.\n\n"}
