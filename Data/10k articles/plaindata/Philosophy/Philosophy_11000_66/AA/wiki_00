The organization worked to engage young Jews in discussion and study about the relevance of their heritage. It later expanded worldwide, and continues promotes its extensive adult education classes.\n\nAish HaTorah describes itself as blending the traditions of the Lithuanian yeshivas with the doctrines of Hasidism. Weinberg himself was a product of Lithuanian schools but he was also a grandson of the Slonimer Rebbe. His teachings reflect influences of both schools as well as certain facets of the Kabbalah of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, the Vilna Gaon and others.\n\nAish HaTorah describes itself as pro-Israel and encourages Jewish people to visit Israel and connect to the land and its history. The organization's stated mission is \"providing opportunities for Jews of all backgrounds to discover their heritage.\"\n\nThe name Aish HaTorah, literally \"Fire [of] the Torah\", was inspired by the Talmudic story of Rabbi Akiva, the once illiterate 40-year-old shepherd who subsequently became the most famous sage of the Mishnah. Elie Wiesel said, \"Aish HaTorah means to me the passion of teaching, the passion of learning. The study of Torah, the source of Jewish values, is the way to Jewish survival.\"\n\nAish HaTorah operates about 35 full-time branches on five continents, providing seminars, singles events, executive learning groups, Shabbat and Jewish holiday programs, and community building.\n\nIn Jerusalem, the Aish HaTorah yeshiva offers both beginners' drop-in classes and full-time, intensive study programs for Jewish men and women of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge. It has a high-tech main campus and outreach center that features a rooftop vista overlooking the Temple Mount, and the Kirk Douglas Theatre, which houses a dramatic film presentation of the Jewish contribution to humanity. An \"Explorium\" of Jewish History is scheduled to open in 2013, designed to accommodate 300,000 visitors annually.\n\nAish HaTorah runs the Discovery Seminar. The four-hour seminar reviews Jewish history, Jewish philosophy, and Jewish philosophy questions.\n\nIn 2005 Aish HaTorah produced a documentary film, \"Inspired\" which chronicles the lives of selected baalei teshuvah (\"returnees to Jewish observance\"). Aish HaTorah believes that the high rate of intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews has diluted the Jewish people’s vitality. \"Inspired\" was produced to encourage more observant Jews to share their positive Jewish religious experiences of Jewish life with non-observant Jews, as a way to strengthen the baal teshuva movement and revitalize Jewish life.\n\nIn 2007 Aish released a sequel, \"Inspired Too\". These films paved the way for Project Inspire, the grassroots organization that helps inspire Orthodox Jews to reach out to non-affiliated Jews to teach them about their heritage. Once an offshoot of Aish HaTorah, Project Inspire is now an independent organization under the umbrella of Aish Global.\n\nIn 2008, the Clarion Project, an organization that shares staff, fundraising sources and an address with Aish HaTorah, and has been linked in media reports with Aish HaTorah, distributed its film called \"Obsession.\" The film had been criticized for being unfair in its portrayal of Muslims as violent. The film was sent to more than 28 million people in the United States in anticipation of the United States presidential election. Aish HaTorah denied any connection to the film. The Council on American–Islamic Relations filed a complaint about the film with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn 2012, the Clarion Project released a film called . The film was produced by Raphael Shore, who works for Aish HaTorah. The film was called \"Islamophobic\" by The Forward.\n\nWhen the Israeli Foreign Ministry sought to combat anti-Israel ideas on college campuses, it worked with Aish HaTorah to develop the Hasbara Fellowships. This program has flown hundreds of student leaders to Israel for intensive training in pro-Israel activism training. In North America, Hasbara Fellowships guides and funds pro-Israel activities on over 100 college campuses.\n\nIn August 2016, the Israeli government announced an Israel-Diaspora outreach program called The Israel-Diaspora Initiative. The program partners were announced as Chabad and Olami Worldwide, an organization that works closely with Aish.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1065888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1065888", "title": "Cephalization", "text": "Cephalization\n\nCephalization is an evolutionary trend in which, over many generations, the mouth, sense organs, and nerve ganglia become concentrated at the front end of an animal, producing a head region. This is associated with movement and bilateral symmetry, such that the animal has a definite head end. This led to the formation of a brain in three groups of animals, namely the arthropods, cephalopod molluscs, and vertebrates. Since the molluscs (protostomes) and the vertebrates (deuterostomes) are widely separated on the phylogenetic tree of animals, and have differently organized bodies and brains, cephalization evolved independently in these groups.\n\nCnidaria such as the radially symmetrical Hydrozoa, show some degree of cephalization. The Anthomedusae have a head end with their mouth, photoreceptive cells, and a concentration of neural cells.\n\nCephalization is a characteristic feature of the Bilateria, a large group containing the majority of animal phyla. These have the ability to move, using muscles, and a body plan with a front end that encounters stimuli first as the animal moves forwards, and accordingly has evolved to contain many of the body's sense organs, able to detect light, chemicals, and often sound. There is often also a collection of nerve cells able to process the information from these sense organs, forming a brain in several phyla and one or more ganglia in others.\n\nThe Acoela are basal bilaterians, part of the Xenacoelomorpha. They are small and simple animals, and have very slightly more nerve cells at the head end than elsewhere, not forming a distinct and compact brain. This represents an early stage in cephalization.\n\nThe Platyhelminthes (flatworms) have a more complex nervous system than the Acoela, and are lightly cephalized, for instance having an eyespot above the brain, near the front end.\n\nThe philosopher Michael Trestman noted that three bilaterian phyla, namely the arthropods, the molluscs in the shape of the cephalopods, and the chordates, were distinctive in having \"complex active bodies\", something that the acoels and flatworms did not have. Any such animal, whether predator or prey, has to be aware of its environment—to catch its prey, or to evade its predators. These groups are exactly those that are most highly cephalized. These groups, however, are not closely related: in fact, they represent widely separated branches of the Bilateria, as shown on the phylogenetic tree; their lineages split hundreds of millions of years ago. Other (less cephalized) phyla are not shown, for clarity.\n\nIn arthropods, cephalization progressed with increasing incorporation of trunk segments into the head region. This was advantageous because it allowed for the evolution of more effective mouth-parts for capturing and processing food. Insects are strongly cephalized, their brain made of three fused ganglia attached to the ventral nerve cord, which in turn has a pair of ganglia in each segment of the thorax and abdomen. The insect head is an elaborate structure made of several segments fused rigidly together, and equipped with both simple and compound eyes, and multiple appendages including sensory antennae and complex mouthparts (maxillae and mandibles).\n\nCephalopod molluscs including octopus, squid, cuttlefish and nautilus are the most intelligent and highly cephalized invertebrates, with well-developed senses, including advanced 'camera' eyes and large brains.\n\nCephalization in vertebrates, the group that includes mammals, birds, and fishes, has been studied extensively. The heads of vertebrates are complex structures, with distinct sense organs; a large, multi-lobed brain; jaws, often with teeth; and a tongue. Cephalochordates like \"Branchiostoma\" (the lancelet, a small fishlike animal with very little cephalization), are closely related to vertebrates but do not have these structures. In the 1980s, the new head hypothesis proposed that the vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from the emergence of neural crest and cranial placodes (thickened areas of ectoderm). However, in 2014, a transient larva tissue of the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the neural crest-derived cartilage which forms the vertebrate skull, suggesting that persistence of this tissue and expansion into the entire head space could be a viable evolutionary route to formation of the vertebrate head. Advanced vertebrates have increasingly elaborate brains.\n\n"}

But, as musicologist Ellen Rosand also notes, \"the editing of operatic works from the 17th century, the 18th century and 19th century provides many considerable challenges.\n\nIn an online essay – \"What is a critical edition?: Answers to Questions You Never Thought to Ask\" – which focuses primarily on Rossini, musicologist Patricia Brauner of the Center for Italian Opera Studies at the University of Chicago explains several different aspects of a critical edition, including the process of producing published editions and the ultimate value of them for performers and conductors.\n\nMusicologists such as Gossett and Roger Parker represent parallel approaches to the works of the Italian \"bel canto\" era.

{"id": "2505476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2505476", "title": "Dmitry Merezhkovsky", "text": "Dmitry Merezhkovsky\n\nDmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky (; – December 9, 1941) was a Russian novelist, poet, religious thinker, and literary critic. A seminal figure of the Silver Age of Russian Poetry, regarded as a co-founder of the Symbolist movement, Merezhkovsky – with his poet wife Zinaida Gippius – was twice forced into political exile. During his second exile (1918–1941) he continued publishing successful novels and gained recognition as a critic of the Soviet Union. Known both as a self-styled religious prophet with his own slant on apocalyptic Christianity, and as the author of philosophical historical novels which combined fervent idealism with literary innovation, Merezhkovsky was nine times a nominee for the Nobel Prize in literature, which he came closest to winning in 1933.\n\nDmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky was born on August 2, 1866, in Saint Petersburg, the sixth son in the family. His father Sergey Ivanovich Merezhkovsky served as a senior official in several Russian local governors' cabinets (including that of I.D.Talyzin in Orenburg) before entering Alexander II's court office as a Privy Councillor. His mother Varvara Vasilyevna Merezhkovskaya (née Tcherkasova) was a daughter of a senior Saint Petersburg security official. Fond of arts and literature, she was what Dmitry Merezhkovsky later remembered as the guiding light of his rather lonely childhood (despite the presence of five brothers and three sisters around). There were only three people Merezhkovsky had any affinity with in his whole lifetime, and his mother, a woman \"of rare beauty and angelic nature\" according to biographer Yuri Zobnin, was the first and the most important of them.\n\nDmitry Merezhkovsky spent his early years on the Yelagin Island in Saint Petersburg, in a palace-like cottage which served as a summer dacha for the family. In the city the family occupied an old house facing the Summer Gardens, near Prachechny Bridge. The Merezhkovskys also owned a large estate in Crimea, by a road leading to the Uchan-Su waterfall. \"Fabulous Oreanda palace, now in ruins, will stay with me forever. White marble pylons against the blue sea... for me it's a timeless symbol of Ancient Greece,\" he wrote years later. Sergey Merezhkovsky, although a man of means, led an ascetic life, keeping his household 'lean and thrifty'. He saw this also as 'moral prophylactics' for his children, regarding luxury-seeking and reckless spending as the two deadliest sins. The parents traveled a lot, and an old German housekeeper Amalia Khristianovna spent much time with the children, amusing them with Russian fairytales and Biblical stories. It was her recounting of saints' lives that helped Dmitry to develop fervent religious feelings in his early teens.\n\nIn 1876 Dmitry Merezhkovsky joined an elite grammar school, the St. Petersburg Third Classic Gymnasium. Years spent there he described later by one word, \"murderous\", remembering just one teacher as a decent person – \"Kessler the Latinist; well-meaning he surely never was, but at least had a kindly look.\" At thirteen Dmitry started writing poetry, rather in the vein of Pushkin's \"Bakhchisarai Fountain\" as he later remembered. He became fascinated with the works of Molière to such an extent as to form a Molière Circle in the Gymnasium. The group had nothing political on its agenda, but still made the secret police interested. All of its members were summoned one by one to the Third Department's headquarters by the Politzeisky Bridge to be questioned. It is believed that only Sergey Merezhkovsky's efforts prevented his son from being expelled from the school.\n\nMuch as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced father, later he had to give him credit for being the first one to have noticed and, in his emotionless way, appreciate his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in Alupka, Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) \"spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul\" and encouraged him to soldier on. Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: \"Poor, very poor. To write well, one has to suffer. Suffer!\" – \"Oh no, I'd rather he won't – either suffer, or write well!\", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict. Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine \"Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye\" published two of his poems, \"Little Cloud\" and \"The Autumn Melody\". A year later another poem \"Narcissus\" was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by Pyotr Yakubovich.\n\nIn Autumn 1882 Merezhkovsky attended one of the first of Semyon Nadson's public readings and, deeply impressed, wrote him a letter. Soon Nadson became Merezhkovsky's closest friend – in fact, the only one, apart from his mother. Later researchers suggested there was some mystery shared by the two young men, something to do with \"fatal illness, fear of death and longing for faith as an antidote to such fear.\" Nadson died in 1887, Varvara Vasilyevna two years later; feeling that he's lost everything he'd ever had in this world, Merezhkovsky submerged into deep depression.\n\nIn January 1883 \"Otechestvennye Zapiski\" published two more of Merezhkovsky's poems. \"Sakya Muni\", the best known of his earlier works, entered popular poetry recital compilations of the time and made the author almost famous. By 1896 Merezhkovsky was rated as \"a well known poet\" by the \"Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary\". Years later, having gained fame as a novelist, he felt embarrassed by his poetry and, while compiling his first \"Complete\" series in the late 1900s, cut the poetry section down to several pieces. Nevertheless, Merezhkovsky's poems remained popular, and some major Russian composers, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky among them, have set dozens of them to music.\n\nIn 1884–1889 Merezhkovsky studied history and philology at the University of Saint Petersburg where his PhD was on Montaigne. He learned several foreign languages and developed strong interest in the French literature, the philosophy of positivism, theories of John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. Still, his student years were joyless. \"University gave me no more than a Gymnasium did. I've never had proper – either family, or education,\" he wrote in his 1913 autobiography. The only lecturer he remembered fondly was the historian of literature Orest Miller, who held a domestic literature circle.\n\nIn 1884 Merezhkovsky (along with Nadson) joined the Saint Petersburg's Literary Society, on Aleksey Pleshcheyev's recommendation. The latter introduced the young poet to the family of Karl Davydov, head of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His wife Anna Arkadyevna became Merezhkovsky's publisher in the 1890s, their daughter Julia – his first (strong, even if fleeting) romantic interest. In Davydov's circle Merezhkovsky mixed with well-established literary figures of the time – Ivan Goncharov, Apollon Maykov, Yakov Polonsky, but also Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Gleb Uspensky, two prominent narodniks whom he regarded later as his first real teachers.\n\nIt was under the guidance of the latter that Merezhkovsky, while still a University student, embarked upon an extensive journey through the Russian provinces where he met lots of people, notably religious cults leaders. He stayed for some time in Chudovo village where Uspensky lived, and both men spent many sleepless nights discussing things like \"life's religious meaning,\" \"a common man's cosmic vision\" and \"the power of the land.\" At the time he was seriously considering leaving the capital to settle down in some far-out country place and become a teacher.\n\nAnother big influence was Mikhaylovsky, who introduced the young man to the staff of \"Severny Vestnik\", a literary magazine he founded with Davydova. Here Merezhkovsky met Vladimir Korolenko and Vsevolod Garshin, and later Nikolai Minsky, Konstantin Balmont and Fyodor Sologub: the future leaders of the Russian Symbolism movement. Merezhkovsky's first article for the magazine, \"A Peasant in the French literature\", upset his mentor: Mikhaylovsky spotted in his young protégé the \"penchant for mysticism,\" something he himself was averse to.\n\nIn the early 1888 Merezhkovsky graduated from the University and embarked upon a tour through the South of Russia, starting in Odessa. In Borjomi he met 19-year-old poet Zinaida Gippius. The two fell in love and on January 18, 1889, married in Tiflis, making arguably the most prolific and influential couple in the history of Russian literature. Soon husband and wife moved into their new Saint Petersburg house, Merezkovsky's mother's wedding present.\n\nMerezhkovsky's major literary debut came with the publication of \"Poems (1883–1888)\". It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but – even coupled with \"Protopop Avvacum\", a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.\n\nHaving by this time lost interest in poetry, Dmitry Merezhkovsky developed a strong affinity to Greek drama and published translations of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides in \"Vestnik Evropy\". These and some of his later translations from Ancient Greek (like prosaic version of \"Daphnis and Chloe\", 1896), almost unnoticed by the contemporary critics, later came to be regarded (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) \"the pride of the Russian school of classical translation.\"\n\nIn the late 1880s Merezhkovsky debuted as a literary critic with an essay on Anton Chekhov entitled \"A Newly-born Talent Facing the Same Old Question\" and published by \"Severny Vestnik\". Having spotted in his subject's prose \"the seeds of irrational, alternative truth,\" Merezhkovsky inadvertently put an end to his friendship with Mikhaylovsky and amused Chekhov who, in his letter to Pleshcheev, mentioned the \"disturbing lack of simplicity\" as the article's major fault. Merezhkovsky continued in the same vein and thus invented (in retrospect) the whole new genre of a philosophical essay as a form of critical thesis, something unheard of in Russian literature before. Merezhkovsky's biographical pieces on Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Goncharov, Maykov, Korolenko, Pliny, Calderon scandalized the contemporary literary establishment. Later, compiled in a volume called \"The Eternal Companions\", these essays were pronounced modern classics, their author praised as \"the subtlest and the deepest of late XIX – early XX Russian literary critics\" by literary historian Arkady Dolinin. \"The Eternal Companions\" became so revered a piece of literary art in the early 1910s that the volume was officially chosen as an honorary gift for excelling grammar school graduates.\nIn May 1890 Liubov Gurevich, the new head of the revamped \"Severny Vestnik\", turned a former narodnik's safe haven into the exciting club for members of the rising experimental literature scene, labeled \"decadent\" by detractors. Merezhkovsky's new drama \"Sylvio\" was published there, the translation of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\" followed suit. Other journals became interested in the young author too: \"Russkaya Mysl\" published his poem \"Vera\" (later included in his \"The Symbols\" compilation), hailed as one of the Russian Symbolism's early masterpieces, its colourful mysticism providing a healthy antidote to narodniks's \"reflections\" of the social life. Bryusov \"absolutely fell in love with it,\" and Pyotr Pertsov years later admitted: \"For my young mind Merezhkovsky's \"Vera\" sounded so much superior to this dull and old-fashioned Pushkin\".\n\n\"Russkaya Mysl\" released \"The Family Idyll\" (Semeynaya idillia, 1890), a year later another symbolic poem \"Death\" (Smert) appeared in \"Severny Vestnik\". In 1891 Merezhkovsky and Gippius made their first journey to Europe, staying mostly in Italy and France; the poem \"End of the Century\" (Konetz Veka) inspired by the European trip, came out two years later. On their return home the couple stayed for a while in Guppius' dacha at Vyshny Volochyok; it was here that Merezhkovsky started working on his first novel, \"The Death of the Gods. Julian the Apostate\". A year later it was finished, but by this time the situation with \"Severny Vestnik\" has changed: outraged by Akim Volynsky's intrusive editorial methods, Merezhkovsky severed ties with the magazine, at least for a while. In the late 1891 he published his translation of Sophocles' \"Antigona\" in \"Vestnik Evropy\", part of Goethe's \"Faustus\" (in \"Russkoye Obozrenye\") and Euripides' \"Hyppolite\" (in \"Vestnik Evropy\" again). The latter came out in 1893, after the couple's second trip to Europe where their first encounter with Dmitry Filosofov occurred. Merezhkovsky's vivid impressions of Greece and the subsequent spurt of the new ideas provided the foundation for his second novel.\n\nIn 1892 Merezhkovsky's second volume of poetry entitled \"Symbols. Poems and Songs\" came out. The book, bearing E.A.Poe and Charles Baudelaire's influences but also tinged with the author's newly found religious ideas, became a younger readership's favourite. Of the elder writers only Yakov Polonsky supported it wholeheartedly. In October 1892 Merezhkovsky's lecture \"The Causes of the Decline of the Contemporary Russian Literature and the New Trends in it\" was first read in public, then came out in print. Brushing aside the 'decadent' tag, the author argued that all three \"streaks of Modern art\" — \"Mystic essence, Symbolic language and Impressionism\" — could be traced down to the works of Lev Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky, Russian Modernism, therefore, being a continuation of the Russian literature's classic tradition. Coupled with \"Symbols\", the lecture was widely accepted as Russian symbolism's early manifest. The general reaction to it was mostly negative. The author found himself between the two fires: liberals condemned his ideas as \"the new obscurantism,\" members of posh literary salons treated his revelations with scorn. Only one small group of people greeted \"The Causes\" unanimously, and that was the staff of \"Severny Vestnik\", which welcomed him back.\n\nIn 1893–1894 Merezhkovsky published numerous books (the play \"The Storm is Over\" and the translation of Sophocles' \"Oedipus the King\" among them), but the money all this hard work brought were scant. Now writing his second novel, he had to accept whatever work was offered to him. In the late 1893 Merezhkovskys settled in Saint Petersburg again. Here they frequented the Shakespearean Circle, the Polonsky's Fridays and the Literary Fund gatherings. Then the pair started their own home salon with Filosofov and Akim Volynsky becoming habitués. All of a sudden Merezhkovsky found that his debut novel was to be published in \"Severny Vestnik\" after all. What he didn't realise was that this came as a result of a Gippius' tumultuous secret love affair with Akim Volynsky, one of this magazine's chiefs.\n\n\"The Death of the Gods\" which came out in 1895 (\"Severny Vestnik\", Nos.1–6) opened the \"Christ & Antichrist\" trilogy and in retrospect is regarded as the first Russian symbolist novel. Sceptics prevailed (most of them denouncing the author's alleged Nietzscheanity), but the allies were ecstatic. \"A novel made for eternity,\" Bryusov marveled. Five years later \"Julian the Apostate\" was published in France, translated by Zinaida Vasilyeva.\n\nMerezhkovsky's relationship with \"Severny Vestnik\", though, again started to deteriorate, the reason being Akim Volynsky's jealousy. In 1896 all three of them (husband still unaware of what was going on behind his back) made a trip to Europe to visit Leonardo da Vinci's places. Several ugly rows with Volynsky finally prompted Gippius to send her scandalous-minded lover home. Volynsky reacted by expelling his ex-lover's husband from \"Severny Vestnik\" (some sources say it was the Merezhkovskys who withdraw their cooperation with the \"Severny Vestnik\" a year before the magazine shut down in 1898, along with Minsky and Sologub), made sure the major literary journals would shut the door on him and published (in 1900) under his own name a monograph \"Leonardo da Vinci\", written and compiled by his adversary.\n\nThe scandal concerning plagiarism lasted for almost two years. Feeling sick and ignored, Merezhkovsky in 1897 was seriously considering leaving his country for good, being kept at home only by the lack of money. For almost three years the second novel, \"Resurrection of Gods. Leonardo da Vinci\" (\"The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci\" – in English and French) remained unpublished. It finally appeared in Autumn 1900 in \"Mir Bozhy\" under the title \"The Renaissance\". In retrospect these two books' \"...persuasive power came from Merezhkovsky's success in catching currents then around him: strong contrasts between social life and spiritual values, fresh interest in the drama of pagan ancient Athens, and identification with general western European culture.\"\n\nBy the time of his second novel's release Merezhkovsky was in a different cultural camp – that of Dyagilev and his close friends – Alexandre Benois, Leon Bakst, Nikolay Minsky and Valentin Serov. Their own brand new \"Mir Iskusstva\" (World of Art) magazine, with Dmitry Filosofov as a literary editor, accepted Merezhkovsky wholeheartedly. It was here that his most famous essay, \"L. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky\" was published in 1900–1901, coinciding with the escalation of Tolstoy's conflict with the Russian Orthodox church. Tolstoy invited the couple to his Yasnaya Polyana estate in 1904 and, to both parties' delight, the visit proved to be friendly. Behind the facade, there was little love lost between them; the old man confessed in his diary that, he just couldn't \"force himself to love those two,\" and Merezhkovsky's critique of what he saw as \"Tolstoy's nihilism\" continued.\n\nIn the early 1900s Merezhkovskys formed the group called the Religious-Philosophical Meetings (1901–1903) based on the concept of the New Church which was suggested by Gippius and supposed to become an alternative to the old Orthodox doctrine, \"...imperfect and prone to stagnation.\" The group, organized by Merezhkovsky and Gippius along with Vasily Rozanov, Viktor Mirolyubov and Valentin Ternavtsev, claimed to provide \"a tribune for open discussion of questions concerning religious and cultural problems,\" serving to promote \"neo-Christianity, social organization and whatever serves perfecting the human nature.\" Having lost by this time contacts with both \"Mir Iskusstva\" and \"Mir Bozhy\", Merezhkovskys felt it was time for them to create their own magazine, as a means for \"bringing the thinking religious community together.\" In July 1902, in association with Pyotr Pertsov and assisted by some senior officials including ministers Dmitry Sipyagin and Vyacheslav von Plehve, they opened their own \"Novy Put\" (New Path) magazine, designed as an outlet for The Meetings.\n\nAfter the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of the group (by this time known as \"Bogoiskateli\", or God-seekers) were cancelled by the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Konstantin Pobedonostsev's decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass sectarian settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular. In \"Novy Put\" things changed too: with the arrival of strong personalities like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov and Semyon Frank the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit \"Novy Put\", remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas. This time it looked more like a literary circle than anything it had ever purported to be.\n\nThe couple formed their own domestic \"church\", trying to involve \"miriskusniks\". Of the latter, only Filosofov took the idea seriously and became the third member of the so-called \"Troyebratstvo\" (The Brotherhood of Three) built loosely upon the Holy Trinity format and having to do with the obscure 12th century idea of the Third Testament. Merezhkovsky developed it into the \"Church of the Holy Ghost\", destined to succeed older churches – first of the Father (Old Testament), then of the Son (New Testament). The services at \"Troyebratstvo\" (with the traditional Russian Orthodox elements organized into a bizarre set of rituals) were seen by many as blasphemy and divided the St. Petersburg intellectual elite: Vasily Rozanov was fascinated by the thinly veiled eroticism of the happening, Nikolai Berdyaev was among those outraged by the whole thing, as were the (gay, mostly) members of \"Mir Iskusstva\". Sergei Diaghilev accused Filosofov of committing 'adultery'. The latter in 1905 settled down in Merezhkovskys' St. Petersburg house, becoming virtually a family member.\n\nIn 1904 \"Peter and Alexis\", the third and final novel of \"Christ and Antichrist\" trilogy was published (in \"Novy Put\", Nos.1–5, 9–12), having at its focus the figure of Peter the Great as an \"embodied Antichrist\" – an idea the author shared with Russian \"raskolniki\". The novel's release was now eagerly anticipated in Europe where Merezhkovsky by this time has become a best-selling author, \"Julian the Apostate\" having undergone ten editions (in four years) in France. But when the \"Daily Telegraph\" described the novelist as \"a heir to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky's legacy,\" back in Russia critics denounced this praise so unanimously that Merezhkovsky was forced to publicly deny having had any pretensions of this kind whatsoever.\n\nAfter the Bloody Sunday of January 9, 1905, Merezhkovsky's views changed drastically, the defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy by the Imperial Japanese Navy helping him see, as he put it, \"the anti-Christian nature of the Russian monarchy.\" The 1905 Revolution was now seen by Merezhkovsky as a prelude for some kind of a religious upheaval he thought himself to be a prophet of. The writer became an ardent supporter of the civil unrest, writing pro-revolutionary verse, organizing protest parties for students, like that in Alexandrinsky theatre. In October 1905 he greeted the government's 'freedoms-granting' decree but since then was only strengthening ties with leftist radicals, notably, esers.\n\nIn \"The Forthcoming Ham \" (Gryadushchu Ham, 1905) Merezhkovsky explained his political stance, seeing, as usual, all things refracted into Trinities. Using the pun (\"Ham\" in Russian, along with a Biblical character's name, meaning 'lout', 'boor') the author described the three \"faces of Ham'stvo\" (son of Noah's new incarnation as kind of nasty, God-jeering scoundrel Russian): the past (Russian Orthodox Church's hypocrisy), the present (the state bureaucracy and monarchy) and the future – massive \"boorish upstart rising up from society's bottom.\" Several years on the book was regarded as prophetic by many.\n\nIn spring 1906, Merezhkovsky and Filosofov went into a self-imposed European exile in order to promote what they termed \"the new religious consciousness.\" In France they founded \"Anarchy and Theocracy\" magazine and released a compilation of essays called \"Le Tsar et la Revolution\". In one of the articles he contributed to it, \"Revolution and Religion\", Merezhkovsky wrote: \"Now it's almost impossible to foresee what a deadly force this revolutionary tornado starting upwards from the society's bottom will turn out to be. The church will be crashed down and the monarchy too, but with them — what if Russia itself is to perish — if not the timeless soul of it, then its body, the state?\" Again, what at the time was looked upon as dull political grotesque a decade later turned into grim reality.\n\nIn 1908 the play about \"the routinous side of the revolution,\" \"Poppy Blossom\" (Makov Tzvet) came out, all three Troyebratstvo members credited as co-authors. It was followed by \"The Last Saint\" (Posledny Svyatoy), a study on Seraphim Sarovsky, this time Merezhkovsky's own work. More significant were two of his socio-political/philosophical essays, \"Not Peace But Sword\" and \"In Sill Waters\". In them, working upon his concept of \"the evolutionary mysticism,\" Merezhkovsky argued that revolution in both Russia and the rest of the world (he saw the two as closely linked: the first \"steaming forward,\" the latter \"rattling behind\") was inevitable, but could succeed only if preceded by \"the revolution of the human spirit,\" involving the Russian intelligentsia's embracing his idea of the Third Testament. Otherwise, Merezhkovsky prophesied, political revolution will bring nothing but tyranny and the \"Kingdom of Ham.\"\n\nAmong people whom Merezhkovskys talked with in Paris were Anatole France, Rudolf Steiner, Bergson, leaders of the French Socialists. Disappointed by the general polite indifference to their ideas, husband and wife returned home in the late 1908, but not before Merezhkovsky's historical drama \"Pavel the First\" (Pavel Pervy) was published. Confiscated and then banned by the Russian authorities, it became the first part of the trilogy \"The Kingdom of the Beast\" (Tsarstvo zverya). Dealing with the nature and history of the Russian monarchy, the trilogy had little in common with the author's earlier symbolism-influenced prose and, cast in the humanist tradition of the 19th-century Russian literature, was seen later as marking the peak of Merezhkovsky's literary career. The second and the third parts of the trilogy, the Decembrists novels \"Alexander the First\" and \"December 14\" came out in 1913 and 1918 respectively.\n\nIn 1909 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of another controversy after coming out with harsh criticism of \"Vekhi\", the volume of political and philosophical essays written and compiled by the group of influential writers, mostly his former friends and allies, who promoted their work as a manifesto, aiming to incite the inert Russian intelligentsia into the spiritual revival. Arguing against \"vekhovtsy\"s idea of bringing Orthodoxy and the Russian intellectual elite together, Merezhkovsky wrote in an open letter to Nikolay Berdyaev:Orthodoxy is the very soul of the Russian monarchy, and monarchy is the Orthodoxy's carcass. Among things they both hold sacred are political repressions, the [ultra-nationalist] Union of Russian People, the death penalty and meddling with other countries' international affairs. How can one entrust oneself to prayers of those whose actions one sees as God-less and demonic?\n\nSome argued Merezhkovsky's stance was inconsistent with his own ideas of some five years ago. After all, the \"Vekhi\" authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the times have changed for Merezhkovsky and – following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful) anti-\"Vekhi\" tirade, his social status, too. Shied by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: Saratov Bishop Dolganov even demanded his excommunication after the book \"Sick Russia \" was published in 1910. For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a \"decadent pariah\" any-more, suddenly turned a \"well-established Russian novelist\" and the \"pride of the European literature.\" Time has come for former friend Rozanov to write words that proved in the long run to be prophetic: \"The thing is, Dmitry Sergeyevich, those whom you are with now, will never be with you. Never will you find it in yourself to wholly embrace this dumb, dull and horrible snout of the Russian revolution.\"\n\nIn the early 1910s Merezhkovsky moved to the left side of the Russian cultural spectrum, finding among his closest associates the esers Ilya Fondaminsky and, notably, Boris Savinkov. The latter was trying to receive from Merezhkovsky some religious and philosophical justification for his own terrorist ideology, but also had another, more down to Earth axe to grind, that of getting his first novel published. This he did, with Merezhkovsky's assistance – to strike the most unusual debut of the 1910 Russian literary season. In 1911 Merezhkovsky was officially accused of having links with terrorists. Pending trial (which included the case of \"Pavel Pervy\" play) the writer stayed in Europe, then crossed the border in 1912 only to have several chapters of \"Alexander the First\" novel confiscated. He avoided being arrested and in September, along with Pirozhkov, the publisher, was acquitted.\n\n1913 saw Merezhkovsky involved in another public scandal, when Vasily Rozanov openly accused him of having ties with the \"terrorist underground\" and, as he put it, \"trying to sell Motherland to Jews.\" Merezhkovsky suggested that the Religious and Philosophical Society should hold a trial and expel Rozanov from its ranks. The move turned to be miscalculated, the writer failing to take into account the extent of his own unpopularity within the Society. The majority of the latter declined the proposal. Rozanov, high-horsed, quit the Society on his own accord to respond stingingly by publishing Merezhkovsky's private letters so as to demonstrate the latter's hypocrisy on the matter.\n\nFor a while 1914 looked like it was going to be the first ever relatively calm year for Merezhkovsky. With the two \"Complete Works Of\" editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic Nestor Kotlyarevsky nominated the author for the Nobel Prize for literature. Then World War I broke out. Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer made a conscious effort to distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with Alexander Kerensky and joining the Maxim Gorky-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the painless possible way.\n\nA couple of new Merezhkovsky's plays, \"Joy Will Come\" (Radost Budet) and \"The Romantics\" were staged in war-time Petrograd theaters. The latter was successful, hit, but for the mainstream critics its author remained a \"controversial author.\" \"All in all, the Russian literature is as hostile to me as it had always been. I could as well be celebrating the 25th anniversary of this hostility,\" the author wrote in his short autobiography for Semyon Vengerov's biographical dictionary.\n\n1917 for Merezhkovskys started with a bout of political activity: the couple's flat on Sergiyevskaya Street looked like a secret branch of Russian Duma (that was when the seeds of a rumour concerning the couple's alleged membership in the Russian freemason community were sown). Merezhkovsky greeted the February anti-monarchy revolution and described the Kerensky-led Provisional government as \"quite friendly.\" By the end of the spring he had become disillusioned with the government and its ineffective leader; in summer he began to speak of the government's inevitable fall and the Bolshevik's tyranny coming. The late October saw Merezhkovsky's worst expectations coming to life.\n\nFor Merezhkovsky the October Socialist revolution was a catastrophe. He saw it as the Coming of Ham he wrote about a decade later, the tragic victory for, as he choose to put it, Narod-Zver (The Beast-nation), the political and social incarnation of the universal Evil, putting the whole human civilization to danger. Merezhkovsky and Gippius tried to use whatever influence they retained upon the Bolshevist cultural leaders to ensure the release of their friends, the arrested Provisional government ministers. Ironically, one of the first thing the Soviet government did was lift the ban from anti-monarchist \"Pavel Pervy\" play and it was staged in several Red Russia's theaters.\n\nFor a while Merezhkovskys's flat served as an esers' headquarters but this came to an end in January 1918 when the so-called \"Uchredilovka\" was dissolved by Vladimir Lenin. In his 1918 diary Merezhkovsky wrote:\n\nIn 1919, having sold everything including dishes and extra clothes, Merezhkovskys started collaborating with Maxim Gorky's new World Literature publishing house, receiving salary and food rations. \"Russian Communists are not all of them villains. There are well-meaning, honest, crystal clear people among them. Saints, almost. These are the most horrible ones. These saints stink of the 'Chinese meat' most,\" Merezhkovsky wrote in his diary.\n\nAfter news started to filter through of Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin's consequent defeats, Merezhkovskys saw their only chance of survival in fleeing Russia. This they did on December 14, 1919, along with Filosofov and Zlobin (Gippius' young secretary), having obtained Anatoly Lunacharsky-signed permission \"to leave Petrograd for the purpose of reading some lectures on Ancient Egypt to Red Army fighters.\"\n\nMerezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed first for Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give newspaper interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:The whole question of Russia's existence as such — and it's non-existent at the moment, as far as I am concerned, — depends on Europe's recognizing at last the true nature of Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [proclaimed] dictatorship of proletariat; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: Lenin and Trotsky.\n\nIn Warsaw Merezhkovsky did practical work for some Russian immigrant organizations, Gippius edited the literary section in \"Svoboda\" newspaper. Both were regarding Poland as a \"messianic\", potentially unifying place and a crucial barrier in the face of the spreading Bolshevism plague. In the summer of 1920 Boris Savinkov arrived into the country to have talks with Jozef Pilsudski: he engaged Merezhkovsky and Filosofov in the activities of the so-called Russian Evacuation committee (more of a White Army mobilization center) and introduced the writer to the Polish President. On behalf of the Committee Merezhkovsky issued a memorandum calling the peoples of Russia to stop fighting the Polish army and join its ranks. The whole thing flopped, though, as Poland and Russia reached the armistice agreement. Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France, Filosofov staying in Warsaw to head the Savinkov-led Russian National committee's anti-Bolshevik propaganda department.\n\nIn Paris Merezhkovsky founded the Religious Union (later Soyuz Neprimirimykh, the Union of the Unpacified), was holding lectures, contributed to Pavel Milyukov's \"Poslednye Novosty\" and Pyotr Struve's \"Osvobozhdenye\" newspapers, exposing what he saw as the Bolshevist lies and denouncing the \"Kingdom of Antichrist.\" It was becoming more and more obvious, though, that Merezhkovsky, backed only by the circle of friends, was in isolation, misunderstood by some, abhorred by others. His calling for the international intervention into Russia angered the left; rejecting the restoration of the Russian monarchy antagonized the right. His single ally at the time was Ivan Bunin; never sharing much personal affinity, the two men formed an alliance in their relentless anti-Soviet campaign. Besides, having maintained strong contacts with influential French politics lobbying the interests of the Russian immigrants, both ensured that the Russian writers should get some financial support from the French government. A couple of years later another sponsor was found in Tomas Masaryk who granted personal pensions to some prominent figures in the immigrant Russian writers' community.\n\nMerezhkovsky insisted upon severing all the International PEN's contacts with Communist Russia and cancelling French help for the victims of mass hunger in Russian Volga Region arguing, not unreasonably, that those in need won't ever see any of the money or food sent. He criticised the exiled Russian Constituent Assembly's communique which was, in his opinion, too conciliatory in tone. In 1922 the collection of articles and essays of the four authors (Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov contacts with whom have been restored, and Zlobin) came out under the title \"The Kingdom of Antichrist\", the general idea of the book being that the 'Russian fires', globalist in their nature and intent, promise \"either brotherhood in slavery or the end in a common grave\" for the European nations.\n\nIn winter 1925 a small literary and philosophy circle was formed by Merezhkovsky and Gippius; two years later it was officially launched as the Green Lamp group. With the \"Novy Korabl\" (The New Ship) magazine of its own, the group attracted the whole of the Russian intellectual elite in exile and was remaining the important cultural center for the next ten years. \"We are the Criticism of Russia as such, the latter's disembodied Thought and Conscience, free to judge its present and foresee its future,\" wrote Merezhkovsky of the Green Lamp mission.\n\nIn 1928 at the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in Belgrade, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia bestowed Merezhkovsky with the Order of Savva of the 1st Degree meriting his services for world culture. A series of lectures organised for Merezhkovsky and Gippius by the Serbian Academy signalled the launch of the Yugoslav-based \"Russian Library\" series, where the best works of Bunin, Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Alexander Kuprin, Aleksey Remizov, Konstantin Balmont, Ivan Shmelyov and Igor Severyanin came out over the next several years. Things started to deteriorare in the early 1930s; with the Czech and the French grants withdrawn and much feared Socialists rising high on the French political scene, Merezhkovskys looked southwards and found there a sympathizer in Benito Mussolini who took great interest in the work and views of a Russian writer, now a multiple Nobel Prize for literature nominee.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, disappointed by the Western cultural elite's reaction to his political manifestos, Merezhkovsky returned to religious and philosophical essays, but in the new format, that of a monumental free-form experimental-styled treatise. Some of his new books were biographies, some just extensive, amorphous researches in ancient history. Speaking of the first two of them, \"The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete\" (1925) and \"Messiah\" (1928), Merezhkovsky thus explained his credo: \"Many people think I am a historical novelist, which is wrong. What I use the Past for is only searching for the Future. The Present is a kind of exile to me. My true home is the Past/Future, which is where I belong.\"\n\nOf the three fundamental books Merezhkovsky created in the late 1920s early 1930s another trilogy took shape, loosely linked by the concept of man's possible way to salvation. \"The Mystery of the Three: Egypt and Babylon\" (Prague, 1925) was followed by the \"Mystery of the West: Atlantis-Europe\" (Berlin, 1930), where the cherished Third Testament idea took an apocalyptic, Nietzschean turn. The third, \"Unfamiliar Jesus\" (1932, Belgrade), is seen in retrospect as the strongest of the three.\n\nAll of a sudden Merezhkovsky, a prolific writer again, drifted into the focus of the Nobel Prize committee attention. From 1930 onwards Sigurd Agrell, professor of Slavic languages in Lund University, started to methodically nominate Merezhkovsky for the Prize, although, invariably (and rather frustratingly for both), in tandem with Ivan Bunin. In November 1932 Gippius in a letter to Vera Bunina expressed her opinion that Merezhkovsky had no chance of winning \"because of his anti-Communist stance,\" but the truth was, Bunin (no lesser a Communism-loather than his rival) wrote books that were more accessible and, generally, popular. Merezkovsky even suggested they should make a pact and divide the money should one of them ever win, but Bunin took seriously what was meant apparently as a joke and responded with outright refusal. He won the Prize in 1933.\n\nAgrell continued nominating Merezhkovsky up until his own death in 1937 (making eight such nominations, in all), but each year the latter's chances were getting slimmer. The books he produced in his latter years (like the compilation of religious biographies \"Faces of Saints: from Jesus to Nowadays\" and \"The Reformers\" trilogy, published posthumously) weren't ground-breaking. Hard times and deepening troubles notwithstanding, Merezhkovsky continued to work hard until his dying day, trying desperately to complete his \"Spanish Mysteries\" trilogy; the last of the three pieces, the unfinished \"Little Theresa\", was with him at his deathbed; he died literally with a pen in his hand.\n\nAlthough never a nationalist, Merezhkovsky was a Russo-centric author and thinker, cherishing the idea of his country's unique and in many ways decisive place in the world culture in history. Never tiring of reiterating the \"Russian plight is the problem of the world, not Russia\" postulate, he was ever on the look-out for some 'strong leader' who would be able to organize and successfully see through the anti-Communist crusade. For a while Merezhkovsky thought he had found his hero in Benito Mussolini who, having sponsored his book on Dante, had several lengthy talks with the Russian writer on politics, literature and art. Impressed, Merezhkovsky started to see his new friend almost as an incarnation of Dante. In a letter addressed to Mussolini, he wrote:The best, the truest and the liveliest document on Dante is — your personality. To understand Dante one has to live through him, but only you being around makes that possible. Two souls, his and yours, are merged into one, Infinity itself bringing you two together. Visualize Mussolini in contemplation, and it's Dante. Imagine Dante in action, and it's Mussolini.\n\nAll the while Merezhkovsky was trying to convince Mussolini that it was the latter's mission to start the \"Holy War against Russia\" (the idea formed the basis of his article \"Meeting Mussolini\", published by \"Illustrated Russia\" in February 1937). Seeing his name frequently mentioned by the Italian press in connection with bizarre Merezhkovsky's suggestions made duce uneasy and he took a step back. Visiting Rome in summer 1937, Merezhkovsky had talks with the Italian Foreign minister, but failed to meet Mussolini. Then came the disillusionment, and in October of the same year he was already speaking of how disappointed he was with the Italian leader's \"petty materialism.\" He tried to contact General Francisco Franco, now seeing Spain as the last anti-Communist citadel of Europe and failed. Thus Merezhkovsky's choice of the new European \"heroes\" narrowed down to Adolf Hitler.\n\nMerezhkovsky had never seen Fascism as an alternative to Communism. As early as 1930 he wrote of doomed Europe stuck between the two \"stores of explosives: Fascism and Communism,\" expressing hope that some day these two evils will somehow destroy one another. But the danger of Fuhrer's possible taking over Europe was still the lesser evil for him than the possible Communist expansion. The \"Hitler dilemma\" was the only thing husband and wife have ever disagreed on. Gippius hated and despised Fuhrer, referring to him as \"an idiot\". Merezhkovsky thought he found a leader who'd be able to take the whole of Antichrist Kingdom upon himself, this outweighing for him such trivia as the fact that his own \"Joan of Arc\" (1939) was banned in Germany on the day of its release.\n\nIn summer 1939 Paramount (in collaboration with the French Association des Auteurs de Films) bought Merezhkovsky's scenario \"The Life of Dante\". The production was cancelled on September 1, as World War II broke out in Europe. On September 9, fleeing the air raids, the Merezhkovskys moved to Biarritz in the South of the country where they spent the next three months, communicating mainly with the French and the English military officers, but also with Irina Odoyevtseva and her husband Georgy Ivanov.\n\nOn June 27 Biarritz got occupied. Here in a hotel on August 14 the writer's 75th anniversary celebration was held, organized by a group of French writers, with some notable Russians like Pavel Milyukov, Ivan Bunin and Mark Aldanov invited. It was there that Merezhkovsky made comments which (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) were later presented by some memoirists as his \"infamous German radio speech\". Still, even Zobnin admits that there were reasons to regard him a Nazi sympathizer. In the Autumn of 1941 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of his German admirers – students, mostly, but army officers too. It was their German friends who helped the couple move back to Paris from Biarritz where they found themselves penniless and on the verge of homelessness. \"Merezhkovsky flew up to the Nurnberg fires with the agitation of a newly born butterfly... By this time most of us stopped visiting them,\" wrote , a Green Lamp group member.\n\nExactly how and why did Merezhkovsky found himself on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) was blaming her own secretary Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man to come to the studio in the early days of the Nazi invasion into the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled \"Bolshevism and Humanity\" is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he was saying all through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been – and remains to this very day – only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.\n\"This is the end for us,\" Gippius allegedly commented, disgusted and horrified. In the days to come, though, husband and wife (as those who knew them later attested) were often expressing horror at the news of Nazis' atrocities on the Eastern front; according to Gippius' friend, poet Victor Mamchenko, Merezhkovsky far from supporting Hitler, in those days was actually condemning him.\n\nBiographer Zobnin doubts the fact that Merezhkovsky has been on the German radio at all, noting that none of the memoirists who mentioned it had himself heard Merezhkovsky speaking on air. All of those 'witnesses' were invariably referring to the printed version of the \"speech\" published in 1944 by \"Parizhsky Vestnik\". This document, according to Zobnin (the author of the first comprehensive Merezhkovsky biography published in Russia) was most certainly a montage fake, concocted by the Nazi propaganda out of the 1939 unpublished essay \"The Mystery of the Russian Revolution\" (on Dostoyevsky's \"Demons\" novel), bits and pieces thrown in. The researcher insists such speech could not have been broadcast in the late June: the couple resided in Biarritz and for an elderly person to give everybody a slip and somehow get to Paris was hardly probable.\n\nAdding to the confusion is the well-documented fact that Merezhkovsky has already made one speech mentioning Hitler and Joan of Arc in one breath. It happened in August 1940 at his 75th birthday celebration in Biarriz, and in a different context. In fact, his speech caused trouble because it was deemed too pro-Russian and anti-German. According to Teffi, one of the people present, — \nIrina Odoyevtseva independently corroborated this. \"He was going on about the Atlantis and its demise. For those who understood Russian it was obvious that what he meant was Germany's defeat and Russia's imminent victory, but the Germans never understood this and applauded,\" she remembered. All this, according to Zobnin, makes the \"infamous German radio speech\" looking very much like a Nazi propaganda myth, picked up first by Yuri Terapiano, then authenticised by numerous reiterations.\n\nFor the last three months of his life Merezhkovsky was working continuously in the couple's Paris flat, trying to finish \"Little Theresa\". On December 6 husband and wife returned from one of their regular walks and spent the evening, in Gippius' words, \"arguing, as usual, about Russia versus freedom dilemma.\" Skipping both supper and his habitual evening cigarette, Merezhkovsky went to his room early. Next morning the maid called Gippius to tell her the man was in some kind of trouble. Merezhkovsky was sitting unconscious next to a cold fireplace. The doctor arrived in 15 minutes' time and diagnosed brain hemorrhage. In half an hour Merezhkovsky was pronounced dead. \"...Me, I'm a worm, not man, slandered by humans, despised by peoples (Ps. 21, 7). But wrap itself into a chrysalis a hapless worm does only to break out as a shiny white, sunlight-like, resurrected butterfly,\" these were his last written words found on a piece of paper on a table. The funeral service was held on December 10 in the Orthodox church of Saint Aleksandr Nevsky. Dmitry Merezhkovsky was buried at the Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery, with just several people attending the ceremony.\n\nMerezhkovsky's first adopted philosophical trend was the then popular positivism. Soon, disillusioned in this idea, although never rejecting it wholly, Merezhkovsky turned to religion. Seeds of this hybrid (European positivism grafted to what's been described as \"the subjective idealism\" of Russian Orthodoxy) sown on the field of literature study brought forth a brochure entitled \"On the Causes of the Decline and the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature\". This manifesto gave a burgeoning Russian Symbolist movement both ideology and the name as such: Merezhkovsky was the first in Russia to speak of symbols as definitive means of cognizance in modern Art.\n\nIn the center of this new train of thought was the notion of \"rejecting the rational in favour of the intuitive\" by means of exploiting what the author termed as \"spirituality of a symbol,\" seeing the latter as a perfect means of describing Reality, otherwise unfathomable. Only through a symbol, according to Merezhkovsky, one could get to an object's deeper meaning, whereas (quoting, as he did, Tyutchev) \"thought, whilst being spoken, turns a lie\": \nAccording to scholar D.Churakov, Merezhkovsky, pronouncing \"the death of metaphysics\" and putting forward the idea that only language of symbols could be an adequate instrument for discovering the modern world's pattern of meanings, was unwillingly following Auguste Comte, the difference being that the latter was employing these ideas in scientific fields, while the former proposed to use them in literature and criticism.\n\nMerezhkovsky's next and most fundamental step ahead as a self-styled modernist philosophy leader was taken in tandem with his young intellectual wife Zinaida Gippius who from the first days of their meeting started generating new ideas for her husband to develop. Thus the Third Testament theory was born, or rather revived, transplanted from its Middle Ages Italian origins into the early 20th century's Russian ambience. It was the Third Testament that formed the basis of the early 20th-century Russian New Religious Consciousness movement which in turn kick started the Religious-Philosophical Society into action, again Gippius producing basic ideas for her husband to formulate. Borrowing the original idea from Joachim of Fiore, a 12th-century theologist, Merezhkovskys created and developed their own concept of man's full-circle religious evolution. In it the Bible was seen as a starting point with God having taken two steps towards Man, for the latter to respond with the third, logically conclusive one.\n\nAccording to Merezhkovsky, the First (Divine Father's) and the Second (Divine Son's) Testaments could be seen only as preliminary steps towards the Third one, that of the Holy Ghost. With the first maintaining the Law of God and the second – the Grace of God, what the third Testament should do is bring Liberation to the human race; the First Testament revealing God's power as the gospel Truth, the Second transforming the gospel Truth into Love, the Third translating Love into Liberation. In this last Kingdom \"pronounced and heard will be – the final, never before revealed name of the coming one: God the Liberator,\" according to the author.\n\nMerezhkovsky saw the Third Testament as a synthesis of the two original revelations: that \"about Earth\" (pre-Christian beliefs) and that \"about Heaven\" (Christianity). The Mystery of the Holy Trinity, when resolved, should link three elements into a circle, the great \"new Earth under the new Heavens,\" as promised in the Book of the Apocalypse. As Rozanov put it, \"Merezhkovsky's greatest innovation was this attempt to merge together the two — the Christian and the Heathen — poles of poignancy. To discover a 'tempting vice' in the greatest of virtues and the greatest of virtues in the tempting vice.\" This New Trinity concept implied that the all-inviting Holy Ghost was not a sexless spirit, but a female entity.\n\nHuman history, according to Merezhkovsky, was one ceaseless \"battle of two abysses\": the abyss of Flesh (as discovered by pre-Christians) and the abyss of Spirit (opened by Christianity's sexless ascetism). Pre-Christians celebrated flesh-driven sensuality at the expense of spirituality. Ascetic Christians brought about the rise of Spirit, at the expense of sex. Merezhkovsky declared the dialectical inevitability of thesis and antithesis' coming together, of the spiritual and the sexual poles uniting on a higher, celestial level.\n\nIn his own words, \"Being aware of myself in my body, I'm at the root of personality. Being aware of myself in the other one's body, I'm at the root of sex. Being aware of myself in all human bodies, I am at the root of unity\". Noticing that one of the Aramaic languages translates Spirit as Rucha, a female entity, Merezhkovsky interpreted the Holy Trinity as Father and Son's unity in the higher being, their common godly Mother. It is the latter's Kingdom Come that the Third Testament was supposed to lead to. Seeing both God and man as intrinsically unisexual, Merezhkovsky regarded a male/female schism to be a symptom of imperfection, the cause for primal human being's fatal disintegration.\n\nIn the modern times, according to Merezhkovsky, both monastic and ascetic Christianity will cease to exist. Art would not just adopt religious forms, but become an integral part of religion, the latter taken in broader concept. Human evolution as he saw it, would lead to merging of whatever had been polarized: sex and spirit, religion and culture, male and female, et cetera — bringing about Kingdom Come, not 'out there', but 'here on Earth'.\n\nMan's evolutional progress towards the Third Testament Kingdom Come won't be without some revolutionary upheavals, according to Merezhkovsky, will be strewn with \"catastrophes\", most of them dealing with the \"revolution of Spirit.\" The consequence of such revolution would bring about gradual change in the nature of religion itself, the latter taking under its spacious wing not only man's sensual liberation but also the latter's \"freedom of rebellion.\" \"We are human only as long as we're rebels,\" Merezhkovsky insisted, expressing what some saw as a proto-existentialist idea.\n\nOne result of the \"revolution of Spirit\" should be the severing of ties between state and religion, according to Merezhkovsky. \"The Church – not the old, but the new, eternal, universal one – is as opposite to the idea of the state as an absolute truth is opposing an absolute lie,\" he declared in an open letter to Berdyaev.\n\nB.Rozental, analyzing Merezhkovsky's political and religious philosophy, thus summed up the writer's position: \"The Law amounts to violence... The difference between legitimate power that holds violence 'in reserve' and violence itself is but a matter of degree: sinful are both. Autocracy and murder are nothing more than the two extreme forms of exhibiting [criminal] power.\" Interpreting the Biblical version of the human history as a sequence of revolutionary events, Merezhkovsky saw religion and revolution as inseparable. It is just that for a social revolution to succeed, spiritual revolution should always come one step ahead of it. In Russia the lack of the latter brought about the former's fiasco, with Antichrist taking hold of things, he argued.\n\nIn the 1920s Merezhkovsky lost interest in the religious anarchism doctrine. In his later years he became close to ecumenical ideals, prophesying the Kingdom Come as a synthesis of \"Peter, Paul and John's principles\", that is, bringing Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox traditions together.\n\nThroughout his lifetime Dmitry Merezhkovsky polarized opinion in his native Russia, bringing upon himself both praise and scorn, occasionally from the same quarters. According to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Merezhkovsky became Russia's first ever \"new-type, universal kind of a dissident who managed to upset just about everybody who thought themselves to be responsible for guarding morality and order\":\nIn the words of a modern biographer, \"he will find his place in history alongside Marquis de Sade, Nietzsche and Henry Miller, those classics who only through being condemned and ostracized by the many could be approached and appreciated by the few.\" \"I was disliked and scolded in Russia, loved and praised abroad, but misunderstood, both here and there,\" Merezhkovsky wrote in a letter to Nikolai Berdyaev.\n\nMerezhkovsky has been given credit for his exceptional erudition, the scientific approach to writing, literary gift and stylistic originality. Seen in retrospect as the first ever (and, arguably, the only one) Russian \"cabinet writer of a European type,\" Merezhkovsky was, according to Berdyayev, \"one of the best-educated people in Saint Petersburg of the first quarter of the 20th century.\" Korney Chukovsky, pondering on the dire state of the early 20th century Russia's cultural elite, admitted that \"the most cultured of them all\" was this \"mysterious, unfathomable, almost mythical creature, Merezhkovsky\". Anton Chekov insisted that the Russian Academy of Sciences should appoint Merezhkovsky its honorary academic, in as early as 1902.\n\nMerezhkovsky was the first in Russia to formulate the basic principles of Symbolism and Modernism, as opposed to 'decadence', a tag he was battling with. Never aspiring to a leading role in the movement, he soon became, according to I. Koretskaya, \"a kind of handy encyclopedia for the ideology of Symbolism,\" which others \"could borrow aesthetic, socio-historical and even moral ideas from.\" Having added a new (\"thought-driven\") dimension to the genre of historical novel and turning it into a modern art form, Merezhkovsky influenced Andrey Bely and Aleksey Remizov, as well as Valery Bryusov, Aleksey N. Tolstoy, Mikhail Bulgakov and Mark Aldanov. It was Merezhkovsky who introduced such concepts as a \"modernist novel\" and a \"symbolic historical novel\" to the conservative Russian literature scene of the late 1890s.\n\nMerezhkovsky was praised as an engaging essayist and \"a master of quote-juggling.\" Some critics loathed the repetitiveness in Merezhkovsky's prose, others admired his (in a broad sense) musical manner of employing certain ideas almost as symphonic themes, which was new at the time.\n\nNo less influential, even if so much more controversial, were Merezhkovsky's philosophical, religious and political ideas. Alongside the obvious list of contemporary followers (Bely, Blok, etc.; almost all of them later became detractors) deeply interested in his theories were political figures (Fondaminsky, Kerensky, Savinkov), psychologists (Freud), philosophers (Berdyaev, Rickert, Stepun), lawyers (Kowalewsky). Thomas Mann wrote of Merezhkovsky as of a \"genius critic and specialist in a world psychology, second only to Nietzsche.\" Notable other Germans influenced by Merezhkovsky included Arthur Moeller van den Bruck and Alfred Rosenberg\n\nLater researchers noted Merezhkovsky's willingness to question dogmas and thwart tradition with disregard to public opinion, never shying controversy and even scandal. Crucial in this context (according to O.Dafier) was his \"quest for ways of overcoming deep crisis which came as a result of the Russian traditionalist Church losing its credibility.\"\n\nIn Russia the general response to Merezhkovsky's literary, cultural and social activities was negative. His prose, even if on the face of it stylistically flawless and occasionally accessible, was, critics argued, an elitist thing unto itself, \"hermetically closed for the uninitiated majority.\" \"Having isolated himself from the real life, Merezhkovsky built up the inner temple for his own personal use. Me-and-culture, me-and-Eternity – those were his recurring themes,\" wrote in 1911 Leon Trotsky.\n\nFor all his scientifically strict, academic approach to the process of collecting and re-processing material, contemporary academia, with little exception, ridiculed Merezhkovsky, dismissing him as a gifted charlatan, bent on rewriting history in accordance with his own current ideological and philosophical whims. Due to his incorrigible, as many saw it, tendency towards inconsistency, Merezhkovsky's old allies were deserting him, while new ones approached him warily. Vasily Rozanov wrote in 1909: \nAnother former friend, Minsky, questioned Merezhkovsky's credibility as a critic, finding in his biographies a tendency to see in his subjects only things that he wanted to see, skillfully \"re-moulding questions into instant answers.\"\n\nFor all his religiosity, Merezhkovsky was never popular with either Russian Orthodox Church officials or the religious intellectual elite of the time, people like Sergey Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky and Lev Shestov fiercely denouncing his ideas and projects. Similarly, the reputation of a radical Social democrat hasn't made Merezhkovsky popular in the leftist literary camp. He was variously described as \"an anti-literature phenomenon\" (Viktor Shklovsky), \"the greatest corpse in the Russian literature\" (Ivanov-Razumnik) and \"a book-worm\", totally \"foreign to all things human\" (Korney Chukovsky).\n\nThe writer's work published in emigration was, according to the 1934 Soviet Literary encyclopedia \"the telling example of the ideological degradation and cultural degeneration of the White emigres.\" Maxim Gorky's verdict: \"Dmitry Merezhkovsky, a well-known God-admirer of a Christian mode, is a small man whose literary activity is akin to that of a type-writer: each type is clear and well-read, but it's soul-less and boring,\" served as a leitmotif of the Soviet literary officialdom's view on Merezhkovsky for decades. In the Soviet times the writer was (in the words of Alexander Men) \"aggressively forgotten,\" his works unofficially banned up until the early 1990s, when the floodgate of re-issues opened the way for serious critical analysis of Merezhkovsky's life and legacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1960, he received a degree in philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires. After graduation, he obtained a scholarship from CONICET to study Social Anthropology Laboratory at the Collège de France with Claude Lévi-Strauss. Verón was in charge of the first translation into spanish of \"Structural Anthropology\", an anthology of Lévi-Strauss's work on that subject, published by Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires (Eudeba) in 1961. He recognizes Lévi-Strauss as his main influence during this period. In 1962 he attended a seminar by Roland Barthes at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, where he discovered Saussurian semiotics, which became a point of departure for him in future work.\n\nUpon returning to Argentina, Verón became a professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1967 and 1968, he directed the Center for Social Research at the Torcuato di Tella Institute.

{"id": "49289326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49289326", "title": "Everett Dean Martin", "text": "Everett Dean Martin\n\nEverett Dean Martin (July 5, 1880 – May 10, 1941) was an American minister, writer, journalist, instructor, lecturer, social psychologist, social philosopher, and an advocate of adult education. He was an instructor and lecturer at The New School for Social Research in New York City from 1921-1929, and served on the Board of Directors of The New School from 1925-1932. He was the final Director of the People's Institute of Cooper Union in New York City from 1922-1934. Martin was born in Jacksonville, Illinois on July 5, 1880. Graduating with honors at the age of 24 from Illinois College in Jacksonville, he moved on to Chicago, attending McCormick Theological Seminary from 1904 until his ordination as a Congregational Minister in 1907. Martin received a Litt.D (Doctor of Letters) degree from Illinois College in 1907. He was best known for his advocacy of the liberal education of adults, which he saw as “an antidote to both the irrationality of the crowd and the power of propaganda.”\n\nIn 1907, he married Esther W. Kirk of Jacksonville, Illinois. They had three children: Mary, Margaret, and Elizabeth.\n\nFrom 1906-1908, Martin was Pastor of the First Congregational Church (now called The First Church of Lombard) of Lombard, Illinois. From 1908-1911, Martin was Pastor of the People’s Church in Dixon, Illinois. Martin was minister of the First Unitarian Church of Des Moines, Iowa, 1911-1915\nMartin was a featured columnist for the Des Moines Register during the years 1914-1915.\n\nIn 1915, his successful life took a radical shift in course. He divorced his wife of eight years and left the professional ministry. He moved to New York and began writing for the New York Globe. Over the next 20 years, Martin developed into a successful writer and forged a national reputation as a charismatic public lecturer, often attracting a crowd of a thousand or more at the People's Institute, a major center for adult education in New York City. Martin's second marriage in 1915 to Persis Eastman Rowell also ended in divorce, they had one son, Everett Eastman.\n\nIn \"The Behavior of Crowds\" (1920), his first nationally reviewed book, he posed what he saw as the dilemma of the modern age: a technological information revolution that made it possible, in the absence of an adequate educational system, to influence ignorant men and women with propaganda and half-truths. Unscrupulous demagogues, corrupt politicians, manipulative advertisers, and revolutionary ideologues found ready-made audiences when they appealed to the baser (a subconscious urge, behavior, or intuition directed by primeval, animalistic, self-serving, and/or ignoble motivations) instincts.\n\nMartin was a classical, individualistic liberal, in the tradition of the Renaissance humanists and the authors of The Federalist Papers. He believed in restrained government and in the self-selection of intellectually promising students through appropriate programs of adult education.\n\nHis most famous and widely read work, \"The Meaning of a Liberal Education\", appeared in 1926, the same year he helped found the American Association for Adult Education. When his book, \"The Meaning of a Liberal Education\" was released in 1926, Frederick Paul Keppel, the president of the Carnegie Corporation proclaimed it as “the most important contribution to the understanding of adult education… this far in the United States.” In March 1928, John Dewey responded to a request from Marie Mattingly Meloney, editor of the New York Herald-Tribune Sunday Magazine, and offered his recommendations on recently published texts on education. Dewey wrote, “I think the best educational books of recent publication are…Martin, \"The Meaning of a Liberal Education\". This was not the first time Dewey recommended Everett Dean Martin’s book. In 1927, the editors of the Journal of the National Education Association approached Dewey and asked, “What book have you recently found especially worthwhile? Something that you have read easily, eagerly, and with profit, either in the field of education or out of it.” Dewey identified two books; one of them was Martin’s \"The Meaning of a Liberal Education\".\n\nFrom 1919-1922, Martin served as chairman of The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.\n\nMartin was an instructor and lecturer at The New School for Social Research in New York City from 1921-1929, and served on the Board of Directors of The New School from 1925-1932. He taught classes in sociology, psychology, social behavior, and adult education. At The New School, Martin taught alongside other prominent intellectuals of the day including, Alfred Adler, Norman Angell, Harry Elmer Barnes, Charles Austin Beard, Edwin Grant Conklin, Herbert J. Davenport, John Dewey, Lawrence K. Frank, Felix Frankfurter, Alexander Goldenweiser, Joseph Jastrow, Alvin Saunders Johnson, Horace Kallen, Alfred Kreymborg, Eduard C. Lindeman, Walter Lippmann, Frederick Macaulay, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Gorham Munson, Moissaye Joseph Olgin, Harry Allen Overstreet, James Harvey Robinson, Mark Van Doren, Thorstein Veblen, and Leo Wolman.\n\nAmong the courses Martin taught at The New School between 1921 and 1929 were: Introduction to Social Psychology, Fundamental Problems in Adult Education, The Process of Adult Learning, Psychology and the Problems of Social Behavior, Some Applications of Social Psychology, Studies on Social Behavior, and Psychological Problems of Social Reconstruction. An example of Martin’s lecture topics in from a 1925 course on social philosophy taught at The New School include: The Psychology of the Crowd; The So-Called Group Mind; Has Man a Social or ”Herd” Instinct?; The Psychology of Mass Appeal; Leadership in the Crowd; Reform Legislation; The Present Industrial Transition.\n\nWhy is this seminal individual virtually ignored amidst the ranks of the founders of the adult education movement? Apparently Martin’s wholehearted commitment to liberal education has placed him in juxtaposition with the early proponents of practical education in the eyes of contemporary scholars. Here is an individual virtually dismissed not only in the history of adult education, but also in the contemporary exploration of adult education.”\n\nAmong those recruited to the programs of the People's Institute of Cooper Union during Martin’s tenure as Director (1926-1934) had been Mortimer Adler, Scott Buchanan, Will Durant, Clifton Fadiman, and Hilda Worthington Smith, all soon to surpass Martin in fame and influence. Yet, in his heyday, Martin was regarded as one of the leading figures in adult education in the United States.\n\nMorse A. Cartwright, who was the Executive Director of the American Association for Adult Education from its founding in 1926 to its ultimate dissolution and transformation in 1949, considered Martin to be the \"spiritual father\" of the association in particular and of the entire movement in general. Cartwright went on to say in his eulogy for Martin, published in the Journal of Adult Education, that:\n\n“. . . Thousands who had heard him lecture in all parts of the United States, more thousands who had read his numerous books and articles on philosophical and psychological subjects, and the large audience which for years listened to his notable Friday night addresses and discussions in the Great Hall of Cooper Union in New York, all attested to the challenging qualities of his mind and heart.”\n\nIn 1934 Martin was asked to direct the Department of Social Philosophy at the Cooper Union in New York through a $15,000 per year grant from the Carnegie Corporation through his long-time friend Frederick Paul Keppel. Martin remained in this position until 1936 when he accepted an opportunity to move to California and direct an experimental program in teaching at Claremont Colleges.\n\nMartin was a Professor of Social Psychology at Scripps College in Claremont, California from 1936 up until his death in 1941.\n\nMartin died on May 10, 1941 of a heart attack in Claremont, California at the age of 60. Martin's third wife, Daphne Crane Drake, whom he married in 1931, survived him. Mrs. Everett Dean Martin (Daphne Crane Drake) was a former President of the Child Study Association of America (1934).\n\n\n\n"}

When the idea of \"ganying\" first appeared in Chinese classics from the late Warring States period (475-221 BCE), it referred to a cosmological principle of \"stimulus and response\" between things of the same kind, analogous with vibratory sympathetic resonance. Early schools of Chinese philosophy adapted \"ganying\" into different folk theories of causality, such as universal resonance influencing all interrelated things in Daoism, and ethical resonance between Heaven and humans in Confucianism. \"Ganying\" resonance was later used to mean miraculous \"moral retribution\" in Chinese folk religion, and \"prayers being heard\" in Chinese Buddhism. In the modern period, Chinese \"ganying\" \"stimulus and response\" was used to translate some Western scientific loanwords (such as \"diàncí gǎnyìng\" 電磁感應 \"electromagnetic induction\").\n\nThe Chinese collocation \"gǎnyìng\" combines \"gǎn\" 感 \"feel, sense; move, touch; (traditional Chinese medicine) be affected (by cold)\" and \"yìng\" traditional 應 or simplified 应 \"respond; consent, comply; adapt to; cope/deal with; apply, applied\", which is also pronounced \"yīng\" \"promise/agree (to do something); answer; respond; (auxiliary) should; ought to\" (DeFrancis 2003: 284, 1149).\n\nSeveral early texts (below) use an interchangeable synonym of \"ying\" < Old Chinese \"*[q](r)əәŋ\" 應 \"respond; resonate\" : \"dòng\" < *\"[Cəә-m-]tˤoŋʔ\" 動 \"move; shake; set in motion\". \"Dong\" can mean \"ganying\", for instance, \"gǎndòng\" 感動 \"move; touch (somebody)\" and \"dòngrén\" 動人 \"arouse interest/feelings\". Sharf (2002: 120) says interpreting the Chinese philosophical term \"gan\" \"stimulus; affect; etc.\" is rendered problematic by the modern distinction between ontology and epistemology. The ontological range of meanings, insofar as to \"gan\" someone is to effect the mind of another person, as evident in the (c. 121 CE) \"Shuowen jiezi\" dictionary definition of \"gan\" as 動人心也 \"to move a person's mind\", suggesting English translation equivalents such as \"incite,\" \"agitate,\" \"rouse,\" and \"stimulate\". The epistemological range of \"gan\" meanings, insofar as it implies an inner experience or cognition that may or may not correlate with an event in the external world, is translatable as to \"feel,\" \"experience,\" \"sense,\" or \"become aware of.\"\n\nBoth the logographs \"gǎn\" 感 and \"yìng\" 應 are classified as radical-phonetic characters written with the \"heart-mind radical\" 心 (typically used to write words for feelings and thoughts) and phonetic indicators of \"xián\" 咸 \"all; Hexagram 31\" and \"yīng\" 鷹 \"hawk; eagle\" minus the \"bird radical\" 鳥 (Bishop 2012).\n\nBilingual Chinese-English dictionaries give a variety of translation equivalents for Modern Standard Chinese \"ganying\". \nThe most commonly given (and copied) meanings are \"respond; response\" and \"electromagnetic induction\".\n\nThe history of \"ganying\" spans over two millennia, going from an ancient cosmological theory to modern scientific terminology.\n\nAncient texts use string resonance or sympathetic vibration between paired Chinese musical instruments as the most common analogy for \"(gan)ying\" \"cosmic resonance\". The \"Zhuangzi\", \"Lüshi chunqiu\" (twice), \"Huainanzi\" (twice), and \"Chuci\" all mention plucking the classical pentatonic \"gong\" 宮 and \"jue\" 角 notes on the \"se\" 瑟 \"a 25-string zither\"; but the \"Chunqiu fanlu\" mentions the \"gong\" and \"shang\" 商 notes on either the \"se\" or \"qin\" 琴 \"a 7-string zither\". Joseph Needham (1962:130) notes both these instruments are commonly mistranslated as \"lutes\", but are actually \"zithers\", describing the \"qin\" as \"a half-tube zither\" and the \"se\" (which only survives in the descendent \"zheng\" 箏) as \"a horizontal psaltery\". In modern terms of the solmization stave, \"gong\", \"shang\", and \"jue\" correspond to \"do\", \"re\", and \"mi\". Click here to hear the \"gong\" \"Original Tuning\", \"shang\" \"Sharpened Re Tuning\", and \"jue\" \"Lowered Third-string Tuning\" on the Chinese zither.\n\nThe earliest records of \"ganying\" are in Chinese classics from the late Warring States period (475-221 BCE), when the \"Hundred Schools of Thought\" developed competing philosophical doctrines, including correlative resonance.\n\nIn the (c. 4th-3rd century BCE) \"Yijing\" \"Classic of Changes\", the \"Commentary on the Decision\" for Hexagram 31 \"Xian\" 咸 \"Influence (Wooing)\" uses \"ganying\" 感應 to explain the Old Chinese phonetic connection between *\"[g]ˤr[əә]m\" 咸 \"all; everywhere\" and *\"kˤ[əә]mʔ\" 感 \"move emotionally\".\nINFLUENCE [咸] means stimulation [感]. The weak is above, the strong below. The forces of the two stimulate and respond [感應] to each other, so that they unite. Keeping Still and joyousness. The masculine subordinates itself to the feminine. Hence it is said: \"Success. Perseverance furthers. To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.\" Heaven and earth stimulate each other, and all things take shape and come into being. The holy man stimulates the hearts of men, and the world attains peace and rest. If we contemplate the outgoing stimulating influences, we can know the nature of heaven and earth and all beings. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 2011: 540-541) \n\nLe Blanc (1985: 9, 140) says the roots for the \"key notion\" of resonance can be traced back to the older strata of the \"Yijing\", citing an early saying preserved in Hexagram 1 \"Qian\" 乾's line interpretation.\nNine in the fifth place means: \"Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great man.\" What does this signify? The Master said: Things that accord in tone vibrate together [同聲相應, repeated in \"Zhuangzi\" below]. Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one another [同氣相求]. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. Thus the sage rises, and all creatures follow him with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows it kind. (tr. Wilhelm & Baynes 2011: 382) \n\nThe (c. 400 BCE) \"Xiaojing\" \"Classic of Filial Piety\" has a section named \"Ganying\" 感應, translated as \"The Influence of Filial Piety and the Response to It\" (Legge) or \"Feeling and Responding by the Sprits\" (Feng). It begins with an explanation of how the gods and spirits respond to human activities,\nThe Master said, \"Anciently, the intelligent kings served their fathers with filial piety, and therefore they served Heaven with intelligence. They served their mothers with filial piety, and therefore they served Earth with discrimination. They pursued the right course with reference to their (own) seniors and juniors, and therefore they secured the regulation of the relations between superiors and inferiors (throughout the kingdom). When Heaven and Earth were served with intelligence and discrimination, the spiritual intelligences displayed (their retributive power).\" (16, tr. Legge 1879: 484-485) \n\nThe (3rd century BCE) Confucian classic \"Xunzi\" repeats the above \"Yijing\" folk-etymology that the \"xian\" < *\"[g]ˤr[əә]m\" hexagram is the phonetic in the character for \"gan\" 感 < *\"kˤ[əә]mʔ\" \"stimulate' influence\".\nThe hexagram \"Xian\", \"All\", of the \"Changes\" shows the relation of husband to wife. The Way of relations between husband and wife cannot be allowed to be incorrect, for it is the root source for the relations between lord and minister, father and son. The hexagram \"Xian\" [咸] means \"influence\" [感]. It uses the high to descend to the low, the male to descend to the female. It is weak and pliant above and strong and hard below.\" (27.38, tr. Knoblock 1994: 216) \n\nThe \"Xunzi\" uses \"ganying\" \"joint resonance\" to explain the harmonious connection between a person's \"xing\" 性 \"inborn nature\" and \"jing\" 精 \"essence; senses\".\nThese are the common names that apply to man. That which is as it is from the time of birth is called the nature of man [性]. That which is harmonious from birth, which is capable of perceiving through the senses and of responding to stimulus spontaneously [精合感應] and without effort, is also called nature [性]. The likes and dislikes, delights and angers, griefs and joys of the nature are called emotions [情]. When the emotions are aroused and the mind makes a choice from among them, this is called thought [慮]. (22, tr. Watson 2003: 139) \n\nThe (c. 3rd-2nd centuries BCE) Daoist classic \"Zhuangzi\" contains an early version of the zither string resonance analogy, which Sharf (2002: 83) describes as undoubtedly \"the single most persuasive demonstration of the principle of resonance\".\n\nZhuangzi tells the story to his friend Huizi in order to explain that the five predominant schools of philosophy, Confucianism, Mohism, Yangism, School of Names, and \"Pingism\" [uncertain]), merely debate like the five notes of the pentatonic scale, while Daoism contains and transcends them like an untuned note that resonates all 25 strings of the \"se\" 瑟 zither.\n\"Well, then,\" said Master Chuang, \"there are the four schools of the Confucians, the Mohists, the Yangists, and the Pingists. Adding yours, master, it makes five. Which of you is actually right? Or may it be someone like Hasty Ninny [Lu Ju 魯遽]? His disciple said to him, 'I have attained your way, master. In winter I can light a cooking fire under a three-legged vessel and in summer I can make ice'. 'That's merely to attract [召] yang with yang and yin with yin'; said Hasty Ninny. 'It's not what I mean by the Way. I will show you my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed one of them in the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he plucked the note \"do\" [宮] on one, \"do\" resonated [動] on the other, and when he plucked the note \"mi\" [角] on one, \"mi\" resonated [動] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [動] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?\" (23, tr. Mair 1994: 243) \n\nOne \"Zhuangzi\" context uses \"gan\" with \"ying\": \"The sage walks with heaven in life and evolves with things in death. In stillness, he shares the same integrity as yin; in movement, he shares the same current as yang. He is not the founder of fortune, nor is he the initiator of misfortune. He responds [應] when affected [感], moves when pressed, and arises only when he has no other choice. He rids himself of knowledge and precedent, conforming to the principle of heaven.\" (15, tr. Mair 1994: 145).\n\nTwo others use \"ying\" to describe acoustic resonance: \"Similar categories follow each other [同類相從] and similar sounds respond to each other [同聲相應]. Indeed, this is the principle of heaven.\" (31, tr. Mair 1994: 319), \"To one who does not dwell in himself, the forms of things will manifest themselves. His movement is like water, his stillness is like a mirror. His response is like an echo [其應若響], indistinct as though it were absent, quiet as though it were pure.\" (33, tr. Mair 1994: 341).\n\nTwo chapters of Lü Buwei's (c. 240 BCE) wide-ranging \"Lüshi chunqiu\" \"The Annals of Lu Buwei\" repeat the \"ying\" 應 \"acoustic resonance\" zither-string analogy, and explain how phenomena that are of the same \"lei\" 類 \"kind; category\" mutually \"zhao\" 召 \"resonate; attract\" one another. \nThings belonging to the same category naturally attract each other [類同相召]; things that share the same ethers [\"qi\" 氣] naturally join together; and notes that are comparable naturally resonate [應] to one another. Strike the note \"gong\" [宮] on one instrument and other strings tuned to the \"gong\" note will vibrate [應]; strike the note \"jue\" [角] and other strings tuned to the \"jue\" note will vibrate [應]. Water flowing across leveled earth will flow to the damp places; light evenly stacked firewood, and the fire will catch where it is driest. Clouds above a mountain look like shrubs; above water they resemble fish scales; above an arid landscape they look like leaping fire; above a flood they resemble rolling waves. Without exception, everything manifests signs that show men it shares the same category with that which creates it. Thus, \"use the dragon to bring rain, and use a form to pursue a shadow. Wherever an army has camped, brambles and briars are sure to grow.\" The natural occurrence of fortune and misfortune is considered by the masses to be a matter of destiny, but how could they know its true source? (13.2, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 283-284) \n\nThings belonging to the same category naturally attract each other [類同相召]; things that share the same ethers naturally join together; and musical notes that are close naturally resonate with one another [應]. Thus, strike the note \"gong\" [宮] on one instrument, and other strings tuned to the note \"gong\" will respond [應], or strike the note \"jue\" [角], and the other strings tuned to the note \"jue\" will vibrate [動]. Use the dragon to bring rain, Use a form to pursue a shadow. The natural occurrence of fortune and misfortune is considered by the masses to be a matter of destiny; but how could they know its true source? Hence, when a state is in disorder, it does not merely remain in disorder but attracts bandits. Were it only to remain disordered, it would not necessarily perish; but since it attracts bandits, there is no means by which it could survive. (2.40, tr. tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 522-523) \n\nXinzhong Yao's encyclopedia of Confucianism (2003 2: 613) defines \"ganying\" as \"a mutual resonance or mutual sympathy between two or more phenomena\", and says that in the \"Lüshi chunqiu\", \"the actions of the ruler elicit certain responses from Heaven, which are manifested through omens. In this system of resonances, the depth of the sovereign's moral cultivation is directly proportional to the prosperity of the realm.\" The ancient Chinese view that anomalies in the heavens, disturbances on earth, earthquakes, avalanches, sightings of unusual animals, and other such \"wonders\" (怪) were omens of the king's behavior has been termed \"phenomenalism\" by Western sinologists (Sharf 2002: 88).\n\nDuring the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), scholars and philosophers adapted the notion of \"ganying\" into different fields. For Han cosmologists, \"ganying\" was important in both human-cosmos and state-cosmos correspondences. During the Han era, Henderson (1984: 37) says both imperial ideology and political criticism rested on a world view shaped by correlative cosmology, which facilitated the wide dissemination of correlative modes of thinking among members of the politically-engaged Han elite.\n\nThe (c. 3rd century BCE-2nd century CE) \"Chuci\" \"Songs of Chu\" poem \"Reckless Remonstrance\" gives examples of cosmic resonance in acoustics, biology, and mythology. \nLike sounds harmonize together [同音者相]; Creatures mate with their own kind. The flying bird cries out to the flock; The deer calls, searching for his friends. If you strike \"gong\", then \"gong\" responds [應]; If you hit \"jue\", then \"jue\" vibrates. The tiger roars, and the wind of the valley comes; The dragon soars, and the radiant clouds come flying. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 257) \nCompare the \"Yijing\" (above) saying, \"Things that accord in tone vibrate together [同聲相應] ... Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger.\"\n\nThe \"Chunqiu Fanlu\" \"Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals\", which is attributed to the Confucianist Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BCE) but compiled later, describes how humans are in a system of relationships with the cosmos, and elevates the notion of resonance to \"a full-fledged cosmological theory\" (Sharf 2002: 84). This concept was called \"tian-ren ganying\" 天人感應 \"resonance between Heaven and humans\", a phrase that first appears in the (3rd-century CE) \"Book of Wei\" history of Emperor Cao Pi (r. 220-226), and was later used as the title of another text attributed to Dong Zhongshu: \"Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind\". Dong Zhongshu is sometimes credited with having formalized the doctrine of \"ganying\" and giving it classical expression (Henderson 1984: 24).\n\nChapter 57 \"Tunglei xiangdong\" 同類相動 \"Mutual Activation of Like Categories\" also uses the zither string resonance analogy.\nIf water is poured on level ground it will avoid the parts which are dry and move towards those that are wet. If (two) identical pieces of firewood are exposed to fire, the latter will avoid the damp and ignite the dry one. All things reject what is different (to themselves) and follow what is akin. Thus it is that if (two) [\"qi\"] are similar, they will coalesce; if notes correspond, they resonate [應]. The experimental proof [驗] of this is extraordinarily clear. Try tuning musical instruments. The \"kung\" [宮] note or the \"shang\" [商] note struck upon one lute will be answered by [應] the \"kung\" or the \"shang\" notes from other stringed instruments. They sound by themselves. This is nothing miraculous [神], but the Five Notes being in relation; they are what they are according to the numbers [數] (whereby the world is constructed). (Similarly) lovely things summon others among the class of lovely things; repulsive things summon others among the class of repulsive things. This arises from the complementary way in which a thing of the same class responds [類之相應而起也] as for instance if a horse whinnies another horse whinnies in answer [應], and if a cow lows, another cow lows in response [應]. When a great ruler is about to arise auspicious omens first appear; when a ruler is about to be destroyed, there are baleful ones beforehand. Things indeed summon each other, like to like, a dragon bringing rain, a fan driving away heat, the place where an army has been being thick with thorns. Things, whether lovely or repulsive, all have an origin. (If) they are taken to constitute destiny (it is because) no man knows where that origin is. . . It is not only the two [\"qi\"] of the Yin and the Yang which advance and retreat [進退] according to their categories. Even the origins of the varied fortunes, good and bad, of men, behave in the same way. There is no happening that does not depend for its beginning upon something prior, to which it responds because (it belongs to the same) category, and so moves [而物以類應之而動者也] ... (As I said) when the note \"kung\" is struck forth from a lute, other \"kung\" strings (nearby) reverberate of themselves in complementary (resonance) [應]; a case of comparable things being affected according to the classes to which they belong [此物之以類動者也]. They are moved by a sound which has no visible form, and when men can see no form accompanying motion and action, they describe the phenomenon as a 'spontaneous sounding' [自鳴]. And wherever there is a mutual reaction [相動] without anything visible (to account for it) they describe the phenomenon as 'spontaneously so' [自然]. But in truth there is no (such thing as) 'spontaneously so' (in this sense). (I.e. everything in the universe is attuned to certain other things, and changes as they change.) That there are (circumstances which) cause a man to become what in fact he is, we know. So also things do have a real causative (power), invisible though this may be. (1, tr. Needham 1954: 281-282) \nNeedham (1956: 281) explains the importance of pattern and organism in Dong Zhongshu's philosophy: \"The symbolic correlations or correspondences all formed part of one colossal pattern. Things behaved in particular ways not necessarily because of prior actions or impulsions of other things, but because their position in the ever-moving cyclical universe was such that they were endowed with intrinsic natures which made that behaviour inevitable for them. ... They were thus parts in existential dependence upon the whole world-organism. And they reacted upon one another not so much by mechanical impulsion or causation as by a kind of mysterious resonance.\"\n\nLiu An's (c. 139 BCE) \"Huainanzi\" \"Masters of Huainan\" is second only to the writings of Dong Zhongshu (see \"Chunqiu fanlu\" below) as a source for sympathetic-resonance theory in the Han period (Sharf 2002: 85). According to Charles Le Blanc (1985: 9), the \"Huainanzi\" significantly advanced Chinese cosmological theory, largely due to the use of resonance as a catalyst that blended together ideas from the School of Yin-Yang (such as \"ganying\") with ideas from Daoism (such as \"wuwei\").\n\nWhile all 21 chapters in the \"Huainanzi\" incorporate aspects of cosmological resonance, and chapter 6 \"Lanming\" 覽冥, translated as \"Peering into the Obscure\" or \"Surveying Obscurities\", is entirely focused on elaborating resonance, the word \"ganying\" does not appear once in the text. This \"Huainanzi\" uses \"ying\" 應 151 times, frequently to denote \"ganying\", and uses \"gan\" 感 39 times. The \"Huainanzi\" translators John S. Major et al. (2010: 210) explain that \"gan\" means \"an influence; to influence; a stimulus; to stimulate; to evoke a response\" and appears twice in chapter 6; and \"ying\" means \"to respond; a response\" and appears 7 times. The words \"gan\" and \"ying\" only co-occur a few times, but these instances conform exactly to the meaning of resonance that one expects from the concept of \"ganying\"; for example, \"when stimulated they respond\" (\"gan er ying\" 感而應, 7.7), and \"the stimulus impels a response externally\" (\"gan dong ying yu wai\" 感動應於外, 10.27). These scholars (Major et al. 2010: 210) conclude that when the \"Huainanzi\" was written in the mid-2nd century BCE, \"ganying\" \"resonance\" itself had not yet stabilized as a technical term for the phenomenon. \"Huainanzi\" chapter 12 \"Daoying\" 道應 \"Responses of the Way\" explains (Major et al. 2010:430), \"the ruler must choose the appropriate response (\"ying\") grounded in the Way that is evoked (\"gan\") by the circumstances of the moment\".\n\n\"Huainanzi\" translators proposed two hypotheses for the origins of \"ganying\" philosophy. Charles Le Blanc (1985: 143) asserts that the idea originated from musical resonance. John S. Major believes the ideas of Zou Yan (305-240 BCE), founder of the School of Yin-Yang, had a pervading influence on the \"Huainanzi\", and suggests that the doctrine of \"qi\" and \"ganying\" resonance could perhaps be regarded as a genuine creation of the Zuo Yan school.\nThe question is, how do these effects come about in the absence of mathematical or mechanical links among the things in a single category? The answer, supplied by Tsou Yen and his school, is that things in a category \"vibrate\" resonantly together, as two identically-tuned lute strings will vibrate together, and do so through the medium of \"ch'i\", an invisible, aethereal, vibrant substance that permeates the universe. (Major 1993: 34) \n\nThe \"Huainanzi\" has two versions of the earlier \"Zhuangzi\" zither string resonance analogy. Both Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 omit the reference to Lu Ju and his disciple who attracted \"yang\" to light a fire and \"yin\" to make ice, and each account adds a different interpretation. The shorter version refers to the Dao's mysterious ineffability.\nNow, one who makes [something] true uses the level; one who makes something straight uses the marking cord. Making true or straight without being in the line or on the level is an art that cannot be shared. When one strikes the [note] \"gong\", \"gong\" responds [應]; pluck the \"jue\" [string], and [another] \"jue\" [string] moves [動]. This is the mutual response of identical tones [同音之相應]. What does not correspond to any of the five tones, but to which all twenty-five strings respond [應], is the Way, which cannot be transmitted. Thus, solitude is the lord of form [形之君]; silence is the ruler of tone [音之主]. (11.14, tr. Major et al. 2010: 417) \nThe longer version adds a mystical \"Great Penetration\" associated with a Daoist \"Zhenren\" \"True/Perfected Person\".\nNow when a person who tunes a \"se\" plays [the note] \"gong\", [another] \"gong\" [string] responds [應]; when he plucks a \"jue\" [string], [another] \"jue\" responds [動]. This is the harmony of notes that are the same. But if [he] tunes one string eccentrically, so that it does not accord with [any] of the five notes and then strikes it, and all twenty-five strings [of the \"se\"] respond [應], this is [a case of] the sounds not yet having begun to differentiate but the ruler of [all] notes having already achieved its form [音之君已形]. Thus one who penetrates to Supreme Harmony [太和] is as confused as [a person who] is stupified by drink, who wanders about in a sweet daze without knowing where he has come from or where he is going. Simple and mild, he [descends] the vortex; simple and stupified, he [reaches] his end. He is like one who has not yet begun to emerge from the Ancestor. This is called the Great Penetration [大通]. (6.4, tr. Major et al 2010: 220) \nLike the indiscernible \"sounds not yet having begun to differentiate\", the True Person \"who has not yet begun to emerge\" resounds harmoniously with all things. According to Le Blanc (1985: 97, 140), this story's meaning revolves around a distinction between \"relative resonance\" when notes of the same pitch, such as the strings of two zithers tuned to the \"gong\" note, cause each other to vibrate in unison, and \"total resonance\" when an untuned note causes all 25 strings of a zither to resound simultaneously. The phenomenon of relative resonance, which is based on Yin-Yang theory, is experimentally verifiable; but the hypothesis (or \"super-experiment\") of total resonance is not verifiable, and used as a simile pointing to a realm beyond Yin-Yang. Total resonance differs in kind, not in degree, from relative resonance. \"There is a difference of level. The author starts from a solid but meaningful empirical fact that displays resonance and, from there, analogizes to a metaphorical or metaphysical level where resonance is all-encompassing\" (Le Blanc 1985: 142).\n\nTo illustrate how categorically identical things mutually resonate and influence each other, the \"Huainanzi\" (3.2 and 6.2) uses \"sun and moon mirrors\" to exemplify things belonging to the yang and yin categories. The \"yángsuì\" 陽燧 \"burning-mirror (which concentrates sunlight to ignite tinder)\" is yang, round, and sun-like; the \"fāngzhū\" 方諸 \"moon-mirror (used to collect dew by condensation)\" is yin, square, and moon-like.\nThat things in their [various] categories [類] are mutually responsive [相應] is [something] dark, mysterious, deep, and subtle. Knowledge is not capable of assessing it; argument is not capable of explaining it. Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine turns clear and overflows [its vessels]; when silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the \"shang\" string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. Something has stimulated [感] them. When a picture is traced out with the ashes of reeds, the moon's halo has a [corresponding] gap. When the leviathan dies, comets appear. Something has moved them. Thus, when a sage occupies the throne, he embraces the Way and does not speak, and his nurturance reaches to the myriad people. But when ruler and ministers [harbor] distrust in their hearts, back-to-back arcs appear in the sky. The mutual responses [相應] of spirit \"qi\" [神氣] are subtle indeed! Thus, mountain clouds are like grassy hummocks; river clouds are like fish scales; dryland clouds are like smoky fire; cataract clouds are like billowing water. All resemble their forms and evoke responses [感] according to their class. The burning mirror takes fire from the sun; the square receptacle takes dew from the moon. Of [all the things] between Heaven and Earth, even a skilled astrologer cannot master all their techniques. [Even] a hand [that can hold] minutely tiny and indistinct things cannot grasp a beam of light. However, from what is within the palm of one's hand, one can trace [correlative] categories [類] to beyond the extreme end point [of the cosmos]. [Thus] that one can set up [these implements] and produce water and fire is [a function of] the mutually [responsive] movement [相動] of yin and yang of the same \"qi\". (6.2, tr. Major et al. 2010:216-217) \n\nAnother Chapter 6 passage illustrates how resonance is in harmony with the Dao, and admits that even someone with \"enlightened understanding\" cannot explain the mysterious forces of magnetism, optics, enzymes, and heliotropism. \nNow if one were to accept [that] fire can burn wood and use it to melt metal, that would [follow] the movement of the Way. But if one were to accept [that] lodestone can attract iron and use it to attract tile, that would certainly be difficult. Things certainly cannot be assessed according to their weight [alone]. Now, the burning mirror can draw fire [from the sun]; lodestone can draw iron; crabs spoil lacquer; and sunflowers incline to the sun – [but] even if one has enlightened understanding, it is not possible to [explain why] these things are so. Thus investigations by ear and eye are not adequate to discern the principles of things; discussions employing the mind and its conceptions are not adequate to distinguish true and false. Thus he who uses knowledge as the basis for government will have a hard time holding on to his state. Only he who penetrates to Supreme Harmony [太和] and who grasps the responses of the natural will be able to possess it [i.e., his state]. (6.3, tr. Major et al. 2010:219) \nThe obscure relation between crabs and lacquer refers to the Chinese medical treatment of urushiol-induced contact dermatitis with crushed shellfish, which supposedly prevents lacquer from drying properly. In Daoist cosmology, \"Taihe\" 太和 \"Great/Supreme Harmony\" is the beginning state before \"Hundun\" \"primordial chaos\".\n\nChapter six contrasts two pairs of mythological charioteers (the minimum crew of a Chinese chariot included a driver and an archer). Although Wang Liang 王良 and Zaofu 造父 were famously skillful equestrians, Qian Qie 鉗且 and Da Bing 大丙 controlled their horses through mutual resonance – a simile for how a sage ruler should be attuned to his people (Le Blanc 1985: 36). \nIn ancient times, when Wang Liang and Zaofu went driving, [as soon as] they mounted their chariots and took hold of the reins, the horses set themselves in order and wanted to work together. They obediently paced in step with one another; [whether] pulling hard or easing off, they were as one. Their hearts were in tune and their \"qi\" harmonious; their bodies [became] more and more light and coordinated. They were content to work hard and happy to go forward; they galloped away as if they would vanish. They went right and left like [the waving of] a whip; they circled around like a jade bracelet. All people of that era considered [Wang Liang and Zaofu] to be superlative [charioteers], but that was because they had not yet seen any [truly] worthy ones. Now consider the charioteering of Qian Qie and Da Bing. They considered reins and bits superfluous, got rid of whips and cast aside goads. Before the chariot began to move, it was starting on its own. Before the horses were given the signal, they were walking on their own. They paced [like the] sun and moved [like the] moon. They flashed [like the] stars and advanced [like the] dark. They raced [like] lightning and leaped [like] ghosts. Advancing or withdrawing, gathering strength or stretching out, they did not see the slightest barrier. Thus, with no gesturing or pointing, with no cursing or scolding, they overtook the wild geese flying to Piled Stone Mountain, passed the jungle fowl [flying to] Guyu Mountain. Their galloping was like flying; their bursts of speed like thread snapping. [It was] like riding an arrow or mounting the wind, like following a cyclone and returning in an instant. At dawn they started from Fusang and set with the sun at Luotang. This was taking something unused and obtaining its usefulness: it was not done by examining things through reason or thought or through the exercise of manual skill. Whenever urgent desires took form in the breasts [of Qian Qie and Da Bing], their quintessential spirits were [already] communicated to the six horses. This was a case of using non-driving to go driving. (6.6, tr. Major et al. 2010: 222-223) \nThe \"Huainanzi\" developed the idea of politically-oriented \"ganying\" philosophy. The most perfect form of government is that of \"wuwei\" \"non-action\", for it operates through the \"ziran\" \"natural\" \"ganying\" \"resonance\" of all things. The perfect ruler is the \"zhenren\" True Person who, being one with Dao, is in a state of mutual resonance with all things (Le Blanc 1985: 192). \"What I call non-action [means] ... the undertakings of government will succeed, but [you] personally will not be glorified. [Your] accomplishments will be established, but your reputation will not obtain. [Non-action] does not mean that a stimulus [感] will not produce a response [應] or that a push will not move [something].\" (19.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 770-771). The Daoist idea of \"wuwei\" is interpreted formally in the sense of \"ganying\", \"non-interference means to respond spontaneously and harmoniously to stimulus\" (Le Blanc 1985: 37).\n\nIn conclusion, \"Huainanzi\" scholars delineate the meaning of \"ganying\".\n\"Kan-ying\" may be defined, in the final analysis, as the power of things to affect and to be affected in such a way as to bring about harmony. This power is based on the persistent affinity and attraction of things that were originally one, but that became scattered when the world began. Through the True Man \"kan-ying\" recreates the original unity. As a dynamic pattern \"kan-ying\" expresses the full cycle of cosmological, social and psychological integration. Its natural and universal character makes it binding for the cosmos as a whole and also for each and every one of the Ten Thousand Things issuing from Tao. In Chapter Six the foregoing pattern is applied mainly to the realm of human society and, more specifically, to the relations between the perfect ruler – the True Man - and the people. The argument there propounded, that these relations should be based on non-action (\"wu-wei\") understood as resonance (\"kan-ying\"), draws its ultimate strength from the cosmological scheme outlined above. We may thus conclude that \"kan-ying\" not only forms a logically coherent and philosophically meaningful idea but also provides the focal point around which the \"Huai-nan Tzu\" cosmology is structured. (Le Blanc 1985: 209) \n\"Resonance\" is a central operative principle of the cosmos as conceived by the \"Huainanzi\". The phrase itself means \"stimulus\" (\"gan\" 感) and \"response\" (\"ying\" 應), which is how we have translated it when the \"Huainanzi\" refers specifically to the discrete component processes that the term denotes. Fundamentally, \"resonance\" is a process of dynamic interaction that transcends the limits of time, space, and ordinary linear causality. Through the mechanism of resonance, an event in one location (the \"stimulus\") produces simultaneous effects in another location (the \"response\"), even though the two phenomena have no direct spatial or mechanical contact. They may indeed be separated by vast gulfs of space. For example, connections between celestial events (eclipses, planetary motions) and events in the human community were understood as examples of \"resonance.\" For the authors of the \"Huainanzi\", such connections were not coincidence or mere correspondence but dynamic influences exchanged through the energetic medium of \"qi\". All phenomena are both composed of and impelled by \"qi\", and since all currently differentiated \"qi\" emerged from an originally undifferentiated Grand One, all \"qi\" remains mutually resonantly linked. The pathways of resonance are not random, however. Objects are most sensitive to resonant influences emanating from other objects that share the same constituent form of \"qi\". (Major et al. 2010: 875) \n\nWang Chong's (c. 80 CE) \"Lunheng\" \"Discourse Balance\" uses \"ganying\" once to criticize prognostications from the \"Fengjia\" 風家 \"School of Wind\".\nIn regard to the Six Passions [六情: cheerfulness, anger, grief, joy, love, and hatred] the expositors of the wind theory maintain that, when the wind blows, robbers and thieves set to work under its influence [感應], but the nature of robbers and thieves cannot move Heaven to send the wind. When the wind blows, it has a strange influence on perverted minds so, that robbers and thieves do their deeds. How can we prove that? Robbers and thieves seeing something, take it away, and beholding an enemy, kill him. This is an off-hand business, and the work of a moment, and not premeditated day and night. When the heavenly afflatus passes, the time of greedy scoundrels and stealthy thieves has come. (43, tr. Forke 1907 1: 62)\n\nWang Chong first used the word \"ganlei\" 感類 as a chapter title \"Sympathetic Emotions\" (tr. Forke), and later Chinese literature often used \"ganlei\" \"sympathy between things of like kind\" to describe sympathetic resonance among things of the same category (Sharf 2002: 85). \nWhen the \"Yin\" and the \"Yang\" are at variance, calamitous changes supervene. Either they arise from the unexpiated guilt of former generations, or it is the spontaneous action of the fluids. Worthies and sages feel an emotion by sympathy [感類], and, in their agitation, think out for themselves the reason for the calamity, implying some wickedness, having happened. They incriminate themselves, and from fear that they themselves are culpable take every precaution. (55, tr. Forke 1907 2: 16) \nAccording to Forke, \"Sages have many affinities with Heaven which manifests itself by them. Therefore Heaven being agitated, they are agitated too.\"\n\nYing Shao's (c. 195 CE) \"Fengsu Tongyi\" uses \"ganying\" twice. The first usage is in a narrative about Crown Prince Dan from the state of Yan (d. 226 BCE) and the future Emperor Qin Shi Huang when he was King of the state of Qin. After Dan escaped from being held hostage by Qin, he sent Jing Ke to assassinate the King, but Heaven miraculously used \"ganying\" to save him from death. The second quotes the \"Shujing\" \"Canon of Shun\" (tr. Legge), Emperor Shun appointed Kui to be Minister of Music, and Kui said, \"I smite the (sounding-) stone, I gently strike it, and the various animals lead on one another to dance\"; and asks, \"if the various animals resonated, (quoting the \"Yijing\") 'How much more must it be so with (the operations of) men! How much more also with the spiritual agency!'.\"\n\nPost-Han Daoism expanded the notion of \"ganying\" far beyond the basic \"Huainanzi\" (above) ideas that historical events result from mutual resonance between different parts of the universe, and that human beings are agents of mutual resonance who participate fully in the creative transformations of Dao (Le Blanc 1985: 110).\n\n\"Chongxuan\" 重玄 \"Twofold Mystery\" Daoism emphasized the phenomena of sympathetic resonance. The \"Daodejing\" commentary of Cheng Xuanying 成玄英 (fl. 631-650), an important Twofold Mystery author, differentiated between two kinds of response: \"tongying\" 通應 \"universal response\" and \"bieying\" 别應 \"differential response\". Universal response is that of heaven, which responds out of compassion to all without distinction; differential response, is geared to \"biekan\" 别感 \"specific stimuli\", such as when Laozi gave the \"Daodejing\" to Yinxi (Sharf 2002: 96) .\n\nThe (7th century) Buddhist-influenced text \"Daojiao yishu\" 道教義樞 \"Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings\" has a section titled \"Ganying yi\" 感應義 \"The Meaning of Stimulus Response\", which depicts the sage as one who spontaneously and appropriately \"ganying\" responds to stimuli, and enumerates six categories of stimulus and six of response. The six categories of stimulus are grouped into three pairs: \"principal\" (正) and \"proximate\" (附), whether the stimulus is initiated by a self-aware mind or an insentient object, \"universal\" (普) and specific \"preferential\" (偏), and \"manifest\" (顯) and \"hidden\" (陰) stimuli. The six categories of response are: through \"pneuma\" (氣), specifically the \"primal pneuma\" (元氣), a response through \"forms\" (形), response through \"language\" (文), \"sages\" (聖), \"worthies\" (賢), and \"transmitted\" response (袭). Furthermore, the \"Daojiao yishu\" distinguishes four categories of \"ganying\" according to whether the agent and recipient of the stimulus are sentient or insentient, for example, the bell sounding at the collapse of the bronze mountain is in the third category of an insentient object stimulating a response in an insentient object (Sharf 2002: 96-97).\n\nSince Chinese philosophers and authors invoked the principle of \"ganying\" to explain topics such as seasonal and astronomical cycles, celestial portents, moral retribution, and political upheaval, it is to be expected that the principle would similarly influence the Chinese understanding of Buddhist cosmology, philosophy, and monastic practice (Sharf 2002: 97). As an example of how the Chinese notion of sympathetic resonance was both powerful enough and malleable enough to lend itself to a variety of Buddhist hermeneutical tasks, Sharf says Guifeng Zongmi employed it in his account of Chan patriarchal succession: \nBodhidharma came from the west only in order to transmit the mind dharma. Thus he himself said: \"My dharma is transmitted from mind to mind and does not depend on words or letters.\" This mind is the pure and original awakening of all sentient beings. It is also known as buddha-nature or numinous awakening 靈覺 ... If you wish to see the Way of the Buddhas, you must awaken to this mind. Therefore, the generations of patriarchs in this lineage transmit only this. If there is a sympathetic resonance and reciprocal tallying [between master and disciple] 感應相契, then although a single flame may be transmitted to a hundred thousand lamps, there will be no difference between them. (2002: 131-132) \n\nAlthough the Chinese word \"ganying\" 感應 was not employed in translating any specific Sanskrit term, it frequently occurs in Chinese Buddhist discussions elucidating the workings of ritual invocation and \"jiachi\" 加持 \"empowerment; assistance\" (adhiṣṭhāna). \"Ganying\" is the principle underlying the interaction between practitioner and Buddha, the supplicant is said to \"gan\" \"stimulate; affect\" the Buddha, which elicits the Buddha's compassionate \"ying\" \"response\". For example, the expressions \"ganfo\" 感佛 \"affect the Buddha\" or \"gan rulai\" 感如來 \"stimulate the tathagata\" (Sharf 2002: 120). The Buddhist monk Lokaksema's (179 CE) Chinese \"Banzhou sanmei jing\" 般舟三昧經 translation of the \"Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra\" uses the indigenous notion of \"ganying\" \"sympathetic resonance\" to explain the interaction between the practitioner or supplicant and the grace of buddha or bodhisattva being invoked (Sharf 2002: 119).\n\nHuiyuan (332-416), the first patriarch of the Pure Land School of Buddhism, used a legend about a bronze bell resonating at the collapse of a distant bronze mountain as an explanation of \"ganying\" for the scholar Yin Zhongkan 殷仲堪 (d. 399). The (early 5th century) \"Shishuo Xinyu\" \"A New Account of the Tales of the World\" says,\nYin Chung-k'an once asked the monk Hui-yuan, \"What is the substance of the \"Book of Changes\"?\" Hui-yuan replied, \"Stimulus-response [\"gan\" 感] is the substance of the \"Changes\".\" Yin continued, \"When the bronze mountain collapsed in the west and the magic bell responded [\"ying\" 應] in the east, was \"that\" the \"Book of changes\"?\" Hui-yuan smiled without answering. (tr. Mather 1976:123\nThe (5th century) \"Hou Hanshu\" biography of Fan Ying 樊英 (tr. Sharf 2006: 82) likewise records that during the reign of Emperor Shun of Han (r. 126-144 CE), there was a disaster at the Min Mountains in Shu (modern Sichuan). \"A bell below the emperor's hall sounded of itself. Fan Ying explained: 'Min Mountain in Shu (Szechwan) has collapsed. Mountains are mothers in relation to bronze. When the mother collapses, the child cries. In due time Shu reported that indeed a mountain had collapsed, and the time of the collapse matched precisely the time the bell had sounded.\" Sharf explains \"ganying\" resonance as the mechanism through which categorically related but spatially distant phenomena interact, as a mode of seemingly spontaneous response (although not in the sense of \"uncaused\") natural in a holistic universe of pattern and interdependent order.\n\nSengyou's \"Chu sanzang jiji\" 出三藏記集 preserves a statement by Zhi Dun (314-366).\nThe principle is different from [the world of] change, and change is different from principle. The teachings are different from the essence [of wisdom, the inner mind of the sage], and the essence is different from the teachings. Therefore, the thousand changes and myriad transformations all take place outside the [realm of] principle, for how could there be any movement in the spirit [of the sage]? Precisely because it does not move, it can endlessly respond to change. The endless change does not denote the presence of the sage in things, nor is the change of things itself the sage. The myriad sounds cause the bell to reverberate—a reverberation that, although single, encompasses [all the myriad sounds]. A myriad things stimulate 感 the sage, and the sage also responds 應 out of stillness. Therefore, the [myriad] sounds are not the same as the [single] reverberation, and the words [of the teachings] are not the same as the wisdom of the sage. (tr. Sharf 2002: 112-113) \n\nScholars in the \"Chengshi zong\" 成實宗 or Tattvasiddhi School were engaged in a controversy over the nature of stimulus-response. For example, the \"Dasheng Xuanlun\" 大乘玄論 \"Treatise on the Mystery of the Mahāyāna\" by Zhizang 智藏 (458-522) explains \"ganying\",\nStimulus-response is the great tenet of the buddha-dharma, the essential teaching of the many sutras. To \"stimulate\" means to bring or summon forth, and to \"respond\" means to go forth and meet in welcome. As all sentient beings possess [the seeds of] goodness, they may induce the Buddhas to descend and take shape in front of them, and [the Buddhas] will meet them in welcome. The principle [is such that they] neither deviate nor overshoot [the mark]. This is called stimulus and response. The common person stimulates but does not respond; the Buddhas respond but do not stimulate; and bodhisattvas both respond and stimulate. (tr. Sharf 2002: 121-122) \n\nBuddhist scholars in the Tiantai School further developed the doctrine of \"ganying\". Zhiyi (538–597) analyzed the \"Lotus Sutra\" in terms of thirty \"miao\" 妙 \"wonders\", coming from the sutra's Chinese title of \"Miaofa lieahua jing\" 妙法蓮花經 \"Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Wondrous Dharma\", including the \"ganying miao\" 感應妙 \"wonder of stimulus-response\" (Sharf 2002: 124). \n\nAccording to the Mahayana Buddhist doctrine of Trikāya (translated as \"sanshen\" 三身) \"three bodies\", a single Buddha has three coexisting buddha-bodies: the \"dharmakāya\" (\"fashen\" 法身) \"truth body\" that is identical with transcendent reality and realization of true enlightenment, \"sambhogakāya\" (\"baoshen\" 報身) \"delight/reward body\" for the enjoyment of the merits attained as a bodhisattva, and \"nirmāṇakāya\" (\"yingshen\" 應身) \"response body\" manifested in response to the need to save all sentient beings. In addition to Chinese \"yingshen\" 應身 \"response body; resonant body\", some schools translate Sanskrit \"nirmāṇakāya\" as \"huashen\" 化身 \"transformation body\" or \"huayingshen\" 化應身 \"transformation response body\".\n\nDifferent Chinese Buddhist schools and texts give sometimes conflicting interpretations of \"yingshen\" and \"huashen\". The Northern Wei (386-534) dynasty \"She dasheng lun\" 攝大乘論 translation of the \"Mahāyāna-samgraha\" directly uses \"yingshen\" to translate \"nirmāṇakāya\" (Sharf 2002: 103). The \"Jinguang mingjing\" 金光明經 \"Golden Light Sutra\" (\"Suvarṇaprabhāsa Sūtra\") distinguishes the \"huashen\" \"transformation body\" (\"nirmāṇakāya\") that can be seen by all beings in whatever form best suits their needs from the \"yingshen\" \"resonant body\" (functionally the \"saṃbhogakāya\"), possessing the 32 major signs and 80 minor marks of a Buddha, that is only manifest to buddhas and bodhisattvas (Sharf 2002: 104-105). The \"Dasheng qixin lun\" 大乘起信論 or \"Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana\" makes no distinction between the two, with the \"yingshen\" \"response body\" being the Buddha of the 32 signs who revealed himself to the earthly disciples.\n\nSharf (2002: 111-112) explains that the Chinese understanding of \"yingshen\" \"resonant/response [buddha-]body\" incorporates the Buddhist notion of \"nirmāṇakāya\" a corporeal (or seemingly corporeal) body manifest in response to the needs of suffering beings and the Chinese cosmological principles that explain the power to produce such bodies in terms of \"wuwei\" nonaction and \"ganying\" sympathetic resonance. \"The sage, bodhisattva, or buddha, through the principle of nonaction, becomes at one with the universe, acquires the attributes of stillness and harmonious balance, and, without any premeditation or will of his own, spontaneously responds to the stimuli of the world around him, manifesting bodies wherever and whenever the need arises.\"\n\nParalleling the use of \"ganying\" 感應 in Chinese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhism borrowed the Sino-Japanese loanword \"kannō\" 感應. For example, Kannō-ji is a Buddhist temple on Mount Kabutoyama in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo.\n\nDuring the Song dynasty (960-1276), the cosmological writings of the Neo-Confucianists, escpecially the Cheng-Zhu school, gave \"ganying\" its \"perfect expression\" (Le Blanc 1985: 9).\n\nThe British sinologist Angus Charles Graham says the Chinese \"correlative cosmology\" concepts of \"gan\" and \"ying\" occupy the same place in Song philosophy as causation in the West.\nIf it is assumed that things consist of inert matter, it is natural to think in terms of \"effect\" which passively allow themselves to be pushed by \"causes\". But if inert matter is only the essentially active ether \"ch'i\" in an impure state, this kind of action will only be of minor importance; in the purer ether, when A acts on B, B will not only be moved by it, but will respond actively. (1958: 38) \n\nNoting that Chinese \"ganying\" has no exact English equivalent, the Philippine scholar in Chinese philosophy Antonio Cua (1975: 2) translates it as \"influence and response\" or \"responding to influence\", and proposes a Neo-Confucian conception of the world in which natural events or states of affairs are viewed as an open set of influences that call for some sort of human responses or actions. This conception of a practical rather than a theoretical causation is a model or \"an imaginative schema for guiding actions toward the Confucian vision of central harmony\".\n\nThe \"Jishanji\" 霽山集 \"Clear Mountain Collection\" by the Song author Lin Jingxi 林景熙 (1242-1310) praised psychological resonance.\nScholars of old time said that the mind is originally empty, and only because of this can it respond to natural things [\"yingwu\" 應物] without prejudices (lit. traces, [\"ji\" 迹]) left behind to influence later vision). Only the empty mind [\"xuxin\" 虚心] can respond to the things of Nature. Though everything resonates with the mind, the mind should be as if it had never resonated, and things should not remain in it. But once the mind has received (impressions of) natural things, they tend to remain and not to disappear, thus leaving traces in the mind. (These affect later seeing and thinking, so that the mind is not truly 'empty' and unbiased.) It should be like a river gorge with swans flying overhead; the river has no desire to retain the swan, yet the swan's passage is traced out by its shadow without any omission. (tr. Needham 1956: 89) \n\nNot only was the notion of \"ganying\" resonance situated in the cultural domains of Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, but also in Chinese folk religion, with a meaning of \"divine retribution; moral retribution\". The related term \"baoying\" 报應 \"moral retribution\" originated from Buddhist doctrines of karma and reincarnation, and became a fundamental principle of Chinese popular religious belief and practice.\n\n\"Ganying\" \"moral retribution\" was central to the genre of popular religious texts known as \"shànshū\" 善書 (lit. \"good book\") \"moral-instruction book; moral tract\". It specifically referred to the principle of \"tit-for-tat moral retribution\", based upon the belief that one's good and evil deeds will result in corresponding rewards and punishments, typically manifest as the lengthening or shortening of one's life (Sharf 2002: 93-94).\n\nThe (c. 12th century) anonymous Song dynasty compilation \"Taishang ganying pian\" 太上感應篇 \"Folios of the Most High on Retribution\" was the classic in the \"shanshu\" genre, and one of the most widely circulated Daoist works in late imperial China (Sharf 2002: 95). \"The Impious Magistrate\" story exemplifies \"Taishang ganying pian\" content.\nWang An-shih, a high magistrate of the Sung dynasty (960-1278 A.D.), was a learned scholar but recklessly irreverent, and so introduced, radical innovations in his administration. People complained, officers demurred, and the emperor expressed surprise; but he would say, \"Heavenly omens should not be heeded, human discontent need not be minded, and there is no sense in following the ancestral laws.\" He and his son, who assisted him in his office, even attempted to revive the ancient cruel custom of corporal punishment; but before the law was passed, the son died, and Wang An-shih built a Buddhist temple on the site of his son's residence. While the magistrate was performing the customary Buddhist rite, he thought he faintly perceived in the flame of a burning candle the image of his son, bound hand and foot in a cangue, crying: \"Our attempt to revive corporal mutilation angered Heaven, and I have no chance of getting out of this infernal torture.\" Later An-shih fell in disgrace; he lost his position and died miserably in exile. Now it happened that soon afterwards, one of An-shih's relatives was taken ill, and swooned, and when he recovered, he said that he had been ushered into a special department in hell, where hung the sign: \"Wickedness and Crime Eternally Prohibited,\" and there lie saw a noble-looking man in a cangue, who had gray hair and large eyes. Though he did not mention the name of this unfortunate person, everyone around knew that it was Wang An-shih of whom he spoke. When An-shih's daughter inquired what could be done, the sick man simply said: \"All that is necessary is to accumulate merits and nothing more.\" (tr. Suzuki and Carus 1906: 96-97) \nThe Chinese cangue was a portable pillory used for torture and corporal punishment.\n\nBeginning with the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the Chinese language borrowed many scientific terms as loanwords from Western languages.\n\nExamples of \"gǎnyìng\" scientifically meaning \"cause-effect; stimulus-response\" include.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56357788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56357788", "title": "Gertrude C. Bussey", "text": "Gertrude C. Bussey\n\nGertrude Carman Bussey (13 January 1888 - 12 March 1961) was an American academic philosopher and activist for women's rights, civil liberties, and peace\nGertrude Bussey first attended Barnard College before graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1908 from Wellesley College. After graduate study at Columbia University in 1908-1909 and teaching at a private school in Bronxville she went on to do further study at Oxford University during 1912-14. She then went to Northwestern University and became, in 1915, its first student to receive a PhD in philosophy. In the same year Dr. Bussey was appointed as an instructor of philosophy at Goucher College. She was promoted to full professor in 1921, and became chair of the philosophy department in 1924, a position she held until her retirement in 1953. In 1954 she received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (LHD) from the college.\n\nIn 1912 the Open Court Publishing Company produced a French/English version of \"Man a Machine\" by Julien Offray de La Mettrie that was founded on Bussey's translation (revised by Mary Whiton Calkins with the help of M. Carret and George Santayana) and included historical and philosophical notes that were condensed and adapted from a thesis on La Mettrie presented by Bussey to Wellesley College. It was reprinted in 1927 and 1943. This was the only available English translation of La Mettrie made since 1750 and no newer English translation was made available until 1994. Her PHd dissertation \"\"Typical Recent Conceptions of Freedom\",\" of which several chapters were previously published in \"The Philosophical Review\" and \"The Monist,\" was published in 1917 and was republished in 1990. In the same she discusses various then contemporary naturalistic conceptions of freedom and determinism related to the issue of free will including those of Ernst Haeckel, William James, Henri Bergson and Charles Bosanquet. Bussey's later articles were concerned with religion.\n\nDr Bussey \"demonstrated throughout her life a concern for economic and social justice, peace, and above all, freedom\" and was involved with numerous progressive social and political causes. She was, along with Elisabeth Gilman, a co-founder and leader of the Maryland Civil Liberties Committee, which was formed in 1921 in the wake of arrests and deportations of immigrant workers and was later to become a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union She was also involved with the Baltimore Open Forum, the Consumers' League of Maryland, the Baltimore YMCA, and the Church League for Industrial Democracy.\n\nBussey was however \"most completely identified with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom\" (WILPF). She was an original member of WILPF's Baltimore branch and was to serve as its Chairperson. On behalf of WILPF she traveled the Midwest giving lectures about the link between education and war and peace. At a 1935 lecture in Hagerstown, Maryland, Bussey declared \"We must strive to solve the economic and political problems which drive modern countries into war,\" and that \"the world is now engaged in a race between education and death,\" clarifying, as Mitchel K. Hal, put it \"that the solution to war was education and that permanent peace could only be achieved when people had the proper knowledge to see alternatives to war\". \n\nOn the 30th of September 1936 Bussey was a member of a WILPF delegation that discussed peace issues with President Roosevelt at the White House. Bussey served as National President of WILPF from May 1939 but, uncertain she could maintain the pacifist stance she felt the position required she resigned the leadership in May 1941. She did however remain active within WILPF and went on to serve as Honorary National President from 1960 to 1961.\n\nBussey died before she could complete her projected 50-year history on the WILPF, it was however completed by Margaret Tims and published posthumously as \"'Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, 1915-1965: A Record of Fifty Years Work\"' (1965).

{"id": "12963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12963", "title": "Giordano Bruno", "text": "Giordano Bruno\n\nGiordano Bruno (; ; ; born Filippo Bruno, 1548 – 17 February 1600) was an Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, poet, and cosmological theorist. He is known for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended the then-novel Copernican model. He proposed that the stars were distant suns surrounded by their own planets, and he raised the possibility that these planets might foster life of their own, a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism. He also insisted that the universe is infinite and could have no \"center\".\n\nStarting in 1593, Bruno was tried for heresy by the Roman Inquisition on charges of denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including eternal damnation, the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the virginity of Mary, and transubstantiation. Bruno's pantheism was also a matter of grave concern, as was his teaching of the transmigration of the soul. The Inquisition found him guilty, and he was burned at the stake in Rome's Campo de' Fiori in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science, although historians have debated the extent to which his heresy trial was a response to his astronomical views or to other aspects of his philosophy and theology.\nBruno's case is still considered a landmark in the history of free thought and the emerging sciences.\n\nIn addition to cosmology, Bruno also wrote extensively on the art of memory, a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles. Historian Frances Yates argues that Bruno was deeply influenced by Arab astrology (particularly the philosophy of Averroes), Neoplatonism, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Genesis-like legends surrounding the Egyptian god Thoth. Other studies of Bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.\n\nBorn Filippo Bruno in Nola (in Campania, then part of the Kingdom of Naples) in 1548, he was the son of Giovanni Bruno, a soldier, and Fraulissa Savolino. In his youth he was sent to Naples to be educated. He was tutored privately at the Augustinian monastery there, and attended public lectures at the Studium Generale. At the age of 17, he entered the Dominican Order at the monastery of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, taking the name Giordano, after Giordano Crispo, his metaphysics tutor. He continued his studies there, completing his novitiate, and became an ordained priest in 1572 at age 24. During his time in Naples he became known for his skill with the art of memory and on one occasion traveled to Rome to demonstrate his mnemonic system before Pope Pius V and Cardinal Rebiba. In his later years Bruno claimed that the Pope accepted his dedication to him of the lost work \"On The Ark of Noah\" at this time.\n\nWhile Bruno was distinguished for outstanding ability, his taste for free thinking and forbidden books soon caused him difficulties. Given the controversy he caused in later life it is surprising that he was able to remain within the monastic system for eleven years. In his testimony to Venetian inquisitors during his trial, many years later, he says that proceedings were twice taken against him for having cast away images of the saints, retaining only a crucifix, and for having recommended controversial texts to a novice. Such behavior could perhaps be overlooked, but Bruno's situation became much more serious when he was reported to have defended the Arian heresy, and when a copy of the banned writings of Erasmus, annotated by him, was discovered hidden in the convent privy. When he learned that an indictment was being prepared against him in Naples he fled, shedding his religious habit, at least for a time.\n\nBruno first went to the Genoese port of Noli, then to Savona, Turin and finally to Venice, where he published his lost work \"On the Signs of the Times\" with the permission (so he claimed at his trial) of the Dominican Remigio Nannini Fiorentino. From Venice he went to Padua, where he met fellow Dominicans who convinced him to wear his religious habit again. From Padua he went to Bergamo and then across the Alps to Chambéry and Lyon. His movements after this time are obscure.\n\nIn 1579 he arrived in Geneva. As D.W. Singer, a Bruno biographer, notes, \"The question has sometimes been raised as to whether Bruno became a Protestant, but it is intrinsically most unlikely that he accepted membership in Calvin's communion\" During his Venetian trial he told inquisitors that while in Geneva he told the Marchese de Vico of Naples, who was notable for helping Italian refugees in Geneva, \"I did not intend to adopt the religion of the city. I desired to stay there only that I might live at liberty and in security.\" Bruno had a pair of breeches made for himself, and the Marchese and others apparently made Bruno a gift of a sword, hat, cape and other necessities for dressing himself; in such clothing Bruno could no longer be recognized as a priest. Things apparently went well for Bruno for a time, as he entered his name in the Rector's Book of the University of Geneva in May 1579. But in keeping with his personality he could not long remain silent. In August he published an attack on the work of Antoine de la Faye, a distinguished professor. He and the printer were promptly arrested. Rather than apologizing, Bruno insisted on continuing to defend his publication. He was refused the right to take sacrament. Though this right was eventually restored, he left Geneva.\n\nHe went to France, arriving first in Lyon, and thereafter settling for a time (1580–1581) in Toulouse, where he took his doctorate in theology and was elected by students to lecture in philosophy. It seems he also attempted at this time to return to Catholicism, but was denied absolution by the Jesuit priest he approached. When religious strife broke out in the summer of 1581, he moved to Paris. There he held a cycle of thirty lectures on theological topics and also began to gain fame for his prodigious memory. Bruno's feats of memory were based, at least in part, on his elaborate system of mnemonics, but some of his contemporaries found it easier to attribute them to magical powers. His talents attracted the benevolent attention of the king Henry III. The king summoned him to the court. Bruno subsequently reported \"I got me such a name that King Henry III summoned me one day to discover from me if the memory which I possessed was natural or acquired by magic art. I satisfied him that it did not come from sorcery but from organised knowledge; and, following this, I got a book on memory printed, entitled \"The Shadows of Ideas\", which I dedicated to His Majesty. Forthwith he gave me an Extraordinary Lectureship with a salary.\"\n\nIn Paris Bruno enjoyed the protection of his powerful French patrons. During this period, he published several works on mnemonics, including \"De umbris idearum\" (\"On the Shadows of Ideas\", 1582), \"Ars Memoriae\" (\"The Art of Memory\", 1582), and \"Cantus Circaeus\" (\"Circe's Song\", 1582). All of these were based on his mnemonic models of organised knowledge and experience, as opposed to the simplistic logic-based mnemonic techniques of Petrus Ramus then becoming popular. Bruno also published a comedy summarizing some of his philosophical positions, titled \"Il Candelaio\" (\"The Torchbearer\", 1582). In the 16th century dedications were, as a rule, approved beforehand, and hence were a way of placing a work under the protection of an individual. Given that Bruno dedicated various works to the likes of King Henry III, Sir Philip Sidney, Michel de Castelnau (French Ambassador to England), and possibly Pope Pius V, it is apparent that this wanderer had risen sharply in status and moved in powerful circles.\n\nIn April 1583, Bruno went to England with letters of recommendation from Henry III as a guest of the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau. There he became acquainted with the poet Philip Sidney (to whom he dedicated two books) and other members of the Hermetic circle around John Dee, though there is no evidence that Bruno ever met Dee himself. He also lectured at Oxford, and unsuccessfully sought a teaching position there. His views were controversial, notably with John Underhill, Rector of Lincoln College and subsequently bishop of Oxford, and George Abbot, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. Abbot mocked Bruno for supporting \"the opinion of Copernicus that the did go round, and the heavens did stand still; whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round, and his brains did not stand still\", and reports accusations that Bruno plagiarized Ficino's work.\n\nNevertheless, his stay in England was fruitful. During that time Bruno completed and published some of his most important works, the six \"Italian Dialogues,\" including the cosmological tracts \"La Cena de le Ceneri\" (\"The Ash Wednesday Supper\", 1584), \"De la Causa, Principio et Uno\" (\"On Cause, Principle and Unity\", 1584), \"De l'Infinito, Universo e Mondi\" (\"On the Infinite, Universe and Worlds\", 1584) as well as \"Lo Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante\" (\"The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast\", 1584) and \"De gl' Heroici Furori\" (\"On the Heroic Frenzies\", 1585). Some of these were printed by John Charlewood. Some of the works that Bruno published in London, notably \"The Ash Wednesday Supper\", appear to have given offense. Once again, Bruno's controversial views and tactless language lost him the support of his friends. John Bossy has advanced the theory that, while staying in the French Embassy in London, Bruno was also spying on Catholic conspirators, under the pseudonym \"Henry Fagot', for Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State.\n\nBruno is sometimes cited as being the first to propose that the universe is infinite, which he did during his time in England, but an English scientist, Thomas Digges, put forth this idea in a published work in 1576, some eight years earlier than Bruno.\n\nIn October 1585, after the French embassy in London was attacked by a mob, Bruno returned to Paris with Castelnau, finding a tense political situation. Moreover, his 120 theses against Aristotelian natural science and his pamphlets against the mathematician Fabrizio Mordente soon put him in ill favor. In 1586, following a violent quarrel about Mordente's invention, the differential compass, he left France for (Germany).\n\nIn Germany he failed to obtain a teaching position at Marburg, but was granted permission to teach at Wittenberg, where he lectured on Aristotle for two years. However, with a change of intellectual climate there, he was no longer welcome, and went in 1588 to Prague, where he obtained 300 taler from Rudolf II, but no teaching position. He went on to serve briefly as a professor in Helmstedt, but had to flee again when he was excommunicated by the Lutherans.\n\nDuring this period he produced several Latin works, dictated to his friend and secretary Girolamo Besler, including \"De Magia\" (\"On Magic\"), \"Theses De Magia\" (\"Theses on Magic\") and \"De Vinculis in Genere\" (\"A General Account of Bonding\"). All these were apparently transcribed or recorded by Besler (or Bisler) between 1589 and 1590. He also published \"De Imaginum, Signorum, Et Idearum Compositione\" (\"On the Composition of Images, Signs and Ideas\", 1591).\n\nIn 1591 he was in Frankfurt. Apparently, during the Frankfurt Book Fair, he received an invitation to Venice from the patrician Giovanni Mocenigo, who wished to be instructed in the art of memory, and also heard of a vacant chair in mathematics at the University of Padua. At the time the Inquisition seemed to be losing some of its strictness, and because Venice was the most liberal state in Italy, Bruno was lulled into making the fatal mistake of returning to Italy.\n\nHe went first to Padua, where he taught briefly, and applied unsuccessfully for the chair of mathematics, which was given instead to Galileo Galilei one year later. Bruno accepted Mocenigo's invitation and moved to Venice in March 1592. For about two months he served as an in-house tutor to Mocenigo. When Bruno announced his plan to leave Venice to his host, the latter, who was unhappy with the teachings he had received and had apparently come to dislike Bruno, denounced him to the Venetian Inquisition, which had Bruno arrested on 22 May 1592. Among the numerous charges of blasphemy and heresy brought against him in Venice, based on Mocenigo's denunciation, was his belief in the plurality of worlds, as well as accusations of personal misconduct. Bruno defended himself skillfully, stressing the philosophical character of some of his positions, denying others and admitting that he had had doubts on some matters of dogma. The Roman Inquisition, however, asked for his transfer to Rome. After several months of argument, the Venetian authorities reluctantly consented and Bruno was sent to Rome in February 1593.\n\nDuring the seven years of his trial in Rome, Bruno was held in confinement, lastly in the Tower of Nona. Some important documents about the trial are lost, but others have been preserved, among them a summary of the proceedings that was rediscovered in 1940. The numerous charges against Bruno, based on some of his books as well as on witness accounts, included blasphemy, immoral conduct, and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology, and involved some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology. Luigi Firpo speculates the charges made against Bruno by the Roman Inquisition were:\n\nBruno defended himself as he had in Venice, insisting that he accepted the Church's dogmatic teachings, but trying to preserve the basis of his philosophy. In particular, he held firm to his belief in the plurality of worlds, although he was admonished to abandon it. His trial was overseen by the Inquisitor Cardinal Bellarmine, who demanded a full recantation, which Bruno eventually refused. On 20 January 1600, Pope Clement VIII declared Bruno a heretic and the Inquisition issued a sentence of death. According to the correspondence of Gaspar Schopp of Breslau, he is said to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have replied: \"Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiam\" (\"Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it\").\n\nHe was turned over to the secular authorities. On Ash Wednesday, 17 February 1600, in the Campo de' Fiori (a central Roman market square), with his \"tongue imprisoned because of his wicked words\". He was hung upside down naked before he was finally burned at the stake. His ashes were thrown into the Tiber river. All of Bruno's works were placed on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" in 1603.\nThe inquisition cardinals who judged Giordano Bruno were Cardinal Bellarmino (Bellarmine), Cardinal Madruzzo (Madruzzi), Cardinal Camillo Borghese (later Pope Paul V), Domenico Cardinal Pinelli, Pompeio Cardinal Arrigoni, Cardinal Sfondrati, Pedro Cardinal De Deza Manuel and Cardinal Santorio (Archbishop of Santa Severina, Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina).\n\nThe earliest likeness of Bruno is an engraving published in 1715 and cited by Salvestrini as \"the only known portrait of Bruno\". Salvestrini suggests that it is a re-engraving made from a now lost original. This engraving has provided the source for later images.\n\nThe records of Bruno's imprisonment by the Venetian inquisition in May 1592 describe him as a man \"of average height, with a hazel-coloured beard and the appearance of being about forty years of age\".\nAlternately, a passage in a work by George Abbot indicates that Bruno was of diminutive stature: \"When that Italian Didapper, who intituled himselfe Philotheus Iordanus Brunus Nolanus, magis elaboratae Theologiae Doctor, &c. with a name longer than his body...\". The word \"didapper\" used by Abbot is the derisive term which at the time meant \"a small diving waterfowl\".\n\nIn the first half of the 15th century, Nicholas of Cusa challenged the then widely accepted philosophies of Aristotelianism, envisioning instead an infinite universe whose center was everywhere and circumference nowhere, and moreover teeming with countless stars. He also predicted that neither were the rotational orbits circular nor were their movements uniform.\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, the theories of Copernicus (1473–1543) began diffusing through Europe. Copernicus conserved the idea of planets fixed to solid spheres, but considered the apparent motion of the stars to be an illusion caused by the rotation of the Earth on its axis; he also preserved the notion of an immobile center, but it was the Sun rather than the Earth. Copernicus also argued the Earth was a planet orbiting the Sun once every year. However he maintained the Ptolemaic hypothesis that the orbits of the planets were composed of perfect circles—deferents and epicycles—and that the stars were fixed on a stationary outer sphere.\n\nDespite the widespread publication of Copernicus' work \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\", during Bruno's time most educated Catholics subscribed to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the Earth was the center of the universe, and that all heavenly bodies revolved around it. The ultimate limit of the universe was the \"primum mobile\", whose diurnal rotation was conferred upon it by a transcendental God, not part of the universe (although, as the kingdom of heaven, adjacent to it), a motionless prime mover and first cause. The fixed stars were part of this celestial sphere, all at the same fixed distance from the immobile Earth at the center of the sphere. Ptolemy had numbered these at 1,022, grouped into 48 constellations. The planets were each fixed to a transparent sphere.\n\nFew astronomers of Bruno's time accepted Copernicus's heliocentric model. Among those who did were the Germans Michael Maestlin (1550–1631), Christoph Rothmann, Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), the Englishman Thomas Digges, author of \"A Perfit Description of the Caelestial Orbes,\" and the Italian Galileo Galilei (1564–1642).\n\nIn 1584, Bruno published two important philosophical dialogues (La Cena de le Ceneri and De l'infinito universo et mondi) in which he argued against the planetary spheres (Christoph Rothmann did the same in 1586 as did Tycho Brahe in 1587) and affirmed the Copernican principle.\n\nIn particular, to support the Copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of the Earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds, clouds etc., in La Cena de le Ceneri Bruno anticipates some of the arguments of Galilei on the relativity principle. Note that he also uses the example now known as Galileo's ship.\n\nTheophilus – [...] air through which the clouds and winds move are parts of the Earth, [...] to mean under the name of Earth the whole machinery and the entire animated part, which consists of dissimilar parts; so that the rivers, the rocks, the seas, the whole vaporous and turbulent air, which is enclosed within the highest mountains, should belong to the Earth as its members, just as the air [does] in the lungs and in other cavities of animals by which they breathe, widen their arteries, and other similar effects necessary for life are performed. The clouds, too, move through accidents in the body of the Earth and are in its bowels as are the waters. [...]\n\nWith the Earth move [...] all things that are on the Earth. If, therefore, from a point outside the Earth something were thrown upon the Earth, it would lose, because of the latter's motion, its straightness as would be seen on the ship [...] moving along a river, if someone on point C of the riverbank were to throw a stone along a straight line, and would see the stone miss its target by the amount of the velocity of the ship's motion. But if someone were placed high on the mast of that ship, move as it may however fast, he would not miss his target at all, so that the stone or some other heavy thing thrown downward would not come along a straight line from the point E which is at the top of the mast, or cage, to the point D which is at the bottom of the mast, or at some point in the bowels and body of the ship. Thus, if from the point D to the point E someone who is inside the ship would throw a stone straight up, it would return to the bottom along the same line however far the ship moved, provided it was not subject to any pitch and roll.\"\n\nBruno's infinite universe was filled with a substance—a \"pure air,\" aether, or \"spiritus\"—that offered no resistance to the heavenly bodies which, in Bruno's view, rather than being fixed, moved under their own impetus (momentum). Most dramatically, he completely abandoned the idea of a hierarchical universe.\n\nThe universe is then one, infinite, immobile... It is not capable of comprehension and therefore is endless and limitless, and to that extent infinite and indeterminable, and consequently immobile.\n\nBruno's cosmology distinguishes between \"suns\" which produce their own light and heat, and have other bodies moving around them; and \"earths\" which move around suns and receive light and heat from them. Bruno suggested that some, if not all, of the objects classically known as fixed stars are in fact suns. According to astrophysicist Steven Soter, he was the first person to grasp that \"stars are other suns with their own planets.\"\n\nBruno wrote that other worlds \"have no less virtue nor a nature different from that of our Earth\" and, like Earth, \"contain animals and inhabitants\".\n\nDuring the late 16th century, and throughout the 17th century, Bruno's ideas were held up for ridicule, debate, or inspiration. Margaret Cavendish, for example, wrote an entire series of poems against \"atoms\" and \"infinite worlds\" in \"Poems and Fancies\" in 1664. Bruno's true, if partial, vindication would have to wait for the implications and impact of Newtonian cosmology.\n\nBruno's overall contribution to the birth of modern science is still controversial. Some scholars follow Frances Yates stressing the importance of Bruno's ideas about the universe being infinite and lacking geocentric structure as a crucial crosspoint between the old and the new. Others see in Bruno's idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One, a forerunner of Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n\nWhile most academics note Bruno's theological position as pantheism, physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein in his \"Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis\" (\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\"), wrote that the theological model of pandeism was strongly expressed in the teachings of Bruno, especially with respect to the vision of a deity which had no particular relation to one part of the infinite universe more than any other, and was immanent, as present on Earth as in the Heavens, subsuming in itself the multiplicity of existence.\n\nThe Vatican has published few official statements about Bruno's trial and execution. In 1942, Cardinal Giovanni Mercati, who discovered a number of lost documents relating to Bruno's trial, stated that the Church was perfectly justified in condemning him. On the 400th anniversary of Bruno's death, in 2000, Cardinal Angelo Sodano declared Bruno's death to be a \"sad episode\" but, despite his regret, he defended Bruno's prosecutors, maintaining that the Inquisitors \"had the desire to serve freedom and promote the common good and did everything possible to save his life\". In the same year, Pope John Paul II made a general apology for \"the use of violence that some have committed in the service of truth\".\n\nSome authors have characterized Bruno as a \"martyr of science,\" suggesting parallels with the Galileo affair which began around 1610. They assert that, even though Bruno's theological beliefs, or perceptions of them by others, were an important factor in his heresy trial, his Copernicanism and cosmological beliefs played a significant role in the outcome.\n\n\"It should not be supposed\", writes A. M. Paterson of Bruno and his \"heliocentric solar system,\" that he \"reached his conclusions via some mystical revelation...His work is an essential part of the scientific and philosophical developments that he initiated.\" Paterson echoes Hegel in writing that Bruno \"ushers in a modern theory of knowledge that understands all natural things in the universe to be known by the human mind through the mind's dialectical structure\".\n\nIngegno writes that Bruno embraced the philosophy of Lucretius, \"aimed at liberating man from the fear of death and the gods.\" Characters in Bruno's \"Cause, Principle and Unity\" desire \"to improve speculative science and knowledge of natural things,\" and to achieve a philosophy \"which brings about the perfection of the human intellect most easily and eminently, and most closely corresponds to the truth of nature.\"\n\nOther scholars oppose such views, and claim Bruno's martyrdom to science to be exaggerated, or outright false. For Yates, while \"nineteenth century liberals\" were thrown \"into ecstasies\" over Bruno's Copernicanism, \"Bruno pushes Copernicus' scientific work back into a prescientific stage, back into Hermetism, interpreting the Copernican diagram as a hieroglyph of divine mysteries.\"\n\nAccording to historian Mordechai Feingold, \"Both admirers and critics of Giordano Bruno basically agree that he was pompous and arrogant, highly valuing his opinions and showing little patience with anyone who even mildly disagreed with him.\" Discussing Bruno's experience of rejection when he visited Oxford University, Feingold suggests that \"it might have been Bruno's manner, his language and his self-assertiveness, rather than his ideas\" that caused offence.\n\nIn his \"Lectures on the History of Philosophy\" Hegel writes that Bruno's life represented \"a bold rejection of all Catholic beliefs resting on mere authority.\"\n\nAlfonso Ingegno states that Bruno's philosophy \"challenges the developments of the Reformation, calls into question the truth-value of the whole of Christianity, and claims that Christ perpetrated a deceit on mankind... Bruno suggests that we can now recognize the universal law which controls the perpetual becoming of all things in an infinite universe.\" A. M. Paterson says that, while we no longer have a copy of the official papal condemnation of Bruno, his heresies included \"the doctrine of the infinite universe and the innumerable worlds\" and his beliefs \"on the movement of the earth\".\n\nMichael White notes that the Inquisition may have pursued Bruno early in his life on the basis of his opposition to Aristotle, interest in Arianism, reading of Erasmus, and possession of banned texts. White considers that Bruno's later heresy was \"multifaceted\" and may have rested on his conception of infinite worlds. \"This was perhaps the most dangerous notion of all... If other worlds existed with intelligent beings living there, did they too have their visitations? The idea was quite unthinkable.\"\n\nFrances Yates rejects what she describes as the \"legend that Bruno was prosecuted as a philosophical thinker, was burned for his daring views on innumerable worlds or on the movement of the earth.\" Yates however writes that \"the Church was... perfectly within its rights if it included philosophical points in its condemnation of Bruno's heresies\" because \"the philosophical points were quite inseparable from the heresies.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", \"in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on the Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy. When [...] Bruno [...] was burned at the stake as a heretic, it had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican cosmology.\"\n\nThe website of the Vatican Secret Archives, discussing a summary of legal proceedings against Bruno in Rome, states: \"In the same rooms where Giordano Bruno was questioned, for the same important reasons of the relationship between science and faith, at the dawning of the new astronomy and at the decline of Aristotle's philosophy, sixteen years later, Cardinal Bellarmino, who then contested Bruno's heretical theses, summoned Galileo Galilei, who also faced a famous inquisitorial trial, which, luckily for him, ended with a simple abjuration.\"\n\nFollowing the 1870 Capture of Rome by the newly created Kingdom of Italy and the end of the Church's temporal power over the city, the erection of a monument to Bruno on the site of his execution became feasible. The monument was sharply opposed by the clerical party, but was finally erected by the Rome Municipality and inaugurated in 1889.\n\nA statue of a stretched human figure standing on its head, designed by Alexander Polzin and depicting Bruno's death at the stake, was placed in Potsdamer Platz station in Berlin on 2 March 2008.\nRetrospective iconography of Bruno shows him with a Dominican cowl but not tonsured. Edward Gosselin has suggested that it is likely Bruno kept his tonsure at least until 1579, and it is possible that he wore it again thereafter.\n\nAn idealized animated version of Bruno appears in the first episode of the 2014 television series \"\". In this depiction, Bruno is shown with a more modern look, without tonsure and wearing clerical robes and without his hood. \"Cosmos\" presents Bruno as an impoverished philosopher who was ultimately executed due to his refusal to recant his belief in other worlds, a portrayal that was criticized by some as simplistic or historically inaccurate.\n\nThe 2016 song \"Roman Sky\" by hard rock band Avenged Sevenfold focuses on the death of Bruno.\n\nAlso the song \"Anima Mundi\" by Massimiliano Larocca and the album \"Numen Lumen\" by neofolk group Hautville, which tracks Bruno's lyrics, were dedicated to the philosopher.\n\nAlgernon Charles Swinburne wrote a poem honouring Giordano Bruno in 1889, when the statue of Bruno was constructed in Rome.\n\nCzeslaw Milosz evokes the story and image of Giordano Bruno in his poem \"Campo Dei Fiori\" (Warsaw 1943).\n\nHeather McHugh depicted Bruno as the principal of a story told (at dinner, by an \"underestimated\" travel guide) to a group of contemporary American poets in Rome. The poem (originally published in McHugh's collection of poems \"Hinge & Sign\", nominee for the National Book Award, and subsequently reprinted widely) channels the very question of ars poetica, or meta-meaning itself, through the embedded narrative of the suppression of Bruno's words, silenced towards the end of his life both literally and literarily.\n\nBruno and his theory of \"the coincidence of contraries\" (\"coincidentia oppositorum\") play an important role in James Joyce's novel \"Finnegans Wake\". Joyce wrote in a letter to his patroness, Harriet Shaw Weaver, \"His philosophy is a kind of dualism – every power in nature must evolve an opposite in order to realise itself and opposition brings reunion\". Amongst his numerous allusions to Bruno in his novel, including his trial and torture, Joyce plays upon Bruno's notion of \"coincidentia oppositorum\" through applying his name to word puns such as \"Browne and Nolan\" (the name of Dublin printers) and '\"brownesberrow in nolandsland\".\n\nGiordano Bruno features as the hero in a series of historical crime novels by S.J.

{"id": "56374963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56374963", "title": "Hanshan and Shide", "text": "Hanshan and Shide\n\nHanshan 寒山 and Shide 拾得 (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku) are popular figures in Zen painting. They have been depicted many times as a pair, and the duo has become an identifiable motif in Zen painting and representative of deeper meanings in Zen Buddhism as a whole. Hanshan, whose name means “Cold Mountain,” is believed to be an eccentric Zen poet from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) who lived on the Tiantang Mountain in Zhejiang Province. Shide, whose name means “foundling” or “pickup,” was a kitchen worker at the nearby Guoqing Temple. He is said to have been abandoned by his family, and then found and raised by Fenggan, another Zen eccentric. As legend goes, the two formed a close friendship, with Shide stealing scraps from the kitchen to bring to Hanshan, and the pair spending time in nature, away from societal structure and institutions. Little is verified about the lives of these two figures, and they “have come to exist only in the works they have left behind.”\n\nHanshan and Shide are easily recognizable in Zen painting. They are almost always depicted wearing scrappy and ratty clothing, appearing disheveled, wandering in nature, laughing, or with mischievous looks on their faces. Hanshan is identified by the scroll he holds in his hand, alluding to his work as a poet. Shide is identified by the broom he holds, which references his work as a kitchen cleaner at the monastery. \n\nThe figures Hanshan and Shide, while often depicted simply and with humor, carry deep symbolism for the religion of Zen Buddhism as a whole. As seen in the attached images, Hanshan’s scroll is often depicted blank. This indicates “that written or printed sutras are nothing compared to the book of nature.” Shide’s broom can be read as a tool to “sweep out of the cobwebs in our impure souls.” Their carefree attitude symbolizes their knowledge that “the things which most men strive for are illusions, and that what really counts is not rank or riches but their own Buddha nature.” Additionally, “in these lunatic figures the Zen artists portray something slightly more than a parody of their own wu-shin or mindless way of life, for as genius is to madness close allied there is a suggestive parallel between the meaningless babble of the happy lunatic and the purposeless life of the Zen sage.” Hanshan and Shide serve the purpose of causing viewers to “confront the fundamental meaning of their own existence.”\n\nMany scholars during the Muromachi period regarded Hanshan and Shide to be incarnations of the bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī (Monju) and Samantabadhra (Fugen). These bodhisattvas represent wisdom and Buddhist practice respectively, perhaps creating a parallel between the wisdom and practice of Hanshan and Shide. Mañjuśrī is often connected to poetry, oratory, and writing, in the same way that Hanshan is connected to his own poems. This comparison suggests the hidden significance of these otherwise eccentric and simple characters.\n\nEarly representations of Hanshan and Shide in Zen painting can be found in images depicting the “Four Sleepers.” The exact creation of this theme is unclear, though it is believed to have been established as a part of Zen painting in China by the early thirteenth century. “The earliest reference known to us concerning the artistic treatment of the subject is a poem in the Rujing Heshang yulu composed by the Chinese abbot Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) for a now lost painting of the ‘Four Sleepers.’”\n\nOne example of early renderings of the “Four Sleepers” is by the Japanese artist Mokuan. In Mokuan’s “Four Sleepers,” Hanshan and Shide are seen sleeping soundly on the ground with Fenggan (the Zen master who found and raised Shide) and Fenggan’s tiger. The inscription on this hanging scroll reads: “Old Fenggan embraces his tiger and sleeps, All huddled together with Shide and Hanshan. They dream their big dream, which lingers on.”The imagery of the Four Sleepers was made popular in Japan through paintings imported from China. Japanese interpretations of the theme emerged as early as the fourteenth century.'\"\n\nImages of the Four Sleepers are meant to symbolize “peaceful coexistence with nature and the enlightened mind,” as the three men sleep soundly among a tiger and outdoors, in nature. Additionally, the sleeping figures hint at a “dream world that cannot be represented on paper” or a “peacefulness of Enlightenment that cannot be attained in the waking world.” Key themes of Zen Buddhism are given shape in images of the Four Sleepers, such as the non-duality of man and animal sleeping peacefully, the serenity of enlightenment, and expunging of opposite figures and forces.\n\nHanshan and Shide are most commonly depicted with just one another. In Zen painting, the two eccentrics are typically shown laughing uproariously, frequently at a Zen joke and at the expense of the “pompous monks” at their monastery. Hanshan and Shide wear shabby clothing and are easily identifiable by their scroll and broom, respectively. Over centuries, Zen painters have depicted these figures in different styles and manners, though keep to the main themes, motifs, and ideas that the pair represents.\n\nPaintings of Hanshan and Shide were favored among Zen monks following the Chinese Song Dynasty (960-1279), and grew in popularity in the 13th and 14th centuries in China and Japan. During the 14th century, important Zen painters like Yintuoluo, a Chan monk born in India who lived in China during the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), created images of Hanshan and Shide that are now considered national treasures in Japan. During this period, painters followed traditional standards for figure painting, with a combination of thin and delicate lines to render their faces and thicker lines on their bodies. These images were almost always accompanied by an inscription, though not all have been translated or attributed to an author. This style of painting is also exemplified through Kao Ninga’s \"Zen Eccentrics Hanshan and Shide\", a pair of paintings depicting the figures.\n\nThe subject of Hanshan and Shide remained popular in Zen painting in the 15th century. During the Muromachi Period (1392-1573) in Japan, artists like Resai experimented with color and tonality more so than in previous centuries. Resai’s depiction of Hanshan and Shide is complex and contemplative, as the pair is seen on the pair on a mountain’s edge with a vast space of nothingness beyond where they stand. They are shown in discussion and pointing out to the nothingness, perhaps exploring different facets of enlightenment as they often did. There are varying tones of ink, and areas are shaded and filled in. Resai stays true to common themes with Hanshan and Shide, showing their scroll, broom, joyous faces, and depicting them in nature.\n\nAlso painting during the Muromachi period was Sesshū Tōyō, who is described as the most prominent master of ink painting from this time. Sesshu Toyo’s painting of Kanzan and Jittoku differs from others seen, as it is a bust length image of the two figures’ faces. Sesshu Toyo pays great attention to rendering their emotions and mischievous glances, as they laugh together while Kanzan holds a blank scroll. Through this, he captures the essence of the two figures. Sesshu Toyo employs variation in ink tonalities and in the thickness of his lines. There is three dimensional modeling to the faces and hands of the figures, demonstrating a more elevated and advanced style of painting.\n\nRepresentations of Hanshan and Shide remained very popular in Japan in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and well into the 19th century.\n\nIn the late 18th century, during the Edo Period (1615-1868), Ito Jakuchu painted \"Hanshan and Shide (Kanzan and Jittoku)\". His rendition is more abstract than any of the aforementioned paintings. The figures are depicted embracing and in opposites – one in a black robe and one in a white robe, with a scroll at their feet and a broom rising up. There is no background, placing the focus on the figures themselves. The inscription is attributed to Ike Taiga (Japanese, 1723-1776) and reads:\"One is the Bodhisattva of the Great Path,The other is the Patriarch of the Great Buddha.What evidence is there? A broken broom, a tattered scripture, and unrhymed verse.”\nThe inscription references their emanations of Mañjuśrī (Monju) and Samantabadhra (Fugen).\n\nIn the 19th century, Japanese Zen painter Mochizuki Gyokuzen created a hanging scroll depicting the pair. Here, we see a shift in style from previous centuries. This painting is done in a more graphic manner, and Mochizuki Gyokuzen employs different colors and sharper lines to create a more cartoon-looking image of the pair. The figures are emotive and looking upwards at something outside of the picture frame, rather than at a scroll. Still, we see the common motifs of the ragged clothing, the broom, and the blank scroll in Kanzan’s hand.\n\nAlso in the 19th century, during the Meiji Period (1868-1912), was Hashimoto Gahō. His hanging scroll depicting the pair is done in ink and slight tint on paper, harkening back to the simple ink and wash paintings of previous centuries, though done in a far more modern manner. Hashimoto Gaho employs variations in ink tonalities and texture, as seen through the fuzzy hair, the different tones of the ground they stand on, and the fur on Kanzan’s skirt. Jittoku is seen laughing and pointing to the blank scroll, while Kanzan looks on in amusement. The faces of the two figures are three dimensionally modeled, making them appear more realistic and modern than past renderings. The tree branches point downward to the characters to direct the attention of viewers. Nearly every common motif associated with the figures are employed in this painting, though it is done in a modern and expressive manner.\n\nAviman, Galit. \"Zen Paintings in Edo Japan (1600-1868): Playfulness and Freedom in the Artwork of Hakuin Ekaku and Sengai Gibon\". , 2014.

The progenitor of this lineage of scholars was Hayashi Razan, who lived to witness his philosophical and pragmatic reasoning become a foundation for the dominant ideology of the \"bakufu\" until the end of the 19th century.\n\nThis evolution developed in part from the official Hayashi \"schema\" equating samurai with the cultured governing class (although the samurai were largely illiterate at the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate). The Hayashi helped to legitimize the role of the militaristic \"bakufu\" at the beginning of its existence. His philosophy is also important in that it encouraged the samurai class to cultivate themselves, a trend which would become increasingly widespread over the course of his lifetime and beyond. One of Razan's aphorism encapsulates this view:\n\nThe Hayashi played a prominent role is helping to maintain the theoretical underpinnings of the Tokugawa regime; and Hayashi \"Daigaku-no-kami\" Akira was the 11th hereditary rector of \"Yushima Seidō\".\n\nAkira assumed his role as rector of the academy in 1853; and his initial foray into diplomacy followed soon after.\n\nSignificantly, this would have been the first time the emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. The most easily identified consequence of this transitional overture would be the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade. There is no small irony in the fact that this 19th-century scholar/bureaucrat would find himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change—moving arguably \"by the book\" through uncharted waters with well-settled theories as the only guide.\n\n\n\n"}

The main ethical category for ancient Greeks was aretē, which is usually translated into English as \"virtue\" but sometimes as \"excellence,\" which is closer in meaning. Aretē means an excellence of strength or ability, and is ultimately bound up with the notion of the fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential. The objective of a successful life was attaining timē, or honor. Also an important concept in Greek culture was that of hybris, trying to go beyond one's possibilities. The literary source of this folk ethical theory can be seen in Homer, Greek tragedy and also Aesop's fables. \n\nThe first philosophers, the Presocratics, occasionally reflected on ethics. Heraclitus thought that injustice appears only in the eyes of men, and that a divine perspective would show that everything is just. Pythagoras founded a sect in which a good reincarnation (metempsychosis) was to be attained through following certain ascetic practices. Democritus proposed cheerfulness as the supreme goal of life.\n\nAn important change came with the Sophist movement, who resembled professional teachers. They traveled from one city to another, and were concerned with ethical problems. Protagoras was a sophist and the first formulator of relativism in Western thought. By saying man is the measure of all things, he attacked the unchallenged notion of a fixed reality.\n\nSocrates was a milestone in the history of ethics. He regarded for the first time aretē as the rational part of the human soul/mind (\"psychē\").\n\n"}

He was from Nijmegen, and studied at the University of Paris, where he received his \"magister artium\" and \"baccalaureus formatus in sacra pagina\" (1463).\n\nAs a student of Paris, Hennon was heavily influenced by William of Ockham and Roger Bacon. He wrote a Latin commentary on the \"Physics\" of Aristotle, the \"Commentarii in Aristotelis libros Physicorum\", which was completed on 1 October 1473 if a seventeenth-century source is to be believed. Examining the state of science in the late Middle Ages, physicist, historian, and philosopher Pierre Duhem, in \"Le système du monde\", isolates Hennon's account of the vacuum and a plurality of worlds.\n\nHennon believed that nature abhors a vacuum and therefore no natural void was possible, though God could create one. A void, however, is not defined by a positive distance between surfaces in which there is nothing, but rather as the capacity (\"potentialitas\") for a body to be interposed between the two surfaces equal to that which is there when it is full. Hennon affirms that ice is denser than liquid water, and that a sealed vase of water will break upon freezing because nature abhors a vacuum. He believes further that two smooth plates could not be separated (again, because nature abhors a vacuum) unless there were some air still between them, which with enough force may become rarefied, allowing the plates to be separated.\n\nHennon is less original on a plurality of worlds, where he borrows text verbatim from Albert of Saxony's \"Quaestiones in libros de Caelo et Mundo\". He follows Albert and John Buridan in asserting that a multiplicity of worlds is not contradictory and therefore possible through divien omnipotence. In fact, God could create an infinite multitude of beings, since Hennon finds no contradiction between infinity and magnitude. Duhem in his analysis of Hennon's chapter \"De Caelo et Mundo\", argues that Hennon relied on the Condemnations of 1277 by Stephen Tempier to attack Aristotelian physics, and thus the position that the earth cannot move.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19007372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19007372", "title": "Laws of Eshnunna", "text": "Laws of Eshnunna\n\nThe Laws of Eshnunna (abrv. LE) are inscribed on two cuneiform tablets discovered in Tell Abū Harmal, Baghdad, Iraq. The Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities headed by Taha Baqir unearthed two parallel sets of tablets in 1945 and 1947. The two tablets are separate copies of an older source and date back to ca. 1930 BC. The differences between the Code of Hammurabi and the Laws of Eshnunna significantly contributed to illuminating the development of ancient and cuneiform law. Eshnunna was north of Ur on the Tigris River and became politically important after the fall of the third dynasty of Ur, founded by Ur-Nammu. \n\nIn distinction from the other Mesopotamian collections of law, this one got its name after the city where it had originated – Eshnunna, located on the bank of the Diyala River, tributary to the Tigris. This collection of laws is not a real systemized codex; nearly sixty of its sections are preserved. The Laws are written in Akkadian and consist of two tablets which are marked with A and B. In 1948, Albrecht Goetze of the Yale University had translated and published them. In some sources the Laws of Eshnunna are mentioned as the Laws of Bilalama due to the belief that the Eshnunnian ruler probably was their originator, but Goetze maintained that tablet B was originated under the reign of Dadusha. The text of the prologue is broken at the point where the ruler who promulgated the laws was specified.\n\nAlbrecht Goetze has noticed the specific style of expression. The laws were composed in a mode that facilitated memorizing. A distinguished Israeli scientist and one of the foremost experts on this collection of laws, Reuven Yaron of the University of Jerusalem concerning this matter stated: “What matters to me – and might have mattered to those who fashioned them almost 4000 years ago – is the ease of remembering the text.”\n\nThe conditional sentence (“If A then B” – as it also is the case with the other Mesopotamian laws) is an attribute of this codification. In 23 paragraphs, it appears in the form šumma awilum – “If a man…” After the disposition, a precise sanction follows, e.g. LU42(A): “If a man bit and severed the nose of a man, one mina silver he shall weigh out.”\n\nThe Laws clearly show signs of social stratification, mainly focussing on two different classes: the muškenum and awilum. The audience of the Laws of Eshnunna is more extensive than in the case of the earlier cuneiform codifications: awilum – free men and women (mar awilim and marat awilim), muškenum, wife (aššatum), son (maru), slaves of both sexes – male (wardum) and female (amtum) – which are not only objects of law as in classical slavery, and delicts where the victims were slaves have been sanctioned, and other class designations as ubarum, apþarum, mudum that are not ascertained.\n\nReuven Yaron has divided the offences of the Laws of Eshnunna into five groups. The articles of the first group had to be collected from all over the Laws and the articles of the other four were roughly ordered one after the other:\n\n1. Theft and related offences,\n\n2. False distraint,\n\n3. Sexual offences,\n\n4. Bodily injuries,\n\n5. Damages caused by a goring ox and comparable cases.\n\nThe majority of these offences were penalized with pecuniary fines (an amount of silver), but some serious offences such as burglary, murder, and sexual offences were penalized with death. It seems that the capital punishment was avoidable (in contrast to the Code of Hammurabi), because of the standard formulation: “It is a case of life … he shall die”.\n\n\n\n"}

Though this text was originally attributed to Bodhidharma, a great deal of material was added to it, probably around the 8th century, by the monks or perhaps other anonymous groups.

He is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Maryland, College Park, associate member of Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Program and member of the Committee for Philosophy and the Sciences.\n\nBefore he moved to the University of Maryland in 2001, Carruthers was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield where he founded and directed the Hang Seng Centre for Cognitive Studies and prior to that was a lecturer at University of Essex, Queen's University of Belfast, University of St. Andrews, and University of Oxford. He was educated at the University of Leeds before studying for his D.Phil at University of Oxford under Michael Dummett.\n\nCarruthers' primary research interests are in philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychology, and cognitive science. He has worked especially on theories of consciousness, the role of natural language in human cognition, and modularity of mind, but has also published on such issues as: the mentality of animals; the nature and status of our folk psychology; nativism (innateness); human creativity; theories of intentional content; and defence of a notion of narrow content for psychological explanation. He is presently working on a book project, tentatively entitled Mind-reading and Meta-cognition, which examines the cognitive basis of our understanding of the minds of others and its relationship to our access to our own minds. He has also written a book in applied ethics, arguing that animals do not have moral rights.\n\nThere is a spectrum of opinions on the role of language in cognition. At one extreme, philosophers like Michael Dummett have argued that thought is impossible in the absence of language; and social scientists influenced by Benjamin Whorf have believed that the natural languages that people grow up speaking will have a profound influence on the character of their thoughts. At the other extreme, philosophers like Jerry Fodor, together with most cognitive scientists, have believed that language is but an input/output device for cognition, playing no significant role in thought itself. Peter Carruthers has steered a path in between these two extremes. In his 1996 book, he allowed that much thought can and does occur in the absence of language, while arguing for a constitutive role for language in conscious thinking, conducted in \"inner speech\". In his 2006 book, this position is broadened and deepened. Following Antonio Damasio, he argues that mental rehearsals of action issue in imagery that plays a profound role in human practical reasoning, with inner speech now being seen as a subset of action rehearsal. Carruthers now argues that the serial use of these rehearsals can issue in a whole new \"level\" of thinking and reasoning, serving to realize the “dual systems” that psychologists like Daniel Kahneman believe to be involved in human reasoning processes.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists like Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, and Steven Pinker have claimed that the mind consists of a great many distinct functionally specialized systems, or modules. Jerry Fodor has argued, in contrast, that the \"central\" processes of the mind (judging, reasoning, deciding, and so forth) \"cannot\" be modular. In his 2006 book, Peter Carruthers lays out the main case supporting massive modularity, shows how the notion of \"module\" in this context should properly be understood, and takes up Fodor’s challenge by showing how the distinctive flexibility, creativity, and rationality of the human mind can result from the interactions of massive numbers of modules.\n\nAmongst philosophers who think that consciousness admits of explanation, the most popular approach has been some or other variety of representationalism. Representationalists hold that the distinctive features of consciousness can be explained by appeal to the representational contents (together with the causal roles) of experience. First-order representationalists like Fred Dretske and Michael Tye (philosopher) believe that the relevant contents are world-directed ones (colors, sounds, and so forth) of a distinctive sort (non-conceptual, analog, or fine-grained). Higher-order representationalists like William Lycan, David M. Rosenthal, and Peter Carruthers, in contrast, maintain that we need to be aware of undergoing these first-order experiences in order for the latter to qualify as conscious. On Carruthers' view, the awareness in question is dispositional. By virtue of an experience being available to higher-order thought, it is claimed to acquire a higher-order non-conceptual content. Hence, conscious experiences have a dual content: while representing the world to us, they also represent themselves to us. Conscious experiences are thus held to be self-representational ones.\n\nMost people (philosophers and non-philosophers alike) assume that they have direct introspective access to their own propositional attitude events of judging, deciding, and so forth. We think of ourselves as knowing our own thought processes immediately, without having to interpret ourselves (in the way that we \"do\" need to interpret the behavior and circumstances of other people if we are to know what \"they\" are thinking). In a series of recent papers Peter Carruthers has argued that this introspective intuition is illusory. While allowing that we do have introspective access to our own experiences, including imagistic experiences of the sort that occur during \"inner speech\", he draws on evidence from across the cognitive sciences to argue that our knowledge of our own judgments and decisions results from us turning our interpretative skills upon ourselves. He also argues that while inner speech plays important roles in human cognition, it never plays the right \"sort\" of role to constitute a judgment, or a decision. The latter processes always occur below the surface of consciousness, Carruthers claims.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "523763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523763", "title": "Public display of affection", "text": "Public display of affection\n\nPublic displays of affection (PDA) are acts of physical intimacy in the view of others. What is an acceptable display of affection varies with respect to culture and context. Displays of affection in a public place, such as the street, are more likely to be objected to, than similar practices in a private place with only people from a similar cultural background present. Some organizations have rules limiting or prohibiting public displays of affection.\n\nPhysical affection has been defined as \"any touch intended to arouse feelings of love in the giver and/or the recipient.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"get a room\" is a phrase that is usually said when one feels a sense of disapproval after seeing what they consider to be an excessive public display of affection.\n\nVarious studies have found physical affection to be associated with positive outcomes in romantic relationships. For instance, it has been related to the formation of attachment bonds and psychological intimacy. Physical affection has been categorized into seven different types including holding hands, cuddling/holding, backrubs/massages, caressing/stroking, kissing on the face, hugging, and kissing on the lips. Five of these behaviors, with the exception of caressing/stroking and holding hands, have been significantly positively associated with relationship and partner satisfaction.\n\nExpression of a person’s feelings towards someone else had previously been limited to written letters, phone calls or in person. In the modern world, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are growing, with 1.7 billion users on Facebook and over half a billion Twitter users. Studies on relationships through Facebook found that, when two individuals who are interested in one another both use Facebook regularly, their relationship progresses in different increments than how it would without social media. After two people meet and form an interest, one or both individuals will go onto the other person’s Facebook page and get information such as relationship status, pictures, and interests. Once a relationship begins, some couples broadcast their relationship with posts, such as pictures and changing the relationship status.\n\nHow people show their public displays of affection on social media sites can be indicative of relationship security and personality. Frequent and recent communication with a romantic partner through different forms of social media is an indicator of relational escalation, whereas limited communication has shown to be an indicator of alienation or relational de-escalation. Another study has shown that when someone focuses on relationship status and public displays of affection such as posting about activities with the significant other or his or her feelings towards them, that person tends to be more possessive or territorial over their partner.\n\nA study found female characters on prime time televisions programs are significantly less likely to demonstrate physical affection if they had a larger body type than thinner female characters. Thus, even television producers act in a way as to intentionally limit public displays of affection based on the appearance of their actors, and that might affect viewership based on social disapproval. Regardless of television portrayals, the frequency and intensity of PDA has a tendency to depend upon the cultural context as well as perceived public perceptions of the couple, including their age group, racial composition, sexuality, and relationship centralized activity on social media.\n\nIt is well recognized that relationships outside the family become increasingly important during adolescence. Although several studies of basic social processes have been conducted by sociologists, much of the research and theorizing about adolescent relationships has been carried out by developmental psychologists. Much more research has been done in the area of specific adolescent behaviors, which has shown that these behaviors are predicted well by relationship variables to include the display of affection.\nAffection or intimacy references a pattern of conduct within relationships that includes subjective assessments of attachment. This pattern of conduct is a part of a larger constellation of factors that contributes to an adolescent’s development of a non-parental relationship. A number of sociologists have explored the more general terrain of gender relations, although several of the key studies focus on preadolescence and early adolescence. Their work is important in highlighting the degree to which features of these early relations, and even intense personal feelings such as being in love, are socially constructed. Adolescents' conceptions about and conduct within these relationships are heavily influenced by interaction and communication with other girls or other boys. Specific rules emerge (e.g., one should always be in love, it is wrong to date more than one person, heterosexuality is the only acceptable romantic option) and gossip or other social sanctions serve as important sources of informal social control around these rules.\nResearch moves into the early adolescent period when youths are old enough to say they are going steady and is useful in actually characterizing the nature of these relationships. These liaisons are described as highly superficial and based on unrealistic idealized expectations. Furthermore, the desire of adolescents to put on a good \"front\" inhibits the development of intimacy. Going steady is a limiting factor on the adolescent social ritual.\n\nThis table below shows the quality and context of displays of affection in adolescence who are in intra and inter racial relationships.\n\nBoys and girls begin the process of relating to one another, the transition is much easier for adolescent males, who essentially transport their dominant interaction styles (derived from peer interactions) into this new relationship form with the opposite sex. Public displays of affection may facilitate the demonstration of this dominant interaction style transference in a socially acceptable way. Experimental research on communication processes observed in same- and mixed-gender groups to support this idea. Although behavior observed in cross-gender task groups is relevant, intimate dyadic relationships and task groups are not equivalent social contexts. Thus, an alternative hypothesis is that boys, who have less practice than their female counterparts with PDA (by virtue of their peer group experiences), must make a larger developmental leap as they move into the heterosexual arena. For example, examining the messages students write one another in high-school yearbooks, we observed marked differences between boys' discourse directed toward friends (e.g., \"you're a lousy wrestler…\") and that directed toward romantic partners (e.g., \"you are very beautiful in so many ways, it would take me a lifetime to express them in words…\"). In contrast, young girls use of language in messages to close friends and boyfriends is more similar in form and content. To the degree that the romantic context provides their only opportunity to express themselves and, more broadly, to relate in this intimate fashion, young males can be considered more dependent on these relations than female adolescents, who have close friends for intimate talk and social support. Of course, this quality of uniqueness may figure into the etiology of more negative and sometimes gendered relational dynamics that also emerge in connection with romantic involvements stalking, intrusive control efforts, violence and the like.\n\nImplicit or explicit attitudes towards interracial relationships strongly affect interpretations of public displays of affection within this context. These attitudes can be influenced by a plethora of factors, including social contact. For example, personal involvement and extended contact (media representations) with interracial and Black-White relationships has been linked to more positive perspectives regarding interracial relationships. Thus, personal experience and mere exposure to interracial couples tends to be related to more favorable attitudes. This finding supports the contact hypothesis, which states that if interpersonal interactions between group members of each race will decrease prejudice and foster amicable connections between races. Beyond the conditions of equal group status, common goals, group cooperation, and social approval, some studies have found other stipulations important for fostering positive relations. For instance, it’s important for the interracial contact to be intimate instead of superficial, for it to happen in many different settings, and for it to happen repeatedly with more than one individual from the other race.\n\nNot everyone, especially those with learned biases and/or racist attitudes, is likely to be exposed to another race under these exact conditions; this lack of exposure to racial diversity will further perpetuate the internal cycle of unsubstantiated prejudice. In fact, the larger presence of African-Americans, Latinos and Asians in neighborhoods and religious congregations significantly predicts higher support from Caucasians for interracial marriages with these other races. Furthermore, it has been found that higher numbers of individuals from each of these racial groups in these social settings predict more interracial friendships. Therefore, it appears that reducing the socially imposed distance between one’s in-group and out-group can result in developing more favorable attitudes towards romantic relationships between races. The problem still exists though that many people who have negative attitudes towards other races will avoid social settings where they may be exposed to other races due to ingrained stereotypes, opting instead to surround themselves with members of their in-group. In general, one study using survey data found that approximately half of African-American respondents versus about a quarter of Caucasian respondents approve of a close relative marrying an individual of the other race. Accordingly, it appears that the problem is pervasive to the point that there are a large proportion of individuals on both sides of the equation who do not approve of interracial relationships.\n\nDue to perceptions of others’ attitudes towards interracial relationships, many interracial couples may engage in certain behavioral strategies to reduce stigma and ostracism. Research shows that adolescent interracial couples tend to participate in fewer public and private activities than couples composed of individuals from the same race. Significant differences have been found between these two groups on holding hands in public, whereby interracial couples are less likely to do so, yet these differences do not maintain significance in the context of private displays of intimate affection. Therefore, it appears that the fear of being negatively judged in public inhibits interracial couples from displaying physical affection in comparison to couples of the same race. Interracial couples have also been found to engage in other strategies to deter potential judgment, including ignoring public harassment to avoid confrontation, staying at home or filtering their social group to increase acceptance, attending social gatherings attended only by other interracial couples, and publicly surrounding themselves with members of their social support network.\n\nConsequently, many interracial couples still fear perceptions of public displays of affection, even though increased exposure and contact with other races under harmonious conditions is associated with more favorable attitudes towards interracial relationships. This is made evident in less engagement in these behaviors publicly as well as forms of premeditated coping strategies in response to public harassment. As the research is limited, it is difficult to definitively determine if these behavioral responses are contingent upon the social setting as well as the racial composition of the surrounding public, i.e., would an interracial couple be more likely to engage in public displays of affection in a racially diverse crowd, or a party of friends as opposed to strangers? Moreover, the majority of the extant literature has examined interracial couples composed of African American and Caucasian individuals, neglecting potential differences with different groups of minority interracial groups, e.g., Asian/Latino, African-American/Asian. Therefore, future research should examine the different dynamics of interracial relationships, including individual differences, social status, social setting, socio-economic status, and other psychosocial factors that may contribute to the engagement or avoidance of public displays of affection.\n\nPublic displays of affection between individuals of the same sex may or may not suggest homosexuality depending on the cultural context. For example, in many African cultures it is socially acceptable for people of the same sex to participate in public displays of affection, whereas in other countries such as the United States and Portugal, it is considered indicative of homosexuality. Public displays of affection tend to be determined largely by culture which greatly influences perceptions of same-sex PDA.\n\nIntolerance for homosexual PDA is common place in large swaths of society in many different cultures. For instance, in Portugal, LGBT individuals only act in ways that contend contemporary ideals and political/economic agendas. Homosexual individuals are less likely to partake in public displays of affection because their society is extremely critical of the act. They believe that by behaving according to what society deems appropriate, (e.g., only opposite-sex couples should partake in acts of public displays of affection), they are protecting themselves from being categorized as abnormal, odd, or deviant. Although same-sex marriage has been legal in Portugal since June 2010 (see Same-sex marriage in Portugal), LGBT people still refrain from public displays of affection for the most part. This detail may suggest that Portugal’s acceptance of same-sex marriage is due to the fact that the LGBT individuals do not broadcast their sexuality, not that the public of Portugal is more accepting of these acts. Although it may appear that homosexual individuals are ambivalent about being limited in only displaying affection privately, it seems to happen out of fear of resentment or being perceived as odd rather than out of respect for their societies’ political beliefs and attitudes.\n\nThere have been many in depth studies regarding societal attitudes towards homosexuality across many different factors. One study found that heterosexual people had higher negative attitudes towards homosexuals of their own sex, especially if they felt that they were being targets of sexual advances. They also found that men have less negative attitudes towards homosexual females than males whereas women tend to be more accepting overall of homosexuals and their role in society. In the contemporary Western society, attitudes towards same-sex public displays of affection vary city to city much like they vary country to country. Studies have shown that in populations where the majority of individuals have high cultural values and are more accommodating, same-sex or same gender public displays of affection are more likely to occur. This is understandable because same sex individuals feel less persecuted by others in society and are less likely to feel as though they are being categorized as odd, abnormal, or deviant like those in Portugal.\nOf course, there are negative attitudes towards same-sex or same gender public displays of affection as well. In a Colorado high school, two yearbook staff resigned after they were informed that they could not print the relationship page because it had a photo of two females holding hands. A spokesman for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project declared in 2007 that \"people are still verbally harassed and physically attacked daily for engaging in simple displays of affection in public. Everything changes the minute we kiss\".\n\nReligiosity is one important factor that influences how romantic relationships develop in other countries. Higher levels of religiosity are not directly related to the number of partners reported by the respondents. However, religious respondents report lower levels of intimate contact with their partners. It is apparent that religiosity influences the level of expression of affection in general. Also, religion is related to more conservative values that may have a global effect on all levels of PDA by younger participants.\nSeemingly religiosity may work in two different ways where religious communities are in general quite racially segregated in the around the world, and people with strong religious beliefs may be very unlikely to engage in sexual activity or even to date someone due to the morals advised by their religion. In many regions of the world, religion drives the cultural view on PDA and this sometimes culminates into proscription based on religious rules, for example sharia law. The conservative Islamic schools of thought, especially Salafism-oriented ones forbid public displays of affection.\n\nIn most of the Western world, such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, it is very common to see people holding hands, hugging and sometimes kissing in public. It is not usually socially acceptable to be overly explicit, such as engaging in sexual activities. Kissing is more commonly seen in adult night-life, such as nightclubs.\n\nMothers from the Manchu minority ethnic group, as only researched in the 1900s in Aigun of Northern Manchuria where the researcher S. M. Shirokogoroff personally believed the Manchu element were \"purer\" than those of Southern Manchuria and Peking, used to show affection for their children by performing fellatio on their male babies, placing the penis in their mouths and stimulating it, while the regarded public kissing with revulsion.\n\nPublic display of affection is regarded as unacceptable in India. Kissing and hugging are taboo. However, same sex physical contact is allowed. Under section 294 of the Indian Penal Code, causing annoyance to others through \"obscene acts\" is a criminal offence with a punishment of imprisonment up to 3 months or a fine, or both. Because this law does not give explicit definitions of \"obscene acts\", it is blatantly misused by police and lower courts to harass couples. For example, in 2007, when actor Richard Gere kissed Shilpa Shetty in an AIDS awareness event in New Delhi, a warrant for his arrest was issued by an Indian court. People burnt effigies of Gere and Shetty for publicly embracing in a \"sexually provocative\" way. These cases of harassment of dating couples are generally bitterly criticized by a growing number of young Indians, who feel the need for a change in the perception on dating and public displays of affection. In the past, attacks by vigilante groups also were a danger for those celebrating Valentine's Day. However the number of couples celebrating Valentine's Day has grown so much that these attacks have become ineffective in deterring couples. However, relaxation of previous generations' social norms has made public displays of affection more common among India's younger demographic. In the state of Kerala, a public hugging and kissing campaign (named Kiss Of Love) was launched in November 2014 in protest against moral policing.\n\nIndonesia is the most populous Muslim country in the world. Muslim practices and Islamic traditions have grown stronger over the past few years, and they consider public displays of affections taboo. Heavy or passionate kissing could carry a \"maximum penalty of five years in jail or a 250 million rupiah ($29,000 fine)\".\n\nIn general, public displays of affection are less prevalent in Japan. It is typical for Japanese families to bow to each other when greeting or when saying goodbye. In Japanese culture, where shame plays a huge part in motivating behavior, it’s often about trying not to lose face. Because of this, Japanese people care deeply about what others think of them, including friends, coworkers, family members, and even total strangers. Propensity to engage in public display of affection is heavily influenced by the culture and thus it is rare for anything more intimate than hand-holding to occur; kissing goodbye is likely out of the question.\n\nMiddle Eastern countries such as Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt are predominantly Muslim cultures. Although public displays of affection generally do not fit the local culture and customs, it varies even among these countries. Decency laws do not allow public displays of affection. Penalties can be severe based on the action in different countries. Travelers to Dubai have been sentenced to lengthy jail sentences for kissing in public, according to the U.S. Department of State. In 2009 a British couple caught publicly kissing in Dubai was deported following a three-month prison sentence. An unmarried Indian couple, who were in a taxi, was sentenced to one year in prison for hugging and kissing. The taxi driver drove the couple directly to a police station. Kissing is considered \"an offense to public decency\".\n\nIn Iran holding hands has become more and more popular especially in big cities and among young generations.\n\n"}

For example, based on the discovery of the outstanding diversity of mosses, lichens and liverworts (5% of the world's total) in the Magellanic sub-Antarctic ecoregion, Dr. Ricardo Rozzi and his colleagues has coined the term Tourism with a Hand Lens to refer to a new speciality tourism being promoted in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve.

In turn, Rozzi and the Omora Ethnobotanical Park have metaphorically called these small plant communities the \"Miniature Forests of Cape Horn\" to help the broader society understand the ecological role played by these tiny, but diverse, abundant and important organisms.\n\nIn a recent review of the impact of Aldo Leopold's \"The Land Ethic\", his son Carl Leopold termed Rozzi's work \"ecological ethics\", placing it on its own branch in the \"tree-like\" genealogy he conceived as the legacy of his father's seminal conservation and environmental philosophy work.\n\nAs a prolific writer, Rozzi's academic productivity includes dozens of articles, translations, chapters, and books on multiple topics that range from ethnoornithology to environmental education and philosophy to conservation.

{"id": "19774291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19774291", "title": "Sebastiano Maffettone", "text": "Sebastiano Maffettone\n\nSebastiano Maffettone (1948) is University Professor and Dean of the Political Science Department at LUISS Guido Carli University of Rome, where he teaches Political Philosophy and Theories of Globalization. He has taught in several Italian universities (Turin, Palermo, Naples and Rome) as well as International universities (Harvard, Columbia, Boston College, Tufts University, Paris, Delhi, University of Pennsylvania to mention a few). Maffettone graduated summa cum laude from the University of Naples in 1970, and he completed his graduate studies in social philosophy LSE in 1976, under the supervision of philosophers such as Karl Popper and Amartya K. Sen.\n\nIn the late ‘70s, Maffettone translated into Italian \"A Theory of Justice\", the work of the American philosopher John Rawls, whose influence defined the focus of Maffettone’s philosophical approach. Rawls’s liberal perspective and the liberal approach on social and political issues became the milestone of his lifelong research.\n\nCommitted to bringing Rawls’s innovative thought to Europe, Maffettone begun to be widely known for his active participation in the academic life, earning the merit of having introduced important scientific novelties, especially in the Italian cultural debate. Besides his growing academic production, Maffettone started to contribute to the public debate through collaborations with major Italian newspapers such as Corriere della Sera, Il Mattino, Il Messaggero, Il Sole24ore and magazines such as Panorama, L’Espresso, and Reset. For his commitment in the current public debate, Maffettone is considered a public intellectual.\n\nHe has also founded and edited philosophy journals (\"Notizie di Politeia\" and \"Filosofia e questioni pubbliche\") and research centers (Centro per la Ricerca e lo Studio dei Diritti Umani and Center for Ethics and Global Politics), published scholarly articles on different subjects, and contributed to the public debate on various cultural issues thanks to a wide network of international relationships, participation in seminars, workshops and conferences in Italy and abroad.\n\nOne of Maffettone’s contributions to the Italian academy probably is the creation of the Società italiana di filosofia politica (the Italian Society of Political Philosophy). Under his presidency, the society became a point of reference for the Italian political philosophers, and the political life of the country.\n\nMaffettone is author of 16 volumes, many of which have deeply influenced European scientific community. Two of his books, \"Il valore della vita\" (1998), and \"Etica pubblica\" (2001) bridge the gap between applied ethics and political theory, which represents a recurrent theme of Maffettone’s philosophical project. \"Il valore della vita\" presents a rationalist and liberal Lebenphilosophie. Its basic underpinnings come from bioethics, but go beyond this and propose a non-religious, comprehensive theory of life. \"Etica pubblica\" grounds a public understanding of ethics, which the author brought to the attention of the Italian public. The most widely read and criticized chapters were those on business ethics. It is worth noting how, in the case of both these books, theoretical and practical experiences have found a felicitous convergence.\n\nTogether with Ronald Dworkin, Maffettone published \"I fondamenti del liberalismo\" (2008) in which the two authors present their views of liberalism, agreeing in some areas and diverging on others, to begin with the relationship between ethics and politics. This book opened an important critical discussion on liberalism in Italy, which is still ongoing these very days.\n\nRecently, the most importance evidence of his intellectual achievements can be seen in his book \"La pensabilità del mondo\" (2006, the English version is forthcoming), where he presents an original theory within the field of ethics of international relations. Maffettone’s view is based on the idea of “pluralistic integration”, which tries to represent an alternative to cosmopolitanism. The core idea is that liberalism and democracy cannot be imposed from the outside but must come from inside a culture or a nation. The same kind of argument was cashed out in two articles in English, one on the European model of “normative regionalism” (published in “The Monist”), the other on global justice (forthcoming in the collective UNESCO volume, edited by Thomas Pogge).\n\nAmong his last publications, there is a solid and comprehensive introduction to the thought of John Rawls (Rawls: An Introduction, Polity Press 2010). In this work, Maffettone interprets Rawls along three hermeneutical hypotheses: the interpretive hypothesis; the methodological hypothesis; and the theoretical hypothesis.\nThe interpretive hypothesis concerns the much-debated question of the continuity or discontinuity between Rawls 1 (1950–80) and Rawls 2 (1980–2002). Prima facie, discontinuity seems to prevail, given that Rawls’ main books discuss three different subjects: \"A Theory of Justice\" deals with social justice; \"Political Liberalism\" deals with the main flaws of \"A Theory of Justice\" as well as with political legitimacy; \"The Law of Peoples\" extends and modifies the previous model in the light of global justice. However, after reflection one can detect a substantial continuity. Of course, there are significant partial discontinuities, like the ones Rawls enjoins with regard to rational choice theory and, more relevantly, with regard to some passages within the third part of \"A Theory of Justice\" concerning stability.\nThe methodological hypothesis is designed to complement the interpretive hypothesis by presenting a unitary thread through which we can trigger the desired continuity in our reading of Rawls. This thread follows the basic device Rawls never abandoned, namely the ‘priority of the right’. \nThe theoretical hypothesis is based on the idea that the asymmetry between the right and the good depends on a deeper dialectics between justification and legitimation. According to this distinction, justification looks for the best theoretical argument, is intrinsically substantive, goes top-down and is rooted in the moral and metaphysical bases of a specific culture. Legitimation, on the other hand, is normally based on an institutional practice, concerns mainly the inputs of a political process, goes bottom- up and does not directly appeal to the moral and metaphysical roots of a culture.\nMaffettone claims that justification and legitimation must be seen as complementary. Assuming the fact of pluralism in contemporary liberal-democratic societies, we can have different plausible justifications in reciprocal conflict, but we have to rely on the same institutional legitimation for the sake of stability (for the right reasons).\n\nRegarding bioethics, Maffettone was a member of what was probably the first Italian ethical commission in a hospital, under the direction of Umberto Veronesi (with whom Maffettone continues to work in these years) at the Istituto Tumori, based in Milan.\n\nMaffettone also formulated the theoretical outline of business ethics, which is perhaps the most important Italian deontological code; moreover, he wrote many other codes and formulated other social budgets – among which the one proposed to Confindustria in 1992 in an extremely delicate political and social moment for Italy.\n\nMaffettone’s synthesis of theoretical reflections and practical applications can be tracked also in his participation to the scientific commissions of influential cultural foundations (like the Fondazione Adriano Olivetti and the Fondazione Einaudi in Rome), and as a consultant on applied-science issues for institutions such as ENEA, CISPEL and MIUR.\n\nMaffettone is most certainly among the Italian scholars with the strongest connections with foreign academic and scientific institutions. Several times he has been awarded a visiting professorship in the most prestigious American Universities (such as Harvard, NYU, Columbia, Tufts, Boston College). He was also a Senior Fellow “Ethics and Professions” program at Harvard University, and visiting professor in France (in the Maison des Sciences de l’Homme and at Sciences-Po in Paris), as well as in England (LSE) and in India. He has held lectures and courses in more than forty countries (just in the last two years in China, India, France, Great Britain, the United States, and Austria, to name a few), and he took part in many international conferences, publishing his contributions in the conference proceedings.\n\nMaffettone’s commitment to promote research programs with an international relevance is lastly manifest in creation of a doctoral program in Political Theory at LUISS, one of the first program taught in English, which sees the participation of many worldwide recognized scholars.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1875075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875075", "title": "Self-control", "text": "Self-control\n\nSelf-control, an aspect of inhibitory control, is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses. As an executive function, self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior in order to achieve specific goals.\n\nA related concept in psychology is emotional self-regulation. Self-control is like a muscle. According to studies, self-regulation, whether emotional or behavioral, was proven to be a limited resource which functions like energy. In the short term, overuse of self-control will lead to depletion. However, in the long term, the use of self-control can strengthen and improve over time.\n\nSelf-control is also a key concept in the general theory of crime, a major theory in criminology. The theory was developed by Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi in their book titled \"A General Theory of Crime\", published in 1990. Gottfredson and Hirschi define self-control as the differential tendency of individuals to avoid criminal acts independent of the situations in which they find themselves. Individuals with low self-control tend to be impulsive, insensitive towards others, risk takers, short-sighted, and nonverbal. The general theory of crime holds that self-control is established in early childhood through three major factors: the strength of the parent-to-child emotional bond, adequate supervision by parents, parents' ability to recognize punishable behavior, and appropriate discipline by parents.\n\nDesire is an affectively charged motivation toward a certain object, person, or activity, but not limited to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure. Desires vary in strength and duration. A desire becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the desire conflicts with an individual’s values or other self-regulatory goals. A limitation to research on desire is the issue of individuals desiring different things. New research looked at what people desire in real world settings. Over one week, 7,827 self-reports of desires were collected and indicated significant differences in desire frequency and strength, degree of conflict between desires and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting desire and success of the resistance. The most common and strongly experienced desires are those related to bodily needs like eating, drinking, and sleeping. This study has many implications related to self-control and the everyday things that interfere with people’s ability to stay on task. This is a big reason why self-control is considered to be a public speaker's worst nightmare.\n\nDesires that conflict with overarching goals or values are known as temptations. Self-control dilemmas occur when long-term goals and values clash with short-term temptations. Counteractive Self-Control Theory states that when presented with such a dilemma, we lessen the significance of the instant rewards while momentarily increasing the importance of our overall values. When asked to rate the perceived appeal of different snacks before making a decision, people valued health bars over chocolate bars. However, when asked to do the rankings after having chosen a snack, there was no significant difference of appeal. Further, when college students completed a questionnaire prior to their course registration deadline, they ranked leisure activities as less important and enjoyable than when they filled out the survey after the deadline passed. The stronger and more available the temptation is, the harsher the devaluation will be.\n\nOne of the most common self-control dilemmas involves the desire for unhealthy or unneeded food consumption versus the desire to maintain long-term health. An indication of unneeded food could also be over expenditure on certain types of consumption such as eating away from home. Not knowing how much to spend, or overspending one’s budget on eating out can be an symptom of a lack of self control. Experiment participants rated a new snack as significantly less healthy when it was described as very tasty compared to when they heard it was just slightly tasty. Without knowing anything else about a food, the mere suggestion of good taste triggers counteractive self-control and prompted them to devalue the temptation in the name of health. Further, when presented with the strong temptation of one large bowl of chips, participants both perceived the chips to be higher in calories and ate less of them than did participants who faced the weak temptation of three smaller chip bowls, even though both conditions represented the same amount of chips overall. Weak temptations are falsely perceived to be less unhealthy, so self-control is not triggered and desirable actions are more often engaged in, supporting the counteractive self-control theory. Weak temptations present more of a challenge to overcome than strong temptations, because they appear less likely to compromise long-term values.\n\nThe decrease in an individual's liking of and desire for a substance following repeated consumption of that substance is known as satiation. Satiation rates when eating depend on interactions of trait self-control and healthiness of the food. After eating equal amounts of either clearly healthy (raisins and peanuts) or unhealthy (M&Ms and Skittles) snack foods, people who scored higher on trait self-control tests reported feeling significantly less desire to eat more of the unhealthy foods than they did the healthy foods. Those with low trait self-control satiated at the same pace regardless of health value. Further, when reading a description emphasizing the sweet flavor of their snack, participants with higher trait self-control reported a decrease in desire faster than they did after hearing a description of the healthy benefits of their snack. Once again, those with low self-control satiated at the same rate regardless of health condition. Perceived unhealthiness of the food alone, regardless of actual health level, relates to faster satiation, but only for people with high trait self-control.\n\nThinking that is characterized by high construals, whenever individuals \"are obliged to infer additional details of content, context, or meaning in the actions and outcomes that unfold around them\", will view goals and values in a global, abstract sense. Whereas low level construals emphasize concrete, definitive ideas and categorizations. Different construal levels determine our activation of self-control in response to temptations. One technique for inducing high-level construals is asking an individual a series of \"why?\" questions that will lead to increasingly abstracted responses, whereas low-level construals are induced by \"how?\" questions leading to increasingly concrete answers. When taking an Implicit Association Test, people with induced high-level construals are significantly faster at associating temptations (such as candy bars) with \"bad,\" and healthy choices (such as apples) with \"good\" than those in the low-level condition. Further, higher-level construals also show a significantly increased likelihood of choosing an apple for snack over a candy bar. Without any conscious or active self-control efforts, temptations can be dampened by merely inducing high-level construals. It is suggested that the abstraction of high-level construals reminds people of their overall, lifelong values, such as a healthy lifestyle, which deemphasizes the current tempting situation.\n\nPositive correlation between linguistic capability and self-control has been inferred from experiments with common chimpanzees.\n\nHuman self-control research is typically modeled by using a token economy system. A token economy system is a behavioral program in which individuals in a group can earn tokens for a variety of desirable behaviors and can cash in the tokens for various backup, positive reinforcers. The difference in research methodologies with humans - using tokens or conditioned reinforcers versus non-humans using sub-primary forces suggested procedural artifacts as a possible suspect. One aspect of these procedural differences was the delay to the exchange period (Hyten et al. 1994). Non-human subjects can and most likely would access their reinforcement immediately. The human subjects had to wait for an \"exchange period\" in which they could exchange their tokens for money, usually at the end of the experiment. When this was done with the non-human subjects, in the form of pigeons, they responded much like humans in that males showed much less control than females. (Jackson & Hackenberg 1996). Logue, (1995), who is discussed more below, points out that in her study done on self-control it was male children who responded with less self-control than female children. She then states, that in adulthood, for the most part, the sexes equalize on their ability to exhibit self-control. This could imply a human's ability to exert more self-control as they mature and become aware of the consequences associated with impulsivity. This suggestion is further examined below.\n\nMost of the research in the field of self-control assumes that self-control is in general better than impulsiveness. As a result, almost all research done on this topic is from this standpoint and very rarely is impulsiveness the more adaptive response in experimental design.\n\nSelf-control is a measurable variable in humans. In the worst circumstances people with the most or high self-control and resilience have the best odds of defying the odds they are faced with, which could be poverty, bad schooling, unsafe communities, etc. Those at a disadvantage with high self-control go on to higher education and professional jobs, but this seems to have a negative effect on their health.\n\nWhen looking at people who come from advantage backgrounds with high self-control, we see a different phenomenon happening. Those who come from an advantaged background tend to be high-achieving and with their achievement comes good health. The psychological phenomenon known as “John Henryism” posits that when goal-oriented, success-minded people strive ceaselessly in the absence of adequate support and resources, they can—like the mighty 19th-century folk legend who fell dead of an aneurysm after besting a steam-powered drill in a railroad-spike-driving competition—work themselves to death. Or, at least, toward it. In the 1980s Sherman James a socio-epidemiologist from North Carolina found that black Americans in the state suffered disproportionately from heart disease and strokes. He too landed on \"John Henryism\" as the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nMore recently some in the field of developmental psychology have begun to think of self-control in a more complicated way that takes into account that sometimes impulsiveness is the more adaptive response. In their view, a normal individual should have the capacity to be either impulsive or controlled depending on which is the most adaptive. However, this is a recent shift in paradigm and there is little research conducted along these lines.\n\nB.F. Skinner's \"Science and Human Behavior\" provides a survey of nine categories of self-control methods.\n\nThe manipulation of the environment to make some responses easier to physically execute and others more difficult illustrate this principle. This can be referred to as physical guidance which is the application of physical contact to induce an individual to go through the motions of a desired behavior. This concept can also be referred to as a physical prompt. Examples of this include clapping one’s hand over one’s own mouth, placing one’s hand in one’s pocket to prevent fidgeting, and using a ‘bridge’ hand position to steady a pool shot all represent physical methods to affect behavior.\n\nManipulating the occasion for behavior may change behavior as well. Removing distractions that induce undesired actions or adding a prompt to induce it are examples. Hiding temptation and reminders are two more. The need to hide temptation is a result of its effect on the mind. A common theme among studies of desire is an investigation of the underlying cognitive processes of a craving for an addictive substance, such as nicotine or alcohol. In order to better understand the cognitive processes involved, the Elaborated Intrusion (EI) theory of craving was developed. According to the EI theory, craving persists because individuals develop mental images of the coveted substance that are instantly pleasurable, but which also increase their awareness of deficit. The result is a cruel circle of desire, imagery, and preparation to satisfy the desire. This quickly escalates into greater expression of the imagery that incorporates working memory, interferes with performance on simultaneous cognitive tasks, and strengthens the emotional response. Essentially the mind is consumed by the craving for a desired substance, and this craving in turn interrupts any concurrent cognitive tasks. Obviously a craving for nicotine or alcohol is an extreme case, but nevertheless the EI theory holds true for more normal motivations and desires.\n\nDeprivation is the time in which an individual does not receive a reinforcer, while satiation occurs when an individual has received a reinforcer to such a degree that it will temporarily have no reinforcing power over them. If we deprive ourselves of a stimulus, the value of that reinforcement increases. For example, if an individual has been deprived of food, they may go to extreme measures to get that food, such as stealing. On the other hand, when we have an exceeding amount of a reinforcer, that reinforcement loses its value; if an individual eats a large meal, they may no longer be enticed by the reinforcement of dessert.\n\nOne may manipulate one's own behavior by affecting states of deprivation or satiation. By skipping a meal before a free dinner one may more effectively capitalize on the free meal. By eating a healthy snack beforehand the temptation to eat free \"junk food\" is reduced.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the importance of imagery in desire cognition during a state of deprivation. A study conducted on this topic involved smokers divided into two groups. The control group was instructed to continue smoking as usual until they arrived at the laboratory, where they were then asked to read a multisensory neutral script, meaning it was not related to a craving for nicotine. The experimental group, however, was asked to abstain from smoking before coming to the laboratory in order to induce craving and upon their arrival were told to read a multisensory urge-induction script intended to intensify their nicotine craving. Once the participants finished reading the script they rated their craving for cigarettes. Next they formulated visual or auditory images when prompted with verbal cues such as \"a game of tennis\" or \"a telephone ringing.\" After this task the participants again rated their craving for cigarettes. The study found that the craving experienced by the abstaining smokers was decreased to the control group's level by visual imagery but not by auditory imagery alone. That mental imagery served to reduce the level of craving in smokers illustrates that it can be used as a method of self-control during times of deprivation.\n\nWe manipulate emotional conditions in order to induce certain ways of responding. One example of this can be seen in theatre. Actors often elicit tears from painful memories if it is necessary for the character they are playing. This idea is similar to the notion if we read a letter, book, listen to music, watch a movie, in order to get us in the \"mood\" so we can be in the proper state of mind for a certain event or function. Additionally, treating an activity as \"work\" or \"fun\" can have an effect on the difficulty of self-control.\n\nIn order to analyze the possible effects of the cognitive transformation of an object on desire, a study was conducted based on a well-known German chocolate product. The study involved 71 undergraduate students, all of whom were familiar with the chocolate product. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control condition, the consummatory condition, and the nonconsummatory transformation condition. Each group was then given three minutes to complete their assigned task. The participants in the control condition were told to read a neutral article about a location in South America that was devoid of any words associated with food consumption. Those in the consummatory condition were instructed to imagine as clearly as possible how consuming the chocolate would taste and feel. The participants in the nonconsummatory transformation condition were told to imagine as clearly as possible odd settings or uses for the chocolate. Next, all the participants underwent a manipulation task that required them to rate their mood on a five-point scale in response to ten items they viewed. Following the manipulation task, participants completed automatic evaluations that measured their reaction time to six different images of the chocolate, each of which was paired with a positive or a negative stimuli. The results showed that the participants instructed to imagine the consumption of the chocolate demonstrated higher automatic evaluations toward the chocolate than did the participants told to imagine odd settings or uses for the chocolate, and participants in the control condition fell in-between the two experimental conditions. This indicates that the manner in which one considers an item influences how much it is desired.\n\nAversive stimulation is used as a means of increasing or decreasing the likelihood of target behavior. Similar to all methods of self-management, there is a controlling response, and a controlled response. An averse stimuli is sometimes referred to as a punisher or simply an aversive. Closely related to the idea of a punisher is the concept of punishment. Punishment is the idea that in a given situation, someone does something that is immediately followed by a punisher, then that person is less likely to do the same thing again when she or he next encounters a similar situation. An example of this can be seen when a teenage stays out past curfew. After staying out past curfew the teenagers parents ground the teenager. Because the teenager has been punished for his or her behavior he or she is less likely to stay out past their curfew again, thus decreasing the likelihood of the target behavior.\n\nCertain types of drugs affect self-controls. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, improve inhibitory control in general and are used to treat ADHD. Similarly, depressants, such as alcohol, represent barriers to self-control through sluggishness, slower brain function, poor concentration, depression and disorientation.\n\nOperant conditioning sometimes referred to as Skinnerian conditioning is the process of strengthening a behavior by reinforcing it or weakening it by punishing it. By continually strengthening and reinforcing a behavior, or weakening and punishing a behavior an association as well as a consequence is made. Similarly, a behavior that is altered by its consequences is known as operant behavior There are multiple components of operant conditioning; these include reinforcement such as positive reinforcers and negative reinforcers. A positive reinforcer is a stimulus which, when presented immediately following a behavior, causes the behavior to increase in frequency. Negative reinforcers are a stimulus whose removal immediately after a response cause the response to be strengthened or to increase in frequency. Additionally, components of punishment are also incorporated such as positive punishment and negative punishment. Examples of operant conditioning can be seen every day. When a student tells a joke to one of his peers and they all laugh at this joke, this student is more likely to continue this behavior of telling jokes because his joke was reinforced by the sound of their laughing. However, if a peer tells the student his joke is \"silly\" or \"stupid\", he will be punished by telling the joke and his likelihood to tell another joke is greatly decreased. Another example of operant conditioning can be seen in the form of quitting a habit such as smoking. By using this technique to quit smoking, self-discipline must be displayed as the smoker must stop giving into their addiction.\n\nSelf-punishment of responses would include the arranging of punishment contingent upon undesired responses. This might be seen in the behavior of whipping oneself which some monks and religious persons do. This is different from aversive stimulation in that, for example, the alarm clock generates escape from the alarm, while self-punishment presents stimulation after the fact to reduce the probability of future behavior.\n\nPunishment is more like conformity than self-control because with self-control there needs to be an internal drive, not an external source of punishment that makes the person want to do something. There is external locus of control which is similar to determinism and there is internal locus of control which is similar to free will. With a learning system of punishment the person does not make their decision based upon what they want, rather they base it on the external factors. When you use a negative reinforcement you are more likely to influence their internal decisions and allow them to make the choice on their own whereas with a punishment the person will make their decisions based upon the consequences and not exert self-control. The best way to learn self-control is with free will where people are able to perceive they are making their own choices.\n\nSkinner noted that various philosophies and religions exemplified this principle by instructing believers to love their enemies. When we are filled with rage or hatred we might control ourselves by 'doing something else' or more specifically something that is incompatible with our response.\n\nFunctional imaging of the brain has shown that self-control is correlated with an area in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a part of the frontal lobe. This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives. This control occurs through the top-down inhibition of premotor cortex. There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, researchers believed the bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains control of working memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism. Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity.\n\nThere are many researchers working on identifying the brain areas involved in the exertion of self-control; many different areas are known to be involved. In relation to self-control mechanisms, the reward centers in the brain compare external stimuli versus internal need states and a person’s learning history. At the biological level, a loss of control is thought to be caused by a malfunctioning of a decision mechanism. A mechanistic explanation of self-control is still in its infancy. However, there is strong demand for knowledge about these mechanism because knowledge of these mechanisms would have tremendous clinical application.\nMuch of the work on how the brain reaches decisions is based on evidence from perceptual learning.\n\nMany of the tasks that subjects are tested on are not tasks typically associated with self-control, but are more general decision tasks. Nevertheless, the research on self-control is informed by more general research on decision tasks. Sources for evidence on the neural mechanisms of self-control include fMRI studies on human subject, neural recordings on animals, lesion studies on humans and animals, and clinical behavioral studies on humans with self-control disorders.\n\nThere is broad agreement that the cortex is involved in self-control. The details of the final model have yet to be worked out. However, there are some enticing findings that suggest a mechanistic account of self-control could prove to have tremendous explanatory value. What follows is a survey of some of the important recent literature on the brain regions involved in self-control.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is located in the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe in the brain. It forms a larger portion of the cortex in humans. The dendrites in the prefrontal cortex contain up to 16 times as many dendritic spines as neurons in other cortical areas. Due to this, the prefrontal cortex integrates a large amount of information. The orbitofrontal cortex cells are important factors for self-control. If an individual has the choice between an immediate reward or a more valuable reward which they can receive later, an individual would most likely try to control the impulse to take that immediate reward. If an individual has a damaged orbitofrontal cortex, this impulse control will most likely not be as strong, and they may be more likely to take the immediate reinforcement. Additionally, we see lack of impulse control in children because the prefrontal cortex develops slowly.\n\nTodd A. Hare \"et al.\" use functional MRI techniques to show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are crucially involved in the exertion of self-control. They found that activity in the vmPFC was correlated with goal values and that the exertion of self-control required the modulation of the vmPFC by the DLPFC. The study found that a lack of self-control was strongly correlated with reduced activity in the DLPFC. Hare’s study is especially relevant to the self-control literature because it suggests that an important cause of poor self-control is a defective DLPFC.\n\nAlexandra W. Logue is interested in how outcomes change the possibilities of a self-control choice being made. Logue identifies three possible outcome effects: outcome delays, outcome size, and outcome contingencies. The delay of an outcome results in the perception that the outcome is less valuable than an outcome which is more readily achieved. The devaluing of the delayed outcome can cause less self-control. A way to increase self-control in situations of a delayed outcome is to pre-expose an outcome. Pre-exposure reduces the frustrations related to the delay of the outcome. An example of this is signing bonuses.\n\nOutcome size deals with the relative, perceived size of possible outcomes. There tends to be a relationship between the value of the incentive and the desired outcome; the larger the desired outcome, the larger the value. Some factors that decrease value include delay, effort/cost, and uncertainty. The decision tends to be based on the option with the higher value at the time of the decision.\n\nFinally, Logue defines the relationship between responses and outcomes as outcome contingencies. Outcome contingencies also impact the degree of self-control that a person exercises. For instance, if a person is able to change his choice after the initial choice is made, the person is far more likely to take the impulsive, rather than self-controlled, choice. Additionally, it is possible for people to make precommitment action. A precommitment action is an action meant to lead to a self-controlled action at a later period in time. When a person sets an alarm clock, they are making a precommitted response to wake up early in the morning. Hence, that person is more likely to exercise the self-controlled decision to wake up, rather than to fall back in bed for a little more sleep.\n\nCassandra B. Whyte studied locus of control and academic performance and determined that internals tend to achieve at a higher level. Internals may perceive they have options from which to choose, thus facilitating more hopeful decision-making behavior as opposed to dependence on externally determined outcomes that require less commitment, effort, or self-control.\n\nMany things affect one's ability to exert self-control, but it seems that self-control requires sufficient glucose levels in the brain. Exerting self-control depletes glucose. Reduced glucose, and poor glucose tolerance (reduced ability to transport glucose to the brain) are correlated with lower performance in tests of self-control, particularly in difficult new situations. Self-control demands that an individual work to overcome thoughts, emotions, and automatic responses/impulses. These strong efforts require higher blood glucose levels. Lower blood glucose levels can lead to unsuccessful self-control abilities. Alcohol causes a decrease of glucose levels in both the brain and the body, and it also has an impairing effect on many forms of self-control. Furthermore, failure of self-control occurs most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose.\n\nAn alternative explanation of the limited amounts of glucose that are found is that this depends on the allocation of glucose, not on limited supply of glucose. According to this theory, the brain has sufficient resources of glucose and also has the possibility of delivering the glucose, but the personal priorities and motivations of the individual cause the glucose to be allocated to other sites. This theory has not been tested yet.\n\nIn the 1960s, Walter Mischel tested four-year-old children for self-control in \"The Marshmallow Test\": the children were each given a marshmallow and told that they can eat it anytime they want, but if they waited 15 minutes, they would receive another marshmallow. Follow up studies showed that the results correlated well with these children's success levels in later life.\n\nA strategy used in the marshmallow test was the focus on \"hot\" and \"cool\" features of an object. The children were encouraged to think about the marshmallow's \"cool features\" such as its shape and texture, possibly comparing it to a cotton ball or a cloud. The \"hot features\" of the marshmallow would be its sweet, sticky tastiness. These hot features make it more difficult to delay gratification. By focusing on the cool features, the mind is adverted from the appealing aspects of the marshmallow, and self-control is more plausible.\n\nYears later Dr. Mischel reached out to the participants of his study who were then in their 40's. He found that those who showed less self-control by taking the single marshmallow in the initial study were more likely to develop problems with relationships, stress, and drug abuse later in life. Dr. Mischel carried out the experiment again with the same participants in order to see which parts of the brain were active during the process of self-control. The participants received scans through M.R.I to show brain activity. The results showed that those who exhibited lower levels of self-control had higher brain activity in the ventral striatum, the area that deals with positive rewards.\n\nReviews concluded that self-control is correlated with various positive life outcomes, such as happiness, adjustment and various positive psychological factors. Self-control was also negatively correlated with sociotropy which in turn is correlated with depression.\n\nThere's conflicting evidence about whether will power is finite, infinite or self-reinforcing resource, a phenomenon sometimes termed ego depletion or reverse ego depletion . However, belief that will-power is infinite or self-reinforcing is associated with greater will power, voluntary executive function.\n\nExerting self-control through the executive functions in decision making is held in some theories to deplete one's ability to do so in the future. Ego depletion is the view that high self-control requires energy and focus, and over an extended period of self-control demands, this self-control can lessen. There are ways to help this ego depletion. One way is through rest and relaxation from these high demands. Additionally, training self-control with certain behaviors can also help to strengthen an individual’s self-control. This seems to be particularly effective in those who would otherwise have difficulty controlling their impulses in the domain of interest. Another way to overcome unwanted desires is to change the method with which we approach desire. One study in particular analyzed the impact of approaching a temptation by defining it in abstract, general terms as opposed to specific, concrete details. For the purposes of the study, approaching a situation using general terms was defined as the high-level construal condition whereas using specific details was termed the low-level construal condition. The study involved 42 college students who were randomly assigned to either the high-level or low-level construal condition. The participants were then presented with a packet that described five scenarios, each one involving a unique self-control conflict. For those participants in the high-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only general terms and for those in the low-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only specific details. After imagining themselves in each scenario, the participants were asked to indicate how bad they would feel if they indulged in the temptation using a six-point scale ranging from \"not at all bad\" to \"very bad.\" The data showed that participants in the high-level construal condition reported greater negative evaluations of temptations than did participants in the low-level construal conditions. This implies that individuals using high-level construals are better able to place a temptation in context and properly evaluate its long-term impact, and therefore are more likely to maintain self-control.\n\nKelly McGonigal defines willpower as \"the ability to do what you really want to do when part of you really doesn’t want to do it.\" It consists of three competing elements: 1) I will – the ability to do what you need to do; 2) I won’t – the other side of self-control; the ability to resist temptation; and 3) I want – your true want, the ability to remember the big picture of your life. Willpower is a resource that gets depleted, particularly when you are rundown or hungry. However, you may increase your capacity for willpower by engaging in activities such as mindfulness, meditation and exercise and/or by ensuring good nutrition and adequate sleep.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23475401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23475401", "title": "Sri Aurobindo", "text": "Sri Aurobindo\n\nSri Aurobindo (born Aurobindo Ghose; 15 August 1872 – 5 December 1950) was an Indian philosopher, yogi, guru, poet, and nationalist. He joined the Indian movement for independence from British rule, for a while was one of its influential leaders and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and spiritual evolution.\n\nAurobindo studied for the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and became increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, but in a highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail, he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.\n\nDuring his stay in Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a method of spiritual practice he called Integral Yoga. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life divine. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated man but transformed his nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (referred to as \"The Mother\"), he founded the Sri Aurobindo Ashram.\n\nHis main literary works are \"The Life Divine\", which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; \"Synthesis of Yoga\", which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and \"\", an epic poem. His works also include philosophy, poetry, translations and commentaries on the \"Vedas\", \"Upanishads\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\". He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1943 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.\n\nAurobindo Ghose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Bengal Presidency, India on 15 August 1872 in a Bengali Kayastha family that was associated with the village of Konnagar in the Hoogly district. His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then Assistant Surgeon of Rangpur in Bengal, and a former member of the Brahmo Samaj religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of evolution while pursuing medical studies in Edinburgh. His mother was Swarnalata Devi, whose father was Shri Rajnarayan Bose, a leading figure in the Samaj. She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo's birth. Aurobindo had two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and Manmohan, a younger sister, Sarojini, and a younger brother, Barindrakumar (also referred to as Barin).\n\nYoung Aurobindo was brought up speaking English but used Hindustani to communicate with servants. Although his family were Bengali, his father believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English-speaking Loreto House boarding school in Darjeeling, in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.\n\nKrishna Dhun Ghose wanted his sons to enter the Indian Civil Service (ICS), an elite organisation comprising around 1000 people. To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England and so it was there that the entire family moved in 1879. The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in Manchester. Drewett was a minister of the Congregational Church whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangapur.\n\nThe boys were taught Latin by Drewett and his wife. This was a prerequisite for admission to good English schools and, after two years, in 1881, the elder two siblings were enrolled at Manchester Grammar School. Aurobindo was considered too young for enrolment and he continued his studies with the Drewetts, learning history, Latin, French, geography and arithmetic. Although the Drewetts were told not to teach religion, the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him. There was little contact with his father, who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England, but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been, on one occasion describing the British Raj as a \"heartless government\".\n\nDrewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined St Paul's School there. He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading literature and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic. A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in Shepherd's Bush, London, from 1884 to 1887. The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, Henry Cotton.\n\nBy 1889, Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations but to do so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.\n\nAt this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was travelling in England. Cotton secured for him a place in Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince. He left England for India, arriving there in February 1893. In India, Krishna Dhun Ghose, who was waiting to receive his son, was misinformed by his agents from Bombay (now Mumbai) that the ship on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk off the coast of Portugal. His father died upon hearing this news.\n\nIn Baroda, Aurobindo joined the state service in 1893, working first in the Survey and Settlements department, later moving to the Department of Revenue and then to the Secretariat, and much miscellaneous work like teaching grammar and assisting in writing speeches for the Maharaja of Gaekwad until 1897. In 1897 during his work in Baroda, he started working as a part-time French teacher at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda). He was later promoted to the post of vice-principal. At Baroda, Aurobindo self-studied Sanskrit and Bengali.\n\nDuring his stay at Baroda, he contributed to many articles to \"Indu Prakash\" and spoke as a chairman of the Baroda college board. He started taking an active interest in the politics of India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from an overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, while traveling to these states. He established contact with Lokmanya Tilak and Sister Nivedita.\n\nAurobindo often travelled between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parent's families and other Bengali relatives, including his sister Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increased to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the Partition of Bengal. In 1901, on a visit to Calcutta, he married 14-year-old Mrinalini, the daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service. Aurobindo was 28 at that time. Mrinalini died seventeen years later in December 1918 during the influenza pandemic.\n\nAurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured non-co-operation and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.\n\nIn Bengal, with Barin's help, he established contacts with revolutionaries, inspiring radicals such as Bagha Jatin or Jatin Mukherjee and Surendranath Tagore. He helped establish a series of youth clubs, including the Anushilan Samiti of Calcutta in 1902.\n\nAurobindo attended the 1906 Congress meeting headed by Dadabhai Naoroji and participated as a councillor in forming the fourfold objectives of \"Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott and national education\". In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, he led along with extremists along with Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The Congress split after this session. In 1907–1908 Aurobindo travelled extensively to Pune, Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the Alipore Bomb Case. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial, following the murder of chief prosecution witness Naren Gosain within jail premises which subsequently led to the case against him collapsing. Aurobindo was subsequently released after a year of isolated incarceration.\n\nOnce out of the prison he started two new publications, \"Karmayogin\" in English and \"Dharma\" in Bengali. He also delivered the hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters. The British persecution continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, where Britain's secret police monitored his activities.\n\nIn July 1905 then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, partitioned Bengal. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually, he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was Chittaranjan Das.\n\nDuring this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. \n\nAurobindo said he was \"visited\" by Vivekananda in the Alipore Jail: \"It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence.\"\n\nIn his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of Brahmananda. In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.\n\nIn 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at Chandannagar in the house of Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in \"Karmayogin\". As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.\n\nIn Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called \"Arya\". This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication was \"The Life Divine\", \"The Synthesis of Yoga\", \"Essays on The Gita\", \"The Secret of The Veda\", \"Hymns to the Mystic Fire\", \"The Upanishads\", \"The Renaissance in India\", \"War and Self-determination\", \"The Human Cycle\", \"The Ideal of Human Unity\" and \"The Future Poetry\" were published in this magazine.\n\nAt the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1926. From 1926 he started to sign himself as \"Sri Aurobindo\", \"Sri\" (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an honorific.\n\nFor some time afterwards, his main literary output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, most of which were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousand. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of \"Letters on Yoga.\" In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem for the rest of his life. It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, \"Savitri\", an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.\n\nSri Aurobindo died on 5 December 1950. Around 60,000 people attended to see his body resting peacefully. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and the President Rajendra Prasad praised him for his contribution to Yogic philosophy and the independence movement. National and international newspapers commemorated his death.\n\nSri Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (b. Alfassa), came to be known as \"The Mother\". She was a French national, born in Paris on 21 February 1878. In her 20s she studied occultism with Max Theon. Along with her husband, Paul Richard, she went to Pondicherry on 29 March 1914, and finally settled there in 1920. Sri Aurobindo considered her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Sri Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, build and run the ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Sometime later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, she continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.\n\nSri Aurobindo's concept of the Integral Yoga system is described in his books, \"The Synthesis of Yoga\" and \"The Life Divine\". \"The Life Divine\" is a compilation of essays published serially in \"Arya.\"\n\nSri Aurobindo argues that divine \"Brahman\" manifests as empirical reality through \"līlā,\" or divine play. Instead of posting that the world we experience is an illusion (\"māyā\")\",\" Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species.\n\nSri Aurobindo believed that Darwinism merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, but does not explain the reason behind it, while he finds life to be already present in matter, because all of existence is a manifestation of \"Brahman\". He argues that nature (which he interpreted as divine) has evolved life out of matter and the mind out of life. All of existence, he argues, is attempting to manifest to the level of the supermind – that evolution had a purpose. He stated that he found the task of understanding the nature of reality arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results.\n\nIn his writings, talks and letters Sri Aurobindo has referred to several European philosophers with whose basic concepts he was familiar, commenting on their ideas and discussing the question of affinity to his own line of thought. Thus he wrote a long essay on the Greek philosopher Heraclitus and mentioned especially Plato, Plotinus, Nietzsche and Bergson as thinkers in whom he was interested because of their more intuitive approach. On the other hand, he felt little attraction for the philosophy of Kant or Hegel. Several studies have shown a remarkable closeness to the evolutionary thought of Teilhard de Chardin, whom he did not know, whereas the latter came to know of Sri Aurobindo at a late stage. After reading some chapters of \"The Life Divine\", he is reported to have said that Sri Aurobindo’s vision of evolution was basically the same as his own, though stated for Asian readers. \n\nSeveral scholars have discovered significant similarities in the thought of Sri Aurobindo and Hegel. Steve Odin has discussed this subject comprehensively in a comparative study. Odin writes that Sri Aurobindo \"has appropriated Hegel’s notion of an Absolute Spirit and employed it to radically restructure the architectonic framework of the ancient Hindu Vedanta system in contemporary terms.\" In his analysis Odin arrives at the conclusion that \"both philosophers similarly envision world creation as the progressive self-manifestation and evolutionary ascent of a universal consciousness in its journey toward Self-realization.\" He points out that in contrast to the deterministic and continuous dialectal unfolding of Absolute Reason by the mechanism of thesis-antithesis-synthesis or affirmation-negation-integration, \"Sri Aurobindo argues for a creative, emergent mode of evolution.\" In his résumé Odin states that Sri Aurobindo has overcome the ahistorical world-vision of traditional Hinduism and presented a concept which allows for a genuine advance and novelty.\n\nAlthough Sri Aurobindo was familiar with the most important lines of thought in Western philosophy, he did not acknowledge their influence on his own writings. He wrote that his philosophy \"was formed first by the study of the Upanishads and the Gita… They were the basis of my first practice of Yoga.\" With the help of his readings he tried to move on to actual experience, \"and it was on this experience that later on I founded my philosophy, not on ideas themselves.” \n\nHe assumes that the seers of the Upanishads had basically the same approach and gives some details of his vision of the past in a long passage in \"The Renaissance of India\". \"The Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of numerous profound philosophies and religions,\" he writes. Even Buddhism with all its developments was only a \"restatement\" from a new standpoint and with fresh terms. And, furthermore the ideas of the Upanishads \"can be rediscovered in much of the thought of Pythagoras and Plato and form the profoundest part of Neo-platonism and Gnosticism…\" Finally, the larger part of German metaphysics \"is little more in substance than an intellectual development of great realities more spiritually seen in this ancient teaching.\" When once he was asked by a disciple whether Plato got some of his ideas from Indian books, he responded that though something of the philosophy of India got through \"by means of Pythagoras and others\", he assumed that Plato got most of his ideas from intuition.\n\nSri Aurobindo’s indebtedness to the Indian tradition also becomes obvious through his placing a large number of quotations from the Rig Veda, the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita at the beginning of the chapters in \"The Life Divine\", showing the connection of his own thought to Veda and Vedanta.\n\nThe \"Isha Upanishad\" is considered to be one of the most important and more accessible writings of Sri Aurobindo. Before he published his final translation and analysis, he wrote ten incomplete commentaries. In a key passage he points out that the Brahman or Absolute is both the Stable and the Moving. \"We must see it in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the changing manifestations of universe and relativity.\" Sri Aurobindo’s biographer K.R.S. Iyengar quotes R.S. Mugali as stating that Sri Aurobindo might have obtained in this Upanishad the thought-seed which later grew into \"The Life Divine\".\n\nSisir Kumar Maitra, who was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo’s Philosophy, has referred to the issue of external influences and written that Sri Aurobindo does not mention names, but \"as one reads his books one cannot fail to notice how thorough is his grasp of the great Western philosophers of the present age…\" Although he is Indian one should not \"underrate the influence of Western thought upon him. This influence is there, very clearly visible, but Sri Aurobindo... has not allowed himself to be dominated by it. He has made full use of Western thought, but he has made use of it for the purpose of building up his own system…\" Thus Maitra, like Steve Odin, sees Sri Aurobindo not only in the tradition and context of Indian, but also Western philosophy and assumes he may have adopted some elements from the latter for his synthesis.\n\nR. Puligandla supports this viewpoint in his title \"Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy\". He describes Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy as \"an original synthesis of the Indian and Western traditions.\" \"He integrates in a unique fashion the great social, political and scientific achievements of the modern West with the ancient and profound spiritual insights of Hinduism. The vision that powers the life divine of Aurobindo is none other than the Upanishadic vision of the unity of all existence.\" \n\nPuligandla believes that the Western influence also becomes evident through Sri Aurobindo’s critical position vis-à-vis Shankara and his assumption that the latter teaches through his Mayavada or Illusionism that the world is unreal and illusory. Puligandla objects, \"nowhere does Shankara say that the world is unreal and illusory. Quite the contrary, through the concept of sublation he teaches that the world is neither real nor unreal. That this is indeed his teaching is further borne out by his distinction between lower and higher truths.\" Therefore, Puligandla concludes that \"Aurobindo’s characterization of Shankara’s Vedanta as a world-negating philosophy is unfounded.\" He believes that Sri Aurobindo in his endeavour to synthesize Hindu and Western modes of thought has wrongly identified Shankara’s Mayavada with the subjective idealism of George Berkeley, \"which undoubtedly stands in sharp contrast to the realism of the Western philosophical tradition in general.\" Nonetheless, Puligandla believes that Sri Aurobindo was \"a great philosopher-mystic\" with a significant vision of man and the world.\n\nSri Aurobindo’s critique of Shankara is supported by U. C. Dubey in his paper titled \"Integralism: The Distinctive Feature of Sri Aurobindo’s Philosophy.\" He starts by summarizing what he considers to be Sri Aurobindo’s most important contributions to philosophy and mentions at first his integral view of Reality. \"The creative force or 'cit-śakti' is regarded by him as one with the Absolute. Thus there is no opposition between the Absolute and its creative force in his system.\" Next Dubey refers to Sri Aurobindo’s conception of the supermind as the mediatory principle between the Absolute and the finite world and quotes S.K. Maitra stating that this conception \"is the pivot round which the whole of Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy moves.\" \n\nDubey proceeds to analyse the approach of the Shankarites and believes that they follow an inadequate kind of logic that does not do justice to the challenge of tackling the problem of the Absolute, which cannot be known by finite reason. With the help of the finite reason, he says, \"we are bound to determine the nature of reality as one or many, being or becoming. But Sri Aurobindo’s Integral Advaitism reconciles all apparently different aspects of Existence in an all-embracing unity of the Absolute.\" Next, Dubey explains that for Sri Aurobindo there is a higher reason, the \"logic of the infinite\" in which his integralism is rooted, and expounds this concept by presenting some quotations from \"The Life Divine\". In concluding he notes critically \"that Sri Aurobindo does not explain sufficiently the nature of the logic of the infinite.\" Nevertheless, \"the way he proposes this logic is undoubtedly his unique contribution in the field of Absolutism.\"\n\nSri Aurobindo was an Indian nationalist but is best known for his philosophy on human evolution and Integral Yoga.\n\nHis influence has been wide-ranging. In India, S. K. Maitra, Anilbaran Roy and D. P. Chattopadhyaya commented on Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on esotericism and traditional wisdom, such as Mircea Eliade, Paul Brunton, and Rene Guenon, all saw him as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.\n\nHaridas Chaudhuri and Frederic Spiegelberg were among those who were inspired by Aurobindo, who worked on the newly formed American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. Soon after, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship, from which later emerged the California Institute of Integral Studies.\n\nSri Aurobindo has influenced Subash Chandra Bose to take an initiative of dedicating to Indian National Movement fulltime. Bose writes \"The illustrious example of Arabindo Ghosh looms large before my vision. I feel that I am ready to make the sacrifice which that example demands of me. \" \n\nKarlheinz Stockhausen was heavily inspired by Satprem's writings about Sri Aurobindo during a week in May 1968, a time at which the composer was undergoing a personal crisis and had found Sri Aurobindo's philosophies were relevant to his feelings. After this experience, Stockhausen's music took a completely different turn, focusing on mysticism, that was to continue until the end of his career.\n\nJean Gebser has acknowledged Sri Aurobindo's influence on his work and referred to him several times in his writings. Thus, in \"The Invisible Origin\" he quotes a long passage from \"The Synthesis of Yoga\". Gebser believes that he was \"in some way brought into the extremely powerful spiritual field of force radiating through Sri Aurobindo.\" In his title \"Asia Smiles Differently\" he reports about his visit to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and meeting with the Mother whom he calls an \"exceptionally gifted person.\"\n\nWilliam Irwin Thompson travelled to Auroville in 1972, where he met \"The Mother\". Thompson has called Sri Aurobindo's teaching on spirituality a \"radical anarchism\" and a \"post-religious approach\" and regards their work as having \"... reached back into the Goddess culture of prehistory, and, in Marshall McLuhan's terms, 'culturally retrieved' the archetypes of the shaman and \"la sage femme\"... \" Thompson also writes that he experienced Shakti, or psychic power coming from The Mother on the night of her death in 1973.\n\nSri Aurobindo's ideas about the further evolution of human capabilities influenced the thinking of Michael Murphy – and indirectly, the human potential movement, through Murphy's writings.\n\nThe American philosopher Ken Wilber has called Sri Aurobindo \"India's greatest modern philosopher sage\" and has integrated some of his ideas into his philosophical vision. Wilber's interpretation of Aurobindo has been criticised by Rod Hemsell. New Age writer Andrew Harvey also looks to Sri Aurobindo as a major inspiration.\n\nThe following authors, disciples and organisations trace their intellectual heritage back to, or have in some measure been influenced by, Sri Aurobindo and The Mother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

His next career steps included being an \"Other Resource Assistant\", and a Silviculturalist (an individual who is responsible for timber harvesting and reforestation plans). He eventually became a Forester on six Ranger Districts, including districts in Kentucky and Mississippi, managing the growth of different trees and monitoring their health. From there he moved on to become District Ranger at the Talladega National Forest in Alabama, the Oconee National Forest in Georgia, and the DeSoto National Forest in Mississippi. After that, he served as Deputy Forest Supervisor for the National Forests in Florida.\n\nSince 2006, Tony Tooke also held increasingly senior positions in the Forest Service’s Washington Office (WO). In September of that year, he took over the position of Assistant Director for Forest Management. In this function, he became closely acquainted with questions of ecological restoration, climate change, and integrative vegetation management. Since March 2009, he served as Deputy Director for Economic Recovery. In December 2009, he became the Director for Ecosystem Management Coordination, where it was his job to manage the lands and resources of the National Forest System.\nHis last position in Washington, D.C., before becoming Service Chief, was Associate Deputy Chief for the National Forest System. In this capacity, he oversaw numerous work areas of the Forest Service, including the Lands and Realties the agency has been entrusted with, but also less obvious aspects such as Minerals and Geology. Furthermore, his obligations included the oversight of cooperation efforts with state rural development councils through the National Partnership Office as well as the coordination of ecosystems management and the Forest Service’s efforts for the conservation of wilderness areas and wild scenic rivers. In addition, he also was responsible for oversight of bureaucratic necessities such as Business Administration and Support Services. As Associate Deputy Chief, Tooke was also in charge of the Forest Service’s programs for Environmental Justice and the implementation of the 2014 Agricultural Act, commonly known as the \"Farm Bill\", which helps the Forest Service to accomplish some of its core missions, such as ecological restoration and reducing risks of wildland fires. Yet another facet of Tony Tooke’s work was to implement the Forest Service’s strategy to improve the agency’s awareness of the state of its inventory, as well as the work of its usually widely dispersed employees, and the implementation of a new planning rule for the National Forest System.\n\nAfter Tooke's assignment in the WO, he became Regional Forester for the Forest Service’s Southern Region, also known as Region 8, headquartered in Atlanta, GA. The Southern Regional Office manages forests and lands of 13 States as well as Puerto Rico. In a ceremony at White Mountain National Forest on 2 September 2017, Tooke took an oath of office from the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, thereby making Tooke the 18th Chief of the U.S. Forest Service. New Hampshire's Governor, Chris Sununu, and members of the US Forest Service also attended the ceremony. Tooke succeeded the longtime Chief of the Forest Service Thomas Tidwell.\nThe new Chief took over an agency that oversees 154 national forests, as well as 20 grasslands in 43 states and Puerto Rico. One of his premier tasks will be to lead the fight against wildland fires which consume more than half of the Forest Services financial resources, topping $2 billion in 2017. The agency, as Tooke said in a statement in September 2017, also appreciates the help it receives from Congress to develop more effective tools for firefighting. Another task for the person in this position will be to manage U.S. public forests effectively and to cooperate well with authorities on both state and local levels.\n\nOn March 2, 2018, the U.S. Forest Service confirmed that the United States Department of Agriculture has \"engaged an independent investigator\" to evaluate claims of sexual misconduct against Tooke. Tooke announced his immediate retirement on March 7, 2018.\n\nTooke holds a bachelor's degree in forestry from Mississippi State University (1983). He was a member of the inaugural class of the Unites States Forest Service’s \"Senior Leadership Program\". He has also completed the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program.\n\nTooke grew up on a small 200-acre farm in Detroit, Alabama.\n\n"}
{"id": "596818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=596818", "title": "Tractatus Theologico-Politicus", "text": "Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\n\nWritten by the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (TTP) or Theologico-Political Treatise was one of the most controversial texts of the early modern period. It was a preemptive defense of Spinoza's later work, \"Ethics\", published posthumously in 1677, for which he anticipated harsh criticism.\n\nThe treatise was published anonymously in 1670 by Jan Rieuwertsz in Amsterdam. In order to protect the author and publisher from political retribution, the title page identified the city of publication as Hamburg and the publisher as Henricus Kunraht. It was written in New Latin rather than the vernacular Dutch in an attempt to avoid censorship by the secular Dutch authorities.\n\nIn the treatise, Spinoza put forth his most systematic critique of Judaism, and all organized religion in general. Spinoza argued that theology and philosophy must be kept separate, particularly in the reading of scripture. Whereas the goal of theology is obedience, philosophy aims at understanding rational truth. Scripture does not teach philosophy and thus cannot be made to conform with it, otherwise the meaning of scripture will be distorted. Conversely, if reason is made subservient to scripture, then, Spinoza argues, \"the prejudices of a common people of long ago... will gain a hold on his understanding and darken it.\"\n\nHe reinterpreted the belief that there were such things as prophecy, miracles, or supernatural occurrences.(See Spinoza's views on miracles) He argued that God acts solely by the laws of \"his own nature\". He rejected the view that God had a particular end game or purpose to advance in the course of events: to Spinoza, those who believed so were only creating a delusion for themselves out of fear.\n\nSpinoza was not only the real father of modern metaphysics and moral and political philosophy, but also of the so-called higher criticism of the Bible. He was particularly attuned to the idea of interpretation; he felt that all organized religion was simply the institutionalized defense of particular interpretations. He rejected in its entirety the view that Moses composed the first five books of the Bible, called the Pentateuch by Christians or Torah by Jews. He provided an analysis of the structure of the Bible which demonstrated that it was essentially a compiled text with many different authors and diverse origins; in his view, it was not \"revealed\" all at once.\n\nHis \"Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\" undertook to show that Scriptures properly understood gave no authority for the militant intolerance of the clergy who sought to stifle all dissent by the use of force. To achieve his object, Spinoza had to show what is meant by a proper understanding of the Bible. And this gave him occasion to apply criticism to the Bible. To appreciate his services in this connection it must be remembered that his age was remarkably lacking in historical sense, especially in matters relating to religion. Saintly contemporaries like John Bunyan and Manasseh ben Israel made the most fantastic use of Scripture texts; while militant clerics, relying on the ignorant bibliolatry of the masses, misapplied Bible texts to gain their ends. Spinoza, who permitted no supernatural rival to Nature and no rival authority to the civil government of the state, rejected also all claims that Biblical literature should be treated in a manner entirely different from that in which any other document is treated that claims to be historical. His contention that the Bible \"is in parts imperfect, corrupt, erroneous, and inconsistent with itself, and that we possess but fragments of it\" roused great storm at the time, and was mainly responsible for his evil repute for a century at least. Nevertheless, many have gradually adopted his views, agreeing with him that the real \"word of God\", or true religion, is not something written in books but \"inscribed on the heart and mind of man\". And many scholars and ministers of religion now praise Spinoza's services in the correct interpretation of Scripture as a document of first rate importance in the progressive development of human thought and conduct.\n\nThe treatise also rejected the Jewish notion of \"chosenness\"; to Spinoza, all peoples are on par with each other, as God has not elevated one over the other. Spinoza also offered a sociological explanation as to how the Jewish people had managed to survive for so long, despite facing relentless persecution. In his view, the Jews had been preserved due to a combination of Gentile hatred and Jewish separatism.\n\nHe also gave one final, crucial reason for the continued Jewish presence, which in his view, was by itself sufficient to maintain the survival of the nation forever: circumcision. It was the ultimate anthropological expression of bodily marking, a tangible symbol of separateness which was the ultimate identifier.\n\nSpinoza also posited a novel view of the Torah; he claimed that it was essentially a political constitution of the ancient state of Israel. In his view, because the state no longer existed, its constitution could no longer be valid. He argued that the Torah was thus suited to a particular time and place; because times and circumstances had changed, the Torah could no longer be regarded as a valid document.\n\nSpinoza agreed with Thomas Hobbes that if each man had to fend for himself, with nothing but his own right arm to rely upon, then the life of man would be \"nasty, brutish, and short\". The truly human life is only possible in an organised community, that is, a state or commonwealth. The state ensures security of life, limb and property; it brings within reach of every individual many necessaries of life which he could not produce by himself; and it sets free sufficient time and energy for the higher development of human powers. Now the existence of a state depends upon a kind of implicit agreement on the part of its members or citizens to obey the sovereign authority which governs it. In a state no one can be allowed to do just as he pleases. Every citizen is obliged to obey its laws; and he is not free even to interpret the laws in a special manner. This looks at first like a loss of freedom on the part of the individuals, and the establishment of an absolute power over them. Yet that is not really so. In the first place, without the advantages of an organised state the average individual would be so subject to dangers and hardships of all kinds and to his own passions that he could not be called free in any real sense of the term, least of all in the sense that Spinoza used it. Man needs the state not only to save him from others but also from his own lower impulses and to enable him to live a life of reason, which alone is truly human. In the second place, state sovereignty is never really absolute. It is true that almost any kind of government is better than none, so that it is worth while bearing much that is irksome rather than disturb the peace. But a reasonably wise government will even in its own interest endeavour to secure the good will and cooperation of its citizens by refraining from unreasonable measures, and will permit or even encourage its citizens to advocate reforms, provided they employ peaceable means. In this way the state really rests, in the last resort, on the united will of the citizens, on what Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who read Spinoza, subsequently called the \"general will\".\n\nSpinoza sometimes writes as if the state upheld absolute sovereignty. But that is due mainly to his determined opposition to every kind of ecclesiastical control over it. Though he is prepared to support what may be called a state religion, as a kind of spiritual cement, yet his account of this religion is such as to make it acceptable to the adherents of any one of the historic creeds, to deists, pantheists and all others, provided they are not fanatical believers or unbelievers. It is really in the interest of freedom of thought and speech that Spinoza would entrust the civil government with something approaching absolute sovereignty in order to effectively resist the tyranny of the militant churches.\n\nOne of the most striking features in Spinoza's political theory is his basic principle that \"right is might.\" This principle he applied systematically to the whole problem of government, and seemed rather pleased with his achievement, inasmuch as it enabled him to treat political theory in a scientific spirit, as if he were dealing with applied mathematics. The identification or correlation of right with power has caused much misunderstanding. People supposed that Spinoza reduced justice to brute force. But Spinoza was very far from approving \"Realpolitik\". In the philosophy of Spinoza the term \"power\" (as should be clear from his moral philosophy) means a great deal more than physical force. In a passage near the end of his \"Political Treatise\" he states explicitly that \"human power chiefly consists in strength of mind and intellect\" — it consists in fact, of all the human capacities and aptitudes, especially the highest of them. Conceived correctly, Spinoza's whole philosophy leaves ample scope for ideal motives in the life of the individual and of the community.\n\nSpinoza discusses the principal kinds of states, or the main types of government, namely, Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy. Each has its own peculiarities and needs special safeguards, if it is to realise the primary function of a state. Monarchy may degenerate into Tyranny unless it is subjected to various constitutional checks which will prevent any attempt at autocracy. Similarly, Aristocracy may degenerate into Oligarchy and needs analogous checks. On the whole, Spinoza favours Democracy, by which he meant any kind of representative government. In the case of Democracy the community and the government are more nearly identical than in the case of Monarchy or Aristocracy; consequently a democracy is least likely to experience frequent collisions between the people and the government and so is best adapted to secure and maintain that peace, which it is the business of the state to secure.\n\nIt is unlikely that Spinoza's \"Tractatus\" ever had political support of any kind, with attempts being made to suppress it even before Dutch magistrate Johan de Witt's murder in 1672. In 1673, it was publicly condemned by the Synod of Dordrecht (1673) and banned officially the following year. Harsh criticism of the TTP began to appear almost as soon as it was published. One of the first, and most notorious, critiques was by Leipzig professor Jakob Thomasius in 1670.\nThe British philosopher G. E. Moore suggested to Ludwig Wittgenstein that he title one of his works \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" as a homage to Spinoza's treatise.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32003", "title": "Umberto Eco", "text": "Umberto Eco\n\nUmberto Eco (; ; 5 January 1932 – 19 February 2016) was an Italian novelist, literary critic, philosopher, semiotician, and university professor. He is best known internationally for his 1980 novel \"Il nome della rosa\" (\"The Name of the Rose\"), a historical mystery combining semiotics in fiction with biblical analysis, medieval studies, and literary theory. He later wrote other novels, including \"Il pendolo di Foucault\" (\"Foucault's Pendulum\") and \"L'isola del giorno prima\" (\"The Island of the Day Before\"). His novel \"Il cimitero di Praga\" (\"The Prague Cemetery\"), released in 2010, topped the bestseller charts in Italy.\n\nEco also wrote academic texts, children's books, and essays. He was the founder of the Department of Media Studies at the University of the Republic of San Marino, president of the Graduate School for the Study of the Humanities at the University of Bologna, member of the Accademia dei Lincei, and an honorary fellow of Kellogg College, Oxford.\n\nEco was honored with the \"Kenyon Review\" Award for Literary Achievement in 2005 along with Roger Angell.\n\nEco was born in the city of Alessandria, in Piedmont in northern Italy, and here he attended high school. His father, Giulio, one of thirteen children, was an accountant before the government called him to serve in three wars. During World War II, Umberto and his mother, Giovanna (Bisio), moved to a small village in the Piedmontese mountainside. Eco received a Salesian education and made references to the order and its founder in his works and interviews. His family name is supposedly an acronym of \"ex caelis oblatus\" (from Latin: a gift from the heavens), which was given to his grandfather (a foundling) by a city official.\n\nUmberto's father urged him to become a lawyer, but he entered the University of Turin to take up medieval philosophy and literature, writing his thesis on Thomas Aquinas and earning a Laurea degree in philosophy in 1954. During his university studies, Eco stopped believing in God and left the Catholic Church. After that, Eco worked as a cultural editor for the state broadcasting station Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI) and lectured at the University of Turin (1956–1964). A group of avant-garde artists, painters, musicians and writers, whom he had befriended at RAI (Gruppo 63), became an important and influential component in Eco's writing career. This was especially true after the publication of his first book in 1956, \"Il problema estetico in San Tommaso\", which was an extension of his Laurea thesis. This also marked the beginning of his lecturing career at his alma mater.\n\nIn September 1962 he married Renate Ramge, a German art teacher with whom he had a son and a daughter.\n\nHe divided his time between an apartment in Milan and a vacation house near Urbino. He had a 30,000 volume library in the former and a 20,000 volume library in the latter. He was a visiting professor at Columbia University several times in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992–1993 Eco was the Norton professor at Harvard University. On 8 May 1993, Eco received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (D.H.L.) from Indiana University Bloomington in recognition of his over fifteen-year association with the university's Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies. Six books that were authored, co-authored, or co-edited by Eco were published by Indiana University Press. In 1996, he was appointed Honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Tartu. He frequently collaborated with his friend Thomas Sebeok, semiotician and Distinguished Professor of Linguistics at Indiana University. He became Satrap of the Collège de 'Pataphysique in 2001. On 23 May 2002, Eco received an honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 2009, the University of Belgrade in Serbia awarded him an honorary doctorate. Eco was a member of the Italian skeptic organization \"Comitato Italiano per il Controllo delle Affermazioni sulle Pseudoscienze\" (Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences) CICAP.\n\nEco died at his Milanese home of pancreatic cancer, from which he had been suffering for two years, on the night of 19 February 2016. At the time of his death at the age of 84, he was a professor emeritus at the University of Bologna, a position that he had held since 2008.\n\nIn 1959 Eco published his second book, \"Sviluppo dell'estetica medievale\" (\"The Development of Medieval Aesthetics\"), on medieval philosophy. After 18 months' military service in the Italian Army, he left RAI in 1959 to become the senior non-fiction editor of the Bompiani publishing house in Milan, a position he occupied until 1975.\n\nEco began seriously developing his ideas on the \"open\" text and on semiotics, writing many essays on these subjects, and in 1962 he published \"Opera aperta\" (translated into English as \"The Open Work\"). In it, Eco argued that literary texts are fields of meaning, rather than strings of meaning; and that they are understood as open, internally dynamic and psychologically engaged fields. Literature which limits one's potential understanding to a single, unequivocal line, the \"closed text\", remains the least rewarding, while texts that are the most active between mind, society and life (open texts) are the liveliest and best—although valuation terminology was not his primary focus. Eco came to these positions through study of language and from semiotics, rather than from psychology or historical analysis (as did theorists such as Wolfgang Iser, on the one hand, and Hans Robert Jauss, on the other).\n\nEco's short 1961 essay \"Fenomenologia di Mike Bongiorno\" (\"Phenomenology of Mike Bongiorno\", on the most popular quiz show host in Italy) received much notoriety among the general public and has drawn endless questions by journalists at every public appearance by Eco; the essay was later included in the collection \"Diario minimo\" (1963). His book \"Apocalittici e integrati\" (1964) analyzes the phenomenon of mass communication from a sociological perspective.\n\nIn 1967 he gave the influential lecture \"Towards a Semiological Guerrilla Warfare\", which coined the influential term \"semiological guerrilla\", and influenced the theorization of guerrilla tactics against mainstream mass media culture, such as guerrilla television and culture jamming. Among the expressions used in the essay are \"communications guerrilla warfare\" and \"cultural guerrilla\". The essay was later included in Eco's book \"Faith in Fakes\".\n\nIn 2012, Eco and Jean-Claude Carrière published a book of conversations on the future of information carriers. Eco criticized social networks, saying for example that \"Social media gives legions of idiots the right to speak when they once only spoke at a bar after a glass of wine, without harming the community [...] but now they have the same right to speak as a Nobel Prize winner. It's the invasion of the idiots.\"\n\nEco founded and developed one of the most important approaches in contemporary semiotics, usually referred to as interpretative semiotics. The main books in which he elaborates his theory are \"La struttura assente\" (1968; literally: \"The Absent Structure\"), \"A Theory of Semiotics\" (1975), \"The Role of the Reader\" (1979), \"Semiotics and Philosophy of Language\" (1984), \"The Limits of Interpretation\" (1990), \"Kant and the Platypus\" (1997), and \"From the Tree to the Labyrinth: Historical Studies on the Sign and Interpretation\" (2014).\n\nEco co-founded \"Versus: Quaderni di studi semiotici\" (known as \"VS \"among Italian academics), a semiotic journal. \"VS\" is used by scholars whose work is related to signs and signification. The journal's foundation and activities have contributed to semiotics as an academic field in its own right, both in Italy and in the rest of Europe. Most of the well-known European semioticians, including Eco, A. J. Greimas, Jean-Marie Floch, and Jacques Fontanille, as well as philosophers and linguists like John Searle and George Lakoff, have published original articles in \"VS\". His work with Serbian and Russian scholars and writers included thought on Milorad Pavić and a meeting with Alexander Genis.\n\nIn 1988, at the University of Bologna, Eco created an unusual program called \"Anthropology of the West\" from the perspective of non-Westerners (African and Chinese scholars), as defined by their own criteria. Eco developed this transcultural international network based on the idea of Alain le Pichon in West Africa. The Bologna program resulted in the first conference in Guangzhou, China, in 1991 entitled \"Frontiers of Knowledge\". The first event was soon followed by an Itinerant Euro-Chinese seminar on \"Misunderstandings in the Quest for the Universal\" along the silk trade route from Guangzhou to Beijing. The latter culminated in a book entitled \"The Unicorn and the Dragon\", which discussed the question of the creation of knowledge in China and in Europe. Scholars contributing to this volume were from China, including Tang Yijie, Wang Bin and Yue Daiyun, as well as from Europe: Furio Colombo, Antoine Danchin, Jacques Le Goff, Paolo Fabbri and Alain Rey.\n\nIn 2000 a seminar in Timbuktu, Mali, was followed up with another gathering in Bologna to reflect on the conditions of reciprocal knowledge between East and West. This, in turn, gave rise to a series of conferences in Brussels, Paris and Goa, culminating in Beijing in 2007. The topics of the Beijing conference were \"Order and Disorder\", \"New Concepts of War and Peace\", \"Human Rights\" and \"Social Justice and Harmony\". Eco presented the opening lecture. Among those giving presentations were anthropologists Balveer Arora, Varun Sahni, and Rukmini Bhaya Nair from India, Moussa Sow from Africa, Roland Marti and Maurice Olender from Europe, Cha Insuk from Korea, and Huang Ping and Zhao Tinyang from China. Also on the program were scholars from the fields of law and science including Antoine Danchin, Ahmed Djebbar and Dieter Grimm. Eco's interest in East-West dialogue to facilitate international communication and understanding also correlates with his related interest in the international auxiliary language Esperanto.\n\nEco's fiction has enjoyed a wide audience around the world, with many translations. His novels are full of subtle, often multilingual, references to literature and history. Eco's work illustrates the concept of intertextuality, or the inter-connectedness of all literary works. Eco cited James Joyce and Jorge Luis Borges as the two modern authors who have influenced his work the most.\n\nEco employed his education as a medievalist in his first novel \"The Name of the Rose\" (1980), a historical mystery set in a 14th-century monastery. Franciscan friar William of Baskerville, aided by his assistant Adso, a Benedictine novice, investigates a series of murders at a monastery that is to host an important religious debate. The novel contains many direct or indirect metatextual references to other sources, requiring the detective work of the reader to 'solve'. The title is unexplained in the book. As a symbol, the rose is ubiquitous enough not to confer any single meaning. There is a tribute to Jorge Luis Borges, a major influence on Eco, in the blind monk and librarian Jorge of Burgos: Borges, like the character Jorge, lived a celibate life consecrated to his passion for books, and also went blind in later life. William of Baskerville is a logically-minded Englishman who is a friar and a detective, and his name evokes both William of Ockham and Sherlock Holmes (by way of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\"); several passages describing him are strongly reminiscent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's descriptions of Holmes. The underlying mystery of the murder is borrowed from the \"Arabian Nights\". \"The Name of the Rose\" was later made into a motion picture starring Sean Connery, F. Murray Abraham, Christian Slater and Ron Perlman, which follows the plot, though not the philosophical and historical themes, of the novel.\n\nIn \"Foucault's Pendulum\" (1988), three under-employed editors who work for a minor publishing house decide to amuse themselves by inventing a conspiracy theory. Their conspiracy, which they call \"The Plan\", is about an immense and intricate plot to take over the world by a secret order descended from the Knights Templar. As the game goes on, the three slowly become obsessed with the details of this plan. The game turns dangerous when outsiders learn of The Plan, and believe that the men have really discovered the secret to regaining the lost treasure of the Templars.\n\n\"The Island of the Day Before\" (1994) was Eco's third novel. The book, set in the seventeenth century, is about a man stranded on a ship within sight of an island which he believes is on the other side of the international date-line. The main character is trapped by his inability to swim and instead spends the bulk of the book reminiscing on his life and the adventures that brought him to be stranded.\n\n\"Baudolino\" was published in 2000. Baudolino is a knight who saves the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates during the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade. Claiming to be an accomplished liar, he confides his history, from his childhood as a peasant lad endowed with a vivid imagination, through his role as adopted son of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, to his mission to visit the mythical realm of Prester John. Throughout his retelling, Baudolino brags of his ability to swindle and tell tall tales, leaving the historian (and the reader) unsure of just how much of his story was a lie.\n\n\"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana\" (2005) is about Giambattista Bodoni, an old bookseller specializing in antiques who emerges from a coma with only some memories to recover his past. Bodoni is pressed to make a very difficult choice, one between his past and his future. He must either abandon his past to live his future or regain his past and sacrifice his future.\n\n\"The Prague Cemetery\", Eco's sixth novel, was published in 2010. It is the story of a secret agent who \"weaves plots, conspiracies, intrigues and attacks, and helps determine the historical and political fate of the European Continent\". The book is a narrative of the rise of Modern-day antisemitism, by way of the Dreyfus affair, \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" and other important 19th century events which gave rise to hatred and hostility toward the Jewish people.\n\n\"Numero Zero\" was published in 2015. Set in 1992 and narrated by Colonna, a hack journalist working on a Milan newspaper, it offers a satire of Italy's kickback and bribery culture as well as, among many things, the legacy of Fascism.\n\n\n\nTen essays on methods of abductive inference in Poe's Dupin, Doyle's Holmes, Peirce and many others, 236 pages.\n\n\n"}

He was also the founder of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and served as its chairman until his execution in 1979.\n\nEducated at Berkeley and Oxford, Bhutto trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. He entered politics as one of President Iskander Mirza's cabinet members, before being assigned several ministries during President Ayub Khan's military rule from 1958. Appointed Foreign Minister in 1963, Bhutto was a proponent of Operation Gibraltar in Kashmir, leading to war with India in 1965. After the Tashkent Agreement ended hostilities, Bhutto fell out with Ayub and was sacked from government. He founded the PPP in 1967, contesting general elections held by President Yahya Khan in 1970. While the Awami League won a majority of seats overall, the PPP won a majority of seats in West Pakistan; the two parties were unable to agree on a new constitution in particular on the issue of Six Point Movement which many in West Pakistan saw as a way to break up the country. Subsequent uprisings led to the secession of Bangladesh, and Pakistan losing the war against Bangladesh-allied India in 1971. Bhutto was handed over the presidency in December 1971 and emergency rule was imposed. When Bhutto set about rebuilding Pakistan, he stated his intention was to \"rebuild confidence and rebuild hope for the future\".\n\nBy July 1972, Bhutto had recovered 43,600 prisoners of war and 5,000 square miles of Indian-held territory after signing the Simla Agreement. He strengthened ties with China and Saudi Arabia, recognised Bangladesh, and hosted the second Organisation of the Islamic Conference in Lahore in 1974. Domestically, Bhutto's reign saw parliament unanimously approve a new constitution in 1973, upon which he appointed Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry President and switched to the newly empowered office of Prime Minister. He also played an integral role in initiating the country's nuclear programme. However, Bhutto's nationalisation of much of Pakistan's fledgling industries, healthcare, and educational institutions led to economic stagnation. After dissolving provincial feudal governments in Balochistan was met with unrest, Bhutto also ordered an army operation in the province in 1973, causing thousands of civilian casualties.\n\nDespite civil disorder, the PPP won parliamentary elections in 1977 by a wide margin. However, the opposition alleged widespread vote rigging, and violence escalated across the country. On 5 July that same year, Bhutto was deposed by his appointed army chief General Zia-ul-Haq in a military coup before being controversially tried and executed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 1979 for authorising the murder of a political opponent. While Bhutto remains a contentious figure in Pakistan's history, his party, the PPP, remains among Pakistan's largest, his daughter Benazir Bhutto was twice elected Prime Minister, and his son-in-law and Benazir's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, served as President.\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto belonged to a Sindhi family,he was born to Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto and Khursheed Begum (née Lakhi Bai) near Larkana. Zulfikar was their third child—their first one, Sikandar Ali, had died from pneumonia at age seven in 1914, and the second, Imdad Ali, died of cirrhosis at age 39 in 1953. His father was the \"dewan\" of the princely state of Junagadh, and enjoyed an influential relationship with the officials of the British Raj. As a young boy, Bhutto moved to Worli Seaface in Bombay to study at the Cathedral and John Connon School. He then also became an activist in the Pakistan Movement. In 1943, his marriage was arranged with Shireen Amir Begum. He later divorced her in 1945, however, in order to remarry. In 1947, Bhutto was admitted to the University of Southern California to study political science.\n\nIn 1949, as a sophomore, Bhutto transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a B.A. (honours) degree in political science in 1950. There, Bhutto became interested in the theories of socialism, delivering a series of lectures on their feasibility in Islamic countries. During this time, Bhutto's father played a controversial role in the affairs of Junagadh. Coming to power in a palace coup, he secured the accession of his state to Pakistan, which was ultimately negated by Indian intervention in December 1947. In June 1950, Bhutto travelled to the United Kingdom to study law at Christ Church, Oxford and received an LLB, followed by an LLM degree in law and an M.Sc. (honours) degree in political science. Upon finishing his studies, he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1953. He was fellow of Barrister Ijaz Hussain Batalvi who later appeared in his case as prosecutor.\n\nBhutto married his second wife, Nusrat Ispahani, an Iranian-Kurdish woman, in Karachi on 8 September 1951. Their first child, Benazir, was born in 1953. She was followed by Murtaza in 1954, Sanam in 1957 and Shahnawaz in 1958. He accepted the post of lecturer at the S. M. Law College, from where he was also awarded an honorary doctorate in law by college president Hassanally A. Rahman before establishing himself in a legal practice in Karachi. He also took over the management of his family's estate and business interests after his father's death.\n\nIn 1957, Bhutto became the youngest member of Pakistan's delegation to the United Nations. He addressed the UN Sixth Committee on Aggression that October and led Pakistan's delegation to the first UN Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1958. That year, Bhutto became Pakistan's youngest cabinet minister, taking up the reins of the Ministry of Commerce by President Iskander Mirza, pre-\"coup d'état\" government. In 1960, he was promoted to Minister of Water and Power, Communications and Industry. Bhutto became trusted ally and advisor of Ayub Khan, rising in influence and power despite his youth and relative inexperience. Bhutto aided his president in negotiating the Indus Water Treaty in India in 1960 and next year negotiated an oil-exploration agreement with the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide economic and technical aid to Pakistan.\n\nBhutto was a Pakistani nationalist and socialist, with particular views on the type of democracy needed in Pakistan. On becoming foreign minister in 1963, his socialist viewpoint influenced him to embark on a close relationship with neighbouring China. At the time, many other countries accepted Taiwan as the legitimate single government of China, at a time when two governments each claimed to be \"China\". In 1964, the Soviet Union and its satellite states broke off relations with Beijing over ideological differences, and only Albania and Pakistan supported the People's Republic of China. Bhutto staunchly supported Beijing in the UN, and in the UNSC, while also continuing to build bridges to the United States. Bhutto's strong advocacy of developing ties with China came under criticism from the United States. President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote to Bhutto, warning him that further overtures to China would jeopardize congressional support for aid to Pakistan. Bhutto addressed his speeches in a demagogic style and headed the foreign ministry aggressively. His leadership style and his swift rise to power brought him national prominence and popularity. Bhutto and his staff visited Beijing and were warmly received by the Chinese, and Bhutto greeted Mao Zedong with great respect. There, Bhutto helped Ayub negotiate trade and military agreements with the Chinese regime, which agreed to help Pakistan in several military and industrial projects.\n\nBhutto signed the Sino-Pakistan Boundary Agreement on 2 March 1963 that transferred 750 square kilometres of territory from Pakistan-administered Kashmir to Chinese control. Bhutto asserted his belief in non-alignment, making Pakistan an influential member in non-aligned organisations. Believing in pan-Islamic unity, Bhutto developed closer relations with the likes of Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Bhutto significantly transformed Pakistan's hitherto pro-West foreign policy. While maintaining a prominent role for Pakistan within the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization, Bhutto began asserting a foreign policy course for Pakistan that was independent of U.S. influence. Meanwhile, Bhutto visited both East and West Germany and established a strong link between two countries. Bhutto proceeded economical, technological, industrial and military agreements with Germany. Bhutto strengthened Pakistan's strategic alliance with Germany. Bhutto addressed a farewell speech at the University of Munich, where he cited the importance of Pakistan and German relations. Bhutto then visited Poland and established diplomatic relations in 1962. Bhutto used Pakistan Air Force's Brigadier-General Władysław Turowicz to establish the military and economical link between Pakistan and Poland. Bhutto sought and reached to the Polish community in Pakistan and made a tremendous effort for a fresh avenues for mutual cooperation.\n\nIn 1962, as territorial differences increased between India and China, Beijing was planning to stage an invasion in northern territories of India. Premier Zhou Enlai and Mao invited Pakistan to join the raid to illegally rest the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir from India. Bhutto advocated for the plan, but Ayub opposed the plan: he was afraid of retaliation by Indian troops. Instead Ayub proposed a \"joint defence union\" with India. Bhutto was shocked by such statements and felt Ayub Khan was unlettered in international affairs. Bhutto was conscious that despite Pakistan's membership of anti-communist western alliances, China had refrained from criticising Pakistan. In 1962, the U.S. assured Pakistan that “Kashmir issues” will be resolved according to the wishes of Pakistanis and the “Kashmiris”. Therefore, Ayub did not participate in the Chinese plans. Bhutto criticised the U.S. for providing military aid to India during and after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, which was seen as an abrogation of Pakistan's alliance with the United States\n\nMeanwhile, Ayub Khan, on Bhutto's counsel, launched Operation Gibraltar in a bid to \"liberate\" Kashmir. It ended in a fiasco and the Indian Armed Forces launched a successful counter-attack on West Pakistan (Indo-Pakistani War of 1965). This war was an aftermath of brief skirmishes that took place between March and August 1965 on the international boundaries in the Rann of Kutch, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Bhutto joined Ayub in Uzbekistan to negotiate a peace treaty with the Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Ayub and Shastri agreed to exchange prisoners of war and withdraw respective forces to pre-war boundaries. This agreement was deeply unpopular in Pakistan, causing major political unrest against Ayub's regime. Bhutto's criticism of the final agreement caused a major rift between him and Ayub. Initially denying the rumours, Bhutto resigned in June 1966 and expressed strong opposition to Ayub's regime.\n\nDuring his term, Bhutto was known to be formulating aggressive geostrategic and foreign policies against India. In 1965, Bhutto's friend Munir Ahmad Khan informed him of the status of India's nuclear programme. Bhutto reportedly said, \"Pakistan will fight, fight for a thousand years. If.. India builds the (atom) bomb... (Pakistan) will eat grass or (leaves), even go hungry, but we (Pakistan) will get one of our own (atom bomb)... We (Pakistan) have no other Choice!\". In his 1969 book \"The Myth of Independence\" Bhutto argued that it was the “necessity” for Pakistan to acquire the fission weapon, and start a so-called deterrence programme to be able to stand up to the industrialised states, and against a nuclear armed India. Bhutto obtained a manifesto and made a future policy on how the programme would be developed and which individual scientists would start the program. Bhutto selected Munir Ahmad Khan and Abdus Salam (a Nobel laureate and Ahmadi Muslim and despite Bhutto’s constitutional designation in Pakistan of Ahmadis as “non-Muslim”) that Ahmaan Ahmadiyuaas the first and main basis of the programme.\n\nFollowing his resignation as foreign minister, large crowds gathered to listen to Bhutto's speech upon his arrival in Lahore on 21 June 1967. Tapping a wave of anger against Ayub, Bhutto travelled across Pakistan to deliver political speeches. In October 1966 Bhutto made explicit the beliefs of his new party, \"Islam is our faith, democracy is our policy, socialism is our economy. All power to the people.\" On 30 November 1967, at the Lahore residence of Mubashir Hassan, a gathering that included Bhutto, Bengali communist J. A. Rahim and Basit Jehangir Sheikh founded the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), establishing a strong base in Punjab, Sindh and amongst the Muhajirs.\n\nHassan, an engineering professor at UET Lahore, was the main brain and hidden hand behind the success and the rise of Bhutto. Under Hassan's guidance and Bhutto's leadership, the PPP became a part of the pro-democracy movement involving diverse political parties from all across Pakistan. The PPP activists staged large protests and strikes in different parts of the country, increasing pressure on Ayub to resign. Dr. Hassan and Bhutto's arrest on 12 November 1969, sparked greater political unrest. After his release, Bhutto, joined by key leaders of PPP, attended the Round Table Conference called by Ayub Khan in Rawalpindi, but refused to accept Ayub's continuation in office and the East-Pakistani politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Six point movement for regional autonomy.\n\nFollowing Ayub's resignation, his successor, General Yahya Khan promised to hold parliamentary elections on 7 December 1970. Bhutto attracted the leftist and ultra-leftist forces, who gathered under his leadership, becoming the full sum of force. The Socialist-Communist mass, under Bhutto's leadership, intensified its support in Muhajir and poor farming communities in West Pakistan, working through educating people to cast their vote for their better future. Gathering and uniting the scattered socialist-marxist mass in one single center was considered Bhutto's greatest political achievements and as its result, the leftist and Bhutto's party won a large number of seats from constituencies in West-Pakistan. However, Sheikh Mujib's Awami League won an absolute majority in the legislature, receiving more than twice as many votes as Bhutto's PPP. Bhutto refused to accept an Awami League government and famously promised to \"break the legs\" of any elected PPP member who dared to attend the inaugural session of the National Assembly. Capitalising on West Pakistani fears of East Pakistani separatism, Bhutto demanded that Sheikh Mujib form a coalition with the PPP. Amidst popular outrage in East Pakistan, Sheikh Mujib declared the independence of \"Bangladesh\". According to historical references and a report published by leading newspaper, \"Mujib no longer believed in Pakistan and was determined to make Bangladesh\". As long as she is the prime minister, relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan cannot normalise, \"The Nation\" noted.\nOn 26 March 1971 Mujib was arrested by the Pakistan Army, which had been ordered by Yahya to suppress political activities. While supportive of the army's actions and working to rally international support, Bhutto distanced himself from the Yahya regime and began to criticise Khan for mishandling the situation. He refused to accept Yahya's scheme to appoint Bengali politician Nurul Amin as Prime minister, with Bhutto as deputy prime minister. Soon after his refusal and continuous resentment toward General Yahya Khan's mishandling of situation, General Yahya Khan ordered Military Police to arrest Bhutto for a treason charges, a quiet similar to Mujib. Bhutto was situated at the Adiala Jail along with Mujib, where he was set to face the charges. The Indian intervention in East Pakistan led to the very bitter defeat of Pakistani forces, who surrendered on 16 December 1971. Bhutto and others condemned Yahya for failing to protect Pakistan's unity. Isolated, Yahya resigned on 20 December and transferred power to Bhutto, who became president, commander-in-chief and the first civilian chief martial law administrator.\n\nBhutto was the country's first civilian chief martial law administrator since 1958, as well as the country's first civilian president. With Bhutto assuming the control, the leftists and democratic socialists entered the country's politics, and later emerged as power players in the country's politics. And, for the first time in the country's history, the leftists and democratic socialists had a chance to administer the country with the popular vote and widely approved exclusive mandate, given to them by the West's population in the 1970s elections.\n\nIn a reference written by Kuldip Nayar in his book \"Scoop! Inside Stories from the Partition to the Present\", Nayar noted that \"Bhutto's releasing of Mujib did not mean anything to Pakistan's policy as in if there was no liberation war. Bhutto's policy, and even as of today, the policy of Pakistan continues to state that \"she will continue to fight for the honor and integrity of Pakistan. East Pakistan is an inseparable and unseverable part of Pakistan\".\n\nA Pakistan International Airlines flight was sent to fetch Bhutto from New York, who at that time was presenting Pakistan's case before the United Nations Security Council on the East Pakistan Crises. Bhutto returned home on 18 December 1971. On 20 December, he was taken to the President House in Rawalpindi, where he took over two positions from Yahya Khan, one as president and the other as first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator. Thus, he was the first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator of the dismembered Pakistan. By the time Bhutto had assumed control of what remained of Pakistan, the nation was completely isolated, angered, and demoralized.\n\nAs president, Bhutto faced mounting challenges on both internal and foreign fronts. The trauma was severe in Pakistan, a psychological setback and emotional breakdown for Pakistan. The two-nation theory—the theoretical basis for the creation of Pakistan—lay discredited, and Pakistan's foreign policy collapsed when no moral support was found anywhere, including long-standing allies such as the U.S. and China. Since her creation, the physical and moral existence of Pakistan was in great danger. On the internal front, Baloch, Sindhi and Pashtun nationalisms were at their peak, calling for their independence from Pakistan. Finding it difficult to keep Pakistan united, Bhutto launched full-fledged intelligence and military operations to stamp out any separatist movements. By the end of 1978, these nationalist organizations were brutally quelled by Pakistan Armed Forces.\n\nBhutto immediately placed Yahya Khan under house arrest, brokered a ceasefire and ordered the release of Sheikh Mujib, who was held prisoner by the Pakistan Army. To implement this, Bhutto reversed the verdict of Mujib's earlier court-martial trial, in which Brigadier-General Rahimuddin Khan had sentenced Mujib to death. Appointing a new cabinet, Bhutto appointed Lieutenant-General Gul Hasan as Chief of Army Staff. On 2 January 1972 Bhutto announced the nationalisation of all major industries, including iron and steel, heavy engineering, heavy electricals, petrochemicals, cement and public utilities. A new labour policy was announced increasing workers' rights and the power of trade unions. Although he came from a feudal background himself, Bhutto announced reforms limiting land ownership and a government take-over of over a million acres to distribute to landless peasants. More than 2,000 civil servants were dismissed on charges of corruption. Bhutto also dismissed the military chiefs on 3 March after they refused orders to suppress a major police strike in Punjab. He appointed General Tikka Khan as the new Chief of the Army Staff in March 1972 as he felt the general would not interfere in political matters and would concentrate on rehabilitating the Pakistan Army. Bhutto convened the National Assembly on 14 April, rescinded martial law on 21 April and charged the legislators with writing a new constitution.\n\nBhutto visited India to meet Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and negotiated a formal peace agreement and the release of 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war. The two leaders signed the Simla Agreement, which committed both nations to establish a new-yet-temporary Line of Control in Kashmir and obligated them to resolve disputes peacefully through bilateral talks. Bhutto also promised to hold a future summit for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute and pledged to recognise Bangladesh. Although he secured the release of Pakistani soldiers held by India, Bhutto was criticised by many in Pakistan for allegedly making too many concessions to India. It is theorised that Bhutto feared his downfall if he could not secure the release of Pakistani soldiers and the return of territory occupied by Indian forces. Bhutto established an atomic power development programme and inaugurated the first Pakistani atomic reactor, built in collaboration with Canada in Karachi on 28 November. On 30 March 59 military officers were arrested by army troops for allegedly plotting a coup against Bhutto, who appointed then-Brigadier Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to head a military tribunal to investigate and try the suspects. The National Assembly approved the new 1973 Constitution, which Bhutto signed into effect on 12 April. The constitution proclaimed an \"Islamic Republic\" in Pakistan with a parliamentary form of government. On 10 August, Bhutto turned over the post of president to Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry, assuming the office of prime minister instead.\n\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto was the founder of Pakistan's atomic bomb programme, and due to his administrative and aggressive leadership to lead this nuclear deterrence programme, Bhutto is often known as Father of Nuclear deterrence programme. Bhutto's interest in nuclear technology was said to have begun during his college years in the United States when Bhutto attended a course in political science, discussing political impact of U.S.'s first nuclear test, \"Trinity\", on Global politics. While at Berkeley, Bhutto witnessed the public panic when the Soviet Union first exploded the bomb, codename \"First Lightning\" in 1949, prompting the U.S. government to famously launch the research on Hydrogen bombs. However, in 1958 when long before as Minister for Fuel, Power, and National Resources, Bhutto played a key role in setting up the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) administrative research bodies and institutes. Soon, Bhutto offered a technical post to Munir Ahmad Khan in PAEC in 1958, and lobbied for Abdus Salam as being appointed as Science Adviser in 1960. Before being elevated as Foreign minister, Bhutto directed the funds for key research in nuclear weapons and related science.\n\nIn October 1965, as Foreign Minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto visited Vienna, where nuclear engineer Munir Ahmad Khan working at a senior technical post at the IAEA, informed him of the status of Indian nuclear programme and the options Pakistan had to develop its own nuclear capability. Both agreed on the need for Pakistan to develop a nuclear deterrent to meet India's nuclear capacity. While, Munir Ahmad Khan had failed to convince Ayub Khan, Bhutto had said to Munir Ahmad Khan: \"Don't worry, our turn will come\". Shortly, after the 1965 war, Bhutto in a press conference, famously declared that \"even if we have to eat grass, we will make nuclear bomb. We have no other choice.\" as he saw India was making its way to develop the bomb. In 1965, Bhutto lobbied for Salam and succeeded to appoint Salam as the head of Pakistan's delegation at IAEA, and helped Salam to lobby for acquiring of the nuclear power plants. In November 1972, Bhutto advised Salam to travel to United States to evade the war, and advised him to return with the key literature on nuclear history. By the end week of December 1972, Salam returned to Pakistan, loaded with literature on the \"Manhattan Project\", in his huge suitcases. In 1974, Bhutto launched a more aggressive and serious diplomatic offensive on the United States and the Western world over the nuclear issues. Writing to the world and Western leaders, Bhutto made it clear and maintained:\n\nShortly, roughly two weeks past after experiencing the 1971 winter war, on 20 January 1972, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto rallied a conference of nuclear scientists and engineers at Multan. While at the Multan meeting, arranged by Bhutto's Science Advisor Abdus Salam, scientists were wondering why the President who had so much on his hands in those trying days was paying so much attention to the scientists and engineers in the nuclear field. At the meeting Bhutto slowly talked about the recent war and country's future, pointing out the existence of the country was in great moral danger. While the academicians listened to Bhutto carefully, Bhutto said: \"Look, we're going to have the bomb\". Bhutto asked them: \"Can you give it to me? And how long will it take it to make a bomb?\". Many of senior scientists had witnessed the war, and were emotionally and psychologically disturbed, therefore, the response was positive when the senior academic scientists replied: \"Oh...Yes.. Yes... You can have it.\" There was a lively debate on the time needed to make the bomb, and finally one scientist dared to say that maybe it could be done in five years. Prime Minister Bhutto smiled, lifted his hand, and dramatically thrust forward three fingers and said: \"Three years, I want it in three years\". The atmosphere suddenly became electric. It was then that one of the junior scientist Siddique Ahmad Butt (a theoretical physicist), who under Munir Ahmad Khan's guiding hand would come to play a major role in making the fission weapon possible – jumped to his feet and clamoured for his leader's attention. Siddique Ahmad Butt replied: \"It can be done in three years\". When Bhutto heard Butt's reply, Bhutto was very much amused and said: \"Well... Much as I appreciate your enthusiasm, this is a very serious political decision, which Pakistan must make, and perhaps all Third World countries must make one day, because it is coming. So can you boys do it?\". Nearly all senior scientists replied in one tone: Yes... We can do it, given the resources and given the facilities\". Bhutto ended the meeting by simply saying: \"I shall find you the resources and I shall find you the facilities\".\n\nBefore the 1970s, the nuclear deterrence was long established under the government of Suhrawardy, but was completely peaceful and devoted for civil power. Bhutto, in his book \"The Myth of Independence\" in 1969 wrote that:\n\nAfter India's nuclear test – codename \"Smiling Buddha\"—in May 1974, Bhutto sensed and saw this test as final anticipation for Pakistan's death. In a press conference, held shortly after India's nuclear test, Bhutto said, \"India's nuclear program is designed to intimidate Pakistan and establish \"\"hegemony in the subcontinent\". Despite Pakistan limited financial resources, Bhutto was so enthusiastic about Pakistan nuclear energy project, that he is reported to have said \"Pakistanis will eat grass but make a nuclear bomb.\"\"\n\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission's militarisation was initiated on 20 January 1972 and, in its initial years, was implemented by Pakistan Army's Chief of Army Staff General Tikka Khan. The Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP-I) was inaugurated by Bhutto during his role as President of Pakistan at the end of 1972 The nuclear weapons programme was set up loosely based on Manhattan Project of the 1940s under the administrative control of Bhutto. And, senior academic scientists had a direct access to Bhutto, who kept him informed about every inch of the development. Bhutto's Science Advisor, Abdus Salam's office was also sat up in Bhutto's Prime minister Secretariat. On Bhutto's request, Salam had established and led the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) that marked the beginning of the nuclear deterrent programme. The TPG designed and developed the nuclear weapons as well as the entire programme. Later, Munir Ahmad Khan had him personally approved the budget for the development of the programme.\n\nWanting a capable administrator, Bhutto sought Lieutenant-General Rahimuddin Khan to chair the commission, which Rahimuddin declined, in 1971. Instead, in January 1972, Bhutto chose a U.S.-trained nuclear engineer, Munir Ahmad Khan, as chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) as Bhutto realised that he wanted an administrator who understood the scientific and economical needs of this such technologically giant and ambitious programme. Since 1965, Khan had developed an extremely close and trusted relationship with Bhutto, and even after his death, Benazir and Murtaza Bhutto were instructed by their father to keep in touch with Munir Ahmad Khan. In spring of 1976, Kahuta Research Facility, then known as Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL), as part of codename \"Project-706\", was also established by Bhutto, and brought under nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan and the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers' Lieutenant-General Zahid Ali Akbar.\n\nBecause Pakistan, under Bhutto, was not a signatory or party of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA), and British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) had immediately cancelled fuel reprocessing plant projects with PAEC. And, according to Causar Nyäzie, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission officials had misled Bhutto and he sought on a long journey to try to get nuclear fuel reprocessing plant from France. It was on the advice of A. Q. Khan that no fuel existed to reprocess and urged Bhutto to follow his pursuit of uranium enrichment. Bhutto tried to show he was still interested in that expensive route and was relieved when Kissinger persuaded the French to cancel the deal. Bhutto had trusted Munir Ahmad Khan's plans to develop the programme ingeniously, and the mainstream goal of showing such interest in French reprocessing plant was to give time to PAEC scientists to gain expertise in building its own reprocessing plants. By the time France's CEA cancelled the project, the PAEC had acquired 95% of the detailed plans of the plant and materials.\n\nMunir Ahmad Khan and Ishfaq Ahmad believed that since PAEC had acquired most of the detailed plans, work, plans, and materials, the PAEC, based on that 95% work, could build the plutonium reprocessing reactors on its own, Pakistan should stick to its original plan, the plutonium route. Bhutto did not disagree but saw an advantage in establishing another parallel programme, the uranium enrichment programme under Abdul Qadeer Khan. Both Munir Khan and Ahmed had shown their concern over on Abdul Qadeer Khan's suspected activities but Bhutto backed Khan when Bhutto maintained that: \"No less than any other nation did what Abdul Qadeer Khan (is) doing; the Soviets and Chinese; the British and the French; the Indians and the Israelis; stole the nuclear weapons designs previously in the past and no one questioned them but rather tend to be quiet. We are not stealing what they (illegally) stole in the past (as referring the nuclear weapon designs) but we're taking a small machine which is not useful for making the atomic bomb but for a fuel\". International pressure was difficult to counter at that time, and Bhutto, with the help of Munir Ahmad Khan and Aziz Ahmed, tackled the intense heated criticism and diplomatic war with the United States at numerous fronts—while the progress on nuclear weapons remained highly classified. During this pressure, Aziz Ahmed played a significant role by convincing the consortium industries to sell and export sensitive electronic components before the United States could approach to them and try and prevent the consortium industries to export such equipments and components. Bhutto slowly reversed and thwarted United States' any attempt to infiltrate the programme as he had expelled many of the American diplomatic officials in the country, under \"Operation Sun Rise\", authorised by Bhutto under \"ISI\". On the other hand, Bhutto intensified his staunch support and eye-blindly backed Abdul Qadeer Khan to quietly bring the Urenco's weapon-grade technology to Pakistan, keeping the Kahuta Laboratories hidden from the outside world. Regional rivals such as India and Soviet Union, had no basic intelligence on Pakistan's nuclear energy project during the 1970s, and Bhutto's intensified clandestine efforts seemed to be paid off in 1978 when the programme was fully matured.\n\nIn a thesis written in \"The Myth of Independence\", Bhutto argued that nuclear weapons would allow India to use its Air Force warplanes that with the use of small battlefield nuclear devices against the Pakistan Army cantonments, armoured and infantry columns and PAF bases and nuclear and military industrial facilities. The Indian Air Force would not meet with an adverse reaction from the world community as long as civilian casualties could be kept to a minimum. This way, India would defeat Pakistan, force its armed forces into a humiliating surrender and occupy and annexe the Northern Areas of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. India would then carve up Pakistan into tiny states based on ethnic divisions and that would be the end of the \"Pakistan problem\" once and for all.\n\nBy the time Bhutto was ousted, this crash programme had fully matured in terms of technical development as well as scientific efforts. By the 1977, PAEC and KRL had built their uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing plants, and selection for test sites, at Chagai Hills, was done by the PAEC. The feasibility reports were submitted by both organisations on their works. In 1977, the PAEC's Theoretical Physics Group had finished the designing of the first fission weapon, and KRL scientists succeeded in electromagnetic isotope separation of Uranium fissile isotopes. In spite of this, still little had been done in the development of weapons, and Pakistan's nuclear arsenal were actually made by General Zia-ul-Haq's military regime, under the watchful eyes of several Naval admirals, Army and Air Force's generals including Ghulam Ishaq Khan. In 1983, Bhutto's decision later proved to be right, when PAEC had conducted a cold test, near Kirana Hills, evidently made from non-fissioned plutonium. It has been speculated recently in the press that Dr. Khan's uranium enrichment designs were used by the Chinese in exchange for (UF) and some highly enriched weapons grade uranium. Later on this weapons grade uranium was offered back to the Chinese as the Pakistanis used their own materials. In all, Bhutto knew that Pakistan had become a nuclear weapon state in 1978 when his friend Munir Ahmad Khan paid a visit to him in his jail cell. There, Munir Ahmad Khan told Bhutto that the process of weapon designing is finished and a milestone in the complex and difficult enrichment of weapon-grade fuel has been achieved by the PAEC and dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan of ERL. Bhutto called for an immediate nuclear test to be conducted, no response was issued by General Zia or any member of his government.\n\nBhutto was sworn in as the prime minister of the country on 14 August 1973, after he had secured 108 votes in a house of 146 members. Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry was elected as the president under the new constitution. During his five years of government, the Bhutto government made extensive reforms at every level of government. Pakistan's capital and Western reforms that were begun and built in 1947 throughout the 1970s, were transformed and replaced with Socialist system. His policies were seen people friendly, but it did not produce long-lasting effects as the civil disorder against Bhutto began to take place in 1977.\n\nBhutto is considered the main architect of 1973 constitution as part of his vision to put Pakistan to road to parliamentary democracy. One of the major achievements in Bhutto's life was drafting of Pakistan's first ever consensus constitution to the country. Bhutto supervised the promulgation of 1973 constitution that triggered an unstoppable constitutional revolution through his politics wedded to the emancipation of the downtrodden masses, by first giving people a voice in the Parliament, and introducing radical changes in the economic sphere for their benefit .\n\nDuring his period in office the government carried out seven major amendments to the 1973 Constitution. The First Amendment led to Pakistan's recognition of and diplomatic ties with Bangladesh. The Second Amendment in the constitution declared the Ahmadis as non-Muslims, and defined the term non-Muslim. The rights of the detained were limited under the Third Amendment while the powers and jurisdiction of the courts for providing relief to political opponents were curtailed under the Fourth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment passed on 15 September 1976, focused on curtailing the power and jurisdiction of the Judiciary. This amendment was highly criticised by lawyers and political leaders. The main provision of the Sixth Amendment extended the term of the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and the High Courts beyond the age of retirement. This Amendment was made in the Constitution to favour the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who was supposed to be a friend of Bhutto.\n\nThe Bhutto government carried out a number of reforms in the industrial sector. His reforms were twofold: nationalisation, and the improvement of workers' rights. In the first phase, basic industries like steel, chemical and cement were nationalised. This was done in 1972. The next major step in nationalisation took place on 1 January 1974, when Bhutto nationalised all banks. The last step in the series was the nationalisation of all flour, rice and cotton mills throughout the country. This nationalisation process was not as successful as Bhutto expected. Most of the nationalised units were small businesses that could not be described as industrial units, hence making no sense for the step that was taken. Consequently, a considerable number of small businessmen and traders were ruined, displaced or rendered unemployed. In the concluding analysis, nationalisation caused colossal loss not only to the national treasury but also to the people of Pakistan.\n\nThe Bhutto government established a large number of rural and urban schools, including around 6,500 elementary schools, 900 middle schools, 407 high schools, 51 intermediate colleges and 21 junior colleges. Bhutto also abandoned the Western education system and most of the literature was sent back to Western world; instead his government encouraged the local academicians to publish books on their respected fields. Though the local books were made cheaper to the public, these reforms came with controversy. His government made Islamic and Pakistan studies compulsory in schools. Book banks were created in most institutions and over 400,000 copies of text-books were supplied to students.\n\nBhutto is credited for establishing the world class Quaid-e-Azam University and Allama Iqbal Open University in Islamabad in 1974, as well as establishing Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan in 1973. In his role as Foreign Minister, and in 1967 with the help of Abdus Salam, established the Institute of Theoretical Physics. As Prime Minister, Bhutto made revolutionary efforts to expand the web of education. Bhutto established the Allama Iqbal Medical College in 1975. In 1974, with the help of Abdus Salam, Bhutto gave authorisation of the International Nathiagali Summer College on Contemporary Physics (INSC) at the Nathiagali and as even as of today, INSC conference is still held on Pakistan, where thousands of scientists from all over the world are delegated to Pakistan to interact with Pakistan's academic scientists. In 1976, Bhutto established the Engineering Council, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Pakistan Academy of Letters and Cadet college Razmak in North Waziristan. A further four new Universities which have been established at Multan, Bahawalpur, and Khairpur. The People's Open University is another innovative venture which has started functioning from Islamabad. The Government's Education Policy provides for the remission of fees and the grant of a number of scholarships for higher education to the children of low-paid employees\n\nSeven thousand new hostel seats were planned to be added to the existing accommodation after the 1977 election. Bhutto said in 1975 he was aware \"of the difficulties and deficiencies faced by college students in many of the existing hostels. Directions have, therefore, been issued that fans, water-coolers and pay-telephones must be provided in each and every hostel in as short a time as physically possible.\"\n\nDuring his period as prime minister, a number of land reforms were also introduced. The important land reforms included the reduction of land ceilings and introducing the security of tenancy to tenant farmers. The land ceiling was fixed to of irrigated land and of non-irrigated land. Another step that Bhutto took was to democratise Pakistan's Civil Service. In Balochistan, the pernicious practice of Shishak and Sardari System was abolished. In 1976, the Bhutto government carried out the establishment of Federal Flood Commission (FFC), and was tasked to prepare national flood protection plans, and flood forecasting and research to harness floodwater.<ref name=\"Dawn News Papers, 2010/08/24\"></ref> Bhutto later went on to upgrade a number of dams and barrages built in Sindh Province.\n\nBhutto was a strong advocate of empowering small farmers. He argued that if farmers were weak and demoralised then Pakistan's agricultural strength would be fragile, believing that farmers would not feel psychologically safe unless the country achieved self-sufficiency in food. Therefore, the Bhutto government launched programs to put the country on road to self-sufficiency in rice hulling, sugar-milling and wheat husking industries. Bhutto's government intensified the control of rice hulling, sugar and wheat husking factories, initially believing that public sector involvement would reduce the influence of multi-national corporations creating monopolies. The Government initiated schemes for combating water logging and salinity. Tax exceptions were also introduced for small landowners to encourage the growth of agriculture. His nationalisation of Sindh-based industries heavily benefited the poor, but badly upset the influential feudal lords.\n\nBhutto introduced socialist economics policies while working to prevent any further division of the country. Major heavy mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering industries were immediately nationalised by Bhutto, and all of the industries came under direct control of government. Industries, such as KESC were under complete government control with no private influence in KESC decision. Bhutto abandoned Ayub Khan's state capitalism policies, and introduced socialist policies in a move to reduce the rich get richer and poor get poorer ratio. Bhutto also established the Port Qasim, Pakistan Steel Mills, the Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) and several cement factories. However, the growth rate of economy relative to that of the 1960s when East Pakistan was still part of Pakistan and large generous aid from the United States declined, after the global oil crises in 1973, which also had a negative impact on the economy. Despite the initiatives undertaken by Bhutto's government to boost the country's economy, the economical growth remained at equilibrium level. But Bhutto's policy largely benefited the poor and working class when the level of absolute poverty was sharply reduced, with the percentage of the population estimated to be living in absolute poverty falling from 46.50% by the end of 1979–80, under the General Zia-ul-Haq's military rule, to 30.78%. The land reform programme provided increased economic support to landless tenants, and development spending was substantially increased, particularly on health and education, in both rural and urban areas, and provided \"material support\" to rural wage workers, landless peasants, and urban wage workers.\n\nBhutto's nationalisation policies were initiated with an aim to put workers in control of the tools of production and to protect workers and small businesses. However, economical historians argued that the nationalisation program initially effected the small industries and had devastating effects on Pakistan's economy shrunk Bhutto's credibility. Conservative critics believed the nationalisation policies had damaged investor's confidence and government corruption in nationalised industries grew, although no serious corruption cases were ever proved against Bhutto by the military junta. In 1974, Bhutto maintained that foreign companies and industries in Pakistan were except from nationalisation policies and his government would be willing to receive foreign investment to put up factories. While commenting on his policies in 1973, Bhutto told the group of investors that belonged to the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) that \"activity of public sector or state sector prevents the concentration of economic power in few hands, and protects the small and medium entrepreneurs from the clutches of giant enterprises and vested interests\".\n\nBhutto's shift away from some socialist policies badly upset his democratic socialist alliance and many in the Pakistan Peoples Party, many of his colleagues, most notable Malik Mirage left Bhutto and departed to Soviet Union after resigning from Law Minister. Continuous disagreement led the government's socialist alliance to collapse and further uniting with secular Independence Movement led by Asghar Khan.\n\nAs part of his investment policies, Bhutto founded the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC). In July 1973, this financial institute began operation with an initial government investment of 100 million PRs. It aim was finance public sector industrial enterprises but, later on, its charter was modified to provide finance to the private sector as well. The NDFC is currently the largest development finance institution of Pakistan performing diversified activities in the field of industrial financing and investment banking. 42 projects financed by NDFC have contributed Rs. 10,761 million to Pakistan's GDP and generated Rs. 690 million after-tax profits and 40,465 jobs. By the mid-1990s NDFC had a pool of resources amounting to US $878 million The Bhutto government increased the level of investment, private and public, in the economy from less than Rs. 7,000 million in 1971–72 to more than Rs. 17,000 million in 1974–75.\n\nBanking reforms were introduced to provide more opportunities to small farmers and business such as forcing banks to ensure 70% of institutional lending should be for small land holders of 12.5 acres or less, which was a revolutionary idea at a time when banks only clients were the privileged classes. The number of bank branches rose by 75% from December 1971 to November 1976, from 3,295 to 5,727. It was one of the most radical move made by Bhutto, and the Bank infrastructure was expanded covering all towns and villages with a population of 5,000 in accordance with targets set after the nationalisation of banks.\n\nBy end of the Bhutto government concentration of wealth had declined compared to height of the Ayub Khan era when 22 families owned 66% of industrial capital, and also controlled banking and 97% of insurance.\n\nMeasures taken in the first few months of 1972 set a new framework for the revival of the economy. The diversion of trade from East Pakistan to international markets was completed within a short period. By 1974, exports exceeded one billion dollars, showing a 60% increase over the combined exports of East and West Pakistan before separation, it was achieved and benefited with world was in the midst of the major 1973 oil crisis and in the middle of global recession\nthe national income of Pakistan increased by 15% and industrial production by as much as 20% in four years.\n\nFollowing the secession of East Pakistan, calls for the independence of Balochistan by Baloch nationalists grew immensely. Surveying the political instability, Bhutto's central government sacked two provincial governments within six months, arrested the two chief ministers, two governors and forty-four MNAs and MPAs, obtained an order from the Supreme Court banning the National People's Party on the recommendation of Akbar Bugti, and charged everyone with high treason to be tried by a specially constituted Hyderabad tribunal of hand-picked judges.\n\nIn January 1973, Bhutto ordered the Pakistan Armed Forces to suppress a rising insurgency in the province of Balochistan. He dismissed the governments in Balochistan and the North-West Frontier Province once more. Following the alleged discovery of Iraqi arms in Islamabad in February 1973, Bhutto dissolved the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan. The operation, under General Tikka Khan, soon took shape in a five-year conflict with the Baloch separatists. The sporadic fighting between the insurgency and the army started in 1973 with the largest confrontation taking place in September 1974. Later on, Pakistan Navy, under Vice-Admiral Patrick Julius Simpson, also jumped in the conflict as it had applied naval blockades to Balochistan's port. The Navy began its separate operations to seized the shipments sent to aid Baloch separatists. Pakistan Air Force also launched air operations, and with the support of navy and army, the air force had pounded the mountainous hidden heavens of the Separatists. The Iranian military, also fearing a spread of the greater Baloch resistance in Iran, aided the Pakistani military as well. Among Iran's contribution were 30 Huey cobra attack helicopters and $200 million in aid.\n\nIraq under Sunni President Saddam Hussein sent Iraqi made weapons to Pakistan's warm water ports. Pakistan's navy mounted an effective blockade. Saddam's government provided support for Baluchi separatists in Pakistan, hoping their conflict would spread to rival Iran. In 1973, Iraq provided the Baluchis with conventional arms, and it opened an office for the Baluchistan Liberation Front (BLF) in Baghdad. This operation was supposed to be covert, but in 1973, the operation was exposed by M.I. when senior separatist leader Akbar Bugti defected to Bhutto, revealing a series of arms stored in the Iraqi Embassy. On the midnight of 9 February 1973, Bhutto launched an operation to seize control of the Iraqi Embassy, and preparation for siege was hastily prepared. The operation was highly risky and a wrong step could have started a war between the two countries. The operation was carefully analysed and at 0:00hrs (12:00 am), the SSG Division accompanied by Army Rangers stormed the Embassy. Military Police arrested the Iraqi Ambassador, the military attaché, and Iraq's diplomatic staff. Following the incident, authorities discovered 300 Soviet sub-machine guns with 50,000 rounds of ammunition and a large amount of money that was to be distributed amongst Baluchi separatist groups. Bhutto was angered and frustrated. Without demanding an explanation, he ordered the Military Police to immediately expel the Iraqi Ambassador and his staff as persona non grata on the first available flight.\n\nThe government announced the Iraqi plan to further dismember the country, and Bhutto's successful diplomatic offensive against Iraq isolated Saddam internationally with global condemnation. This incident caused Pakistan to support Iran during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and the U.S. invasion of Iraq against Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nIn order to avoid a replay of the East-Pakistan war, Bhutto launched economic and political reforms in the midst of the conflict. Bhutto government abolished the feudal system, the feudal lords continued to appropriate to themselves a generous share of government developmental funds whilst at the same time, they opposed and blackmailed the government whenever they could. Gradually the tribesmen started coming out of the Sardars' quarantine. Modern amenities, for instance medical aid, automobiles for passenger transport and schooling of children became available in the interior of Baluchistan for the first time, since 1947. The Bhutto government also constructed 564 miles of new roads, including the key link between Sibi and Maiwand creating new trade and commerce centres.\n\nBhutto government gave the right of a passport to every citizen of Pakistan and facilitated millions of skilled and non-skilled Pakistanis to seek employment in the Middle Eastern countries through a signing a number combination of bilateral agreements. From Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, alone 35,000 workers were given the opportunity to work in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Bhutto used the Pakistani community of London to lobby and influence European governments to improve the rights of expatriate Pakistani communities in Europe. The remittances from overseas Pakistanis, which now total around $US25 billion per annum, constitute a dependable source of foreign exchange for Pakistan.\n\nThe labour policy was among one of the most important cornerstone of Bhutto's government and a comprehensive labour reforms initiated by the Bhutto government. Shortly after assuming control, Bhutto's government imposed some conditions on the dismissal of workers. In 1973, the government instituted Labour Courts for the speedy redress of workers' grievances and the government also introduced a scheme for workers' participation in management, through the nationalisation policy. This scheme provided for 20% participation by workers in management committees set up at factory level. The Government abolished the workers' contribution to the Social Security Fund; instead, the employers were made to increase their contribution from 4 to 6%. The government enhanced compensation rates under the Worker's Compensation Act.\n\nIn 1972 the Bhutto government initially provided for some old age benefits for workers through group insurance, increased rates of compensation and higher rates of gratuity. However, the policy did not benefited immediately, therefore, the government introduced a pension scheme of old age benefits which would provide a payment of Rs.75 a month to workers after retirement at the age of 55 for men and 50 for women, on condition that the worker had completed a minimum of 15 years insurable employment. This applied to all factories, industries, and establishments employing ten or more workers drawing monthly wages up to Rs. 1,000. Skilled workers who become invalid after five years of insurable employment were also made entitled to benefits under this scheme.\n\nBhutto did not want to go for the western model where workers generally contribute along with the employers towards their old age benefits. In view of Pakistan's conditions, Bhutto's government did not wish the financial burden of this scheme to fall even partly on the worker. It was decided that the scheme be founded through a contribution from employers to the extent of 5% of the wage bill.\n\nAfter assuming power, Bhutto sought to diversify Pakistan's relations away from the United States and, soon Pakistan left CENTO and SEATO. Bhutto developed close and strengthened the Arab relations, and Sino-Pak relations. Bhutto in believed an independent Foreign Policy which had hitherto been the hand maiden of the Western Power, particularly independent from the United States' sphere of influence. With Bhutto as Foreign minister, and Prime minister, Pakistan and Iran had cemented a special relationship, as Iran had provided military assistance to Pakistan. The Sino-Pak relations were immensely improved, and Pakistan, under Bhutto, had built a strategic relationship with People's Republic of China, when PRC was isolated. In 1974, Bhutto hosted the second Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in 1974 where he delegated and invited leaders from the Muslim world to Lahore, Punjab Province of Pakistan. Bhutto was a strong advocate of Afro-Asian Solidarity and had cemented ties with Afro-Asian and Islamic countries and by 1976 had emerged as the Leader of the Third World .\n\nBhutto sought a peace agreement—Simla Agreement—with Indira Gandhi, Premier of India, and brought back 93,000 P.O.Ws to Pakistan and secured held by India with out compromising on Kashmir stance or recognising Bangladesh which were the key Indian demands. Negotiating with a power that has dismembered the country was an open-challenge to Bhutto who smoothly convinced India to return the territory and the POWs back to Pakistan. Before this conference, Bhutto and his colleagues did the comprehensive homework as Bhutto had realised that Arabs had still not succeeded in regaining territory lost in the 1967 war with Israel. Therefore, capturing of land does not cry out for international attention the same way as the prisoners do. According to Benazir Bhutto, Bhutto demanded the control of the territory in the first stage of the Agreement which surprised and shocked the Indian delegation. In Bhutto's point of view, the POW problem was more of a humanitarian problem that could be tackled at any time, but the territorial problem was something that could be integrated in India as time elapses. Indian Premier Gandhi was stunned and astonished at Bhutto's demand and reacted immediately by refusing Bhutto's demand. However, Bhutto calmed her and negotiated with economic packages dealt with Gandhi. Bhutto's knowledge and his intellectualism impressed Gandhi personally that Gandhi agreed to give the territory back to Bhutto in a first stage of the agreement. Signing of this agreement with Pakistan paying small price is still considered Bhutto's one of the huge diplomatic success.\n\nHis vast knowledge, intelligence, and keen awareness of post-World War II, and the nuclear history, enabled him to craft the foreign policy which brought unmatched undivideds in Pakistan's foreign policy history. Elements of his policy were continued by the successive governments to play a vital role in world's politics. In 1974, Bhutto and his Foreign minister Aziz Ahmed brought a U.N. resolution, recommending and calling for the establishment of nuclear-weapon free zone in South Asia, whilst he and Aziz Ahmed aggressively attacked the Indian nuclear programme. While Abdul Qadeer Khan was tasked with bringing the gas-centrifuge technology through the means of atomic proliferation, the goal of the resolution was achieved when Bhutto put India on the defensive position and promoted Pakistan as a non-proliferationist.\n\nSince the 1960s, Bhutto had been an anti-SEATO and preferred a non-aligned policy. Soon after assuming the office, Bhutto took a lengthy foreign trip to South East Asia, seeking closer and tighter relations with Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Burma, and North Korea. His policy largely followed a tight and closer relations with China, normalised relationships with Soviet Union, built an Islamic bloc, and advocated a creation of new economical alliance largely benefiting the third and second world countries.\n\nAll of these initiations and implications had disastrous effects on Japan, prompting Japan to oppose Bhutto, although Bhutto was a great admirer of Japan even though Japan was not a constituent part of Bhutto's foreign policy. In the 1970s, Japan made several attempts to get close to Bhutto, sending its military officials, scientists, and parliamentary delegations to Pakistan. Hence Japan went far by condemning India for carrying out a nuclear test, \"Smiling Buddha\", in 1974, and publicly supported Pakistan's non-nuclear weapon policy and pledged to build several new nuclear power plants. In 1970, Bhutto advised Japan not to be party of NPT, but Japan signed it but later regretted for not being properly progressed.\n\nIn Bhutto's view, Japan had been under the United States' influence, and much bigger role of Japan in Asia would only benefit American interests in the region. By the 1970s, Japan completely lost its momentum in Pakistan as Pakistan followed a strict independent policy. Bhutto envisioned Pakistan's new policy as benefiting the economic relations rather than the military alliance which also affected Japan's impact on Pakistan. However, much of the foreign policy efforts were reverted by General Zia-ul-Haq and ties were finally restored after Bhutto's execution.\n\nBhutto sought to improve Pakistan's ties with the Arab world, and sided with the Arab world during the Arab-Israeli conflict. Colonel Gaddafi of former Socialist Libya considered Bhutto as one of his greatest inspirations and was said to be very fond of Bhutto's intellectualism. In 1973, during the Yom Kippur War, Pakistan's relations with the Arab world represented a watershed. In both Pakistan and the Arab world, Pakistan's swift, unconditional and forthright offer of assistance to the Arab states was deeply appreciated.\nIn 1974, pressured by other Muslim nations, Pakistan eventually recognised Bangladesh as Mujib stated he would only go to the OIC conference in Lahore if Pakistan recognised Bangladesh. Pakistan established full diplomatic relations with Bangladesh on 18 January 1976 and relations improved in the following decades. Bhutto aided the Syrian and Egyptian Air Force by sending the Pakistan Air Force and Navy's top fighter pilots where they flew combat missions against Israel. However, Iraq was not benefited with Bhutto policies.\n\nIn early 1977, Bhutto decided to use \"ISI\" to provide the credible intelligence on Iraqi nuclear program that Pakistan and the \"ISI\" had secretly gained. The government passed intel that identified Iraqi nuclear program and the Osirak Nuclear Reactor at Osirak to Israel's \"Mossad\". Helping Israel to infiltrate Iraqi nuclear program was also continued by General Zia-ul-Haq as their policy to teach Iraq and Saddam Hussein a lesson for supporting the Baloch liberation fronts and movements.\n\nIn 1974, India carried out a nuclear test, codenamed \"Smiling Buddha\", near Pakistan's eastern border. Bhutto unsuccessfully lobbied for the United States to impose economic sanctions on India. However, at the request of Bhutto, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States convened a meeting with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Kissinger told Pakistan's ambassador to Washington that the test is \"\"a fait accompli and that Pakistan would have to learn to live with it\",\" although he was aware this was a \"little rough\" on the Pakistanis. In 1976, the ties were further severed with Bhutto as Bhutto had continued to administer the research on weapons, and in 1976, in a meeting with Bhutto and Kissinger, Kissinger had told to Bhutto, \"that if you [Bhutto] do not cancel, modify or postpone the Reprocessing Plant Agreement, we will make a horrible example from you\". The meeting was ended by Bhutto as he had replied: For my country's sake, for the sake of people of Pakistan, I did not succumb to that black-mailing and threats.\n\nAfter this meeting, Bhutto intensified Pakistan's foreign policy towards more onto Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, and sought to developed relations with both Soviet Union and the United States. Bhutto was keenly aware of Great Britain's policy of \"divide and rule\", and American policy of \"unite and rule\". In 1974, Bhutto, as Prime minister, visited Soviet Union. Prime Minister Bhutto deliberately undertook to improve relations with the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc. Bhutto sought to developed and alleviated the Soviet–Pakistani relations, with Soviet Union established Pakistan Steel Mills in 1972. The foundation stone for this gigantic project was laid on 30 December 1973 by Bhutto. Facing inexperience for the erection work of the integrated steel mill, Bhutto requested Soviet Union to send its experts. Soviet Union sends dozens of advisors and experts, under Russian scientist Mikhail Koltokof, who supervised the construction of this integrated Steel Mills, with a number of industrial and consortium companies financing this mega-project.\n\nThe relationship with United States was at low point and severed as United States was opposing Pakistan's nuclear detterrence programme. Although, Richard Nixon enjoyed firmly strong relations with Bhutto and was a close friend of Bhutto, the graph of relation significantly went down under the Presidency of Jimmy Carter. Carter tightened the embargo placed on Pakistan and placed a pressure through the United States Ambassador to Pakistan, Brigadier-General Henry Byroade. The socialist orientation, and Bhutto's proposed left-wing theories, had badly upset the United States, further ringing bells of alarm in the United States as fearing Pakistan's loss as an ally in the Cold war. The leftists and Bhutto's policy towards Soviet Union was seen sympathetic and had built a bridge for Soviet Union to have gain access in Pakistan's warm water ports, that something both United States and Soviet Union had lacked. During the course of 1976 presidential election, Carter was elected as U.S. President, and his very inaugural speech Carter announced the determination to seek the ban of nuclear weapons. With Carter's election, Bhutto lost all links to United States administration he had through President Nixon. Bhutto had to face the embargo and pressure from the American President who was totally against the political objectives which Bhutto had set forth for his upcoming future plans. Carter indirectly announced his opposition to Bhutto, his ambition and the elections.\n\nAlthough, Carter placed an embargo on Pakistan, Bhutto under the technical guidance and diplomatic though Aziz Ahmed, succeeded to buy sensitive equipments, common metal materials, and electronic components, marked as \"common items\", hide the true nature of the intentions, greatly enhance the atomic bomb project, though a complete failure for Carter's embargo. In a thesis written by historian Abdul Ghafoor Buhgari, Carter keenly sabotaged Bhutto credibility, but did not wanted favoured his execution as Carter made a call to General Zia-ul-Haq to stop the act. Therefore, senior leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party reached out to different country's ambassadors and high commissioners but did not meet with the U.S. ambassador, as the leadership knew the \"noble\" part played by Carter and his administration. When Carter administration discovered Bhutto's act, the programme was reached to a well advanced level, and furthermore, had disastrous effect on SALT I Treaty which was soon collapse, a failure of President Carter to stop the atomic proliferation and arm race between Soviet Union and United States heightened.\n\nIn 1972, Bhutto initially tried to build friendly ties with Afghanistan but such attempts where rebuffed in 1973. In 1974, Afghanistan began covert involvement in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which became increasingly disturbing for Bhutto's government. Afghan President Dawood Khan's controversial Pashtunisation policies resulted in Pakistan with gruesome violence and civil disturbances. The \"ISI\" quickly pointed out that President Daud was providing safe havens and training camps to anti-Pakistan militants and its intelligence agency had been a main arm of supporting the actions inside Pakistan, including providing support to Baloch separatists. Therefore, Bhutto's government decided to retaliate, and Bhutto launched a covert counter-operation in 1974 under the command of Major-General Naseerullah Babar, who was then Director-General of the M.I. Directorate-General for Western Fronts (DGWI). According to General Baber, it was an excellent idea and it had hard-hitting impact on Afghanistan. The aim of this operation was to arm the Islamic fundamentalists and to instigate an attack in different parts of Afghanistan. In 1974, Bhutto authorised a covert operation in Kabul and the Pakistan Air Force and the members of AI and the \"ISI\" successfully extradited Burhanuddin Rabbani, Jan Mohammad Khan, Gulbadin Hekmatyar, and Ahmad Shah Massoud to Peshawar, amid fear that Rabbani may be assassinated. By the end of 1974, Bhutto gave final authorisation of covert operation to train Afghan mujaheddin to take on Daoud Khan's government. This operation was an ultimate success.\n\nBy 1976 Daud had become concerned about his country's over dependence on the Soviet Union and the rising insurgency, thereon on 7 June 1976, Bhutto paid a three-day state visit to Afghanistan, followed by five-day visit of Daud Khan to Pakistan on August's last week of 1976. On 2 March 1977, an agreement on the resumption of air communications between Afghanistan and Pakistan was reached, as relations continue to improve. Bhutto and Daud made an exchange of official visit to force Afghanistan to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border. However, these development were interrupted as Bhutto was removed and Daud Khan was also overthrown in a military coup shortly after. Western experts viewed Bhutto's policy as \"astute policy\" in regards to the border question clearly increased pressure of the Afghanistan and very likely helped stimulate Afghan governments move towards accommodation. Whilst the Deputy Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Samad Ghaus also admitted before the compromise Afghanistan had been heavily involved inside Pakistan.\n\nBhutto began facing considerable criticism and increasing unpopularity as his term progressed. Initially targeting the opposition leader Abdul Wali Khan and his National Awami Party (NAP), a democratic socialist party, the socialist and communist mass who gathered under Bhutto's leadership began to disintegrate, thus dividing and allying with secular fronts. Despite the ideological similarity of the two parties, clashes between them became increasingly fierce. This started with the federal government's ousting of the NAP provincial government in Balochistan for alleged secessionist activities, and ended with the ban on the NAP. Subsequently, much of the NAP top leadership was arrested, after Bhutto's confidant Hyatt Scherpaoi was killed in a Peshawar bomb blast. Another notable figure, Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman died due to a cardiac arrest while in the office. Between the 1974 and 1976, many of Bhutto's original members had left Bhutto due to political differences or natural death causes. In 1974, Bhutto's trusted Science Advisor Abdus Salam also left Pakistan when Parliament declared Ahmadiyyah Muslims as non-Muslims. With Salam's departure, the research on nuclear weapons slowed down the progress as Dr. Mubashir Hassan, now Bhutto's appointed Science Advisor, would focus on politics more than the science research. Many civil bureaucrats and military officers loyal to Bhutto were replaced by new faces. Bhutto found himself with new advisers and collaborators.\n\nDissidence also increased within the PPP and the murder of dissident leader Ahmad Raza Casuri's father led to public outrage and intra-party hostility as Bhutto was accused of masterminding the crime. Powerful PPP leaders such as Ghulam Mustafa Khar, former Governor of Punjab, openly condemned Bhutto and called for protests against his regime. The political crisis in the North-West Frontier Province and Balochistan intensified as civil liberties remained suspended and an estimated 100,000 troops deployed there were accused of human rights abuses and killing large numbers of civilians.\n\nOn 8 January 1977, the opposition organized into the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA)., a nine-party coalition against the government of Bhutto and his allies. Bhutto called fresh elections, but the PNA did not obtain a clear majority. The PNA faced defeat but did not accept the results, accusing their opponents of rigging the election. The dissidents ultimately claimed that 40 seats in the national assembly were rigged, and boycotted the provincial elections. In the face of the resulting low voter turnout, the PNA declared the newly elected Bhutto government as illegitimate. Hard-line Islamist leaders such as Maulana Maududi called for the overthrow of Bhutto's regime. Mubashir Hassan, Science Advisor of Bhutto, feared a possible coup against Bhutto. Hassan entered the dispute and made an unsuccessful attempt to reach an agreement with PNA. Most Islamists refused to meet with Hassan as they saw him as the architect of Bhutto's success. The same year, an intensive crackdown was initiated on the Pakistan Muslim League, a conservative front. The People's National Party's President and former Leader of the Opposition Khan Vali Khan saw Bhutto's actions as his last stand against PNA, the Armed Forces and Bhutto, including his colleagues, were isolated. In an open public seminar, Vali Khan quoted that \"There is one possible grave for two people ... let us see who gets in first\". The Federal Security Force allegedly either arrested or extrajudicially killed members of the Muslim League. Following this, amid protest and civil distress felt in Lahore, and People's Party lost the administrative control over the city.\n\nOn 3 July 1977, then-Major-General K.M. Arif secretly met Bhutto, revealing that the planning of a coup had been taking place in the General Combatant Headquarters (GHQ). At this secret meeting, General Arif encouraged Bhutto to \"rush the negotiation with the PNA, before its too late\". Intensifying political and civil disorder prompted Bhutto to hold talks with PNA leaders, which culminated in an agreement for the dissolution of the assemblies and fresh elections under a government of national unity. However, on 5 July 1977 Bhutto and members of his cabinet were arrested by troops under the order of General Zia. It is generally believed that the coup took place on the pretext of unrest despite Bhutto having reached an agreement with the opposition.\n\nBhutto had good intelligence within the Army, and officers such as Major-General Tajamül Hussain Malik were loyal to him until the end. However, General Zia-ul-Haq ordered a training programme with the officers from Special Air Service (SAS). General Zia-ul-Haq ordered many of Bhutto's loyal officers to attend the first course. However, classes for senior officers were delayed until the midnight. None of the officers were allowed to leave until late in the evening before the coup. During this time, arrangements for the coup was made.\n\nGeneral Zia announced that martial law had been imposed, the constitution suspended and all assemblies dissolved and promised elections within ninety days. Zia also ordered the arrest of senior PPP and PNA leaders but promised elections in October. Bhutto was released on 29 July and was received by a large crowd of supporters in his hometown of Larkana. He immediately began touring across Pakistan, delivering speeches to very large crowds and planning his political comeback. Bhutto was arrested again on 3 September before being released on bail on 13 September. Fearing yet another arrest, Bhutto named his wife, Nusrat, president of the Pakistan People's Party. Bhutto was imprisoned on 16 September and a large number of PPP leaders, notably Dr. Mubashir Hassan and activists were arrested and disqualified from contesting the elections. Observers noted that when Bhutto was removed from power in July 1977, thousands of Pakistanis cheered and were delighted.\n\nOn 5 July 1977 the military, led by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, staged a coup. Zia relieved prime minister Bhutto of power, holding him in detention for a month. Zia pledged that new elections would be held in 90 days. He kept postponing the elections and publicly retorted during successive press conferences that if the elections were held in the presence of Bhutto his party would not return to power again.\n\nUpon his release, Bhutto travelled around the country amid adulatory crowds of PPP supporters. He used to take the train from the south to the north, and en route would address public meetings at different stations. Several of these trains were late, some by days, in reaching their respective destinations and as a result Bhutto was banned from traveling by train. The last visit he made to the city of Multan in the province of Punjab marked the turning point in Bhutto's political career and ultimately, his life. In spite of the administration's efforts to block the gathering, the crowd was so large that it became disorderly, providing an opportunity for the administration to declare that Bhutto, along with Dr. Hassan, had been taken into custody because the people were against him and it had become necessary to protect him from the masses for his own safety.\n\nOn 3 September, the Army arrested Bhutto again on charges of authorising the murder of a political opponent in March 1974. A 35-year-old politician Ahmed Raza Kasuri and his family had been ambushed, leaving Kasuri's father, Nawab Muhammad Ahmad Khan Kasuri, dead. Kasuri claimed that he was the actual target, accusing Bhutto of orchestrating the attack. Kasuri later claimed that he had been the target of 15 assassination attempts. Bhutto's wife Nusrat Bhutto assembled a team of top Pakistani lawyers for Bhutto's defence, led by Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim, Yahya Bakhtiar and Abdulhafiz Pirzada. Bhutto was released 10 days after his arrest after a judge, Justice KMA Samdani, found the evidence to be \"contradictory and incomplete.\" As a result, Justice Samdani was immediately removed from the bench and placed at the disposal of the law ministry. Three days later Zia arrested Bhutto again on the same charges, this time under \"martial law.\" When the PPP organised demonstrations among Bhutto's supporters, Zia cancelled the upcoming elections.\n\nBhutto was arraigned before the High Court of Lahore instead of in a lower court, thus depriving him of one level of appeal. The judge who had granted him bail had been removed. Five new judges were appointed, headed by Chief Justice of Lahore High Court Maulvi Mushtaq Hussain. Hussain had previously served as Bhutto's Foreign secretary in 1965, and was alleged to have strongly disliked and distrusted Bhutto. Hussain was a not only a Zia appointee but hailed from his home Jullundur district.\n\nThe trial lasted five months, and Bhutto appeared in court in a dock specially built for the trial. Proceedings began on 24 October 1977. Masood Mahmood, the director general of the Federal Security Force (since renamed the Federal Investigation Agency), testified against Bhutto. Mahmood had been arrested immediately after Zia's coup and had been imprisoned for two months prior to taking the stand. In his testimony, he claimed Bhutto had ordered Kasuri's assassination and that four members of the Federal Security Force had organised the ambush on Bhutto's orders. The four alleged assassins were arrested and later confessed. They were brought into court as \"co-accused\" but one of them recanted his testimony, declaring that it had been extracted from him under torture. The following day, the witness was not present in court and the prosecution claimed that he had suddenly \"fallen ill\".\n\nBhutto's defence team fought the case efficiently and challenged the prosecution with evidence from an army logbook the prosecution had submitted. It showed that the jeep allegedly driven during the attack on Kasuri was not even in Lahore at the time. The prosecution had the logbook disregarded as \"incorrect\". During the cross-examination by the defence of witnesses, the bench often interrupted questioning. The 706-page official transcript contained none of the objections or inconsistencies in the evidence pointed out by the defence. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark called it a mock trial fought in a Kangaroo court. Having witnessed the trial, Clark later wrote:\n\nWhen Bhutto began his testimony on 25 January 1978, Chief Justice Maulvi Mushtaq closed the courtroom to all observers. Bhutto responded by refusing to say any more. Bhutto demanded a retrial, accusing the Chief Justice of bias, after Mushtaq allegedly insulted Bhutto's home province. The court refused his demand.\n\nOn 18 March 1978, Bhutto was declared not guilty of murder, but was sentenced to death.\nOn 12 March 1978, Bhutto's former Legal Minister, Abdul Hafiz Pirzada petitioned the Supreme Court for the release of Bhutto's Science Adviser, Mubashir Hassan, and to review Bhutto's death sentence based on the split decision. The Supreme Court denied Hassan's release because he was held by Military Police, but the court agreed to hear the arguments. After 12 days of proceedings, the Supreme Court concluded that the President of Pakistan can change a death sentence into life imprisonment. Pirzada filed an application to then-Chief Martial Law Administrator. However, General Zia-ul-Haq did not act immediately and claimed that the application had gone missing.\n\nEmotionally shattered, Pirzada informed Bhutto about the development and General Zia-ul-Haq's intention. Therefore, Bhutto did not seek an appeal. While he was transferred to a cell in Rawalpindi central jail, his family appealed on his behalf, and a hearing before the Supreme Court commenced in May. Bhutto was given one week to prepare. Bhutto issued a thorough rejoinder to the charges, although Zia blocked its publication. Chief Justice S. Anwarul Haq adjourned the court until the end of July 1978, supposedly because five of the nine appeal court judges were willing to overrule the Lahore verdict. One of the pro-Bhutto judges was due to retire in July.\n\nChief Justice S. Anwarul Haq presided over the trial, despite being close to Zia, even serving as Acting President when Zia was out of the country. Bhutto's lawyers managed to secure Bhutto the right to conduct his own defence before the Supreme Court. On 18 December 1978, Bhutto made his appearance in public before a packed courtroom in Rawalpindi. By this time he had been on death row for 9 months and had gone without fresh water for the previous 25 days. He addressed the court for four days, speaking without notes.\n\nThe appeal was completed on 23 December 1978. On 6 February 1979, the Supreme Court issued a guilty verdict, a decision reached by a bare 4-to-3 majority. The Bhutto family had seven days in which to appeal. The court granted a stay of execution while it studied the petition. By 24 February 1979 when the next court hearing began, appeals for clemency arrived from many heads of state. Zia said that the appeals amounted to \"trade union activity\" among politicians.\n\nOn 24 March 1979 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. Zia upheld the death sentence. Bhutto was hanged at Central Jail Rawalpindi, on 4 April 1979, and was buried in Village Cemetery at Garhi Khuda Baksh.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Bhutto's children Murtaza and Benazir worked on rallying the international support for the release of their father. Libya's Colonel Gaddafi sent his Prime minister Abdus Salam Jalloud on an emergency trip to Pakistan to hold talks with Pakistan's military establishment for the release of Bhutto. In a press conference, Jalloud told the journalists that Gaddafi had offered General Zia to exile him to Libya, and Prime minister Jalloud stayed in the Islamabad International Airport where the specially designated Presidential aircraft waited for Bhutto. However, after a week of staying at the airport, General Zia rejected Prime minister Jalloud's request and upheld the death sentence. Much of the Muslim world was shocked at Bhutto's execution. Before being hanged, Bhutto made a final speech and his last words were: \"Oh Lord, help me for... I am innocent.\"\n\nOn 4 April 1979, the day Bhutto was executed, \"The New York Times\" published its report after following the entire chronological events surrounding Bhutto's trial which stated in part \"The way they did it, (Bhutto).. is going to grow into a legend that will some day backfire.\"\n\nMany political analysts and scientists widely suspected that the riots and coup against Bhutto were orchestrated with the help of Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Government because of United States fears of Bhutto's socialist policies being seen as sympathetic to the Soviet Union, and said policies providing an opportunity to the Soviet Union to get involved in Pakistani politics. A former U.S. attorney general and human rights activist, Ramsey Clark, is quoted in the \"New York Times\" as saying:\n\nI do not believe in conspiracy theories in general, but the similarities in the staging of riots in Chile (where the CIA allegedly helped overthrow President Salvadore Allende) and in Pakistan are just too close. Bhutto was removed from power in Pakistan by force on 5 July, after the usual party on the 4th at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, with U.S. approval, if not more, by General Zia-ul-Haq. Bhutto was falsely accused and brutalized for months during proceedings that corrupted the Judiciary of Pakistan before being murdered, then hanged. As Americans, we must ask ourselves this: Is it possible that a rational military leader under the circumstances in Pakistan could have overthrown a constitutional government, without at least the tacit approval of the United States?.\n\nMany of Pakistan's political scientists and historians and leading U.S. experts such as Ramsey Clark believed that Bhutto's removal and his execution was a singular and most dramatic change in world politics and a major setback for the Soviet Union who failed to realize the effects of Bhutto's execution on its own future in advance. Bhutto's death not only was a turning point in the Cold War, it also turned out to be one of the critical points in world politics since World War II, and a breakthrough in global power alignment. Eight months after Bhutto's death, the Soviet Union invaded the Afghanistan Soviet Socialist Republic, setting up a war that severely impacted the Soviet economy and led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States emerging as the single most powerful country in the world.\n\nOn 2 April 2011, 32 years after Bhutto's trial and execution, the PPP (the ruling party at that time) filed a petition at the Supreme Court to reopen Bhutto's trial. At the \"Geo News\", senior journalist Iftikhar Ahmad aired a series of televised interviews with those who played a major and often controversial role in Bhutto's death. A legal team was organized by the Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani's cabinet seeking to reopen the trial. President Asif Ali Zardari gave his consent to the resulting presidential order named Article 186 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court taking up the petition on 13 April 2011. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry eventually presided the three-judge-bench (although it was expanded with law experts from four provinces of Pakistan), while Minister of Law Babar Awan counseled Bhutto's case.\n\nWith immediate effect, Babar Awan resigned as Law minister, even leaving the Justice ministry entirely in order to legally counsel Bhutto's case completely independently. In his noting remarks, Chief Justice Chaudhry praised and appreciated the move by the senior PPP leadership and remarked the gesture as \"historic\". In a crucial advancement, the Supreme Court ordered the decision on the legal status of Bhutto's execution to a to-be-formed larger bench.\n\nAfter a series of hearings at the Supreme Court, the case was adjourned and dismissed after the PPP approved the suspension of Babar Awan on 2 May 2012.\n\nBhutto married twice in his lifetime. His first marriage took place in 1943 when he married his cousin and first wife Shireen Amir Begum. In 1951, he married Begum Nusrat Ispahani on September 8, 1951. The couple had four children; Benazir, Murtaza, Sanam, Shahnawaz.\n\nThere was also news of an alleged affair between Bhutto and a Bengali girl named Husna Sheikh. According to some media reports, she was his secret wife.\n\nBhutto remains a controversial and largely discussed figure in Pakistan. While he was hailed for his nationalism, Bhutto was roundly criticized for intimidating his political opponents. By the time Bhutto was given the control of his country in 1971, Pakistan was torn apart, isolated, demoralized, and emotionally shattered after a psychological and bitter defeat at the hands of its bitter rival India. His political rivals had blamed his socialist policies for slowing down Pakistan's economic progress, as they caused poor productivity and high costs. However Bhutto and co countered that they were merely addressing the massive inequality built up over the Ayub Khan years.\n\nBhutto is blamed by some quarters for causing the Bangladesh Liberation War. In 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq released former general Yahya Khan from prison and his Lieutenant-General Fazle Haq gave him the honorary guard of honor when the former general died in 1980. After being released from house arrest after the 1977 coup Yahya said, \"It was Bhutto, not Mujib, who broke Pakistan. Bhutto's stance in 1971 and his stubbornness harmed Pakistan's solidarity much more than Sheikh Mujib's six-point demand. It was his high ambitions and rigid stance that led to rebellion in East Pakistan. He riled up the Bengalis and brought an end to Pakistan's solidarity. East Pakistan broke away.\" Other army men who lay blame for 1971 on Bhutto include future President Pervez Musharraf and East Pakistan's former Martial Law Administrator Syed Mohammad Ahsan. Bhutto is also often criticised for human-rights abuses in Baluchistan by hardline Islamists as well as conservatives. Bhutto's actions during the 1970s operation in Balochistan are also criticised for failing to bring about a lasting peace in the region.\n\nBhutto's international image is more positive, casting him as a secular internationalist. Domestically, despite the criticism, Bhutto still remains Pakistan's most popular leader. During his premiership, Bhutto succeeded in uniting all the parties in getting the 1973 constitution enacted. His determined and aggressive embrace of nuclear weapons for Pakistan has made him regarded as the father of Pakistan's nuclear-deterrence programme, which he pursued in spite of Pakistan's limited financial resources and strong opposition from the United States. In 2006, \"The Atlantic\" described Bhutto as demagogic and extremely populist, but still Pakistan's greatest civilian leader. Even though Henry Kissinger developed differences with Bhutto, in his 1979 memoir \"White House Years\" he conceded that Bhutto was \"brilliant, charming, of global stature in his perception, a man of extraordinary abilities, capable of drawing close to any country that served Pakistan`s national interests\".\n\nWhile, Bhutto's former Law Minister Mairaj Muhammad Khan described Bhutto as \"a great man but cruel\". His family remained active and influential in politics, with first his wife and then his daughter becoming leader of the PPP political party. His eldest daughter, Benazir Bhutto, was twice Prime Minister of Pakistan, and was assassinated on 27 December 2007, while campaigning for 2008 elections. While his son, Murtaza Bhutto, served as the Member Parliament of Pakistan, and was also assassinated in a controversial police encounter.\n\nRoedad Khan, former statesman who served under Bhutto, further wrote in his book, \"Pakistan—A dream gone sour\", that after 1971, Bhutto started extremely well, bringing the isolated, angered, apprehended, and dismembered nation back into her feet and gave the respectable place in the world, in a shortest period... With a gift of giving the nation a parliamentary system and furthermore the ambitious successful development of atomic bomb programme in a record time, are his greatest achievements in his life, for Pakistan and her people, but sadly deteriorated at the end\". Bhutto remains highly influential in country's public, scientific, and political circles; his name yet continues to resonate in Pakistan's collective memory.\n\nWith all the criticism and opposition, Bhutto remained highly influential and respected figure even after his death. Bhutto is widely regarded as being among the most influential men in the history of Pakistan. His supporters gave him the title \"Quaid-e-Awam\" (Leader of the people).\n\n\n\n\nTALEEM UPDATES\n"}
