It is situated to the south of Espanola, on the shore of Anderson Lake, just off Ontario Highway 6. Since it was founded, it has been the only place in northern Ontario that has offered Roman Catholic ministerial training to Aboriginal peoples in Canada.\n\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, there were efforts made in Canada to increase the number of permanent deacons. From 1972 until 1979, there was a diaconate training programme, run by the Jesuits, in northern Ontario. It was supported by the Bishop of Sault Sainte Marie Alexander Carter. It only lasted seven years, because of the fatigue of those travelling round offering training. It was decided that a permanent location was needed for the programme.\n\nMoney was raised to build a site. Funds came from the Jesuits, and the Roman Catholic dioceses of Sault Sainte Marie, Hearst and Thunder Bay. The centre was built by volunteers who also created a sawmill on site to help with the construction. It started in 1982. By 1984, the main building and the chapel were completed. In 1985, the remaining outlying buildings were finished. In June 1985, it was opened by Bishop Carter.\n\nAlthough its main purpose was to train men for the diaconate. The centre also trained women for the Diocesan Order of Women. Eventually, the Diocesan Order of Women changed to become Diocesan Order of Service, which both men and women could train for. In addition, monthly Ministries weekends are provided at the centre for Roman Catholics across northern Ontario.\n\nIn the 1990s, a group of First Nation people from the centre brought the nearby Heaven's Gate trail, back into usage. Originally, it was an old trade route used by their ancestors. It runs 40 kilometres across the spine of the La Cloche Mountain range.\n\nFrom the spirituality centre, the Jesuits travel out to serve various churches in the area, such as:\n\nAs well as the spirituality centre, the Jesuits serve the Anishinaabe also through the Holy Cross Church in the Wiikwemkoong Unceded Reserve.\n\nSt. Raphael Church is for the Sagamok Anishnawbek First Nation, a reserve, west of Sudbury, Ontario. The reserve is one of the largest in the region and has a population of 2,200. The reserve is spread across 27,000 acres. The church is a white brick building. The interior walls are white pine. Above the altar is a picture of Jesus Christ appearing in a First Nation person's vision.\n\nThe priest of St. Raphael Church also helps at the Our Lady of the Highway Church of the Serpent River First Nation in Cutler, Ontario. In 2001, the Serpent River community in Cutler consists of 289 people in 142 housing units. It is located by Lake Huron, 40 km east of Blind River, Ontario.\n\nWithin the M'Chigeeng First Nation in Manitoulin District is the Church of the Immaculate Conception. It is situated across the street from the Ojibwe Cultural Museum. The original church structure was founded in 1854, by a Fr. Fremiot, but has its roots in the Jesuit missions to the island in 1648–1650. In 1971, the original building was destroyed in a propane tank explosion. The new building, constructed in 1972, was influenced by the Second Vatican Council's decrees on liturgy. It is a round building, with a conical roof; the shape of a teepee. Inside the church, the stations of the cross were painted by Leland Bell.\n\nFrom the Immaculate Conception Church, the priest travels to Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, which serves the Catholic population of Gore Bay, Ontario. Gore Bay is one of the two incorporated towns in the Manitoulin District.\n\nThe priest from Immaculate Conception Church also travels to St. Joseph's Church in Sheshegwaning on the east coast of Manitoulin. It is situated close to the Kenjgewin Teg Educational Institute.\n\n\n"}

The first known occurrence of the symbol is on a green and white mosaic on a floor in Wewelsburg, a castle near Paderborn, Germany remodeled and expanded under Heinrich Himmler. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial sig runes, symbols employed as a logo by the \"Schutzstaffel\". All subsequent forms extend from this mosaic. Whether the symbol had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown. Its association with the occult concept of the \"black sun\" (and therefore also its name) developed from the influence of a popular German novel first published in 1991.\n\nIn 1933, Heinrich Himmler acquired Wewelsburg, a castle near Paderborn, Germany. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.\n\nA product of Himmler's remodeling, the symbol widely known today as the \"Black Sun\" consists of twelve circular sig runes on the floor of the structure's north tower (the \"Obergruppenführersaal\"). The intended significance of the image remains unknown, but the artist may have found inspiration from decorative Merovingian discs dating from the early medieval period (see \"Zierscheibe\"). The objects received notable discourse during the Nazi era.\n\nIn 1991, writer Russell McCloud published the popular novel \"Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo\" (German 'The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') which scholar Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke describes as an \"occult-Nazi thriller\". In the novel, McCloud links the Wewelsburg mosaic with the occult concept of the black sun, which had been introduced in the 1950s by the Landig Group as a replacement for the swastika and as a symbol for a mystic energy source that was supposed to renew the Aryan race. After the publication of the novel, the Wewelsburg symbol became popularly known as the \"Black Sun\".\n\nThe symbol has historically remained prominent in neo-Nazi occult circles, wherein it occurs frequently in print publications and on associated websites. However, the symbol also sees frequent use in many neo-Nazi, alt-right, and white nationalist more generally, as seen, for example, on imagery used by Vanguard America during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017. Additionally, the Azov Battalion, a National Guard of Ukraine regiment widely associated with neofascism, employs the symbol in an official capacity as an emblem element, along with the Wolfsangel.\n\nAlong with other symbols from the Nazi era such as the Wolfsangel, the sig rune, and the totenkopf, the black sun is used by adherents of the Church of Satan and other Satanists. According to scholar Chris Mathews:\n\nMathews notes that Satanists sometimes combine Nazi imagery, such as when the Church of Satan's online store sold Wolfsangel rings by presenting them before a Black Sun background. Mathews says, \"Despite the systematic exploitation of ambiguity, any denial that Nazi symbols are being used \"as\" Nazi symbols is both disingenuous and unconvincing.\"\n\nIn 2018, the symbol appeared on merchandise for Colombian pop singer Shakira's El Dorado World Tour. According to Live Nation Entertainment, \"The necklace Live Nation designed for Shakira’s ‘El Dorado World Tour’ was based on pre-Colombian imagery ... However, some fans have expressed concern that the design bears an unintentional resemblance to neo-Nazi imagery. We sincerely apologize for this inadvertent similarity and have permanently pulled the item from the tour collection\".\n\n\n"}

The model is contrasted with the correspondence theory of truth.\n\nA positive tenet is the idea that truth is a property of whole systems of propositions and can be ascribed to individual propositions only derivatively according to their coherence with the whole. While modern coherence theorists hold that there are many possible systems to which the determination of truth may be based upon coherence, others, particularly those with strong religious beliefs hold that the truth only applies to a single absolute system. In general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within the whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple formal coherence. For example, the coherence of the underlying set of concepts is considered to be a critical factor in judging validity. In other words, the set of base concepts in a universe of discourse must form an intelligible paradigm before many theorists consider that the coherence theory of truth is applicable.\n\nIn modern philosophy, the coherence theory of truth was defended by Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Harold Henry Joachim (who is credited with the definitive formulation of the theory). (However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the correspondence theory of truth.) In contemporary philosophy, several epistemologists have significantly contributed to and defended the theory, primarily Brand Blanshard (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times) and Nicholas Rescher.\n\nAccording to one view, the coherence theory of truth regards truth as coherence within some specified set of sentences, propositions or beliefs. It is the \"theory of knowledge which maintains that truth is a property primarily applicable to any extensive body of consistent propositions, and derivatively applicable to any one proposition in such a system by virtue of its part in the system\". Ideas like this are a part of the philosophical perspective known as \"confirmation holism\". Coherence theories of truth claim that coherence and consistency are important features of a theoretical system, and that these properties are \"sufficient\" to its truth. To state it in the reverse, that \"truth\" exists only within a system, and doesn't exist outside of a system.\n\nAccording to another version by H. H. Joachim (the philosopher credited with the definitive formulation of the theory, in his book \"The Nature of Truth\", published in 1906), truth is a \"systematic coherence\" that involves more than logical consistency. In this view, a proposition is true to the extent that it is a necessary constituent of a systematically coherent whole. Others of this school of thought, for example, Brand Blanshard, hold that this whole must be so interdependent that every element in it necessitates and even entails every other element. Exponents of this view infer that the most complete truth is a property solely of a unique coherent system, called the \"absolute\", and that humanly knowable propositions and systems have a degree of truth that is proportionate to how fully they approximate this ideal.\n\nPerhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is Bertrand Russell's. He maintained that since both a belief and its negation will, individually, cohere with at least one set of beliefs, this means that contradictory beliefs can be shown to be true according to coherence theory, and therefore that the theory cannot work. However, what most coherence theorists are concerned with is not all possible beliefs, but the set of beliefs that people actually hold. The main problem for a coherence theory of truth, then, is how to specify just this particular set, given that the truth of which beliefs are actually held can only be determined by means of coherence.\n\n"}

{"id": "24979563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24979563", "title": "Evolutionary baggage", "text": "Evolutionary baggage\n\nEvolutionary baggage is the part of the genome of a population that was advantageous in past individuals but is disadvantageous under the pressures exerted by natural selection today.\n\nGenes that may have been advantageous in the past may be critically unfit for individuals in today’s environment. Natural selection is not a perfect process; if an organism is “fit enough” to survive a particular environment and reproduce, its genes are passed on to the next generation. Some of these genes may increase an organism’s fitness while some may even be slightly disadvantageous. This seeming paradox is the origin of evolutionary baggage, which is the collectively inherited traits that evolved in a different environment from the present. In the case of humans, the result is a “Paleolithic” genome, which is not adapted to today’s environment and is contributing to “diseases of civilization,” including atherosclerosis and obesity. Other hypotheses link evolutionary baggage to genetic diseases. Since all organisms descended from a common ancestor, evolutionary baggage can be seen universally among organisms.\n\nIt is a fundamental biological concept that organisms are most fit if they eat the same diet which their evolution has adapted them to. Throughout history, humans adapted to a diet by living off the land. Today, humans maintain the same genes that have been evolved from our ancestors and adapted to the diet they consumed. This has created a mismatch between the modern diet and lifestyle (which has emerged in evolutionary terms very recently), and the diet and lifestyle to which the human body has slowly adapted to over thousands of years. This phenomenon can be considered evolutionary baggage because the deviation from the Paleolithic diet and lifestyle has led to “diseases of civilization” such as obesity, hypertension, and type II diabetes.\n\nThe human body adapted over time to crave calorie-dense foods and to store energy efficiently because our ancestors did not have abundant food; this is called the thrifty gene hypothesis. These adaptations are genetic baggage today, causing humans to store fat efficiently despite abundant food availability. This leads to obesity, which is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, studies have shown that consuming a Paleolithic-type diet rich in unprocessed foods and lean protein decreased blood pressure and cholesterol level while increasing glucose tolerance.\n\nAs a recessive gene, Sickle-cell disease is only present if homozygous, with no dominant gene to beat them out. Sickle-cell disease, originating in people living in tropical areas where malaria is prevalent, is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells.. The unusual shape and rigidity of these altered red blood cells reduces a cell’s ability to effectively travel with regular blood flow, occasionally blocking veins and preventing proper blood flow. Life expectancy is shortened for people with sickle-cell disease, though modern medicine has significantly lengthened the life expectancy of someone with this disease. As detrimental as the effects of sickle-cell disease seem, it also offers an unforeseen benefit; humans with the sickle-cell gene show less severe symptoms when infected with malaria, as the abnormal shape of blood cells caused by the disease hinder the malaria parasite’s ability to invade and replicate within these cells. It is possible to have the sickle-cell allele, but not have the disease, for example if heterozygous.\nMalaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease of humans and other animals, is a potentially deadly disease that causes fever, fatigue, nausea, muscular pain, coughing, and, in extreme cases, coma and death. Malaria is caused by parasitic protozoans transferred through mosquito saliva into a person’s circulatory system, where they travel to the liver to mature. Though eliminated in the U.S., there were an estimated 219 million documented cases of malaria in 2010 according to the World Health Organization.\nThe correlation between sickle-cell disease and malaria is a double-edged sword. Having a sickle-cell allele does limit the life expectancy of a person, however, the presence of sickle-cell genes reduces the detrimental effects of malaria should it be contracted. Natural selection allowed for the spreading of the sickle-cell gene in areas of high numbers of mosquitoes carrying malaria; those that weren't as susceptible to malaria were much more likely to live than those that were. Because malaria is not as prevalent as it once was, the benefits of sickle-cell have since eroded, leaving behind the detrimental effects of the disease.\n\nEvolutionary baggage from our ancestors may be causing disease in individuals today. In our ancestors, these phenotypes conferred selective advantage against harsh climate, infectious disease and scarce food. However, since these conditions are less common in today’s world, individuals with these phenotypes are at a selective disadvantage. This disadvantage has major implications in the area of health care because some of the diseases caused by evolutionary baggage are major contributors to the rising cost of health care in developed countries.\n\n"}

{"id": "41441053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41441053", "title": "Guessing", "text": "Guessing\n\nA guess (or an act of guessing) is a swift conclusion drawn from data directly at hand, and held as probable or tentative, while the person making the guess (the guesser) admittedly lacks material for a greater degree of certainty. A guess is also an unstable answer, as it is \"always putative, fallible, open to further revision and interpretation, and validated against the horizon of possible meanings by showing that one interpretation is more probable than another in light of what we already know\". In many of its uses, \"the meaning of guessing is assumed as implicitly understood\", and the term is therefore often used without being meticulously defined. Guessing may combine elements of deduction, induction, abduction, and the purely random selection of one choice from a set of given options. Guessing may also involve the intuition of the guesser, who may have a \"gut feeling\" about which answer is correct without necessarily being able to articulate a reason for having this feeling.\n\nPhilosopher Mark Tschaepe, who has written extensively on the scientific and epistemological role of guessing, has noted that there are often-overlooked \"gradations\" of guessing - that is, different kinds of guesses susceptible to different levels of confidence. Tschaepe defines guessing as \"an initial, deliberate originary activity of imaginatively creating, selecting, or dismissing potential solutions to problems or answers to questions as a volitional response to those problems or questions when insufficient information is available to make merely a deduction and/or induction to the solution or answer\". He objects to definitions that describe guessing as either forming a \"random or insufficiently formed opinion\", which Tschaepe deems too ambiguous to be helpful, or \"to instantaneously happen upon an opinion without reasoning\". Tschaepe notes that in the latter case, the guess might appear to occur without reasoning, when in fact a reasoning process may be occurring so quickly in the mind of the guesser that it does not register as a process. Tschaepe quotes the description given by William Whewell, who says that this process \"goes on so rapidly that we cannot trace it in its successive steps\".\n\nA guess that \"is merely a hunch or is groundless... is arbitrary and of little consequence epistemologically\". A guess made with no factual basis for its correctness may be called a wild guess. Jonathan Baron has said that \"[t]he value of a wild guess is l/N + l/N - l/N = l/N\", meaning that taking a true wild guess is no different than choosing an answer at random. Philosopher David Stove described this process as follows:\n\nIn such an instance, there not only is no reason for favoring \"heads\" or \"tails\", but everyone knows this to be the case. Tschaepe also addresses the guess made in a coin flip, contending that it merely represents an extremely limited case of guessing a random number. Tschaepe examines such guesses at greater length with the instance of guessing a number between 1 and 100, for which Tschaepe notes that the guesser \"has to look for clues that are specific to what or whom is ordering them to guess, as well as possible past scenarios that involved guessing numbers\", and once these are exhausted, \"there comes a point very early in the process wherein no other clue to an answer exists\". As an exemplary case of guessing that involves progressively more information from which to make a further guess, Tschaepe notes the game of Twenty Questions, which Tschaepe says is \"similar to guessing a number that the other person is thinking, but unlike guessing a number as a singular action... allows for combining abductive reasoning with deductive and inductive reasoning\".\n\nAn apparently unreasoned guess that turns out to be correct may be called a happy guess, or a lucky guess, and it has been argued that \"a 'lucky guess' is a paradigm case of a belief that does not count as knowledge\". In Jane Austen's \"Emma\", however, the author has the character, Emma, respond to a character calling a match that she made a \"lucky guess\" by saying that \"a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it\". As Tschaepe notes, William Whewell stated that certain scientific discoveries \"are not improperly described as happy Guesses; and that Guesses, in these as in other instances, imply various suppositions made, of which some one turns out to be the right one\".\n\nBy contrast, a guess made using prior knowledge to eliminate clearly wrong possibilities may be called an informed guess or an educated guess. Uninformed guesses can be distinguished from the kind of informed guesses that lead to the development of a scientific hypothesis. Tschaepe notes that \"[t]his process of guessing is distinct from that of a coin toss or picking a number\". It has also been noted that \"[w]hen a decision must be made, the educated guess of the experts will be the best basis for a decision — an educated guess is better than an uneducated guess\".\n\nAn estimate is one kind of educated guess, although often one that involves making a numerical determination, and using some knowledge of known or observable variables to determine the most likely number or range of numbers. A guess, however, may also be purely a matter of selecting one possible answer from the set of possible answers, with little or no basis for making the selection. Another kind of guessing is conjecture, particularly as used in mathematics to refer to a conclusion or proposition which appears to be correct based on incomplete information, but for which no proof has been found.\n\nTschaepe notes that \"guessing has been indicated as an important part of scientific processes, especially with regard to hypothesis-generation\". Regarding scientific hypothesis-generation, Tschaepe has stated that guessing is the initial, creative process involved in abductive reasoning wherein new ideas are first suggested. Following the work of Charles S. Peirce, guessing is \"a combination of musing and logical analysis.\"\n\nPeople learn to guess at an early age, and there are many guessing games played by children. In practice, children may find themselves in situations where \"guessing is the only strategy they have available to them\". In order to cope with these situations, children develop two abilities, \"(1) the ability to recognize situations in which guessing is the only reasonable strategy even though it provides no more than a gross estimate; (2) the ability to recognize that different levels of accuracy are possible and acceptable in different situations\".\n\nCertain kinds of exams, particularly those that involve multiple choice questions, attempt to penalize exam takers for guessing by giving a small negative score for each wrong answer, so that the average number of correct guesses will be offset by the combined penalty for the average number of incorrect guesses. In such a scenario, however, a guesser who can eliminate one or two wrong answers can still gain overall by guessing from the remaining pool of answers.\n\nGuessing has been asserted to be necessary in literary theory, where \"we have to guess the meaning of the text because the author's intention is beyond our reach\". Because the reader can never put themselves in exactly the situation the author was in when the text was written, to construe the meaning of the text \"is to make a guess\".\n\nA guessing game is a game in which the object is to use guessing to discover some kind of information, such as a word, a phrase, a title, or the identity or location of an object. A guessing game has as its core a piece of information that one player knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word. Charades is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on the type of communication to be given, such as \"Catch Phrase\", \"Taboo\", \"Pictionary\", and similar. The genre also includes many game shows such as \"Win, Lose or Draw\", \"Password\" and \"$25,000 Pyramid\".\n\nMany of the games are played co-operatively. In some games some player(s) know the answer, but cannot tell the other(s), instead they must help them to guess it. Guessing games are \"readily adaptable for classroom use\", as such a game \"creates just enough tension to remain exciting, challenging, and competitive\" for children, so long as the teacher designs effective rules \"to eliminate unruly or unsportsmanship behavior\". It has been noted, however, that children in therapy may initiate guessing games as a way to avoid talking about distressing issues, and that therapists who are using other kinds of games to facilitate communication should avoid being drawn into them.\n\nExamples of guessing games include:\n\n\n\nIn software testing, error guessing is a test method in which test cases used to find bugs in programs are established based on experience in prior testing. The scope of test cases usually rely on the software tester involved, who uses past experience and intuition to determine what situations commonly cause software failure, or may cause errors to appear. Typical errors include divide by zero, null pointers, or invalid parameters. Error guessing has no explicit rules for testing; test cases can be designed depending on the situation, either drawing from functional documents or when an unexpected/undocumented error is found while testing operations.\n\nA study of guessing in social situations (for example, guessing someone's test score or potential salary) determined that there are situations where it is beneficial to intentionally either overguess (guess a higher amount) or underguess (guess a lower amount). The study noted that students who knew the score they had received on a test were happier when another person who did not know the score guessed a lower number; the lower guess gave the student the positive feeling of having exceeded expectations.\n\n"}

B. S. Haldane in 1957, and clarified further by later commentators. \n\nIn the introduction to \"The Cost of Natural Selection\" Haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities, partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock; but, writes Haldane,\n\nespecially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle, one cannot cull even half the females, even though only one in a hundred of them combines the various qualities desired.\n\nThat is, the problem for the cattle breeder is that keeping only the specimens with the desired qualities will lower the reproductive capability too much to keep a useful breeding stock.\n\nHaldane states that this same problem arises with respect to natural selection. Characters that are positively correlated at one time may be negatively correlated at a later time, so simultaneous optimisation of more than one character is a problem also in nature. And, as Haldane writes\n\n[i]n this paper I shall try to make quantitative the fairly obvious statement that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they happen to be controlled by the same genes.\n\nIn faster breeding species there is less of a problem. Haldane mentions the peppered moth, \"Biston betularia\", whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several alleles at a single gene. One of these alleles, \"C\", is dominant to all the others, and any CC or Cx moths are dark (where \"x\" is any other allele). Another allele, \"c\", is recessive to all the others, and cc moths are light. Against the originally pale lichens the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the cc moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of cc moths might be halved.\n\nAnother potential problem is that if \"ten other independently inherited characters had been subject to selection of the same intensity as that for colour, only formula_1, or one in 1024, of the original genotype would have survived.\" The species would most likely have become extinct; but it might well survive ten other selective periods of comparable selectivity, if they happened in different centuries.\n\nHaldane proceeds to define the \"intensity of selection\" regarding \"juvenile survival\" (that is, survival to reproductive age) as formula_2, where formula_3 is the quotient of those with the optimal genotype (or genotype) that survive to reproduce, and formula_4 is the quotient for the entire population. The quotient of deaths formula_5 for the entire population would have been formula_6, if all genotypes had survived as well as the optimal, hence formula_7 is the quotient of deaths due to selection. As Haldane mentions, if formula_8, then formula_9 – since ln(1) = 0.\n\nHaldane writes\n\nI shall investigate the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change occurs in the environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, the introduction of a new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. But meanwhile, a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred. If selection at the formula_10 selected locus is responsible for formula_11 of these deaths in any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be formula_12 of that of the optimal genotype, or formula_13 nearly, if every formula_11 is small. Thus the intensity of selection approximates to formula_15.\n\nComparing to the above, we have that formula_16, if we say that formula_17 is the quotient of deaths for the formula_10 selected locus and formula_4 is again the quotient of deaths for the entire population.\n\nThe problem statement is therefore that the alleles in question are \"not\" particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows for more than one gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.\n\nThe total cost of substitution of the formula_10 gene is the sum formula_21 of all values of formula_11 over all generations of selection; that is, until fixation of the gene. Haldane states that he will show that formula_21 depends mainly on formula_24, the small frequency of the gene in question, as selection begins – that is, at the time that the environmental change occurs (or begins to occur).\n\nLet A and a be two alleles with frequencies formula_25 and formula_26 in the formula_27 generation. Their relative fitness is given by\n\nwhere 0 ≤ formula_28 ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.\n\nIf λ = 0, then Aa has the same fitness as AA, e.g. if Aa is phenotypically equivalent with AA (A dominant), and if λ = 1, then Aa has the same fitness as aa, e.g. if Aa is phenotypically equivalent with aa (A recessive). In general λ indicates how close in fitness Aa is to aa.\n\nThe fraction of selective deaths in the formula_27 generation then is\n\nand the total number of deaths is the population size multiplied by\n\nHaldane approximates the above equation by taking the continuum limit of the above equation. This is done by multiplying and dividing it by dq so that it is in integral form\n\nsubstituting q=1-p, the cost (given by the total number of deaths, 'D', required to make a substitution) is given by\n\nAssuming λ < 1, this gives\n\nwhere the last approximation assumes formula_24 to be small.\n\nIf λ = 1, then we have\n\nIn his discussion Haldane writes that the substitution cost, if it is paid by juvenile deaths, \"usually involves a number of deaths equal to about 10 or 20 times the number in a generation\" – the minimum being the population size (= \"the number in a generation\") and rarely being 100 times that number. Haldane assumes 30 to be the mean value.\n\nAssuming substitution of genes to take place slowly, one gene at a time over \"n\" generations, the fitness of the species will fall below the optimum (achieved when the substitution is complete) by a factor of about 30/\"n\", so long as this is small – small enough to prevent extinction. Haldane doubts that high intensities – such as in the case of the peppered moth – have occurred frequently and estimates that a value of \"n\" = 300 is a probable number of generations. This gives a selection intensity of formula_37.\n\nHaldane then continues:\n\nThe number of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.\n\nThe number 300 of generations is a conservative estimate for a slowly evolving species not at the brink of extinction by Haldane's calculation. For a difference of at least 1,000 genes, 300,000 generations might be needed – maybe more, if some gene runs through more than one optimisation.\n\nApparently the first use of the term \"Haldane's dilemma\" was by palaeontologist Leigh Van Valen in his 1963 paper \"Haldane's Dilemma, Evolutionary Rates, and Heterosis\".\n\nVan Valen writes:\n\nHaldane (1957 [= \"The Cost of Natural Selection\"]) drew attention to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.\n\nThat is, since a high number of deaths are required to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are \"N\" such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9 times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, it may not have reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.\n\nIn 1967 J. A. Sved found that the dilemma was based on wrong calculations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57271814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57271814", "title": "Harzreise im Winter", "text": "Harzreise im Winter\n\n\"Harzreise im Winter\" (‘\"Winter Journey in the Harz\"’) is a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, inspired by his ascent of the Brocken in the Harz mountains during the winter of 1777. He reached the summit in the heat of midday, in deep snow, with the landscape below him shrouded in cloud. The Brocken had always been a place of mystery, connected with witches and devils; where illusions such as the Brocken spectre might confuse an unwary traveller, and where few ventured by choice. This was the inspiration and the setting for his poem.\n\n\"Harzreise im Winter\" was the last of Goethe's works in his Sturm und Drang period, marking the end of a series of long, free-verse poems hymns by the young poet that had begun with ‘\"Wandrers Sturmlied\"’, and it is less self-absorbed than his earlier writing. It was first published in 1789 in the eighth volume of his works.\n\nGoethe wrote the poem during his first trip to the Harz when he spent two weeks on his own, with only local guides to accompany him, from 29 November to 14 December 1777. During this trip signed himself in hotel guest books as \"Johann Wilhelm Weber from Darmstadt\". On 16 November he had referred in his diary to a \"Project on the Secret Journey\", an undertaking that he described on 7 December in a letter to Frau von Stein as a \"pilgrimage\". On the first of December, several days before the ascent of the Brocken, he had already conceived of the opening words of the poem, “Like the vulture”. The 'pilgrimage' up the Brocken was intended to be the highlight of his trip, but as well as being considered dangerous, the weather conditions made it uncertain, and he was not able to make the ascent until 10 December. Many years later, in his autobiographical essay “Campaign in France”, he declared that he had seen a vulture \"in the gloomy snow-capped clouds that rose from the north\" on the Ettersberg, and that he had already begun the poem that day.\n\nThe original manuscript of the poem has not survived, so the earliest known version is a transcription by Philipp Seidel, attached to a letter to Johann Heinrich Merck dated 5 August 1778. Goethe did not include the work in his handwritten collection of texts which he put together in 1777 for Charlotte von Stein. He edited his early version for the eight volume of his writings in 1789, making some minor changes in the final stanza.\n\nThe work consists of 88 lines of free verse, divided into eleven stanzas of differing lengths. This was a common ode arrangement in the 18th century. It contains two key elements that were to become central to the discourse of the Romantics on winter travel – references to frosty, lifeless landscapes, and their intimate connection with the loneliness of the hero who had withdrawn into the wilderness in the face of some kind of crisis.\n\nThe poem opens with a stanza in which the poet likens his song to a hovering bird of prey looking down on the earth: The second to fifth stanzas contrast the fate of the lucky and those who struggle against misfortune, illustrating the difference in their experiences in terms of the landscape. Next, the poet's vision passes from the external into the internal perspective, illuminating the distress of the selfish and asking who heals the pain of \"the balm that became poison\" and of one \"who but hate for man / From the fullness of love hath drunk?\"\n\nIn the following stanza, the song invokes the \"Father of Love,\" who refreshes the heart of the sufferer and clears his \"clouded gaze\" so that a \"thousand springs\" are revealed to the \"thirsty / in the desert\". This plea is extended to the \"Brothers of the Hunt\" in the eighth stanza, so that they too may be blessed. The tenth stanza then asks for the lonely soul – the poet himself – to be wrapped in \"golden clouds\" and surrounded by \"winter green\". After a well-lit and sheltered ascent through \"the fords of the night,\" the poet reaches the \"dreaded summit\" and gazes in gratitude toward the overawing spectacle of nature.\n\nAfter his Harz journey, Goethe was ready to move on from the unrestrained forms of expression which characterised the Sturm und Drang. Later in life, he distanced himself from the sentiments of his earliest work, including ‘\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\"’, seeking measure and order instead. At the time ‘\"Harzreise im Winter\"’ was written however, ‘\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\"‘ continued to exert a strong influence on many young men. One of these was Friedrich Victor Leberecht Plessing, the prototype for the unfortunate person referred to in the poem as consumed in bitterness. He had been greatly influenced by Goethe's work and after studying theology and jurisprudence had returned to his parents’ house in Wernigerode, consumed with melancholy. Plessing had written to Goethe asking for advice in 1776, but Goethe had not replied to him. Goethe visited Plessing on his journey to the Harz on 3 December, but was unable to help him.\n\nIn his \"Campaign in France\", Goethe later described Plessing's unanswered letter as \"the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen in its self-tormenting manner.” In addition to Plessing there were others who sought his help, and whom Goethe supported - he said that he had also \"imposed\" on other young men whom he wanted to help along their way. However, many of those who sought Goethe's help would not have gone along with him on his \"path to a purer higher education,\" and would have held back his own self-development. Indeed, as much as \"Harzreise im Winter\" may allude to his encounter with Plessing, it is Goethe's own self-development that its main topic. He ascends the mountain to consult the oracle about his own fate, in other words to understand whether he is condemned to live the existence of the unfortunate, or whether he is to be redeemed by love.\n\nAgainst the background of his diary entries and letters, this spiritual and redemptive element is shown in a clear light. After the eagerly awaited climb up the Brocken, he wrote: \"cheerful, glorious moment, the whole world below in clouds and fog and above, everything cheerful\" and added the sentence: \"What is man that you are mindful of him?\", a quotation from the eighth Psalm which he had written down on the anniversary of his arrival in Weimar.\n\nThe poem is less descriptive than reflective, as the landscape mentioned in the title is only lightly sketched and exists mainly as the framework for an existential experience.\n\nThe poem opens with the image of a vulture flying high above the earth. Whether the bird he invokes was specifically a vulture if not is not entirely clear however - in Goethe's time the term “vulture” might encompass different birds of prey such as hawks or buzzards. The vulture was however a bird used in divination by the Romans, as Goethe knew. In this context, the vulture in the first stanza may link with the ideas of the second stanza - \"For a God hath / Unto each prescribed / His destined path.\"\n\nIt is this sense of finding one's destined path that rings through the solemn words of the last two stanzas. In the sense of Sturm und Drang, and the urge to deify nature, an encounter with the divine itself takes place, and the successful ascent of the summit becomes a symbolic ascension onto a higher plane of being. The language which conveys this is reminiscent of Goethe's earlier poem Ganymed; (\"Embrace the embracing! / Upwards to your bosom / loving Father!\").\n\nThe critic Albrecht Schöne has linked the evocation of the vulture in the first stanza and its oracular significance with Goethe's governmental activity, about which he still had very mixed feelings at the time. In the opinion of Jochen Schmidt however, the bird of prey is associated with the eagle found in Pindar's work. For him, the first stanza refers specifically to the third Nemean Ode and proclaims Goethe's self-assurance and the complex relationship between poetry and lived experience.\n\nThe image of the \"thirsty / in the desert\" in the seventh stanza is associated with the book of Isaiah. While the phrases \"mysterious-apparent\" and \"realms and majesty\" of the last stanza define the religious quality of the lyric language, they are somewhat detached from their core exegetical meanings in the Epistle to the Romans and the Epistle to the Colossians as well as from the Temptation of Christ in the Gospel of St Matthew.\n\nKlaus Weimar (1984), Michael Mandelartz (2006) and Sebastian Kaufmann (2010/11) have all developed interpretations of the poem which differ to some degree from the traditional view, with its emphasis on the biographical details of Goethe's life, and suggest that the voice of the poet need not be essentially bound up with Goethe's own.\n\nIn 1792, the composer Johann Friedrich Reichardt set some of the poem's words to music in his ‘\"Rhapsodie (Aus der Harzreise)\"’. The chosen text was substantially the same as Brahms' later and more famous composition, the ‘\"Alto Rhapsody\"’, with Reichardt setting sixteen lines and Brahms twenty-two.\n\nIn 1924, Ernst Barlach produced a series of lithographs to illustrate \"Harzreise im Winter\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37974207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37974207", "title": "Il Galateo", "text": "Il Galateo\n\nGalateo: The Rules of Polite Behavior (\"Il Galateo, overo de' costumi\") by Florentine Giovanni Della Casa (1503–56) was published in Venice in 1558. A guide to what one should do and avoid in ordinary social life, this courtesy book of the Renaissance explores subjects such as dress, table manners, and conversation. It became so popular that the title, which refers to the name of one of the author’s distinguished friends, entered into the Italian language as a general term for social etiquette. \n\nDella Casa did not live to see his manuscript’s widespread and lasting success, which arrived shortly after its publication. It was translated into French (1562), English (1576), Latin (1580), Spanish (1585), and German (1587), and has been read and studied in every generation. Della Casa's work set the foundation for modern etiquette writers and authorities on manners, such as “Miss Manners” Judith Martin, Amy Vanderbilt, and Emily Post.\n\nIn the twentieth century, scholars usually situated \"Galateo\" among the courtesy books and conduct manuals that were very popular during the Renaissance. In addition to Castiglione’s celebrated \"Courtier\", other important Italian treatises and dialogues include Alessandro Piccolomini’s \"Moral institutione\" (1560), Luigi Cornaro’s \"Treatise on the Sober Life\" (1558-1565), and Stefano Guazzo’s \"Art of Civil Conversation\" (1579). \n\nIn recent years, attention has turned to the humor and dramatic flair of Della Casa’s book. It has been argued that the style sheds light on Shakespeare’s comedies. When it first appeared in English translation by Robert Peterson in 1575, it would have been available in book stalls in Shakespeare's London. Stephen Greenblatt, author of \"Will in the World\", writes, \"To understand the culture out of which Shakespeare is writing, it helps to read Renaissance courtesy manuals like Baldassare Castiglione’s famous Book of the Courtier (1528) or, still better, Giovanni della Casa’s \"Galateo or, The Rules of Polite Behavior\" (1558, available in a delightful new translation by M.F. Rusnak). It is fine for gentlemen and ladies to make jokes, della Casa writes, for we all like people who are funny, and a genuine witticism produces “joy, laughter, and a kind of astonishment.” But mockery has its risks. It is perilously easy to cross a social and moral line of no return.\" \n\nDistinguished historians argue that \"Galateo\" should be read in the context of international European politics, and some contend that the work expresses an attempt to distinguish Italian excellence. “During the half-century when Italy fell prey to foreign invasion (1494-1559) and was overrun by French, Spanish and German armies, the Italian ruling classes were battered by - as they often envisaged them - \"barbarians\". In their humiliation and laboured responses, Italian writers took to reflecting on ideals, such as the ideal literary language, the ideal cardinal, ideal building types, and the ideal general or field commander. But in delineating the rules of conduct, dress and conversation for the perfect gentleman, they were saying, in effect, \"We are the ones who know how to cut the best figure in Europe\". \n\nA skilled writer in Latin, Della Casa followed Erasmus in presenting a harmonious and simple morality based on Aristotle’s \"Nicomachean Ethics\" and notion of the mean, as well as other classical sources. His treatise also reveals an obsession with graceful conduct and self-fashioning during the time of Michelangelo and Titian: “A man must not be content with doing good things, but he must also study to do them gracefully. Grace is nothing other than that luster which shines from the appropriateness of things that are suitably ordered and well arranged one with the other and together.” The work has been edited in this light by such distinguished Italian scholars as Stefano Prandi, Emanuela Scarpa, and Giorgio Manganelli.\n\nThe work may be read in the context of what Norbert Elias called the “civilizing process.” It is generally agreed that, given the popularity and impact of \"Galateo\", the cultural elite of the Italian Renaissance taught Europe how to behave. Giulio Ferroni argues that Della Casa “proposes a closed and oppressive conformity, made of caution and hypocrisy, hostile to every manifestation of liberty and originality.” Others contend, on the contrary, that the work represents ambivalence, self-control, and a modern understanding of the individual in a society based on civility, intercultural competence and social networking.\n\nDella Casa addresses gentlemanly citizens who wish to convey a winning and attractive image. With a casual style and dry humor, he writes about everyday concerns, from posture to telling jokes to table manners. “Our manners are attractive when we regard others’ pleasure and not our own delight,” Della Casa writes.\n\nUnlike Baldassare Castiglione’s \"The Book of the Courtier\", the rules of polite behavior in \"Galateo\" are not directed to ideal men in a Renaissance court. Instead, Della Casa observes the ordinary habits of people who do not realize that clipping one’s nails in public is bad. “One should not annoy others with such stuff as dreams, especially since most dreams are by and large idiotic,” we are advised.\n\nValentina D’Urso, Professor of Psychology and author of \"Le Buone Maniere\", writes, “The founding father of this literary genre, [Galateo] is an extraordinary read, lively and passionate. One doesn’t know whether to admire more its rich style or the wisdom of the practical words of advice.” \n\nThe work was preceded by a short treatise on the same subject in Latin, \"De officiis inter tenuiores et potentiores amicos\" (1546). Latin at the time was the language of learned society, and Della Casa was a first-rate classicist and public speaker. The treatise opens with a Latinate \"conciossiacosaché\", which gained Galateo a reputation for being pedantic and labored. However, Giuseppe Baretti and poets such as Giacomo Leopardi ranked Della Casa alongside Machiavelli as a master of Italian prose style. \"Una delle prose più eleganti e più attiche del secolo decimosesto,\" (one of the most elegant and Attic prose works of the sixteenth century) Leopardi said. Della Casa’s \"Galateo\" is, in the words of scholar E. H. Wilkins, “still valuable…for the pleasant ease with which most of it is written, and for its common sense, its plentiful humor, and its general amenity.”\n\nDella Casa frequently alludes to Dante and more often to Boccaccio, whose Decameron he evidently knew very well and whose style he imitates. Several comments on language in Galateo reflect the Tuscan language model proposed about the same time by Della Casa’s friend Pietro Bembo.\n\nIn the first chapter it is said that a gentleman should be at all times courteous, pleasant, and in manners beautiful. Although good manners may not appear as important as liberality, constancy, or magnanimity, they are nonetheless a virtue for achieving the esteem of others. \n\nOne must not mention, do, or think anything that invokes images in the mind that are dirty or disreputable. One should not reveal by one's gestures that said person has just returned from the bathroom, do not blow one's nose and look into the handkerchief, avoid spitting and yawning. \n\nDella Casa tells his reader that outward appearance is very important, so clothes must be tailored and conform to prevailing custom, reflecting one’s social status. \n\nIn Chapter 7, Della Casa deals with a pivotal subject - conversation: you have to talk about topics of interest to all present and show respect to everyone, avoiding anything that is base or petty. \n\nIn Chapter 14 of the way we talk about the places where you are with other people and the first thing that the author discusses types of ceremonies, false flatteries, and fawning behavior. Another matter is whether the ceremonies are made to us: never refuse because it could be taken as a sign of arrogance.\n\nDella Casa returns to illustrate the customs of conversation and public speaking. Language should, as much as possible, be \"orderly and well-expressed\" so that the listener is able to understand what the speaker intends. In addition to the clarity of the words used, it is also important that they sound pleasant. Before talking about any topic, it is good to have it formed in your mind. It is not polite to interrupt someone while talking, nor to help him find his words.\n\nIn the last three chapters, the author writes about behaviour in general: what you do should be appropriate and done with grace. A gentleman should never run, or walk too slowly. Della Casa brings us to behavior at the table, such as not scratching, not eating like a pig, not using a toothpick or sharing food. In Della Casa’s vision, slight slips of decorum become taboo.\n\nIt was probably first drafted during his stay at the Abbey of Saint Eustace at Nervesa, near Treviso, between 1551 and 1555. \"Galateo\" was first published in Venice, and was edited by Erasmus Gemini in 1558. The first separate publication appeared in Milan a year later. \nThe Vatican manuscript (formerly Parraciani Ricci), in Latin with autograph corrections, was edited and published by Gennaro Barbarisi in 1990. The manuscript contains neither the title nor the division into chapters. Many variants in the first edition are attributed to Erasmus Gemini. \n\nThe Spanish Galateo of Lucas Gracián Dantisco was very influential in the seventeenth century. In the Enlightenment, the letters of Lord Chesterfield show the influence of Galateo, as does a self-help manuscript of George Washington. The first American edition was published in Baltimore in 1811, with a short appendix on how to slice and serve meats.\n\n\n"}

He is known for his work in the fields of ethics, action theory, philosophy of law, and political philosophy as well as individual rights and the authority of the state. Feinberg was one of the most influential figures in American jurisprudence of the last fifty years.\n\nFeinberg studied at the University of Michigan, writing his dissertation on the philosophy of the Harvard professor Ralph Barton Perry under the supervision of Charles Stevenson. He taught at Brown University, Princeton University, UCLA and Rockefeller University, and, from 1977, at the University of Arizona, where he retired in 1994 as Regents Professor of Philosophy and Law.\n\nFeinberg was internationally distinguished for his research in moral, social and legal philosophy. His major four-volume work, \"The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\", was published between 1984 and 1988. Feinberg held many major fellowships during his career and lectured by invitation at universities around the world. He was an esteemed and highly successful teacher, and many of his students are now prominent scholars and professors at universities across the US. His former students include Jules Coleman, Russ Shafer-Landau, and Clark Wolf.\n\nFeinberg's most important contribution to legal philosophy is his four-volume book, \"The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\" (1984-1988), a work that is frequently characterized as \"magisterial.\" Feinberg's goal in the book is to answer the question: What sorts of conduct may the state rightly make criminal? John Stuart Mill, in his classic On Liberty (1859), had given a staunchly \"liberal\" answer to this question. According to Mill, the only kind of conduct that the state may rightly criminalize is conduct that causes harm to others. Though Feinberg, who had read and re-read Mill's classic text many times, shares Mill's liberal leanings, he thinks that liberals can and should admit that certain kinds of non-harmful but profoundly offensive conduct can also properly be prohibited by law. In \"The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\", Feinberg seeks to develop and defend a broadly Millian view of the limits of state power over the individual. In the process, he defends what many would view as characteristically \"liberal\" positions on topics such as suicide, obscenity, pornography, hate speech, and euthanasia. He also analyzes with great subtlety and skill concepts such as \"harm,\" \"offense,\" \"wrong,\" \"autonomy,\" \"responsibility,\" \"paternalism,\" \"coercion,\" and \"exploitation.\" In a surprising twist, Feinberg concedes in the conclusion to the final volume that liberalism may not be fully defensible. Liberals, he claims, may have to concede that in rare cases it may be legitimate for the government to criminalize certain kinds of moral harms and harmless immoralities.\n\nIn \"Offense to Others\", the second volume of \"The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\", Feinberg offers one of the most famous thought-experiments in recent philosophy: a series of imaginary scenarios he calls \"a ride on the bus.\" Feinberg invites us to imagine a bus ride in which you, a passenger rushing to an important appointment, are confronted by a series of deeply offensive but harmless acts. Some of the acts involve affronts to the senses (e.g., a man scratching his fingernails across a slate). Others involve acts that are deeply disgusting or revolting (e.g., eating various kinds of nauseatingly repulsive things). Still others involve affronts to our religious, moral, or patriotic sensibilities (e.g., overt acts of flag desecration); shocks to our sense of shame or embarrassment (such as acts of public sex); and a wide range of offensive conduct based on fear, anger, humiliation, boredom or frustration. The thought experiment is designed to test the limits of our tolerance for harmless but deeply offensive forms of behavior. More precisely, it raises the question \"whether there are any human experiences that are harmless in themselves yet so unpleasant that we can rightly demand legal protection from them even at the cost of other persons' liberties.\" Feinberg argues that even left-leaning, highly tolerant liberals must recognize that some forms of harmless but profoundly offensive conduct can properly be criminalized.\n\nIn a paper prepared in 1958 for the benefit of students at Brown, Feinberg seeks to refute the philosophical theory of psychological egoism, which in his opinion is fallacious. So far as he can tell, there are four primary arguments for it:\n\n\nFeinberg observes that such arguments for psychological egoism are rarely mounted on the basis of empirical proof when, being psychological, they very well ought to. The opening argument he dubs a tautology from which \"nothing whatever concerning the nature of my motives or the objective of my desires can possibly follow [...]. It is not the genesis of an action or the \"origin\" of its motives which makes it a 'selfish' one, but rather the 'purpose' of the act or the \"objective\" of its motives; \"not where the motive comes from\" (in voluntary actions it always comes from the agent) but \"what it aims at\" determines whether or not it is selfish.\"\n\nSimilarly flawed in Feinberg's opinion is the second argument. Just because all successful endeavour engenders pleasure does not necessarily entail that pleasure is the sole objective of all endeavour. He uses William James's analogy to illustrate this fallacy: although an ocean liner always consumes coal on its trans-Atlantic voyages, it is unlikely that the sole purpose of these voyages is coal consumption.\n\nThe third argument, unlike the first two, contains no \"non sequitur\" that Feinberg can see. He nevertheless adjudges that such a sweeping generalisation is unlikely to be true.\n\nIn the final argument, Feinberg sees a paradox. The only way to achieve happiness, he believes, is to forget about it, but psychological egoists hold that all human endeavour, even that which achieves happiness, is geared towards happiness. Feinberg poses a thought experiment in which a character named Jones is apathetic about all but the pursuit of his own happiness. Because he has no means to achieve that end, however, \"[i]t takes little imagination [...] to see that Jones's one desire is bound to be frustrated.\" To pursue only happiness, then, is to fail utterly to achieve it.\n\n\n\n\n"}

(c. 1595 – c. 1650), was a member of the aristocracy in Ireland who became a Franciscan friar. He served as a teacher and lecturer both locally and on the Continent. He was the Minister Provincial of Ireland during the Irish Confederate Wars, due to which position he communicated on Irish affairs with Franciscans on the European mainland, such as the historian, Friar Luke Wadding. He became involved in the conflict, opposing the excommunications issued by the papal nuncio in 1648. He last appears in documents dated July 1649.\n\nBarnewall was the son of Robert Barnewall, 7th Baron Trimlestown (died 1639), and a brother of Matthias Barnewall, 8th Baron Trimlestown (died 1667). His mother was Genet Talbot, daughter of Thomas Talbot of Dardistown Castle, County Meath. The family was a significant member of the Old English gentry in The Pale of County Meath, having come over from England with King Henry II. One ancestor, John Barnewall, 3rd Baron Trimlestown (died 1538), was Lord Chancellor of Ireland.\n\nJohn Barnewall went to the Continent and entered the Franciscan Order, going on to receive minor orders and then the subdiaconate at Mechelin, in the then-Spanish Netherlands, in December 1617. No documentation survives, but presumably he received further Holy Orders during the following months. He defended his theses in Scotist theology at Louvain in 1620, and again in 1627. He is believed to have taught as a lecturer in Germany in 1637, as well as subsequently at Prague, and at Slane in County Meath upon his return to Ireland. Among his students was the historian, Friar Peter Walsh. A contemporary stated that Barnewall taught philosophy and theology at Louvain for eight years prior to his election as Minister Provincial of Ireland at Quin, County Clare, on 15 August 1638. \n\nA letter he wrote to Wadding, dated 1 November 1642, confirms that he was still Minister Provincial at that date. In 1648 he opposed the excommunications issued by papal nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, of the members of the Supreme Council of the Confederation of Kilkenny. In July 1649 he was at Kilkenny, where he joined by the Franciscan guardians of his province in their condemnation of Friar Redmond Caron, who had been appointed Visitor to Ireland by Friar Pierre Marchant, who was a Definitor General of the Order, at the suggestion of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. There are no further known documentary references to Barnewall after this date.\n\n\n"}

Ehrman, a New Testament scholar at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The book introduces lay readers to the field of textual criticism of the Bible. Ehrman discusses a number of textual variants that resulted from intentional or accidental manuscript changes during the scriptorium era. The book made it to \"The New York Times\" Best Seller List.\n\nEhrman recounts his personal experience with the study of the Bible and textual criticism. He summarizes the history of textual criticism, from the works of Desiderius Erasmus to the present. The book describes an early Christian environment in which the books that would later compose the New Testament were copied by hand, mostly by Christian amateurs. Ehrman concludes that various early scribes altered the New Testament texts in order to de-emphasize the role of women in the early church, to unify and harmonize the different portrayals of Jesus in the four gospels, and to oppose certain heresies (such as Adoptionism).\n\nAlex Beam of the \"Boston Globe\", wrote that the book is \"a series of dramatic revelations for the ignorant\", and that \"Ehrman notes that there have been a lot of changes to the Bible in the past 2,000 years. I don't want to come between Mr. Ehrman and his payday, but this point has been made much more eloquently by... others.\"\n\nJeffrey Weiss of \"The Dallas Morning News\" wrote, \"Whichever side you sit on regarding Biblical inerrancy, this is a rewarding read.\" The American Library Association wrote, \"To assess how ignorant or theologically manipulative scribes may have changed the biblical text, modern scholars have developed procedures for comparing diverging texts. And in language accessible to nonspecialists, Ehrman explains these procedures and their results. He further explains why textual criticism has frequently sparked intense controversy, especially among scripture-alone Protestants.\" \n\nCharles Seymour of the Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas wrote, \"Ehrman convincingly argues that even some generally received passages are late additions, which is particularly interesting in the case of those verses with import for doctrinal issues such as women's ordination or the Atonement.\" \n\nNeely Tucker of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the book is \"an exploration into how the 27 books of the New Testament came to be cobbled together, a history rich with ecclesiastical politics, incompetent scribes and the difficulties of rendering oral traditions into a written text.\"\n\nCraig Blomberg, of Denver Seminary in Colorado, wrote that \"Most of \"Misquoting Jesus\" is actually a very readable, accurate distillation of many of the most important facts about the nature and history of textual criticism, presented in a lively and interesting narrative that will keep scholarly and lay interest alike.\" Blomberg also wrote that Ehrman \"has rejected his evangelicalism and whether he is writing on the history of the transmission of the biblical text, focusing on all the changes that scribes made over the centuries, or on the so-called 'lost gospels' and 'lost Christianities,' trying to rehabilitate our appreciation for Gnosticism, it is clear that he has an axe to grind.\"\n\nIn 2007, Timothy Paul Jones wrote a book-length response to \"Misquoting Jesus\", called \"Misquoting Truth: A Guide to the Fallacies of Bart Ehrman's \"Misquoting Jesus\"\".

Neigong practice is normally associated with the so-called \"soft style\", \"internal\" or neijia 內家 Chinese martial arts, as opposed to the category known as waigong 外功 or \"external skill\" which is historically associated with shaolinquan or the so-called \"hard style\", \"external\" or wàijiā 外家 Chinese martial arts. Both have many different schools, disciplines and practices and historically there has been mutual influence between the two and distinguishing precisely between them differs from school to school. \n\nThere is both martial and non-martial neigong. Well known examples of martial neigong are the various breathing and focus trainings taught in some traditional Taijiquan, Baguazhang and Xingyiquan schools. An example of non-martial neigong is the discipline known as Daoyin.\n\nThe martial art school of neigong emphasises training the coordination of the individual's body with the breath, known as the harmonisation of the inner and outer energy(內外合一), creating a basis for a particular school's method of utilising power and technique. \n\nNeigong exercises that are part of the neijia tradition involve cultivating physical stillness and or conscious (deliberate) movement, designed to produce relaxation or releasing of muscular tension combined with special breathing techniques such as the \"tortoise\" or \"reverse\" methods. The fundamental purpose of this process is to develop a high level of coordination, concentration and technical skill that is known in the martial arts world as neijin (內勁). The ultimate purpose of this practice is for the individual to become at one with heaven or the Dao (天人合一). As Zhuangzi stated, \"Heaven, earth and I are born of one, and I am at one with all that exists (天地與我並生, 萬物與我唯一)\".\n\nMartial Nei Gung is about developing internal power. One way to possibly achieve this is to train particular exercises regularly where the breath is matched with movements of blood or to effect the movement of blood throughout the body. Through these exercises it can be possible to move the blood to a particular area during a particular movement to have a particular result. One of the benefits of martial nei gung exercises is the relaxation of blood vessels, nerves, muscles and sinews to help the body move more freely. With the body moving freely and an excess of blood moving to a particular area with little or no effort, the practitioner can possibly develop many benefits. These benefits may include:\n\nIt is important to understand that anyone looking to learn Nei Gung sincerely, is more likely to learn it from a good teacher of internal martial arts like Hsing-Yi (one of the easiest and most powerful forms of martial cultivation). It is rare to learn authentic Daoist practices from a true master of the subject as quite a lot of the Nei Gung skills are an essential part of a complete system of martial arts. Nei Gung is not a philosophy, but a technique and an art of inner cultivation. There are intellectual guidelines to the practice of Nei Gung, but it is 'Inner Work' which means effort has to be put in to develop real, substantial and testable skills. This is not something that can be imagined or talked about, only from direct experience and hard effort can an understanding of Nei Gung develop. A true practitioner and teacher will take you on a journey growing your inner-world and showing you how to demonstrate the skills you are developing.\n\nThis type of practice is said to require concentration and internal reflection which results in a heightened self-awareness that increases over time with continued practice. Neigong practitioners report awareness of the mechanics of their blood circulation, peristalsis, muscular movement, skeletal alignment, balance, etc. \n\nWhat is said to be occurring as the result of continual practice is a type of internal alchemy, that is a refinement and transmutation of the \"Three Treasures\" or \"San Bao\" (三寳), in Chinese. The Three Treasures are known as Jing (精), Qi (氣) and Shen (神) and can be loosely translated as Essence, Vitality and Spirit. \n\nAccording to Daoist doctrine the Three Treasures can be described as three types of energy available to humans. The Dao De Jing purported to be written by Lao zi states in chapter 42 that \"The Dao (道) gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two (Taiji (太極) or Yin and Yang (陰陽)) and the Two gives birth to the Three (which some interpret to mean Jing 精, Qi 氣 and Shen 神, or sometimes Heaven Tian 天, Earth Di 地 and Man Ren 人) and lastly the Three gives birth to the 10,000 Things (Wanwu 萬物); which is all that exists in heaven and on earth.\n\nNeigong training follows therefore the classical Daoist developmental stages and regards the first two stages as a preparation for the last and final stage:\n<br>\"Physical body (Jing) -> Energy body (Qi) -> Divine Consciousness (Shen)\"\n\n\n\n"}

STICERD Distinguished Visiting Professor- BIOS Centre for the Study of Bioscience, Biomedicine, Biotechnology and Society, London School of Economics (2004)\n\nRabinow is known for his development of an \"anthropology of reason\". If anthropology is understood as being composed of anthropos + logos, then anthropology can be taken up as a practice of studying how the mutually productive relations of knowledge, thought, and care are given form within shifting relations of power. More recently, Rabinow has developed a distinctive approach to what he calls an \"anthropology of the contemporary\" that moves methodologically beyond modernity as an object of study or as a metric to order all inquiries.\n\nRabinow is well known for conceptual work drawing on French, German and American traditions. He was a close interlocutor of Michel Foucault, and has edited and interpreted Foucault’s work as well as ramifying it in new directions.\n\nRabinow’s work has consistently confronted the challenge of inventing and practicing new forms of inquiry, writing, and ethics for the human sciences. He argues that currently the dominant knowledge production practices, institutions, and venues for understanding things human in the 21st century are inadequate institutionally and epistemologically. In response, he has designed modes of experimentation and collaboration consisting in focused concept work and the explorations of new forms of case-based inquiry.\n\nRabinow has also devoted a great deal of energy to the invention of new venues, adjacent to the existing university structures, diagnosing the university’s disciplinary organization and career patterns as among the major impediment to 21st century thought. In view of the fact that the organization and practices of the social sciences and humanities in the U.S. university system have changed little in recent decades, they are unlikely to facilitate the composition of contemporary equipment. Rabinow has called for the creation of venues that are adjacent to, but more flexible than, the university and the existing disciplinary structure. He has played leading roles in the design of two such organizations, the Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory (ARC), and the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC).\n\nThe Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory was founded by Paul Rabinow, Stephen Collier, and Andrew Lakoff as part of an effort to create new forms of inquiry in the human sciences. Its aspiration is to create models for new infrastructures, tools of collaboration, and practices of inquiry. The core of the ARC collaboratory is ongoing reflection and communication in a now broadening network of scholars about concept formation and collaboratory work in the human sciences. ARC is a collaboratory for inquiry into contemporary forms of life, labor, and language. ARC engages in empirical study and conceptual work with global reach and long-term perspective. ARC creates contemporary equipment for collaborative work adequate to emergent challenges in the 21st century. ARC’s current concerns focus on interconnections among security, ethics, and the sciences.\n\nThe relation of concepts and cases in Rabinow’s work distinguishes itself from the more common mode of social science work predicated on using examples to test general theories or philosophical practice that seeks analytic clarity about universals or general (often highly abstract) cases. In contrast, Rabinow argues that work on concepts opens up and orients inquiry into the concrete features of distinctive cases, whereas the use of ostensibly timeless theory or universal concepts are unlikely to be very helpful in drawing attention to particularities and singularities. Given this goal, such traditional approaches can function as a real impediment to inquiry. Rabinow defines concept work as “constructing, elaborating and testing a conceptual inventory as well as specifying and experimenting with multi-dimensional diagnostic and analytic frames.” In that sense, Rabinow’s work continues with appropriate modifications a social scientific tradition stretching from Max Weber through Clifford Geertz.\n\nRabinow holds that concepts are tools designed to be used on specified problems and calibrated to the production of pragmatic outcomes both analytic and ethical. As such, concepts must be adjusted to the changing topology of problem spaces. Concept work involves archaeological, genealogical, and diagnostic dimensions. Archaeologically, concept work involves investigating and characterizing concepts as part of a prior repertoire or structured conceptual ensemble. Genealogically, concept work frees concepts from their field of emergence by showing the contingent history of their selection, formation, as well as their potential contemporary significance. Diagnostically, concept work involves a critical function: testing the adequacy and appropriateness of a given concept or repertoire of concepts to new problems and purposes.\n\nAs a mode of inquiry Rabinow distinguishes the Anthropology of the Contemporary from Michel Foucault’s History of the Present. As Rabinow describes it, the History of the Present consists in formulating an understanding of the past as “a means of showing the contingency of the present and thereby contribute to making a more open future.” The current challenge is to be specific about which inquiries and what objects are best engaged with an approach that is drawn from a History of the Present orientation.\nContrastingly, Rabinow defines the contemporary as a (re)assemblage of both old and new elements and their interactions and interfaces. This means, among other things, that contemporary problems and objects are emergent and consequently, by definition, contingent. Emergence refers to “a state in which multiple elements combine to produce an assemblage, whose significance cannot be reduced to prior elements and relations.” It follows that the History of the Present, while often helpful, is not fully adequate to work on the contemporary because by definition the contemporary is contingent.\n\nRabinow identifies “the contemporary” as a temporal and ontological problem space. In \"Marking Time\" (2007) he distinguishes two senses of the term contemporary. First, to be contemporary is to exist at the same time as something else. This meaning has temporal but no historical connotations. The second sense, however, carries both temporal and historical connotations, and it is this meaning that figures in Rabinow’s work. Rabinow takes up the contemporary as a “moving ratio.” Just as “the modern” can be thought of as a moving ratio of tradition and modernity, so the contemporary “is a moving ratio of modernity, moving through the recent past and near future in a (non-linear) space.”\n\nAs such, the Anthropology of the Contemporary consists of analytic work that helps develop modes of inquiry into under-determined, emergent and discordant relations. It seeks to develop methods, practices, and forms of inquiry and narration coherent and co-operable with understandings of the mode (or modes) taken by anthropos as figure and an assemblage today.\n\nInquiry into the contemporary is both analytic and synthetic. It is analytic in that sets of relations must be decomposed and specified, synthetic in that these relations must be recomposed and given new form. In this sense, work on the contemporary falls within a zone of analytic consideration in that it consists of linking the recent past to the near future and the near future to the recent past.\n\nRabinow’s work on the anthropology of the contemporary was formally initiated by his diagnosis of anthropos (Greek, “the human thing”) as a problem today for thought, equipment, and venues. This diagnosis is carried out most systematically in his works \"Anthropos Today\" (2003) and \"Marking Time\" (2007). Rabinow describes anthropos as a being which today is burdened with a multiple and heterogeneous truths about itself, a being of hetero-logoi. Modes of inquiry, methods of narration, and principles of verification must be designed in view of the “apparently unavoidable fact that anthropos is that being who suffers from too many logoi.”\n\nIt follows that in order to pose and eventually to answer the question “what is anthropos today?” modes of thought are needed which not only open up new possibilities, but also discriminate significance, and forms truth claims into practices for the ethical life. Using a classical formulation, Rabinow argues that anthropos today is in need of paraskeue or equipment for forming logos into ethos. In his 1981-82 lectures at the Collège de France Michel Foucault provided an extensive meditation on the classical notion of equipment. In those lectures Foucault shows that in antique thought the mandate to “know thyself” was connected and oriented to an imperative to “care for thyself.” Ramifying Foucault’s insight in new directions, Rabinow has posed the challenge of inventing equipment adequate to ethical and scientific problems today—contemporary equipment.\n\nIf the challenge of contemporary equipment is to develop a mode of thinking as ethical practice, it also involves the design or redesign of venues within which such formation is possible. Rabinow deals directly with the problem of venues in the work \"Synthetic Anthropos\" (with Gaymon Bennett) (2009). In that work Rabinow and Bennett argue that the question of where and how the composition of equipment takes place is itself a primary problem site.\n\nA defining feature of the venues Rabinow has called for and worked on is collaboration. Understood as a mode of work, Rabinow defines collaboration in distinction to cooperation. A cooperative mode of work consists in “demarcated tasking on distinct problems and objects, with occasional if regular exchange.” Cooperation does not entail either a common definition of problems or shared techniques of remediation. A collaborative mode of work, by contrast, proceeds from an interdependent division of labor on shared problems. It entails a common definition of problems (or acceptance of a problem-space).\n\nRabinow calls for the invention of new modes of collaboration where problem-spaces are unstable or emergent, and where prior problems and their significance can no longer be taken for granted and can fruitfully be contested. Such situations require the reworking of existing modes of reasoning and intervention, adjusting these modes to the topography of the emerging problem-space. It follows that collaboration is a mode of work appropriate to the anthropology of the contemporary\n\nCase work functions as an exercise in framing problems so as to identify potentially significant elements, relations, and interfaces. Case work underscores questions of how such material should be presented. Case work can indicate strengths and weaknesses in the venues in which inquiry is initiated and formed. Casework, therefore, is an essential aspect of inquiry neither reducible to theory nor an end-in-itself.\n\n(a) \"Constructing Equipment, Can the Human and Life Science Collaborate? (SynBERC 2006–2011).\"\n\nRabinow was an investigator in the (Human) Practices Thrust of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center. http://synberc.org. With Gaymon Bennett, he had been part of a collaborative effort to re-think the relationship between ethics and science within this NSF funded Engineering Research Center. In SynBERC, the mandate from the NSF was to invent a collaborative mode of engagement such that the relationship between ethics and science might be reconceived and reworked.\n\n(b) \"Chronicling Emergent Organizations (Celera Diagnostics 2003).\"\n\nRabinow, working with Talia Dan-Cohen, then an undergraduate at Berkeley, took up the challenge of chronicling Celera Diagnostic’s efforts to turn the complete sequence of the human genome into tools for diagnosing molecular predispositions for pathological developments in health. The anthropological work was an experiment in thought and production, given a self-imposed one year time limit for both research and writing. It was an experiment in collaboration involving first and second order modes of observation. The product is Rabinow and Dan-Cohen’s A Machine to Make a Future: Biotech Chronicles.\n\n(c) \"New Venues: Problematizing Knowledge, Care and Ethics (Centre d'Études du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) 1994).\"\n\nThe fieldwork leading up to French DNA: Trouble in Purgatory focused on a multidimensional crisis revolving around a proposal for commercial collaboration between an American biotechnology start-up company and the French laboratory that led the genome sequencing effort in France, the CEPH. As opposed to his earlier book, French Modern, French DNA is not a history of the present but an initial case study in the anthropology of the contemporary. Rabinow accepted the challenge from the Center’s scientific director to be a 'philosophic observer.’ His task was to identify the formation of constellations of value judgments around new forms of scientific knowledge, and to make that process available for further debate and modification, not to adjudicate disputes. The text is in part a meditation on committed ‘disinterestedness:’ “a certain vocational integrity, an asceticism in Weber and Foucault's senses, a certain rigor and patience that could, lead us somewhere beyond what we already believe and know.” This work still emphasizes the observation in “participant-observation” and can be contrasted to latter work at SynBERC in which both poles are put into play.\n\n(d) \"New Venues of Knowledge and Commerce: The Rise of Biotech Start-up Companies, (Cetus Corporation 1980s).\"\n\nCetus Corporation (later, Roche Molecular Systems) figured as both a scientific and anthropological milieu within which to explore a set of a highly specific set of political, economic, scientific and legal vectors that generated a new industry as well as a major technological development, the polymerase chain reaction. Contrary to narratives of invention and discovery as the work of individual geniuses, Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology highlights the assembling and governing of scientific and technical prowess, sustained teamwork, management skills, legal input and material resources, all of which were necessary for this fundamental molecular biological tool to emerge, be stabilized, commercialized and to become rapidly a tool fundamental for all biological research.\n\n(e) \"The Invention of Modern Equipment: (France and its Colonies 1830-1930\").\n\nFrench Modern: Norms and Forms of the Social Environment is a fine-grained genealogical account on the rise of the French “social” moving conceptually through domains as diverse as nineteenth century epidemiology, sociology, the Beaux Arts, colonial administration, Lamarckian biology, statistics, etc. French Modern demonstrates the century long process of bringing these domains of knowledge and practices of power slowly into a common frame of rationality and eventually into an operative apparatus characteristic of the welfare state.\n\n(f)\" Philosophy as Inquiry: Fieldwork in Philosophy (Encountering Hubert Dreyfus, Robert Bellah and Michel Foucault, 1976-84).\"\n\nTrained at the University of Chicago in the history of philosophy under the tutelage of Richard McKeon, where McKeon emphasized the rhetorical and pragmatic functions of philosophy (Dewey), Rabinow renewed this activity and moved beyond the work of his advisor, Clifford Geertz. Encounters with Robert Bellah and Hubert Dreyfus at UC Berkeley in the context of a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship year (1976–77) led to a focus on interpretive social science and ethical practice on the one hand, and an education in Heidegger and the question of technology and modern philosophy on the other. The work with Dreyfus led to a fortuitous encounter with Michel Foucault in 1979, the development of an intense dialogic working relationship, and a joint book with Dreyfus, \"Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics\", as well as an anthology of Foucault’s works (in consultation with Foucault), \"The Foucault Reader\", published shortly before his death.\n\n(g) \"Anthropology as Inquiry: Inheriting the Modern(Morocco, Middle Atlas Mountains 1968-1970).\"\n\nThe importance of colonial history, the self-understanding of descendents of an Islamic saint, the dilemma of tradition and modernity as well as fieldwork itself, as a practice, rite and site of self-formation, became case material for reflection. The major themes that Rabinow will consistently pursue for the next decades are all incipiently present in these untimely reflections; ethics as form giving, motion and care.

{"id": "46002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46002", "title": "Pax Americana", "text": "Pax Americana\n\nPax Americana (Latin for \"American Peace\", modeled after \"Pax Romana\", \"Pax Britannica\", and \"Pax Mongolica\") is a term applied to the concept of relative peace in the Western Hemisphere and later the world beginning around the middle of the 20th century, thought to be caused by the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States. Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used with different meanings and eras, such as the post-Civil War era in North America, and regionally in the Americas at the start of the 20th century.\n\n\"Pax Americana\" is primarily used in its modern connotations to refer to the peace among great powers established after the end of World War II in 1945, also called the Long Peace. In this modern sense, it has come to indicate the military and economic position of the United States in relation to other nations. For example, the Marshall Plan, which spent $13 billion to rebuild the economy of Western Europe, has been seen as \"the launching of the pax americana\".\n\nThe Latin term derives from \"Pax Romana\" of the Roman Empire. The term is most notably associated with \"Pax Britannica\" (1815–1914) under the British Empire, which served as the global hegemon and constabulary from the late 18th century until the early 20th century.\n\nThe first articulation of a \"Pax Americana\" occurred after the end of the American Civil War with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the First World War. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of American exceptionalism. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among developed nations in terms of its national credo, historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from Alexis de Tocqueville, who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of immigrants and the first modern democracy. From the establishment of the United States after the American Revolution until the Spanish–American War, the foreign policy of the United States had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States' national prosperity. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the federal constitutional republic. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of \"Forum\": \"The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the \"pax Americana\".\"\n\nWith the rise of the New Imperialism in the Western hemisphere at the end of the 19th century, debates arose between imperialist and isolationist factions in the U.S. Here, \"Pax Americana\" was used to connote the peace across the United States and, more widely, as a Pan-American peace under the aegis of the Monroe Doctrine. Those who favored traditional policies of avoiding foreign entanglements included labor leader Samuel Gompers and steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. American politicians such as Henry Cabot Lodge, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt advocated an aggressive foreign policy, but the administration of President Grover Cleveland was unwilling to pursue such actions. On January 16, 1893, U.S. diplomatic and military personnel conspired with a small group of individuals to overthrow the constitutional government of the Kingdom of Hawaii and establish a Provisional Government and then a republic. On February 15, they presented a treaty for annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the U.S. Senate, but opposition to annexation stalled its passage. The United States finally opted to annex Hawaii by way of the Newlands Resolution in July 1898.\n\nAfter its victory in the Spanish–American War of 1898 and the subsequent acquisition of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, the United States had gained a colonial empire. By ejecting Spain from the Americas, the United States shifted its position to an uncontested regional power, and extended its influence into Southeast Asia and Oceania. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were relatively small, these colonies were strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly China. In the Caribbean area, the United States established a sphere of influence in line with the Monroe Doctrine, not explicitly defined as such, but recognized in effect by other governments and accepted by at least some of the republics in that area. The events around the start of the 20th century demonstrated that the United States undertook an obligation, usual in such cases, of imposing a \"Pax Americana\". As in similar instances elsewhere, this Pax Americana was not quite clearly marked in its geographical limit, nor was it guided by any theoretical consistency, but rather by the merits of the case and the test of immediate expediency in each instance. Thus, whereas the United States enforced a peace in much of the lands southward from the Nation and undertook measures to maintain internal tranquility in such areas, the United States on the other hand withdrew from interposition in Mexico.\n\nEuropean powers largely regarded these matters as the concern of the United States. Indeed, the nascent Pax Americana was, in essence, abetted by the policy of the United Kingdom, and the preponderance of global sea power which the British Empire enjoyed by virtue of the strength of the Royal Navy. Preserving the freedom of the seas and ensuring naval dominance had been the policy of the British since victory in the Napoleonic Wars. As it was not in the interests of the United Kingdom to permit any European power to interfere in Americas, the Monroe Doctrine was indirectly aided by the Royal Navy. British commercial interests in South America, which comprised a valuable component of the Informal Empire that accompanied Britain's imperial possessions, and the economic importance of the United States as a trading partner, ensured that intervention by Britain's rival European powers could not engage with the Americas.\n\nThe United States lost its Pacific and regionally bounded nature towards the end of the 19th century. The government adopted protectionism after the Spanish–American War and built up the navy, the \"Great White Fleet\", to expand the reach of U.S. power. When Theodore Roosevelt became President in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism towards foreign intervention which had begun under his predecessor, William McKinley. The Philippine–American War arose from the ongoing Philippine Revolution against imperialism. Interventionism found its formal articulation in the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming the right of the United States to intervene in the affairs of weak states in the Americas in order to stabilize them, a moment that underlined the emergent U.S. regional hegemony.\n\nThe United States had been criticized for not taking up the hegemonic mantle following the disintegration of \"Pax Britannica\" before the First World War and during the interwar period due to the absence of established political structures, such as the World Bank or United Nations which would be created after World War II, and various internal policies, such as protectionism. Though, the United States participated in the Great War, according to Woodrow Wilson:\n\n[...] to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.\n[...] for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\n\nThe United States' entry into the Great War marked the abandonment of the traditional American policy of isolation and independence of world politics. Not at the close of the Civil War, not as the result of the Spanish War, but in the Interwar period did the United States become a part of the international system. With this global reorganization from the Great War, there were those in the American populace that advocated an activist role in international politics and international affairs by the United States. Activities that were initiated did not fall into political-military traps and, instead, focused on economic-ideological approaches that would increase the American Empire and general worldwide stability. Following the prior path, a precursor to the United Nations and a league to enforce peace, the League of Nations, was proposed by Woodrow Wilson. This was rejected by the American Government in favor of more economic-ideological approaches and the United States did not join the League. Additionally, there were even proposals of extending the Monroe Doctrine to Great Britain put forth to prevent a second conflagration on the European theater. Ultimately, the United States' proposals and actions did not stop the factors of European nationalism spawned by the previous war, the repercussions of Germany's defeat, and the failures of the Treaty of Versailles from plunging the globe into a Second World War.\n\nBetween World War I and World War II, America also sought to continue to preserve \"Pax America\" as a corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Some sought the peaceful and orderly evolution of existing conditions in the western hemisphere and nothing by immediate changes. Before 1917, the position of the United States government and the feelings of the nation in respect to the \"Great War\" initially had properly been one of neutrality. Its interests remained untouched, and nothing occurred of a nature to affect those interests.\n\nThe average American's sympathies, on the other hand, if the feelings of the vast majority of the nation had been correctly interpreted, was with the Allied (Entente) Powers. The population of the United States was revolted at the ruthlessness of the Prussian doctrine of war, and German designs to shift the burden of aggression encountered skeptical derision. The American populace saw themselves safeguarding liberal peace in the Western World. To this end, the American writer Roland Hugins stated:\n\nThe truth is that the United States is the only high-minded Power left in the world. It is the only strong nation that has not entered on a career of imperial conquest, and does not want to enter on it. [...] There is in America little of that spirit of selfish aggression which lies at the heart of militarism. Here alone exists a broad basis for \"a new passionate sense of brotherhood, and a new scale of human values.\" We have a deep abhorrence of war for war's sake; we are not enamored of glamour or glory. We have a strong faith in the principle of self-government. We do not care to dominate alien peoples, white or colored; we do not aspire to be the Romans of tomorrow or the \"masters of the world.\" The idealism of Americans centers in the future of America, wherein we hope to work out those principles of liberty and democracy to which we are committed This political idealism, this strain of pacifism, this abstinence from aggression and desire to be left alone to work out our own destiny, has been manifest from the birth of the republic. We have not always followed our light, but we have never been utterly faithless to it.\nIt was observed during this time that the initial defeat of Germany opened a moral recasting of the world. The battles between Germans and Allies were seen as far less battles between different nations than they represent the contrast between Liberalism and reaction, between the aspirations of democracy and the Wilhelminism gospel of iron.\n\nThe modern \"Pax Americana\" era is cited by both supporters and critics of U.S. foreign policy after World War II. However, from 1946 to 1992 \"Pax americana\" is considered a partial international order, as it applied only to capitalist bloc countries, being preferable for some authors to speak about a \"Pax americana et sovietica\". Many commentators and critics focus on American policies from 1992 to the present, and as such, it carries different connotations depending on the context. For example, it appears three times in the 90 page document, \"Rebuilding America's Defenses,\" by the Project for the New American Century, but is also used by critics to characterize American dominance and hyperpower as imperialist in function and basis. From about the mid-1940s until 1991, U.S. foreign policy was dominated by the Cold War, and characterized by its significant international military presence and greater diplomatic involvement. Seeking an alternative to the isolationist policies pursued after World War I, the United States defined a new policy called containment to oppose the spread of communism.\n\nThe modern \"Pax Americana\" may be seen as similar to the period of peace in Rome, \"Pax Romana\". In both situations, the period of peace was 'relative peace'. During both \"Pax Romana\" and \"Pax Americana\" wars continued to occur, but it was still a prosperous time for both Western and Roman civilizations. It is important to note that during these periods, and most other times of relative tranquility, the peace that is referred to does not mean complete peace. Rather, it simply means that the civilization prospered in their military, agriculture, trade, and manufacturing.\n\nFrom the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 until World War I in 1914, the United Kingdom played the role of offshore-balancer in Europe, where the balance of power was the main aim. It was also in this time that the British Empire became the largest empire of all time. The global superiority of British military and commerce was guaranteed by dominance of a Europe lacking in strong nation-states, and the presence of the Royal Navy on all of the world's oceans and seas. In 1905, the Royal Navy was superior to any two navies combined in the world. It provided services such as suppression of piracy and slavery. In this era of peace, though, there were several wars between the major powers: the Crimean War, the Franco-Austrian War, the Austro-Prussian War, the Franco-Prussian War, and the Russo-Japanese War, as well as numerous other wars. \"La Belle Époque\", William Wohlforth argued, was rather \"Pax Britannica\", \"Russica\" and later \"Germanica\", and between 1853 and 1871 it was not \"Pax\" of any kind.\n\nDuring the British hegemony, America developed close ties with Britain, evolving into what has become known as a \"special relationship\" between the two. The many commonalities shared with the two nations (such as language and history) drew them together as allies. Under the managed transition of the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations, members of the British government, such as Harold Macmillan, liked to think of Britain's relationship with America as similar to that of a progenitor Greece to America's Rome. Throughout the years, both have been active in North American, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries.\n\nAfter the Second World War, no armed conflict emerged among major Western nations themselves, and no nuclear weapons were used in open conflict. The United Nations was also soon developed after World War II to help keep peaceful relations between nations and establishing the veto power for the permanent members of the UN Security Council, which included the United States.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and US superpowers were engaged in the Cold War, which can be seen as a struggle between hegemonies for global dominance. After 1945, the United States enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the rest of the industrialized world. In the Post–World War II economic expansion, the US was responsible for half of global industrial output, held 80 percent of the world's gold reserves, and was the world's sole nuclear power. The catastrophic destruction of life, infrastructure, and capital during the Second World War had exhausted the imperialism of the Old World, victor and vanquished alike. The largest economy in the world at the time, the United States recognized that it had come out of the war with its domestic infrastructure virtually unscathed and its military forces at unprecedented strength. Military officials recognized the fact that Pax Americana had been reliant on the effective United States air power, just as the instrument of Pax Britannica a century earlier was its sea power. In addition, a \"unipolar moment\" was seen to have occurred following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe term \"Pax Americana\" was explicitly used by John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, who advocated against the idea, arguing that the Soviet bloc was composed of human beings with the same individual goals as Americans and that such a peace based on \"American weapons of war\" was undesirable:\n\nI have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a \"Pax Americana\" enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.\n\nBeginning around the Vietnam War, the 'Pax Americana' term had started to be used by the critics of American Imperialism. Here in the late 20th century conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, the charge of \"Neocolonialism\" was often aimed at Western involvement in the affairs of the Third World and other developing nations. NATO became regarded as a symbol of \"Pax Americana\" in West Europe:\nCurrently, the \"Pax Americana\" is based on the military preponderance beyond challenge by any combination of powers and projection of power throughout the world's \"commons\"—neutral sea, air and space. This projection is coordinated by the Unified Command Plan which divides the world on regional branches controlled by a single command. Notably, \"the right to command\" translated into Latin renders \"imperium\". Integrated with it are global network of military alliances (the Rio Pact, NATO, ANZUS and bilateral alliances with Japan and several other states) coordinated by Washington in a hub-and-spokes system and worldwide network of several hundreds of military bases and installations. Neither the Rio Treaty, nor NATO, for Robert J. Art, \"was a regional collective security organization; rather both were regional imperia run and operated by the United States\". Former Security Advisor Zbignew Brzezinski drew an expressive summary of the military foundation of \"Pax Americana\" shortly after the \"unipolar moment\":\nBesides the military foundation, there are significant non-military international institutions backed by American financing and diplomacy (like the United Nations and WTO). The United States invested heavily in programs such as the Marshall Plan and in the reconstruction of Japan, economically cementing defense ties that owed increasingly to the establishment of the Iron Curtain/Eastern Bloc and the widening of the Cold War.\n\nBeing in the best position to take advantage of free trade, culturally indisposed to traditional empires, and alarmed by the rise of communism in China and the detonation of the first Soviet atom bomb, the historically non-interventionist U.S. also took a keen interest in developing multilateral institutions which would maintain a favorable world order among them. The International Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), part of the Bretton Woods system of international financial management was developed and, until the early 1970s, the existence of a fixed exchange rate to the US dollar. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was developed and consists of a protocol for normalization and reduction of trade tariffs.\n\nWith the fall of the Iron Curtain, the demise of the notion of a \"Pax Sovietica\", and the end of the Cold War, the U.S. maintained significant contingents of armed forces in Europe and East Asia. The institutions behind the Pax Americana and the rise of the United States unipolar power have persisted into the early 21st century. The ability of the United States to act as \"the world's policeman\" has been constrained by its own citizens' historic aversion to foreign wars. Though there has been calls for the continuation of military leadership, as stated in \"Rebuilding America's Defenses\":\n\nThe American peace has proven itself peaceful, stable, and durable. It has, over the past decade, provided the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth and the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy. Yet no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global \"Pax Americana\" will not preserve itself. [... What is required is] a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibilities.\nThis is reflected in the research of American exceptionalism, which shows that \"there is some indication for [being a leader of an 'American peace'] among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes\". It should be noted that resentments have arisen at a country's dependence on American military protection, due to disagreements with United States foreign policy or the presence of American military forces.\nIn the \"post-communism\" world of the 21st-century, the French Socialist politician and former Foreign Minister Hubert Védrine describes the US as a hegemonic hyperpower, while the U.S. political scientists John Mearsheimer and Joseph Nye counter that the US is not a \"true\" hegemony, because it does not have the resources to impose a proper, formal, global rule; despite its political and military strength, the US is economically equal to Europe, thus, cannot rule the international stage. Several other countries are either emerging or re-emerging as powers, such as China, Russia, India, and the European Union.\n\nJoseph Nye discredited the United States as not a \"true\" hegemony in his 2002 article titled \"The New Rome Meets the New Barbarians\". His book of the same year he opens: \"Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others.\" And his 1991 book he titled \"Bound to Lead\". \"Leadership\", translated into Greek, renders \"hegemony\"; an alternative translation is \"archia\" – Greek common word for \"empire\". Having defined the US hegemony as \"not true\", Nye looks for an analogy to the true empire: Decline, he writes, is not necessarily imminent. \"Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the peak of its power ...\n\nIn fact, there are striking parallels with the early \"Pax Romana\" (especially between 189 BC when the supremacy over the Mediterranean was won and the first annexation in 168 BC). Under that \"Pax Romana\" other states remained formally independent and very seldom were called \"clients\". The latter term became widely used only in the late medieval period. Usually, other states were called \"friends and allies\"—a popular expression under the \"Pax Americana\".\n\nOne of the first to use the term \"Pax Americana\" was the Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy. In 1942, the Committee envisaged that the United States may have to replace the British Empire. Therefore, the United States \"must cultivate a mental view toward world settlement after this war which will enable us to impose our own terms, amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana\". According to Swen Holdar, the founder of geopolitics Rudolf Kjellen (1864–1922) predicted the era of US global supremacy using the term \"Pax Americana\" shortly after World War I. Writing in 1945, Ludwig Dehio remembered that the Germans used the term \"Pax Anglosaxonica\" in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918:\n\nThe United States, Dehio associates on the same page, withdrew to isolation on that occasion. \"Rome, too, had taken a long time to understand the significance of her world role.\" Two years earlier, with the war still at its peak, the founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, invoked the example of the two-centuries long \"Pax Romana\" which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power:\n\nOne of the first criticisms of \"Pax Americana\" was written by Nathaniel Peffer in 1943:\n\nHowever, Peffer was not certain that this would not happen: \"It is conceivable that ... America might drift into empire, imperceptibly, stage by stage, in a kind of power-politics gravitation.\" He also noted that America was heading precisely in that direction: \"That there are certain stirrings in this direction is apparent, though how deep they go is unclear.\"\n\nThe depth soon became clarified. Two later critics of Pax Americana, Michio Kaku and David Axelrod, interpreted the outcome of Pax Americana: \"Gunboat diplomacy would be replaced by Atomic diplomacy. Pax Britannica would give way to Pax Americana.\" After the war, with the German and British militaries in tatters, only one force stood on the way to Pax Americana: the Red Army. Four years after this criticism was written, the Red Army withdrew, paving the way for the unipolar moment. Joshua Muravchik commemorated the event by titling his 1991 article, \"At Last, Pax Americana\". He detailed:\nThe following year, in 1992, a US strategic draft for the post-Cold War period was leaked to the press. The person responsible for the confusion, former Assistant Secretary of State, Paul Wolfowitz, confessed seven years later: \"In 1992 a draft memo prepared by my office at the Pentagon ... leaked to the press and sparked a major controversy.\" The draft's strategy aimed \"to prevent any hostile power from dominating\" a Eurasian region \"whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power\". He added: \"Senator Joseph Biden ridiculed the proposed strategy as 'literally a \"Pax Americana\" ... It won't work ...' Just seven years later, many of these same critics seem quite comfortable with the idea of a \"Pax Americana\".\"\n\nThe post-Cold War period, concluded William Wohlforth, much less ambiguously deserves to be called \"Pax Americana\". \"Calling the current period the true Pax Americana may offend some, but it reflects reality\".\n\nThe ‘’Pax Americana’’ motif reached its peak in the context of the 2003 Iraq War. The phrase \"American Empire\" appeared in one thousand news stories over a single six-month period in 2003. Jonathan Freedland observed:\n\"The New York Review of Books\" illustrated a recent piece on US might with a drawing of George Bush togged up as a Roman centurion, complete with shield and spears. Bush's visits to Germany in 2002 and 2006 resulted in further Bush-as-Roman-emperor invective appearing in the German press. In 2006, freelance writer, political satirist, and correspondent for the left-leaning \"Die Tageszeitung\", Arno Frank, compared the spectacle of the visit by \"Imperator\" Bush to \"elaborate inspection tours of Roman emperors in important but not completely pacified provinces—such as Germania\". In September 2002, Boston's WBUR-FM radio station titled a special on US imperial power with the tag \"Pax Americana\". \"The Roman parallel, wrote Niall Ferguson in 2005, is in danger of becoming something of a cliché.\" Policy analyst Vaclav Smil titled his 2010 book by what he intended to explain: \"Why America Is Not a New Rome\". The very phenomenon of the Roman-American association became the subject of research for Classicist Paul J. Burton.\n\nPeter Bender, in his 2003 article \"America: The New Roman Empire\", summarized: \"When politicians or professors are in need of a historical comparison in order to illustrate the United States' incredible might, they almost always think of the Roman Empire.\" The article abounds with analogies:\n\nIn 1998, American political author, Charles A. Kupchan, described the world order \"After Pax Americana\" and the next year \"The Life after Pax Americana\". In 2003, he announced \"The End of the American Era\". In 2012, however, he projected: \"America's military strength will remain as central to global stability in the years ahead as it has been in the past.\"\n\nThe Russian analyst Leonid Grinin argues that at present and in the nearest future Pax Americana will remain an effective tool of supporting the world order since the US concentrates too many leadership functions which no other country is able to take to the full extent. Thus, he warns that the destruction of Pax Americana will bring critical transformations of the World-system with unclear consequences \n\n\"American imperialism\" is a term referring to outcomes or ideological elements of United States foreign policy. Since the start of the cold war, the United States has economically and/or diplomatically supported friendly foreign governments, including many that overtly violated the civil and human rights of their own citizens and residents. American imperialism concepts were initially a product of capitalism critiques and, later, of theorists opposed to what they take to be aggressive United States policies and doctrines. Although there are various views of the imperialist nature of the United States, which describe many of the same policies and institutions as evidence of imperialism, explanations for imperialism vary widely. In spite of such literature, the historians Archibald Paton Thorton and Stuart Creighton Miller argue against the very coherence of the concept. Miller argues that the overuse and abuse of the term \"imperialism\" makes it nearly meaningless as an analytical concept.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58397336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58397336", "title": "Polanyi’s paradox", "text": "Polanyi’s paradox\n\nPolanyi’s paradox, named in honour of the British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi, is the theory that human knowledge of how the world functions and capability are, to a large extent, beyond our explicit understanding. The theory was articulated by Michael Polanyi in his book \"The Tacit Dimension\" in 1966, but it was economist David Autor that named it as Polanyi’s paradox in his 2014 research paper on “Polanyi’s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth”.\n\nSummarised in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’, Polanyi’s paradox is mainly to explain the cognitive phenomenon that there exist many tasks which we, human beings, understand intuitively how to perform but cannot verbalize the rules or procedures behind it. This \"self-ignorance\" is common to many human activities, from driving a car in traffic to face recognition. As Polanyi argues, humans are relying on their tacit knowledge, which is difficult to adequately express by verbal means, when engaging these tasks. Polanyi's paradox has been widely considered a major obstacle in the fields of AI and automation, since the absence of consciously accessible knowledge creates tremendous difficulty in programming.\n\nBritish-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi regularly studied the causes behind human ability to acquire knowledge that they cannot explain through logical deduction. In his work \"The Tacit Dimension\" (1966)\",\" Polanyi explored the 'tacit' dimension to human knowledge and developed the concept of \"tacit knowledge\", as opposed to the term \"explicit knowledge\".\n\nTacit knowledge can be defined as knowledge people learn from experiences and internalize unconsciously, which is therefore difficult to articulate and codify it in a tangible form. Explicit knowledge, the opposite of tacit knowledge, is knowledge that can be readily verbalized and formalized. Tacit knowledge is largely acquired through implicit learning, the process by which information is learned independently of the subjects' awareness. For example, native speakers tacitly acquire their language in early childhood without consciously studying specific grammar rules (explicit knowledge), but with extensive exposure to television and day-to-day communication. Besides, people can only limitedly transfer their tacit knowledge through close interactions (sharing experiences with one another or observing others' behaviors). A certain level of trust needs to be established between individuals to capture tacit knowledge.\n\nTacit knowledge comprises a range of conceptual and sensory information that is featured with strong personal subjectivity. It is implicitly reflected in human actions; as argued by Polanyi, \"tacit knowledge dwells in our awareness\". People's skills, experiences, insight, creativity and judgement all fall into this dimension. Tacit knowledge can also be described as \"know-how,\" distinguishing from \"know-that\" or \"facts.\" Before Polanyi, Gilbert Ryle published a paper in 1945 drawing the distinction between \"knowing-that (knowledge of proposition)\" and \"knowing-how.\" According to Ryle, this \"know-how\" knowledge is the instinctive and intrinsic knowledge ingrained in the individual's human capability.\n\nSince tacit knowledge cannot be stated in propositional or formal form, Polanyi concludes such inability in articulation in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’. Daily activities based on tacit knowledge include recognizing a face, driving a car, riding a bike, writing a persuasive paragraph, developing a hypothesis to explain a poorly understood phenomenon. Take facial recognition as an illustration: we can recognize our acquaintance's face out of a million others while we are not conscious about the knowledge of his face. It would be difficult for us to describe the precise arrangement of his eyes, nose and mouth, since we memorize the face unconsciously.\n\nAs a prelude to \"The Tacit Dimension\", in his book \"Personal Knowledge\" (1958), Polanyi claims that all knowing is personal, emphasizing the profound effects of personal feelings and commitments on the practice of science and knowledge. Arguing against the then dominant Empiricists view that minds and experiences are reducible to sense data and collections of rules, he advocates a post-positivist approach that recognizes human knowledge is often beyond their explicit expression. Any attempt to specify tacit knowing only leads to self-evident axioms that cannot tell us why we should accept them.\n\nPolanyi's observation has deep implications in the AI field since the paradox he identified that \"our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our explicit understanding\" accounts for many of the challenges for computerization and automation over the past five decades. Automation requires high levels of exactness to inform the computer what is supposed to be done while tacit knowledge cannot be conveyed in a propositional form. Therefore, machines cannot provide successful outcomes in many cases: they have explicit knowledge (raw data) but nevertheless, do not know how to use such knowledge to understand the task as whole. This discrepancy between human reasoning and AI learning algorithms makes it difficult to automate tasks that demand common sense, flexibility, adaptability and judgment — human intuitive knowledge.\n\nMIT economist David Autor is one of the leading sceptics who doubt the prospects for machine intelligence. Despite the exponential growth in computational resources and the relentless pace of automation since the 1990s, Autor argues, Polanyi's paradox impedes modern algorithms to replace human labor in a range of skilled jobs. The extent of machine substitution of human labor, therefore, has been overestimated by journalists and expert commentators. Although contemporary computer science strives for prevailing over Polanyi's paradox, the ever-changing, unstructured nature of some activities currently presents intimidating challenges for automation. Despite years of time and billions of investment spent on the development of self-driving cars and cleaning robots, these machine learning systems continue to struggle with their low adaptability and interpretability, from self-driving cars' inability to make an unexpected detour to cleaning robots' vulnerability to unmonitored pets or kids. Instead, to let self-driving cars function optimally, we have to change current road infrastructure significantly, minimizing the need for human capabilities in the whole driving process.\n\nThe increasing occupational polarisation in the past few decades —the growth of both high-paid, high-skill abstract jobs and lower-paid, low-skill manual jobs — has been a manifestation of Polanyi's paradox. According to Autor, there are two types of tasks proven stubbornly challenging for artificial intelligence (AI): abstract tasks that require problem-solving capabilities, intuition, creativity and persuasion on the one hand, and manual tasks demanding situational adaptability, visual recognition, language understanding, and in-person interactions on the other. Abstract tasks are characteristic of professional, managerial, and technical occupations, while service and laborer occupations involve many manual tasks (e.g. cleaning, lifting and throwing). These jobs tend to be complemented by machines rather than substituted.\n\nBy contrast, as the price of computing power declines, computers extensively substitute for routine tasks that can be codified into clear sets of instructions, resulting in a dramatical decline in employment of routine task-­intensive jobs. This polarization has resulted in a shrinking middle class across industrialized economies since many middle-income occupations in sales, office and administrative work and repetitive production work are task-­intensive. Moreover, the subsequent growth in income inequality and wealth disparity has recently emerged as a major socio-economic issue in developed countries.\n\nSome technological optimists argue that recent advances in machine learning have overcome Polanyi's paradox. Instead of relaying on programmer’s algorithms to instruct them in human knowledge, computer systems are now able to learn tacit rules from context, abundant data, and applied statistics on their own. Since machines can infer the tacit knowledge that human beings draw upon from examples without human assistance, they are no longer limited by those rules tacitly applied but not explicitly understood by humans.\n\nAlphaGo program built by the Google subsidiary DeepMind is a great example of how advances in AI have allowed mindless machines to perform tasks based on tacit knowledge outstandingly. In the 2016 tournament of the strategy game Go, DeepMind’s AlphaGo program successfully defeated one of the world’s top GO players, Lee Se-dol, four games to one. DeepMind team employed an approach known as deep learning to build human-type judgment into AI systems; therefore, they can figure out complex winning strategies by seeing vast examples of Go matches.\n\nOn the other hand, as Carr argues, the assumption that computers need to be able to reproduce tacit knowledge applied by humans to perform complicated tasks is essentially doubtable. When performing demanding tasks, it is not necessary for systems and machines to reflect the rules that human beings follow at all. The requirement is to replicate our outcomes for practical purposes, rather than our means.\n\nJerry Kaplan, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and AI expert, also illustrates this point in his book \"Humans Need Not Apply\" by discussing four resources and capabilities required to accomplish any given task: awareness, energy, reasoning and means. Humans' biological system (the brain-body complex) naturally integrates all these four properties, while in the electronic domain machines nowadays are given these abilities by accelerating developments in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems. For example, sensory data provided by a wide network of sensors enable AI to perceive various aspects of the environment and respond instantly in chaotic and complex real-world situations (awareness); orders and signals for actuating devices can be centralised and managed in server clusters or on the 'cloud' (reasoning). Kaplan's argument directly supports the proposition that Polanyi's paradox can no longer impede further levels of automation, whether in performing routine jobs or manual jobs. As Kaplan puts it, \"Automation is blind to the colour of your collar.\"\n\nOne example confirms Kaplan's argument is the introduction of Cloud AutoML, an automated system that could help every business design AI software, by Google Brain AI research group in 2017. The learning algorithms of AutoML automates the process of building machine-learning models that can take on a particular task, aiming to democratize AI to the largest possible community of developers and businesses. According to Google’s CEO, Cloud AutoML has taken over some of the work of programmers (which is, in the words of Autor, \"abstract task\") and thereby offered one solution to the shortage in machine-learning experts.\n\nMoravec’s paradox is very closed related to Polanyi's paradox, which claims that compared with sophisticated tasks demanding high-level reasoning, it is harder for computers to master low-level physical and cognitive skills that are natural and easy for humans to perform. Examples include natural language processing and dextrous physical movements (e.g. running over rough terrain).\n\nRobotics experts have, therefore, discovered that machines are difficult to master the skills of even the least-trained manual worker, since these jobs require perception and mobility (tacit knowledge). In the words of the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker from his book \"The Language Instinct,\" \"The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.\"\n\nCorresponding to David Autor's discussion on jobs polarization, Pinker maintains that the appearance of the new generation's intelligent machines would place stock analysts, petrochemical engineers and parole board members in danger of being replaced. Gardeners, receptionists, and cooks are, by contrast, currently secure.\n\nMoore's Law is the observation articulated by Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of transistors that could be fitted onto an integrated circuit doubles every two years. Moore's law has significantly contributed to the advancement of machine learning and AI. The larger and larger capacity of a chip allows for the advent of extremely small data-collecting devices, which could be placed on any intelligent machine. Innovations resulted from the exponentially growing power of computer chips include mobile apps, video games, spreadsheets, and accurate weather forecasts.\n\nMoore’s Law changes the way people are valued. As machines can do more and more tasks for free, people become correspondingly expensive. On the other hand, Moore's Law to some extents erases the line between an ordinary person and a skilled person.\n\nAlthough Moore’s prediction had been realized until around 2012, Intel announced in 2015 that the pace was slowing to a halt. Thomas Wenisch, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, thinks the stagnant development of chips with denser transistors would create a problem for areas like mobile devices, data centers, and self-driving cars on different timescales. Without Moore's Law as the feedstock of innovation in computing, technology companies have to work harder to achieve new development levels (e.g. to get a new breakthrough on Polanyi's paradox).\n"}

He studied at Victoria University College of the University of New Zealand (now Victoria University of Wellington), and then Princeton University, before taking positions successively at several Australian institutions, including the University of Sydney. From 1971 until his death in Bali, Indonesia, he was a fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University in Canberra. \n\nSylvan was married to the philosopher/environmentalist Val Routley (later, Val Plumwood), with whom he worked closely for twenty years before their separation in 1982. After his divorce from Plumwood, he married Louise Sylvan (née Mirlin) in 1983 and adopted the last name \"Sylvan\" (an English word meaning \"of the forest\") to reflect his love of the forest and commitment to environmentalism.\n\nSylvan was instrumental in the development and study of relevance logic. In 1972, Sylvan (in a paper co-authored with Plumwood) proposed a semantics for certain relevant logics that had been developed by American philosophers Nuel Belnap and Alan Ross Anderson. Together with Robert K. Meyer, Routley turned this into a semantics for a large number of logical systems.\nTheir work in logic work helped make ANU a center for the study of non-classical logic in general. Routley's work had particular influence for Graham Priest, a well-known proponent of non-classical logic; Sylvan and Priest edited a well-regarded volume on the topic. Priest in turn influenced Sylvan; they met in 1976 at the Australasian Association of Logic conference in Canberra at a time when Sylvan was doing novel work on dialetheism — the view that some contradictions are true. Not long after meeting Priest, then investigating a logic capable of handling such true contradictions, Sylvan also endorsed the view.\n\nSylvan's studies ranged over a variety of topics in logic and the philosophy of logic. He wrote important papers on free logic, general modal logic, and natural deduction systems. However, much of his most important work in logic was dedicated to relevant logic, for which he authored numerous papers (both technical and expository).\n\nFrom early in his career (and for many years after), Sylvan defended a sophisticated Meinong-inspired ontology (which he called \"noneism\"), first presented in his 1966 paper, \"Some Things Do Not Exist.\" After several more papers in the 1970s, the theory was given a book-length treatment in 1980, \"Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond\". The view—also defended in recent years by Priest—utilizes a modal theory including \"impossible worlds\" to deal with supposed objects, like the \"round square.\" Sylvan's formulation is logically consistent, and avoids certain paradoxes associated with Meinong's original ontology; although, like many Meinongian views, it faces criticism due to its presumed ontological implausibility.\n\nOutside of logic and metaphysics, Sylvan was a proponent of so-called deep environmental ethics in the study of environmental ethics (following shallow/deep distinction formulated by Arne Næss). In his important 1973 paper \"Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?\", he defended a then-unorthodox account of the intrinsic value of the non-human, natural world. For this he was sometimes considered a defender of deep ecology, but he was in fact very critical of much of the domain.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Sylvan published several other notable articles and books on environmental ethics and issues, and he co-authored the 1994 book \"The Greening of Ethics\" with David Bennett. From his work in environmental ethics, Sylvan took an interest in anarchism, contributing an often-cited entry on the subject to \"A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy\".\n\n"}

He graduated from City College of New York, Phi Beta Kappa, and then attended a Japanese language school in Colorado.\n\nHe served in the United States Navy during World War II, translating Japanese military documents from the Pacific, until he was discharged in 1946. Kadish earned his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1948; during that time he studied with professors Herb Wechsler and Walter Gellhorn, who were influential on his career and scholarship. After law school, he practiced privately in New York before entering legal academia in 1951 at the University of Utah Law School, where he taught for ten years. He then joined the University of Michigan in 1961, before he joined UC Berkeley's School of Law (then \"Boalt Hall School of Law\") in 1964, where he stayed until his retirement in 1999. He served as Boalt's Dean from 1975 to 1982, and continued to serve as emeritus faculty (the Alexander F. and May T.

In the best understanding of contemporary consensus scholarship, the plays to be included in the First Folio (1623) were gathered together or \"compiled\" by John Heminges and Henry Condell, two long-time colleagues of Shakespeare in the King's Men. The play manuscripts may have been proofread and prepared for printing by Edward Knight, the \"book-keeper\" or prompter of the company. The task of proofreading and correcting the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the compositors and printers in the print-shop, yielding the uneven and often defective text that is the First Folio.\n\nEven less is known about the creation of the Second (1632), Third (1663–64), and Fourth Folios (1685) than about the First; see Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare).\n\nIn the 18th century, however, interested individuals made the first concerted efforts to bring order to the tangle of textual difficulties that the Folios of the previous century presented. The list below gives the date of each edition of Shakespeare's plays, the editor, the format of the collection, and pertinent specific information.\n\n\nThe early 19th century saw the first Variorum editions of Shakespeare's works, editions that collated and synthesized the efforts of the editors of the previous century:\n\n\nThese massive editions laid the foundation for modern textual scholarship on Shakespeare's works, and by extension on works of literature in general.

It was followed by the New Cambridge edition in 1921, and all modern standard editions inherit primarily from this edition.\n\nAs for the personalities involved: some of these men were friends, like Steevens, Reed, and Malone; acquaintances called them the Shakespeare Gang. Others nourished spirits of competitiveness and resentment. Pope made Theobald the first hero of \"The Dunciad.\" Warburton belittled Rowe's \"Account of the Life\" of Shakespeare — but he reprinted it in his own edition, without change or improvement. Despite his friendship with Malone and Reed, Steevens was famous for his irascibility; in notes to his 1793 edition of Shakespeare, he concocted obscene interpretations of some passages and attributed those readings to people he didn't like.\n\nThe next major edition, the Cambridge Shakespeare (1863–66), moved away from the practice of a single editor following his own sometimes capricious instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by William George Clark and John Glover, and the subsequent eight volumes by Clark and William Aldis Wright. Clark and Wright also produced the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts; together, these became the standard for the remainder of the century.\n\nThe most radical edition in the twentieth century was the Oxford Shakespeare, prepared under the general editorship of Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor. It aims to present the texts as they were originally performed, which results in numerous controversial choices, including presenting multiple texts of \"King Lear\", a text of \"Hamlet\" in which the scenes presumably cut by Shakespeare are relegated to an appendix, and an emphasis on the collaborative nature of several of the plays.\n\n"}

Funtowicz (born 1946) is a philosopher of science active in the field of science and technology studies.\nHe created the NUSAP, notational system for characterising uncertainty and quality in quantitative expressions, and together with Jerome R. Ravetz he introduced the concept of post-normal science. He is presently professor at the University of Bergen (Norway) at the Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities (SVT).\n\nSilvio Funtowicz began his career teaching mathematics, logic and research methodology in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He left Argentina during the military dictatorship, and moved to England where, during the 1980s he was a Research Fellow at the University of Leeds. Until his retirement in 2011 he was a scientific officer at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC). Since February 2012 he has been Professor II at the Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities (SVT) at the University of Bergen, Norway.\n\nSilvio Funtowicz's work with Jerome R. Ravetz Uncertainty and quality in science for policy started a series of reflections on the quality of science used for policy, mostly in connection with environmental and technological risks and policy-related research, introducing NUSAP a notational system for the management and communication of uncertainty in science for policy. NUSAP’s applications to different settings were spearheaded in the Netherlands by Jeroen van der Sluijs et al. 2005.\nBased on this ground work the concept of post-normal science was introduced in a series of papers published in the early nineties.\n\nThe article ‘Science for the post-normal age’ is presently the most cited paper of the journal Futures. Another very important and inspiring paper is 'The worth of a songbird:ecological economics as a post-normal science' in Ecological Economics.\n\nToday post-normal science (PNS) is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values. For Peter Gluckman (2014), chief science advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, post normal science approaches are today appropriate for a host of problems including “eradication of exogenous pests […], offshore oil prospecting, legalization of recreational psychotropic drugs, water quality, family violence, obesity, teenage morbidity and suicide, the ageing population, the prioritization of early-childhood education, reduction of agricultural greenhouse gases, and balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability”.\n\nFor Carrozza PNS can be “framed in terms of a call for the ‘democratization of expertise’”, and as a “reaction against long-term trends of ‘scientization’ of politics—the tendency towards assigning to experts a critical role in policymaking while marginalizing laypeople”.\n\nFuntowicz’s most recent work – with Roger Strand - has touched upon the issue of agency at times of change, arguing that a risk centred vision based on prediction and control in front of global and emerging treats should be replaced by one based on commitment: “rather than believing that contemporary global challenges will be sufficiently met by being responsible under risk, we will ask how to stay committed in times of change.” \nTogether with Ângela Guimarães Pereira he curated a volume for Oxford University Press ‘Science for Policy: New Challenges, New Opportunities’, and another with Routledge on the End of the Cartesian Dream which represent an important collective effort gathering three generation of scholars active in the field of PNS, followed a year later by a multi-authors book by the same community on the reproducibility and quality control crisis of science. Together with Andrea Saltelli and others he developed the concept of sensitivity auditing, an extension of sensitivity analysis for statistical and mathematical models used as input to policy design and appraisal.\nHe has authored with Alice Benessia a series of works on innovations and technoscience. These are critical essays on what it means for a society to be ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’.\nWith Jerome R. Ravetz he recently contributed two original voices to the Encyclopaedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences (Oxford) on ‘Peer Review and Quality Control’ and on ‘New Forms of Science. Since the nineties he has worked with Bruna De Marchi and others on risk governance and public participation.\n\nIn the 1990s, Silvio Funtowicz collaborated with the late James J. Kay and other members of what some have called the \"Dirk Gently Gang\" (including Mario Giampietro and David Waltner-Toews) on the Ecosystem Approach. This work, linking complexity theory, thermodynamics, and post-normal science, explored implications of this \"new science\" for environmental management and human well-being. Another scholar Silvio Funtowicz cooperates with is Martin O’Connor. His most recent work focuses on the crisis in the quality control of science, its impact on science's social functions, and the possible flaring of old and new science wars.\n\n\n\n"}

Suing for peace is usually initiated by the losing party in an attempt to stave off an unconditional surrender and may sometimes be favorable to the winning nation, as prosecuting a war to a complete or unconditional surrender may be costly. In this case, then, the word \"sue\" is being used in its original, now-obsolete meaning of \"to make petition to or for\", rather than the usual meaning of \"to take legal action against\".\n\nPressing for peace may sometimes, however, be started by the winning faction as a means to end the war for several reasons, such as where additional conflict would not be in the perceived best interest of the winning party. In this case, demands might be made, or the two nations may agree to a \"white peace,\" or status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe First Sino-Japanese War (1 August 1894 – 17 April 1895) was fought between the Qing Empire of China and the Empire of Japan, primarily over influence of Korea. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the Chinese port of Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895.\n\nThe archives abound with attempts to halt World War I, but most attempts were unofficial and of no effect. On 2 December 1916, prior to his coronation later that month, Charles I of Austria took over the title of Supreme Commander of the army from Archduke Frederick. In 1917, he secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. The negotiations of the Sixtus Affair for a sued peace failed.\n\n"}

Curry is an American author and professor of philosophy at Texas A&M University.\n\nIn 2017, Curry became the first Black professor to ever be promoted to the rank of full professor in the philosophy department at Texas A&M University. In 2004, Curry received his masters at DePaul University and his doctorate in philosophy from Southern Illinois University in 2009. His dissertation, Cast Upon the Shadows: Essays toward the Culturalogic Turn in Critical Race Theory, explored the political philosophy of Derrick Bell using only Black authors and theorists. His dissertation remains the only known work to have done this in the discipline of philosophy. His main research areas include critical race theory, Black Male Studies, and Africana philosophy. According to various documents including a signed statement by other faculty in Texas A&M University's philosophy department, Curry was hired specifically to research Critical Race Theory and revolutionary violence and armed resistance. Curry's publications and podcasts routinely give credit to radical race scholars such as Derrick Bell, Richard Delgado, and Robert Guthrie for their intellectual influence and guidance. \n\nIn 2017, Curry was targeted by white supremacists and the alt-right related to previous statements he had made comparing revolutionary violence and armed self-defense in the United States in a podcast analyzing Jamie Foxx's lead character in Django. Curry received death threats after the comments he made in 2012 were misquoted on a conservative website Rod Dreher admitted in a subsequent interview with the Chronicle that he targeted Curry after a student at Texas A&M University said they were disturbed by his research and classes on American racism. Dreher then admitted that Curry's \"language choices and rate of speech\" offended him, whereupon he decided to write a series of blogs attacking the professor. Curry later blamed the situation on the alt-right's targeting of Black professors and other anti-racism scholars across the country. Several academic websites and news sources have vindicated Curry noting that his words and research had been deliberately taken out of context. Over the last year, Curry's name has appeared in multiple national publications as a symbol of academic freedom garnering support and drawing attention to the risks Black professors take on in their discussion of race and racism in American universities.\n\nCurry is the author of \"The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemmas of Black Manhood\" (2017). In academic circles, The Man-Not is regarded as controversial for its discussion of the rape of Black males during slavery by white men and women, its depiction of white feminism as the perfection of patriarchy and American imperialism, and the text's documenting of the rape and domestic abuse Black males suffer at the hands of Black men and women in their communities. However, The Man-Not has received multiple positive reviews in Masculinity Studies, Black Studies, and Gender Studies journals. In August 2018, the Before Columbus Foundation announced that The Man-Not would be awarded a 2018 American Book Award for its original contribution to American literature and thought. Curry's book argues for the creation of a new field of study looking at the experiences and historical development of racialized men and boys the world over. In 2018, Temple University Press made Curry editor of the Black Male Studies series which Curry has claimed is the first book series specifically dedicated to the study of Black men and boys and racialized males to ever be supported on a University Press. Curry's research emphasizes the rape of Black men and boys during slavery and Jim Crow by white men and women and argues that under racist patriarchal regimes racialized males are sexually vulnerable to rape, genital mutilation, and dismemberment. Unlike current theories of Black masculinity that utilize intersectional theory to discuss Black men as a privileged disadvantaged group, Curry argues that racialized males are sexually vulnerable to dominant group men and women in racist societies because they are Man-Nots. Curry utilizes Social Dominance Theory and Global South Masculinities research to create a paradigm of outgroup-alien male fungibility that examines the historical treatment and violence racialized men and boys endure throughout history. His work also documents the rape of Jewish men and boys in the Holocaust German SS and Kapos as evidence of this sexual dynamic towards racialized males throughout history. . Curry's research on the sexual vulnerability and disposibility of racialized men and boys has been recognized by multiple awards over the last several years. In 2017, Curry was awarded the Alain Locke Award by the Society of American Philosophy for his public intellectual research and commentaries on anti-Black racism, the death and dying of Black males, and the rape of Black men and boys in the United States. His publications and national profile earned him recognition as one of the Top 15 Emerging Scholars of Color in the United States by Diverse Magazine in 2018. \n"}

He later married the sister of Misao Fujimura. While still a student, he began writing literary criticism and was interested in the development of naturalism.\n\nFrom 1920, Abe worked as a professor at Hosei University; however, he toured Europe extensively and spent some time at Heidelberg University in 1924 where he studied Kantian philosophy. In 1926 he accepted a position at Keijō Imperial University in Seoul Korea, where he became interested in Korean culture and Korean literature. He travelled to China in 1929, visiting Jinan, Qufu and climbed Mount Tai, and noted the strong Japanese commercial presence throughout Shandong Province. He also visited Manchuria and noted the increasing Chinese presence in Harbin \nAbe returned to mainland Japan in 1940, returning to his alma mater, the Daiichi High School in Tokyo. However, Abe soon ran afoul of the military authorities with his outspoken criticism of the military’s plans to cut short school curriculums to increase the numbers of conscripts, and of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe’s efforts to create a single-party state.

He is sometimes identified by his pen name, Song-un. He was born to a family of the Im clan in Miryang, Gyeongsang Province. After the deaths of his mother in 1558 and his father in 1559, he became a monk at Jikjisa on Hwangaksan in Gimcheon.\n\nIn 1561, he passed the \"seon-gwa\", the specialized gwageo (civil service examinations) for Buddhist monks. He corresponded with various scholars of the time including Pak Saam, Heo Hagok, and Im Baekho. In 1575, he was recommended as head of the Seon order, but refused and instead traveled to Myohyangsan. There he was instructed by preceptor Hyujeong. He went on to pass three years at Bodeoksa on Mount Kumgang, and later traveled through Palgongsan, Cheongnyangsan, and Taebaeksan.\n\nWith the start of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) in 1592, Yujeong joined his teacher Hyujeong's righteous army of monks. After Hyujeong retired due to his age, Yujeong took over the leadership of the army. He led the army into battles at Pyongyang and Uiryeong County in 1592, set up mountain fortresses through Gyeongsang in 1594, and joined in battle again at Ulsan and Suncheon.\n\nIn 1604, after the end of the war, he traveled to Japan on Seonjo of Joseon's orders to forge a peace accord with Tokugawa Ieyasu, and returned with 3500 Koreans who had been taken prisoner. Yujeong's diplomatic missions established a resilient foundation for a series of major Joseon missions to Japan.\n\nAfter his death in 1610 on Haeinsa, Yujeong was enshrined in the Pyochung Seowon in Miryang and at Suchungsa in Nyongbyon. He continues to be remembered in modern times, with numerous statues and other memorials around Korea. He has been cited together with Hyujeong as an example of a \"patriotic-minded\" Buddhist by the North Korean Buddhist Federation. Yujeong's writings are preserved in the \"Samyeongjip\" () and \"Bunchungseo Nallok\" ().\n\n\n\n"}
