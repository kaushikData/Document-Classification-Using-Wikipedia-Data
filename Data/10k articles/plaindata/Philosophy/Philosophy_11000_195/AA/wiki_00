{"id": "311264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311264", "title": "American Humanist Association", "text": "American Humanist Association\n\nThe American Humanist Association (AHA) is a non-profit organization in the United States that advances secular humanism, a philosophy of life that, without theism or other supernatural beliefs, affirms the ability and responsibility of human beings to lead personal lives of ethical fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.\n\nThe American Humanist Association was founded in 1941 and currently provides legal assistance to defend the constitutional rights of secular and religious minorities, actively lobbies Congress on church-state separation and other issues, and maintains a grassroots network of 150 local affiliates and chapters that engage in social activism, philosophical discussion and community-building events. The AHA has several publications, including the bi-monthly magazine \"The Humanist\", a quarterly newsletter \"Free Mind\", a peer-reviewed semi-annual scholastic journal \"Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism\", and a daily online news site TheHumanist.com.\n\nIn 1927 an organization called the \"Humanist Fellowship\" began at a gathering in Chicago. In 1928 the Fellowship started publishing the \"New Humanist\" magazine. H.G. Creel was the first editor. The \"New Humanist\" was published from 1928 to 1936. By 1935 the Humanist Fellowship had become the \"Humanist Press Association\", the first national association of humanism in the United States.\n\nThe first \"Humanist Manifesto\" was issued by a conference held at the University of Chicago in 1933. Signatories included the philosopher John Dewey, but the majority were ministers (chiefly Unitarian) and theologians. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses reason, ethics, and social and economic justice.\n\nIn July 1939 a group of Quakers, inspired by the 1933 Humanist Manifesto, incorporated under the state laws of California the Humanist Society of Friends as a religious, educational, charitable nonprofit organization authorized to issue charters anywhere in the world and to train and ordain its own ministry. Upon ordination these ministers were then accorded the same rights and privileges granted by law to priests, ministers, and rabbis of traditional theistic religions.\n\nCurtis Reese was a leader in the 1941 reorganization and incorporation of the \"Humanist Press Association\" as the American Humanist Association. Along with its reorganization, the AHA began printing \"The Humanist\" magazine. The AHA was originally headquartered in Yellow Springs, Ohio, then San Francisco, California, and in 1978 Amherst, New York. Subsequently, the AHA moved to Washington, D.C..\n\nIn 1952 the AHA became a founding member of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. As an international coalition of Humanist organizations, the IHEU stands today as the only international umbrella group for Humanism.\n\nThe AHA was the first national membership organization to support abortion rights. Around the same time, the AHA joined hands with the American Ethical Union (AEU) to help establish the rights of nontheistic conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. This time also saw Humanists involved in the creation of the first nationwide memorial societies, giving people broader access to cheaper alternatives than the traditional burial. In the late 1960s the AHA also secured a religious tax exemption in support of its celebrant program, allowing Humanist celebrants to legally officiate at weddings, perform chaplaincy functions, and in other ways enjoy the same rights as traditional clergy.\n\nIn 1991 the AHA took control of the Humanist Society, a religious Humanist organization that now runs the celebrant program. Since 1991 the organization has worked as an adjunct to the American Humanist Association to certify qualified members to serve in this special capacity as ministers. The Humanist Society's ministry prepares Humanist Celebrants to lead ceremonial observances across the nation and worldwide. Celebrants provide millions of Americans an alternative to traditional religious weddings, memorial services, and other life cycle events. After this transfer, the AHA commenced the process of jettisoning its religious tax exemption and resumed its exclusively educational status. Today the AHA is recognized by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit, tax exempt, 501(c)(3), publicly supported educational organization.\n\nMembership numbers are disputed, but Djupe and Olson place it as \"definitely fewer than 50,000.\" The AHA has over 575,000 followers on Facebook and over 42,000 followers on Twitter.\n\nThe AHA is also the supervising organization for various Humanist affiliates and adjunct organizations.\n\nThe Black Humanist Alliance of the American Humanist Association was founded in 2016 as a pillar of its new \"Initiatives for Social Justice.\" Like the Feminist Humanist Alliance and the LGBT Humanist Alliance, the Black Humanist Alliance uses an intersectional approach to addressing issues facing the Black community. As its mission states, the BHA \"concern ourselves with confronting expressions of religious hegemony in public policy,\" but is \"also devoted to confronting social, economic, and political deprivations that disproportionately impact Black America due to centuries of culturally ingrained prejudices.\"\n\nThe Feminist Humanist Alliance (formerly the Feminist Caucus) of the American Humanist Association was established in 1977 as a coalition of both women and men within the AHA to work toward the advancement of women's rights and equality between the sexes in all aspects of society. Originally called the Women's Caucus, the new name was adopted in 1985 as more representative of all the members of the caucus and of the caucus' goals. Over the years, members of the Caucus have advocated for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and participated in various public demonstrations, including marches for women's and civil rights. In 1982, the Caucus established its annual Humanist Heroine Award, with the initial award being presented to Sonia Johnson. Other Humanist Heroines include Tish Sommers, Christine Craft, and Fran Hosken. In 2012 the Feminist Caucus declared it would be organizing around two principal efforts: \"Refocusing on passing the ERA\" and \"Promoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\"\n\nIn 2016, the Feminist Caucus, mirroring the Black Humanist Alliance and the LGBT Humanist Alliance, reorganized as the Feminist Humanist Alliance as a component of their larger \"Initiatives for Social Justice.\" As stated on its website, the \"refinement in vision\" emphasized \"FHA's more active partnership with outreach programs and social justice campaigns with distinctly inclusive feminist objectives.\" Its current goal is to provide a \"movement powered by and for women, transpeople, and genderqueer people to fight for social justice. We are united to create inclusive and diverse spaces for activists and allies on the local and national level.\"\n\nThe LGBTQ Humanist Alliance (formerly LGBT Humanist Council) of the American Humanist Association is committed to advancing equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and their families. The alliance \"seeks to cultivate safe and affirming communities, promote humanist values, and achieve full equality and social liberation of LGBTQ persons.\"\n\nParalleling the Black Humanist Alliance and the Feminist Humanist Alliance, the Council reformed in 2016 as the LGBTQ Humanist Alliance as a larger part of the AHA's \"Initiatives for Social Justice.\"\n\nIn 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and Foundation Beyond Belief (FBB) merged their respective charitable programs Humanist Charities (established in 2005) and Humanist Crisis Response (established in 2011). AHA's Executive Director Roy Speckhardt commented that, “This merger is a positive move that will grow the relief efforts of the humanist community. The end result will be more money directed to charitable activities, dispelling the false claim that nonbelievers don’t give to charity.”\n\nNow Foundation Beyond Belief's Disaster Recovery program, this effort serves as a focal point for the humanist response to major natural disasters and complex humanitarian crises all over the world. The program coordinates financial support as well as trained humanist volunteers to help impacted communities. The Disaster Recovery program is sustained through the ongoing partnership between FBB and AHA, and ensures that our community's efforts are centralized and efficient. \n\nBetween 2014-2018, Humanist Disaster Recovery has raised over $250,000 for victims of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, Refugee Children of the U.S. Border, Tropical Cyclone Sam, and the Nepal and Ecuadoran Earthquakes, Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, and Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In addition to grants for recovery efforts, volunteers have also helped to rebuild homes and schools in the following locations: Columbia, South Carolina after the effects of Hurricane Joaquin, in Denham Springs, Louisiana; and in Houston, Texas after the flooding from Hurricane Harvey.\n\nThe American Humanist Association launched the Appignani Humanist Legal Center (AHLC) in 2006 to ensure that humanists' constitutional rights are represented in court. Through amicus activity, litigation, and legal advocacy, a team of cooperating lawyers, including Jim McCollum, Wendy Kaminer, and Michael Newdow, provide legal assistance by challenging perceived violations of the Establishment Clause.\n\n\nThe American Humanist Association has received media attention for its various advertising campaigns; in 2010, the AHA's campaign was said to be the more expensive than similar ad campaigns from the American Atheists and Freedom From Religion Foundation.\n\nIn 2008 the AHA ran ads on buses in Washington, D.C. that proclaimed \"Why believe in a god? Just be good for goodness' sake\", and since 2009 the organization has paid for billboard advertisements nationwide. One such billboard, which stated \"No God...No Problem\" was repeatedly vandalized.\n\nIn 2010 the AHA launched another ad campaign promoting Humanism, which \"The New York Times\" said was the \"first (atheist campaign) to include spots on television and cable\" and was described by CNN as the \"largest, most extensive advertising campaign ever by a godless organization\". The campaign featured violent or sexist quotes from holy books, contrasted with quotes from humanist thinkers, including physicist Albert Einstein, biologist Richard Dawkins, and anthropologist Carleton Coon, and was largely underwritten by Todd Stiefel, a retired pharmaceutical company executive.\n\nIn late 2011 the AHA launched a holiday billboard campaign, placing advertisements in 7 different cities: Kearny, New Jersey; Washington, D.C.; Cranston, Rhode Island; Bastrop, Louisiana; Oregon City, Oregon; College Station, Texas and Rochester Hills, Michigan\", cities where AHA states \"atheists have experienced discrimination due to their lack of belief in a traditional god\". The organization spent more than $200,000 on their campaign which included a billboard reading \"Yes, Virginia, there is no god.\"\n\nIn November 2012, the AHA launched a national ad campaign to promote a new website, KidsWithoutGod.com, with ads using the slogans \"I'm getting a bit old for imaginary friends\" and \"You're Not The Only One.\" The campaign included bus advertising in Washington, DC, a billboard in Moscow, Idaho, and online ads on the family of websites run by Cheezburger and Pandora Radio, as well as Facebook, Reddit, Google, and YouTube. Ads were turned down for content by Disney, Time for Kids and National Geographic Kids.\n\nThe National Day of Reason was created by the American Humanist Association and the Washington Area Secular Humanists in 2003. In addition to serving as a holiday for secularists, the National Day of Reason was created in response to the perceived unconstitutionality of the National Day of Prayer. According to the organizers of the National Day of Reason, the National Day of Prayer, \"violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because it asks federal, state, and local government entities to set aside tax dollar supported time and space to engage in religious ceremonies\".\n\nSeveral organizations associated with the National Day of Reason have organized food drives and blood donations, while other groups have called for an end to prayer invocations at city meetings. Other organizations, such as the Oklahoma Atheists and the Minnesota Atheists, have organized local secular celebrations as alternatives to the National Day of Prayer. Additionally, many individuals affiliated with these atheistic groups choose to protest the official National Day of Prayer.\n\nIn 2012, the American Humanist Association co-sponsored the Reason Rally, a national gathering of \"humanists, atheists, freethinkers and nonbelievers from across the United States and abroad\" in Washington, D.C. The rally, held on the National Mall, had speakers such as Richard Dawkins, James Randi, Adam Savage, and student activist Jessica Ahlqvist. AHA Executive Director Roy Speckhardt also spoke. According to the Huffington Post, the event's attendance was between 8,000-10,000 while the Atlantic reported a crowd of nearly 20,000.\n\nThe AHA also co-sponsored the 2016 Reason Rally, held at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nThe American Humanist Association has named a \"Humanist of the Year\" annually since 1953. It has also granted other honors to numerous leading figures, including Salman Rushdie (Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism 2007), Oliver Stone (Humanist Arts Award, 1996), Katharine Hepburn (Humanist Arts Award 1985), John Dewey (Humanist Pioneer Award, 1954), Jack Kevorkian (Humanist Hero Award, 1996) and Vashti McCollum (Distinguished Service Award, 1991).\n\nThe AHA website presents the list of the following Humanists of the Year:\n\n"}

{"id": "29003900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29003900", "title": "Beyul", "text": "Beyul\n\nAccording to the beliefs of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, Beyul () are hidden valleys often encompassing hundreds of square kilometers, which Padmasambhava blessed as refuges. Tertöns may reveal them from terma at specific and appropriate times. Their locations were kept on scrolls (lamyig or neyig) hidden under rocks and inside caves, monasteries and stupas. They are places where physical and spiritual worlds overlap and Tantric practice effectiveness increases with multiple perception dimensions.\n\nPadmasambhava assigned deities to protect the beyul. Protective forces manifest as snowstorms, mists and snow leopards. Buddhist texts indicate beyul are discovered when the planet is approaching destruction and the world becomes too corrupt for spiritual practice. They describe valleys reminiscent of paradise, which can only be reached with enormous hardship. Pilgrims who travel to these wild and distant places often recount extraordinary experiences similar to those encountered by Buddhist spiritual practitioners on the path to liberation. People who try to force their way in may encounter failure and death.\n\nA recent attempt to open a beyul occurred in 1962, when the Tibetan lama Tulshuk Lingpa journeyed to Sikkim in order to 'open' Beyul Demoshong, a beyul fabled to exist on the slopes of Mount Kanchenjunga straddling the Nepal/Sikkim border. He took with him over 300 followers from across the Himalayas and Tibet, each of whom had given away his or her worldly goods. Their story is told in the recent book, A Step Away from Paradise.\n\nBeyul are often understood to embody dharmapala and lords of the land, which are associated with the geographic features such as mountain, trees, rocks and water sources. Pilgrims make ritual offerings to these beings to appease their wrathful nature, and to renew the symbolic unity that people share with them. It has been argued that this attitude indicates a sustainable approach toward land stewardship.\nIn Nepal and Tibet around Mount Everest are the Khenbalung, Solukhumbu, Rolwaling, Rongshar, Kyirong and Nubri sacred valleys. The Sherpa people discovered Solukhumbu when they left Tibet to escape religious persecution in the 15th and 16th centuries. They entered the valley to seek refuge and made a new homeland there. Buddhist monasteries and sacred mountains have brought many spiritual travelers to Solukhumbu. Beyul are found in the Himalayan regions of Nepal, Tibet, Sikkim, Bhutan, India, China and Pakistan.\n\n"}

{"id": "5958731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5958731", "title": "Catholic imagination", "text": "Catholic imagination\n\nCatholic imagination refers to the Catholic viewpoint that God is present in the whole creation and in human beings, as seen in its sacramental system whereby material things and human beings are channels and sources of God's grace.\n\nThis terminology was popularized by the Roman Catholic priest Andrew Greeley who wrote:The central symbol (of religion) is God. One's \"picture\" of God is in fact a metaphorical narrative of God's relationship with the world and the self as part of the world. ...The Catholic \"classics\" assume a God who is present in the world, disclosing Himself in and through creation. The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be somewhat like God. The Protestant classics, on the other hand, assume a God who is radically absent from the world, and who discloses (Himself) only on rare occasions (especially in Jesus Christ and Him crucified). The world and all its events, objects, and people tend to be radically different from God.Runar Eldebo, a Swedish seminary instructor and correspondent for \"Pietisten\" (an online ecumenical newsletter), provided a Lutheran slant on Greeley's distinction between Catholic imagination and Protestant imagination. Invoking Karl Barth, Eldebo wrote:Protestant imagination is dialectic and makes people pilgrims. It is deep in conflict and antagonistic to the ingredients of a common, human life. Catholic imagination is analogical. It is founded in creation itself and views creation as God in disguise. According to Catholic imagination, God lurks everywhere. According to Protestant imagination, Karl Barth for example, God is hidden everywhere but found only in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Therefore, according to Greeley, Protestants are never at home on earth, they are pilgrims on their way. Catholics, meanwhile, like to dwell on earth. They enjoy life and are not in a hurry to get to heaven because God lurks everywhere, especially where you do not expect her to be.\nAmerican Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor illustrated the sacramental understanding of the world in her work \"Novelist and Believer\":St. Augustine wrote that the things of the world pour forth from God in a double way: intellectually into the minds of the angels and physically into the world of things. To the person who believes this – as the western world did up until a few centuries ago – this physical, sensible world is good because it proceeds from a divine source ... When [Joseph] Conrad said that his aim as an artist was to render the highest possible justice to the visible universe, he was speaking with the novelist's surest instinct. The artist penetrates the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality.\n\nAccording to Greeley aspects of the Catholic imagination include community, salvation, hierarchy, sacred place/sacred time, and sacred desire. As one reviewer of Greeley's book noted:\n\nThe cultural works include the Cologne Cathedral, Bernini's \"St. Theresa in Ecstasy\", Marian poems by Gerard Manley Hopkins and François Villon, Italian American films (especially those directed by Martin Scorsese), James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", \"The Power and the Glory\" by Graham Greene, the slow movement from Mozart's Piano Concerto no. 26, Verdi's \"La Traviata\", St. Xavier del Bac Mission, and Lars von Trier's motion picture, \"Breaking the Waves\".\n\nIn \"The Catholic Imagination\" (2000), Greeley's aim is to \"specify how the Catholic imaginative tradition differs from other versions of the Western Christian story.\" It informs its research through the work of David Tracy, especially \"The Analogical Imagination: Christian Theology and the Culture of Pluralism\" (1981). This work suggests a strategy informed by an analogical imagination as an answer to the theological question of how to \"form a new and inevitably complex theological strategy that will avoid privatism\" in religious discourse that embraces pluralism. Greeley argues that the metaphor inherent in the Catholic imagination is indicative of the necessity to use metaphor in order to relate knowledge generally:Cognitive psychologists have recently begun to insist that metaphors – statements that one reality is like another reality – are the fundamental tools of human knowledge. We understand better and explain more adequately one reality to ourselves by comparing it to another reality which we already know.\nTracy sees the tendencies of Catholic artists, writers, and theologians to emphasize a metaphorical discourse – and a way to know the world through analogy – versus a Protestant tendency to stress the disconnect inherent in metaphor, as in a dialectical imagination, which Tracy designates as \"a necessary corrective to the analogical imagination.\"\n\nGreeley states:The love of God for [Catholics], in perhaps the boldest of all metaphors (and one with which the Church has been perennially uneasy), is like the passionate love between man and woman. God lurks in aroused human love and reveals Himself to us (the two humans first of all) through it.\n\nContemporary art critic and art historian Eleanor Heartney addresses these interpretations of the Catholic imagination in her work \"Postmodern Heretics: The Catholic Imagination in Contemporary Art\", bringing to light the complex relationships underlying Catholicism's sacramental vision and the \"physically provocative work it seems to inspire.\" She discusses how sexualization of the spiritual in contemporary art and the adverse reactions it produces – which through the 1980s to today came to be part of what is known as the \"culture war\" – is affected in some work by a distinctly Catholic imagination. Heartney draws this connection from the work of those artists who grew up as Catholic or were in some way surrounded by Catholicism in their own lives. Emphasis on the body, its fluids, processes, or sexual behaviors as a site of turning cultural stereotype on its head points to a sacramental influence or underpinning that acknowledges the body and its senses as a way to know the world. She references Greeley and Tracy \"to posit the existence of a distinctly Catholic consciousness which is deeply immersed in sensuality and sexuality.\"\n\nHeartney questions why the carnal understanding of the world seems to be so inflammatory in American society, and discusses whether this is \"peculiarly American\". She reveals that in the contemporary United States, the culture war seems to pit artists with the Catholic analogical underpinning \"against spokespeople for a 'Christian' (read evangelical) America for whom flesh is a condition to be transcended rather than celebrated.\"\n\nLeo Steinberg's controversial \"The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion\" points out that, \"Renaissance Art ... became the first Christian art in a thousand years to confront the Incarnation entire, the upper and the lower body together, not excluding even the body's sexual component.\" He goes on to reference several works in which Christ's genitals are the focal point of the image, intentionally, so as to counter a heresy denying Christ's humanity. He indicates that the sexuality of Christ – of God – is indeed within the canon of Catholicism itself. This controversy continues into the contemporary Catholic religion as well, revealing still a deep-seated uneasiness over how fleshly an imagination is too fleshly an imagination. Greeley makes this point:The propensity to protect God from profanation, at the heart of the dialectical imagination, is very strong even among Catholics because official Catholicism has yet to make up its mind whether it really believes that sexual passion is not in itself lewd or lustful.Postmodern artists and artists today, influenced by the Catholic imagination, who are using aspects of the body to pose their questions to society, are frequently working out of the inherently complex contradictions of sacramental vision.\n\nSee also: Lisa Yuskavage, Kiki Smith, Andy Warhol, Tim Miller, David Wojnarowicz\n\n"}
{"id": "21128557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21128557", "title": "Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf", "text": "Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf\n\nImperial Count Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (September 19, 1727 - May 28, 1752) was the charismatic leader of the Single Brethren's Choir of the Moravian Church and of Herrnhaag (The Lord’s Grove), a Christian religious community built near Büdingen by his father, Count Nicholas Ludwig, head of the \"Brüdergemeine\" or Moravian Unity. Christian Renatus, affectionately known as Christel, took his father’s marriage religion (\"Ehereligion\") literally, proclaiming himself to be the living \"Sidewound of Christ\" in 1748, which meant he was the embodiment of Christ's sacrificial and compassionate love.\n\nThe younger Zinzendorf and his co-elder of the Single Brethren, Joachim Rubusch, also proclaimed themselves to be married to the Sidewound. This derived in part from the teaching of Zinzendorf’s father that all souls are female, regardless of gender, so that they may be married to Christ. (This image is derived from the fact that \"soul\" in German, \"die Seele\", is always a feminine noun.[\"Cassel\"'s \"German-English Dictionary\", entry \"die Seele\".] It was also in 1748 that Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf declared all Single Brethren to be Sisters and therefore Brides of Christ.\n\nThe compounding of sexuality and spirituality at Herrnhaag led to virulent attacks from outside and within the church, threatening to undo the goodwill with other denominations that the elder Zinzendorf had sought for decades. He dismissed his son from his positions and brought him to England for the remaining three years of Christian's life.\n\nAfter his death, Christian's followers in Pennsylvania named a settlement farm after him. Since there was a flowing spring there it was called \"Christiansbrunn\", Christian's Spring. while church leaders systematically destroyed most of the documents referring to the events at Herrnhaag. Only within the past two decades has a new generation of scholars and historians begun to reexamine that period to determine what happened.\nZinzendorf was born just a month after the spiritual awakening experience on August 13, 1727, that signaled the renewal of the Ancient Unity of Brethren, in which Moravian exiles on the lands of his father committed themselves to a life in Christ. Both his parents were deeply committed to this ideal. His father and his mother, \"née\" Countess Erdmuthe Dorothea Reuss-Ebersdorf, came from Pietist families that stressed the indwelling of the spirit. His parents considered their relationship to be a marriage of champions in which the goal was serving Christ. The young Zinzendorf was left in the care of his mother for most of his youth while his father pursued church activities elsewhere. His effeminacy was noted by nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century historians who typically attributed it his being raised in the company of women: \"Christian Renatus . . . had all the ardor without the virility characteristic of his father.\" \n\nThe strong mother/weak or distant father parenting style typically associated with early psychoanalytic attempts to explain homosexuality was also used to further discredit Zinzendorf. As a student, Zinzendorf was known for being frivolous, even bringing a cat to class. At the age of sixteen, he was named vice-elder of the Single Brothers Choir. Moravian communities were dedicated to serving Christ. The traditional family unit was abandoned in order to direct all residents' energies to that goal. Much like the Shakers, Moravian residents lived in groups or choirs according to gender, marital status and age.\n\nMany of Zinzendorf's beliefs and acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; he lives in me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. When you speak with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, and when you have a word from me, so too you have it from him.” Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, painting and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words \"Gebrochne Augen\"(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.\n\nThe idea of Christ living in another was not uncommon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is a fundamental belief shared with the Quakers and Shakers, who also had roots in Pietism and the indwelling of Christ.\n\nHerrnhaag was a community designed by the elder Zinzendorf, whose inhabitants were to live under the direct rule of Christ with Christian Renatus as his representative. At Herrnhaag, Christel was the link between the spiritual and the earthly as the spirit took human form. During the 1748 Single Brothers Festival at Herrnhaag, Christel and his assistants entered wearing white robes, implying it was Christ who was actually entering. Later that day, Christel and twelve assistants led Communion, further representing Christ and the apostles. During the service, those in attendance believed that the Sidehole of Christ was literally standing before them in the bodily forms of Christel and Rubusch, his co-leader of the brothers. Christel sang a welcoming hymn for Christ entering the hall, and while kissing, the brothers believed they were literally kissing the Sidehole.\n\nThe combination of sexuality and spirituality shown at Herrnhaag was not unknown in Christian history, but it caused increasing scandal both within and without the church, particularly embarrassing for Nicholas, \"who was trying to be recognized as a rightful theologian after joining the confession of Augsburg\" in 1748. Even Christel’s mother was concerned, realizing the events taking place at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn were at the edge where metaphor and reality meet. Referring to a plowshare that can be raised and lowered, she later wrote to her son that \"I sometimes said we have already put the peg in the last hole. If we wanted to remain in the world, the Savior would have to make three or four holes further back and lower down.\"\n\nIn addition to increasingly embarrassing scandal and rumor, the cost of sustaining Herrnhaag and its numerous festivals put a severe financial strain on the church at a time when its missionary efforts were expanding around the world. Events reached such a point that Christel’s father denounced what was happening at Herrnhaag and ordered Christel to attend him in England. \"When the twenty-two-year-old returned to Herrnhaag, he was physically and mentally broken. In August 1750 he founded a \"Bund auf die Marter Gottes\" (Covenant on the ordeal of God). During this 'phase of consolation' ordered by his father, he also composed several 'purified' poems.\"\n\nZinzendorf died in a house in Dean's Yard of Westminster Abbey, London, on May 28, 1752, from a hemorrhage due to tuberculosis, with John Nitschmann, his former tutor, beside him. He was buried on the grounds of Lindsey House, \"Sharon,\" the Moravian Graveyard located in Chelsea outside London, where his father lived at that time while directing the worldwide missionary effort of the church.\n\nWhen the Moravian Brethren and Sisters refused to forswear their allegiance to the elder Zinzendorf and sever their connection to the Moravian Church in the 1750s at the insistence of Gustav Friedrich, Count of Isenburg-Büdingen, Herrnhaag was closed and a great number of Moravians came to Bethlehem and Nazareth in Pennsylvania. A farming community had already been established near Nazareth for the Single Brethren named \"Christiansbrunn\", Christian's Spring. One of the brothers wrote a poem stating that Christel lived again in the Congregation at the spring and that the flowing waters restored him “more and more.” \n\nFor more than 200 years after his death, Christel was looked upon as a failure by Moravian historians and scholars, who saw him as weak, effeminate, ineffectual and a grave disappointment to his father whose trust he had betrayed. The only way most Moravians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries knew him was by the inclusion of several of his hymns in various Moravian hymnals, the most famous being “My Redeemer, overwhelmed with anguish, went to Olivet for me.”\n\nIndeed, the entire period (approximately 1747-1749) became known as the \"Sifting Time\" from Luke 22:31: “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat.” Nicholas Zinzendorf called the ensuing scandal an “unbridled freedom of the flesh.” His representative told the residents at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn that it was impossible to be \"truly unified with our Husband\" while living on earth. He further added that the residents had mistaken metaphor for reality and wrongly believed that the brothers were actually sisters.\n\nHistorians for the next two hundred years accepted this view of events and wrote off what happened as a time of embarrassing excess from which the church was saved only by the timely intervention of Nicholas.\n\nDetermining exactly what happened was made exceedingly difficult due to extensive destruction of documents amounting to official censorship that began in the eighteenth century by church officials and even archivists. There was a general shunning of the period that lasted well into the twentieth century, and almost no pertinent documents remain in either in the major Moravian archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania or Herrnhut, Germany.\n\nA new generation of scholars and historians interested in determining exactly what happened have been able to locate documents in private collections and other sources. An indication of renewed interest in Christian Renatus and what he meant to his time was shown in September, 2008 when a birthday festival was held in his honor in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania based on eighteenth-century sources and sponsored by the Historic Bethlehem Partnership, the Moravian Music Foundation and the Moravian Archives.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16973885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16973885", "title": "Culture of honor (Southern United States)", "text": "Culture of honor (Southern United States)\n\nThe traditional culture of the Southern United States has been called a \"culture of honor\", that is, a culture where people avoid intentionally offending others, and maintain a reputation for not accepting improper conduct by others. A prevalent theory as to why the American South had or may have this culture is an assumed regional belief in retribution to enforce one's rights and deter predation against one’s family, home and possessions. The concept was tested by social scientists Richard Nisbett and Dov Cohen in their book \"Culture of Honor\" and repopularized by a discussion in Chapter Six of \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nThe \"culture of honor\" in the Southern United States is hypothesized by some social scientists to have its roots in the livelihoods of the early settlers who first inhabited the region. Unlike settlers with an agricultural heritage (mainly from the densely populated South East England and East Anglia) who settled in New England, the Southern United States was settled by herders from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Northern England and the West Country. Herds, unlike crops, are vulnerable to theft because they are mobile and there is little government wherewithal to enforce property rights of herd animals. The theory is that developing a reputation for violent retribution against those who stole herd animals was one way to discourage theft.\n\nThis thesis is limited, however, by modern evidence that a culture of honor in the American South is strongest not in the hill country, where this thesis suggests it has its cultural origins, but in Southern lowlands. These observers argue that poverty or religion, which has been distinctive in the American South since the Second Great Awakening in the 19th century, may be a more important source of this cultural phenomenon.\n\nOther theories point out that the culture of honor may have its roots in the settlement of the region by members of British aristocratic families.\n\nThe Southern culture of honor also includes a notion that ladies should not be insulted by gentlemen. Southern gentlemen are also expected to be chivalrous towards women, in words and deeds.\n\nAlthough \"culture of honor\" qualities have been generally associated with men in the southern United States, women in this region have also been affected and even shown some of the same qualities. In \"Culture of Honor\", it is stated that women play a part in the culture, both \"through their role in the socialization process, as well as active participation.\" By passing these ideas along to their children, they are taking part in social conditioning.\n\nLaboratory research has demonstrated that men in honor cultures perceive interpersonal threats more readily than do men in other cultures, including increases in cortisol and testosterone levels following insults. In culture-of-honor states, high school students were found to be more likely to bring a weapon to school in the past month and over a 20-year period, there were more than twice as many school shootings per capita. According to Lindsey Osterman and Ryan Brown in \"Culture of Honor and Violence Against the Self\", \"[i]ndividuals (particularly Whites) living in honor states are at an especially high risk for committing suicide.\"\n\nThe historian David Hackett Fischer, a Professor of History at Brandeis University, makes a case for an enduring genetic basis for a \"willingness to resort to violence\" (citing especially the finding of high blood levels of testosterone as discussed above) in the four main chapters of his book \"Albion's Seed\". He proposes that a Southern propensity for violence is inheritable by genetic changes wrought over generations living in traditional herding societies in Northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Irish Border Region. He proposes that this propensity has been transferred to other ethnic groups by shared culture, whence it can be traced to different urban populations of the United States. However, honor cultures were and are widely prevalent in Africa and many other places.\n\nRandolph Roth, in his \"American Homicide\" (2009), states that the idea of a culture of honor is oversimplified. He argues that the violence often committed by Southerners resulted from social tensions. He hypothesizes that when people feel that they are denied social success or the means to attain it, they will be more prone to commit violent acts. His argument is that Southerners were in tension, possibly due to poor Whites being marginalized by rich Whites, free and enslaved Blacks being denied basic rights, and rich and politically empowered Whites having their power threatened by Northern politicians pushing for more federal control of the South, especially over abolition. He argues that issues over honor just triggered the already present hostility, and that people took their frustration out through violent acts often on the surface over issues of honor. He draws historical records of violence across the U.S. and Europe to show that violence largely accompanies perceptions of political weakness and the inability to advance oneself in society. Roth also shows that although the South was \"obsessed with honor\" in the mid-18th century, there was relatively little homicide. Barring under-reported crime against some groups, low homicide may simply have been gentlemanly self-restraint at a time when social order was stable, a trend that reverses in the 19th century and later.\n\nA 2016 study suggests that honor culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under Southern presidents are \"twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43501", "title": "Edith Stein", "text": "Edith Stein\n\nEdith Stein (religious name Teresia Benedicta a Cruce ; also known as St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross; 12 October 1891 – 9 August 1942), was a German Jewish philosopher who converted to Roman Catholicism and became a Discalced Carmelite nun. She is canonized as a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church, and she is one of six co-patron saints of Europe.\n\nShe was born into an observant Jewish family, but was an atheist by her teenage years. Moved by the tragedies of World War I, in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis from the University of Göttingen in 1916, she obtained an assistantship at the University of Freiburg.\n\nFrom reading the works of the reformer of the Carmelite Order, Teresa of Ávila, she was drawn to the Catholic faith. She was baptized on 1 January 1922 into the Roman Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun, but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentors. She then taught at a Catholic school of education in Speyer. As a result of the requirement of an \"Aryan certificate\" for civil servants promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, she had to quit her teaching position.\n\nShe was admitted to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Cologne the following October. She received the religious habit of the Order as a novice in April 1934, taking the religious name Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. In 1938, she and her sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern sister (tertiaries of the Order, who would handle the community′s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands, for their safety. Despite the Nazi invasion of that state in 1940, they remained undisturbed until they were arrested by the Nazis on 2 August 1942 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where they died in the gas chamber on 9 August 1942.\n\nStein was born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), Lower Silesia, into an observant Jewish family. She was the youngest of 11 children and was born on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Hebrew calendar, which combined to make her a favorite of her mother. She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's strong religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an atheist.\n\nThough her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent Stein to study at the University of Breslau (also known as \"Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität\").\n\nIn April 1913 Stein arrived in Göttingen in order to study for the summer semester with Edmund Husserl. By the end of the summer she had decided to pursue her degree as a philosopher under Husserl and \"Empathy\" had been chosen as her thesis topic. Her studies were interrupted in July 1914 because of the outbreak of World War I. She then served as a volunteer wartime Red Cross nurse in an infectious diseases hospital at Märisch-Weisskirchen in 1915. In 1916, Stein moved to Freiburg in order to complete her dissertation on Empathy. Shortly before receiving her degree she agreed to become Husserl's assistant. After her dissertation entitled \"Zum Problem der Einfühlung\" (\"On the Problem of Empathy\") was awarded on August 3, 1916, which made her a doctor of philosophy with the \"summa cum laude\" honor, she began working independently as Husserl's assistant. In his 2007 thesis, \"The Philosophical Contributions of Edith Stein\", John C. Wilhelmsson argues that Stein influenced the work of Husserl significantly during this period. She then became a member of the faculty at the University of Freiburg, where she worked as a teaching assistant to Husserl, who had transferred to that institution. Because she was a woman, Husserl did not support her submitting her habilitational thesis (a prerequisite for an academic chair) to the University of Freiburg in 1918. Her other thesis, \"Psychische Kausalität\" (\"Sentient Causality\"), submitted at the University of Göttingen the following year, was likewise rejected.\n\nWhile Stein had earlier contacts with Roman Catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic St. Teresa of Ávila during summer holidays in Bad Bergzabern in 1921 that prompted her conversion. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the religious life, she obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns' school in Speyer from 1923 to 1931. While there, she translated Thomas Aquinas' \"De Veritate\" (\"Of Truth\") into German, familiarized herself with Roman Catholic philosophy in general, and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, Husserl, to Thomism. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church-affiliated Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in Münster, but antisemitic legislation passed by the Nazi government forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to Pope Pius XI, she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime \"to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name.\"\n\nHer letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the Pope ever read it. However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (\"With Burning Anxiety\"), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the Concordat between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.\n\nStein entered the Discalced Carmelite monastery St. Maria vom Frieden (Our Lady of Peace) in Cologne in 1933 and took the religious name of Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. There she wrote her metaphysical book \"Endliches und ewiges Sein\" (\"Finite and Eternal Being\"), which attempted to combine the philosophies of St. Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus and Husserl.\n\nTo avoid the growing Nazi threat, her Order transferred her and her sister, Rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the Carmel, to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands. There she wrote \"Studie über Joannes a Cruce: Kreuzeswissenschaft\" (\"Studies on John of the Cross: The Science of the Cross\"). In her testament of 6 June 1939 she wrote: \"I beg the Lord to take my life and my death … for all concerns of the sacred hearts of Jesus and Mary and the holy [C]hurch, especially for the preservation of our holy [O]rder, in particular the Carmelite monasteries of Cologne and Echt, as atonement for the unbelief of the Jewish People, and that the Lord will be received by [H]is own people and [H]is kingdom shall come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world, at last for my loved ones, living or dead, and for all God gave to me: that none of them shall go astray.\"\n\nStein's move to Echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the Carmelite rule. After having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in Echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community Latin and philosophy.\n\nEven prior to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Stein believed she would not survive the war, going as far to write the Prioress to request her permission to \"allow [Stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace\" and made a will. Her fellow sisters would later recount how Stein began \"quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger\" after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940.\n\nUltimately, she was not safe in the Netherlands. The Dutch Bishops' Conference had a public statement read in all the churches of the nation on 20 July 1942 condemning Nazi racism. In a retaliatory response on 26 July 1942 the Reichskommissar of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart ordered the arrest of all Jewish converts who had previously been spared. Along with two hundred and forty-three baptized Jews living in the Netherlands, Stein was arrested by the SS on 2 August 1942. Stein and her sister Rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of Amersfoort and Westerbork before being deported to Auschwitz. A Dutch official at Westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and calm, he offered her an escape plan. Stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating, \"If somebody intervened at this point and took away her chance to share in the fate of her brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation.\"\n\nOn 7 August 1942, early in the morning, 987 Jews were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. It was probably on 9 August that Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, her sister, and many more of her people were killed in a mass gas chamber.\n\nStein was beatified as a martyr on 1 May 1987 in Cologne, Germany by Pope John Paul II and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in Vatican City. The miracle that was the basis for her canonization was the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of paracetamol (acetaminophen), which causes hepatic necrosis. The young girl's father, Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, immediately called together relatives and prayed for St. Teresa's intercession. Shortly thereafter the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up completely healthy. Dr. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to Church tribunals, stating: \"I was willing to say that it was miraculous.\" McCarthy would later attend St. Teresa's canonization.\n\nSt. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross is one of the six patron saints of Europe, together with Sts. Benedict of Nursia, Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena.\n\nToday there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in Darmstadt, Germany, Hengelo, Netherlands, and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Also named for her are a women's dormitory at the University of Tübingen and a classroom building at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nThe philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre published a book in 2006 titled \"Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922\", in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with Martin Heidegger, whose actions during the Nazi era, according to MacIntyre, suggested a \"bifurcation of personality.\"\n\nPlaywright Arthur Giron wrote \"Edith Stein\", a play that was inspired by Stein's life. It was produced at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 1988.\n\nIn 1995, Hungarian film director, Márta Mészáros made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title \"A hetedik szoba\" (The Seventh Room/Chamber), starring Maia Morgenstern. \n\nIn 2008, a memorial \"Stolperstein\" (Polish: \"kamienie pamięci\") was placed near Stein's childhood home at 38 ul. Nowowiejska (formerly the Michaelisstrasse) in Wrocław.\n\nIn 2009 her bust was installed at the Walhalla Memorial near Regensburg, Germany. In June 2009 the International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein (IASPES) was founded, and held its first international conference at Maynooth University, Ireland in order to advance the philosophical writings of Stein.\n\nOn 6 June 2014, the 70th anniversary of D-Day, a bell dedicated to her was named by Prince Charles at Bayeux Cathedral.\n\nAlso in 2014, the book \"Edith Stein and Regina Jonas: Religious Visionaries in the Time of the Death Camps\", by Emily Leah Silverman, was published.\n\nThe beatification of St. Teresa Benedicta as a martyr generated criticism. Critics argued that she was murdered because she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Catholic faith, and that, in the words of Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to \"carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities\" because \"official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining Stein's Catholic faith with her death with 'fellow Jews' in Auschwitz\". The position of the Catholic Church is that St. Teresa Benedicta also died because of the Dutch episcopacy's public condemnation of Nazi racism in 1942; in other words, that she died because of the moral teaching of the Church and is thus a true martyr.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970945", "title": "Freedom of contract", "text": "Freedom of contract\n\nFreedom of contract is the freedom of private or public individuals and groups (of any legal entity) to form nonviolent contracts without government restrictions. This is opposed to government restrictions such as minimum- or maximum-wage laws, competition laws, economic sanctions, restrictions on price fixing, or restrictions on contracting with second-class citizens or undocumented workers. The freedom to contract is the underpinning of \"laissez-faire\" economics and is a cornerstone of free-market libertarianism. Through freedom of contract, individuals possess a general freedom to choose with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract.\n\nHenry James Sumner Maine proposed that social structures evolve from roles derived from social status to those based on contractual freedom. A status system establishes obligations and relationships by birth, but a contract presumes that the individuals are free and equal. Modern libertarianism, such as that advanced by Robert Nozick, sees freedom of contract as the expression of the independent decisions of separate individuals pursuing their own interests under a \"minimal state.\"\n\nIn 1902 a New York baker named Joseph Lochner was fined for violating a state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work. He sued the state on the grounds that he was denied his right to \"due process.\" Lochner claimed that he had the right to freely contract with his employees and that the state had unfairly interfered with this. In 1905, the Supreme Court used the due process clause to declare unconstitutional the New York state statute imposing a limit on hours of work. Rufus Wheeler Peckham wrote for the majority: \"Under that provision no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment.\"\n\nWriting in dissent, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. accused the majority of basing its decision on laissez-faire ideology. He believed that it was making law based on economics rather than interpreting the constitution. He believed that \"Liberty of Contract\" did not exist and that it was not intended in the Constitution.\n\nIn his \"Liberty of Contract\" (1909), Roscoe Pound critiqued freedom-of-contract laws by laying out case after case in which labor rights were struck down by state and federal Supreme Courts. Pound argued the courts' rulings were \"simply wrong\" from the standpoint of common law and \"even from that of a sane individualism\" (482). Pound further compared the situation of labor legislation in his time to common opinion of usury and that the two were \"of the same type\" (484). Pound lamented that the legacy of such \"academic\" and \"artificial\" judicial rulings for liberty of contract engendered a \"lost respect for the courts\" but predicted a \"bright\" future for labor legislation (486-487).\n\nThe Supreme Court applied the liberty of contract doctrine sporadically over the next three decades but generally upheld reformist legislation as being within the states' police power. In 1937 the Court reversed its view in the case \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\". In that case the court upheld a Washington state law setting a minimum wage.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the English judiciary espoused \"freedom of contract\" as a generally applicable feature of public policy, best expressed in \"Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson\" by Sir George Jessel MR. In the later 20th century, the view of the common law had changed completely. In \"George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd\", Lord Denning MR compared \"freedom of contract\" with oppression of the weak, as he outlined the development the law had undergone.\n\n\n\n"}

They lived at 70 Bristo Street in Edinburgh's South Side.\n\nHe went to school at George Heriot's School a short distance from his family home and was the School Dux. He then Studied Mathematics at Edinburgh University. With the aid of scholarships, he did Further studies at Cambridge University and was able to go to Germany to study at the University of Göttingen. At the outbreak of World War I he returned to Britain. In 1916 he joined the Royal Flying Corps. It is unclear if he saw active service but it inspired an interest in aerodynamics.\n\nResearching aeronautics at the National Physical Laboratory, Levy published papers and books on mathematical applications pertaining to aeronautics. He also wrote about differential equations and probability. After leaving the laboratory, he became a professor of mathematics at the Royal College of Science of Imperial College London where he later served as the head of the department. At Imperial, he is believed to have greatly improved the department of mathematics, and in recognition to his contribution, he later became the dean of the Royal College of Science.\n\nIn 1916 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Even though the host and guests may see each other often socially, one day's gathering can never be repeated exactly. Viewed this way, the meeting is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime occasion. The host, accordingly, must in true sincerity take the greatest care with every aspect of the gathering and devote himself entirely to ensuring that nothing is rough. The guests, for their part, must understand that the gathering cannot occur again and, appreciating how the host has flawlessly planned it, must also participate with true sincerity. This is what is meant by \"one time, one meeting.\"\nThis passage established the \"yojijukugo\" (four-letter idiomatic) form \"ichi-go ichi-e\" () known today.\n\n\"Ichi-go ichi-e\" is linked with Zen Buddhism and concepts of transience.

In a life-or-death struggle, there is no chance to \"try again.\" Even though techniques may be attempted many times in the dojo, each should be seen as a singular and decisive event.

His statement may have been made in jest that the trial was a mockery, or he may have actually intended to reflect on the philosophical position that truth is hard to ascertain. The Greek word rendered as \"truth\" in English translations is \"aletheia\", which literally means \"unconcealed\" and connotes sincerity in addition to factuality and reality. \n\nThis verse reflects the Christian tradition of the \"guiltlessness of Jesus\" in Pilate's Court. The innocence of Jesus is important in the Gospel of John, given that it emphasizes Jesus as the Lamb of God.\n\nNote that Jesus, although he does not respond to Pilate's question (perhaps because Pilate \"went out again\" before giving him a chance to) knows the answer. During his prayer in Gethsemane, Jesus tells God, \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\" (John 17:17)\n\nIn addition to the guiltlessness of Jesus this verse also reflects the rejection of the truth of God: Jesus, the witness to truth was rejected, ignored and condemned.\n\nThis verse has been widely quoted and alluded to in culture and literature, particularly in that of philosophical nature. While Pilate's question -- whether intended philosophically, jestfully, rhetorically, or born of frustration at the lack of a plain answer -- is by no means the only incident of someone questioning the nature of truth, it has been drawn upon many times as a significant occurrence thereof. \n\nFrancis Bacon uses this musing to open his essay \"Of Truth\", saying that Pilate \"would not stay for an answer\". He uses this to introduce his theme of truth as an affirmation of faith.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche wrote of the line and extended praise to Pilate:\n\"Do I still have to add that in the entire New Testament there is only \"one\" solitary figure one is obliged to respect? Pilate, the Roman governor. To take a Jewish affair \"seriously\" - he cannot persuade himself to do that. One Jew more or less - what does it matter ?... The noble scorn of a Roman before whom an impudent misuse of the word 'truth' was carried on has enriched the New Testament with the only expression \"which\" \"possesses\" \"value\" - which is its criticism, its \"annihilation\" even: 'What is truth?...\" (Nietzsche, writing in \"The Antichrist\", §46)\n\nMikhail Bulgakov fictionally expands on the relationship between Pilate and Jesus in his novel \"Master and Margarita\". Specific reference to John 18:38 comes in Chapter 2 of the novel entitled \"Pontius Pilate\", in which he asks the very question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus (\"Jeshua Ha-Notsri\" - \"Jesus of Nazareth\" in Hebrew).\n\nJ. L. Austin, the ordinary-language philosopher, in a symposium on truth, comments:\n'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Pilate was in advance of his time. For 'truth' itself is an abstract noun, a camel, that is, of a logical construction, which cannot get past the eye even of a grammarian. We approach it cap and categories in hand : we ask ourselves whether Truth is a substance (the Truth, the Body of Knowledge), or a quality (something like the colour red, inhering in truths), or a relation ('correspondence'). But philosophers should take something more nearly their own size to strain at. What needs discussing rather is the use, or certain uses, of the word 'true.' In vino, possibly, 'veritas,' but in a sober symposium\n'verum.'\n\nIn his novella (and play) \"Home Truths\", David Lodge lets the writer Adrian Ludlow quote \"What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer\" when he is interviewed by the journalist Fanny Tarrant, known for her vicious and perhaps not entirely truthful interviews.\n\n\n"}

He was known as a scholar of William Shakespeare and many of his poems were Shakespearean sonnets. He was well-known and respected amongst the Transcendentalists, though he had a mental breakdown early in his career.\n\nBorn in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became associated with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, then as a student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called \"Essays and Poems\" in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.\n\nVery was born on August 28, 1813, in Salem, Massachusetts and spent much of his childhood at sea. He was the oldest of six children, born out of wedlock to two first cousins; his sister Lydia also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her atheistic beliefs known to all. She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and not a legal one. His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the War of 1812 and was held in Nova Scotia for a time by the British as a prisoner of war. When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a shipmaster, took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a cabin boy on a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. His father died on the return trip, apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia.\n\nAs a boy, Very was studious, well-behaved, and solitary. By 1827, he left school when his mother told him he must take the place of his father and care for the family. After working at an auction house, Very became a paid assistant to the principal of a private school in Salem as a teenager. The principal, Henry Kemble Oliver, exposed his young assistant to philosophers and writers, including James Mackintosh, to influence his religious beliefs and counteract his mother's atheism. He composed a poem for the dedication of a new Unitarian church in Salem: \"O God; On this, our temple, rest thy smile, Till bent with days its tower shall nod\".\n\nVery enrolled at Harvard College in 1834. During his college years, he was shy, studious, and ambitious of literary fame. He had become interested in the works of Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. His first few poems were published in his hometown newspaper, the \"Salem Observer\", while he completed his studies. He graduated from Harvard in 1836, ranked number two in his class. He was chosen to speak at his commencement; his address was titled \"Individuality\". After graduating, Very served as a tutor in Greek before entering Harvard Divinity School, thanks to the financial assistance of an uncle. Though Very never completed his divinity degree, he held temporary pastorates in Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.\n\nVery became known for his ability to draw people into literature, and was asked to speak at a lyceum in his hometown of Salem in 1837. There he was befriended by Elizabeth Peabody, who wrote to Emerson suggesting Very lecture in Concord. In 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson arranged a talk by Very at the Concord Lyceum. Very lectured on epic poetry on April 4 of that year, after he had walked twenty miles from Salem to Concord to deliver it. Emerson made up for the meager $10 payment by inviting Very to his home for dinner. Emerson signed Very's personal copy of \"Nature\" with the words: \"Har[mony] of Man with Nature Must Be Reconciled With God\".\n\nFor a time, Very tried to recruit Nathaniel Hawthorne as a brother figure in his life. Though Hawthorne treated him kindly, he was not impressed by Very. Unlike Hawthorne, Emerson found him \"remarkable\" and, when Very showed up at his home unannounced along with Cornelius Conway Felton in 1838, Emerson invited several other friends, including Henry David Thoreau, to meet him. Emerson, however, was surprised at Very's behavior in larger groups. \"When he is in the room with other persons, speech stops, as if there were a corpse in the apartment\", he wrote. Even so, in May 1838, the same month Very published his \"Epic Poetry\" lecture in the \"Christian Examiner\", Emerson brought Very to a meeting of the Transcendental Club, where the topic of discussion was \"the question of mysticism\". At the meeting, held at the home of Caleb Stetson in Medford, Massachusetts, Very was actively engaged in the discussion, building his reputation as a mystic within that circle.\n\nVery was known as an eccentric, prone to odd behavior and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, \"I felt within me a new will... it was not a feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me\". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being \"borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey\". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, \"I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father\". Very also claimed that he was under the influence of the Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, \"cannot the spirit parse & spell?\" Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his \"sacrifice of Beauty\".\n\nOne of Very's students, a fellow native of Salem named Samuel Johnson Jr., said that people ridiculed Very behind his back since he had \"gained the fame of being cracked (or crazy, if you are not acquainted with Harvard technicalities)\". During one of his tutoring sessions, Very declared that he was \"infallible: that he was a man of heaven, and superior to all the world around him\". He then cried out to his students, \"Flee to the mountains, for the end of all things is at hand\". Harvard president Josiah Quincy III relieved Very of his duties, referring to a \"nervous collapse\" that required him to be left in the care of his younger brother Washington Very, himself a freshman at Harvard. After returning to Salem, he visited Elizabeth Peabody on September 16, 1838, apparently having given up his rule \"not to speak or look at women\". As she recalled,\n\nAfter this, Very told her she would soon feel different, explaining, \"I am the Second Coming\". He performed similar \"baptisms\" to other people throughout Salem, including ministers. It was Reverend Charles Wentworth Upham who finally had him committed.\nVery was institutionalized for a month at a hospital near Boston, the McLean Asylum, as he wrote, \"contrary to my will\". While there, he finished an essay on \"Hamlet\", arguing that the play is about \"the great reality of a soul unsatisfied in its longings after immortality\" and that \"Hamlet has been called mad, but as we think, Shakespeare thought more of his madness than he did of the wisdom of the rest of the play\". During his stay at the hospital, Very lectured his fellow patients on Shakespeare and on poetry in general.\n\nHe was released on October 17, 1838, though he refused to renounce his beliefs. His fellow patients reportedly thanked him as he left. McLean's superintendent Luther Bell took credit for saving him \"from the delusion of being a prophet extraordinaire\", which Luther thought was caused by Very's digestive system being \"entirely out of order\". The same month he was released, Very stayed with Emerson at his home in Concord for a week. While he was visiting, Emerson wrote in his journal on October 29, \"J. Very charmed us all by telling us he hated us all.\"\n\nAmos Bronson Alcott wrote of Very in December 1838:\n\nEmerson saw a kindred spirit in Very and defended his sanity. As he wrote to Margaret Fuller, \"Such a mind cannot be lost\". Emerson was sympathetic with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the \"Divinity School Address\". He helped Very publish a small volume, \"Essays and Poems\" in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the \"Western Messenger\" between 1838 and 1840 as well as in \"The Dial\", the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, \"Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I felt a little sad at the aspect of the piece.\" He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten by the end of the nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.\n\nVery continued writing throughout his life, though sparingly. Many of his later poems were never collected but only distributed in manuscript form among the Transcendentalists. In January 1843, his work was included in the first issue of \"The Pioneer\", a journal edited by James Russell Lowell which also included the first publication of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\".\n\nJones Very believed his role as a prophet would last only twelve months. By September 1839, his role was complete. Emerson suggested that Very's temporary mental instability was worth the message he had delivered. In his essay \"\", Emerson referred to Very:\nThe last decades of Very's life were spent in Salem as a recluse under the care of his sister. It was during these years that he held roles as a visiting minister in Eastport, Maine and North Beverly, Massachusetts, though these roles were temporary because he had become too shy. By age 45, he had retired. In his last forty years, Very did very little. As biographer Edwin Gittleman wrote, \"Although he lived until 1880, Very's effective life was over by the end of 1840.\" He died on May 8, 1880 and, upon hearing of Very's death, Alcott wrote a brief remembrance on May 16, 1880:\nThe first critical review of Very's book was written by Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's \"Boston Quarterly Review\"; it said Very's poems had \"an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity\", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the \"sing song\" style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: \"I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known.\" James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the \"Western Messenger\", between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity \"is only superficial\". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: \"The thought is deeply spiritual; and while there is a certain character of \"peculiarity\" which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where you would... find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets.\"\n\nEditor and critic Rufus Wilmot Griswold was impressed enough by Very's poetry to include him in the first edition of his anthology \"The Poets and Poetry of America\" in 1842. He wrote to Emerson asking for more information about him and expressing his opinion of his poetry: \"Though comparatively unknown, he seems to be a true poet.\"\n\nThe modern reassessment of Jones Very as an author of literary importance can be dated to a 1936 essay by Yvor Winters who wrote of the poet, “In the past two decades two major American writers have been rediscovered and established securely in their rightful places in literary history. I refer to Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville. I am proposing the establishment of a third.” Winters, in speaking of Very’s relations with Emerson and his circle, concluded, “The attitude of the Transcendentalists toward Very is instructive and amusing, and it proves beyond cavil how remote he was from them. In respect to the doctrine of the submission of the will, he agreed with them in principle; but whereas they recommended the surrender, he practised it, and they regarded him with amazement.” Subsequently, William Irving Bartlett, in 1942, outlined the basic biographical facts of Very’s life in \"Jones Very, Emerson’s “Brave Saint.”\" A complete scholarly edition of Very’s poetic works belatedly appeared, over a century after the poet’s death, in 1993.\n\n\n"}

He is also credited for developing a theory of causal and counterfactual inference based on structural models (see article on causality). He is the 2011 winner of the ACM Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science, \"for fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning\".\n\nJudea Pearl is the father of journalist Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and murdered by militants in Pakistan connected with Al-Qaeda and the International Islamic Front in 2002 for his American and Jewish heritage.\n\nJudea Pearl was born in Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine, in 1936 to Polish-immigrant parents. He is a descendant of Menachem Mendel of Kotzk on his mother's side. After serving in the Israel Defense Forces and joining a kibbutz, Pearl decided to study engineering in 1956. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Technion 1960. That same year, he emigrated to the United States and pursued graduate studies. He received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Newark College of Engineering (now the New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1961, and went on to receive an M.S. in Physics from Rutgers University and a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the New York University Tandon School of Engineering) in 1965. He worked at RCA Research Laboratories on superconductive parametric amplifiers and storage devices and at Electronic Memories, Inc., on advanced memory systems. When semiconductors \"wiped out\" Pearl's work, as he later expressed it, he joined UCLA's School of Engineering in 1970 and started work on probabilistic artificial intelligence. He is one of the founding editors of the \"Journal of Causal Inference\".\n\nPearl is currently a professor of computer science and statistics and director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UCLA. He and his wife, Ruth, had three children. In addition, , he is a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.\n\nFormer Israeli Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, partnered with Judea Pearl in the documentary \"With My Whole Broken Heart\".\n\nIn 2002, his son, Daniel Pearl, a journalist working for the \"Wall Street Journal\" was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan, leading Judea and the other members of the family and friends to create the Daniel Pearl Foundation. On the seventh anniversary of Daniel's death, Judea wrote an article in the \"Wall Street Journal\" titled \"Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil: When will our luminaries stop making excuses for terror?\".\n\nEmeritus Chief Rabbi, The Right Honourable Lord Jonathan Sacks quoted Judea Pearl's beliefs in a lesson on Judaism. \"I asked Judea Pearl, father of the murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, why he was working for reconciliation between Jews and Muslims, he replied with heartbreaking lucidity, \"Hate killed my son. Therefore I am determined to fight hate.\"\n\nOn his religious views, Pearl states that he doesn't believe in God. He is very connected to Jewish traditions such as daily prayer, tefillin, and Kiddush on Friday night. In an interview with \"Heeb Magazine\", he is \"... trying to educate our children and live under God.\" He believes that Jews have always expected a return to Israel as expressed in songs, prayers and holidays.\n\nJudea Pearl was one of the pioneers of Bayesian networks and the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence, and one of the first to mathematize causal modeling in the empirical sciences. His work is also intended as a high-level cognitive model. He is interested in the philosophy of science, knowledge representation, nonstandard logics, and learning. Pearl is described as \"one of the giants in the field of artificial intelligence\" by UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf. His work on causality has \"revolutionized the understanding of causality in statistics, psychology, medicine and the social sciences\" according to the Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since that time he lives and works in and around Munich.\n\nAlready at the age of six in Sindh, Mahirwan Mamtani began to paint, mainly with charcoal and chalks on walls. At the age of 12, due to the partition of India, in 1947 the family moved to Delhi. Because of miserable living conditions as a refugee, lying on sick bed he taught himself without proper schooling. He used to doodle with pencil or pastels on paper. However circumstances forced Mamtani to earn money doing several jobs and his urge to paint was suppressed due to lack of time and money. After some years of such conditions, loneliness and hard work at self-education, Mamtani besides his jobs started studying for Bachelor of Arts and then joined evening classes at the Fine Arts Department of Delhi Polytechnic to study painting. He obtained the National Diploma in 1962. In 1966 he was awarded a scholarship by German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) to study painting at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich under Prof. . Since then he is living with his family in and around the Munich and Bavaria area.\n\nAlready at the beginning of his studies, Mamtani was aware of Kandinsky, one of the groundbreakers of modernism, who had been searching for spiritual dimensions in art. For Mamtani it can go as far back as William Blake in the 18th century or extend to a German contemporary like Joseph Beuys, who was influenced by the anthroposophic teachings of Rudolf Steiner.\n\nIn Munich, in the 1960s, he was influenced by Constructivism, and with his Indian background, by Tantra art. Out of these origins arose his \"Centrovision\" series, which – already in 1990 – consisted of more than 3000 works.\n\nSome of his earlier multimedia projects were graphic animation films: CENTROVISION (1981) and FACES (1982). \nStarting in 1990 he built upon an idea from earlier (1985) works, where he had begun to let faces appear in some of his artwork. He performed dances wearing several mandala masks, which he had painted on wood, and recorded these dances in the form of photos and videos with the help of a self-timer.\nHe then painted over the surface of the resulting photo sheets with acrylic colours, creating a series of new mixed-media works of art which he called \"Transmuted Fotos\". During that time he also experimented with other mixed media.\n\nFrom the year 2000 onwards, Mamtani created \"Mandala Conscious Beings\" where he focused on figurative paintings using mandala masks as central elements. This was driven by his urge to deal with human emotions (masks). His remarks were \"We all are constantly wearing masks. We are changing the masks, but not removing them.\"\n\nAround 2003, he also started working on earlier dance videos, recomposing them into new clips (some of them available on YouTube).\n\nIn India Mamtani is counted among the Neo-Tantra artists Biren De, G.R. Santosh, K. C. S. Paniker, Sohan Qadri, Proffula Mohanti, Haridasan, Om Prakash Sharma, P.T. Reddy, . The group exhibited in several museums in Germany, USA and Australia.\n\nIn Europe, Mamtani belongs to a group of artists THE SPIRITUAL IN ART – Domenico Caneschi, Italy – Pietro Gentili, Italy – , France – Joerg Anton Schulthess, Switzerland – Nora Ullmann, Israel. This group was initiated in the 1970s by Dr. Walter Schönenberger, the director of museum in Lugano, who organised several exhibitions in Locarno, Aarau, Milano and Bochum.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1535899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1535899", "title": "Miyabi", "text": "Miyabi\n\nMiyabi (雅) is one of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though not as prevalent as Iki or Wabi-sabi. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as \"elegance,\" \"refinement,\" or \"courtliness\" and sometimes to a \"sweet loved one\".\n\nThe ideal posed by the word demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the \"polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace.\" It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the Heian era. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of Mono no aware, a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi. An example of this would be one of a lone cherry tree. The tree would soon lose its flowers and would be stripped of everything that made it beautiful and so it showed not only mono no aware, but also miyabi in the process.\n\nAdherents to the ideals of miyabi strove to rid the world of crude forms or aesthetics and emotions that were common in artworks of the period, such as those contained in the Man'yōshū, the oldest extant collection of Japanese poetry. The Man'yōshū contained poems by people of every walk of life, many of which stood in stark contrast to the sensibilities of miyabi. For example, one poem in the collection likened a woman's hair to snail innards. The ideals of miyabi stood firmly against the use of metaphors such as this. Furthermore, appreciation of miyabi and its ideal was used as a marker of class differences. It was believed that only members of the upper class, the courtiers, could truly appreciate the workings of miyabi.\n\nMiyabi in fact limited how art and poems could be created. Miyabi tried to stay away from the rustic and crude, and in doing so, prevented the traditionally trained courtiers from expressing real feelings in their works. In later years, miyabi and its aesthetic were replaced by ideals inspired by Zen Buddhism, such as Wabi-sabi, Yuugen and Iki.\n\nThe characters of the classic eleventh-century Japanese novel \"The Tale of Genji\" by Lady Murasaki provide examples of miyabi.\n"}

NAISN will also begin to track invasive species expenditures through annual surveys of federal, provincial, state, municipal and tribal governments and oversee a comprehensive analysis of economic impacts of invasive species; such information could readily be used by policy-makers and elected officials. Finally, NAISN will provide a single source for the news media and develop and implement national public awareness campaigns about invasive species.\n\n\n"}

Incorporating dimensions of positive and negative numbers and exponents, or expanding x, y and z coordinates, by adding a fourth dimension of time allows a resolution of position relative to the standard of the scale which is often taken as 0,0,0,0 with additional dimensions added as referential scales are expanded from space and time to mass and energy.\n\nAncient systems frequently scaled their degree of opposition by rate of increase or rate of decrease. Linear increase was enhanced by doubling systems. An acceleration in the rate of increase or decrease could be analyzed arithmetrically, geometrically, or through a wide range of other numerical and physical analysis. Arithmetic and geometric series, and other methods of rating proportionate expansion or contraction could be thought of as convergent or divergent toward a position.\n\nThough unit quantities were first defined by spatial dimensions, and then expanded by adding coordinates of time, the weight or mass a given spatial dimension could contain was also considered and even in antiquity, conditions under which the standard would be established such as at a given temperature, distance from sea level, or density were added.\n\nRates of change over time were then considered as either indexes of production or depletion\n\nPaired opposites are used as poetic diction meaning \"everything\". Common phrases incorporated paired opposites in English include \"all creatures great and small,\" \"working for the man every night and day,\" \"more things in heaven and Earth\" \"searching high and low\" \"in sickness and in health\". In Greek literature, Homer uses the device when he lets Telemachus say, \"I know all things, the good and the evil\" (Od.20:309-10).\nThe same phrase is used in Hebrew in text of Genesis, referring to the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, as well as some fields of mathematics, conjugate variables are a form of paired opposites, in which knowledge of one precludes knowledge of the other. A standard example is the relation between position (x) and momentum (p), which can be expressed in terms of the uncertainty principle as formula_1.\n"}
{"id": "7802146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7802146", "title": "Phenomenology (psychology)", "text": "Phenomenology (psychology)\n\nPhenomenology within psychology (phenomenological psychology) is the psychological study of subjective experience. It is an approach to psychological subject matter that has its roots in the philosophical work of Edmund Husserl. Early phenomenologists such as Husserl, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty conducted philosophical investigations of consciousness in the early 20th century. Their critiques of psychologism and positivism later influenced at least two main fields of contemporary psychology: the phenomenological psychological approach of the Duquesne School (The Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology), including Amedeo Giorgi and Frederick Wertz; and the experimental approaches associated with Francisco Varela, Shaun Gallagher, Evan Thompson, and others (embodied mind thesis). Other names associated with the movement include Jonathan Smith (interpretative phenomenological analysis), Steinar Kvale, and Wolfgang Köhler. But \"an even stronger influence on psychopathology came from Heidegger (1963), particularly through Kunz (1931), Blankenburg (1971), Tellenbach (1983), Binswanger (1994), and others.\" Phenomenological psychologists have also figured prominently in the history of the humanistic psychology movement.\n\nThe experiencing subject can be considered to be the person or self, for purposes of convenience. In phenomenological philosophy (and in particular in the work of Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty), \"experience\" is a considerably more complex concept than it is usually taken to be in everyday use. Instead, experience (or being, or existence itself) is an \"in-relation-to\" phenomenon, and it is defined by qualities of directedness, embodiment, and worldliness, which are evoked by the term \"Being-in-the-World\".\n\nThe quality or nature of a given experience is often referred to by the term qualia, whose archetypical exemplar is \"redness\". For example, we might ask, \"Is my experience of redness the same as yours?\" While it is difficult to answer such a question in any concrete way, the concept of intersubjectivity is often used as a mechanism for understanding how it is that humans are able to empathise with one another's experiences, and indeed to engage in meaningful communication about them. The phenomenological formulation of Being-in-the-World, where person and world are mutually constitutive, is central here.\n\nThe philosophical psychology prevalent before the end of the 19th century relied heavily on introspection. The speculations concerning the mind based on those observations were criticized by the pioneering advocates of a more scientific approach to psychology, such as William James and the behaviorists Edward Thorndike, Clark Hull, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner. However, not everyone agrees that introspection is intrinsically problematic, such as Francisco Varela, who has trained experimental participants in the structured \"introspection\" of phenomenological reduction.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Amedeo Giorgi applied phenomenological theory to his development of the Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology in order to overcome certain problems he perceived, from his work in psychophysics, with approaching subjective phenomena from the traditional hypothetical-deductive framework of the natural sciences. Giorgi hoped to use what he had learned from his natural science background to develop a rigorous qualitative research method. Giorgi has thus described his overall project as such: \"[Phenomenological psychology] is nothing like natural sciences... because its [sic] [dealing with] human experiences and human phenomena. [However] I want to be sure that our criteria is this: that every natural scientist will have to respect our method. I'm not just trying to satisfy clinicians, or therapists, or humanists, I'm trying to satisfy the most severe criterion—natural scientists... because I anticipate that some day, when qualitative research develops and gets strong, the natural science people are going to criticize it. And I want to be able to stand up and say, 'Go ahead, criticize it—but you won't find any flaws here'.\"\n\nPhilosophers have long confronted the problem of \"qualia\". Few philosophers believe that it is possible to be sure that one person's experience of the \"redness\" of an object is the same as another person's, even if both persons had effectively identical genetic and experiential histories. In principle, the same difficulty arises in feelings (the subjective experience of emotion), in the experience of effort, and especially in the \"meaning\" of concepts. As a result, many qualitative psychologists have claimed phenomenological inquiry to be essentially a matter of \"meaning-making\" and thus a question to be addressed by interpretive approaches.\n\nCarl Rogers' person-centered psychotherapy theory is based directly on the \"phenomenal field\" personality theory of Combs and Snygg. That theory in turn was grounded in phenomenological thinking. Rogers attempts to put a therapist in closer contact with a person by listening to the person's report of their recent subjective experiences, especially emotions of which the person is not fully aware. For example, in relationships the problem at hand is often not based around what actually happened but, instead, based around the perceptions and feelings of each individual in the relationship. The phenomenal field focuses on \"how one feels right now\".\n\n"}
{"id": "24696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24696", "title": "Prima facie", "text": "Prima facie\n\nPrima facie (; ) is a Latin expression meaning \"on its first encounter\" or \"at first sight\". The literal translation would be \"at first face\" or \"at first appearance\", from the feminine forms of \"primus\" (\"first\") and \"facies\" (\"face\"), both in the ablative case. In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be \"on the face of it\". The term \"prima facie\" is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, \"prima facie\" denotes evidence that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy. Most legal proceedings, in most jurisdictions, require a \"prima facie\" case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.\n\nIn most legal proceedings, one party has a burden of proof, which requires it to present \"prima facie\" evidence for all of the essential facts in its case. If it cannot, its claim may be dismissed without any need for a response by other parties. A \"prima facie\" case might not stand or fall on its own; if an opposing party introduces other evidence or asserts an affirmative defense it can only be reconciled with a full trial. Sometimes the introduction of \"prima facie\" evidence is informally called \"making a case\" or \"building a case\".\n\nFor example, in a trial under criminal law the prosecution has the burden of presenting \"prima facie\" evidence of each element of the crime charged against the defendant. In a murder case, this would include evidence that the victim was in fact dead, that the defendant's act caused the death, and evidence that the defendant acted with malice aforethought. If no party introduces new evidence, the case stands or falls just by the \"prima facie\" evidence or lack thereof.\n\n\"Prima facie\" evidence does not need to be conclusive or irrefutable: at this stage, evidence rebutting the case is not considered, only whether any party's case has enough merit to take it to a full trial.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the prosecution in a criminal trial must disclose all evidence to the defense. This includes the \"prima facie\" evidence.\n\nAn aim of the doctrine of \"prima facie\" is to prevent litigants from bringing spurious charges which simply waste all other parties' time.\n\n\"Prima facie\" is often confused with \"res ipsa loquitur\" (\"the thing speaks for itself\", or literally \"the thing itself speaks\"), the common law doctrine that when the facts make it self-evident that negligence or other responsibility lies with a party, it is not necessary to provide extraneous details, since any reasonable person would immediately find the facts of the case.\n\nThe difference between the two is that \"prima facie\" is a term meaning there is enough evidence for there to be a case to answer, while \"Res ipsa loquitur\" means that the facts are so obvious a party does not need to explain any more. For example: \"There is a \"prima facie\" case that the defendant is liable. They controlled the pump. The pump was left on and flooded the plaintiff's house. The plaintiff was away and had left the house in the control of the defendant. \"Res ipsa loquitur\".\"\n\nThis doctrine has been subsumed by general negligence law in Canadian tort law.\n\nThe phrase is also used in academic philosophy. Among its most notable uses is in the theory of ethics first proposed by W. D. Ross, often called the \"Ethic of Prima Facie Duties\", as well as in epistemology, as used, for example, by Robert Audi. It is generally used in reference to an obligation. \"I have a \"prima facie\" obligation to keep my promise and meet my friend\" means that I am under an obligation, but this may yield to a more pressing duty. A more modern usage prefers the title \"pro tanto obligation\": an obligation that may be later overruled by another more pressing one; it exists only \"pro tempore\".\n\nThe phrase \"prima facie\" is sometimes misspelled ' in the mistaken belief that ' is the actual Latin word; however, \"faciē\" is in fact the ablative case of \"faciēs\", a fifth declension Latin noun.\n\nIn policy debate theory, \"prima facie\" is used to describe the mandates or planks of an affirmative case, or, in some rare cases, a negative counterplan. When the negative team appeals to \"prima facie\", it appeals to the fact that the affirmative team cannot add or amend anything in its plan after being stated in the first affirmative constructive.\n\nA common usage of the phrase is the concept of a \"\"prima facie\" speed limit\", which has been used in Australia and the United States. A \"prima facie\" speed limit is a default speed limit that applies when no other specific speed limit is posted, and may be exceeded by a driver. However, if the driver is detected, and cited by police for exceeding the limit, the onus of proof is on the driver, to show that the speed at which the driver was travelling was safe under the circumstances. In most jurisdictions, this type of speed limit has been replaced by absolute speed limits.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "332764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332764", "title": "Richard Jefferies", "text": "Richard Jefferies\n\nJohn Richard Jefferies (6 November 1848 – 14 August 1887) was an English nature writer, noted for his depiction of English rural life in essays, books of natural history, and novels. His childhood on a small Wiltshire farm had a great influence on him and provides the background to all his major works of fiction.\n\nJefferies's corpus of writings includes a diversity of genres and topics, including \"Bevis\" (1882), a classic children's book, and \"After London\" (1885), an early work of science fiction. For much of his adult life, he suffered from tuberculosis, and his struggles with the illness and with poverty also play a role in his writing. Jefferies valued and cultivated an intensity of feeling in his experience of the world around him, a cultivation that he describes in detail in \"The Story of My Heart\" (1883). This work, an introspective depiction of his thoughts and feelings on the world, gained him the reputation of a nature mystic at the time. But it is his success in conveying his awareness of nature and people within it, both in his fiction and in essay collections such as \"The Amateur Poacher\" (1879) and \"Round About a Great Estate\" (1880), that has drawn most admirers. Walter Besant wrote of his reaction on first reading Jefferies: \"Why, we must have been blind all our lives; here were the most wonderful things possible going on under our very noses, but we saw them not.\"\n\nJohn Richard Jefferies (he used the first name only during his childhood) was born at Coate, in the parish of Chiseldon, near Swindon, Wiltshire, the son of a farmer, James Luckett Jefferies (1816–1896). His birthplace and home is now a museum open to the public. James Jefferies had the farm from his father, John Jefferies, who had been a London printer before returning to Swindon to run the family mill and bakery. Richard's mother, Elizabeth Gyde (1817–1895), always called Betsy, was the daughter of John Jefferies's binder and manager.\n\nThese relationships are mirrored in the characters of Jefferies's late novel \"Amaryllis at the Fair\" (1887); and the portraits of the family in the novel tally with external accounts of the Jefferies. James Jefferies, like Iden in \"Amaryllis\", was devoted to his garden, while struggling to make a financial success of the farm. The garden, lovingly recalled in \"Wood Magic\" and \"Amaryllis\", also makes a strong impression on the memories of those who knew the Jefferies at the time. Betsy, like Iden's wife, seems to have been dissatisfied with life on the farm: \"a town-bred woman with a beautiful face and a pleasure-loving soul, kind and generous to a fault, but unsuited to a country life.\" The farm was very small, with of pasture; and a mortgage of £1500 would later begin a slide into debt for James Jefferies, who lost the farm in 1877 and became a jobbing gardener. But these difficulties were less evident in Richard's childhood. The situation was much as in \"After London\" (1885), where the farming and gardening Baron is again based on James Jefferies: \"The whole place was thus falling to decay, while at the same time it seemed to be flowing with milk and honey\". One part of the Jefferies family is strikingly missing from the books. In \"Wood Magic\", \"Bevis\" and \"Amaryllis\", the hero (or heroine) has no siblings; only \"After London\" gives the main character brothers and depicts the imperfect sympathy between them. James and Elizabeth's first child, Ellen, had died young; but Richard had two younger brothers and a younger sister.\n\nJefferies spent several of his earlier years, between the ages of four and nine, with his aunt and uncle, the Harrilds, in Sydenham, where he attended a private school, returning to Coate in the holidays. His uncle, Thomas Harrild, was a son of the printing innovator Robert Harrild. Jefferies kept a close friendship with Mrs. Ellen Harrild (nee Gyde) and his letters to her are an important source for biographers. At Coate, he spent most of his time in the countryside; and much of what he narrates of Bevis is true of himself. His father had taken him shooting when he was eight; and already at nine he had shot a rabbit. He was soon spending much of his time hunting (both with a gun and with snares) and fishing. He also, like Bevis, added home-made rigging to a boat to sail on the reservoir; and he is said to have built his own canoe, like the hero of \"After London\". At the same time, he became a keen reader: favourite books included Homer's \"Odyssey\", Percy's \"Reliques\", \"Don Quixote\" and James Fenimore Cooper's \"The Pathfinder\", which served as a model for mock battles fought on a field between the farm and the reservoir.\n\nIn November 1864, at the age of sixteen, he and a cousin, James Cox, ran off to France, intending to walk to Russia. (Cox, slightly older than Jefferies, worked for the Great Western Railway and had a little money saved.) After crossing the channel, they soon found that their schoolboy French was insufficient and returned to England. Before they reached Swindon, they noticed an advertisement for cheap crossings from Liverpool to America and set off in this new direction. The tickets however, did not include the cost of food; and the boys were forced to return to Swindon after an attempt to pawn their watches had drawn the attention of the police.\n\nJefferies left school at fifteen and at first continued his habits of solitary wanderings about the local countryside. He dressed carelessly and allowed his hair to grow down to his collar. This, with his \"bent form and long, rapid stride made him an object of wonder in the town of Swindon. But he was perfectly unconscious of this, or indifferent to it.\" He helped little on the farm (his only enthusiasm was for chopping and splitting wood) and was regarded as something of an idler. The gun that he always carried drew the suspicion of local landowners – one said, \"That young Jefferies is not the sort of fellow you want hanging about in your covers\". Finally, early in 1866, he started work as a newspaper reporter for the \"North Wiltshire Herald\". For several years he worked as a reporter, contributing not only to the \"North Wiltshire Herald\", but also to the \"Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard\" and to the \"Swindon Advertiser\". The editor of the \"Swindon Advertiser\", William Morris, an antiquarian and local historian, lent Jefferies books and encouraged his early writing attempts. Jefferies himself developed an antiquarian interest in the countryside: he published articles on local history in the \"North Wiltshire Herald\" and was the first to notice a stone circle near Coate Farm. He was also spending much time on the downs, particularly at the iron age hill fort, Liddington Castle, where he would lie on the grass, ecstatically feeling and seeking a connection with the natural world. In September 1867 and July 1868 he was very ill. In retrospect the illnesses were clearly the first symptoms of the tuberculosis that would kill him. He emerged from them weakened and very thin – \"My legs are as thin as a grasshopper's\", he wrote to his aunt. Illness also prompted some reconsideration of his own character: he was going to be \"not swell but stylish\" in future, since people set so much store by appearance.\n\nHe was now actively pursuing a career as a writer, writing a history of the Goddards, a local family, and \"Reporting, Editing, and Authorship: Practical Hints for Beginners in Literature\" (1873), in which he shared the fruits of his brief experience as a local reporter. Meanwhile the novels he was writing could not find a publisher. What national attention he attracted was instead from a series of letters to \"The Times\" on the Wiltshire agricultural labourer, published in November 1872. The letters, like his other writings from this period, reflect the Conservative outlook of his upbringing.\n\nIn 1874, the year of his first published novel, \"The Scarlet Shawl\", he married Jessie Baden (1853–1926), the daughter of a nearby farmer. After living for a few months at Coate Farm, the couple moved to a house in Swindon in 1875 (its current address is 93 Victoria Road); and their first child, Richard Harold Jefferies, was born there on 3 May.\n\nWhile in Swindon, Jefferies had found it difficult to seek publication or employment with London publishers; and early in 1877, with Jessie and their baby son Harold, he moved to a house at what is now 296 Ewell Road, Tolworth, near Surbiton. (There is a wooden plaque commemorating this by the entrance to Surbiton Library.) The area was then at the limits of London's growth. Jefferies spent much time wandering through the nearby countryside; and these walks would later provide the material for \"Nature Near London\" (1883).\nThe Surbiton years were momentous. The couple's next child, a daughter called Jessie after her mother (but known by her second name, Phyllis), was born (on 6 December 1880), and Jefferies began to make his name at last. His new surroundings defined him, both to himself and others, as a country writer. Articles drawing on Jefferies's Wiltshire experiences found a ready market in \"The Pall Mall Gazette\". First came a series of essays based on his friendship with the keeper of the Burderop estate, near Coate, \"The Gamekeeper at Home\", collected as a book in 1878. The book was well received and Jefferies was compared with the great English nature writer, Gilbert White. Three more collections followed the same pattern of publication in \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" and then in book form: \"Wild Life in a Southern County\" and \"The Amateur Poacher\" (both 1879), and \"Round About a Great Estate\" (1880). Another collection, \"Hodge and his Masters\" (1880), brought together articles first published in the \"Standard\". In the few years that Jefferies took to write these essays, his literary skill developed rapidly: \"The Amateur Poacher\" in particular is regarded as a major advance on the earlier works, the first in which he approaches the autobiographical subject matter that is behind his best works. A minor novel, \"Greene Ferne Farm\" (1880), was the first to gain recognition, both from contemporaries and in later scholarship.\n\nTwo books of these years form a sequence. \"Wood Magic: A Fable\" (1881) introduces his child-hero, Bevis, a small child on a farm near a small lake, called the \"Longpond\", clearly Coate Farm and Coate Reservoir. Bevis's exploration of the garden and neighbouring fields brings him into contact with the country's birds and animals, who can speak to him, as can even inanimate parts of nature, such as the stream and the wind. Part of the book is a depiction of a small child's interaction with the natural world, but much is a cynical animal fable of a revolt against the magpie Kapchack, the local tyrant. In \"Bevis\" (1882), the boy is older, and the fantasy element, by which animals can talk, is quite absent. Rather, we have realistically related adventures of Bevis and his friend Mark, fighting a mock battle with other local children, rigging a boat and sailing to an island on the lake (which they call \"The New Sea\"), fishing and even shooting with a homemade gun.\n\nIn December 1881, Jefferies began to suffer from his until then undiagnosed tuberculosis, with an anal fistula. After a series of painful operations, he moved to West Brighton to convalesce. About this time he wrote his extraordinary autobiography, \"The Story of My Heart\" (1883). He had been planning this work for seventeen years and, in his words, it was \"absolutely and unflinchingly true\". It was not an autobiography of the events of his life, but an outpouring of his deepest thoughts and feelings.\n\nArticles about the Surbiton area were reprinted in the popular \"Nature Near London\" (1883), although the last chapters of the book refer to Beachy Head, Ditchling Beacon and other Sussex landmarks.\n\nIn Brighton, his third child, Richard Oliver Launcelot Jefferies, was born on 18 July 1883. But his life was to be a short one. Jefferies moved to Eltham, then in Kent, now a part of Greenwich, in June 1884, and here, early in 1885, the child died suddenly of meningitis. Jefferies was so affected that he could not attend the funeral.\n\nJefferies's next novel, \"After London\" (1885), can be seen as an early example of \"post-apocalyptic fiction\": after some sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature, and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life.\n\nThe book has two parts. The first, \"The Relapse into Barbarism\", is the account by some later historian of the fall of civilisation and its consequences, with a loving description of nature reclaiming England: fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, the hated London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland. The second part, \"Wild England\", is largely a straightforward adventure set many years later in the wild landscape and society (here too Jefferies was setting an example for the genre); but the opening section, despite some improbabilities, has been much admired for its rigour and compelling narrative.\n\nCritics dissatisfied with the second part often make an exception of chapters 22–24, which go beyond recreation of a medieval world to give a disturbing and surreal description of the site of the fallen city.\n\nJefferies's interest in catastrophes predates \"After London\": two short unpublished pieces from the 1870s describe social collapse after London is paralysed by freak winter conditions. In the better achieved of these, the narrator is a future historian piecing the story together from surviving accounts. The fantasy of the second part also has a predecessor in a short work, \"The Rise of Maximin, Emperor of the Occident\", serialised in \"The New Monthly Magazine\" in 1876, in this case an adventure set in a remote and imaginary past.\n\nAlthough the society that Jefferies depicts after the fall of London is an unpleasant one, with oppressive petty tyrants at war with each other, and insecurity and injustice for the poor, it still served as an inspiration for William Morris's utopian \"News from Nowhere\" (1890). In a letter of 1885, he writes of his reaction to \"After London\": \"absurd hopes curled around my heart as I read it.\" \"After London\" also influenced M.P. Shiel's post-apocalyptic novel,\n\"The Purple Cloud\".\n\nAfter Eltham, Jefferies lived briefly in various parts of Sussex, first at Rotherfield, then in a house on Crowborough Hill. In Crowborough Jefferies completed his most ambitious and most unusual novel, \"Amaryllis at the Fair\" (1887). Closely based on his own family at Coate, it describes a farm and family imperceptibly approaching disaster. There is little narrative development; instead significant or typical moments are presented in short scenes or even tableaux.\n\nIllness and resulting lower productivity had impoverished Jefferies; and the editor Charles Longman suggested an application to the Royal Literary Fund. At first Jefferies resisted the suggestion, regarding aid from aristocratic patrons not involved in literary work humiliating: \"Patrons of literature! was there ever such a disgrace in the nineteenth century? Patrons of literature! The thing is simply abominable!\" Longman finally succeeded in convincing Jefferies that the fund was \"assisted by everybody who had made any success in literature\". An application was accepted and the committee voted a grant of one hundred pounds. Another fund arranged by Longman enabled Jefferies to move nearer to the sea, to the Worthing suburb of Goring. Here, on 14 August 1887, he died of tuberculosis and exhaustion. He is buried in Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery in Worthing.\n\nAfter his death, a number of posthumous collections were made of his writings previously published in newspapers and magazines, beginning with \"Field and Hedgerow\" (1889), edited by his widow. New collections have appeared over the century following his birth, but even now not all have been reprinted in book form.\n\nEarly works included three by Henry Stephens Salt:\n\nJefferies's works inspired Henry Williamson to take up writing ; Williamson edited a collection of Jefferies's writings with a title that indicates the great regard that he held for Jefferies:\n\nOther writers who admired Jefferies included David Garnett, Edward Thomas (who wrote his biography), Leslie Paul, Ethel Mannin,\nand Ludovic Kennedy.\n\nCanadian poet John Newlove published \"Inscription to Richard Jefferies on a Sarsen at Barbury\" in \"The Tasmanian Devil & Other Poems\".\n\nThe Richard Jefferies Bird Sanctuary in Surbiton commemorates him.\n\nThe following list is necessarily selective. Much of Jefferies's writing was not published in book form in his lifetime. Many works surviving in manuscript or only published in journals have been published piecemeal by various editors since his death. Since his contributions to journals were generally anonymous, identification is often a problem. For a fuller survey, see Miller and Matthews (1993).\n\n\nOnly the first of these (produced by his widow) was planned by Jefferies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47431129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47431129", "title": "Somaesthetics", "text": "Somaesthetics\n\nSomaesthetics is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry aimed at promoting and integrating the theoretical, empirical and practical disciplines related to bodily perception, performance and presentation.\n\nThe term ‘somaesthetics’ was coined by the American pragmatist philosopher Richard Shusterman in 1996 through the compounding of “soma”, an expression derived from the Greek word for body, and “aesthetics”, a word derived from the Greek \"aesthesis\", meaning ‘sensory perception’. Shusterman has reported in a number of his works that he chose ‘soma’ over more familiar terms “to avoid problematic associations of body (which can be a lifeless, mindless thing) and flesh (which designates only the fleshly parts of the body and is strongly associated with Christian notions of sin)” and to emphasize that the project “concerns the lived, sentient, purposive body rather than merely a physical body”. As an amalgamation, ‘somaesthetics’ “implies a project of appreciating and cultivating the body not only as an object that externally displays beauty, sublimity, grace, and other aesthetic qualities, but also as a subjectivity that perceives these qualities and that experiences attendant aesthetic pleasures somatically”.\n\nSomaesthetics as a research project initially arose from the work of Richard Shusterman during the mid-1990s in response to what he perceived as needed developments within his two principal modes of inquiry: pragmatist aesthetics and philosophy as an embodied art of living. While pragmatist aesthetics, according to Shusterman, advocates for more active and creative engagement than traditional aesthetics, he believed it should also recognize that artistic, practical and political action requires humanity’s primary tool, the body, and that such action could be improved partly by improving this instrument. In the same way, the philosophical life could be improved through greater mastery of the soma -- our medium of living. He moreover lamented the reduction of aesthetics (as well as philosophy itself) from “a noble art of living into a minor, specialized university discipline” narrowly concerned with beauty and fine art. Shusterman thus argued for the revival of “Baumgarten’s idea of aesthetics as a life-improving cognitive discipline that extends far beyond questions of beauty and fine arts and that involves both theory and practical exercise” and for an end to “the neglect of the body that Baumgarten disastrously introduced into aesthetics”. As proposed, Shusterman’s project of somaesthetics would restore “the soma — the living, sentient, purposive body — as the indispensable medium for all perception\". Such heightening of somatic consciousness would not only enhance artistic appreciation and creation, but increase the perceptual awareness of meanings and feelings that have the potential to elevate everyday experience into an art of living.\n\nShusterman proposed three fundamental dimensions of his emerging field:\n\n• Analytic somaesthetics, as the most theoretically-oriented of the three, “describes the basic nature of bodily perceptions and practices and also of their function in our knowledge and construction of reality”.\n\n• Pragmatic somaesthetics presupposes the analytic dimension and “has a distinctly normative, prescriptive character – by proposing specific methods of somatic improvement and engaging in their comparative critique”.\n\n• Practical somaesthetics focuses on practicing somatic care “through intelligently disciplined body work aimed at somatic self-improvement (whether in a representational, experiential, or performative mode)\".\n\nOver the past two decades, somaesthetics has become a truly interdisciplinary endeavor. Originally conceived by Shusterman as being under the umbrella of philosophy, or perhaps even a branch of aesthetics, somaesthetics has evolved into an “open field for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transcultural inquiry” with applications “ranging from the arts, product design, and politics to fashion, health, sports, martial arts, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs in education”.\n\n• Heyes, Cressida J. \"Self transformations: Foucault, Ethics, and Normalized Bodies\".

Strong first published his \"Concordance\" in 1890, while professor of exegetical theology at Drew Theological Seminary.\n\nThe purpose of \"Strong's Concordance\" is not to provide content or commentary about the Bible, but to provide an index to the Bible. This allows the reader to find words where they appear in the Bible. This index allows a student of the Bible to re-find a phrase or passage previously studied. It also lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used elsewhere in the Bible. In this way Strong provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of text.\n\nEach original-language word is given an entry number in the dictionary of those original language words listed in the back of the concordance. These have become known as the \"Strong's numbers\". The main concordance lists each word that appears in the KJV Bible in alphabetical order with each verse in which it appears listed in order of its appearance in the Bible, with a snippet of the surrounding text (including the word in italics). Appearing to the right of the scripture reference is the Strong's number. This allows the user of the concordance to look up the meaning of the original language word in the associated dictionary in the back, thereby showing how the original language word was translated into the English word in the KJV Bible.\n\n\"Strong's Concordance\" includes:\n\nNew editions of \"Strong's\" may exclude the comparative section (1611 KJV to 1614) and the asterisks that denote differential definitions of the same Hebrew or Greek words; due perhaps to denominational considerations, definitions may also be altered..\n\nAlthough the Greek words in \"Strong's Concordance\" are numbered 1–5624, the numbers 2717 and 3203–3302 are unassigned due to \"changes in the enumeration while in progress\". Not every distinct word is assigned a number, but only the root words. For example, αγαπησεις is assigned the same number as αγαπατε – both are listed as αγαπαω.\n\nOther authors have used Strong's numbers in concordances of other Bible translations, such as the \"New International Version\" and \"American Standard Version\".\n\nDue to Strong's numbers it became possible to translate concordances from one language into another. Thus, the Russian concordance of 30,000 words from the Russian Thompson Study Bible (\"Новая учебная Библия Томпсона\", La Buona Novella Inc, 2010, edition made by Christian society \"The Bible for everyone\", St.Petersburg, Russia) is a translation of the English concordance from Thompson Chain-Reference Bible (\"The New Thompson Study Bible,\" La Buona Novella Inc. & B.B.Kirkbride Bible Company, Inc., 2006). In the process of compiling the Russian concordance, the Hebrew/Greek word corresponding to the English concordance word was found, and then its Russian equivalent in the Russian Synodal translation of the Bible was added to the resulting Russian concordance text.\n\nNew editions of \"Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible\" remain in print .\n\nIn the 1890 version, Strong added a \"Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary\" and a \"Greek Dictionary of the New Testament\" to his concordance. In the preface to both dictionaries, Strong explains that these are \"brief and simple\" dictionaries, not meant to replace reference to \"a more copious and elaborate Lexicon.\" He mentions Gesenius and Fürst as examples of the lexicons that Strong's is drawn from. His dictionaries were meant to give students a quick and simple way to look up words and have a general idea of their meaning.\n\nStrong reportedly based his lexicons on the work of contemporary scholars such as Gesenius, Fürst, Liddell & Scott, Thayer, and Brown, Driver, and Briggs. According to the preface, he and his team also made \"numerous original suggestions, relations, and distinctions... especially in the affinities of roots and the classification of meanings.\" The work is intended to represent the best of 19th century scholarship, and both a simplification of it and an improvement on it. An important feature of Strong's dictionaries is the listing of every translation of a source word in the AV (King James) after the definition itself.\n\nIt is important to note Strong's association with the committee working on the American Revised Version of the Bible. His work does not tend to support the authority of the King James Version. He was part of the effort to update and replace it with what the translators believed would be a better version. As a result, he contributed deeper and more thorough study of Biblical languages, especially etymology, but also an inherently suspicious attitude toward the Textus Receptus, the King James, and toward traditional, less \"secular\" definitions of original words. The translation committee was associated with the Higher Critical movement and with the Westcott-Hort version of the Greek text. Strong, a Methodist layman and college professor, was acceptable to the committee, but one cannot assume he shared all of its views.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "327587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327587", "title": "Synderesis", "text": "Synderesis\n\nSynderesis or synteresis, in scholastic moral philosophy, is the natural \"capacity\" or disposition (habitus) of the \"practical reason\" to apprehend intuitively the universal \"first principles\" of human \"action\".\n\nReason is a single faculty, but is called differently according to the end that it assigns to its search for truth; when its goal is the mere consideration (contemplation) of truth, it is called \"speculative reason\"; when it considers truth in view of action (praxis), it is called \"practical reason\". In both cases reason uses demonstration (syllogism) as its tool; it proceeds from the understanding of previously known truths (premises) to the statement of a proposition (conclusion) whose truth follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nHow does one know that those premises (and consequently their conclusion) are true? Because they are themselves conclusions of previous demonstrations. Although one could take back this process of demonstration of the truth of premises as far as we want, a regression ad infinitum would deprive the demonstrative chain of certitude. Consequently, it is necessary that the point of departure of human reasoning be some immediately knowable, i.e. self-evident, propositions called \"first principles\", whose truth is not, indeed cannot be grasped through demonstration, but only by intuition (noûs).\n\nThe habit or disposition that allows the speculative reason to apprehend intuitively the principles that preside over its discursive reasoning is called \"understanding of principles\" (intellectus principiorum). The principles of \"non contradiction\", of \"identity\" and of \"excluded middle\", all of which are ultimately based on the notion of \"being\", which is the first that our reason apprehends absolutely, are all examples of those principles.\n\nSimilarly, the capacity or disposition that allows the practical reason to apprehend intuitively the principles or laws that preside over its discursive reasoning regarding human action is called \"synderesis\". Just as \"being\" is the first notion apprehended absolutely, so also \"good\" is the first thing that is apprehended by the practical reason, since everything that acts does so for an end which possesses the quality of goodness. That is why the first principle or law of the practical reason is \"good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided\". Also the precepts of natural law can be considered object of synderesis insofar as all the things towards which the human being has a natural inclination are naturally apprehended by the intellect as good and therefore as objects to be pursued, and their opposites as evils to be avoided.\n\nSynderesis is the capacity not only to apprehend the first principles, but also to judge every step of the practical discourse in the light of those principles. But, as an intellectual disposition concerned with knowledge of the first principles of action, synderesis provides only the universal premise of the practical syllogism. Every human \"action\", however, is singular, contingent and takes place in particular circumstances. To complete the practical discourse and reach a conclusion regarding what has to be done \"hic et nunc\" [here and now] and what means are to be used, other capacities are necessary besides synderesis, and to actually effect the action other faculties are required besides reason. That is why the whole picture concerning human action includes powers, dispositions and acts such as conscience, desire, will, etc.\n\nThe origin of the notion of synderesis as presented here can be traced, on the one hand, to the Commentary on Ezechiel by Saint Jerome (A.D. 347–419), where \"syntéresin\" (συντήρησιν) is mentioned among the powers of the soul and is described as the spark of conscience (\"scintilla conscientiae\") and, on the other, to the interpretation of Jerome's text given, in the 13th century, by Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas in the light of Aristotelian psychology and ethics. The word \"synderesis\" is by most scholars reckoned to be a corruption of the Greek word for shared knowledge or conscience, \"syneidêsis\" (), the corruption appearing in the medieval manuscripts of Jerome's Commentary.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of synderesis was proposed by Bonaventure, who considered it as the natural inclination of the \"will\" towards moral good.\n\nThe term is found applied in psychiatric studies too, with particular reference to psychopathy.\n\n"}

Terms of endearment are used for a variety of reasons, such as parents addressing their children and lovers addressing each other.\n\nSuch words may not in their original use, bear any resemblance in meaning to the meaning attached when used as a term of endearment, for example calling a significant other \"pumpkin\". Some words are clearly derived from each other, such as \"sweetheart\" and \"sweetie\", while others bear no etymological resemblance, such as \"baby\", \"babe\", and \"cutie\". \"Honey\" has been documented as a term of endearment from at least the 14th century. \"Baby\" is first used in 1839 and \"sugar\" only appears as recently as 1930.\n\nEach term of endearment has its own connotations, which are highly dependent on the situation they are used in, such as tone of voice, body language, and social context. Saying \"Hey baby, you're looking good\" varies greatly from the use \"Baby, don't swim at the deep end of the pool!\" Certain terms can be perceived as offensive or patronizing, depending on the context and speaker.\n\nFeminists have complained that while 'terms of endearment are words used by close friends, families, and lovers...they are also used on women by perfect strangers...double standard' – because 'between strangers terms of endearment imply a judgment of incompetence on the part of the target'. Others have pointed out however that, in an informal setting like a pub, 'the use of terms of endearment here was a positive politeness strategy. A term like \"mate\", or \"sweetie\", shifts the focus of the request away from its imposition...toward the camaraderie existing between interlocutors'.\n\nTerms of endearment often 'make use of internal rhyme...[with] still current forms such as lovey-dovey, which appeared in 1819, and honey bunny', or of other duplications. Some such combinations seem nonsensical, odd, or too long, however, such as \"baby pie\" or \"love dear\", and are seldom used.\n\nTerms of endearment can lose their original meaning over the course of time: thus for example 'in the early twentieth century the word \"crumpet\" was used as a term of endearment by both sexes', before diminishing later into a 'term of objectification' for women.\n\nTerms of endearment are also used as a sort of \"significant other identity\".\n\n'French has all kinds of interesting terms of endearment, including a rather odd assortment of barnyard animals...[like] mon canard (my duck)' – something which may be compared to the British 'baby talk...duckie'.\n\nWhen proper names escape one, terms of endearment can always substitute, producing (as Lacan put it) the 'opacity of the ejaculations of love, when, lacking a signifier to name the object of its epithalamium, it employs the crudest trickery of the imaginary. \"I'll eat you up...Sweetie!\" \"You'll love it...Rat!\"'.\n\nEric Berne identified the marital game of \"Sweetheart\", where 'White makes a subtly derogatory remark about Mrs White, disguised as anecdote, and ends: \"Isn't that right, sweetheart?\" Mrs. White tends to agree...because it would seem surly to disagree with a man who calls one \"sweetheart\" in public'.\n\nBerne points out that 'the more tense the situation, and the closer the game is to exposure, the more bitterly is the word \"sweetheart\" enunciated'; while the wife's antithesis is either 'to reply: \"Yes, \"honey\"!\"' or to 'respond with a similar \"Sweetheart\" type anecdote about the husband, saying in effect, \"You have a dirty face too, dear\"'.\n\n\n\n"}

He is now remembered for his work in the field of natural magic.\n\nA Royalist clergyman from Brecon, Wales, Thomas was the twin brother of the poet Henry Vaughan, both being born at Newton, in the parish of St. Briget's, in 1621. He entered Jesus College, Oxford, in 1638, and remained there for a decade during the English Civil War.\n\nVaughan took part in the Battle of Rowton Heath in 1645. He became rector of the parish of Llansantffraed (St Bridget) Wales and took up medical studies, motivated by the lack of doctors in Wales. But in 1650, Vaughan was evicted from the parish because of his Royalist sympathies.\n\nVaughan later became involved with a plan of Robert Child to form a chemical club, with a laboratory and library, the main aim being to translate and collect chemical works. He married his wife Rebecca in 1651 and spent the next period of his life in London. His wife died in 1658.\n\nVaughan died at the house of Samuel Kem, at Albury, Oxfordshire.\n\nAlthough he did not practice medicine, Vaughan sought to apply his chemical skills to preparing medicines in the manner recommended by Paracelsus. He corresponded with Samuel Hartlib, who by 1650 was paying attention to Vaughan as author, and established a reputation with his book \"Anthroposophia Theomagica\", a magico-mystical work. Vaughan was the author of tracts published under the pseudonym Eugenius Philalethes, as is now generally agreed.\n\nVaughan was unusual amongst alchemists of the time in that he worked closely with his wife Rebecca Vaughan. He was a self-described member of the \"Society of Unknown Philosophers\", and was responsible for translating into English in 1652 the \"Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis\", an anonymous Rosicrucian manifesto first published in 1614 in Kassel.\n\nAllen G. Debus has written that a simple explanation of Vaughan's natural philosophy, in its mature form, is as the \"De occulta\" of Cornelius Agrippa, in an exposition coming via the views of Michael Sendivogius. As a writer in the school of Sendivogius, Vaughan follows Jacques de Nuisement and Andreas Orthelius. He placed himself in the tradition of the Rosicrucian reformers of education, and of Johannes Trithemius, his teacher Libanius Gallus, and Pelagius of Majorca, teacher of Libanius (of whom the last two are not known to have been real people apart from what Trithemius relates of them).\n\nAccording to some writers of catalogues of hermetic and alchemical treatises (such as John Ferguson, Denis Ian Duveen, Vinci Verginelli et al.), Thomas Vaughan could be the anonymous author of the treatise \"Reconditorium ac Reclusorium Opulentiae Sapientiaeque Numinis Mundi Magni, cui deditur in titulum CHYMICA VANNUS... Amstelodami... Anno 1666\", i. e. a mysterious masterpiece of the hermetic tradition..\n\nVaughan quarrelled in print with Henry More. Their pamphlet war petered out, but More returned to the subject of alchemists in \"Enthusiasmus Triumphatus\" (1656). Another critic of Vaughan was John Gaule.\n\nVaughan fell out with an alchemical collaborator, Edward Bolnest, over money matters and alleged broken promises, and the matter came to litigation after Bolnest had threatened violence. Vaughan was accused as part of this affair of spending \"most of his time in the study of Naturall Philosophy and Chimicall Phisick\". He is reported as having confessed that he had \"long sought and long missed... the philosopher's stone.\"\n"}

Vedanta literally means the \"end of the Vedas.\" \"VishishtAdvaita\" (literally \"Advaita with uniqueness; qualifications\") is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta philosophy. It is non-dualism of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as qualified monism or qualified non-dualism or attributive monism. It is a school of Vedanta philosophy which believes in all diversity subsuming to an underlying unity.\n\nRamanuja, the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the Prasthanatrayi (\"The three courses\"), namely the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma Sutras are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency. Vedanta Desika defines \"Vishishtadvaita\" using the statement, \"Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam :\" Brahman, as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality.\n\nThe Vishishtadvaitic thought is considered to have existed for a long time, and it is surmised that the earliest works are no longer available. The names of the earliest of these philosophers is only known through Ramanuja's \"Vedartha Sangraham\". Bodhayana, Dramida, Tanka, Guhadeva, Kapardi and Bharuci the prominent ones in the line of the philosophers considered to have expounded the VisishtAdvaitic system.\n\nBodhayana is considered to have written an extensive \"vritti\" (commentary) on the Purva and Uttara Mimamsas. Tanka is attributed with having written commentaries on Chandogya Upanishad and Brahma Sutras. Nathamuni of the ninth century AD, the foremost Acharya of the Vaishnavas, collected the Tamil prabandhas, classified them, made the redaction, set the hymns to music and spread them everywhere. He is said to have received the divine hymns straight from Nammalvar, the foremost of the twelve Alvars, by yogic insight in the temple at Alwar Thirunagari, which is located near Tirunelveli in South India. Yamunacharya renounced kingship and spent his last days in the service of the Lord at Srirangam and in laying the fundamentals of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy by writing four basic works on the subject.\n\nRamanuja is the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy. The philosophy itself is considered to have existed long before Ramanuja's time. Ramanuja continues along the line of thought of his predecessors while expounding the knowledge expressed in the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and Bhagavad Gita. Vedanta Desika and Pillai Lokacharya, disciples in the tradition of Ramanuja, had minor disagreements not on the philosophy, but on some aspects of the theology, giving rise to the Vadakalai and Thenkalai schools of thought, as explained below.\n\nSwaminarayan, the founder of Swaminarayan Hinduism, also propagated this philosophy and based the Swaminarayan Sampraday (original name is Uddhava Sampraday) on these ideals.\n\nThere are three key principles of Vishishtadvaita:\n\n\"Pramana\" refers to the correct knowledge, arrived at by thorough reasoning, of any object. \"Pramana\" (\"sources of knowledge\", Sanskrit) forms one part of a \"triputi\" (trio).\n\nIn Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, only the following three \"pramanas\" are accepted as valid means of knowledge:\n\nThere are three rules of hierarchy when there is apparent conflict between the three modes of acquiring knowledge:\n\nThe ontology in Vishishtadvaita consists of explaining the relationship between Ishvara (\"Parabrahman\"), the sentient beings (\"chit-brahman\") and the insentient Universe (\"achit-brahman\"). In the broadest sense, Ishvara is the Universal Soul of the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings. The three ontological entities are described below:\n\nIshvara (denoted by Vishnu-Narayana) is the Supreme Cosmic Spirit who maintains complete control over the Universe and all the sentient beings, which together also form the pan-organistic body of Ishvara. The triad of Ishvara along with the universe and the sentient beings is Brahman, which signifies the completeness of existence. Ishvara is Parabrahman endowed with innumerable auspicious qualities (Kalyana Gunas). Ishvara is perfect, omniscient, omnipresent, incorporeal, independent, the creator of the universe, its active ruler and also its eventual destroyer. He is causeless, eternal and unchangeable — and is yet the material and the efficient cause of the universe and sentient beings. He is both immanent (like whiteness in milk) and transcendent (like a watch-maker independent of a watch). He is the subject of worship. He is the basis of morality and giver of the fruits of one's Karma. He rules the world with His Maya — His divine power.\n\nIshvara is considered to have a 2-fold characteristic: he is the indweller of all beings and all beings dwell in Ishvara.\n\nWhen Ishvara is thought of as the indweller of all beings, he is referred to as the Paramatman, or the innermost self of all beings.\n\n\"He who inhabits water, yet is within water, whom water does not know, whose body water is and who controls water from within — He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.\"\n\n\"He who inhabits the sun, yet is within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is and who controls the sun from within — He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal\" - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.7.4-14\n\nWhen Ishvara is thought of as the all encomposing and the residence of all beings that is, all beings reside in Ishvara, he is referred to as the paramapurusha. The sentient beings and the insentient universe which form part of the pan-organistic body of Ishvara are encapsulated by Ishvara.\n\n\"Sarvam khalvidam Brahma\" Chandogya Upanishad\n\n\"Isavasyam idam sarvam\" Isha Upanishad\n\nChit is the world of sentient beings, or of entities possessing consciousness. It is similar to the Purusha of Samkhya system. The sentient beings are called Jīvās and they are possessors of individual consciousness as denoted by \"I\". The scope of Chit refers to all beings with an \"I\" consciousness, or more specifically self-awareness. Therefore, all entities which are aware of their own individual existence are denoted as \"chit\". This is called \"Dharmi-jnana\" or \"substantive consciousness\". The sentient beings also possess varying levels of \"Dharma-bhuta-jnana\" or \"attributive consciousness\"\n\nThe jivas possess three different types of existence:\n\nAchit is the world of insentient entities as denoted by matter or more specifically the non-conscious Universe. It is similar to the Prakriti of Samkhya system.\n\nThere is a subtle difference between Ishvara and Brahman. Ishvara is the substantive part of Brahman, while jivas and jagat are its modes (also secondary attributes), and kalyanagunas (auspicious attributes) are the primary attributes. The secondary attributes become manifested in the effect state when the world is differentiated by name and form. The kalyanagunas are eternally manifest.\n\n\"Brahman is the description of Ishvara when comprehended in fullness– i.e., a simultaneous vision of Ishvara with all his modes and attributes. \"\n\nThe relationship between Brahman and Jivas, Jagat is expressed by Rāmānujā in numerous ways. He calls this relationship as one of:\n\nThese relationships can be experienced holding Brahman as the father, son, mother, sister, wife, husband, friend, lover and lord. Hence, Brahman is a personal being.\n\nRamanuja argues vehemently against understanding Brahman as one without attributes. Brahman is Nirguna in the sense that impure qualities do not touch it. He provides three valid reasons for staking such a claim:\n\nShruti/ Shabda Pramana: All shrutis and shabdas denoting Brahman always list either attributes inherent to Brahman or not inherent to Brahman. The shrutis only seek to deny Brahman from possessing impure and defective qualities which affect the world of beings. There is evidence in the shrutis to this regard. The shrutis proclaim Brahman to be beyond the tri-gunas which are observed. However, Brahman possesses an infinite number of transcendental attributes, the evidence of which is given in vakhyas like \"satyam jnanam anantam Brahma\" (Taittiriya Upanishad).\n\nPratyaksha Pramana: Ramanuja states that \"a contentless cognition is impossible\". And all cognition must necessarily involve knowing Brahman through the attributes of Brahman.\n\nAnumana Pramana: Ramanuja states that \"Nirgunatva\" itself becomes an attribute of Brahman on account of the uniqueness of no other entity being Nirguna.\nRamanuja had simplified relationship between bramha and soul.According to him though soul is integral part of bramha it has independent existence.\n\nThe three ontological entities i.e. Ishvara, Chit and Achit are fundamentally real. It upholds the doctrine of \"Satkaryavada\" as against \"Asatkaryavada\".\n\nBriefly,\n\nMore specifically, the effect is a modification of what exists in the cause and does not involve new entities coming into existence. This is called as \"parinamavada\" or evolution of effect from the cause. This doctrine is common to the Samkhya system and Vishishtadvaita system. The Samkhya system adheres to Prakriti-Parinama vada whereas Vishishtadvaita is a modified form of Brahma-Parinama vada.\n\nThe (\"cause\") and (\"effect\") in Vishishtadvaita is different from other systems of Indian Philosophy. Brahman is both the (\"cause\") and the (\"effect\"). Brahman as the cause does not become the Universe as the effect.\n\nBrahman is assigned two (\"ways of being the cause\"):\n\n\nAccording to Vishishtadvaita, the Universe and Sentients always exist. However, they begin from a subtle state and undergo transformation. The subtle state is called a causal state, while the transformed state is called the effect state. The causal state is when Brahman is internally not distinguishable by name and form.\n\nIt can be said that Vishishtadvaita follows Brahma-Prakara-Parinama Vada. That is to say, it is the modes (Jivas and Jagath) of Brahman which is under evolution. The cause and effect only refer to the pan-organistic body transformation. Brahman as the Universal Self is unchanging and eternal.\n\nBrahman having the subtle (sūkshma) chit and achit entities as his \"Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)\" before manifestation is the same Brahman having the expanded (stūla) chit and achit entities as \"Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)\" after manifestation.\n\nThe essential feature is that the underlying entity is the same, the changes are in the description of that entity.\n\nFor e.g. \"Jack was a baby. Jack was a small kid. Jack was a middle-aged person. Jack was an old man. Jack is dead\"\n\nThe body of a single personality named Jack is described as continuously changing. Jack does not become \"James\" because of the change.\n\nSouls and Matter are only the body of God. Creation is a real act of God. It is the expansion of intelligence. Matter is fundamentally real and undergoes real revelation. The Soul is a higher mode than Matter, because it is conscious. It is also eternally real and eternally distinct. Final release, that comes, by the Lord's Grace, after the death of the body is a Communion with God. This philosophy believes in liberation through one's Karmas (actions) in accordance with the Vedas, the Varna (caste or class) system and the four Ashramas (stages of life), along with intense devotion to Vishnu. Individual Souls retain their separate identities even after moksha. They live in Fellowship with God either serving Him or meditating on Him. The philosophy of this school is SriVaishnavism, a branch of Vaishnavism.\n\n1. sarvam khalv idam brahma from Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1\n\nTranslated literally, this means \"All this is Brahman\". The ontology of Vishishtadvaita system consists of:\n\na. Ishvara is \"Para-brahman\" with infinite superlative qualities, whose substantive nature imparts the existence to the modes\n\nb. Jivas are \"chit-brahman\" or sentient beings (which possess consciousness). They are the modes of Brahman which show consciousness.\n\nc. Jagat is \"achit-brahman\" or matter/Universe (which are non-conscious). They are the mode of Brahman which are not conscious.\n\nBrahman is the composite whole of the triad consisting of Ishvara along with his modes i.e. Jivas and Jagat.\n\n2. ayam ātmā brahma from Mandukya Upanishad 1.2\n\nTranslated literally, this means the \"Self is Brahman\".\nFrom the earlier statement, it follows that on account of everything being Brahman, the self is not different from Brahman.\n\n3. Tat tvam asi from Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7\n\nTranslated literally, it means \"Thou art that\"\n\n\"that\" here refers to \"Brahman\" and \"thou\" refers to \"jiva\"\n\nRāmānujā chooses to take the position of universal identity. He interprets this passage to mean the subsistence of all attributes in a common underlying substratum. This is referred to as \"samānādhikaranya\". Thus Rāmānujā says the purport of the passage is to show the unity of all beings in a common base. Ishvara (\"Parabrahman\") who is the Cosmic Spirit for the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings, is also simultaneously the innermost self (Atmān) for each individual sentient being (Jīvā). All the bodies, the Cosmic and the individual, are held in an adjectival relationship (aprthak-siddhi) in the one Isvara.\n\nTat Tvam Asi declares that oneness of Isvara.\n\nWhen multiple entities point to a single object, the relationship is established as one of substance and its attributes.\n\nFor e.g. in a statement:\n\n\"Jack is a tall and intelligent boy\"\n\nThe descriptors \"tall-ness\",\"intelligence\" and \"boy-ness\" all refer to a common underlying \"Jack\"\n\nSimilarly, when the upanishads declare Brahman is the Universe, Purusha, Self, Prana, Vayu, and so on, the entities are attributes or modes of Brahman.\n\nIf the statement tat tvam asi is taken to mean as only \"the self is brahman\", then sarvam khalv idam brahma will not make sense.\n\nThis is an upanishadic concept which is employed while attempting to know Brahman. The purport of this exercise is understood in many different ways and also influences the understanding of Brahman.\nIn the overall sense, this phrase is accepted to refer to the indescribable nature of Brahman who is beyond all rationalisations.\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad 2-9-1 passage \"yato vacho nivartanthe..\" (words recoil, mind can not grasp...) etc., state the same concept regarding Brahman . The visishtadvaita interpretation is that these passages do not indicate a black hole, but the incompleteness of any statement or thought or concept concerning Brahman. Brahman is these and more. This interpretation is consistent with \"sarvam kalvidam brahma\". Antaryami Brahmanam of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad passage \"yasya prithvi sariram yasya atma sariram\" is also interpreted to show that Brahman is not a zero point - \"nirvisesha chinmatra\" (an entity which has nothing except existence)\n\nThe typical interpretation of Neti-Neti is \"not this, not this\" or \"neither this, nor that\". It is a phrase meant to convey the inexpressibility of Brahman in words and the futility of trying to approximate Brahman with conceptual models.In VisishtAdvaita, the phrase is taken in the sense of \"not just this, not just this\" or \"not just this, not just that\". This means that Brahman cannot be restricted to one specific or a few specific descriptions. Consequently, Brahman is understood to possess infinite qualities and each of these qualities are infinite in extent.\n\nThe purpose or goal of human existence is called purushartha. According to the Vedas, there are four goals namely artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), dharma (righteousness) and moksha (permanent freedom from worldly bondage). According to this philosophy, the first three goals are not an end by themselves but need to be pursued with the ideal of attaining moksha.\n\nMoksha means liberation or release from samsara, the cycle of rebirth.\n\nBhakti Yoga is the sole means of liberation in Vishishtadvaita. Through Bhakti (devotion), a Jiva ascends to the realm of the Lord, where it continues to delight in His service. Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga are natural outcomes of Bhakti, total surrender, as the devotee acquires the knowledge that the Lord is the inner self. A devotee realizes his own state as dependent on, and supported by, and being led by the Lord, who is the Master. One is to lead a life as an instrument of the Lord, offering all his thought, word, and deed to the feet of the Lord. One is to see the Lord in everything and everything in Him. This is the unity in diversity achieved through devotion.\nHowever Sri Ramanuja and the Vishishtadvata tradition accept Saranagati, total surrender at the Lord's lotus feet alone as the sole means to moksha, liberation from samsara and going to Vaikuntha. This is a distinguishing feature of this school of philosophy, as both Adishankara's advaita and Anandatirtha's dvaita accept bhakthi for moksha. Swami Ramanuja has supported this opinion with various citations directly from the vedas, and various incidents highlighting sharangathi as means to moksha, over bhakthi. Observing total surrender at the Lord's feet guarantees moksha at the end of this birth, and in the time between sharanagathi and death, the surrendered soul may spend his time piously by involving in devotion. So bhakthi is not a moksha sadhana, but just for anubhava in the Vishishtadvaita Sampradaya\n\nThe Vadakalai sect of Sri Vaishnavism associate themselves with Vedanta Desikan and Ramanujacharya. Vedanta Desikan is one of the foremost learned scholars and philosophers of medieval India, who has written more than a hundred works in Sanskrit and Tamil, Prakrit and Manipravala. He is said to have been born as an incarnation of the divine bell of Lord Venkateshwara of Tirupati and also of Ramanujacharya in the month of Purattasi under the star Thiruvonam (Sravana), in the year 1268 CE. All of his works are characterized by his versatility, irrefutable reasoning, logic, examination, deep spiritual insight, ethical fervour and excellent expressions of devotional emotion in delightful style. His Paduka-sahasram and \"Rahasyatrayasaram\" are some classic examples. He was a great teacher, logician, expositor, debater, poet, philosopher, thinker and defender of the faith of Vaishnavism. \"Kavitaarkika Simham\" (lion among poets and debaters), \"Sarvatantra Svatantrar\" (all-knowing and all-powerful), \"Vedaantaachaarya\" (the master and preceptor of the Vedanta) are some of the titles attributed to him.\n\nPillai Lokacharya literally meaning \"Teacher for the whole world\" is one of the leading lights on the Sri Vaishnava Vedanta philosophy. His work Sri Vachana Bhusanam is a classic and provides the essence of Upanishads. The Tenkalai sect of Sri Vaishnavism looks up to him apart from Swami Ramanuja and Swami Manavala Mamuni. He was a senior contemporary of Vedanta Desika. He is said to have been born as an \"amsa\" (\"essence\") of Kanchi Devaraja (Varadaraja) Perumal to document and immortalize Ramanuja's message in the month of Aippaci under the star Thiruvonam (Sravana), in the year 1205 CE. He is said to have lived for 106 years, during which time, he also helped to safeguard the idol of Ranganatha at Srirangam from Muslim invaders. Pillai Lokacharya confirmed the basics of the Sri Vaishnava system in his 18 monumental works popularly known as \"Ashtadasa Rahasyangal\" (\"the eighteen secrets\") also called the Rahasya granthas (\"doctrines that explain the inner meanings\") out of which Sri Vachana Bhushanam and Mumukshuppadi are the most famous. Manavala Mamuni expanded on and popularized Lokacharya's teachings arguments in Tamil.\n\n\nThe Absolute Supreme Reality referred to as Brahman, is a Transcendent Personality. He is Narayana, also known as Lord Vishnu.\n\n\"A man who has discrimination for his charioteer and holds the reins of the mind firmly, reaches the end of the road; and that is the supreme position of Vishnu.\" - 1.3.9 Katha Upanishad\n\n\"Beyond the senses are the objects; beyond the objects is the mind; beyond the mind, the intellect; beyond the intellect, the Great Atman; beyond the Great Atman, the Unmanifest; beyond the Unmanifest, the Purusha. Beyond the Purusha there is nothing: this is the end, the Supreme Goal.\"- 1.3.10,11 Katha Upanishad\n\nIn terms of theology, Ramanujacharya puts forth the view that both the Supreme Goddess Lakshmi and Supreme God Narayana together constitute Brahman - the Absolute. Sri Lakshmi is the female personification of Brahman and Narayana is the male personification of Brahman, but they are both inseparable, co-eternal, co-absolute and are always substantially one. Thus, in reference to these dual aspects of Brahman, the Supreme is referred to in the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya as Sriman Narayana.\n\nNarayana is the Absolute God. The Soul and the Universe are only parts of this Absolute and hence, Vishishtadvaita is the solution to panentheistic and pantheistic ideologies. The relationship of God to the Soul and the Universe is like the relationship of the Soul of Man to the body of Man. Individual souls are only parts of Brahman. God, Soul and Universe together form an inseparable unity which is one and has no second. This is the non-duality part. Matter and Souls inhere in that Ultimate Reality as attributes to a substance [needs to improvisation]. This is the qualification part of the non-duality.\n\n\n"}

Levine and Ann Frederick published in 1997. It presents a somatic experiencing approach which it says helps people who are struggling with psychological trauma. The book discusses inhibition and release of a form of \"energy\" that was poorly defined.\n\n\"Waking the Tiger\" contains four sections: Section I: The Body as Healer; Section II: Symptoms of Trauma; Section III: Transformation and Renegotiation; and Section IV: First Aid for Trauma. Peter Levine argues in the book that it is through action instead of talking that people can assist others who are struggling with psychological trauma. He presents the somatic experiencing approach.\n\nPeter A. Levine received a doctorate in medical biophysics from the University of California, Berkeley and has an independent psychology doctorate. In 1969 Levine encountered a graduate student, Nancy, who experienced brutalizing panic attacks, unexplainable in her view. Levine started their discussion with a typical relaxation technique. While Nancy was silently paying attention in her seat, she failed to react. When he continued attempting to get her to relax, she unexpectedly had a massive panic attack. Levine says he became immersed in her panic attack. In his mind, he suddenly saw a tiger stopped low and preparing to jump at them. Immersed in the nightmare, he ordered, \"Nancy! You are being attacked by a large tiger! See the tiger as it comes toward you! Run toward that tree! Run, Nancy, run! Climb up! Escape!\"\n\nLevine said Nancy's legs began moving as if she was sprinting. Nancy said that, for her first time, she had remembered a scary childhood experience. When she was three years old she experienced a tonsillectomy during which she was secured to an operating table to prevent movement. The anesthesia could have been only partially working which caused her to feel like she was being strangled. Her experience was drilled into her and could not just be remembered while she was alert. While counseling Nancy, Levine at the time also was researching predation, which Sandra Blakeslee and Matthew Blakeslee noted could be the reason Levine pictured a tiger. Experts generally have not found evidence to support Levine's findings; he found that for prey that have completely lost the ability to move, \"the sudden immobility of a highly charged nervous system compresses energy that is then 'stored' in the nervous system if not released\".\n\nWhen prey are able to avoid predators, however, prey will sprint away and \"literally shake off the residual effects of the immobility response\" while \"their bodies convulse with paroxysmal spasms\". There is no evidence for Levine's conclusions about the prey's responses or Nancy's response to their session. Observing Nancy, Levine concluded that her convulsions were an \"instinctive and long-overdue response\" to her being strapped down and scared when a child. He concluded without evidence that Nancy's panic attacks were caused by the \"frozen residue of 'energy'\" that remained stuck in her, not from the traumatic experience. Levine argues that humans cannot effortlessly release energy from a traumatic memory because human's triune brain structure which, shaped by feelings and acumen, frequently supersedes instinct. He said that Nancy stopped experiencing panic attacks after she had additional sessions with him that involved more convulsions\".\n\nRuth P. Newton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, wrote a mixed review of the book in the journal \"Psychosomatic Medicine\". She found the case materials to be \"interesting\" because readers can observe how Levine \"uses his theory to guide his clinical work\". But Newton found that \"the theory and case material are entangled by a self-help format that weakens his presentation and jeopardizes the overall organization of the book\". She concluded that \"the book is more appropriately used by professionals rather than directly by patients or clients\". Newton strongly criticized the book's self-help therapy activities that improperly claim to help readers to overcome their frightening experiences, writing, \"I shudder to imagine a patient or client who is drawn to self-help books that will \"heal\" secret traumas alone in his or her living room with an exercise that asks them to '… pretend you are in an airplane flying at 30,000 feet… [when] you suddenly hear a loud explosion…followed by complete silence'.\"\n\nJohn Marzillier for British Psychological Society wrote that \"The psychologist Peter Levine is a major figure in the trauma field. His earlier book, Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma (North Atlantic Books, 1997), aimed at a general readership, was very successful.\" Marzillier found that in \"Waking the Tiger\", the \"notion of 'energy' was relatively undeveloped, a weakness in his model\". In \"Psychology Today\", Cheryl Eckl called \"Waking the Tiger\" a \"seminal book\" in which Levine tells readers \"we can learn much about trauma from observing animals in the wild\".\n"}

He produced the earliest, reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound.\n\nWilliam Derham was the son of Thomas Derham. He was born at Stoulton, in Worcestershire, England. He was educated at Blockley, Gloucestershire and at Trinity College, Oxford from 1675 to 1679. He was ordained on 29 May 1681. In 1682, he became vicar of Wargrave, Berkshire and from 1689 to 1735 he was Rector at Upminster, Essex. While at Upminster, in 1716 he became a Canon of Windsor and the vestry minutes show that thereafter he divided his time between those two places. The parish registers of Upminster record his burial at St. Laurence's in 1735. However, the precise site of his grave is unknown and, in accordance with his wishes, there is no memorial to him in the church.\n\nIn 1696, he published his \"Artificial Clockmaker\", which went through several editions. The best known of his subsequent works are \"Physico-Theology\", published in 1713; \"Astro-Theology\", 1714; and \"Christo-Theology\", 1730. All three of these books are teleological arguments for the being and attributes of God, and were used by William Paley nearly a century later. However, these books also include quantities of original scientific observations. For example, \"Physico-Theology\" contains his recognition of natural variation within species and that he knew that \"Didelphis virginialis\" (the Virginia opossum) was the only marsupial in North America. It also includes one of the earliest theoretical descriptions of a marine chronometer, accompanied by a discussion of the use of vacuum seals to reduce inaccuracies in the operation of timepieces. He is the first person known to have used the word \"chronometer\".\n\nSimilarly, \"Astro-Theology\" includes several newly identified nebulae (this was the name used at the time for all extended astronomical objects: some of his nebulae are what we would now call star clusters). His 16-feet long telescope (also used when measuring the velocity of sound) was at the top of the tower of St Laurence's Church, where the necessary doors are still in place.\n\nOn 3 February 1703, Derham was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He was Boyle lecturer in 1711–1712. His last known work, entitled \"A Defence of the Church's Right in Leasehold Estates\", appeared as early as 1731.\n\nBut besides the works published in his own name, Derham contributed a variety of papers to the \"Transactions of the Royal Society\". He revised the \"Miscellanea Curiosa\". He edited the correspondence and wrote a biography of John Ray, whose 'physico-theology' (natural theology) tradition he continued, making him an early parson-naturalist.\n\nHe edited Eleazar Albin's \"Natural History\", and published some of the manuscripts of the scientist Robert Hooke. His meteorological observations at Upminster (in the \"Transactions of the Royal Society\") are amongst the earliest series in England.\n\nIn 1709 Derham published a more accurate measure of the speed of sound, at 1,072 Parisian feet per second. Derham used a telescope from the tower of the church of St Laurence, Upminster to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including North Ockendon church. The distance was known by triangulation, and thus the speed that the sound had travelled was calculated.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1757807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1757807", "title": "Xavier Zubiri", "text": "Xavier Zubiri\n\nXavier Zubiri (4 December 1898 – 21 September 1983) was a Spanish philosopher.\n\nZubiri was a member of the School of Madrid, composed by philosophers José Ortega y Gasset, Julián Marías and Pedro Laín Entralgo, among others. Zubiri's philosophy has been categorized as a \"materialist open realism\", which \"attempted to reformulate classical metaphysics, in a language that was entirely compatible with modern science\". This relates to Xavier Zubiri's educational background. Zubiri first received a philosophical and theological formation in Madrid and Rome. Later, he deepend his studies in philosophy through his graduate studies in Louvain, writing his dissertation on phenomenology. In 1929, Zubiri's critical interest in this current of thought took him to Freiburg, when he already was a professor in Madrid. There, he studied with Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. In 1930, Zubiri moved to Berlin, where he studied physics, philology and biology. There, he was hosted in Harnack House, which enabled Zubiri to socialize with important minds of this great period of academic activity in the Weimar republic. For example, Albert Einstein (whom Zubiri had already met in Madrid, at Universidad Central, in 1923), Max Planck, Werner Jaeger, Erwin Schrödinger, among others. \n\nWhen civil war broke out in Spain in 1936, Zubiri moved to Paris. There, he continued having an intensive intellectual life, attending courses with Louis de Broglie, Frédéric Joliot, Irène Curie, Elie Joseph Cartan and Emile Benveniste, among others. In 1939, just before France declared war to Germany, Zubiri returned to Spain. Zubiri's philosophy is little known outside of Spain and Latin America, mostly because Zubiri was compelled to resign from formal academic positions in Spain, in 1942. This had to do with the lack of academic freedoms in Francisco Franco's regime. However, it was possible for Zubiri to continue his work as an academic, through the sponsorship of family and friends. Zubiri was a prolific author in the Spanish magazines \"Cruz y Raya\" (led by José Bergamín) and \"Revista de Occidente\" (led by José Ortega y Gasset) under the second Spanish republic. However, after his resignation from Spanish universities, Zubiri did not publish much in established peer reviewed journals. Nonetheless, he did publish a series of books and research articles. Zubiri's work was initially not well received by established academic environments in Spain. This was mostly explained by the political context under Franco. But Zubiri's relationship to scholars like Ignacio Ellacuría made Zubiri's work widely known in Latin America, where Zubiri's thought has been further developed. \n\nRecently, Spanish academics have begun to recognize the importance of Zubiri's life and philosophy.\nFor the same reasons outlined above, Zubiri's contact with the formal academic environments of the English speaking world was limited. There is all but one recorded visit by Zubiri to the United States, specifically Princeton University, on October 2, 1946. In Princeton, Zubiri lectured in French on \"The real and mathematics- A philosophical problem\" (\"Le reel et les mathematiques—Un probleme de philosophie\"). Some of Zubiri's work has been translated to English: \"On Essence\" (Caponigri, 1980), \"Sentient Intelligence\" (Fowler, 1999), \"The Dynamic Structure of Reality\" (Orringer, 2003) and \"The Fundamental problems of Western Metaphysics\" (Redondo & Fowler 2009). Despite his relative academic isolation at home in Spain, Zubiri has also been recognized in other countries. In 1979, the German government awarded Zubiri and Laín Entralgo the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Zubiri was awarded this distinction for his work in his books \"Nature, History, God\" (1954) and \"On Essence\" (1962). Zubiri's work has also been translated to French, German, Italian and Portuguese.\n\nThis overview is taken from a more extensive list of articles and books by and about Xavier Zubiri. This list is continuously updated by \"Fundación Xavier Zubiri\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1363037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1363037", "title": "Zentatsu Richard Baker", "text": "Zentatsu Richard Baker\n\nZentatsu Richard Baker (born March 30, 1936), born Richard Dudley Baker, is an American Soto Zen master (or roshi), the founder and guiding teacher of Dharma Sangha—which consists of Crestone Mountain Zen Center located in Crestone, Colorado and the Buddhistisches Studienzentrum (Johanneshof) in Germany's Black Forest. As the American Dharma heir to Shunryu Suzuki, Baker assumed abbottship of the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC) shortly before Suzuki's death in 1971. He remained abbot there until 1984, the year he resigned his position after it was disclosed in the previous year that he and the wife of one of SFZC's benefactors had been having an ongoing affair. Despite the controversy connected with his resignation, Baker was instrumental in helping the San Francisco Zen Center to become one of the most successful Zen institutions in the United States.\n\nRichard Baker was born in Biddeford, Maine on March 30, 1936. Because his family moved around frequently, he lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Indiana, and Pittsburgh growing up. A descendant of Thomas Dudley, Baker was raised in a family of moderate wealth. He attended Harvard University, where he studied architecture and history. He then arrived in San Francisco, California in 1960—beginning to sit with Shunryu Suzuki in 1961. Baker was ordained a Sōtō priest by Suzuki in 1966 just before the opening of Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. Baker was instrumental in orchestrating the acquisition of Tassajara, raising $150,000 for the purchase in a short period of time. From 1968 to 1971, he traveled to Japan to practice at the primary Sōtō monasteries there, including Antaiji, Eiheiji, and Daitokuji.\n\nBaker received Dharma transmission from Suzuki in 1970, and then was installed as abbot of San Francisco Zen Center during the \"Mountain Seat Ceremony\" on November 21, 1971. Baker also penned the introduction to Suzuki's famous book, \"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\". Within a very short period of time Baker broadened the scope of SFZC, starting first with the acquisition of Green Gulch Farm in southern Marin county, in 1972. \n\nSan Francisco Zen Center expanded quickly with Baker at the helm. In fifteen years, the Center's annual budget increased from $6,000, to $4 million. It acquired property worth around $20 million and built up a network of affiliated businesses staffed by Zen Center students, which included the vegetarian Greens Restaurant in Fort Mason, a bakery, and a grocery store. In the midst of the growth, Baker became a popular public figure. Although his salary was reportedly modest, he lived a lifestyle which many perceived as extravagant. With so many students and so much public attention, some felt Baker became less available to the members of the community. All of this discontent emerged when it was made public that Baker had allegedly been having an affair with the wife of an influential sangha member.\n\nAlthough Baker claimed that his relationship with the woman was a love-affair which had not yet been consummated, the outcry surrounding the incident led to a series of accusations of impropriety on Baker's part, including the admissions by several female members of the community that they had had affairs with Baker before or during his tenure as abbot. The community's sense of crisis sharpened when the woman's husband, one of SFZC's primary benefactors, threatened to hold the organization legally responsible for its abbot's apparent misconduct.\n\nThese revelations led to community-wide pandemonium, and in 1984 Baker was forced to resign as abbot. However, San Francisco Zen Center's website now comments: \"Although the circumstances leading to his resignation as abbot in 1984 were difficult and complex, in recent years, there has been increased contact; a renewal of friendship and dharma relations.\" And Baker, for his part, is quoted as having said in a 1994 interview with Sugata Schneider:\nI don't think that the gossipy or official versions of what happened are right, but I feel definitely that if I were back in the situation again as the person I am now, it wouldn't have happened. Which means it's basically my fault. I had a kind of insecurity and self-importance, which I didn't see for a long time, that was a bad dynamic in the community.\nIn 1983 Tenshin Reb Anderson received shiho (Dharma Transmission) from Richard Baker. Anderson succeeded him as abbot, and later co-abbot.\n\nIn the late-1980s Baker also gave shiho to Issan Dorsey, whom he had ordained as a priest in 1975. Dorsey went on to serve as abbot of the Hartford Street Zen Center in San Francisco, where he worked to develop hospice care for AIDS patients.\n\nFollowing his departure from the San Francisco Zen Center in 1984, Baker relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico where he founded a new community known as Dharma Sangha. One student who followed him to his new community was the priest Philip Whalen (ordained by Baker as a priest in 1973), who became tanto (head monk) of the new center. In July 1987 Baker gave Dharma transmission to Whalen; Whalen later became abbot of the Hartford Street Zen Center (following the tenure of Issan Dorsey) in the Castro district of San Francisco. After the founding of Dharma Sangha in New Mexico, Baker met with William Irwin Thompson, the founder of the Lindisfarne Association. At a meeting of the Board of Directors of Lindisfarne at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, Thompson convinced the board to donate the campus that he had established--with its passive solar Lindisfarne Fellows House, Founder's House, and Lindisfarne Chapel--to Baker-roshi's Dharma Sangha. Baker then moved to Crestone, Colorado and Germany to found other practice sites for Dharma Sangha. Baker also gives seminars at Boulder Zen Center in Boulder, Colorado twice each year, typically on the last weekends of January and April.\n\nA once controversial figure, Richard Baker was publicly criticized for his behavior at San Francisco Zen Center. Former students have said that he was addicted to power, abusive of his position, extravagant in his personal spending, and inappropriate in his love life.\n\nIn the twenty-five years since leaving San Francisco Zen Center, Baker has continued his career as a Zen teacher, founding and developing two practice centers. Thich Nhat Hanh wrote of Baker, \"To me, he embodies very much the future of Buddhism in the West with his creative intelligence and his aliveness.\"\n\nOn September 25, 1999, Baker married Her Grand Ducal Highness Princess Marie Louise Elisabeth Mathilde Theodora Cecilie Sarah Charlotte of Baden, daughter of Maximilian, Margrave of Baden and wife Archduchess Valerie of Austria. Princess Marie Louise is grandniece of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and first cousin once removed of Charles, Prince of Wales. They have a daughter, Sophia Baker, born on March 1, 2001, in Alamosa, Colorado. He has two daughters, Sally and Elizabeth, from a prior marriage to Virginia Baker.\n\n\n\n\n"}
