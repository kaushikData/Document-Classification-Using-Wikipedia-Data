It was written in 1859 in the context of the construction of the Suez Canal and the recent Crimean War. The essay addresses the question of under what circumstances states should be allowed to intervene in the sovereign affairs of another country.\n\nMill's argument begins with a discussion of Britain's place in the world, in which Mill right away asserts that Britain, unlike other countries, never ventures into the outside world with an imperialistic aim; rather, when it does venture out, it is to improve the world, end conflicts, bring civilization, etc.: \"Any attempt [Britain] makes to exert influence...is rather in the service of others, than of itself\". Writing for a contemporary British middle and upper class audience, Mill gives an overview of some world events that were important for that particular time. \n\nThe main arguments for and against non-intervention are found in the second half of the script.\n\nThere seems to be no little need that the whole doctrine of non-interference with foreign nations should be reconsidered, if it can be said to have as yet been considered as a really moral question at all... To go to war for an idea, if the war is aggressive, not defensive, is as criminal as to go to war for territory or revenue; for it is as little justifiable to force our ideas on other people, as to compel them to submit to our will in any other respect. But there assuredly are cases in which it is allowable to go to war, without having been ourselves attacked, or threatened with attack; and it is very important that nations should make up their minds in time, as to what these cases are... To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error...\n\nAccording to Mill's opinion (in 1859) barbarous peoples were found in Algeria and India where the French and British armies had been involved. First, he argued that with \"barbarians\" there is no hope for \"reciprocity\", an international fundamental. Second, barbarians are apt to benefit from civilised intervenors, said Mill, citing Roman conquests of Gaul, Spain, Numidia and Dacia. Barbarians,\n\nhave no rights as a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the earliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral laws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government, are the universal rules of morality between man and man.\n\nSimilar arguments can today be found in theory on intervention in failed states. Of more widespread relevance, Mill discussed the position between \"civilized peoples\".\n\nThe disputed question is that of interfering in the regulation of another country's internal concerns; the question whether a nation is justified in taking part, on either side, in the civil wars or party contests of another: and chiefly, whether it may justifiably aid the people of another country in struggling for liberty; or may impose on a country any particular government or institutions, either as being best for the country itself, or as necessary for the security of its neighbours.\n\nMill brushes over the situation of intervening on the side of governments who are trying to oppress an uprising of their own, saying \"government which needs foreign support to enforce obedience from its own citizens, is one which ought not to exist\". In the case however of a civil war, where both parties seem at fault, Mill argues that third parties are entitled to demand that the conflicts shall cease. He then moves to the more contentious situation of wars for liberation.\n\nWhen the contest is only with native rulers, and with such native strength as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give to the question of the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so...\n\nNoam Chomsky has made reference to Mill's essay in a number of his books, including \"Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy\" (2006), \"\" (2002) and \"Peering into the Abyss of the Future\" (2002). Chomsky writes that even \"individuals of the highest intelligence and moral integrity succumb to the pathology\" of taking exception to universal human standards.\n\nLibertarian historian Joseph R. Stromberg states that J.S. Mill's imperialistic views are incompatible with his alleged liberalism, since maintenance of the British Empire would require government repression.\n\n\n"}

Acquired traits, which is synonymous with acquired characteristics, are not passed on to offspring through reproduction alone.\n\nThe changes that constitute acquired characteristics can have many manifestations and degrees of visibility but they all have one thing in common: they change a facet of a living organisms' function or structure after the organism has left the womb.\n\n\nAcquired characteristics can be minor and temporary like bruises, blisters, shaving body hair, and body building. Permanent but inconspicuous or invisible ones are corrective eye surgery and organ transplant or removal.\nSemi-permanent but inconspicuous or invisible traits are vaccinations and laser hair removal. Perms, tattoos, scars, and amputations are semi-permanent and highly visible.\n\nApplying makeup and nailpolish, dying one's hair or applying henna to the skin, and tooth whitening are not examples of acquired traits. They change the appearance of a facet of an organism, but do not change the structure or functionality.\n\nInheritance of acquired characters was historically proposed by renowned theorists such as Hippocrates, Aristotle, and French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Conversely, this hypothesis was denounced by other renowned theorists such as Charles Darwin.\nToday, although Lamarckism is generally discredited, there is still debate on whether \"some\" acquired characteristics in organisms are actually inheritable.\n\nAcquired characteristics, by definition, are characteristics that are gained by an organism after birth as a result of external influences or its own activities that change its structure or function and cannot be inherited. Therefore, every condition an organism is born with must be considered an inherited characteristic.\n\nInherited characteristics, by definition, are characteristics that are gained or predisposed to by an organism as a result of genetic transmission from its parents and will be passed to the organism's offspring. Therefore, every condition an organism does not gain or develop because of inheritance of its parents' genetic information must be considered an acquired characteristic.\n\nIt is fairly common for mammalian eyes to change color in the first years of life. This happens, with human infants and kittens being some well-known examples, because the eyes of the baby, just like the rest of its body, are still developing. This change can be as simple as blue to brown, or can involve multiple color changes in which neither the child's parents nor his/her doctors know when the changes will stop and what the final eye color will be.\n\nChanges in eye color signal changes in the arrangement and concentration of pigment in the iris, which is an example of structural color. Even though this change happens after birth, it is strictly as result of genes. While changes in eye appearance (and function, and structure) that occur because of acquired characteristics like injury, illness, old age, or malnutrition are definitely acquired characteristics, the infantile color change as described above is \"usually\" considered inherited.\nWhen diseases are caused by environmental influences, such as iodine deficiency or lead poisoning, their resultant symptoms are agreed to be acquired characteristics. However, it is debatable whether changes in bodily functions due to disorders that are partly or wholly genetic in origin are actually \"acquired\".\n\nWholly genetic disorders, such as Huntingtons, are ticking time-bombs that are inherited from parents' genes and are present before birth but the symptoms that develop, aka are \"acquired\", after birth are simply delayed manifestations of the inherited trait.\n\nDisorders that are partially genetic, such as ALS and allergies, mean the organism has inherited a predisposition to develop, aka \"acquire\", a certain condition but that inherited increased likelihood can be reduced or further increased depending on acquired characteristics of the organism.\n\nNew mutations, (often somatic, spontaneous and sporadic), not inherited from either parent are called de novo mutations. The consensus on whether certain prenatal spontaneous mutations and genetic disorders that occur as a result of meiotic and chromosome errors or during cell division after conception, like cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome, are considered to be acquired or inherited is unclear. Mutations and meiotic errors can be considered inherited since the organism is born with them \"in its genes\", but they can also be seen as prenatal acquired characteristics since they are \"not actually inherited\" from its parents.\nWith de novo mutations and division errors, the relationship between the offspring's altered genes and gene inheritance from the parents is technically spurious. These genetic errors can affect the mind as well as the body and can result in schizophrenia, autism, bi-polar disorder, and cognitive disabilities.\n\nThe definitions of inherited and acquired characteristics leave a for trauma, pre-existing and gestational maternal conditions that affect the fetus, as well as chemical and pathogen exposures and trauma that happen before and while an organism is born, such as AIDS, syphilis, Hepatitis B, chickenpox, rubella, unregulated gestational diabetes, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Most infections won't affect a fetus if the pregnant mother contracts it, but some can be transmitted to babies via the placenta or during birth, and others cause more severe symptoms in pregnant women or can cause complications to the pregnancy.\n\nThe World Health Organization defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\nAcquired characteristics don't need to affect the health of an organism, (a scar, suntan, or perm) but examples that do are often the first that come to mind when thinking of acquired characteristics since they are the easiest to observe and the ones that we, ourselves, are most familiar with.\n\nPhysical acquired characteristics can stem from various environmental influences such as disease, modification, injury, and regular or infrequent use of body parts.\n\nMental traits are acquired by learning and adapting native traits to the environment of the individual.\n\nLittle Albert experiment\n\ntrauma trigger\n\ncognitive\n\ncharacter\n\nBehavior\n\nSocialization\n\nParenting style\n\nSociological Illness\n\nSentiments are the result of the compounding of primary emotions, being \"bound up with knowledge and ideas.\" Only through vast experience in the natural world can humans learn to recognize objects in all of the various orientations in which we encounter them on a day-to-day basis. The ability to do something is an acquired characteristic, since a skill comes from one's knowledge, practice, aptitude, etc.\n\nMany acquired characteristics, such as injuries and diseases, directly affect only the mind but indirectly affect the body or directly affect only the body but indirectly affect the mind.\n\nSuppose you develop an articulation disorder after being hit in the head with a fastball from a Pro baseball pitcher. Once your concussion wears off, this is your \"only\" symptom. There's nothing wrong with your body, and nothing wrong with most of your mind but you stutter and slur and mispronounce your words so that people have a very hard time understanding you.\n\nHow would such a condition affect your life if you were a child?\nA child would be teased mercilessly by peers and have trouble communicating with friends and family.\n\nA student would not be able to communicate easily with classmates (collaborative assignments), teachers, tutors, and certain classes (choir, public speaking).\n\nWhat if you had a job where you needed to be able to talk to people? You wouldn't be able to easily talk to customers, other employees, or your boss. You couldn't answer phones or make calls, greet customers, do presentations.\nYou couldn't call your pet's name. You wouldn't even be able to use a fast food drive-through or tell your waitress what you wanted to order! You couldn't say, \"I love you,\" to your child, parent, or significant other.\n\nHow would you cope with the functional disorder? With the changes and the stress those changes caused?\n\nThe example in the above link deals with the loss of a single mental function. Imagine what would happen if a part of your body stopped working. Even something as simple as a broken finger causes many changes in lifestyle to compensate for the difference in function: writing, typing, drawing, driving, hobbies like gardening, fishing, or sports, using video game and TV controls, texting and dialing phone numbers, using cutlery to eat, opening a bag of chips or soda can, preparing food for yourself or your family, playing with your child or pet, unlocking and opening doors, bathing, brushing your teeth and hair, dressing yourself, typing your shoes, and more.\n\nThe person unable to pronounce words clearly would suffer additional stress, anxiety, frustration, and emotional upset from his functional limitation. There would be anxiety over financial hardships like bills from medical exams and tests, and a possible leave of absence or termination from work.\nPhysical effects of your articulation disorder could be paper cuts from your notepad, headaches over the stress, stubbed toes and sprained ankles from rushing to where you accidentally left you notepad, pulling a muscle from hauling a laptop around, etc. Worry could induce ulcers.\nIf you have to cut back on spending, your (and your family's) nutrition could suffer. There would be less money for fine dining, going out with friends, and indulging in toys and hobbies.\n\nThose close to you - family, friends, lovers - would be negatively affected by your limitation and your relationship with them would suffer as well.\n\nThere are four main types of disease: pathogenic disease, deficiency disease, hereditary disease, and physiological disease.\n\nCongenital disorders, known more commonly as birth defects, are DEFINITION.\n\nIt is possible for an unborn child to contract fetal diseases and perinatal infections.\n\nSuppose a pregnant woman is shot in her abdomen and the bullet hits the fetus, causing a non-fatal injury. Depending on the length of time between injury and birth, the baby could be born either with a still-healing wound or with a fully healed scar.\nRegardless of its state of healing, the gunshot wound could be considered an inherited characteristic, since the baby is born with the condition, or could be considered an acquired characteristic, since the condition did not happen as a result of genes inherited from its parents.\n\nThe gray area is that a prenatal gunshot wound obviously isn't an inherited, \"genetic\" condition but it can't be an acquired trait because it didn't happen \"after\" the baby's birth.\n\nHormones are chemicals released by a cell or a gland in one part of the body that affect cells in other parts of the organism.\n\nChemicals are substances with distinct molecular compositions that are produced by or used in a chemical process.\n\nDrugs are any substance that, when absorbed into the body of a living organism, alter normal bodily function. Drugs can be legal and be used as is medically prescribed by a doctor or be illegal to buy, sell, possess, and administer. They can be naturally occurring (such as caffeine and cannabis) or man-made (such as Chlorpromazine). Both legal and illegal drugs can be misused and abused. They have varying levels of dependence and some can cause addiction.\n\nWorth noting is the importance of prenatal nutrition to proper mental and physical development.\npregnancy\nPrenatal nutrition and birth weight\n\nRisk factors in pregnancy\n\nPremature birth\n\nPregnancy#Concomitant diseases\nMaternal health Complications of pregnancy\n\nAIDS\n\nThyroid disease in pregnancy\nGestational diabetes\n\nSmall for gestational age\nLarge for gestational age\nFailure to thrive\n\nSmoking and pregnancy\nHealth effects of tobacco\nComplications related to amniotic fluid\nMaternal physiological changes in pregnancy\n\nPrenatal stress\nPrenatal memory\n\nImmune tolerance in pregnancy\nPassive immunity\nVertical transmission\n\nNutrition and pregnancy\nVitamin B12 deficiency\n\nMirror syndrome\n\nReproductive health\n\nNon-Mendelian inheritance\nMaternal influence on sex determination\n\nThere is also reason to believe that the immune system of a baby will be healthier if, during pregnancy, the mother's immune system was regularly stimulated by exposure to pathogens.\nAcquired disorder\n\nSeason of birth\n\nIt is posited that the absence of exposure to parasites, bacteria, and viruses is playing a significant role in the development of autoimmune diseases in the more sanitized Western industrialized nations. Lack of exposure to naturally occurring pathogens may result in an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. (See hygiene hypothesis.)\n\nA complete explanation of how environmental factors play a role in autoimmune diseases has still not been proposed. However epidemiological studies, such as the meta analysis by Leonardi-Bee, et al., have helped to establish the link between parasitic infestation and autoimmune disease development, in other words, exposure to parasites reduces incidence of an autoimmune disease developing.\n\"Early life exposure to microbes (i.e., germs) is an important determinant of adulthood sensitivity to allergic and autoimmune diseases such as hay fever, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n\n\"Immunological diseases, such as eczema and asthma, are on the increase in westernized society and represent a major challenge for 21st century medicine. ...[G]rowing up on a farm directly affects the regulation of the immune system and causes a reduction in the immunological responses to food proteins,\" which not only means less severe reactions to food allergies, lactose intolerance, gluten sensitivity, etc., but reductions in the likelihood of developing them in the first place.\n\nDevelopmental impact of child neglect in early childhood\n\nSexuoerotic tragedy\n\nDisease is any condition that impairs the normal physical or mental (or both) function of an organism. (Though this definition includes injuries, it will not be discussed here). Diseases can arise from infection, environmental conditions, accidents, and inherited diseases.\n\nIt is not always easy to classify the source of a health problem. For instance, people can develop gout, which is known to cause permanent or near permanent changes to the human body, because of diet, inherited genetic predisposition, as a secondary condition from other diseases, or as an unintended side effect of certain medications.\n\nInfectious diseases can be caused by pathogens and microorganisms such as viruses, prions, bacteria, parasites, and fungi.\n\nFor infectious, environmental, and genetically predisposed conditions,\nlifestyle choices such as exercise, nutrition, stress level, hygiene, home and work environments, use or abuse of legal and illegal drugs, and access to healthcare (including an individual's financial ability and personal willingness to seek medical attention) especially in the early stages of an illness all combine to determine a person's risk factors for developing a disease or condition.\n\nPrecancerous condition\nProgressive disease\nlocalized disease to spread to other area of the body.\n\nOutline of nutrition\n\ncougar with shortened legs at Big Cat Rescue\n\nPoor nutrition and frequent injury and disease can reduce the individual's adult stature, but the best environment cannot cause growth to a greater stature than is determined by heredity.\n\nVitamin K deficiency\nmalnutrition\nNutrition disorder\n\nSleep debt\n\nTrauma is \"a body wound or shock produced by sudden physical injury, as from violence or accident,\" or, more simply put, is \"a physical wound or injury, such as a fracture or blow.\"\n\nAccidental injuries, most of which can be predicted and thus prevented, are the unintentional negative outcomes of unforeseen or unplanned events or circumstances which may have been avoided or prevented if reasonable measures had been taken or if the risks involving the circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized and acted upon (minimized).\n\nBattery is a criminal offense involving the use of force against another that results in harmful or offensive contact. (Assault is fear/belief of impending battery.)\nViolence is defined by the WHO as the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself or others that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation.\nConsent\n\nHead trauma in the form of a traumatic brain injury, stroke, drug or alcohol abuse, and infection have been known in some cases to cause changes to a person's mental processes, the most common being amnesia, ability to deal with stress and changes in aggression. There have also been documented cases of a person's personality changing more drastically, the best-known case being Phineas Gage, who in 1848 who survived a 1.1 meter long tamping iron being driven through his skull (though almost all presentations of Gage's subsequent personality changes are grossly exaggerated).\n\nThere is also the rare condition called Foreign Accent Syndrome in which someone who has suffered a brain injury will appear to speak in a new language or dialect. This is typically thought to be due to an injury to the linguistic center of the brain causing speech impairment that just happens to sound like a persons non-native language. This is thought to be the reasoning behind the urban legend where someone wakes from a coma or surgery and suddenly speaks a new language.\n\nBody modification is the deliberate altering of the human body for any non-medical reason, such as aesthetics, sexual enhancement, a rite of passage, religious reasons, to display group membership or affiliation, to create body art, shock value, or self-expression.\n\nThe of occurrence depends on the location, , and number of modifications, and, perhaps most importantly, on the mind of each individual being asked to accept the modifications on another.\n\nThe change can be extreme but still be accepted or at least tolerated by the majority (cosmetic surgery), or be extreme and opposed by most people (neck rings). Ear piercing is a minor aesthetic alteration that is widely accepted (on females' ears). The acceptance of highly diverse tattoos and body piercings depends on location, size, and number and, perhaps most importantly, on the mind of each individual being asked to accept it.\n\nAlso known as maiming, mutilation is any form of physical injury aimed at the bodily appearance or function of a living organism's body. Examples, include amputation, foot binding, and genital cutting.\nThe reasons for these changes can be rite of passage,\n\nLike other acquired characteristics, body modification results in permanent physiological changes that cannot be passed on to offspring genetically alone.\n\nConstant physical exercise such as swimming, running, and weight lifting can cause muscles to develop. However, muscles and other body parts can also waste away through atrophy due to disuse of said body parts. Both of these phenomena occur most of the time due to the living style of the organism and their effects on the physiology of the organism constitute of acquired characteristics such as either stronger muscles or disintegrated tissue.\n\nMany repetitive activities (sports, manual labor, chewing) create wear patterns and leave impressions on the bones and fascia that are highly specialized (sometimes even unique) to the activity. Over a lifetime, even such simple activities as posture and gait leave telltale impressions on our bodies.\nshoes.\nOccupational disease\nhobbies, sports\n\nPregnancy, drug consumption, exposure to chemicals, and other environmental influences can cause acquired characteristics to occur.\n\nComplications of pregnancy\nWilson's disease\n\n"}

{"id": "5641884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5641884", "title": "Bracketing paradox", "text": "Bracketing paradox\n\nIn linguistic morphology, the bracketing paradox concerns morphologically complex words which have more than one analysis, or \"bracketing\", e.g., one for phonology and one for semantics, and the two are not compatible, or brackets do not align.\n\nOne type of a bracketing paradox found in English is exemplified by words like \"unhappier\" or \"uneasier\". The synthetic comparative suffix \"-er\" generally occurs with monosyllabic adjectives and a small class of disyllabic adjectives with the primary (and only) stress on the first syllable. Other adjectives take the analytic comparative \"more\". Thus, we have \"older\" and \"grumpier\", but \"more correct\" and \"more restrictive\". From a phonological perspective, this suggests that a word like \"uneasier\" must be formed by combining the suffix \"er\" with the adjective \"easy\", since \"uneasy\" is a three syllable word:\nHowever, \"uneasier\" means \"more uneasy\", not \"not more easy\". Thus, from a semantic perspective, \"uneasier\" must be a combination of \"er\" with the adjective \"uneasy\":\nThis, however, violates the morphophonological rules for the suffix \"-er\". Phenomena such as this have been argued to represent a mismatch between different levels of grammatical structure.\n\nAnother type of English bracketing paradox is found in compound words that are a name for a professional of a particular discipline, preceded by a modifier that narrows that discipline: \"nuclear physicist\", \"historical linguist\", \"political scientist\", etc. Taking \"nuclear physicist\" as an example, we see that there are at least two reasonable ways that the compound word can be bracketed (ignoring the fact that \"nuclear\" itself is morphologically complex):\nWhat is interesting to many morphologists about this type of bracketing paradox in English is that the correct bracketing 2 (correct in the sense that this is the way that a native speaker would understand it) does not follow the usual bracketing pattern 1 typical for most compound words in English.\n\nPesetsky (1985) accounts for the bracketing paradox by proposing that phonological bracketing occurs in syntax and semantic bracketing occurs after the output is sent to LF. This solution is parallel to quantifier raising. For example, the sentence: \"Every farmer owns a donkey\" has two interpretations:\n\n\n\nDepending on which quantifier expression is higher, the meaning is shifted, but because this movement does not occur until LF, the structures are pronounced identically. Similarly to this account for scopal ambiguity in quantifier raising, Pesetsky proposes that in the structure of \"unhappier\", \"happy\" and the comparative suffix \"-er\" are the first to combine, since \"-er\" may not attach to adjectives that are longer than two syllables. It is then fed to PF before the next phase, at which the negative prefix \"un-\" is then attached. At LF in the following phase, \"-er\" undergoes raising, forcing the interpretation of the word to be \"more unhappy\" and not \"not happier\".\n\nSyntax: [ un [ happy er ] ] → LF: [ [ un [ happy \"t\" ] ] er ]\n\nAn alternative account is proposed by Newell (2005). She argues that \"un-\" adjoins at a late stage of the derivation in LF, possibly after the Spell-out of [happy -er]. Under this interpretation the stages are:\n\nSyntax: [ happy er ] → Late Insertion: [ [ un happy ] er ]\n\nContrasting with \"un-\", the prefix \"in-\", which also has negative meaning, is not allowed at late insertion. There are various pieces of evidence that \"in-\" is closer to the root.\n\n\nIn order to participate in these processes, \"in-\" must attach at an earlier level directly to the root in order to adjectivize it. Thus, because it attaches early, if it creates a three-syllable word, \"-er\" may not attach, as \"-er\" attaches at a later stage above the root derivation.\n\n\nA famous bracketing paradox of Russian verb complex such as \"razorvala\" 'she ripped apart' shows different phonological and semantic analyses:\n\nrazo rv a la\n\nPFX Root THEME 3SG.PST.F\nOne of the proposed solutions is parallel to the proposal for Navajo verbs with multiple prefixes. It includes head movement and Merger Under Adjacency, also called Glomming. For Russian, the derivation starts with [ T [ Asp [ v [ √V [ LP DP\"\"]]]]] It allows for the semantic bracketing as √V and LP are next to each other. Next, √V \"rv\" merges with v –\"a\" via head movement and further v complex merges with Asp also via head movement. Lexical Prefix \"razo-\" is phrasal and does not participate in the head movement. Thus, the complex structure emerging as a result of head movement to the exclusion of LP allows for the phonological bracketing. Finally, Glomming or Merger Under Adjacency takes place resulting in one verbal complex.\n\n"}

Edmond La Beaume Cherbonnier (February 11, 1918 – March 7, 2017) was an American scholar in the field of religious studies. He served as Professor of Religion at Trinity College, Connecticut, and as a deacon in the Episcopal Church. He is known for his work on Christianity, analyzing idolatry and distinctions between mystical and biblical thought, his efforts on developing and advancing religious studies, and for founding the Religion Department at Trinity College in 1955.\n\nEdmond Cherbonnier was born on February 11, 1918, in Saint Louis, Missouri. His father, Edward Goodwin Cherbonnier, was a vice president of the Ralston Purina Company.\n\nAfter graduation from St. Louis Country Day School, Cherbonnier entered Harvard University, where he majored in geology. In 1939, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts \"cum laude\". During his undergraduate years, when associated with Harvard’s Winthrop House, (one of twelve undergraduate residences) he was elected President of the Phillips Brooks House Association (a student-run public service organization). He was a member of the Winthrop House Committee and the Harvard Glee Club, and an active participant for several years in social service work at the Phillips Brooks House Association.\n\nCherbonnier held a brief post as teacher of Latin at Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut. Shortly thereafter, Cherbonnier enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in New York; his graduate studies were interrupted while he served as a naval aviator during World War II. After his wartime service, he resumed his theological studies and in 1947 received the degree of Bachelor of Divinity from Union. In the same year he was ordained a deacon by the Episcopal Bishop of Missouri. Subsequent study on a Fiske Fellowship from Harvard led to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts (1948) and Master of Arts (1952) from Cambridge University, England. Additionally, from 1948-1949 Cherbonnier was in residence as a Union Seminary Traveling Fellow at the University of Strasbourg and the University of Zurich.\n\nCherbonnier entered the doctoral program at Columbia University; while studying during the 1949-1950 school year, Cherbonnier was a tutor-assistant to Henry P. Van Dusen at Union. He held a one-year appointment as assistant professor of religion at Vassar (1950–1951) which resulted in a Ph.D. degree in religion conferred by Columbia. His doctoral thesis was entitled \"Freedom and Time: A Study in Some Recent Contributions to the Problem\".\n\nFrom Vassar, Cherbonnier joined the faculty of Barnard College of Columbia University, where he remained until the spring of 1955 as assistant and associate professor of religion. In addition, from 1952 to 1955 he served as Deacon at the nearby Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine, during the Deanship of the later controversial Bishop of California James A. Pike. On May 31, 1954, \"The New York Times\" highlighted one of his cathedral sermons in an article \"Worship Of Ideals Held Destructive\".\n\nCherbonnier received praise for his efforts early in his career. In 1952, Reinhold Niebuhr expressed gratitude to Cherbonnier in his Preface to \"The Irony Of American History\" \"for careful reading of my manuscript and for many suggestions for its improvement\".\n\nIn 1955, Cherbonnier’s book \"Hardness of Heart\" was published by Doubleday. A volume in the “Christian Faith Series” edited by Reinhold Niebuhr, the study provided a contemporary interpretation of the doctrine of sin. During the next year it was also published by London’s Victor Gollancz Ltd. Psychiatrist Karl Menninger, M.D. presented a synopsis of the book in his \"The Vital Balance\": “Cherbonnier in his beautiful essay, Hardness of Heart, describes the forms of idolatry indulged in by the hardhearted. He lists the hidden gods of cynicism as nationalism, humanism, phallicism, promiscuity, the glorification of money, and the various euphemisms such as frugality, shrewdness, and sound economy. Cherbonnier also lists iconoclasm, existentialist despair, and a so-called state of “adjustment” and “relatedness” toward which some psychiatrists are believed to steer their patients.”\n\nIn the fall of 1955, Cherbonnier was invited by Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, to establish a religion department. After serving two years as an associate professor, he was promoted to full professor and was then joined by a second department member, Dr. Theodor Marcus Mauch. Under Cherbonnier’s chairmanship, the department was enlarged to a staff of five full-time professors plus adjunct faculty.\n\nProfessor Cherbonnier was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity, honoris causa by the University of Vermont in 1959. He took a sabbatical leave in 1962-63 to London, England, which was partially underwritten by a Lilly Post-Doctoral Fellowship. He spent his sabbatical performing further work on distinctions between mystical and biblical thought. Dr. Cherbonnier took another leave for the 1970-1972 academic years plus the first semester of 1972-1973, which he also spent in England. He retired from his Trinity position in 1983.\n\nDr. Cherbonnier's interests include the Shroud of Turin and the life of Saint Joan of Arc (1412-1431 C.E.).\n\nHe is a chaplain in the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem - Priory in the United States.\n\nMany of Dr. Cherbonnier’s published writings, including Hardness of Heart, are accessible online. His papers were published in distinguished scholarly journals, such as the \"Harvard Theological Review, Commentary, Theology Today, Conservative Judaism\", and the \"Journal of Religion\". Additionally, he contributed essays to dictionaries and chapters to a number of books. His works include:\n\n"}

{"id": "1058313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058313", "title": "Francisco Suárez", "text": "Francisco Suárez\n\nFrancisco Suárez (5 January 1548 – 25 September 1617) was a Spanish Jesuit priest, philosopher and theologian, one of the leading figures of the School of Salamanca movement, and generally regarded among the greatest scholastics after Thomas Aquinas. His work is considered a turning point in the history of second scholasticism, marking the transition from its Renaissance to its Baroque phases. According to Christopher Shields and Daniel Schwartz, \"figures as distinct from one another in place, time, and philosophical orientation as Leibniz, Grotius, Pufendorf, Schopenhauer, and Heidegger, all found reason to cite him as a source of inspiration and influence.\"\n\nOf Jewish (converso) origins, Francisco Suárez was born in Granada, Andalusia (southern Spain), on 5 January 1548.\n\nAfter 3 years of preliminary studies from age 10 onwards, in 1561 Suárez matriculated at the University of Salamanca, and studied Law. In 1564, at age sixteen, Suárez entered the Society of Jesus in Salamanca and went through the two years of intense spiritual training under the guidance of Fr Alonso Rodriguez. In August 1566, Suárez took his first vows as a Jesuit; he then began in October 1566 to study Theology at Salamanca. It seems he was not a promising student at first; in fact, he nearly gave up his matters of study after failing the entrance exam twice. After passing the exam at third attempt, though, things changed.\n\nIn 1570, with the completion of his course, Suárez began to teach Philosophy, first at Salamanca as a Scholastic tutor, and then as a professor in the Jesuit college at Segovia. He was ordained in March 1572 in Segovia. He continued to teach Philosophy in Segovia until, in September 1574, he moved to the Jesuit College in Valladolid to teach Theology, a subject he would then teach for the rest of his life. He taught in a succession of different places: Avila (1575), Segovia (1575), Valladolid (1576) Rome (1580–85), Alcalá (1585–92) and Salamanca (1592–97). In 1597, he moved to Coimbra, some years after the accession of the Spanish (elder line) House of Habsburg to the Portuguese Throne, to take up the principal chair of Theology at the University of Coimbra. He remained there, aside from a brief time teaching at Rome, until his death in 1617.\n\nHe wrote on a wide variety of subjects, producing a vast amount of work (his complete works in Latin amount to twenty-six volumes). Suárez writings include treatises on law, the relationship between Church and State, metaphysics, and theology. He is considered the godfather of International Law. His \"Disputationes metaphysicae (Metaphysical Disputations\") were widely read in Europe during the 17th century and are considered by some scholars to be his most profound work.\n\nSuárez was regarded during his lifetime as being the greatest living philosopher and theologian, and given the nickname \"Doctor Eximius et Pius\" (\"Exceptional and Pious Doctor\"); Pope Gregory XIII attended his first lecture in Rome. Pope Paul V invited him to refute the arguments of James I of England, and wished to retain him near his person, to profit by his knowledge. Philip II of Spain sent him to the University of Coimbra in order to give it prestige, and when Suárez visited the University of Barcelona, the doctors of the university went out to meet him wearing the insignia of their faculties.\n\nAfter his death in Portugal (in either Lisbon or Coimbra) his reputation grew still greater, and he had a direct influence on such leading philosophers as Hugo Grotius, René Descartes, John Norris, and Gottfried Leibniz.\n\nIn 1679 Pope Innocent XI publicly condemned sixty-five casuist propositions, taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, Suárez and others, mostly Jesuit, theologians as \"propositiones laxorum moralistarum\" and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of excommunication.\n\nHis most important philosophical achievements were in metaphysics and the philosophy of law. Suárez may be considered the last eminent representative of scholasticism. He adhered to a moderate form of Thomism and developed metaphysics as a systematic enquiry.\n\nFor Suárez, metaphysics was the science of real essences (and existence); it was mostly concerned with real being rather than conceptual being, and with immaterial rather than with material being. He held (along with earlier scholastics) that essence and existence are the same in the case of God (see ontological argument), but disagreed with Aquinas and others that the essence and existence of finite beings are really distinct. He argued that in fact they are merely \"conceptually\" distinct: rather than being really separable, they can only logically be conceived as separate.\n\nOn the vexed subject of universals, he endeavored to steer a middle course between the realism of Duns Scotus and the nominalism of William of Occam. His position is a little bit closer to nominalism than that of Thomas Aquinas. Sometimes he is classified as a \"moderate nominalist\", but his admitting of objective precision (\"praecisio obiectiva\") ranks him with moderate realists. The only veritable and real unity in the world of existences is the individual; to assert that the universal exists separately \"ex parte rei\" would be to reduce individuals to mere accidents of one indivisible form. Suárez maintains that, though the humanity of Socrates does not differ from that of Plato, yet they do not constitute \"realiter\" one and the same humanity; there are as many \"formal unities\" (in this case, humanities) as there are individuals, and these individuals do not constitute a factual, but only an essential or ideal unity (\"In such a way, that many individuals, which are said to be of the same nature, are so: only through the operation of the intellect, not through a substance or essence of things which unites them\"). The formal unity, however, is not an arbitrary creation of the mind, but exists \"in the nature of the thing, prior [ontologically] to any operation of the intellect\".\n\nHis metaphysical work, giving a remarkable effort of systematisation, is a real history of medieval thought, combining the three schools available at that time: Thomism, Scotism and Nominalism. He is also a deep commentator of Arabic or high medieval works. He enjoyed the reputation of being the greatest metaphysician of his time. He thus founded a school of his own, \"Suarism\" or \"Suarezianism\", the chief characteristic principles of which are: \n\nSuárez made an important investigation of being, its properties and division in \"Disputationes Metaphysicae\" (1597), which influenced the further development of theology within Catholicism. In the second part of the book, disputations 28-53, Suárez fixes the distinction between \"ens infinitum\" (God) and \"ens finitum\" (created beings). The first division of being is that between \"ens infinitum\" and \"ens finitum\". Instead of dividing being into infinite and finite, it can also be divided into \"ens a se\" and \"ens ab alio\", i.e., being that is from itself and being that is from another. A second distinction corresponding to this one:\"ens necessarium\" and \"ens contingens\", i.e., necessary being and contingent being. Still another formulation of the distinction is between \"ens per essentiam\" and \"ens per participationem\", i.e., being that exists by reason of its essence and being that exists only by participation in a being that exists on its own (\"eigentlich\"). A further distinction is between \"ens increatum\" and \"ens creatum\", i.e., uncreated being and created, or creaturely, being. A final distinction is between being as \"actus purus\" and being as \"ens potentiale\", i.e., being as pure actuality and being as potential being. Suárez decided in favor of the first classification of the being into \"ens infinitum\" and \"ens finitum\" as the most fundamental, in connection with which he accords the other classifications their due. In the last disputation 54 Suárez deals with \"entia rationis\" (beings of reason), which are impossible intentional objects, i.e. objects that are created by our minds but cannot exist in actual reality.\n\nIn theology, Suárez attached himself to the doctrine of Luis Molina, the celebrated Jesuit professor of Évora. Molina tried to reconcile the doctrine of predestination with the freedom of the human will and the predestinarian teachings of the Dominicans by saying that the predestination is consequent upon God's foreknowledge of the free determination of man's will, which is therefore in no way affected by the fact of such predestination. Suárez endeavoured to reconcile this view with the more orthodox doctrines of the efficacy of grace and special election, maintaining that, though all share in an absolutely sufficient grace, there is granted to the elect a grace which is so adapted to their peculiar dispositions and circumstances that they infallibly, though at the same time quite freely, yield themselves to its influence. This mediatizing system was known by the name of \"congruism.\"\n\nHere, Suárez's main importance stems probably from his work on natural law, and from his arguments concerning positive law and the status of a monarch. In his massive work, \"Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore\" (1612), he is to some extent the precursor of Grotius and Pufendorf, in making an important distinction between natural law and international law, which he saw as based on custom. Though his method is throughout scholastic, he covers the same ground, and Grotius speaks of him with great respect. The fundamental position of the work is that all legislative as well as all paternal power is derived from God, and that the authority of every law stems ultimately from God's eternal law. Suárez denies the patriarchal theory of government and the divine right of kings founded upon it, doctrines popular at that time in England and to some extent on the Continent. He argued against the sort of social contract theory that became dominant among early-modern political philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, but some of his thinking, as transmitted by Grotius, found echoes in later liberal political theory.\n\nHe argued that human beings have a social nature bestowed upon them by God, and this includes the potential to make laws. However, when a political society is formed, the authority of the state is not of divine but of human origin; therefore, its nature is chosen by the people involved, and their natural legislative power is given to the ruler. Because they gave this power, they have the right to take it back and to revolt against a ruler, only if the ruler behaves badly towards them, and they must act moderately and justly. In particular, the people must refrain from killing the ruler, no matter how tyrannical he may have become. If a government is imposed on people, on the other hand, they have the right to defend themselves by revolting against it and even kill the tyrannical ruler.\n\nThough Suárez was greatly influenced by Aquinas in his philosophy of law, there are some notable differences. Aquinas broadly defined \"law\" as \"a rule and measure acts, whereby man is induced to act or is restrained from acting\" (ST 1-11, qu. 90, art. 1). Suárez argues that this definition is too broad, since it applies to things that are not strictly laws, such as unjust ordinances and counsels of perfection. Suárez also takes issue with Aquinas' more formal definition of \"law\" as \"an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated\" (ST 1-11, qu. 90, art. 4). This definition, he claims, fails to recognize that law is primarily an act of will rather than an act of reason, and would wrongly count orders to particular individuals as being laws. Finally, Suárez disagrees with Aquinas's claim that God can change or suspend some of the secondary precepts of the natural law, such as the prohibitions on murder, theft, and adultery (ST 1-11, qu. 94, art. 5). Suárez argues that the natural law is immutable as long as human nature remains unchanged, and that what may appear to be divinely-made changes in the natural law are really just alterations of subject matter. For example, when God orders Hosea to take a \"wife of fornications\" (i.e., sleep with a prostitute), this is not an exemption from God's prohibition of adultery. \"For God has power to transfer to a man \"dominium\" over a woman without her consent, and to effect such a bond between them that, by virtue of this bond, the union is no longer one of fornication.\"\n\nIn 1613, at the instigation of Pope Paul V, Suárez wrote a treatise dedicated to the Christian princes of Europe, entitled \"Defensio catholicae fidei contra anglicanae sectae errores\" (\"Defense of the Universal Catholic Faith Against the Errors of the Anglican Sect\"). This was directed against the oath of allegiance which James I required from his subjects.\n\nJames (himself a talented scholar) caused it to be burned by the common hangman and forbade its perusal under the 'severest penalties, complaining bitterly to Philip III of Spain for harbouring in his dominions a declared enemy of the throne and majesty of kings.\n\nThe contributions of Suarez to metaphysics and theology exerted significant influence over 17th and 18th century scholastic theology among both Roman Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThanks in part to the strength of Suárez's Jesuit order, his \"Disputationes Metaphysicae \"was widely taught in the Catholic schools of Spain, Portugal and Italy.\n\nIt also spread from these schools to many Lutheran universities in Germany, where the text was studied especially by those who favoured Melanchthon rather than Luther's attitude towards philosophy. In a number of seventeenth-century Lutheran universities the \"Disputationes\" served as a textbook in philosophy.\n\nIn a similar way, Suárez had major influence in the Reformed tradition of German and Dutch schools for both metaphysics and law, including international law. His work was highly praised, for example, by Hugo Grotius (1583-1645).\n\nHis influence is evident in the writings of Bartholomaeus Keckermann (1571–1609), Clemens Timpler (1563–1624), Gilbertus Jacchaeus (1578–1628), Johann Heinrich Alsted (1588–1638), Antonius Walaeus (1573–1639), and Johannes Maccovius (Jan Makowski; 1588–1644), among others. This influence was so pervasive that by 1643 it provoked the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Revius to publish his book-length response: \"Suarez repurgatus.\" Suárez's \"De legibus\" was cited as among the best books on law by the Puritan Richard Baxter, and Baxter's friend Matthew Hale drew on it for his natural-law theory.\n\nThe views of Suarez upon the human origin of political order, and his defense of tyrannicide emanating from popular dissent were heavily criticized by English philosopher Robert Filmer in his work \"Patriarcha, Or the Natural Power of Kings. \"Filmer believed the Calvinists and the Papists like Suarez to be dangerous opponents of divine right monarchy, legitimized by the supremacy of fathers upon their offspring, which Filmer claimed could be traced back to Adam.\n\n\nIn the 18th century, the Venice edition of \"Opera Omnia\" in 23 volumes in folio (1740–1751) appeared, followed by the Parisian Vivès edition, 26 volumes + 2 volumes of indices (1856–1861); in 1965 the Vivés edition of the \"Disputationes Metaphysicae\" (volls. 25-26) was reprinted by Georg Olms, Hildesheim.\nFrom 1597 to 1636 the \"Disputationes Metaphysicae\" were published in seventeen editions; no modern edition of Suárez's complete works is yet available and only few of Suárez's \"Disputations\" have been translated into English.\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Héloïse Godet, Kamel Abdeli, Richard Chevallier, Zoé Bruneau, Jessica Erickson and Christian Grégori and was shot by cinematographer Fabrice Aragno. It is Godard's 42nd feature film and 121st film or video project. In the French-speaking parts of Switzerland where it was shot, the word \"adieu\" can mean both goodbye and hello. The film depicts a couple having an affair. The woman's husband discovers the affair and the lover is killed. Two pairs of actors portray the couple and their actions repeat and mirror one another. Godard's own dog Roxy Miéville has a prominent role in the film and won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Like many of Godard's films it includes numerous quotes and references to previous artistic, philosophical and scientific works, most prominently those of Jacques Ellul, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Mary Shelley.\n\nGodard became interested in making a 3D film in 2010 and asked Aragno to make some camera tests. Aragno was dissatisfied with the results of professional 3D cameras and built his own custom rigs using Canon 5Ds and Flip Minos. Aragno broke many of the standard rules for 3D cinematography. Godard and Aragno worked on the film for four years, each shooting footage independently before officially beginning production with the actors. Godard edited a 2D version of the film before he and Aragno perfected the 3D cut with color correction and surround sound.\n\nIt premiered in competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and won the Jury Prize. It was distributed in France by Wild Bunch and in the US by Kino Lorber, and won Best Picture at the 2014 National Society of Film Critics Awards. It received a generally positive reception and was listed as one of the best films of the year on several critics lists. In particular, praise went to its visual style, while criticism was levied at the plot, which some deemed \"incomprehensible.\" Many critics have attempted to analyze the film's themes and its use of 3D.\n\nSome of the film's more elaborate shots have been called innovative techniques of the film vocabulary. These include a \"separation\" shot in which a single, unbroken shot splits into two separate shots that can be viewed simultaneously through either the left or the right eye, and then returns to one single 3D shot. Aragno and Godard also experimented with double exposure 3D images and shots with parallax that are difficult for the human eye to see.\n\n\"Goodbye to Language\" is an experimental narrative that tells two similar versions of a couple having an affair. These two stories are named \"1 Nature\" and \"2 Metaphor\", and they respectively focus on the couples Josette and Gédéon and Ivitch and Marcus – along with a dog (Godard's own dog Roxy).\n\nThe film begins with \"1 Nature\" at the Nyon cultural center. A young couple, Marie and her boyfriend, are setting up a used bookstand. Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. By the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears that he is a professor. Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to physically drag her away, the man retreats out of frame and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who has been watching all along, follows her. As Josette washes her hands in a fountain, Gédéon approaches and declares to her, \"I am at your service.\"\n\nThe film switches to \"2 Metaphor\". At the Nyon lakefront Davidson is sitting on a bench looking through a book of Nicolas de Staël reproductions when Marie and her boyfriend arrive to say goodbye before they go to the United States. Ivitch arrives, dressed like Davidson in matching trench coat and hat. While the two discuss the tyranny of images, the German speaking man arrives and the scene plays out as before: he accosts Ivitch, fires his gun, and leaves. As before, a man approaches the shaken woman. This time it is the man that is offscreen and the woman who is onscreen (Ivitch behind metal bars – an image frequently used in promotion of the film). The man, Marcus, puts his hand on the bars and declares, \"I am at your service.\"\n\nThe film returns to \"1 Nature.\" Gédéon and Josette are in the process of having affair and are staying in a house together in the summer; they talk about literature and domestic issues. Gédéon references Rodin's \"The Thinker\" while sitting on a toilet and declares that people are made equal through the act of defecating. At some point, the scene shifts to Nyon where Marie examines the body of an unidentified man. Returning to Gédéon and Josette's affair, the dog Roxy frolics in the countryside as a narrator talks about human's relationship with dogs. He wanders into a car with Gédéon and Josette, who bring him home and continue talking with Roxy present. Josette mentions a knife that Gédéon gave her four years earlier. Gédéon and Josette leave to board a ferry, leaving Roxy behind.\n\nThe film returns to \"2 Metaphor.\" Marcus and Ivitch have an affair in the same house in the winter; they talk about painting and political issues, such as Mao Zedong's opinion of the French Revolution and how Russians will never be Europeans. They have an argument while showering together, followed by shot of a bloody knife in a sink. As their relationship deteriorates, Ivitch reminds Marcus that he told her \"I am at your service.\" Marcus declares that they should have children, Ivitch says that they should get a dog instead.\n\nIn an epilogue titled \"3 Memory/historical misfortune\" Roxy is again in the countryside while a voiceover narration representing Roxy's thoughts (and paraphrasing Clifford D. Simak's \"Time and Again\") wonders what the water is trying to say to him. A narrator mentions that Mary Shelley wrote \"Frankenstein\" near the couples house in Cologny; Shelley is seen in the country writing her book with quill and ink and is joined by Lord Byron and Percy Shelley. An unseen man and woman (Godard and Florence Colombani) paint with watercolors and black ink. They order Roxy out of the room and (paraphrasing Dostoyevsky's \"Demons\") compare Kirillov's two questions, \"a big one and a little one\" (the other world and suffering) and the \"difficult[y of] fit[ting] flatness into depth\" to the act of creating art. Roxy falls asleep on a couch as a narrator (Anne-Marie Miéville) describes his thoughts and the film ends with the sounds of a dog barking and a baby crying.\n\nLike many of Godard's films, \"Goodbye to Language\" contains numerous references to other works of art or science intertwined within the narrative. It includes clips from such films as Boris Barnet's \"By the Bluest of Seas\", Rouben Mamoulian's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", Jean-Pierre Melville's \"Les Enfants terribles\", Artur Aristakisyan's \"Ladoni\", Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\", Howard Hawks's \"Only Angels Have Wings\", Robert Siodmak's \"People on Sunday\", Alexandre Aja's \"Piranha 3D\" and Henry King's \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\". It verbally quotes Jean Cocteau's \"Testament of Orpheus\" without showing any clips and uses archival footage from political events of the twentieth century, such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe film references or quotes several writers of literature, science, philosophy and political theory. These include both direct quotes (often paraphrased by characters or unseen narrators) and copies of books seen in shots. The references include Alain's \"Feelings, Passions and Signs\", Jean Anouilh's \"Antigone\", Guillaume Apollinaire's \"Alcools\", Louis Aragon's \"Elsa, je t'aime\", Alain Badiou's \"The Rebirth of History\", Samuel Beckett's \"The Image\", Joceyln Benoist's \"Concepts: Introduction to Analysis\", Maurice Blanchot's \"Awaiting Oblivion\", Jorge Luis Borges's \"The Book of Sand\", Louis-Ferdinand Céline's \"The Church\" and \"Letter to Elie Faure\", Jacques Chardonne's \"Eva or the Interrupted Journal\", Pierre Clastres's \"Society Against the State\", Jean-Paul Curnier's \"A World at War\", Charles Darwin's \"The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex\", Jacques Derrida's \"The Animal That Therefore I Am\", Françoise Dolto's \"The Gospel at the Risk of Psychoanalysis\", Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"Demons\", Jacques Ellul's \"The Victory of Hitler?\", Gustave Flaubert's \"Sentimental Education\", Hadrien France-Lanord's \"Heidegger: Thought Irreducible to its Errors\", Didier Franck's \"Nietzsche and the Shadow of God\", Sigmund Freud's \"Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis\", Julien Green's \"Journal\", Victor Hugo's \"Expiation\", Emmanuel Levinas's \"Totality and Infinity\", Cesar Pavese's \"The House on the Hill\", Ezra Pound's \"Works and Usury: Three Essays\", Marcel Proust's \"Jean Santeuil\" and \"La Prisonnière\", Rainier Maria Rilke's \"Duino Elegies\", George Sand's \"Elle et Lui\" and \"Lettres à Alfred de Musset\", Louis Antoine de Saint-Just's \"Rapport à la convention, March 3, 1794\", Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\", \"The Age of Reason\", \"Nausea\" and \"The Traitor\", Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Peter Bell the Third\", Clifford D. Simak's \"Time and Again\" and \"City\", Philippe Sollers's \"Interview with Philippe Forest\", Paul Valéry's \"Aphorismes\", François Villon's \"Hanged Man's Ballad\", Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\", Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's \"The Gulag Archipelago\", Léon Brunschvicg's \"Descartes et Pascal, lecteurs de Montaigne\", A.E. Van Vogt's \"The World of Null-A\", V.S. Naipaul's \"A Bend in the River\", Mao Zedong (or Zhou Enlai's) famous \"too early to tell\" quote, Laurent Schwartz's Theory of Distributions, Paul Dirac's Dirac delta function, Plato's proverb \"beauty is the splendour of the truth\" and works by Bernhard Riemann, Jack London and Luc Ferry.\n\nIt includes references to Claude Monet and Auguste Rodin's \"The Thinker\" and images by painter Nicolas de Staël.\n\nGodard even quotes himself: \"Showing a forest, easy. But showing a room with a forest nearby, \"difficult\"\" is paraphrased from Godard's 1958 review of Alexandre Astruc's film \"Une Vie\". Some of the references are false, such as a Marcel Proust quote erroneously attributed to Claude Monet and a quote by William Faulkner that is not traceable in his known works.\n\nMusic in the film includes Alfredo Bandelli's folk song \"The Witch Hunt\", sung by Pino Masi. There are also brief fragments of Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Symphony no. 7, Second Movement\", Giya Kancheli's \"Abii Ne Viderem\", Dobrinka Tabakova's \"Suite in Old Style, Part II\", Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Slavic March\", Arnold Schoenberg's \"Transfigured Night\", Jean Sibelius's \"Symphony No. 2\" and \"Valse triste\" and Valentyn Sylvestrov's \"Holy God\".\n\n\nGodard first announced plans for the film during the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, when he said its title would be \"Adieu au Langage\". In a November 2010 interview, he joked that he wanted to cast Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, and said that \"it's about a man and his wife who no longer speak the same language. The dog they take on walks then intervenes and speaks.\" He also revealed his interest in 3D and the possibility of using his own dog in the film. Godard initially wanted to cast major stars in the lead roles and asked Sophie Marceau and Vincent Cassel to play the couple. Cassel refused and Godard decided to use unknown actors instead. That year Godard had contemplated retirement, but according to his longtime cinematographer Fabrice Aragno \"he cannot live without making films.\"\n\nFilming took place in Switzerland, including at Nyon near Lake Geneva and at Godard's home in Rolle. Godard worked with minimal equipment and a small crew, including Aragno, Godard's assistant Jean-Paul Battaggia and a \"young man who ensures that the actors and props don't go missing and no passersby wander into the frame.\" All the equipment fit into a single van and included two 3D cameras, a handheld camera which Godard operated, a sound recorder and an umbrella. Godard said that he prefers working with small crews instead of larger ones \"as there are for American films where they are allowed to have forty people. Because, if there are fewer of them, they feel too lonely.\" The film's footage was shot over a four-year period.\n\nGodard wrote a detailed script for the film that included both text and storyboards; however, instead of a traditional script, the scenario consisted of \"a series of written prose pieces with jottings and ideas.\" Kamel Abdeli said that he had to google all the references in the script so that he could understand it, stating, \"you couldn't read the scenario – you could feel it and look at it.\" Actor Daniel Ludwig wrote that \"Alongside sibylline texts and the master's own handmade collages and images, the screenplay is wildly, chaotically, wonderfully suggestive, an artwork.\"\n\nBoth the female lead (Héloïse Godet and Zoé Bruneau) and the male lead (Kamel Abdeli and Richard Chevallier) were intentionally cast to physically resemble each other. The scenes with Bruneau and Chevallier were shot in the summer, while the scenes with Godet and Abdeli were shot in the winter. The actors waited two and a half years to begin shooting after first being cast due to constant delays. After rehearsing for two years, Abdelli travelled from Paris to Rolle for the first day of shooting, only to discover that Godard had changed his mind. Bruneau's 2014 memoir \"Waiting for Godard\" chronicles the making of the film. Godard often re-wrote scenes the night before filming and allowed no improvisation on set, aside from minor screen blocking. One such improvisation involved an actress sitting in front of a lamp, resulting in lens flare that Aragno called \"magic\" in 3D. Godet said that Godard's direction was \"very precise and very gentle, but clear and no discussion about it.\" There was very little rehearsal time for the actors, but Aragno took a lot of time to set up each shot. French film historian Florence Colombani was asked to travel to Godard's home and act in the film, then discovered that he only wanted to film her hands drawing the Cross of Lorraine while she spoke her dialogue.\n\nAragno said that he and Godard did not want to use 3D as a typical special effect or gimmick. Instead, they wished to use it \"to express new things.\" Several cameras were used, but the majority was shot on the Canon 5D and the Canon 1DC. Other cameras included GoPros and Lumixes. Aragno used Leica lenses on the Canons \"because the Canon lenses are too perfect ... How can you fall in love with a digitally perfect person? To err is human! The Leica lenses have some involuntary imperfections.\" The Canon cameras allowed them to shoot most of the film using natural or available light sources. Godard intentionally framed shots for 3D images, such as when the character's shadows are in 2D but the sidewalk is in 3D. The dog in the film is Godard's own pet Roxy Miéville, whom Godard would film whenever he took him for a walk. Godard used consumer cameras from Fujifilm and Sony for these shots. Aragno also shot some footage independently before production officially began, including shots of his two children running around olive trees.\n\nAragno recorded the sound during production and was later the sound mixer during post-production. Godard edited a 2D rough cut of the film before he and Aragno worked on the 3D final cut. Godard edited the first cut alone on HDCAM. Aragno said that:\n\nWhen he wants to insert something, he overlaps the images ... Jean-Luc separates the images he's editing from the editing console. He arranges the screen perpendicular to the console so that there's nothing between him and the image. He has to turn away to make the edit. He decides edits very quickly. After he's seen all the footage, he uses small thumbnails from photocopied or printed images of each scene, and makes books, gluing each image to a page.\n\nAragno used Godard's first cut to manually synchronize the left and right images into the first 3D cut, which he said \"took some time!\" Godard was initially disappointed with the cut, which \"had mono sound and very little color correction.\" On 18 March Aragno arranged a screening of a 3D cut with a stereo soundtrack for Godard at a Paris movie theater. Aragno said that they also edited a 2D version of the film that \"layers the two images like a double exposure\", which Godard thought may be the version screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Godard had not seen any 3D footage of the film until this screening and was immediately happy with the final result.\n\nThe editing of the final cut took two weeks at Godard's home, which they nicknamed \"Chez les Anglais\". Godard and Aragno \"set up three synchronized computers, Pro Tools for the Surround sound mix, Da Vinci Resolve for color correction and 3-D managing, and Final Cut to play what was rendered by DaVinci synched with the ProTools sound mix. The idea was to mix, color correct, and edit at the same time in HD 3-D. We edited two minutes a session.\"\n\nShortly after finishing \"Film Socialism\" (and after the success of the American 3D film \"Avatar\") Godard asked Aragno to shoot some test footage in 3D. With assistance from Battaggia and cinematographer Paul Grivas (Godard's nephew), Aragno researched and experimented with 3D techniques and built his own custom camera rigs. He began by using \"an expensive Panasonic camera that had built-in 3-D\", but was unimpressed with the results. In his experiments Arango concluded that the standard \"rules\" for 3D cinematography (\"You can't be more than six centimeters between the two cameras. If the background and foreground are too far away, it cannot be good.\") were not interesting. Aragno then built a rig out of wood with two Canon 5Ds, which he said \"was much more rough and expressive. Normally in two-camera 3-D, the cameras are very close together to minimize the parallax. With the rig I built, the two 5Ds were about five centimeters apart, producing a much harder 3-D image.\" In his rig, one of the cameras was upside down \"so I could register the sensors in the same angle-of-view for perfect or 'imperfect' 3D, avoiding parallax and so to get the best effect from both cameras. There were no computers involved in this calibration. Just a hammer and a chisel. It is artisan filmmaking.\"\n\nAragno built another rig with two Flip Mino cameras that allowed one of the cameras to pan. In a test with two children, Aragno said he: \nasked the boy to go to the kitchen on my right, and the right camera followed him and the left stayed, so the 3D broke. The girl is in your left eyes and the boy on the right. When he was in the kitchen, your brain didn't know how to watch. It hurts to watch a little, but it was interesting, and when the boy comes back to the girl, the two cameras were again in classic 3D. So I showed it to Jean-Luc and he decided to use this for the film. \nAragno also experimented with the distance between the two cameras, sometimes moving them closer or farther away than the industry standard of six centimeters. Aragno later told \"the Huffington Post,\" \"I began thinking about making something in 3D that can only be in 3D ... 3D means two images, one left and one right, and both can be together, but you can also make one image different than the other.\"\n\nThis technique of separating the 3D image has been called a new shot in filmmaking, although it is partially comparable to shots in the first 3D feature film \"The Power of Love\". Calum Marsh of \"The Dissolve\" said that \"the vocabulary of the cinema has been enriched. There is a new tool available to filmmakers: a new technique, like the jump cut before it\", and that in his previous films Godard has \"been searching for a way to unify ideas—to join disparate images to create a new one. This shot is the realization.\" Erin Whitney of \"The Huffington Post\" wrote that \"The moment is so innovative and unusual that Godard and his cinematographer, Fabrice Aragno, didn't even have a name for it (Aragno has referred to the shot as \"separation,\" for lack of a better term).\" David Ehrlich of \"The Dissolve\" has described the technique as a \"choose your own adventure\" shot and wrote that \"by rendering the disparate images separate but simultaneous, Godard has found a way for viewers to compare separate images at the moment they see them. \"Goodbye To Language\" effectively argues that every cut is porous, and that seeing is just looking, if it's distracted by memory.\" Amy Taubin of \"Film Comment\" called the shot \"a mindboggling, eyeball-dislocating, narratively profound sequence\" and reported that after the shot concluded the audience erupted into applause at the film's premiere during the Cannes film festival. Jonathan Romney of \"Film Comment\" said that \"it's in-camera magic of a Méliès vintage: a piece of cheap trickery, but brilliantly and simply carried off, finding hitherto unsuspected delight in a simple 'improper' use of 3-D.\"\n\nAragno also experimented with 3D images in post-production. These included \"tests overlapping and combining 2-D and 3-D images. I wanted to 'encrust' different images and work on different planes in space\" and mixing different 2D images to create double exposure 3D images. Godard later used some of these tests in his short film \"Les Trois Désastres\", included in the 2013 omnibus film \"3X3D\".\n\n\"Goodbye to Language\" premiered on 21 May 2014, at the Lumière Theater in competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Godard was expected to attend the festival, but announced that he would not a few days before the screening. Godard told \"Radio Télévision Suisse\" that he did not want the Palme d'Or and would give it to his tax advisor if he won, just as he had done with his Honorary Oscar. Shortly afterwards he sent a video letter to retiring festival president Gilles Jacob and artistic director Thierry Frémaux explaining his absence from the festival and current state of mind. The video letter was intended to be private, but Jacob released it to the public as a short film called \"Letter in Motion to Gilles Jacob and Thierry Fremaux\". Main competition jury president Jane Campion said that \"the fact that he throws narrative away, it's like a poem. I found myself awakened. This was a free man.\" Amy Taubin attended the first screening and called the film a masterpiece, writing that it \"might be his most beautiful, Mozartian in its lightness, and unrestrained in communicating feelings about love.\" Manohla Dargis of the \"New York Times\" wrote that \"finally, the competition lineup had something it has desperately needed all week: a thrilling cinematic experience that nearly levitated the packed 2,300-seat Lumière theater here, turning just another screening into a real happening\" and called it \"deeply, excitingly challenging.\"\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Goodbye to Language \" has an approval rating of 88% based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"As visually thrilling as it is inscrutable, \"Goodbye to Language 3D\" offers a late-period masterpiece from a legendary director still very much in control of his craft.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".\n\nIn France, Isabelle Regnier of \"Le Monde\" called it \"a very beautiful film ... from a man who has given his life to cinema ... and profoundly changed the history of cinema.\" Gérard Lefort and Olivier Séguret of \"Libération\" praised both its \"a dazzling technical prowess\" and its mockery of the 3D process. Jean-Michel Frodon of \"Slate\" compared the results of the \"separation\" shots to a 1956 article Godard wrote for \"Cahiers du cinéma\" about the approximation of \"multiple images\" and said that Godard should receive a (non-existent) \"Nobel Prize in Cinema\" for putting his own theory into practice. Antoine De Baecque said that the film remained faithful to the ideals of the French New Wave by being \"absolutely contemporary\" and telling the truth of the modern age. Jean-Baptiste Doulcet of \"Benzine Magazine\" wrote that it \"has nothing to justify and will not be content to please\" and criticized its toilet humour and complexity, but called it \"light and sometimes touching!\" Éric Neuhoff of \"Le Figaro\" wrote that Godard was an \"old senile adolescent\" who had \"lost his inspiration\" and \"has learned nothing about love, the couple [or] society\", and mocked the film's fifteen-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDavid Bordwell called it \"the best new film I've seen this year, and the best 3D film I've ever seen.\" Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that the film's \"3-D technique is the first advance in deep-focus camerawork since the heyday of Orson Welles.\" Scott Foundas of \"Variety\" wrote that the film \"continually reaffirms that no single filmmaker has done more to test and reassert the possibilities of the moving image during the last half-century of the art form.\" In \"The New York Times\" A. O. Scott called it \"baffling and beautiful, a flurry of musical and literary snippets arrayed in counterpoint to a series of brilliantly colored and hauntingly evocative pictures.\" J. Hoberman of \"The New York Review of Books\" called it \"an exalted experience\" and said \"watching it is something like encountering motion pictures for the first time.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that watching it made him \"feel that I'm experiencing the real possibilities of 3-D for the first time.\" Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com said that \"Godard has recalibrated 3D into a revolutionary new investigative tool, a sensory marvel, and fittingly, the experience of watching 'Goodbye To Language' is akin to forcing your brain to experience a violent re-birth into a new age, one we haven't named yet.\" Blake Williams of \"Cinema Scope Magazine\" compared it to Stan Brakhage's \"Dog Star Man\" and Michael Snow's \"*Corpus Callosum\", calling it \"an 'avant-garde' work in the original and most literal sense of the term.\"\n\nSome reviews were negative. Thomas Lee of \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called it \"a mishmash of jumbled images, annoying jump cuts and pretentious philosophy/pseudo-psychobabble, the movie will no doubt appeal to hard-core fans of Godard ... But for the rest of us Americans who prefer some semblance of coherence and meaningful thought, 'Goodbye to Language' will sorely disappoint.\" Daniel Engber of \"Slate\" criticized the film's incoherent plot but praised its 3D innovations. Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" called it a \"snooze fest\" and wrote that Godard was \"a cranky 83-year-old bore pretentiously lecturing on cinema and the world in a private language only film critics and Upper West Side audiences pretend to understand at this point.\" Marc Mohan of \"The Oregonian\" called it \"a dense collage of sound and image, without a coherent narrative, that deconstructs cinema and history in provocative and often incomprehensible ways.\"\n\n\"Goodbye to Language\" was one of the most acclaimed films of 2014 and appeared on several critics' year-end best film lists. Critics who listed the film as the best film of the year include Carlo Chatrian, Scott Foundas, J. Hoberman, John Powers, James Quandt, Jean-François Rauger, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Dan Sullivan, Amy Taubin, Armond White, and Blake Williams. The staffs of \"Cahiers du cinéma\", \"Film Comment\" and the British Film Institute's \"Sight & Sound\" all listed it as 2nd place. Other critics who listed it as one of the year's best films include Kong Rithdee, Michael Atkinson, Richard Brody, David Ehrenstein, Dennis Lim, Richard Corliss, Glenn Kenny, Mathieu Macheret, Jonathan Romney, Molly Haskell, Miriam Bale, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, Manohla Dargis and Michael Phillips, and the staffs of \"Reverse Shot\", \"The Village Voice\", \"Indiewire\", \"CineVue\" and \"The A.V. Club\".\n\nAt the 2014 National Society of Film Critics Awards it was voted Best Picture. Godard came in second place for Best Director and Aragno came in third place for Best Cinematography. In France it was nominated for the 2014 Louis Delluc Prize, but lost to \"Clouds of Sils Maria\". In 2016, it was voted the 49th best film of the 21st century as picked by 177 film critics from around the world.\n\nAt the 2014 Cannes Film Festival it won the Jury Prize, which it shared with Xavier Dolan's \"Mommy\". Godard's dog Roxy won the Prix special Palm Dog Award. It was later screened at such festivals as the 2014 Locarno International Film Festival in the \"Fuori concorso\" section, 2014 Toronto International Film Festival in the \"Masters\" section, and the 2014 New York Film Festival.\n\nIt premiered in Paris at an advanced screening at Le Panthéon theatre on 24 May 2014. It was theatrically released in France on 28 May by Wild Bunch and sold 33,225 total tickets. It was distributed in North America by Kino Lorber, which released a 3D Blu-ray DVD in 2015. It premiered in the US at the New York Film Festival on 27 September 2014 and released theatrically on 29 October. It earned $27,000 on its opening weekend at two theaters, earning the highest per screen average of the weekend. It earned $390,099 in the US.\n\nMany film critics have complained that \"Goodbye to Language\" is difficult to understand. Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that \"there are only fragments of thoughts, nothing is developed.\" Charles Ealy of \"Austin 360\" compared it to watching Mike Myers's \"Sprockets\" sketch from \"Saturday Night Live\". Bordwell has criticized other reviewers' shallow analysis of the film, stating that \"critics put off by Godard, I think, have too limited a notion of what criticism is.\"\n\nBordwell has called the film opaque with characters that are difficult to interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses ellipses in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still heard. These techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes \"we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. They remind us of storytelling conventions we take for granted, and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them.\" Bordwell believes that \"blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what we see and hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed to savor each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting.\"\n\nThis \"opaque\" technique has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that when viewing a Godard film there are moments when one has the tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp something and you feel like you are losing your footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.\n\nWhen asked about the film's message, Godard rejected the premise of the question and contended, \"rather, it would be the message of the absence of a message. It's a message in everyday life.\" Colin MacCabe wrote that the film has no story: Instead there are patterns of images and sound overlaid with quotations from the authors ... There is the concern with history, above all Hitler and Nazism, and the understanding of history as making no distinction between image and reality, so that the history of the cinema and the history of the modern world wind in and out of each other.\n\nThe film's title has a double meaning. In Vaud, the French-speaking part of Switzerland where Godard was raised and currently lives, the word \"adieu\" can mean both goodbye and hello \"according to the time of day, the tone of voice.\" Godard has acknowledged that this interpretation would only be understood in Vaud and said \"nowadays, it seems that talking has nothing to do, that speech no longer exists.\" He believes that words are losing all meaning and that \"we are missing the point ... when I say 'Farewell' to language, it really means 'Farewell', meaning to say goodbye to my own way of speaking.\" However Godard believes that images, like films that mix words and visuals, are still capable of meaningful communication, citing Islamic and Christian prohibitions of certain images while allowing words as an example. Godard said that in the sequence with Mary Shelley and himself painting with watercolors he wanted to visually show the physical acts of the language of writing and the language of visual art. Bordwell believes that a theme of the film is \"the idea that language alienates us from some primordial connection to things.\"\n\nGodard became interested in 3D because \"it is still an area where there are no rules\" and thought it was not interesting because it had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, \"reveal[s] something cultural\", such as what it \"mean[s] about the times it emerged from\" and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as CinemaScope, dolly shots, close-ups or high fidelity are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by Auguste and Louis Lumière and D. W. Griffith, who made films before there were \"rules\" about technique, stating \"when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules.\" His inspiration came from the invention of perspective in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something \"beyond the frame.\" Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that repeat with two different couples. Godard was following Alfred Hitchcock's theory that \"when you want something to be understood, you say it at least twice.\"\n\nBryant Frazer of \"Studio Daily\" wrote that Godard breaks the conventional \"rules\" of 3D in five ways: \"he does not keep a clean frame\" in his screen compositions, \"he embraces low-quality cameras\", \"he gravitates toward deep focus\" cinematography, \"he rips the 3D image apart and then restores it in a single shot\" and \"he uses stereo to elevate the mundane\" instead of spectacular subjects like superhero or fantasy films. Frazer said that Godard \"wants to experiment with the technology, draw attention to it, test its boundaries, and see what happens when the image falls apart completely.\" Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that \"rather than using 3-D as an effect to create a sensation of flight or to make a viewer feel like the target of propelled objects, Godard uses 3-D to emphasize the materiality, the physical properties, of the world at hand.\" Bordwell said that, other than \"to awe us with special effects\", 3D's purposes are typically to be realistic in its enhancement of the depth of objects and \"advancing our understanding of the story\", which is usually achieved with only one part of the screen in 3D while the rest is out of focus and in 2D. In \"Goodbye to Language\" Godard uses 3D in deep focus shots with images that allow the audience to scan the entire frame. Bordwell wrote that Godard's use of 3D \"is aiming to make us perceive the world stripped of our conceptual constructs (language, plot, normal viewpoints, and so on).\"\n\nBrody wrote that Godard \"treated 3-D as a device of independent filmmaking ... he opens the art form up to yet another, virtual dimension. His use of 3-D is itself the film's big idea.\" MacCabe wrote that Godard \"uses [3D] to distance as well as engage\" the audience instead of simply enhancing realism, which is influenced by Bertolt Brecht. Armond White wrote that Godard \"uses the digital 3D fad to consider how men and women communicate ... and then, playfully, observes their dog's loyalty ... to demonstrate pure faith, pure curiosity, and his own imperviousness in an era when Reality and Digital Reality are confused.\" White believes that the film's use of 3D mocks the technique's supposed visual depth and instead uses it to examine the depth of human experience, such as \"the dynamics of sexual, political, and artistic relations.\"\n\nRoxy Miéville appears with the couple, as well as with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his long-term professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of \"Libération\" observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard \"trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of an unspoiled way ... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh.\" Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes and that Roxy \"restores balance\" to the couple when they are in conflict and represent \"the commoners\" while the couple represents \"nobility\" or \"the clergy.\" MacCabe wrote that Roxy \"offer[s] an image of acceptable sociality\" in the film. In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, which Brody calls \"Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism. It's as if Roxy were the agent of reconciliation—not of one merely lover to another but of Godard to the present day, to the rising generation.\"\n\nJonathan Romney expressed his difficulty in jotting down each reference while watching the film, writing that \"propositions, allusions, sounds, images rush on in wave after wave, each building a new layer on top of—or violently erasing—what's immediately gone before. Trying to make any sense of it all, even in the most rudimentary or provisional way, is an anguish-inducing process\" and that \"you might be closer to understanding a Godard film if you'd read everything the director had read—but then you'd also have to have read it all \"in exactly\" the same way that he had read it, making the same connections.\" Ted Fendt wrote that \"knowing the original sources of Godard's work often seems to me to be about as useful to 'unlocking' the films and videos as reading a heavily footnoted copy of \"The Waste Land\".\"\n\nBrody has observed that many of the references have been used by Godard in his previous film, making them \"self-referential and retrospective touches.\" He also relates the visual references to the political themes of the film and compares the archival footage of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in the first part as parallel to the scenes from classic films on TV screens in the second part. The historical footage \"seem[s] to persist as an outsized influence on today's politics, stories, and even identities\" while the Hollywood movies compel modern film characters to \"live in the light of the history of cinema, of the great age of Hollywood and the classic European cinema that also overarches and overawes the moderns.\" One technique Godard uses is having narrative scenes suddenly cut to \"a digression, a collage of found footage, intertitles, or other material that seems triggered by something mentioned in the scene.\" Bordwell has called this an \"associational form\" often used in essay films, similar to novelist John Dos Passos' use of newspaper stories in his \"USA trilogy\".\n\nThe film examines many historical events of the twentieth century, particularly the rise of Hitler, communism and technology. Godard quotes lengthy passages from Jacques Ellul's 1945 essay \"Victoire d'Hitler?\" In this essay Ellul wrote \"everything Hitler said, he accomplished\" and examined the dangers of the individual giving absolute power to the State. Ellul concluded that \"everything that the State conquers as a power, it never loses. And that's Hitler's second victory.\" Eric Kohn of \"Indiewire\" wrote that showing Ellul's essay being read off of a smart phone \"portrays the information age as the dying breath of consciousness before intellectual thought becomes homogenized by digital advancements\" and that the film \"suggests humankind has grown limited by devices that tell us everything we think we need to know.\"\n\nThere are also brief references to Africa, such as Joceyln Benoist's quote: \"Sir, is it possible to produce a concept about Africa?\" Brody said this reference \"suggests the poverty of modern philosophy—and of modern art—in addressing political crises that were wrongly relegated to the margins of the twentieth century and that have recently come to the fore.\" White believes that the film's reference to \"Frankenstein\" is a \"prophesy of the 21st century compulsion to debase ourselves into monsters and zombies—confused by the need to make sense of topical complexities. Our guilt-ridden age's retreat into a technology that pretends realism rather than moral imagination is pathetic.\" Brody interpreted the reference as a suggestion \"that the book itself is an act of political metaphor and historical image creation.\" MacCabe wrote that the film is Godard's most intense example of the director's increasing \"extreme Calvinism\", writing that \"it is difficult not to feel that the film is, among other things, the work of an old Protestant pastor fulminating against the sins of the world and the irredeemable fallenness of man.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2857916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2857916", "title": "Harvey Mansfield", "text": "Harvey Mansfield\n\nHarvey Claflin Mansfield Jr. (born March 21, 1932) is an American political philosopher. He is the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Government at Harvard University, where he has taught since 1962. He has held Guggenheim and NEH Fellowships and has been a Fellow at the National Humanities Center; he also received the National Humanities Medal in 2004 and delivered the Jefferson Lecture in 2007. He is a Carol G. Simon Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. He is notable for his generally conservative stance on political issues in his writings.\n\nMansfield is the author and co-translator of studies of and/or by major political philosophers such as Aristotle, Edmund Burke, Niccolò Machiavelli, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Thomas Hobbes, of Constitutional government, and of \"Manliness\" (2006). In interviews Mansfield has acknowledged the work of Leo Strauss as the key modern influence on his own political philosophy.\n\nAmong his most notable former students include: Charles R. Kesler, Mark Blitz, Tom Cotton, Andrew Sullivan, Alan Keyes, William Kristol, Clifford Orwin, Paul Cantor, Delba Winthrop, Mark Lilla, Francis Fukuyama, and Shen Tong.\n\nMansfield's father, Harvey Mansfield Sr., was the Ruggles Professor Emeritus of Public Law and Government at Columbia University at the time of his death in 1988 at the age of 83. Mansfield has been at Harvard since his own student days in 1949, having joined the faculty in 1962. He received his A.B. at Harvard in 1953, served in the United States Army in Virginia and France, and then received his Ph.D. from Harvard 1961. \n\nMansfield was married to the late Delba Winthrop, with whom he co-translated and co-authored work on Tocqueville.\n\nIn his 2001 book \"A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy\", Mansfield traces the history of political philosophy in \"the great books\" written by Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, and others of the \"highest rank\" (1). He also finds political philosophy in practical politics, which Mansfield considers necessarily partisan, because it involves citizens \"arguing passionately pro and con with advocacy and denigration, accusation and defense\" (2). He argues that politics does not merely consist of liberal and conservative options, but rather, they are fundamentally opposed to each other, with each side defending its own interest as it attempts to appeal to the common good (2). Since such adversarial sides in a political dispute appeal to the common good, an observer of the dispute can use his capacity to reason to judge which side supplies the most compelling arguments. If such an observer is competent to be a judge, he or she may be thought of as a political philosopher, or as at least on the way to engaging in political philosophy (2–3).\n\nMansfield stresses the connection between politics and political philosophy, but he does not find political philosophy in political science, which for Mansfield is a rival to political philosophy and \"apes\" the natural sciences (3–5). From Mansfield's point of view, political science replaces words like \"good\", \"just\", and \"noble\" with other words like \"utility\" or \"preferences.\" The terms are meant to be neutral, but as a result of the political scientist's purported change of role and perspective from judge to so‑called \"disinterested observer\", such a \"scientist\" is not able to determine whose arguments are the best, because he or she falls victim to relativism, which, according to Mansfield, is \"a sort of lazy dogmatism\" (4–5).\n\nIn his guide, Mansfield reminds students that political science rebelled from political philosophy in the seventeenth century and declared itself distinct and separate in the positivist movement of the late nineteenth century: thus, he argues in it that whereas \"Today political science is often said to be 'descriptive' or 'empirical,' concerned with facts; political philosophy is called 'normative' because it expresses values. But these terms merely repeat in more abstract form the difference between political science, which seeks agreement, and political philosophy, which seeks the best\" (6).\n\nFurthermore, according to Mansfield, when people talk about the difference between political philosophy and political science, they are actually talking about two distinct kinds of political philosophy, one modern and the other ancient. The only way to understand modern political science and its ancient alternative fully, he stresses, is to enter the history of political philosophy, and to study the tradition handed down over the centuries: \"No one can count himself educated who does not have some acquaintance with this tradition. It informs you of the leading possibilities of human life, and by giving you a sense of what has been tried and what is now dominant, it tells you \"where we are now\" in a depth not available from any other source\" (7–8). Although modern political science feels no obligation to look at its roots, and might even denigrate the subject as if it could not be of any real significance, he says, \"our reasoning shows that the history of political philosophy is required for understanding its substance\" (7–8).\n\nIn response to multiculturalism on college campuses, Mansfield has defended the importance of preserving and teaching courses on Western civilization, even proposing a survey course that selects a dozen or so books that capture the principal themes. Mansfield believes that understanding Western civilization is important because the books that explain it deal with problems associated with the human condition.\nMansfield has argued that the President of the United States has \"extra-legal powers such as commanding the military, making treaties (and carrying on foreign policy), and pardoning the convicted, not to mention a veto of legislation\", observing that the U.S. Constitution does not ask the President to take an oath to execute the laws, but rather, to execute \"the \"office\" of the president, which is larger.\" Referring to domestic surveillance, Mansfield notes, \"those arguing that the executive should be subject to checks and balances are wrong to say or imply that the president may be checked in the sense of stopped. The president can be held accountable and made responsible, but if he could be stopped, the Constitution would lack any sure means of emergency action. He defends the separation of powers, arguing that \"the executive subordinated to the rule of law is in danger of being subordinate to the legislature.\"\n\nIn his book \"Taming the Prince\", Mansfield traces the modern doctrine of executive power to Niccolò Machiavelli. He argues that executive power had to be tamed to become compatible with liberal constitutionalism.\nIn his 2006 book \"Manliness\", Mansfield defended a moderately conservative understanding of gender roles, and bemoaned the loss of the virtue of manliness in a \"gender neutral\" society. In a \"New York Times\" interview, he defined the concept briefly as \"confidence in a situation of risk. A manly man has to know what he is doing.\" He defines the idea in more concrete terms in the book. There, a manly man does not have to know what he is doing, but only has to act as though he does. Also in the book, Mansfield subjects the concept of manliness to a test in which he refers for support of his argument to such diverse authorities as Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Rudyard Kipling, Ernest Hemingway, and Naomi Wood. In his argument, manliness is ultimately related to assertiveness—\"decisiveness without complete knowledge\"—and its place in society is debated. In an interview with Bill Kristol, Mansfield said, \"What I wrote was a modest defense of manliness. And the emphasis [is] on modest because manliness can be bad as well as good. Not everyone who takes risks deserves to have them turn out right and so manliness is, I think, responsible for a lot of evil. You can say that terrorists are manly, they’re willing to risk their lives and give their lives for a principle they believe in or a point they believe in.\"\n\n\"Manliness\" was criticized by Martha Nussbaum in the June 22, 2006, issue of \"The New Republic.\" Nussbaum accuses Mansfield of misreading, or refusing to read, many feminist and nonfeminist texts. She argues that his book is based on overt misogynistic assumptions that take a position of indifference towards violence against women. Mansfield asserts, she contends, that a woman can resist rape only with the aid of \"a certain ladylike modesty enabling her to take offense at unwanted encroachment\".\n\nConcerning controversial comments by former President of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, about mental differences between men and women, Mansfield said that it is \"probably true\" that women \"innately have less capacity than men at the highest level of science...It's common sense if you just look at who the top scientists are\".\n\nIn 1993, Mansfield testified on behalf of Colorado's Amendment 2, which amended the state constitution to prevent gays, lesbians and bisexuals from pursuing legal claims of discrimination. In his testimony, he argued that being gay \"is not a life that makes for happiness,\" that homosexuality is \"shameful,\" and that by not being able to have children gay people were not \"socially responsible.\" Nussbaum, who testified in the same trial against Amendment 2, later remarked that Mansfield's source for his claim that gay and lesbian people were unhappy was not contemporary social science research but the great books of the Western tradition (Plato, Tocqueville, Rousseau, etc.).\n\nMansfield has voiced criticism of grade inflation at Harvard University, which he claims is due in part to affirmative action. Mansfield also participated in a debate on affirmative action between Cornel West and Michael Sandel (arguing for affirmative action) with Ruth Wisse and himself (arguing against affirmative action). The debate attracted a \"massive audience\" of a thousand Harvard students, requiring its campus venue to be changed twice before it could take place on November 3, 1997, in Harvard's Sanders Theater, prompting Professor Sandel to comment, \"'This puts to rest the myth that this generation has a political apathy, and apathy to political debates.'\" In 2013, Mansfield, after hearing from a dean that \"the most frequent grade is an A\", claimed to give students two grades: one for their transcript, and the one he thinks they deserve. He commented, \"I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade\".\n\nIn response to grade inflation, according to \"Harvard Crimson\" reporters Lulu Zhou and Rebecca D. O'Brien, Mansfield revived the \"ironic\" (or the \"inflated\") grade in 2006, in order to let his students know what they really deserved in his class without causing them harm by grading them lower than the other professors at Harvard: \"In Mansfield’s 'true and serious' grading system, 5 percent of students will receive A’s, and 15 percent will receive A-minuses. But Mansfield won’t share those marks with anyone other than his teaching fellows and students. ... By contrast, Mansfield’s 'ironic' grade—the only one that will appear on official transcripts—will follow average grade distribution in the College, with about a quarter of students receiving A’s and another quarter receiving A-minu[s]es\"; in contrast, their privately received deserved \"real\" (lower) grades usually centered around a C or C-minus, earning him the nickname \"Harvey C-minus Mansfield.\" \"This [grading] policy—meant to demonstrate the causes and effects of grade inflation—drew heat from students and faculty, and attracted national media attention.\" Mansfield himself has joked that his middle initial \"C.\" stands for compassion: \"That's what I lack when it comes to grading.\" In an interview with the Hoover Institution, Mansfield claimed that college professors are too quick to label students as exceptional.\nOn May 8, 2007, Mansfield delivered the 36th Jefferson Lecture (\"the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished intellectual and public achievement in the humanities\", according to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which sponsored the lecture). In his lecture, Mansfield suggests \"two improvements for today’s understanding of politics arising from the humanities ... first ... to recapture the notion of thumos in Plato, and Aristotle... [and] ...second ... the use of names—proper to literature and foreign to science\".\n\nThis is a reference to his own philosophy, which forbids discounting the wisdom of the past simply because those who spoke it lived a long time ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1105355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1105355", "title": "I and Thou", "text": "I and Thou\n\nIch und Du, usually translated as I and Thou(You), is a book by Martin Buber, published in 1923, and first translated from German to English in 1937.\n\nBuber's main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways:\nOne of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. In Buber's view, all of our relationships bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou.\n\nBuber explains that humans are defined by two word pairs: \"I-It\" and \"I-Thou\".\n\nThe \"It\" of \"I-It\" refers to the world of experience and sensation. \"I-It\" describes entities as discrete objects drawn from a defined set (e.g., he, she or any other objective entity defined by what makes it measurably different from other entities). It can be said that \"I\" have as many distinct and different relationships with each \"It\" as there are \"Its\" in one's life. Fundamentally, \"It\" refers to the world as we experience it.\n\nBy contrast, the word pair \"I-Thou\" describes the world of relations. This is the \"I\" that does not objectify any \"It\" but rather acknowledges a living relationship. \"I-Thou\" relationships are sustained in the spirit and mind of an \"I\" for however long the feeling or idea of relationship is the dominant mode of perception. A person sitting next to a complete stranger on a park bench may enter into an \"I-Thou\" relationship with the stranger merely by beginning to think positively about people in general. The stranger is a person as well, and gets instantaneously drawn into a mental or spiritual relationship with the person whose positive thoughts necessarily include the stranger as a member of the set of persons about whom positive thoughts are directed. It is not necessary for the stranger to have any idea that he is being drawn into an \"I-Thou\" relationship for such a relationship to arise. But what is crucial to understand is the word pair \"I-Thou\" can refer to a relationship with a tree, the sky, or the park bench itself as much as it can refer to the relationship between two individuals. The essential character of \"I-Thou\" is the abandonment of the world of sensation, the melting of the between, so that the relationship with another \"I\" is foremost.\n\nBuber's two notions of \"I\" require attachment of the word \"I\" to a word partner. The splitting into the individual terms \"I\" and \"it\" and \"thou\" is only for the purposes of analysis. Despite the separation of \"I\" from the \"It\" and \"Thou\" in this very sentence describing the relationship, there is to Buber's mind either an \"I-Thou\" or an \"I-It\" relationship. Every sentence that a person uses with \"I\" refers to the two pairs: \"I-Thou\" and \"I-It\", and likewise \"I\" is implicit in every sentence with \"Thou\" or \"It\". Each It is bounded by others and It can only exist through this attachment because for every object there is another object. Thou, on the other hand, has no limitations. When \"Thou\" is spoken, the speaker has no thing (has nothing), hence, Thou is abstract; yet the speaker “takes his stand in relation”.\n\nWhat does it mean to experience the world? One goes around the world extracting knowledge from the world in experiences betokened by \"He\", \"She\", and \"It\". One also has \"I-Thou\" relationships. Experience is all physical, but these relationships involve a great deal of spirituality. The twofold nature of the world means that our being in the world has two aspects: the aspect of experience, which is perceived as I-It, and the aspect of relation, which is perceived as I-Thou.\n\nBuber uses an example of a tree and presents five separate relations:\nThrough all of these relations, the tree is still an object that occupies time and space and still has the characteristics that make it what it is.\n\nIf \"Thou\" is used in the context of an encounter with a human being, the human being is not He, She, or bound by anything. You do not \"experience\" the human being; rather you can only relate to him or her in the sacredness of the I-Thou relation. The I-Thou relationship cannot be explained; it simply is. Nothing can intervene in the I-Thou relationship. I-Thou is not a means to some object or goal, but a definitive relationship involving the whole being of each subject.\n\nLike the I-Thou relation, love is a subject-to-subject relationship. Love is not a relation of subject to object, but rather a relation in which both members in the relationship are subjects and share the unity of being.\n\nThe ultimate Thou is God. In the I-Thou relation there are no barriers. This enables us to relate directly to God. God is ever-present in human consciousness, manifesting in music, literature, and other forms of culture. Inevitably, Thou is addressed as It, and the I-Thou relation becomes the being of the I-Thou relation. God is now spoken to directly, not spoken about.\n\nThere is no world that disconnects one from God, a world of It alone, when I-Thou guides one’s actions. \"One who truly meets the world goes out also to God.\" God is the worldwide relation to all relations.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "744158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=744158", "title": "Jnana yoga", "text": "Jnana yoga\n\nJñāna yoga, also known as Jnanamarga, is one of the several spiritual paths in Hinduism that emphasizes the \"path of knowledge\", also known as the \"path of self-realization\". It is one of the three classical paths (\"margas\") for moksha (salvation, liberation). The other two are karma yoga (path of action, \"karmamarga\") and bhakti yoga (path of loving devotion to a personal god, \"bhaktimarga\"). Later, new movements within Hinduism added raja yoga as a fourth spiritual path, but it is not universally accepted as distinct to the other three.\n\nThe \"jnana yoga\" is a spiritual practice that pursues knowledge with questions such as \"who am I, what am I\" among others. The practitioner studies usually with the aid of a counsellor (guru), meditates, reflects, and reaches liberating insights on the nature of his own Self (Atman, soul) and its relationship to the metaphysical concept called Brahman in Hinduism. The \"jnanamarga\" ideas are discussed in ancient and medieval era Hindu scriptures and texts such as the \"Upanishads\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\nJñāna in Sanskrit means \"knowledge\". The root jñā- is cognate to English \"know\", as well as to the Greek γνώ- (as in γνῶσις \"gnosis\"). Its antonym is \"ajñāna\" \"ignorance\".\n\n\"Jnana\" is knowledge, and refers to any cognitive event that is correct and true over time. It particularly refers to knowledge inseparable from the total experience of its object, especially about reality (non-theistic schools) or supreme being (theistic schools). In Hinduism, it is knowledge which gives Moksha, or spiritual release while alive (jivanmukti) or after death (videhamukti). According to Bimal Matilal, \"jnana yoga\" in Advaita Vedanta connotes both primary and secondary sense of its meaning, that is \"self-consciousness, awareness\" in the absolute sense and relative \"intellectual understanding\" respectively.\n\nAccording to Jones and Ryan, \"jnana\" in \"jnana yoga\" context is better understood as \"realization or gnosis\", referring to a \"path of study\" wherein one knows the unity between self and ultimate reality called Brahman in Hinduism. This explanation is found in the ancient Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nJñāna yoga is the path towards attaining \"jnana\". It is one of the three classical types of yoga mentioned in Hindu philosophies, the other two being karma yoga and bhakti. In modern classifications, classical yoga, being called Raja yoga, is mentioned as a fourth one, an extension introduced by Vivekananda. Jnana yoga, states Stephen Phillips, is the \"yoga of meditation\".\n\nOf the three different paths to liberation, \"jnana marga\" and \"karma marga\" are the more ancient, traceable to Vedic era literature. All three paths are available to any Hindu, chosen based on inclination, aptitude and personal preference, and typically elements of all three to varying degrees are practiced by many Hindus.\n\nThe classical yoga emphasizes the practice of dhyana (meditation), and this is a part of all three classical paths in Hinduism, including \"jñāna yoga\". The path of knowledge is intended for those who prefer philosophical reflection and it requires study and meditation.\n\nIn the Upanishads, \"'jnana yoga\" aims at the realization of the oneness of the individual self (Atman) and the ultimate Self (Brahman). These teachings are found in the early Upanishads. According to Chambliss, the mystical teachings within these Upanishads discuss \"the way of knowledge of the Self\", a union, the realization that the Self (Atman) and the Brahman are identical.\n\nThe teachings in the Upanishads have been interpreted in a number of ways, ranging from non-theistic monism to theistic dualism. In former, rituals are not necessary and a path of introspection and meditation is emphasized for the correct knowledge (\"jnana\") of self. In latter, it is the full and correct knowledge of a Vishnu avatar or Shiva or Shakti (Goddess) that is emphasized. In all its various interpretations, the paths are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A \"Jnana yogi\" may also practice \"Karma yoga\" or \"Bhakti yoga\" or both, and differing levels of emphasis.\n\nAccording to Robert Roeser, the precepts of \"Jnana yoga\" in Hinduism were likely systematized by about 500 BCE, earlier than \"Karma yoga\" and \"Bhakti yoga\".\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, \"jnana yoga\" is also referred to as \"buddhi yoga\" and its goal is self-realization. The text considers \"jnana marga\" as the most difficult, slow, confusing for those who prefer it because it deals with \"formless reality\", the \"avyakta\". It is the path that intellectually oriented people tend to prefer.\n\nThe chapter 4 of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" is dedicated to the general exposition of \"jnana yoga\", while chapters 7 and 16 discuss its theological and axiological aspects. Krishna says that jñāna is the purest, and a discovery of one's Atman:\n\nThe Advaita philosopher Adi Shankarar gave primary importance to jñāna yoga for the \"knowledge of the absolute\" (Brahman), while the Vishishtadvaita commentator Ramanujar regarded knowledge only as a condition of devotion.\n\nClassical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga to attain moksha. It consists of fourfold attitudes, or behavioral qualifications:\n\n\"Jnanayoga\" for Advaitins consists of three practices: \"sravana\" (hearing), \"manana\" (thinking) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation). This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\":\n\nThese practices, with the help of a guru are believed to lead to correct knowledge, which destroys \"avidya\", psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman.\n\nBoth the theistic and monistic streams of Shaivism include \"jnana yoga\" ideas, along with those related to \"karma yoga\", and in the case of Saiva Siddhanta ideas related to \"bhakti yoga\". The Shaivism traditions do not consider renunciation necessary for practicing jnana yoga, leaving ascetic yogi lifestyle optional. Spirituality can be pursued along with active life (\"karma\"), according to Shaiva traditions, and it believes that this does not hinder ones ability to journey towards self (Shiva within) realization. The traditions dwell into this integration of karma yoga with jnana yoga, such as by ranking daily behavior and activity that is done by choice and when not necessary as higher in spiritual terms than activity that is impulsive or forced.\n\nThe methodology of sravana, manana and nididhyasana similar to Advaita Vedanta are also found in various traditions of Shaivism. However, \"nistha\" or \"samadhi\" is sometimes added in Shaiva methodology. The meditational aspects of Shaivism focus on the nirguna form of Supreme Reality (Shiva).\n\nThe \"Pancharatra\" (agama) texts of Vaishnavism, along with its Bhagavata (Krishna, Rama, Vishnu) tradition, are strongly influenced by \"jnana yoga\" ideas of the Upanishads. However, Vaishnavism also incorporates Bhakti yoga concepts of loving devotion to the divine Supreme personally selected by the devotee, in saguna form, both in silent meditational and musical expressive styles.\n\nThe aim of jnana yoga in Vaishnavism differs from that in other schools. Advaita, for example, considers jnana yoga as the path to nondual self-knowledge and moksha. Vaishnavism, in contrast, considers it a condition of devotion.\n\nThe Shaktism literature on goddess such as \"Kularnava Tantra\" highlight \"jnana marga\" as important to liberation. It differentiates between two kings of \"jnana\": one it calls knowledge that comes from Agama texts, and another it calls \"viveka\" (insight). The Shaktism literature then adds that both lead to the knowledge of Brahman, but the first one is in the form of sound (\"shabdabrahman\"), while the insight from within is the ultimate truth (\"parabrahman\").\n\nSome Shakta texts, such as the \"Sita Upanishad\", combine yoga of action and knowledge as a path to liberation. The \"Devi Gita\", a classic text of Shaktism, dedicates chapter 4 to \"Jnana yoga\", stating that a Jnana yogi understands and realizes that there is no difference between the individual soul and herself as the supreme Self. The discussion of Jnana yoga continues through the later chapters of the \"Devi Gita\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4887471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4887471", "title": "Jo Gwangjo", "text": "Jo Gwangjo\n\nJo Gwangjo (, 23 August 1482 – 10 January 1520), also often called by his pen name Jeong-am (), was Korean Neo-Confucian scholar who pursued radical reforms during the reign of Jungjong of Joseon in the early 16th century.\n\nHe was framed with charges of factionalism by the power elite that opposed his reform measures and was sentenced to drink poison in the Third Literati Purge of 1519. He has been widely venerated as a Confucian martyr and an embodiment of \"seonbi spirit\" by later generations in Korea. Some historians consider him one of the most influential figures in 16th century Korea. He's one of the 18 Sages of Korea () and honored as Munmyo Baehyang ().\n\nJo Gwangjo was the son of Jo Wongang (조원강, 趙元綱) and was from the Hanyang Jo clan (한양조씨, 漢陽趙氏). Jo studied under neo-Confucian scholar Kim Gwoeng-pil, Kim Jong-jik's disciple who was in exile at the time following the First Literati Purge of 1498. When Kim Gwoeng-pil was later executed (by poison) following the Second Literati Purge of 1504, Jo was exiled for being Kim's disciple.\n\nAt this time, Joseon Dynasty politics was primarily marked by power struggle between two aristocratic yangban factions - the established \"Hungu\" power elites who were generally conservative and the upstart Sarim scholars called seonbis, who belonged to neo-Confucian school of Kim Jong-jik and other thinkers. Sarim faction had entered the court politics during the reign of King Seongjong but suffered two bloody purges under his successor Yeonsangun. When Yeonsangun was eventually deposed in 1506, Jungjong was placed on the throne as the eleventh king of Joseon by the Hungu leaders who led the coup. For first ten years of his reign, Jungjong could not truly rule the country with regal authority (he was forced to depose his faithful queen because her father was killed by the coup leaders, and they feared that the queen might take revenge.) However, three main coup leaders died of natural causes by then, and Jungjong began to welcome Sarim scholars to his court to check Hungu faction's power. The Sarim faction considered Hungu faction as a whole as greedy and corrupt men unworthy of respect and sought to establish ideal neo-Confucian society. (Indeed, many of coup leaders had enjoyed Yeonsangun's favor during most of his reign, and their chief Park Won-jong led the coup mainly for personal revenge for his sister was raped by Yeonsangun.)\n\nJo Gwangjo came from a prominent family that belonged to Hungu faction but was called \"crazy man\" and \"source of disaster\" by people around him for studying neo-Confucianism under exiled Sarim scholar Kim Gwoeng-pil at the height of persecution of the Sarim faction. In 1510, Jo Gwangjo passed the Gwageo exam and became a student at Royal Academy called Seonggyungwan. He was often recommended for a court position by high officials and fellow students at Seonggyngwan, but he delayed entering civil service to pursue further study until 1515, when he was recommended to King Jungjong by Minister of Personnel Ahn Dang and 200 Seonggyungwan students and was immediately appointed to a position of junior sixth rank. However, he was ashamed to take office with others' help and took Al-seung-si exam, and his essay caught Jungjong's attention.\n\nBy then, Jo was already known for unbending and outspoken character as he soon emerged as the leader of Sarim faction. For instance, when he became a jung-un, lowest position at Office of Censors, the first thing he did on the following day was to petition the king to fire all his superiors at the Office of Censors and Office of Inspector General. At the time, two Sarim officials had petitioned the king to restore status of the deposed queen, who was deposed by Hungu faction. Office of Inspector General and Office of Censors had them exiled for their impertinent petition. Jo Gwangjo argued that two offices violated their given function by suppressing free speech and petitioned the king to fire his superiors or accept his resignation since he could not work with them. To the surprise of everyone, Jungjong replaced everyone in two offices except Jo. This event reflected Jungjong's complete trust and confidence in Jo, who rose in a series of unprecedented promotions from rank of junior sixth rank to junior second rank in only three years.\n\nKing Jungjong wanted to bring new talents to the royal court that was dominated by Hoon-gu faction, and Jo complied by introducing a new system of government recruitment via recommendations that were based on the candidates' moral character as well as scholarship. He argued that existing officer examination were too philosophical and placed too much emphasis on literary skills, detached from the practical needs of the government. The supplementary examination that Jo introduced was called an \"examination for the learned and the virtuous\" (\"hyeollanggwa\"). This was an abbreviated examination for candidates recommended by local magistrates as men of highest integrity in the presence of the king, who chose the winning candidates. This system allowed Jo to recruit many talented Sarim scholars who had been living secluded life in rural provinces. However, it also left him open to Hungu faction's attack that Jo formed a clique of his supporters by placing them in key positions.\n\nJo and his supporters then pushed forth a series of radical reforms as they established local self-government system called Hyang'yak to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit among people. In this system, deference was placed according to senority of villagers rather than their social status. The Sarim faction also sought to reduce gap between the rich and poor with a land reform that would distribute land to farmers equally and limit amount of land and number of slaves that one could own. This measure also targeted Hungu faction's accumulation of land and wealth.\n\nDeeply influenced by Zhu Xi's neo-Confucianism, Jo Gwangjo believed that ideal world of mythical Chinese Emperor Yao and Shun, could be achieved if all people from the king down to low-born became morally refined and followed Confucius' teachings. The Sarim faction therefore promulgated Confucian writings among the populace by translating them in Korean hangul and distributing them widely. They also suppressed Buddhism and Taoism as superstitious religions by destroying the royal Taoist temple and confiscating properties of Buddhist temples. \nAs Inspector General, he impeached many officials for corruption and bribery. According to Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, it was said that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because of such strict enforcement. He also sought to trim the size of government by reducing the number of bureaucrats and their wages. \nJo also believed that any talented people including slaves should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. He was said to judge people by moral character and did not greet superior officials if he considered them of unworthy characters while he was courteous even to his servants. For instance, he formed a friendship with a butcher/tanner of lowest class (baekjeong) who did not even have a name and admired his learning so much that he discussed state affairs with him and wanted to appoint him as a court official. But the tanner repeatedly refused Jo's offer and then disappeared without a trace according to Records of Yeonryeoshil (연려실기술), a collection of official and unofficial history books compiled by Yi Geung-ik in late Joseon Dynasty. (It is said that King Injong, Jungjong's successor who admired his tutor Jo Gwangjo, listed the \"tanner\" as Chief State Councillor for his future cabinet for he was greatly admired by Jo.) According to famous Korean philosopher Yi I, Jo was admired so much by populace that when he appeared on streets people gathered before him saying, \"Our master is coming.\" \n\nJo Gwangjo's radical reforms were popular with the populace, who called him the \"living Buddha\", but he faced fierce opposition and hostility from the Hungu faction. In early 1519, several Hungu officials began a plot to assassinate Sarim officials, though they were discovered in time. \nJo's power base was concentrated in four offices: Inspector General's Office (사헌부; whose main function was to impeach corrupt or unprincipled government officials in court and local administration), Office of Censors (사간원; whose role was to criticize wrong policies of the king or ministers), Hongmoongwan (홍문관; an advisory council that answered the king's questions and educated the king with history and Confucian philosophy), and Royal Secretariat (승정원; which served as liaison between the king and ministries). The first three offices were collectively called Three Offices, or Samsa (삼사), as they provided checks and balance on the power of the king and the ministers and also served as organ of press that influenced general opinion of the court. \nHowever, the Sarim faction did not control any army nor had financial base. Sarim's power was solely dependent on the king's support, which Jo believed to be steadfast in their mutual pursuit of reforms. However, Jo's unbending character and his frequent remonstrations to Jungjong to support his radical programs began to irritate the king. Even when he disagreed with Jo, Jungjong almost always ended up adopting Jo's petition because Jo would refuse to bend his will and Three Offices would threaten to resign en masse. Furthermore, Jo and Hongmoongwan officials often instructed Jungjong on the ways of king in long lessons. Because Jungjong was not a crown prince, he had not received a thorough royal education expected of future king, and Sarim scholars sought to rectify this, believing that only learning could prevent a despot like Yeonsangun. Jungjong began to feel hounded by his subjects and resented it.\n\nThe Hungu faction, which sensed Jungjong's irritation with Jo Gwangjo, found an opportunity to strike Sarim faction when Jo Gwangjo decided to go after the \"heroes\" of the 1506 coup that brought Jungjong to power. According to Jo, many officials who were awarded with special privileges including tax exemptions and huge stipends did not actually contribute much to the coup but gained their status through bribes or familial connections. He petitioned Jungjong to revoke such status from two thirds out of 110 people who received special status in connection with the coup. This move infuriated the Hungu faction, and they soon after proceeded to frame Jo Gwangjo with charges of disloyalty.\n\nAt the behest of Hungu leaders including Hong Kyung-ju, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, Consort Gyeong of Park clan and Consort Hui of Hong clan (Hong Kyung-ju's daughter) sought to estrange Jungjong and Jo Gwangjo by often questioning Jo's loyalty and claiming that popular support was shifting to Jo. They told Jungjong that people were saying that it was actually Jo Gwangjo who ruled the country and that populace wanted to make him their king. Even if Jo was not disloyal, he would not be able to stop his supporters from doing so, they said.\n\nAccording to Annals of Joseon Dynasty, Nam Gon now set out to slander Jo and wrote a phrase \"Ju cho will become the king\" (주초위왕, 走肖爲王)\" with honey or sugary water on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars left behind such phrase on leaves in the palace. When two Hanja (Chinese) characters \"ju\"(走) and \"cho\"(肖) are put together, they form a new Hanja character \"jo\"(趙), which happen to be Jo Gwangjo's family name. Consort Hong or Consort Park showed the leaf to Jungjong and claimed that this was the heaven's warning that Jo would take the throne himself after eliminating Hungu faction. Jungjong, who himself rose to the throne through a coup d'état, began to distrust Jo Gwangjo. [It should be noted that when Goryeo dynasty fell and was replaced by Joseon dynasty, there was popular saying \"Son of wood will gain the country\" (목자득국 木子得國). When two Hanja characters meaning wood(木) and son(子) are combined, they form a new character \"yi\"(李), which happens to be the family name of Yi Seoung-gye, who deposed the last king of Goryeo and founded Joseon dynasty. These phrases helped Yi Seoung-gye win popular support for the new dynasty as heaven's will.]\n\nWhen Jo petitioned Jungjong to revoke special privileges of people who falsely contributed to 1506 coup, Jungjong's suspicion was further heightened. Now feeling certain that Jungjong was sufficiently estranged from Jo, Hong Kyung-ju secretly entered the palace to warn King Jungjong that the court was filled with Jo's supporters and that no one could dare oppose him openly. Jungjong dispatched a secret letter to Hong Kyung-ju, expressing his fear that Jo Gwangjo would next go after Hungu officials who did contribute to the coup by questioning legitimacy of the coup and then turn against the king himself. Jungjong instructed Hoon-gu leaders to kill Jo Gwangjo and then inform him. On November 15, 1519, Hoon-gu leaders entered the palace secretly at night to bypass Royal Secretariat and present to the king written charges against Jo: he and his supporters \"deceived the king and put the state in disorder by forming a clique and abusing their positions to promote their supporters while excluding their opponents, and thereby misleading young people to make extremism into habit, causing the young to despise the old, the low-born to disrespect the high-born.\" Inspector General Jo Gwangjo, Justice Minister Kim Jung, and six others were immediately arrested, and they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial or even investigation. The whole event had appearance of coup d'état except that it was sanctioned by the king.\n\nThey would have been immediately killed except that War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who arrested Sarim officials, entreated that ministers should be consulted for such decision. The cabinet meeting on the following day regarding Jo's fate is described in detail in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. Most officials expressed their shock at Jo Gwangjo's arrest and Jungjong's intention to kill him. They entreated that he may have been extreme in his youthful zeal to improve the country but could not possibly have private agenda. Chief State Councillor Jeong Gwang-pil said in tears: \"I have frequently witnessed horrid calamities during the reign of deposed king (Yeonsangun), but how could I imagine to see such thing again even after meeting the wise king?\" When Jungjong tried to leave, he even grasped the royal cloth to entreat further. He \"could not understand on what charges the king wanted to punish them\" for \"mere demotion of 2-3 ranks would be already excessive.\" Eighteen younger officials requested to the king to imprison them with Jo Gwangjo. State Council and Six Ministries jointly entreated that punishing Jo and others on such charges without evidence would become a blot on the king's reputation. Even Hong Sook, who became Justice Minister overnight and interrogated Jo, reported to the king that he was \"deeply moved\" by Jo's loyalty.\n\nNew Inspector General Yu Eun, who replaced Jo, protested in even stronger terms: \"If Jo Gwangjo is guilty of crime, he should be punished in open and just manner... Instead, Your Majesty is handing out such punishment according to secret words by two people in the middle of night... What is so difficult about punishing few seonbis with authority of king that Your Majesty should do so covertly by sending a secret message?... If there is a crime, it should be dealt with clearly and justly, but Your Majesty appeared to trust and be friendly with them on the outside while thinking of eliminating them in mind.\" He was finally dismissed after asking Jungjong to \"cut my head to please the wicked people.\" \nMeanwhile, 150 Seonggyungwan students stormed the palace to protest Jo's arrest and filled the palace with shouts of entreaties, and later 240 students petitioned to claim Jo's innocence and requested to be imprisoned together. There was such popular outpouring for Jo's release that it may have increased Jungjong's suspicion and anger.\n\nJo Gwangjo was completely caught off guard with turn of the event. The Sarim faction had scored its biggest victory just four days ago when Jungjong granted their petition to revoke special status for 70 Hungu officials. He continued to believe that Jungjong was misled by his enemies and was confident that he could persuade the king of his loyalty once he could face him in the interrogation. He wrote to Jungjong of his fear for this incident becoming a bloody purge and entreated that he would not regret dying ten thousand times if only he could be granted an audience. However, he would never have a chance to see Jungjong again. Amid petitions for leniency, Jungjong commuted the death sentence to exile, and Jo Gwangjo was exiled to Neung-ju.\n\nNevertheless, Jungjong was determined to put Jo Gwangjo to death. In the Annals, there was no official demand for Jo's death, not even by Hong Kyung-joo, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, except for a petition by three Seunggyungwan students (as opposed to 300 who petitioned for his release). Nam Gon rather urged against executing Jo multiple times even as he was adding more and more names to the list of people to be purged through exile or dismissal. Yet Jungjong turned against Jo with the same intensity as when he favored him. He reinstated death sentence by poison for Jo less than a month after their exile. He fired many ministers who entreated on Jo's behalf including Chief State Councillor Jeong Gwang-pill, Deputy State Councillor Ahn Dang, and even War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who took part in arresting Sarim officials.\nJo Gwangjo still could not believe Jungjong's heart really turned against him and hoped to be recalled by the king, keeping a north door open each day during exile. Even when soldiers arrived with poison, he was suspicious that Hungu leaders might be trying to kill him without Jungjong's approval. But when he learned that Nam Gon and Shim Jung became Vice State Councillor and Minister of Personnel, he finally realized that Jungjong's change of heart was final.\n\nBefore drinking the poison, Jo wrote a poem declaring his loyalty, asked his people not to make coffin too heavy, and apologized to the owner and servant of the house for not paying his debt and instead showing them terrible sight and desecrating their house. He then bowed four times toward the north in the direction of palace. (It was customary to pay respect to the king in gratitude for granting poison, which was not an official method of execution and was considered more honorable form of death, instead of beheading or hanging.) When he drank poison, he did not die immediately and soldiers tried to strangle him. Jo rebuked them saying that the king intended to spare his neck by sending the poison and requested for another bowl of poison. He died at the age of 37. Later when there was a severe drought in the country, the populace blamed that it was heaven's punishment for killing an innocent seonbi. Many of remaining Sarim scholars left the central government in protest and retreated to rural provinces. Most of Jo's reforms were revoked with his fall.\n\nThe Third Literati Purge of 1519 (기묘사화 己卯士禍) was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to reform Joseon Dynasty by later generations because Joseon politics soon degenerated into power struggle among in-laws and relatives of the royal family. A year after the purge, a histographer wrote that bribery and corruption became widespread in the court and local administrations. Later, purge victims were venerated as \"Wise Men of Gimyo\" (Gimyo is the Korean calendar name for year 1519) while three main instigators (Hong Kyung-ju, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung) were collectively called \"Evil Three of Gimyo\".\n\nHong Kyung-ju died two years later of natural causes, but Shim Jung and Consort Kyung of Park clan were later executed on a framed charge of cursing the crown prince in a plot concocted by their rival Kim Anro (Kim Anro was killed by rival Yoon Won-hyung, who in turn was purged by King Myeongjong - Shim, Kim, and Yoon are all considered some of the most corrupt officials in Joseon dynasty). Nam Gon, who was reportedly deeply saddened at Jo's death, regretted his role in the purge and willed that all his writings be burnt, saying that he \"deceived the world with vain name,\" so no writing of his remains except for one short poem although he was one of the most famous writers of his time. Nam Gon, initially of Sarim faction as a disciple of Kim Jong-jik, was a moderate supporter of reforms and supposedly sought Jo Gwangjo's friendship but was rebuffed by Jo and his supporters as a petty Hungu official. \nTen years after the purge, King Jungjong again began to advance Sarim scholars by recalling them from exile and reappointing them to the royal court. Nevertheless, Jungjong did not rehabilitate Jo Gwangjo's name to the end despite endless petitions, saying at one time that what happened in 1519 was \"neither right nor wrong.\" \n(There is speculation as to what Jungjong really believed about the leaf incident since Jungjong never accused Jo of disloyalty or anything but pure intentions after first few days of Jo's arrest. From very early on, Jungjong's official position has been that Jo intended well but caused a situation that could only be rectified with a purge.) Jo Gwangjo was finally rehabilitated by his son Injong of Joseon, and was posthumously honored as a chief state councillor by Seonjo of Joseon in 1568.\n\nJo Gwangjo was greatly venerated by later generations of Korean neo-Confucianists as their spiritual head, but was also criticized for mistakes that led to the failure of his reforms. Yi Hwang and Yi I, often considered Joseon's two greatest Confucian philosophers, lamented that he entered politics too early before his scholarship was completed and pursued his reforms too rapidly. Nevertheless, Yi Hwang praised him as one of \"Four Wise of the East\" along with Kim Gwoeng-pil, Jeong Yeo-chang, and Yi Eonjeok and said that Jo showed the direction for all seonbis to aim and follow and unveiled the foundation of governing a country. Jo Gwangjo's emphasis on neo-Confucian ethics as practical philosophy has been very influential as the previous focus has been on more literary aspects of Confucianism. It was also during his time that Confucianism finally took roots deeply among the common populace. Even though Confucianism was the official state religion since the founding of Joseon Dynasty, Confucian practices were largely limited to aristocratic class. His dream of making neo-Confucianism the predominant philosophy of Joseon was soon accomplished by the reign of Seonjo, fifty years after his death. He was canonized and enshrined in the Seonggyungwan in 1610, one of only eighteen Korean Confucian scholars so honored by the Joseon Dynasty. However, Sarim faction that venerated Jo Gwangjo's name did not attempt to carry out his reforms when they seized political power during Seonjo's reign and all the while they maintained power until the end of Joseon dynasty. Some people blame Jo Gwangjo for dogmatism of Korean Neo-Confucianism, which became very conservative and caused Korea to resist changes and new learnings from abroad.\n\nToday his name remains a byword for reform in Korea, and his example is often raised when there is a controversy about a reform.\n\nJo Gwangjo was the protagonist of 1996 KBS TV series \"Jo Gwangjo\" and was a prominent character in 2001 SBS TV series \"Ladies of the Palace\". In MBC TV series \"Dae Jang Geum\" (2003-4), he does not appear as a character, but his name is mentioned frequently as the political foe of fictitious villain Right Minister Oh. Main protagonist Jang Geum and Lady Han are falsely accused of being in conspiracy with Jo Gwangjo while male protagonist Min Jung-ho is portrayed as his supporter (Min Jung-ho found a doctor for him and is shown recruiting his followers to return to politics). In the musical version of \"Dae Jang Geum\", Jo Gwangjo is a prominent character as a friend of Min Jung-ho. In KBS TV series \"Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin\" (2004-5), Yi Sun-shin's grandfather is described to have been executed for supporting Jo Gwangjo and Yi's father is arrested while holding a memorial rite at Jo's abandoned house. In 2006 KBS series \"Hwang Jini\", the male protagonist Kim Jeong-han is portrayed as Jo Gwangjo's disciple while another character Lee Saeng become Hwang Jini's bodyguard after he leaves his father's home in disgust because his father is Jo Gwango-jo's friend but betrays him to become prime minister. In these dramas (Dae Jang Geum, Yi Sun-shin, and Hwang Jini), Jo Gwangjo does not appear as a character but serves as a plot device to set the main characters as righteous people by association.\n\n"}

Because of openness to teaching Western students, he had considerable influence on the development of Rinzai Zen practice in the West.\n\nFukushima became an acolyte monk at the age of thirteen under his original teacher Kidō Okada, abbot of Hōfuku-ji monastery in Okayama, Japan. Fukushima graduated from Otani University’s Department of Buddhist Studies in 1956, following completion of Otani’s doctoral course. In 1961 he began monastic training with Zenkei Shibayama at Nanzen-ji Monastery in Kyoto. Fukushima’s main teacher, Zenkei Shibayama, was instrumental in helping to transplant Rinzai Zen to the West. He was one of the first Rinzai Zen masters to hold retreats in the United States, and to publish books in English: \"A Flower Does Not Talk\", \"Ox-herding Pictures\", and \"Zen Comments on the Mumonkan / Gateless Barrier\". Shibayama made annual visits to the United States in the late 1960s. In 1969 he was accompanied by Fukushima (at that time senior monk at Nanzen-ji and known as Genshō). In 1973 Fukushima received a fellowship to study English at the Claremont Colleges where he conducted seminars on Zen and led \"zazen\" practice.\n\nAcknowledged as a Zen master in 1974, Fukushima was appointed vice-resident abbot of Hōfuku-ji where he began to train his own disciples. In 1980, he was appointed master of the Tōfuku-ji training monastery (\"senmon dōjō\" 専門道場) in Kyoto. He was elected head abbot (\"kanchō\" 管長) of Tōfuku-ji in 1991, supervising 363 affiliated temples.\n\nAfter being named Zen master and given the name Keidō, Fukushima strove to carry out his teacher Shibayama’s intention to introduce Rinzai Zen to the West. He accepted Western students as monks, both at Hōfuku-ji and Tōfuku-ji. Counter to tradition, he let women participate in monastic \"sesshin\"-retreats. He conducted annual speaking tours at American universities including Pomona College, Millsaps College, Hendrix College, Bard College, Columbia University, Xavier University in Cincinnati, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Kansas, the University of Richmond, Middlebury College and the University of Vermont. From 1991 onwards, these tours included some \"sesshin\"-retreats. After decades of contact with American Zen, Fukushima gradually revised his views on it. In October 2007 he wrote: \nFukushima also worked to raise awareness and funds to revive and reconstruct several of China's important historical monasteries, thereby aiding Chán's emergence from the Cultural Revolution's devastating effects. Jōshū's monastery at Zhao Zhou, now known as Bailin, was the first of these efforts to achieve official government support. On later trips, Fukushima and other priests provided assistance for the rebuilding of Manjuji (萬寿寺) on Mt. Kinzan (径山), of particular importance to the Tōfuku-ji tradition since the founder Enni Ben’en (also known as Shōichi Kokushi) trained there between 1235 and 1241.\n\nWell known for his calligraphy, Fukushima was an authority on reading classical Chinese and Kanbun (a hybrid Chinese/Japanese script). Although many Buddhist priests produce religiously inspired art, they rarely create their works in front of an audience. Fukushima realized the very act of doing calligraphy could exert educational and inspirational influence upon those who witnessed it. In keeping with Japanese conventions, he did not give calligraphy demonstrations for Japanese audiences, but he did incorporate such events among his overseas teaching activities.\n\nAround 2000, Fukushima began showing symptoms of the onset of Parkinson’s disease, and his health steadily declined. He died on his seventy-eighth birthday (March 1) in 2011.\n\nThroughout his teaching career, Fukushima was clear about what is required to train others using \"kōan\". Guiding others in this training can be done by those who have finished the entire \"kōan\" curriculum through rigorous training over many years, then matured further on their own.

In 1757, Ekhof left Schönemann to join Franz Schuch's company in Danzig, but he soon returned to Hamburg, where, in conjunction with two other actors, he succeeded Schönemann in the direction of the company. \nHe resigned this position, however, in favor of H. G. Koch, with whom he acted until 1764, when he joined K. E. Ackermann's company. In 1767, the Hamburg National Theatre or the Hamburgische Entreprise was founded, backed by Abel Seyler and a group of merchants, and was made famous by Lessing's \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\". Ekhof was the leading member of the company. After the failure of the enterprise Ekhof was persuaded to join its successor, the travelling Seyler Theatre Company, and performed at the court in Weimar with the Seyler company for some time. He ultimately became co-director of the new court theatre at Gotha. This, the first permanently established theatre in Germany, was opened on 2 October 1775. Ekhof's reputation was now at its height; Goethe called him the only German tragic actor; and in 1777 he acted with Goethe and Duke Charles Augustus at a private performance at Weimar, dining afterward with the poet at the ducal table.\n\nHis versatility may be judged from the fact that in the comedies of Goldoni and Molière he was no less successful than in the tragedies of Lessing and Shakespeare. He was regarded by his contemporaries as an unsurpassed exponent of naturalness on the stage; and in this respect he has been not unfairly compared with Garrick. His fame, however, was rapidly eclipsed by that of Friedrich U. Schröder. His literary efforts were chiefly confined to translations from French authors.\n\n"}

He also advocated Russia's cultural and territorial expansion eastward to India, Tibet and China.\n\nLeontiev was born and grew up on his father's estate. His father, a nobleman, was a military officer but was discharged for \"riotous behaviour\". Still, the intervention of the Russian empress in behalf of the Leontiev brothers made him able to enter the Imperial Corps of Pages. He was engaged at 23 but broke off the relationship for the sake of \"freedom and art\"\" a decision that made things difficult for him. After completing medical school in Moscow, Leontiev saw service as a doctor during the Crimean War.\n\nIn 1861, he carried off a local Crimean girl, the daughter of a Greek merchant, from Feodosiya, eventually marrying her.\n\nHe later lived in various Ottoman towns as a Russian consular agent, devoting his leisure time to writing oriental fiction on many themes, some of which included a condemnation of homophobia and implied that he may have been bisexual. In the summer of 1871, after praying to the Virgin Mary, he was cured of cholera and dysentery and promised Her to take monastic vows. Later that fall, he moved to the Russian monastery on Mount Athos. In 1880, he moved to the censorship department in Moscow, where he published several acclaimed analyses of Leo Tolstoy's novels.\n\nSeven years later, he secretly took the tonsure at the Optina monastery, famous for its startsy. He died as a monk in the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra.\n\nLeontiev's most remarkable book is a volume of essays, \"The East, Russia, and Slavdom\" (1885–1886). Like Nikolay Danilevsky and Fyodor Dostoyevsky before him, he was ill at ease with the Western consumer society and the cult of material prosperity. Leontiev regarded traditional Russian Byzantinism as a blessing and a strong antidote against further liberalisation of the country's society. His aesthetic and political theories had some similarities to those of Friedrich Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler. Preceding the latter's theory of the cyclical nature of civilizations and \"The Decline of the West\" by several decades, Leontiev proposed that all societies undergo a state of flowering and increasing complexity followed by one of \"secondary simplification\", decay and, ultimately, death. Leontiev felt that the West had reached the beginning of secondary simplification.\n\nA pessimist, Leontiev made several predictions that turned out to come true. He prophesied that in the 20th century, there would be a bloody revolution in Russia led by an \"anti-Christ\" that would be socialist and tyrannical in nature and whose rulers would wield even more power than their tsarist predecessors. He said, \"Socialism is the feudalism of the future\". He felt that only the harshest reaction could prevent that scenario.\n\nHe also predicted that Germany would grow strong enough to make up to two wars against Russia and that China also would eventually threaten Russia's power. He also claimed that technology would one day lead to universal destruction.\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote over forty books on spiritual practice and parenting, many of which have been translated into French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and other languages. Some of the titles include: \"In the Fire\", \"Conscious Parenting\", \"The Alchemy of Transformation\", \"The Alchemy of Love and Sex\", \"The Only Grace is Loving God\", and \"Enlightened Duality\" (with M Young). He presented himself as a representative of the \"Western Baul\" tradition.\n\nLee Lozowick was born on November 18, 1943, to Ukrainian-American artist Louis Lozowick and Adele Turner, who had married in 1933 and lived in South Orange, New Jersey.\n\nLozowick became a student of Silva Mind Control in 1970 and became interested in the human potential movement around the same time. He had an awakening experience in 1975. During this period he operated a small center in Mount Tabor, New Jersey where Silva Mind Control was taught, along with occasional guest lectures and acoustic guitar lessons for younger attendees. In his early phase \"some people accused Lee of plagiarizing the work of Da Free John. Lee reports that his speaking style and writing were the articulation of his own experience and denies the charge.\" With several of his students, he made a pilgrimage to India in 1977, where he met Yogi Ramsuratkumar. Lozowick became a disciple of Yogi Ramsuratkumar, and attributed his earlier awakening, or what he refers to as a \"shift in context,\" retroactively to Yogi Ramsuratkumar, although he did not feel much connection to Yogi Ramsuratkumar until the 1980s. Lee subsequently became known to many people the world over as the \"Heart-Son\" of Yogi Ramsuratkumar after he wrote several volumes of devotional poetry containing over a thousand poems dedicated to his spiritual master.\n\nLozowick then formed a spiritual community called Hohm in New Jersey and began to gather disciples. In 1980, he moved the community to Arizona, where it comprised a \"Hohm Sahaj Mandir\" (Hohm Innate Divinity Temple) and the \"Hohm Community.\" Lozowick founded three ashrams: Triveni Ashram in Arizona, USA; the Ramji Association's Ashram at Ferme de Jutreau in France, and the Triveni II Ashram in Tiruvannamalai, India. The Community also established Hohm Press, which has published a number of books on topics such as natural health, Eastern religion, poetry, and parenting, including those written by Lozowick. According to scholar Helen Crovetto, who has studied the community, \"Lee said the word 'Hohm' has no translation and chose not to elaborate on its significance.\"\n\nLozowick came to identify with the Baul tradition of Bengal, speculating that Yogi Ramsuratkumar may have had some connection to that community as well during years of his early life that he no longer remembered or refused to disclose, although Ramsuratkumar was not a Baul by lineage. Subsequently, however, the Hohm community did establish relationships with a number of Bengali Bauls, such as Sanatan Das and Purna Das. The focus of spiritual practice in Lozowick's teaching is guru yoga, and some have considered him a proponent of \"crazy wisdom.\" (See George Feuerstein, Divine Madness). He was an ardent admirer of Chogyam Trungpa. Lozowick was known to discourage potential students in his public lectures with the \"sexual content of much of\" his talk, or by \"loud obnoxiousness.\" \"His public demeanor seems to be a technique for scaring away those who are only superficially interested in the spiritual path.\"\n\nThe Hohm community also incorporates elements of the work of George I. Gurdjieff into their philosophy, particularly \"in the Western Bauls' speculations about the existence of soul and especially in their adoption of his chakra (energy center) system.\"\n\nAs of 2006, total membership in the Hohm community was \"not much more than a hundred,\" in part due to the desire of Lozowick to keep the number of disciples down to a number where he could remain on a first name basis with all of them. Hohm community members incorporate music into their spiritual practice, and a few are in blues and rock bands, first started by Lozowick, principally (at present) Shri, and The Denise Allen Band.\n\nDuring the last twenty years of his life, Lozowick had an enduring friendship and collaboration with the late spiritual teacher, Arnaud Desjardins, as well as with Robert Svoboda, and Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee.\n\nLee Lozowick died of cancer on November 16, 2010, in Prescott, Arizona, after a long illness. His work is carried on by his disciples, including Purna Steinitz, who has his own \"Trimurti Community\" begun in 1998 in Bozeman, Montana, and Lalitha, in British Columbia. They are the only two who have \"received permission to teach in his lineage.\"\n"}
{"id": "397689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397689", "title": "Moral reasoning", "text": "Moral reasoning\n\nMoral reasoning, also known as moral development, is a study in psychology that overlaps with moral philosophy. Children can make moral decisions about what is right and wrong from a young age; this makes morality fundamental to the human condition. Moral reasoning, however, is a part of morality that occurs both within and between individuals. Prominent contributors to this theory include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel. The term is sometimes used in a different sense: reasoning under conditions of uncertainty, such as those commonly obtained in a court of law. It is this sense that gave rise to the phrase, \"To a moral certainty;\" however, this idea is now seldom used outside of charges to juries.\n\nMoral reasoning can be defined as being the process in which individuals try to determine the difference between what is right and what is wrong by using logic. This is an important and often daily process that people use when trying to do the right thing. For instance, every day people are faced with the dilemma of whether to lie in a given situation or not. People make this decision by reasoning the morality of their potential actions, and through weighing their actions against potential consequences.\n\nA moral choice can be a personal, economic, or ethical one; as described by some ethical code, or regulated by ethical relationships with others. This branch of psychology is concerned with how these issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the foundation of descriptive ethics. There are many different forms of moral reasoning which often are dictated by culture. Cultural differences in the high-levels of cognitive function associated with moral reasoning can be observed through the association of brain networks from various cultures and their moral decision making. These cultural differences demonstrate the neural basis that cultural influences can have on an individual’s moral reasoning and decision making . \n\nIn 1983, James Rest developed the four component Model of Morality, which addresses the ways that moral motivation and behavior occurs . The first of these is moral sensitivity, which is \"the ability to see an ethical dilemma, including how our actions will affect others\". The second is moral judgment, which is \"the ability to reason correctly about what 'ought' to be done in a specific situation\". The third is moral motivation, which is \"a personal commitment to moral action, accepting responsibility for the outcome\". The fourth and final component of moral behavior is moral character, which is a \"courageous persistence in spite of fatigue or temptations to take the easy way out\".\n\nDistinctions between theories of moral reasoning can be accounted for by evaluating inferences (which tend to be either deductive or inductive)based on a given set of premises. Deductive inference reaches a conclusion that is true based on whether a given set of premises preceding the conclusion are also true, whereas, inductive inference goes beyond information given in a set of premises to base the conclusion on provoked reflection.\n\nThis branch of psychology is concerned with how these issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the foundation of descriptive ethics. There are many different moral reasonings. Moral reasoning is culturally defined, and thus is difficult to apply; yet human relationships define our existence and thus defy cultural boundaries.\n\nLawrence Kohlberg is a psychologist who has made significant contributions to the field of moral reasoning by creating a theory of moral development. His theory is a \"widely accepted theory that provides the basis for empirical evidence on the influence of human decision making on ethical behavior.\"\nIn Lawrence Kohlberg's view, moral development consists of the growth of less egocentric and more impartial modes of reasoning on more complicated matters. He believed that the objective of moral education is the reinforcement of children to grow from one stage to an upper stage. Dilemma was a critical tool that he emphasized that children should be presented with; yet also, the knowledge for children to cooperate.\nAccording to his theory, people pass through three main stages of moral development as they grow from early childhood to adulthood. These are preconventional morality, conventional morality, and postconventional morality. Each of these is subdivided into two levels.\n\nThe first stage in the preconventional level is obedience and punishment. In this stage people, usually young children, avoid certain behaviors only because of the fear of punishment, not because they see them as wrong. The second stage in the preconventional level is called individualism and exchange: in this stage people make moral decisions based on what best serves their needs.\n\nThe third stage is part of the conventional morality level and is called interpersonal relationships. In this stage one tries to conform to what is considered moral by the society that they live in, attempting to be seen by peers as a good person. The fourth stage is also in the conventional morality level and is called maintaining social order. This stage focuses on a view of society as a whole and following the laws and rules of that society. \n\nThe fifth stage is a part of the postconventional level and is called social contract and individual rights. In this stage people begin to consider differing ideas about morality in other people and feel that rules and laws should be agreed on by the members of a society. The sixth and final stage of moral development, the second in the postconventional level, is called universal principles. At this stage people begin to develop their ideas of universal moral principles and will consider them the right thing to do regardless of what the laws of a society are.\n\nAnother psychologist who contributed to the field of moral reasoning was Jean Piaget. He developed two phases of moral development, one common among children and the other common among adults. The first is known as the Heteronomous Phase. This phase, more common among children, is characterized by the idea that rules come from authority figures in one's life such as parents, teachers, and God. It also involves the idea that rules are permanent no matter what. Thirdly, this phase of moral development includes the belief that \"naughty\" behavior must always be punished and that the punishment will be proportional.\n\nThe second phase in Piaget's theory of moral development is referred to as the Autonomous Phase. This phase is more common after one has matured and is no longer a child. In this phase people begin to view the intentions behind actions as more important than their consequences. For instance, if a person who is driving swerves in order to not hit a dog and then knocks over a road sign, adults are likely to be less angry at the person than if he or she had done it on purpose just for fun. Even though the outcome is the same, people are more forgiving because of the good intention of saving the dog. This phase also includes the idea that people have different morals and that morality is not necessarily universal. People in the Autonomous Phase also believe rules may be broken under certain circumstances. For instance, Rosa Parks broke the law by refusing to give up her seat on a bus, which was against the law but something many people consider moral nonetheless. In this phase people also stop believing in the idea of immanent justice.\n\nJonathan Haidt is a social psychologist who defines moral as: the sudden appearance in consciousness of a moral judgment, including an affective valence (good–bad, like–dislike), without any awareness of having gone through steps of searching, weighing evidence, or inferring a moral conclusion. Moral intuition is therefore the psychological process that the Scottish philosophers talked about, aprocess akin to aesthetic judgment. One sees or hears about an event and one instantly feels approval or disapproval. Haidt argues that many people do not utilize conscious reasoning to make our judgments.\n\nGusto Blasi is a moral psychologist who rebuts the theories of Jonathan Haidt on moral intuition and reasoning. He agrees with Haidt that moral intuition plays a significant role in the way humans operate. However, Blasi suggests that people use moral reasoning more than Haidt and other cognitive scientists claim. Blasi advocates moral reasoning and reflection as the foundation of moral functioning. Reasoning and reflection play a key role in the growth of an individual and the progress of societies. Blasi, A. (2009). \n\nPhilosopher David Hume and psychologist Jonathan Haidt both claim that morality is based more on perceptions than on logical reasoning. This means that people's morality is based more on their emotions and feelings than on a logical analysis of any given situation. Hume regards morals as linked to passion, love, happiness, and other emotions and therefore not based on reason. Haidt agrees, arguing that reasoning concerning a moral situation or idea follows an initial intuition. Haidt's fundamental stance on moral reasoning is that \"moral intuitions (including moral emotions) come first and directly cause moral judgments\"; he characterizes a moral intuition as \"the sudden appearance in consciousness of a moral judgment, including an affective valence (good-bad, like-dislike), without any conscious awareness of having gone through steps of searching, weighing evidence, or inferring a conclusion\".\n\nImmanuel Kant had a radically different view of morality. In his view, there are universal laws of morality that no one should never break regardless of emotions. He proposes a four-step system to determine whether or not a given action was moral based on logic and reason. The first step of this method involves formulating \"a maxim capturing your reason for an action\". In the second step, one \"frame[s] it as a universal principle for all rational agents\". The third step is assessing \"whether a world based on this universal principle is conceivable\". If it is, then the fourth step is asking oneself \"whether [one] would will the maxim to be a principle in this world\". In essence, an action is moral if the maxim by which it is justified is one which could be universalized. For instance, when deciding whether or not to lie to someone for one's own advantage, one is meant to imagine what the world would be like if everyone always lied, and successfully so. In such a world, there would be no purpose in lying, for everybody would expect deceit, rendering the universal maxim of lying whenever it is to your advantage absurd. Thus, Kant argues that one should not lie under any circumstance. Another example would be if trying to decide whether suicide is moral or immoral; imagine if everyone committed suicide. Since mass international suicide would not be a good thing, the act of suicide is immoral. Kant's moral framework, however, operates under the overarching maxim that you should treat each person as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end. This overarching maxim must be considered when applying the four aforementioned steps. \n\nAt one time psychologists believed that men and women have different moral values and reasoning. This was based on the idea that men and women often think differently and would react to moral dilemmas in different ways. Some researchers hypothesized that women would favor care reasoning, meaning that they would consider issues of need and sacrifice, while men would be more inclined to favor fairness and rights, which is known as justice reasoning. However, some also knew that men and women simply face different moral dilemmas on a day-to-day basis and that might be the reason for the perceived difference in their moral reasoning. With these two ideas in mind, researchers decided to do their experiments based on moral dilemmas that both men and women face regularly. To reduce situational differences and discern how both genders use reason in their moral judgments, they therefore ran the tests on parenting situations, since both genders can be involved in child rearing. The research showed that women and men use the same form of moral reasoning as one another and the only difference is the moral dilemmas they find themselves in on a day-to-day basis. When it came to moral decisions both men and women would be faced with, they often chose the same solution as being the moral choice. At least this research shows that a division in terms of morality does not actually exist, and that reasoning between genders is the same in moral decisions.\n\n\n"}

The term is taken from the Latin adjective form for \"birth\", \"natalis\". Natalism promotes child-bearing and parenthood as desirable for social reasons and to ensure the continuance of humanity. Natalism in public policy typically seeks to create financial and social incentives for populations to reproduce, such as providing tax incentives that reward having and supporting children. Adherents of more stringent takes on natalism may seek to limit access to abortion and contraception, as well. The opposite of natalism is antinatalism.\n\nMany religions (including some parts of Judaism and some branches of Christianity, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Catholic Church) encourage procreation.\n\nThe Amish are among the fastest-growing populations in the world, with an average of 6.8 children per family.\n\nA recent movement among conservative Protestants, known as the Quiverfull movement, advocates for large families. Some scholars note that Quiverfull resembles other world-denying fundamentalist movements which grow through internal reproduction and membership retention, such as Haredi Judaism, the Amish, Laestadianism in Finland and Sweden and the Salafi movement in the Muslim world. Many such groups grow relative to other categories, as seculars and moderates may have by contrast transitioned as far as below-replacement fertility, in certain groups.\n\nAn intention to have children is a substantial fertility factor in actually ending up doing so, but childless individuals who intend to have children immediately or within 2 or 3 years are generally more likely to succeed than those who intend to have children in the long-term.\nThere are many determinants of the intention to have children, including:\n\nSome countries with population decline offer incentives to the people to have large families as a means of national efforts to reverse declining populations. Incentives may include a one time baby bonus, or ongoing child benefit payments or tax reductions. Some impose penalties or taxes on those with fewer children. Some nations, such as Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, have implemented, or tried to implement, interventionist natalist policies, creating incentives for larger families among native stock. Immigrants are generally not part of natalist policies.\n\nPaid maternity and paternity leave policies can also be used as an incentive. For example, Sweden has generous parental leave wherein parents are entitled to share 16 months paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and State.\n\nBooks advocating natalist policies include \"What to Expect When No One's Expecting\" by Jonathan V. Last.\n\nAntinatalism, or anti-natalism, is a philosophical position that assigns a negative value to birth. Antinatalists argue that people should refrain from procreation because it is ethically bad (some also recognize procreation of other sentient beings as ethically bad). In scholarly and in literary writings, various ethical foundations have been adduced for antinatalism. Some of the earliest surviving formulations of the idea that it would be better not to have been born come from ancient Greece. The term \"antinatalism\" was used probably for the first time as the name of the position by Théophile de Giraud (born 1968) in his book \"L'art de guillotiner les procréateurs: Manifeste anti-nataliste\".\n\n"}

He also draws heavily on the works of Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Gottlob Frege, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nHe is best known for his investigations of linguistic meanings, or semantics. He advocates the view that the meaning of an expression is fixed by how it is used in inferences (see inferential role semantics). This project is developed at length in his influential 1994 book, \"Making It Explicit\", and more briefly in \"Articulating Reasons: An Introduction to Inferentialism\" (2000); a chapter of that latter work, \"Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism\", outlines the main themes of representationalism (the tradition of basing semantics on the concept of representation) vs. inferentialism (the conviction for an expression to be meaningful is has to be governed by a certain kind of inferential rules) and inferentialism's relationship to logical expressivism (the conviction that \"logic is expressive in the sense that it makes explicit or codifies certain aspects of the inferential structure of our discursive practice\").\n\nBrandom has also published a collection of essays on the history of philosophy, \"Tales of the Mighty Dead\" (2002), a critical and historical sketch of what he calls the \"philosophy of intentionality\". He is the editor of a collection of papers about Richard Rorty's philosophy, \"Rorty and His Critics\" (2000). He delivered the 2006 John Locke lectures at Oxford University, and they have been published by Oxford University Press under the title \"Between Saying and Doing: Towards an Analytic Pragmatism\" (2008). Brandom is currently working on a book dealing with Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24444669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24444669", "title": "Sa Aking Mga Kabata", "text": "Sa Aking Mga Kabata\n\n\"Sa Aking mga Kabata\" () is a poem about the love of one's native language written in Tagalog. It is widely attributed to the Filipino national hero José Rizal, who supposedly wrote it in 1869 at the age of eight. There is no evidence, however, to support authorship by Rizal and several historians now believe it to be a hoax. The actual author of the poem is suspected to have been the poets Gabriel Beato Francisco or Herminigildo Cruz.\n\nThe poem was widely taught in Philippine schools to point out Rizal's precociousness and early development of his nationalistic ideals.\n\nA passage of the poem often paraphrased as \"Ang hindì marunong magmahal sa sariling wikà, masahol pa sa hayop at malansang isdâ\" (English: 'He that knows not to love his own language, is worse than beasts and putrid fish') is widely quoted to promote the use of Tagalog among Filipinos. It is encountered most frequently during the \"Buwan ng Wika\" ('Language Month'), a commemoration of the establishment of the Filipino language as the national language of the Philippines.\n\nNo manuscript for \"Sa Aking Mga Kabatà\" written in Rizal's handwriting exists. The poem was first published in 1906, a decade after his death, in a book authored by the poet Hermenigildo Cruz. Cruz claimed that he received the poem from another poet, Gabriel Beato Francisco, who in turn received it in 1884 from an alleged close friend of Rizal, Saturnino Raselis. José Rizal, however, has never mentioned anyone by the name of Saturnino Raselis. The poem may have actually been written by Cruz or Francisco.\n\nPascual H. Poblete published a different account in his introduction to the 1909 translation \"Noli Me Tangere; Novelang Wicang Castila Na Tinagalog Ni Pascual H. Poblete\" (note old Tagalog spelling), he claims that the poem was well-known to Filipino poets during Rizal's childhood. This account was later repeated in Austin Coates' 1968 biography of Rizal, \"\", who further added that Juan Luna had a role in preserving the poem. This is not substantiated by any known evidence.\n\nThe earliest known poems of Rizal in the National Historical Institute’s collection, \"Poesías Por José Rizal\", also date six years after the alleged writing date of \"Sa Aking Mga Kabatà\". His own account of the earliest awakening of his nationalistic views, identifies it as the year 1872 – the year of the executions of the priests Mariano Gómez, José Apolonio Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora. The poem is never mentioned by Rizal himself in all his voluminous writings, despite its apparent significance in terms of his future ideals.\n\nHistorian Ambeth Ocampo, National Artist of the Philippines and writer Virgilio S. Almario and others have debunked Rizal's traditional authorship of the poem based on the following:\n\nThe poem uses the Tagalog word \"kalayaan\" (liberty/freedom). However, Rizal first encountered the word at least by 1882, when he was 25 years old – 17 years after he supposedly wrote the poem. Rizal first came across \"kalayaan\", or as it was spelled, \"kalayahan\", through a Tagalog translation by Marcelo H. del Pilar of Rizal's own essay \"El Amor Patrio\".\n\nThe fluency and sophistication of the Tagalog used in the poem also do not match Rizal's grasp of the language. Although Rizal's native tongue was Tagalog, his early education was all in Spanish. In the oft-quoted anecdote of the moth and the flame from Rizal's memoir, the children's book he and his mother were reading was entitled \"El Amigo de los Niños\", and it was in Spanish. He would later lament his difficulties in expressing himself in Tagalog. In 1886, Rizal was in Leipzig working on a Tagalog translation of Friedrich Schiller's \"William Tell\", which he sent home to his brother Paciano. In the accompanying letter, Rizal speaks of his difficulty finding an appropriate Tagalog equivalent of \"Freiheit\" (freedom), settling on \"kalayahan\". Rizal cited Del Pilar's translation of his own essay as his source for \"kalayahan\". Rizal also attempted to write \"Makamisa\" (the intended sequel to \"El filibusterismo\") in Tagalog, only to give up after only ten pages and start again in Spanish.\n\nThe 8-year old Rizal's apparent familiarity with Latin and English is also questionable. In his memoir as a student in Manila, a year after the poem's supposed writing date, he admitted only having 'a little' knowledge of Latin from lessons by a friend of his father. Rizal also did not study English until 1880, more than ten years after the poem was allegedly written. English was not a prominent language in the Philippines in 1869 and its presence in the poem is believed to betray later authorship during the American Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\nThe poem also makes use of the letters 'K' and 'W', whereas during Rizal's childhood, Tagalog spelling was based on Spanish orthography where neither letters were used. The letters 'C' and 'U' were used instead. (i.e., the poem would have been spelled \"Sa Aquing Mañga Cabata\") The shift in Tagalog and later Filipino orthography from 'C' to 'K' and 'U' to 'W' were proposed by Rizal himself as an adult, and was later made official in the early 20th century by the Philippine government as per grammarian Lope K. Santos's proposal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "177582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177582", "title": "Sextus Empiricus", "text": "Sextus Empiricus\n\nSextus Empiricus (; c. 160 – c. 210 CE, dates uncertain), was a physician and philosopher, who likely lived in Alexandria, Rome, or Athens. His philosophical work is the most complete surviving account of ancient Greek and Roman Pyrrhonism.\n\nIn his medical work, as reflected by his name, tradition maintains that he belonged to the empiric school in which Pyrrhonism was popular. However, at least twice in his writings, Sextus seems to place himself closer to the methodic school. He may have been the same person as Sextus of Chaeronea.\n\nSextus Empiricus's three surviving works are the \"Outlines of Pyrrhonism\" (Πυῤῥώνειοι ὑποτυπώσεις, \"Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis\", thus commonly abbreviated \"PH\"), and two distinct works preserved under the same title, \"Against the Mathematicians\" (\"Adversus Mathematicos\"), one of which is probably incomplete as there are references in the text to parts that are not in the surviving text.\n\nThe first six books of \"Against the Mathematicians\" (Πρὸς μαθηματικούς, \"Pros mathematikous\") are commonly known as \"Against the Professors\", and each book also has a traditional title:\n\"Against the Mathematicians I–VI is sometimes distinguished from \"Against the Mathematicians VII–XI by using an other title, \"Against the Dogmatists\" ( \"Πρὸς δογματικούς, Pros dogmatikous\") and then the remaining books are numbered as I–II, III–IV, and V, despite the fact that it is also commonly inferred that the beginning of such a separate work is missing and it is not known how many books might have preceded the extant books. The supposed general title of this work is \"Skeptical Treatises\"' (\"Σκεπτικὰ Ὑπομνήματα /Skeptika Hypomnēmata\").\n\nNote that none of these titles except \"Against the Mathematicians\" and \"Outlines of Pyrrhonism\", are found in the manuscripts.\n\nSextus Empiricus raised concerns which applied to all types of knowledge. He doubted the validity of induction long before its best known critic David Hume, and raised the regress argument against all forms of reasoning:\nBecause of these and other barriers to acquiring true beliefs, Sextus Empiricus advises that we should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs; that is to say, we should neither affirm any belief as true nor deny any belief as false. This view is known as Pyrrhonian skepticism, as distinguished from Academic skepticism, as practiced by Carneades, which, according to Sextus, denies knowledge altogether. Sextus did not deny the possibility of knowledge. He criticizes the Academic skeptic's claim that nothing is knowable as being an affirmative belief. Instead, Sextus advocates simply giving up belief; in other words, suspending judgment about whether or not anything is knowable. Only by suspending judgment can we attain a state of ataraxia (roughly, 'peace of mind'). Sextus did not think such a general suspension of judgment to be impractical, since we may live without any beliefs, acting by habit.\n\nSextus allowed that we might affirm claims about our experience (e.g., reports about our feelings or sensations). That is, for some claim X that I feel or perceive, it could be true to say \"it seems to me now that X.\" However, he pointed out that this does not imply any objective knowledge of external reality. Though I might know that the honey I eat at a certain moment tastes sweet to me, this is merely a subjective judgment, and as such may not tell me anything true about the honey itself.\n\nInterpretations of Sextus's philosophy along the above lines have been advocated by scholars such as Myles Burnyeat, Jonathan Barnes, and Benson Mates.\n\nMichael Frede, however, defends a different interpretation, according to which Sextus does allow beliefs, so long as they are not derived by reason, philosophy or speculation; a skeptic may, for example, accept common opinions in the skeptic's society. The important difference between the skeptic and the dogmatist is that the skeptic does not hold his beliefs \"as a result of rigorous philosophical investigation.\" In \"Against the Ethicists\", Sextus in fact directly says that \"the Skeptic does not conduct his life according to philosophical theory (so far as regards this he is inactive), but as regards the non-philosophical regulation of life he is capable of desiring some things and avoiding others.\" (XI, 165). Thus, on this interpretation (and as per Sextus' own words), the skeptic may well entertain the belief that God does or does not exist or that virtue is good. But he will not believe that such claims are true on the basis of \"reasons\" since, as far as the skeptic is aware, no reason for assenting to such claims has yet been shown to be \"any more\" credible than the reasons for their denial. (XIX)\n\nIt must also be remembered that by \"dogma\" Sextus means \"assent to something non-evident [ἄδηλος, adēlos]\" (PH I, 16). And by \"non-evident\" he means things which lie beyond appearances (and thus beyond proof or disproof), such as the existence and/or nature of causality, time, motion, or even proof itself. Thus, the skeptic will, for example, believe the proposition that \"Dion is in the room\" if sense-data and ordinary reasoning led to the emergence of such a belief. On the other hand, if he were to \"strongly\" assert that Dion was \"really\" in the room, then he may be met with opposing arguments of equal psychological force against the self-same proposition and experience mental disquietude as a result. Thus, the Pyrrhonian does not assent to the proposition \"Dion is in the room\" in a dogmatic way as that would purport to describe a non-evident reality which lies beyond the \"appearance\" [φαινόμενον, phainomenon] of Dion being in the room. The Skeptic simply goes along with the appearance just as \"a child is persuaded by...his teacher.\" (PH I, 229). It is for this reason then that Sextus says the Skeptic lives undogmatically in accordance with appearances and also according to a \"fourfold regimine of life\" which includes the guidance of nature, compulsion of \"pathe\" (feelings), laws and customs, and instruction in arts and crafts. The Skeptic follows this course of life while suspending judgment concerning the ultimate truth of the non-evident matters debated in philosophy and the sciences (PH I, 17). Thus, the Pyrrhonian Skeptic is one who believes possibly many things, but yet does not dogmatize about those beliefs since he finds no ultimate justification for them. Thus, the Pyrrhonian achieves \"ataraxia\" not by casting certain judgments about appearances but rather through his refined \"ability\" to \"oppose appearances to judgments\" such that he is \"brought firstly to a state of mental suspense and next to a state of 'unperturbedness' or 'quietude.'\" (IV, 8)\n\nBecause of the high degree of similarity between the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus and those of the Buddhist philosopher, Nagarjuna Thomas McEvilley suspects that Nagarjuna and Sextus Empiricus were referencing some of the same earlier Pyrrhonist texts in developing their works.\n\nPyrrhonism is more a mental attitude or therapy than a theory. It involves setting things in opposition and owing to the equipollence of the objects and reasons, one suspends judgement. \"We oppose either appearances to appearances or objects of thought to objects of thought or \"alternando.\"\" The ten modes induce suspension of judgement and in turn a state of mental suspense followed by \"ataraxia.\" If ever one is in a position in which they are unable to refute a theory, Pyrrhonists reply \"Just as, before the birth of the founder of the School to which you belong, the theory it holds was not as yet apparent as a sound theory, although it was really in existence, so likewise it is possible that the opposite theory to that which you now propound is already really existent, though not yet apparent to us, so that we ought not as yet to yield assent to this theory which at the moment seems to be valid.\" These ten \"modes\" or \"tropes\" were originally listed by Aenesidemus.\n\n\nSuperordinate to these ten modes stand three other modes:\n\nSuperordinate to these three modes is the mode of relation.\n\nAn influential Latin translation of Sextus's \"Outlines\" was published by Henricus Stephanus in Geneva in 1562, and this was followed by a complete Latin Sextus with Gentian Hervet as translator in 1569. Petrus and Jacobus Chouet published the Greek text for the first time in 1621. Stephanus did not publish it with his Latin translation either in 1562 or in 1569, nor was it published in the reprint of the latter in 1619.\n\nSextus's \"Outlines\" were widely read in Europe during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and had a profound effect on Michel de Montaigne, David Hume, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, among many others. Another source for the circulation of Sextus's ideas was Pierre Bayle's \"Dictionary\". The legacy of Pyrrhonism is described in Richard Popkin's \"The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes\" and \"High Road to Pyrrhonism\". The transmission of Sextus's manuscripts through antiquity and the Middle Ages is reconstructed by Luciano Floridi's \"Sextus Empiricus, The Recovery and Transmission of Pyrrhonism\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). Since the Renaissance French philosophy has been continuously influenced by Sextus: Montaigne in the 16th century, Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Pierre-Daniel Huet and François de La Mothe Le Vayer in the 17th century, many of the \"Philosophes,\" and in recent times controversial figures such as Michel Onfray, in a direct line of filiation between Sextus' radical skepticism and secular or even radical atheism.\n\nSextus is the earliest known source for the proverb \"Slowly grinds the mill of the gods, but it grinds fine\", alluded to in Longfellow's poem \"Retribution\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4426579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4426579", "title": "State responsibility", "text": "State responsibility\n\nThe laws of state responsibility are the principles governing when and how a state is held responsible for a breach of an international obligation. Rather than set forth any particular obligations, the rules of state responsibility determine, in general, when an obligation has been breached and the legal consequences of that violation. In this way they are \"secondary\" rules that address basic issues of responsibility and remedies available for breach of \"primary\" or substantive rules of international law, such as with respect to the use of armed force. Because of this generality, the rules can be studied independently of the primary rules of obligation. They establish (1) the conditions of actions to qualify as internationally wrongful, (2) the circumstances under which actions of officials, private individuals and other entities may be attributed to the state, (3) general defences to liability and (4) the consequences of liability.\n\nUntil recently, the theory of the law of state responsibility was not well developed. The position has now changed, with the adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"Draft Articles\") by the International Law Commission (ILC) in August 2001. The Draft Articles are a combination of codification and progressive development. They have already been cited by the International Court of Justice and have generally been well received.\n\nAlthough the articles are general in coverage, they do not necessarily apply in all cases. Particular treaty regimes, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European Convention on Human Rights, have established their own special rules of responsibility.\n\nTraditionally, the term \"state responsibility\" referred only to state responsibility for injuries to aliens. It included not only \"secondary\" issues such as attribution and remedies, but also the primary rights and duties of states, for example the asserted international standard of treatment and the right of diplomatic protection. Early efforts by the League of Nations and private bodies to codify the rules of \"state responsibility\" reflected the traditional focus on responsibility for injuries to aliens. The League's 1930 Codification Conference in The Hague was able to reach an agreement only on \"secondary\" issues such as imputation, not on substantive rules regarding the treatment of aliens and their property.\n\nAttempts to codify and develop the rules of state responsibility have continued throughout the life of the United Nations. It took nearly 45 years, more than thirty reports, and extensive work by five Special Rapporteurs in order for the International Law Commission to reach agreement on the final text of the Draft Articles as a whole, with commentaries. At the same time, the customary international law of state responsibility concerning matters such as detention and physical ill-treatment of aliens and their right to a fair trial has been rendered less important than formerly by the development of international human rights law, which applies to all individuals, whether aliens or nationals. The concept of a general regime of legal responsibility, which the rules of state responsibility have taken on, is an inception of the civil law system and is largely foreign to the common law tradition.\n\nThe topic of state responsibility was one of the first 14 areas provisionally selected for the ILC's attention in 1949. When the ILC listed the topic for codification in 1953, \"state responsibility\" was distinguished from a separate topic on the \"treatment of aliens\", reflecting the growing view that state responsibility encompasses the breach of an international obligation.\n\nThe ILC's first special rapporteur on state responsibility, F.V. García Amador of Cuba, appointed in 1955 noted, \"It would be difficult to find a topic beset with greater confusion and uncertainty.\" García Amador attempted to return to the traditional focus on responsibility for injury to aliens but his work was essentially abandoned by the ILC when his membership ended in 1961. His successor, Roberto Ago of Italy, reconceptualised the ILC's work in terms of the distinction between primary and secondary rules, and also established the basic organisational structure of what would become the \"Draft Articles\". By focusing on general rules, stated at a high level of abstraction, Ago created a politically safe space within which the ILC could work and largely avoid the contentious debates of the day. From 1969 until his election to the ICJ in 1980, Ago completed work on part 1 of the draft articles, addressing the origin of state responsibility. Most of the thirty-five articles adopted during his tenure are reflected in the final draft.\n\nWork on the remainder of the articles proceeded slowly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Willem Riphagen of the Netherlands, who served as special rapporteur to 1986, stressed that particular primary rules may specify the consequences of their breach - an idea conveyed by the articles through the recognition of \"lex specialis\". Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz, special rapporteur from 1988, helped clarify the consequences of breaches of international obligations. Over the next eight years, the ILC completed its first reading of parts 2 and 3.\n\nIn 1995, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in effect pressing the Commission to make progress on the state responsibility articles and other long-pending projects. James Crawford of Australia, appointed as special rapporteur in 1996, approached the task pragmatically. The ILC moved rapidly through a second reading of the draft articles, adopting what it could agree on and jettisoning the rest, most notable of which was Article 19 on state crimes and the section on dispute settlement.\n\nThe final text of the Draft Articles was adopted by the ILC in August 2001, bringing to completion one of the Commission's longest running and most controversial studies. On 12 December 2001, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 56/83, which \"commended [the articles] to the attention of Governments without prejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action.\"\n\nCrawford notes that the rules are \"rigorously general in character,\" encompassing all types of international obligations.\n\nAccording to the \"Draft Articles\", an internationally wrongful act must:\n\nEarlier drafts of the Articles on State Responsibility contained Article 19, which provided for \"state crimes\". Article 19 included the following provisions:\n\n\"2. An internationally wrongful act which results from the breach by a State of an international obligation so essential for the protection of fundamental interests of the international community that its breach is recognized as a crime by that community as a whole constitutes an international crime.\"\n\n\"3. Subject to Paragraph 2, and on the basis of the rules of international law in force, an international crime may result,\" inter alia, \"from:\"\n\n\"(a) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for the maintenance of international peace and security, such as that prohibiting aggression;\"\n\n\"(b) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for safeguarding the right of self-determination of peoples, such as that prohibiting the establishment or maintenance by force of colonial domination;\"\n\n\"(c) a serious breach on a widespread scale of an international obligation of essential importance for safeguarding the human being, such as those prohibiting slavery, genocide and apartheid;\"\n\n\"(d) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for the safeguarding and preservation of the human environment, such as those prohibiting massive pollution of the atmosphere or of the seas.\"\n\n\"4. Any internationally wrongful act which is not an international crime in accordance with paragraph 2 constitutes an international delict.\"\n\nArticle 19 was deleted from the final Draft Articles.\n\nBefore a state can be held responsible for any action, it is necessary to prove a causal connection between the injury and an official act or omission attributable to the state alleged to be in breach of its obligations. This has become an increasingly significant contemporary issue, as non-state actors such as Al Qaeda, multinational corporations, and non-governmental organisations play greater international roles, and as governments privatise some traditional functions.\n\nThe state is responsible for all actions of its officials and organs, even if the organ or official is formally independent and even if the organ or official is acting \"ultra vires\". Persons or entities not classified as organs of the State may still be imputable, when they are otherwise empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, and act in that capacity in the particular instance. Persons or entities not performing public functions may equally be imputable, if they in fact acted under the direction or control of the State. Where there is a breakdown of normal governmental authority and control, such as in so-called \"failed states\", the actions of those acting as the \"government\" in a de facto sense will be acts of the state. The acts of an \"insurrectional or other movement that becomes the new government of an existing state or succeeds in establishing a new state\" can also be attributed to the state. This is also the case where a state acknowledges and adopts the conduct of private persons as its own.\n\nDespite their apparent concreteness, the standards stated in some rules involve important ambiguities, and their application will often require significant fact-finding and judgment. Most rules state responsibility involving private acts already arise under primary rules. For example, environmental and human rights agreements require states to prevent abuses by private parties.\n\nIf the general elements to establish state responsibility are established, the question arises as to whether any defences may be available to the respondent state.\n\nThese include \"force majeure\" (Article 23), distress (Article 24), state of necessity (Article 25) and counter measures (Articles 49-52), self-defence (article 21) and consent (article 20).\n\nThe breach of an international obligation entails two types of legal consequences. Firstly, it creates new obligations for the breaching state, principally, duties of cessation and non-repetition (Article 30), and a duty to make full reparation (Article 31). Article 33(1) characterises these secondary obligations as being owed to other states or to the international community as a whole. Articles indirectly acknowledges in a savings clause also that states may owe secondary obligations to non-state actors such as individuals or international organisations.\n\nSecond, the articles create new rights for injured states, principally, the right to invoke responsibility (Articles 42 and 48) and a limited right to take countermeasures (Articles 49-53). These rights, however, are heavily state-centred and do not deal with how state responsibility is to be implemented if the holder of the right is an individual or an organisation. The principal element of progressive development in this area is Article 48, which provides that certain violations of international obligations can affect the international community as a whole such that state responsibility can be invoked by states on behalf of the larger community. This provision picks up on the ICJ's celebrated suggestion in \"Barcelona Traction\" that some obligations are owed \"erga omnes\", toward the international community as a whole.\n\nIf illegal actions are continuing, the state has a duty to cease. The state also has duties to make reparation, which could involve restitution, compensation, or satisfaction. Remedies will be dependent on the particular forum, such as the United Nations, International Court of Justice, World Trade Organization, International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, International Criminal Court, and on the purpose of reparation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56769224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56769224", "title": "Taoist philosophy", "text": "Taoist philosophy\n\nTaoist philosophy (Chinese: 道家; pinyin: \"dàojiā\"; lit. \"school or family of the Tao\") also known as Taology (Chinese: 道學; pinyin: \"dàoxué\"; lit. \"learning of the Tao\") refers to the various philosophical currents of Taoism, a tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the \"Tao\" (, also romanized as \"Dao\"). The \"Tao\" is a mysterious and deep principle that is the source, pattern and substance of the entire universe.\n\nThroughout its history, Taoist philosophy has emphasized concepts like \"wu wei\" (effortless action), \"ziran\" (\"naturalness\"), yin and yang, \"Ch'i\" (\"life energy\")\",\" \"Wu\" (non-being), and personal cultivation through meditation and other spiritual practices. Taoism differs from Confucianism in putting more emphasis on physical and spiritual cultivation and less emphasis on political organization.\n\nSince the initial stages of Taoist thought, there have been varying schools of Taoist philosophy and they have drawn from and interacted with other philosophical traditions such as Confucianism and Buddhism. While scholars have sometimes attempted to separate \"Taoist philosophy\" from \"Taoist religion\", there was never really such a separation. Taoist texts and the literati and Taoist priests that wrote and commented on them never made the distinction between \"religious\" and \"philosophical\" ideas, particularly those related to metaphysics and ethics.\n\nThe major texts of this loose philosophical tradition are traditionally seen as the Tao Te Ching, and the Zhuangzi, though it was only during the Han Dynasty that they were grouped together under the label \"Taoist\" (\"Daojia\"). The I Ching was also later linked to this tradition by scholars like Wang Bi.\n\nCompared to other philosophical traditions, Taoist philosophy is quite heterogeneous. According to Russell Kirkland, \"Taoists did not generally regard themselves as followers of a single religious community that shared a single set of teachings, or practices.\" Instead of drawing on a single book or the works of one founding teacher, Taoism developed out a widely diverse set of Chinese beliefs and texts, that over time were gathered together into various synthetic traditions. These texts had some things in common, especially ideas about personal cultivation and integration with what they saw as the deep realities of life.\n\nThe first group consciously identifying itself as \"Taoist\" (\"dàojiào\") appeared and began to collect texts during the fifth century CE. Their collection of Taoist texts did not initially include classics typically considered to be \"Taoist\" like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi. Only after a later expansion of the canon did these texts become included.\n\nThe legend of the \"person\" Laozi was developed during the Han dynasty and has no historical validity. Likewise the labels Taoism and Confucianism were developed during the Han dynasty by scholars to group together various thinkers, and texts of the past and categorize them as \"Taoist\", even though they are quite diverse and their authors may never have known of each other. Thus, while there was never a coherent \"school\" of \"classical Taoism\" during the pre-Han eras, later self identified Taoists (c. 500 CE) were influenced by streams of thought, practices and frameworks inherited from the period of the hundred schools of thought (6th century to 221 BC). According to Russell Kirkland, these independent influences include:\n\nThe Tao Te Ching (also known as the Laozi, terminus ante quem third century BCE) has traditionally been seen as the central and founding Taoist text, though historically, it is only one of the many different influences on Taoist thought, and at times, a marginal one at that. The Laozi changed and developed over time possibly from a tradition of oral sayings, and is a loose collection of aphorisms on various topics which seek to give the reader wise advice on how to live, govern and also includes some metaphysical speculations. The Laozi commonly mentions the idea of a subtle universal force or cosmic creative power called Tao (literally \"way\" or \"road\"), using feminine and maternal imagery to describe it. Tao is the natural spontaneous way that things arise and exist, it is the \"organic order\" of the universe. The Laozi states that the true Tao cannot be captured by language (cannot be named).\n\nThe Laozi also mentions the concept of wu wei (effortless or non-forceful action), which is illustrated with water analogies (going with the flow of the river instead of against) and \"encompasses shrewd tactics—among them “feminine wiles”— which one may utilize to achieve success\". Wu wei is associated with yielding, minimal action and softness. Wu wei is the activity of the ideal sage (\"sheng ren\"), who spontaneously and effortlessly express Te (virtue), acting as one with the universal forces of the Tao, resembling children or un-carved wood (pu). They concentrate their internal energies, are humble, pliable and content and move naturally without being restricted by the structures of society and culture. The Laozi also provides advice for rulers, such as never standing out, keeping weapons but not using them, keeping the people simple and ignorant and working in subtle unseen ways instead of forceful ones. It has generally been seen as promoting minimal government.\n\nLike the Tao Te Ching, the lesser known Nei-yeh (literally: \"Inner cultivation\") is another short wisdom sayings text but with a different focus. The Nei-yeh is an important early textual source for Taoist personal cultivation of the heartmind (\"hsiu-hsin\"), which advocated the cultivation and refinement of ch’i (“life-energy”), ching (“vital essence”), and shen (“spirit”). The Nei-yeh's idea of a pervasive and unseen \"vital force or energy\" called ch'i and its relationship to acquiring Te (virtue or inner power) was very influential for later Taoist philosophy. Similarly, important Taoist ideas such as the relationship between a person’s \"hsing\" (“inner nature”) and their \"ming\" (“life-realities”) can be found in another lesser known text called the Lüshi Chunqiu. In these texts, as well as in the Laozi, a person who acquires Te and has a balanced and tranquil heartmind is called a \"sheng-jen\" (“sage”). According to Russell Kirkland: The “heart/mind” is the ruling agency within an individual’s biospiritual nexus, i.e., in the entire personal complex of body/mind/heart/spirit. The Nei-yeh’s principal teaching is that a person should work constantly to ensure that his/her “heart/mind” is balanced and tranquil—without excessive cogitation or emotion. If one maintains a tranquil “heart/ mind,” one will become a receptor of life’s healthful energies, and will be able to retain them and live a long life.Another text called the Zhuangzi is also seen as a classic of Taoism though it was also often a marginal work for Chinese Taoists. It contains various ideas such as the idea that society and morality is a relative cultural construct, and that the sage is not bound by such things and lives, in a sense, beyond them. The Zhuangzi's vision for becoming a sage requires one to empty oneself of conventional social values and cultural ideas and to cultivate wu wei. Some scholars see primitivist ideas in the Zhuangzi, advocating a return to simpler forms of life.\n\nAccording to Kirkland what these three texts have in common is the idea that \"one can live one’s life wisely only if one learns how to live in accord with life’s unseen forces and subtle processes, not on the basis of society’s more prosaic concerns\". These subtle forces include ch'i, Tao, and shen (spirit).\n\nLater Taoists incorporated concepts from the I Ching, like Tian (heaven). According to Livia Kohn, Tian is \"a process, an abstract representation of the cycles and patterns of nature, a nonhuman force that interacted closely with the human world in a nonpersonal way.\"\n\nThe term \"Daojia\" (usually translated as \"philosophical Taoism\") was coined during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) by scholars and bibliographers to refer to a grouping of classic texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi. Though there were no self termed \"Taoists\" during the Han dynasty, ideas which were later important to \"Taoists\" can be seen in Han texts such as the \"Huainanzi\" and the \"Taipingjing\". According to the \"Taipingjing\" (Scripture of Grand Tranquility) for example, the ideal ruler maintains an \"air\" (\"ch'i\") of grand tranquility (\"t'ai-p'ing\") through the practice of wu wei, meditation, longevity practices such as breath control and medicinal practices like acupuncture. There also commentaries written on the classics, the earliest commentary on the \"Dao De Jing\" is that of Heshang Gong (the \"Riverside Master\").\n\nAnother influence to the development of later Taoism was \"Huáng-Lǎo\" (literally: \"Yellow [Emperor] Old [Master]\"), one of the most influential Chinese school of thought in the early Han dynasty (2nd-century BCE). It was a syncretist philosophy which brought together texts and elements from many schools. Huang–Lao philosophy was favored at the Western Han, before the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) who made Confucianism the official state philosophy. These intellectual currents helped inspire several new social movements such as the Way of the Celestial Masters which would later influence Taoist thought.\n\nThe fourth century saw major developments such as the rise of new spiritual traditions like the Shangqing (\"Supreme Clarity\") and Lingbao (\"Numinous Treasure\") with new scriptures and practices such as alchemy and visualization meditations as a way of moral and spiritual refinement. It was the Lingbao school who also developed the ideas of a great cosmic deity as a personification of the Tao and a heavenly order with Mahayana Buddhist influences. The Shangqing school is the beginning of the Taoist tradition known as “inner alchemy” (\"neidan\"), a form of physical and spiritual self cultivation.\n\nIt was in the later fifth century that an aristocratic scholar called Lu Xiujing (406-477) drew on all these disparate influences to shape and produce a common set of beliefs, texts and practices for what he called \"the teachings of the Tao” (Tao-chiao). In the north, another influential figure, Kou Qianzhi (365–448), reformed the celestial master school, producing a new ethical code.\n\nXuanxue (lit. \"mysterious\" or \"deep\" learning, sometimes called Neo-Taoism\")\" was an important school of thought from the third to sixth century CE. Xuanxue philosophers combined elements of Confucianism and Taoism to reinterpret the \"Yijing,\" \"Daodejing,\" and \"Zhuangzi.\" Influential Xuanxue scholars include Wang Bi (226-249), He Yan (d. 249), Xiang Xiu (223?-300, part of the famous intellectual group known as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove), Guo Xiang (d. 312), and Pei Wei (267-300).\n\nThinkers like He Yan and Wang Bi are set forth the theory that everything, including yin and yang and the virtue of the sage, “have their roots\" in \"wu\" (nothingness, negativity, not-being). What He Yan seems to mean by \"wu\" can be variously described as formlessness and undifferentiated wholeness. Wu is property-less and yet full and fecund.\n\nWang Bi's commentary has traditionally been the most influential philosophical commentary on the Laozi. Like He Yan, Wang Bi focuses on the concept of \"Wu\" (non-being, nothingness) as the nature of the Tao and underlying ground of existence. Wang Bi's view of Wu is that it is indeed \"not being as a necessary basis of being.\" For being to be possible, there must be not-being, and as the Laozi states, “Dao gives birth to [\"sheng\"] one” and “all things in the world are born of something (\"you\"); something is born of nothing (\"wu\")”. Wang Bi's account focuses on this foundational aspect of not-being. According to Livia Kohn, for Wang Bi \"nonbeing is at the root of all and needs to be activated in a return to emptiness and spontaneity, achieved through the practice of nonaction, a decrease in desires and growth of humility and tranquility\". Another critical concept for Xuanxue philosopher is ziran (lit. \"self-so\", naturalness, spontaneity).\n\nGuo Xiang is also another influential Xuanxue thinker. In his commentary to the Zhuangzi, he rejected that \"wu\" was the source of the generation of beings, instead arguing for spontaneous “self-production” (\"zi sheng\") and “self-transformation” (\"zi hua\" or \"du hua\"):“Because \"wu\" [by definition] is not being, it cannot produce being. Prior to the coming to be of being, it cannot produce other beings. In that case, then, who or what brought about the birth of being? [The answer can only be that] beings are spontaneously self-generated”Another key figure, Taoist alchemist Ge Hong (c. 283–343) was an aristocrat and government official during the Jin Dynasty who wrote the classic known as the Baopuzi (\"Master Embracing Simplicity\"), a key Taoist philosophical work of this period. This text includes Confucian teachings and also spiritual practices meant to aid in attaining immortality and a heavenly state called \"great clarity\", which had great influence on later Taoism.\n\nA later Xuanxue thinker, Zhang Zhan (ca. 330–400), is known particularly for his commentary on the Liezi. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420–589), \"Xuanxue\" reached the height of influence as it was admitted into the official curriculum of the imperial academy.\n\nBy Tang dynasty times (618–907 CE), a common sense of a \"Taoist identity\" had developed (which Tang leaders called Tao-chiao, \"teachings of the Tao\"), partly by the efforts of systematizers like Lu Xiujing and also due to the need to compete against Buddhism for imperial patronage. This synthetic system is sometimes called the Three Caverns. They collected the first Taoist canon, often called the San-tung (“The Three Arcana”), which did not originally include the Tao Te Ching. Taoism also gained official status in China during the Tang Dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative. The Gaozong Emperor even added the \"Tao Te Ching\" to the list of classics (\"jing,\" 經) to be studied for the imperial examinations. This was the height of Taoist influence in Chinese history.\n\nSima Chengzhen (647—735) is an important intellectual figure of this period. He is especially known for blending Taoist, and Buddhist theories and forms of mental cultivation in the Taoist meditation text called the \"Zuowanglun.\" He also served as an adviser to the Tang government. He was later retroactively appropriated as a patriarch of the Quanzhen school.\n\nAnother key Taoist writer and thinker of this period is Du Guangting (850—933), he produced an influential commentary on the Tao Te Ching as well as numerous expositions of other scriptures and histories. Likewise, Taoist master Ch’eng Hsüan-ying (fl. 631-652) wrote an influential commentaries on the Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nThe Song dynasty (960–1279) era saw the foundation of the Quanzhen (Complete perfection or Integrating perfection) school of Taoism during the 12th century among followers of Wang Chongyang (1113–1170), a scholar who wrote various collections of poetry and texts on living a Taoist life who taught that \"spiritural immortality” (shen-hsien) can be attained within this life by entering seclusion, cultivating one’s internal spiritual realities (hsing), and harmonizing them with the realities of one’s external life (ming).\" The Quanzhen school was syncretic, combining elements from Buddhism (such as monasticism) and Confucianism with past Taoist traditions. \"Neidan\", a form of internal alchemy, became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect. Wang Chongyang taught that the \"three teachings\" (Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism), \"when investigated, prove to be but one school.\" He taught that, by mental training and asceticism through which one reaches a state of no-mind (\"Wu Xin\" 無心) and no-thoughts, attached to nothing, one can recover the primordial, deathless \"Radiant Spirit\" or \"Real Nature\" (\"yangshen/zhenxing\").\n\nAccording to Stephen Eskildsen, Wang Chongyang appears to have been familiar with and influenced by Mahayana Buddhist texts like the Diamond sutra as well as Chan texts, however:Wang Zhe did not abide by the thoroughgoing negation and non-assertion of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. Fond as he was of borrowing Buddhist language to preach detachment from this provisional, fleeting world of samsara, Wang Zhe ardently believed in the eternal, universal Real Nature/Radiant Spirit that is the ground and wellspring of consciousness (spirit [shen], Nature [xing]), and vitality (qi, Life [ming]) within all living beings. This to him was not “empty” (lacking inherent existence); it was fully Real (zhen).One Quanzhen master, Qiu Chuji, became a teacher of Genghis Khan before the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty. Originally from Shanxi and Shandong, the sect established its main center in Beijing's Baiyunguan (\"White Cloud Monastery\"). Several Song emperors, most notably Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the \"Daozang.\" \nThe Yuan and Ming government meanwhile often attempted to control and regulate Taoism. Taoism suffered a significant setback during the reign of Khubilai Khan when many copies of the \"Daozang\" were ordered burned in 1281. This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself. Chinese Taoists during the 12-14th centuries engaged in a revaluation of their tradition, dubbed by some a \"reformation\", which focused on individual cultivation.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the state promoted the notion that “the Three Teachings (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) are one”, an idea which was over time became popular consensus. The current Taoist textual canon, called the Daozang, was compiled during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Moreover, during the Ming dynasty, Taoist ideas also influenced Neo-Confucian thinkers like Wang Yangming and Zhan Ruoshui.\n\nThe late Ming and early Qing dynasty saw the rise of the Longmen (Dragon Gate 龍門) school of Taoism, founded by Wang Kunyang (d. 1680) which reinvigorated the Quanzhen tradition. Longmen Taoist writers such as Liu Yiming (1734–1821) also simplified Taoist “Inner Alchemy” practices making more accessible to the public by removing much of the esoteric symbolism of medieval texts. It was Min Yide (1758-1836) though that became the most influential figure of the Longmen lineage, as he was the main compiler of the Longmen \"Daozang xubian\" and doctrine. It was Min Yide who also made the famous text known as The Secret of the Golden Flower along with its emphasis on internal alchemy, the central doctrinal scripture of the Longmen tradition.\n\nThe fall of the Ming Dynasty was blamed by some Chinese literati on Taoist influences and therefore they sought to return to a pure form of Han Confucianism during a movement called \"Hanxue\", or \"Han Learning\" which excluded Taoism. The study and practice of Taoist philosophy saw a steep decline in the more tumultuous times of the later Qing dynasty. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Taoism had declined considerably, and only one complete copy of the \"Daozang\" still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing.\n\nTaoism continued to decline during the Guomindang (Chinese Nationalist Party), who saw religions as parasitic and reactionary and confiscated temples. Taoist decline was accelerated after the rise of the Communist Party of China. During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, many Taoist temples and sites were damaged and taoist clergy were sent to labor camps.\n\nPersecution of Taoists stopped in 1979, and many Taoists began reviving their traditions. Subsequently, many temples and monasteries have been repaired and reopened. Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the PRC, which regulates its activities through the China Taoist Association.\n\n"}

{"id": "1922779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922779", "title": "The Social Contract", "text": "The Social Contract\n\nThe Social Contract, originally published as On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Rights () by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is a 1762 book in which Rousseau theorized about the best way to establish a political community in the face of the problems of commercial society, which he had already identified in his \"Discourse on Inequality\" (1754).\n\n\"The Social Contract\" helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. \"The Social Contract\" argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate. Rousseau asserts that only the people, who are sovereign, have that all-powerful right.\n\nThe epigraph of the work is \"foederis aequas / Dicamus leges\" (Virgil, \"Aeneid\" XI.321–22). The stated aim of \"The Social Contract\" is to determine whether there can be a legitimate political authority, since people's interactions he saw at his time seemed to put them in a state far worse than the good one they were at in the state of nature, even though living in isolation. He concludes book one, chapter three with, \"Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers\", which is to say, the ability to coerce is not a legitimate power, and there is no rightful duty to submit to it. A state has no right to enslave a conquered people.\n\nIn this desired social contract, everyone will be free because they all forfeit the same number of rights and impose the same duties on all. Rousseau argues that it is absurd for a man to surrender his freedom for slavery; thus, the participants must have a right to choose the laws under which they live. Although the contract imposes new laws, including those safeguarding and regulating property, there are restrictions on how that property can be legitimately claimed. His example with land includes three conditions; that the land be uninhabited, that the owner claims only what is needed for subsistence, and that labor and cultivation give the possession legitimacy.\n\nRousseau posits that the political aspects of a society should be divided into two parts. First, there must be a sovereign consisting of the whole population, women included, that represents the general will and is the legislative power within the state. The second division is that of the government, being distinct from the sovereign. This division is necessary because the sovereign cannot deal with particular matters like applications of the law. Doing so would undermine its generality, and therefore damage its legitimacy. Thus, government must remain a separate institution from the sovereign body. When the government exceeds the boundaries set in place by the people, it is the mission of the people to abolish such government, and begin anew.\n\nRousseau claims that the size of the territory to be governed often decides the nature of the government. Since a government is only as strong as the people, and this strength is absolute, the larger the territory, the more strength the government must be able to exert over the populace. In his view, a monarchical government is able to wield the most power over the people since it has to devote less power to itself, while a democracy the least. In general, the larger the bureaucracy, the more power required for government discipline. Normally, this relationship requires the state to be an aristocracy or monarchy. When Rousseau uses the word democracy, he refers to a direct democracy rather than a representative democracy. In light of the relation between population size and governmental structure, Rousseau argues that, like his native Geneva, small city-states are the form of nation in which freedom can best flourish. For states of this size, an elected aristocracy is preferable, and in very large states a benevolent monarch; but even monarchical rule, to be legitimate, must be subordinate to the sovereign rule of law.\n\nThe French philosopher Voltaire used his publications to criticise and mock Rousseau, but also to defend free expression. In his \"Idées républicaines\" (1765), he reacted to the news that \"The Social Contract\" had been burned in Geneva, saying \"The operation of burning it was perhaps as odious as that of writing it. […] To burn a book of argument is to say: 'We do not have enough wit to reply to it.'\" The work was also banned in Paris.\n\nThe work received a refutation called \"The Confusion of the Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau\" by the Jesuit Alfonso Muzzarelli in Italy in 1794.\n\n\n"}

If two theories could not, for practical reasons, be tested one should prefer the one with the highest degree of empirical content, said Popper in \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\".\n\nMathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré instead, like many others, proposed simplicity as a criterion. One should choose the mathematically simplest or most elegant approach. Many have sympathized with this view, but the problem is that the idea of simplicity is highly intuitive and even personal, and that no one has managed to formulate it in precise and acceptable terms.\n\nPopper's solution was subsequently criticized by Thomas S. Kuhn in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". He denied that competing theories (or paradigms) could be compared in the way that Popper had claimed, and substituted instead what can be briefly described as pragmatic success. This led to an intense discussion with Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend the best known participants.\n\nThe discussion has continued, but no general and uncontroversial solution to the problem of formulating objective criteria to decide which is the best theory has so far been formulated. The main criteria usually proposed are to choose the theory which provides the best (and novel) predictions, the one with the highest explanatory potential, the one which offers better problems or the most elegant and simple one. Alternatively a theory may be preferable if it is better integrated into the rest of contemporary knowledge.\n"}

Samuel Brown (d.1779) (minister of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale) and Mary Smith.\n\nTheir son was a wide reader and an eager student. Educated at several schools in London, he went to the University of Edinburgh in 1792, where he attended Dugald Stewart's moral philosophy class, but does not appear to have completed his course. After studying law for a time he took up medicine; his graduation thesis \"De Somno\" was well received. But his strength lay in metaphysical analysis.\n\nBrown set an answer to the objections raised against the appointment of Sir John Leslie to the mathematical professorship (1805). Leslie, a follower of David Hume, was attacked by the clerical party as a sceptic and an infidel, and Brown took the opportunity to defend Hume's doctrine of causality as in no way inimical to religion. His defence, at first only a pamphlet, became in its third edition a lengthy treatise entitled \"Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect\", and is a fine specimen of Brown's analytical faculty.\n\nIn 1806, Brown became a medical practitioner in partnership with James Gregory (1753–1821), but, though successful, preferred literature and philosophy. After twice failing to gain a professorship in the university, he was invited, during an illness of Dugald Stewart in the session of 1808–1809, to act as his substitute, and during the following session he undertook much of Stewart's work. The students received him with enthusiasm, due partly to his splendid rhetoric and partly to the novelty and ingenuity of his views. In 1810 he was appointed as colleague to Stewart, a position which he held for the rest of his life. Brown was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815. He wrote his lectures at high pressure, and devoted much time to the editing and publication of the numerous poems which he had written at various times during his life. He was also preparing an abstract of his lectures as a handbook for his class. His health, never strong, gave way under the strain of his work.\n\nHe was advised to take a trip to London, where he died in 1820 aged 42. His body was returned to Kirkmabreck for burial.\n\nOne of Brown's notable works included a critique of Erasmus Darwin's theory of transmutation. The philosopher published it in the form of a detailed study \"Observations on the zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin\" (1798), which was recognized as a mature work of criticism.\n\nThere, Brown wrote:\nNoteworthy, Brown's criticism of the Darwinian thesis, like that of Rudolf Virchow, did not come from any religious feeling.\n\nBrown's philosophy occupies an intermediate place between the earlier Scottish school and the later associational psychology, to which he really belonged. Later criticism of Brown's philosophy lessened its popularity, a severe attack being made by Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet in his \"Discussions\" and \"Lectures on Metaphysics\". A high estimate of his merits was shown in John Stuart Mill's \"Examination of Hamilton\". Also, in David Welsh's \"Account of the Life and Writings\" (1825) and James McCosh's \"Scottish Philosophy\". Friedrich Eduard Beneke, who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines.\n\nThe philosopher Schopenhauer wrote of him in 1844:\n\nQuite recently Thomas Brown has taught ... in his extremely tedious book \"Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect\" (4th ed., 1835), ... that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and instinctive conviction; he is therefore essentially on the right path. However, the crass ignorance is unpardonable by which, in this book of 476 pages, 130 of which are devoted to the refutation of Hume, no mention at all is made of Kant, who cleared up the matter seventy years ago.|\"The World as Will and Representation\", Vol. II, Chapter IV\n\nIn his \"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason\", § 20, Schopenhauer claimed that Brown intended to provide support for the Cosmological Proof of God’s Existence. \"… sometimes there is an intention…a theological design flirting with the Cosmological Proof…. We find the clearest instance of this in Thomas Browne’s [sic] book, \"On the Relation of Cause and Effect\"…this Englishman rightly recognizes, that the causal law has invariably to do with \"changes\", and that every effect is accordingly a \"change\". Yet…he is unwilling to admit that every cause is likewise a \"change\" and that the whole process is therefore nothing but the uninterrupted connection of \"changes\" succeeding one another in time. On the contrary, he persists in clumsily calling the cause an \"object or substance, which precedes the change\"…in order that his definition may on no account stand in the way of the Cosmological Proof….\"\n\nHis friend and biographer, David Welsh (1793–1845), superintended the publication of Brown's text-book, the \"Physiology of the Human Mind\", and his \"Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind\", which was published by his successors, John Stewart and Edward Milroy. The \"Lectures\" were well received both in England (where it reached a 19th edition) and in the USA.\n\nAmong Brown's poems, which were influenced by Alexander Pope and Akenside were: \"Paradise of Coquettes\" (1814); \"Wanderer in Norway\" (1815); \"Warfiend\" (1816); \"Bower of Spring\" (1817); \"Agnes\" (1818); \"Emily\" (1819); a collected edition in 4 vols. appeared in 1820. His poetry, though graceful, lacked force, and is now forgotten.\n\nBrown was one of the first contributors to the \"Edinburgh Review\". In its second number, he published a criticism of Immanuel Kant's philosophy, based on Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's account of it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15564482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15564482", "title": "Thomas Talbott", "text": "Thomas Talbott\n\nThomas Talbott is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Willamette University, Salem, Oregon. He is best known for his advocacy of trinitarian universalism. Due to his book \"The Inescapable Love of God\" and other works he is one of the most prominent Protestant voices today supporting the idea of universal salvation. The 2003 book \"Universal Salvation?: The Current Debate\" presents Talbott's \"rigorous defense of universalism\" together with responses from various fields theologians, philosophers, church historians and other religious scholars supporting or opposing Talbott's universalism. Talbott contributed the chapter on \"Universalism\" for \"The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology\".\n\nTalbott has offered three propositions which many traditional Christians consider are biblically based but Talbott considers can not all be true at the same time:\n\nHowever those objecting to Talbott's view note that there are multiple biblical verses describing hell as the fate of the wicked. Traditionally;\n\nIn the September 1987 edition of the periodical \"Christian Scholar's Review\", Talbott sought, as he explains in a more recent comment, \"to make some ideas then current in the philosophical literature available to a wider audience of non-philosophers.\" He sought to explain, for example, how Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense had transformed the way in which contemporary philosophers approach the so-called problem of evil and why, in particular, even atheistic philosophers came to abandon the claim that evil is \"logically inconsistent\" with the existence of God. But at the end of this article, Talbott also ventured into more controversial territory, suggesting ways in which even the tragic suffering of innocent children might contribute, in the end, to the future blessedness of all people (including the children who suffer). In accordance with his affirmation of universal reconciliation, he thus expressed the hopeful belief that \"every innocent child who suffers will one day look upon that suffering as a privilege because of the joy it has made possible: the joy of knowing that one has been used by God in the redemption of others, the joy of that final union or reunion in which love's triumph is complete and all separation from others is finally overcome. I would ask but two things of those who [might understandably] reject such a view: first, that they resist the temptation to moralize, and second, that they consider the alternatives carefully.\"\n\nOthers have, not surprisingly, roundly criticized and even ridiculed such a view. According to John Beversluis, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Butler University, for example, Talbott's view is \"so outrageous...that I will not dignify it with a reply...If Talbott is right, he is logically committed and morally obliged to oppose everyone dedicated to alleviating world hunger, ridding the world of terrorism, finding a cure for cancer...and so forth.\" But in an equally hard-hitting reply, Talbott dismisses this claim by comparing it to a more precise claim of the following form: \"If Talbott is right in accepting [proposition] \"p\" (where \"p\" is specifically identified), then Talbott is logically committed to \"q\".\" He then points out that a cogent argument in the present context would require two things of Beversluis: \"first, that he identify a relevant instance of \"p\", and second, that he make some attempt to deduce \"q\" from \"p\". But Beversluis,\" Talbott insists, \"does not so much as identify the proposition that he claims logically commits me to the moral obligation he alleges; much less does he make the required deduction.\" \n\nTalbott acknowledges, however, that his optimistic view could be regarded as a case of wishful thinking. But he goes on to contrast hope with despair, arguing that, unlike despair, hope is compatible with a healthy skepticism. For whereas despair typically rests upon a set of dogmatic beliefs about the future, hope does not.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2971986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2971986", "title": "Transnational feminism", "text": "Transnational feminism\n\nTransnational feminism refers to both a contemporary feminist paradigm and the corresponding activist movement. Both the theories and activist practices are concerned with how globalization and capitalism affect people across nations, races, genders, classes, and sexualities. This movement asks to critique the ideologies of traditional white, classist, western models of feminist practices from an intersectional approach and how these connect with labor, theoretical applications, and analytical practice on a geopolitical scale.\n\nThe term \"transnational\" is reaction and the rejection of terms like \"international\" and \"global\" feminism. Transnational feminists believe that the term \"international\" puts more emphasis on nation-states as distinct entities, and that \"global\" speaks to liberal feminist theories on \"global sisterhood\" that ignore Third World women and women of color's perspectives on gender inequality and other problems globalization inherently brings.\n\nThe transnational feminist academic paradigm draws from postcolonial feminist theories, which emphasize how colonialist legacies have shaped and continue to shape the social, economic, and political oppression of people across the globe. It rejects the idea that people from different regions have the same subjectivities and experiences with gender inequality, it further recognizes that global capitalism has created similar relations of exploitation and inequality, this core concept creates dialogue which feminists around the world can find solidarity and seek collaboration. Transnational feminism further complicates global capitalism and neoliberalism.\n\nTransnational feminist practice is involved in activist movements across the globe that work together to understand the role of gender, the state, race, class, and sexuality in critiquing and resisting structures of patriarchal, capitalist power. It is attentive to feminism as both a liberatory formation and a practice that has been oppressed by and sometimes been complicit with colonialism, racism, and imperialism. As such, it resists utopian ideas about \"global sisterhood\" while simultaneously working to lay the groundwork for more productive and equitable social relations among women across borders and cultural contexts.\n\nTransnational feminist theorists and practitioners vary in how they phrase \"transnational feminism\". Variations include \"transnational feminisms\", or \"transnational feminist praxis\" and \"transnational practices\"\n\nAmanda Swarr and Richa Nagar, in their book \"Critical Transnational Feminist Praxis\", give a list of the now outdated terms that describe transnational feminist practices. They emphasize that, like these \"rejects\", the term \"transnational\" feminisms is merely a product of its time in the U.S. and Canadian academic institutions. Before, the terms were \" \"women of color\" feminisms (Combahee River Collective 1982), \"third world\" feminisms (Mohanty et al. 1991), \"Multicultural feminisms (e.g. Shohat 1998)\", \"international (Enloe 1990)\" and \"global\" feminisms (e.g., Morgan 1984).\" Currently, \"transnational feminism\" is the term that feminists like Chandra Mohanty and Jacqui Alexander, Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan claim has political power and can discard essentialist binaries like First World/Third World, or heteronormative gender constructs. These feminist theorists believed that \"international\" put more emphasis on nation-states as distinct entities, and that \"global\" speaks to liberal feminist theories, like Robin Morgan's concept of \"global sisterhood\", without taking into consideration race, class, culture, or colonialist and imperialist histories.\n\nIn \"Women's studies on its own: a next wave reader in institutional change,\" Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan claim they do not think the term \"transnational\" is better than other \"international\" or \"global\", but that it is useful inasmuch as it is free from the implications that other terms may have:\nCriticisms against the term \"transnational\" claim that because it de-emphasizes the borders between nations and emphasizes the similar concept of global capital flows, it deceptively smooths over large inequalities between nations.\n\nTransnational Feminism in practice can be noted as a means of studying the “other”, a western concept of people not strictly related to the global north. This is the attempt to understand what factors make up their identities and struggles and a way of acknowledging  these experiences have their own complex natures, unique geographically and how this is interpolated by those examining and theorizing.\n\nGlobalization is a process marked by greater political, economic, and social interdependence between all the nations of the world. It arose in the 1970s with greater market expansion.\n\nAs neoliberal ideologies and policies spread in the 1980s and 1990s, more governments started deregulating their markets. In the Third World, governments implemented Structural Adjustment Programs, which espoused the neoliberal ideologies of free trade, increased government deregulation, and reduced welfare and social protection. These practices feminized the labor force.\n\nBecause women in Third world countries are now more involved in the professional workforce, many outsource care work to women in developing countries. This provides more job opportunities for the Third World women but also detracts from the migrants' ability to care for their own children and increases the gap in human capital between the two spheres. Because of this global demand for outsourced labor, women in countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia who would otherwise not have a job now do, and studies have shown that this improves their sense of empowerment and reduces likelihood of domestic abuse.\n\nGlobalization also allows resistances against the spread of neoliberal ideologies. Transnational feminist networks, in which women from all over the world can organize together against gender inequity, would not be possible without the information and travel networks created by globalization.\n\nIn the \"Oxford Handbook of Transnational Feminist Movements\", Valentine Moghadam says that \"women have worked together across borders since at least the mid-1800s. (55)\" What is now called first wave feminism started in the early twentieth century in the West with a focus on women's suffrage. \nDuring World War II, the United States government gave women jobs because the war had caused a national shortage of labor. After the war ended, Irene Tinker says (oxford transnational), these jobs were taken away but women were no longer satisfied going back to their previous gender roles. Starting in the 1960s in the United States, second wave feminism emerged, defined by women's organization around \"equal right to education, employment, and equal pay for equal work, and on sexual and reproductive rights.\" The UN Decade for Women of 1976-1985, and the following four UN conferences on women between 1975 and 1995 were essential in creating transnational feminist networks and putting feminism on a global agenda. \nHowever starting in the 1980s there was a separation between Western feminists and Third World feminists. This occurred largely because Western feminists largely subscribed to liberal feminist perspectives, which focused on the common patriarchal oppressor of women, defined by its confining women to the household and traditional work. Liberal feminists propose that women break this oppression by leaving their traditional roles in the household, becoming educated, and entering the labor force. Women in the global South often felt that Western feminism did not represent them and align with their struggles. They felt that Western feminism was ethnocentric and assumed all women had similar situations. Scholars like Chandra Talpade Mohanty plays an integral role in articulating concerns about Western feminism's failure to account for non-Western subjects. She critiques feminism during this time period to be more inclusive of intersectional struggles, identifying that feminism and inequalities are not linear, and the idea of female being a basis of shared oppression invisibilized the individual within their specific context and time. Upon realizing that the common phenomena of capitalist globalization was causing women all over the world to be disproportionately affected (CITE), transnational feminist movements allied together and helped to consolidate the field of transnational feminism.\n\nThe theory termed \"transnational feminism\" was first used by Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan in 1994 in their seminal text \"Scattered Hegemonies: Postmodernity and Transnational Feminist Practices, which situated transnational feminism among other theories of feminism, modernity, and postmodernity.\"\nSoon after, M. Alexander and Chandra Mohanty published \"Feminist Genealogies, Colonial Legacies, Democratic Futures\" in 1997, a book important in formulating transnational feminist canon. This text, building on Grewal and Kaplan's, focused more on the ways in which a new theory of transnational feminism could help foreground feminist activist practices in global contexts. They talk about \"feminist democracies\" as ways for activists to imagine nonhegemonic futures.\n\nThe practice of transnational feminism networks, in which feminists started exchanging ideas and collaborating across nation-state borders, originated from the United Nations conferences in the 1970s. In 1975 the United Nations Decade of Women began with the United Nations declaration of an International Women's Year. This ushered in a decade of conferences that would continue to the present. Important events during this period included conferences in Mexico City (1975), Copenhagen (1980), Nairobi (1985), and Beijing in 1995.\n\nThese conferences and others facilitated the contact of feminists from all over the globe, allowing for discussions to occur that transcended borders. While so called \"western feminists\", a term for feminists that were \"US-based white, class-privileged women\" had dominated the women's rights movement, when women from other parts of the globe were brought in, they began criticizing this type of women's rights for assuming all women had the same experiences, and not considering the impact of factors such as race, state, economic status had on their lives.\n\nThe theories of WID and GAD also helped to highlight gender related issues that pertained to women worldwide. The establishment of transnational feminist networks did many things, one such thing was creating numerous NGOs. The United Nations conferences were not the only factors leading to the transnationalization of feminism as mentioned, WID and GAD played important roles and so did other global events. As more women globally were gaining greater access to education, obtaining jobs, and becoming more mobile, it allowed for women to more easily meet and communicate. The spread of neoliberalism, poor working conditions, and declining welfare conditions in many countries led many women to find common ground and to subsequently form transnational feminist groups and organizations.\n\nAlthough the term \"transnational\" was chosen for its supposed political power and ability to \"resist or question modernity\", Laura Briggs, in the \"Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory\", claims that \"transnational feminism\" could only be legitimized as a separate field of feminist study when the term \"transnational\" started being used by business schools, education systems, and global corporations in the 1990s. Since then, however, academic institutions have been incorporating transnational feminist studies as categories of study. In 2000, a group of feminists started publishing the journal \"\", in which feminist theorists like Amrita Basu started using the term \"transnational feminism\" to describe a separate and emerging field of feminist studies.\n\nTransnational feminist theories seek to destabilize liberal feminist assumptions that Third World women face the same type of oppression as First World women. \nIn their seminal text\" Scattered Hegemonies: Postmodernity and Transnational Feminist Practices\", the authors Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan posit transnational feminist theory as one that critiques modernity through the lens of feminist theory. This articulation of feminist theory is a revision to the field of postmodernism, which the authors argue is powerful in its critique of modern global capitalism, but inadequate because it does not explore gender or reflect on the consequences of theorizing with a Western background. Without paying attention to how colonial histories and global capital flows allow for different cultures to influence and change each other, postmodernist theorists portray non-Western cultures as essentially different from and marginal to Western cultures. Postmodern does not exemplify the realities of transnational feminism and its relation to the global south, Mohanty states \"postmodernist critique that is skeptical of a systematic analysis of institutionalized power and of decolonizing methodologies that center marginalized experience (women of color epistemology) in struggles for justice is seriously off the mark\". In order for activists around the world to collaborate, they need a theory that both creates solidarity among women all over the globe and recognizes difference. This involves challenging how people from different cultures understand what being a \"woman\" is and can be. Grewal and Kaplan express this sentiment when they say:\n\nThese modern capitalist social formations can include \"humanitarian\" wars waged on behalf of the supposed oppressed women. Laura Bush, along with various western feminist groups such as National Organization for Women and the Feminist Majority Foundation, justified the war in Afghanistan because of \"the human rights abuses committed against Afghani women and girls by the Taliban\". Transnational feminists often oppose such wars, and tend to insist that Western states try to work with local women's rights groups, such as the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA). to ensure the effectiveness of solving the cultural and systematic problem that is affecting those marginalized subjects. Another example of liberal feminist theories going wrong is the ban against wearing Muslim burqas in public. Westerners objected to burqas because they saw them as \"a symbol of subservience\". Transnational feminists argue that banning burqas forces women to conform to \"Euro-patriarchal notions of femininity and dress\", stripping them of their agency to make their own choices.\n\nThere are a number of concerns that many transnational feminists focus on. Issues of gender, imperialism, colonialism, economics, human rights, race, and nationalism encompass many areas of concern.\n\nTransnational feminisms examine how powers of colonialism, modernity, postmodernity, and globalization construct gender norms, or normative conceptions of masculinity and femininity among the subaltern, Third World, and colonized.\n\nSecond-wave feminism in the 1980s started to explore gender instead of sex as a category of distinction between people. With a recognition that biology can identify differences between people, feminists focused on the system of gender norms as an ongoing, changeable process that shaped people's lives and behaviors. This production of critique was largely used in the Global North and is a liberal feminist ideology. Though it did not broaden the discussion of workplace discrimination and reproductive rights for heterosexual female identified people of the first world, this wave was exclusionary of Third world feminist and the global south. Second wave feminism rejected critic of inequalities due to class, race, sex, socioeconomic status, legal status, age, ability and religion.\n\nWith global capitalism causing more people to migrate away from their homes in search of jobs, migration has affected genders unequally, and is thus a key concern in transnational feminisms and feminist economics. Women currently account for roughly half of long-distance migration, and overwhelmingly marginalized women of color bear the burden of global capitalism.\n\nBecause the original design of human rights, particularly as constituted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was designed to fit into specific legal categories, it reflected the \"needs and values of affluent white Western men\" who were the subjects of the legal system. Transnational feminists argue that human rights sometimes do not take into account other conceptions of rights, and do not recognize the experiences of women, in particular those who are \"indigenous, Third World, women of color, poor, rural, disabled and queer\". For example, human rights are geared towards public life and often don't account for the violations of women within their private lives. The private sector is often one of the major focuses of women's rights, including \"domestic violence, the 'double day' of work and family, discrimination against homosexuals, or the denial of reproductive rights\", and even rights tied to keeping these private for women. However, human rights discourse doesn't largely concern itself with these areas. Feminists also critique that these definitions of human rights are often tied too much to the nation-state itself, and that this model discludes \"the majority of women and communities throughout the world\".\n\nFeminists argue that human rights tend also to reinforce power imbalances, giving marginalized people the false assumption that they have rights. In reality these kinds of rights often work more greatly in favor of those already with power, and furthermore that nation-states that already do not care to follow human rights declarations have no incentive to protect women's rights.\n\nRace is a very relevant area of study for transnational feminism as it is concerned with cross-cultural interactions, histories, and migrations. Race plays an important role in shaping not only historical interactions between groups, but also present day migrations. Race also plays an important role in many transnational interactions shaping conceptions of cultures and groups of people. Race is a key component in transnational feminism, race and ethnicity contribute to the complexities of why globalization and neoliberal agendas are imposed on certain groups (colonized; read: marginalized groups) over others (colonizer; read: imperial elitist).\n\nSome transnational feminist groups focus on economic issues. Many of the most important issues to transnational feminists revolve around economics. For many transnational feminists like Mohanty, global capitalism is a serious problem and one that hurts women, particularly Third World women. Mohanty argues strongly against global capitalism. She considers herself an anti-capitalist and is opposed to globalization. Mohanty advocates transnational feminists take similar stances. The expansion of neoliberalism and neoliberal policies are also of concern given their often negative impacts on women. According to Audre Lorde, empowering people who are doing work, like educating others, does not mean using privilege to overstep and overpower groups like educators. Instead, these people must use their privilege to hold the door open for more allies to step in and support groups like educators or less-industrialized groups of women.\n\nColonialism is one of the most important areas of concern for transnational feminism. Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan talk about how colonialism has created situations of gender inequality that continue to disadvantage the lives of women today. Sometimes this inequality takes the form of neocolonialism, which manifests in the way that First World or Western feminists talk about women from the Third World, creating a binary of Us vs. Them rather than developing a cultural understanding of the differences each respective group has. These ways of talking do not consider colonialist histories and tend to portray Third World women as isolated from flows of global capital and information, and therefore passive, helpless, and uninformed. Such Western depictions of non-Western women, Grewal and Kaplan argue, only perpetuate hierarchies that place Western theorists at the superior center and non-Western theorists and people at the inferior margins.\n\nImperialism has had numerous effects on people. Imperialism has often been the impetus for colonialism. Transnational feminism examines not only colonial history, but how imperialism may have contributed to that history. Imperialism is not an issue of only the past, but one of modern-day concern. For example, the United States occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan can be seen as imperialistic in nature. The United States has also had a substantial military presence in Pakistan. Some transnational feminists argue this kind of imperialistic nature has led to the increased fundamentalism and extremism in Pakistan, which can be seen in the Zina laws. The Zina Laws are strict religious laws that regulate extramarital and premarital sex. These laws have very negative effects on women's livelihoods. Transnational feminism looks at the reasons behind the oppression of women. Some feminists might simply look at the oppressive nature of such policies, while many transnational feminists look to how these oppressive policies came to be. By not only examining the issue at hand but depthinging the systematic ideologies such as neocolonialism and imperialism and how those contribute to the initial involvement into that country.\n\nIn her essay \"Postcolonial Legacies\", Geraldine Heng shows how feminism in almost all Third World countries arose as part of nationalistic agendas that were reacting against colonialism and imperialism. Kwame Anthony Appiah talks about how footbinding in China ended when it was seen to represent the weakness of the nation: here, Chinese nationalism enacts its hopes for an anti-imperialist future on the bodies of its women. Some transnational feminist are antagonistic to nationalism because of its history of being a tool of control \"the retrospective activity of nation-building in modernity is always predicated upon women as trope\".\n\nBecause global capitalism is one of the driving forces for much of the inequalities that transnational feminists are addressing with, and nation-states produce and reproduce structures of global capitalism, nation-states are important to look at in transnational feminist practices.\n\nToday, there is also a wave of transnational feminism with \"important currents of feminism are challenging the state-territorial framing of political claims-making\" and that rejects \"the state-territorial frame\" itself. They point out that the actions of one state can and tend to affect the lives of women in surrounding territories, and even throughout the world with more powerful actors. Furthermore, the actions of non-state actors, especially those of international organizations, of the governmental and non-governmental varieties, have huge impacts on the lives of women without consideration of state borders. Likewise, communication at the scale it exists today can alter the lives of women, especially with \"global mass media and cyber technology\". Many of the issues that women around the world face as well are not simply from within state borders, such as sickness and climate change, so the traditional model of the state does not do enough for helping to solve these issues.\n\nSome further claim that this framework of the state further contributes to oppression, as it \"partitions political space in ways that block many women from challenging the forces that oppress them\", especially with the protection international corporations and the current global governance of the economy. Many of the poor and marginalized in the world, especially of the women, are restricted in seeking justice for problems against such large, international corporations. It also takes many groups out of the global decision making, as, with a few exceptions, women are underrepresented at the national level in many states and in many global governance groups. These feminists argue that because women are among the most impoverished and underrepresented of the world, in the current framework of the global nation-state, it is even more difficult for women to attempt to create change, when in order to do so, they must often go against their domestic state or an international corporation, both of which have more resources and influence than a singular or even a small community of women, so this power division and systematic structure seeks to further oppress women.\n\nIn the Introduction for the Oxford Handbook of Transnational Feminist Movements, Rawwida Baksh and Wendy Harcourt define transnational feminist movements as \"the fluid coalescence of organizations, networks, coalitions, campaigns, analysis, advocacy and actions that politicize women's rights and gender equality issues beyond the nation-state, particularly from the 1990s, when deepening globalization and new communications and information technologies (ICTs) enabled feminists to connect readily with a nt interrogate their localities and cross-border relations (4).\" The formation of Transnational Feminist Network organizations requires methods for approaching the conflicts that arise based out of cultural and personal differences of women across the globe. Approaches include dialogue based conversations, flexibility and organization.\n\nSarah E. Dempsey, Patricia S. Parker & Kathleen J. Krone list a number of organizations they consider to be a Transnational Feminist Network in their article \"Navigating Socio-Spatial Difference, Constructing Counter-Space: Insights from Transnational Feminist Praxis\":\n\n\nOther examples of Transnational Feminist Networks include\n\nTransnational Feminist Organizations:\n\nAF3IRM is the first organization to openly and purposefully put transnational feminism into practice. Since 2006, inspired by theorists like Chandra Mohanty, AF3IRM has set out to practice a feminism that builds deeply in local communities and horizontally across national borders, recognizing and being conscious of differences while organizing. AF3IRM is also anti-imperialist, acknowledging and addressing the role United States imperialism and global capitalism plays in the subjugation of women worldwide. It is\n\nGender plays a large role in the allotment of work, quality of work, type of work etc. Women often find themselves in poor working conditions, earning minimal pay, and having little to no channels to protest or negotiate the conditions. Rural agricultural work in Brazil often exemplifies some of these conditions. Transnational feminists take interests in projects to improve gender relations in family agriculture. These feminists wanted to understand the subordination of women agricultural workers and also give the women the tools to increase political discourse. By creating political discourse they could hopefully increase their bargaining power in labor situations. Labor rights are an issue for women not only in Brazil, but all over the world. Transnational feminists in South Africa study and acknowledge the many factors affecting women. Women in South Africa face racial oppression, gender oppression, and subsequently oppression as workers.\n\nTransnational feminism has been criticized for working within the imperialistic framework it has derived from.\n\nA major criticism of transnational feminism lie in the duality of approach to research. While the United States has been seen as a great source for imperialist privilege, Sylvanna Falcón asserts that it is not the US alone that \"practices imperial privilege\".\n\nThis speaks to the level in which \"Western\" feminism is still homogenized as a single experience, even from transnational feminist scholars. Falcón reminds scholars to be mindful of the social location of identities that lie within the area of Western feminism while utilizing a transnational feminist lens. Furthermore, Falcón's assessment of the transnational feminist approach to ontology challenges the \"tendency to secularize US feminist research.\"\n\nOne key critique to transnational feminist research and literature is the obtainment of resources to accurately represent the masses and marginalised people. Falcon suggests \"building of ethics involves relationships and solidarity models, prioritizing collective justice, adopting alternative research models that acknowledge the dimensions of spirituality in relation to ethics\". The need to collect other sources besides elite academic search components to ensure the accessibility of this knowledge. This also challenges academia's tendency to be exclusionary and selective to what is considered valid and noteworthy content. \"Imperialist privilege is one of those contradictory factors in the research process\". To bridge this gap the call for building a research community through seeking out community members, collecting testimonies to people affected by neocolonialism in marginalized communities and involving family members is crucial to creating an organic collective of non-academic, valid knowledge for transnational feminism rhetoric. \nThe challenge Transnational Feminist researchers are faced with is the ability to incorporate ontologies that are relational Falcon, further explains\n\n\"Knowledge production is collective, and we must strive to retain that collective spirit in the organization of our research. As a result, scholars may have to be more creative about their research practices or acknowledge that we do not have the existing methodological tools or ability to research certain dimensions of relational ontologies.\"\n\nThis is not to discourage Transnational feminist but to further critique the modes in which research and academic literature obtains its knowledge. Acknowledging the central nature of feminist research as being imperialist is crucial to understanding how to further improve feminist scholarship.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "167390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167390", "title": "Twin Earth thought experiment", "text": "Twin Earth thought experiment\n\nTwin Earth is a thought experiment by philosopher Hilary Putnam, first in his paper \"Meaning and Reference\" (1973), and then in his paper \"The Meaning of 'Meaning (1975), to illustrate his argument for semantic externalism, or the view that the meanings of words are ultimately not purely psychological. The \"Twin Earth\" thought experiment was one of three, the other two being the \"Aluminum-Molybdenum\", and the \"Beech-Elm\" cases. Since the publication of these cases, philosophers have proposed numerous variations on the experiment.\n\nPutnam's original formulation of the experiment was this: We begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like Earth in virtually all aspects, which we refer to as \"Twin Earth\". (We should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly the same as for Earth; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun, and so on). On Twin Earth, there is a Twin equivalent of every person and thing here on Earth. The one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on Twin Earth. In its place there is a liquid that is superficially identical, but is chemically different, being composed not of HO, but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as \"XYZ\". The Twin Earthlings who refer to their language as \"English\" call XYZ \"water\". Finally, we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago, when the residents of Earth and Twin Earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called \"water\" were HO and XYZ respectively. The experience of people on Earth with water and that of those on Twin Earth with XYZ would be identical.\n\nNow the question arises: when an Earthling (or Oscar for simplicity's sake) and his twin on Twin Earth say 'water' do they mean the same thing? (The twin is also called 'Oscar' on his own planet, of course. Indeed, the inhabitants of that planet call their own planet 'Earth'. For convenience, we refer to this putative planet as 'Twin Earth', and extend this naming convention to the objects and people that inhabit it, in this case referring to Oscar's twin as Twin Oscar.) \"Ex hypothesi\", their brains are molecule-for-molecule identical. Yet, at least according to Putnam, when Oscar says 'water', the term refers to HO, whereas when Twin Oscar says 'water' it refers to XYZ. The result of this is that the contents of a person's brain are not sufficient to determine the reference of terms they use, as one must also examine the causal history that led to this individual acquiring the term. (Oscar, for instance, learned the word 'water' in a world filled with HO, whereas Twin Oscar learned 'water' in a world filled with XYZ.)\n\nThis is the essential thesis of semantic externalism. Putnam famously summarized this conclusion with the statement that meanings' just ain't in the head.\"\n\nIn his original article, Putnam had claimed that the reference of the twins' \"water\" varied even though their psychological states were the same. Tyler Burge subsequently argued in \"Other Bodies\" (1982) that the twins' mental states are different: Oscar has the concept \"HO\", while Twin Oscar has the concept \"XYZ\". Putnam has since expressed agreement with Burge's interpretation of the thought experiment. (See Putnam's introduction in Pessin and Goldberg 1996, xxi.)\n\nA number of philosophers have argued that \"water\" for both Oscar and Twin Oscar refers to anything that is sufficiently water-like (i.e. the term's extension includes both HO and XYZ). They reject, therefore, the contention that \"water\" is a rigid designator referring to HO. John Searle, for example, argues (\"Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind\") that, once we discover that our water is HO, we have the choice of either redefining it as HO (a classical reduction redefinition) or continuing to allow the term water to refer to anything with the basic properties of water (transparency, wetness, etc.). Searle suggests that in the Twin-Earth example, the second seems more plausible, since if Twin Earth doesn't have water, then all its water-based products will also be different. Twin ice cream, for example, will be constitutionally different, yet we will still be tempted to call it ice cream. Searle, along with others, considers this sufficient argument to \"solve\" the thought experiment altogether; others, such as Donald Davidson, feel that variations on the experiment can be used to draw some of the same conclusions.\n\nPaul Boghossian raised an objection to the class of Twin-Earth-style arguments for externalism in the form of an argument that aims to show that externalism is incompatible with privileged self-knowledge. Here, privileged self-knowledge is taken to be the idea that one can know the content of one's thoughts without having to investigate the external world (for empirical evidence). Although this type of argument does not directly disprove externalism, it is pressing because of the intuitive plausibility of privileged self-knowledge's existence.\n\nSome philosophers believe that such science-fiction thought experiments (like the Twin-Earth) should be examined carefully. They argue that when a thought experiment describes a state of affairs that is radically different from the actual one (or what we think it to be), our intuitions can become unreliable, and hence the philosophical conclusions drawn from them may also be unreliable. Daniel Dennett calls Twin Earth and other experiments like it \"intuition pumps\", as they are designed in such a way to allow the thinker to use their intuition to guide them through the problem. Some philosophers take the Twin-Earth thought experiment/intuition pump to engage faulty intuitions, and hence lead to faulty conclusions. Phil Hutchinson, for example, notes that a) if one looks at Putnam's own later criticisms of others (for example his criticisms of Jaegwon Kim in his book \"The Threefold Cord\") one finds that implicitly he criticises his own earlier self; and b) that the persuasive power of the Twin Earth thought experiment/intuition pump relies on our turning a blind eye to aspects of the experiment in order that it establish that which Putnam claims it to. In short, the thought experiment is set up in such a way that one's intuitions will be pumped in the desired direction.\n\nJohn McDowell, in his paper \"Putnam on Mind and Meaning\", criticised Putnam for still having in play a latent commitment to a picture of the mind as modelled on the brain and located in the head. Putnam has since conceded the point and subscribes to McDowell's neo-Wittgensteinian therapeutic invocation of the mind as a structured system of object involving abilities (what Putnam has since defended as a neo-Aristotelian picture of mind). Phil Hutchinson has since argued that this concession to McDowell means that the distinction which Putnam wishes to operationalize, between intension and extension, is now problematized.\n\nJohn Dupré, in a number of papers and mainly in his paper \"Natural Kinds and Biological Taxa\", has demonstrated that the theory of natural kinds, which many have taken to be established and/or supported by Putnam's Twin Earth thought experiment does not find support in the practice of scientific classification. Avrum Stroll has produced probably the most comprehensive critique of the program of natural kind semantics (both Putnam's and Kripke's) in his book \"Sketches of Landscapes\". Putnam, who is well known for changing his philosophical positions on a variety of issues, criticized the experiment later in life because it is anti-functionalist.\n\n\n\n"}

Literally translated as \"cloud plate,\" the umpan is also sounded to \"signal other events,\" such as a call to the conclusion of zazen. Typically one will find an umpan outside the kitchen (J. kuri) or dining hall area. According to Helen J. Baroni, \"Wooden boards (\"han\") hanging on various buildings throughout the temple grounds are sounded simultaneously to alert the members of the community beyond the range of the umpan.\"\n\n\n"}

He received his PhD at Columbia University. He was an editor of \"Partisan Review\" and later the literary critic of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" magazine. He was well known for writing philosophical works for nonexperts. These included \"Irrational Man\" and \"The Illusion of Technique\", which remain in print.\n\nLike many intellectuals of his generation, Barrett flirted with Marxism before turning his energies to providing readable introductions to European philosophical schools, notably existentialism.\n\nBarrett was good friends with the poet Delmore Schwartz for many years. He knew many other literary figures of the day, including Edmund Wilson, Philip Rahv, and Albert Camus. He was deeply influenced by the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Søren Kierkegaard, and Martin Heidegger and was the editor of D. T. Suzuki's 1956 classic \"Zen Buddhism\". In fiction his taste ran to the great Russians, particularly Fyodor Dostoyevsky. \n\nBarrett died in 1992, aged 78, of cancer of the esophagus.\n\nBarrett's Law is named for him: \"not everyone who might read the productions of scholarly writers is an expert in the fields discussed\" (p. 99).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33740268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33740268", "title": "Yoga pants", "text": "Yoga pants\n\nYoga pants are a type of flexible, form-fitting pants designed for the practice of yoga as well as other physical activities that involve a lot of movement, bending and stretching. They are typically worn for sports and physical exercise, martial arts, dancing, pilates, or aerobics. These pants are generally made from a blend of cotton, lycra spandex, nylon, polyester, wool, or a similarly light and stretchy synthetic material giving the pants a very soft, smooth, polished and silky finish when worn. Although designed specifically for yoga, the pants are also casually worn as everyday dress by many women.\n\nAccording to Anu Hastings with the product database Indix, over 2,700 types of so-called \"yoga pants\" are now available on the market. There are various types and styles, including the traditional boot-cut and flared yoga pants with flat waistbands. The typical type of yoga pants traditionally come in black, are tight-fitted, boot-cut, and flared style, are reversible, carry a four way stretch fabric and have a flat elastic waistband folded over at the top. The traditional boot-cut and flared yoga pants with waistbands are the most well-known and most popular type, generally used for casual wear, active wear, lounge wear, maternity wear, dancewear or clubwear. They are tight-fitted, giving them flexibility and comfort as well as the moisture-wicking fabrics within the pants move perspiration away from the body to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate giving the pants an advantage when worn during physical activities that exert heavy perspiration keeping the wearer cool and comfortable.\n\nThe flat and fold-over waists are utilized to provide flexibility, comfort, coverage, style, breathability and versatility. Flat and fold-over waist boot cut and flare yoga pants are commonly used as casual wear, workout and exercise wear, maternity wear, making errands, lounging around the house, yoga class, or as clubwear as women would wear the body-hugging pants to permit freedom of movement when dancing during nights out at their local nightclub. Typically, the more spandex in the yoga pants, the more likely they are used as exercise, dance or clubwear. The more cotton fabrics are more commonly used for loungewear.\n\nThere are various types and styles of yoga pants in addition to the traditional. The flared yoga pants are also commonly used as dancewear allowing it to stretch and for the ease of movement it affords. They also typically have combinations of stretchy fabric blends offered by lycra spandex and nylon giving the pants a rich and silky appearance and feel when worn. Crop-fitted yoga pants lie above the ankle (similar to capri pants), and are oftentimes utilized for a more flattering, versatile, and dressier look during warmer times of the year. They are used commonly as casual wear, activewear, for making errands, lounging or as clubwear on a night out.\n\nThe flared yoga pants are often paired with flip-flops, running shoes, flats, or sheepskin boots, worn along with hoodies, shawls, cardigans or wraps paired with a tank top or shirt tucked underneath. Due to their high elasticity, yoga pants are comfortable enough to wear for many purposes. They were originally created for practicing yoga, but have become popular as everyday mainstream clothing item in classrooms, gymnasiums, restaurants, shopping malls, and nightclubs.\n\nDemand for comfortable active, athletic, sports and casual wear has increased since the turn of the 21st century. Nike, Inc. reported their women's business comprised 7 billion in 2010 and the larger market grew to $33.6 billion by 2015. Nike claims the driving factor has been by the demand for fashionable workout gear that is also flattering. New colors, patterns, and structural design of yoga pants created more versatility and increased their wear in public settings. Author Mae Anderson described the new craze of yoga pants outside the gym by calling them the \"new jeans.\"\n\nMany high-end fashion houses and mass-market trend-chasers have capitalized on the growth of the modern sportswear market, leading an emphasis on technical fabrics and garments that facilitate wearing them as everyday dress. Market research analysts have sought to explain the trend by referencing the extension of work hours in major cities across North America, leading to a \"day-to-night\" than a \"gym-to-work\"—while other explanations cite the North American passion for fitness and healthy living.\n\nIn the United States, reaction to the wider adoption of yoga pants proved somewhat controversial for schools. Some schools adopted dress codes banning yoga pants for all students, or banning them only for female students. \"Bitch\" magazine argued such bans are largely gendered, focusing on the damage caused by \"distraction\" by girls; similar complaints caused a ban in Rockport, Massachusetts, that was quickly reversed.\n\nThere are others who agree with banning yoga pants in public. Most often the reasoning for disagreeing with wearing yoga pants publicly is that they promote a relaxed and informal atmosphere. Amanda Hallay, professor of fashion and cultural history at New York City's LIM College, was interviewed for her opinion on yoga pants being a replacement for jeans. She said, \"Yoga pants are a step above pajamas and we don't wear pajamas out to lunch, and we certainly don't wear them to work. Pajamas are for sleeping in, and ergo, not appropriate to wear in any other setting. The same can be said for yoga pants. Yoga pants are to be worn while doing yoga.\" Yoga pants being worn in public can be perceived as inappropriate and unattractive. According to Hallay, to promote a more business-like or mature persona, a person should dress as such.\n\nIn the U.S. state of Montana, some state House members unsuccessfully attempted to ban the wearing of in public of \"any device, costume, or covering that gives the appearance of or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, anus region, or pubic hair region.\" The author of the legislation, Republican David Moore, acknowledged that the measure could extend to \"tight beige garments\" and stated: \"Yoga pants should be illegal in public anyway.\" Moore later said that the latter comment was an \"off-the-cuff\" joke, although the Associated Press stood by its reporting.\n\n"}
