The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of ontological separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel). A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.\n\nLater developments include Duns Scotus's formal distinction, which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.\n\nSome relevant distinctions to the history of Western philosophy include:\n\nWhile the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British Empiricists (and even further in Scholastic thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in \"All bodies are extended.\" Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in \"All events are caused.\" The distinction was recently called into question by W.V.O. Quine, in his paper \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism.\"\n\nThe origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of knowledge. \"A posteriori\" knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. \"A priori\" knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. Saul Kripke was the first major think to propose that there are analytic \"a posteriori\" knowledge claims.\n\nAristotle makes the distinction between actuality and potentiality. Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by causes, making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.\n\nThe major distinction Aquinas makes is that of essence and existence. It is a distinction already in Avicenna, but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.\n\nIn Kant, the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project. The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.\n"}

{"id": "106540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=106540", "title": "Georg Simmel", "text": "Georg Simmel\n\nGeorg Simmel (; ; 1 March 1858 – 28 September 1918) was a German sociologist, philosopher, and critic.\n\nSimmel was one of the first generation of German sociologists: his neo-Kantian approach laid the foundations for sociological antipositivism, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?', presenting pioneering analyses of social individuality and fragmentation. For Simmel, culture referred to \"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history\". Simmel discussed social and cultural phenomena in terms of \"forms\" and \"contents\" with a transient relationship; form becoming content, and vice versa, dependent on the context. In this sense he was a forerunner to structuralist styles of reasoning in the social sciences. With his work on the metropolis, Simmel was a precursor of urban sociology, symbolic interactionism and social network analysis.\n\nAn acquaintance of Max Weber, Simmel wrote on the topic of personal character in a manner reminiscent of the sociological 'ideal type'. He broadly rejected academic standards, however, philosophically covering topics such as emotion and romantic love. Both Simmel and Weber's nonpositivist theory would inform the eclectic critical theory of the Frankfurt School.\n\nSimmel's most famous works today are \"The Problems of the Philosophy of History\" (1892), \"The Philosophy of Money\" (1900), \"The Metropolis and Mental Life\" (1903), \"Soziologie\" (1908, inc. \"The Stranger\", \"The Social Boundary\", \"The Sociology of the Senses\", \"The Sociology of Space\", and \"On The Spatial Projections of Social Forms\"), and \"Fundamental Questions of Sociology\" (1917). He also wrote extensively on the philosophy of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, as well on art, most notably his book \"Rembrandt: An Essay in the Philosophy of Art\" (1916).\n\nSimmel was born in Berlin, Germany, as the youngest of seven children of an assimilated Jewish family. His father, Eduard Simmel, a convert to Roman Catholicism, had founded a successful chocolate factory, Felix und Sarotti, later Sarotti Confections, and was a prosperous businessman. His mother came from a Jewish family who had converted to the Lutheran Church. Georg himself, was baptized as a Protestant when he was a child. \nHis father died in 1874, when Georg was 16, leaving a sizable inheritance. Georg was then adopted by Julius Friedländer, the founder of an international music publishing house, Peters Verlag, who endowed him with the large fortune that enabled him to become a scholar.\n\nBeginning in 1876, Simmel studied philosophy and history at the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1881, he received his doctorate for his thesis on Kant's philosophy of matter, \"Das Wesen der Materie nach Kants Physischer Monadologie\" (The Nature of Matter According to Kant's Physical Monadology).\n\nIn 1885, he became a \"Privatdozent\" at the University of Berlin, officially lecturing in philosophy but also in ethics, logic, pessimism, art, psychology and sociology. His lectures were not only popular inside the university, but attracted the intellectual elite of Berlin as well. Although his applications for vacant chairs at German universities were supported by Max Weber, Simmel remained an academic outsider. However, with the support of an inheritance from his guardian, he was able to pursue his scholarly interests for many years without needing a salaried position.\n\nSimmel had a hard time gaining acceptance in the academic community despite the support of well known associates, such as Max Weber, Rainer Maria Rilke, Stefan George and Edmund Husserl. Partly he was seen as a Jew during an era of anti-Semitism, but also simply because his articles were written for a general audience rather than academic sociologists. This led to dismissive judgements from other professionals. Simmel nevertheless continued his intellectual and academic work, as well as taking part in artistic circles.\n\nOnly in 1901, was he elevated to the rank of extraordinary professor (full professor, but without a chair; see the German section at Professor). At that time he was well known throughout Europe and America and was seen as a man of great eminence. \n\nIn 1909 Simmel, together with Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, and others, was a co-founder of the German Society for Sociology, serving as a member of its first executive body.\n\nIn 1914, Simmel received an ordinary professorship with chair, at the then German University of Strassburg, but did not feel at home there. Because World War I broke out, all academic activities and lectures were halted and lecture halls were converted to military hospitals. In 1915 he applied – without success – for a chair at the University of Heidelberg.\n\nPrior to World War I, Simmel had not been very interested in contemporary history, but rather in looking at the interactions, art and philosophy of his time. However, after its start, he was interested in its unfolding. Yet, he seems to give conflicting opinions of events, being a supporter in \"Germany's inner transformation\", more objective in \"the idea of Europe\" and a critic in \"The crisis of culture\". Eventually, Simmel grew tired of the war, especially in the year of his death.\n\nIn 1890, Georg married Gertrud Kinel, a philosopher who published under the pseudonym Marie-Luise Enckendorf, and under her own name. They lived a sheltered and bourgeois life, their home becoming a venue for cultivated gatherings in the tradition of the salon. They had one son, Hans Eugen Simmel, who became a medical doctor. Georg and Gertrud's granddaughter was the psychologist . Simmel also had a secret affair with his assistant Gertrud Kantorowicz, who bore him a daughter in 1907, though this fact was hidden until after Simmel's death. \n\nIn 1917, Simmel stopped reading the newspapers and withdrew to the Black Forest to finish his book. Shortly before the end of the war in 1918, he died from liver cancer in Strassburg.\n\nThere are four basic levels of concern in Simmel’s work. First are his assumptions about the psychological workings of social life. Second is his interest in the sociological workings of interpersonal relationships. Third is his work on the structure of and changes in the \"Zeitgeist\", the social and cultural “spirit” of his times. He also adopted the principle of emergence, which is the idea that higher levels emerge from the lower levels. Finally, he dealt with his views in the nature and inevitable fate of humanity. His most microscopic work dealt with forms and the interaction that takes place with different types of people. The forms include subordination, superordination, exchange, conflict and sociability.\n\nA dialectical approach is multicausal, multidirectional, integrates facts and value, rejects the idea that there are hard and fast dividing lines between social phenomena, focuses on social relations, looks not only at the present but also at the past and future, and is deeply concerned with both conflicts and contradictions. Simmel’s sociology was concerned with relationships—especially interaction—and was known as a “methodological relationist”. This approach is based on the idea that interactions exist between everything. Overall, he was mostly interested in dualisms, conflicts, and contradictions in whatever realm of the social world he happened to be working on.\n\nSimmel focused on forms of association and paid little attention to individual consciousness. Simmel believed in the creative consciousness and this belief can be found in diverse forms of interaction, the ability of actors to create social structures and the disastrous effects those structures had on the creativity of individuals. Simmel also believed that social and cultural structures come to have a life of their own.\n\nSimmel refers to \"all the forms of association by which a mere sum of separate individuals are made into a 'society,'\" which he describes as a, \"higher unity,\" composed of individuals. He was especially fascinated, it seems, by the, \"impulse to sociability in man\". He described it as \"associations...[through which] the solitariness of the individuals is resolved into togetherness, a union with others,\" a process he describes by which, \"the impulse to sociability distils, as it were, out of the realities of social life the pure essence of association,\" and \"through which a unity is made,\" which he also refers to as, \"the free-playing, interacting interdependence of individuals.\"\n\nHe defines sociability as, \"the play-form of association,\" driven by, \"amicability, breeding, cordiality and attractiveness of all kinds.\" In order for this free association to occur, he says, \"the personalities must not emphasize themselves too individually...with too much abandon and aggressiveness.\" He also describes, \"this world of sociability...a democracy of equals...without friction,\" so long as people blend together in a spirit of fun and affection to, \"bring about among themselves a pure interaction free of any disturbing material accent.\"\n\nSimmel describes idealized interactions when he says that, \"the vitality of real individuals, in their sensitivities and attractions, in the fullness of their impulses and convictions...is but a symbol of life, as it shows itself in the flow of a lightly amusing play,\" or when he adds: \"a symbolic play, in whose aesthetic charm all the finest and most highly sublimated dynamics of social existence and its riches are gathered.\"\n\nA dyad is a two-person group; a triad is a three-person group. In a dyad a person is able to retain their individuality. There is no other person to shift the balance of the group thereby allowing those within the dyad to maintain their individuality. In the triad group there is a possibility of a dyad forming within the triad thereby threatening the remaining individual's independence and causing them to become the subordinate of the group. This seems to be an essential part of society which becomes a structure. Unfortunately as the group (structure) becomes increasingly greater the individual becomes separated and grows more alone, isolated and segmented. Simmel's view was somewhat ambiguous with respect to group size. On one hand he believed that the bigger the group the better for the individual. In a larger group it would be harder to exert control on the individual, but on the other hand with a large group there is a possibility of the individual becoming distant and impersonal. Therefore, in an effort for the individual to cope with the larger group they must become a part of a smaller group such as the family.\n\nThe value of something is determined by the distance from its actor. In \"The Stranger\", Simmel discusses how if a person is too close to the actor they are not considered a stranger, but if they are too far they would no longer be a part of a group. The particular distance from a group allows a person to have objective relationships with different group members.\n\nOne of Simmel's most notable essays is \"The Metropolis and Mental Life\" (\"Die Großstädte und das Geistesleben\") from 1903, which was originally given as one of a series of lectures on all aspects of city life by experts in various fields, ranging from science and religion to art. The series was conducted alongside the Dresden cities exhibition of 1903. Simmel was originally asked to lecture on the role of intellectual (or scholarly) life in the big city, but he effectively reversed the topic in order to analyze the effects of the big city on the mind of the individual. As a result, when the lectures were published as essays in a book, to fill the gap, the series editor himself had to supply an essay on the original topic.\n\nThe \"Metropolis and Mental Life\" was not particularly well received during Simmel's lifetime. The organizers of the exhibition over-emphasized its negative comments about city life, because Simmel also pointed out positive transformations. During the 1920s the essay was influential on the thinking of Robert E. Park and other American sociologists at the University of Chicago who collectively became known as the \"Chicago School\". It gained wider circulation in the 1950s when it was translated into English and published as part of Kurt Wolff's edited collection, \"The Sociology of Georg Simmel\". It now appears regularly on the reading lists of courses in urban studies and architecture history. However, it is important to note that the notion of the blasé is actually not the central or final point of the essay, but is part of a description of a sequence of states in an irreversible transformation of the mind. In other words, Simmel does not quite say that the big city has an overall negative effect on the mind or the self, even as he suggests that it undergoes permanent changes. It is perhaps this ambiguity that gave the essay a lasting place in the discourse on the metropolis.\n\nIn this major work, Simmel saw money as a component of life which helped us understand the totality of life.\n\nSimmel believed people created value by making objects, then separating themselves from that object and then trying to overcome that distance. He found that things which were too close were not considered valuable and things which were too far for people to get were also not considered valuable. Considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting the object.\n\nFor Simmel, city life led to a division of labor and increased financialization. As financial transactions increase, some emphasis shifts to what the individual can do, instead of who the individual is. Financial matters in addition to emotions are in play.\n\nSimmel’s concept of distance comes into play where he identifies a stranger as a person that is far away and close at the same time.\nA stranger is far enough away that he is unknown but close enough that it is possible to get to know him. In a society there must be a stranger. If everyone is known then there is no person that is able to bring something new to everybody.\n\nThe stranger bears a certain objectivity that makes him a valuable member to the individual and society. People let down their inhibitions around him and confess openly without any fear. This is because there is a belief that the Stranger is not connected to anyone significant and therefore does not pose a threat to the confessor's life.\n\nMore generally, Simmel observes that because of their peculiar position in the group, strangers often carry out special tasks that the other members of the group are either incapable or unwilling to carry out. For example, especially in pre-modern societies, most strangers made a living from trade, which was often viewed as an unpleasant activity by \"native\" members of those societies. In some societies, they were also employed as arbitrators and judges, because they were expected to treat rival factions in society with an impartial attitude.\n\nOn one hand the stranger's opinion does not really matter because of his lack of connection to society, but on the other the stranger’s opinion does matter, because of his lack of connection to society. He holds a certain objectivity that allows him to be unbiased and decide freely without fear. He is simply able to see, think, and decide without being influenced by the opinion of others.\n\nAccording to Simmel, in small groups, secrets are less needed because everyone seems to be more similar. In larger groups secrets are needed as a result of their heterogeneity. In secret societies, groups are held together by the need to maintain the secret, a condition that also causes tension because the society relies on its sense of secrecy and exclusion.\nFor Simmel, secrecy exists even in relationships as intimate as marriage.In revealing all, marriage becomes dull and boring and loses all excitement. Simmel saw a general thread in the importance of secrets and the strategic use of ignorance: To be social beings who are able to cope successfully with their social environment, people need clearly defined realms of unknowns for themselves. Furthermore, sharing a common secret produces a strong \"we feeling.\" The modern world depends on honesty and therefore a lie can be considered more devastating than it ever has been before.\nMoney allows a level of secrecy that has never been attainable before, because money allows for “invisible” transactions, due to the fact that money is now an integral part of human values and beliefs. It is possible to buy silence.\n\nIn his multi-layered essay, published in 1923, Simmel discusses flirtation as a generalized type of social interaction. According to Simmel, \"to define flirtation as simply a 'passion for pleasing' is to confuse the means to an end with the desire for this end.\" The distinctiveness of the flirt lies in the fact that she awakens delight and desire by means of a unique antithesis and synthesis: through the alternation of accommodation and denial. In the behavior of the flirt, the man feels the proximity and interpenetration of the ability and inability to acquire something. This is in essence the \"price.\" A sidelong glance with the head half-turned is characteristic of flirtation in its most banal guise.\n\nIn the eyes of Simmel, fashion is a form of social relationship that allows those who wish to conform to the demands of a group to do so. It also allows some to be individualistic by deviating from the norm. There are many social roles in fashion and both objective culture and individual culture can have an influence on people. In the initial stage everyone adopts what is fashionable and those that deviate from the fashion inevitably adopt a whole new view of what they consider fashion. Ritzer wrote, \nThis means that those who are trying to be different or \"unique,\" are not, because in trying to be different they become a part of a new group that has labeled themselves different or \"unique\".\n\nSimmel´s major monographic works include, in chronological order:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

From 1988, Hannes has taught at the University of Iceland, becoming professor of political theory in the Faculty of Social Science in 1995. In 1984, he became a member of the Mont Pelerin Society, serving on its board of directors in 1998–2004. He was also a member of the board of the Central Bank of Iceland 2001–2009. He has been a Visiting Scholar at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, UCLA, George Mason University in Virginia, Tokyo University of the Fisheries, LUISS in Rome and International Centre for Economic Research, in Turin. He has twice been a Fulbright Scholar in the U. S. A. and once a Sasakawa Scholar in Japan. In 2005, Hannes organised a regional meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in Iceland, devoted to \"Freedom and Property in the 21st century\".\n\nHannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson was an assistant editor of \"Eimreiðin\", a magazine published in 1972–75 by a group of young classical liberals or libertarians in the Independence Party. The group included Davíð Oddsson, Þorsteinn Pálsson, Geir H. Haarde, Baldur Guðlaugsson, Brynjólfur Bjarnason, Kjartan Gunnarsson and Magnús Gunnarsson. The group became very influential within the Independence Party in the late 1970s and onwards, Þorsteinn Pálsson being party leader in 1983–91, Davíð Oddsson in 1991–2005 and Geir H. Haarde since 2005. The group is widely seen as having made the Independence Party much more libertarian than it used to be. Hannes is a personal friend of Davíð Oddsson and served as his informal adviser during his 13 years as Prime Minister of Iceland, 1991–2004 (after which Oddsson was Foreign Minister for one year, and then Governor of the Central Bank 2005–2009).\n\nIn 1979, Hannes and his friends founded the Libertarian Association in Iceland, which operated for ten years. It organized visits by the three Nobel Laureates Friedrich Hayek, James M. Buchanan and Milton Friedman in the early 1980s. Those visits had considerable impact on the exchange of ideas within Iceland. The Libertarian Association also published, in 1980–88, a magazine called \"Frelsið\". \n\nIn 1984, from October 2 to 10, Hannes, with Kjartan Gunnarsson, operated an illegal radio station, to protest against the government monopoly of broadcasting. Police eventually closed the station down. Hannes and Kjartan were indicted and fined for breaking the law on broadcasting. But the operation of the station and its closure turned many in the leadership of the Independence Party towards supporting the abolition of the government monopoly. The Icelandic parliament abolished the monopoly in 1985, and the law came into effect in 1986.\n\nIn early 1990, Hannes published a book on fisheries management, an important subject in Iceland whose main export is fish. It was entitled \"The Fish Stocks in the Icelandic Waters: The Property of the Nation or of the State?\" Hannes advocated a system of individual, transferable quotas, ITQs, in the Icelandic fisheries, where initially the quotas would be given free of charge to the owners of fishing vessels, in order to gain their support for what was tantamount to the enclosure of the Icelandic fishing grounds. The leadership of the Independence Party also supported the ITQ system. The Independence Party held the Ministry of Fisheries 1991–2009.\n\nIn 2002, Hannes published a book titled \"How Can Iceland Become the Richest Country in the World?\"suggesting that Iceland could become an international financial centre offering low corporate taxes and a stable political environment. He named, as precedents, Luxembourg and Ireland – two other small European countries— and small islands, such as the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans.\n\nThe corporate incomes tax in Iceland has already been lowered in the 1990s from 50% to 18%, and the net wealth tax had been abolished. The free-market reforms under the reign of the Independence Party 1991–2004 were comprehensive, not only consisting in tax reductions, but also in privatization, liberalization and stabilization. Enjoying access to the European financial market because of Iceland's membership of the EEA and also enjoying the high credit ratings for Icelandic companies earned in the 1991–2004 period, the Icelandic banks could expand rapidly, especially in the period after 2004. In the 2008 international financial crisis, the Icelandic Central Bank, since 2005 under the governorship of Davíð Oddsson, was refused credit lines from the US and Europe, with the result that the banks collapsed. It was argued that the Icelandic bank collapse was also a collapse of the neo-liberal model imposed on Iceland by Hannes and Davíð Oddsson. Hannes, however, points out that the Icelandic banks were subject to the same legal and regulatory framework as other banks in the EEA, and that their rapid credit expansion mostly took place after 2004.\n\nHannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson has from the beginning of his public career managed to stir up controversy. It began when he first had a weekly radio talk show, at the Public Broadcasting Station, in 1976-7, introducing his audience to writers like George Orwell, Arthur Koestler, Friedrich von Hayek, Ludwig von Mises and Karl Popper. The show was harshly criticized in the Socialist newspaper \"Þjóðviljinn\". In the early 1980s, Hannes and one of his former philosophy teachers at the University of Iceland, Þorsteinn Gylfason, had a public feud in the newspapers where Þorsteinn called Hannes \"a sheep in sheep's clothing\", and Hannes responded by praising Þorsteinn as one of the \"oldest and most promising philosophers in Iceland\".\n\nIn early 1984, Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson had a heated exchange with Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, then acting editor of the Socialist newspaper \"Þjóðviljinn\". Ólafur Ragnar had quoted articles in \"The Guardian\" in England to the effect that Milton Friedman, the \"guru of the Icelandic libertarians\", had, in his manipulation of his statistical data, acted dishonestly. The reference, by \"The Guardian\" and hence by Ólafur Ragnar, was to a recent critical study of Friedman's empirical research, by David Hendry, a professor of statistics at the University of Oxford. Hannes wrote to Hendry who replied, saying that he had never accused Friedman of any dishonesty, and that their disagreement was one on methodology. The publication of Hendry's letter ended the dispute in Iceland.\n\nWhen, in the summer of 1988, the Minister of Education, Mr. Birgir Isleifur Gunnarsson (a leading member of the Independence Party), appointed Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson assistant professor of politics in the Faculty of Social Science at the University of Iceland, the Faculty and the University protested, since they had strongly recommended another applicant for the job. A special committee appointed by the Faculty had argued that Hannes was only partly qualified for the position, since his first University degrees were not in politics, but in philosophy and history. But the Minister of Education presented written reports by Hannes' teachers in England, Dr John Gray, then of Jesus College, Oxford, later professor at the London School of Economics, and Professor Norman P. Barry of the University of Buckingham that Hannes was fully qualified for a job as a teacher of politics. Later, the Faculty of Social Science confirmed Hannes' appointments, first as an associate professor, then as professor.\n\nIn the 1990s, Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson was a vocal critic of an Icelandic businessman, Jón Ólafsson, chief owner of the private television channel, Stöð tvö. Jón Ólafsson was then seen by many as one of the bitterest enemies of Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson, Hannes' friend and ally. In a paper (originally in English) to a conference of journalists in Reykholt in the autumn of 1999, Hannes made disparaging remarks about Jón Ólafsson's past, which he subsequently put on his homepage (in English, as in the original). In 2004, on the basis of those remarks, Jón Ólafsson took Hannes to court in England, for libel, and obtained a judgement of £100,000. This was a judgement by default, as Hannes did not defend himself before the English court. Hannes appealed, arguing that a correct procedure had not been implemented against him, since he had not been served the claim form, or writ, according to Icelandic rules. The Royal High Court of Justice in London ruled in Hannes' favour and invalidated the decision against him on December 8, 2006. However, a ruling in March 2008 allowed the case to continue before English courts.\n\nHannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson informed the public, in the summer of 2003, that he was in the process of writing a three volumes' biography of Halldór Kiljan Laxness, the Icelandic Nobel Laureate in literature, and the leading Socialist intellectual in Iceland in the 20th century, When the first volume of Hannes' biography of Laxness was published in late 2003, Helga Kress wrote a long and critical review of it, arguing that Hannes was guilty of plagiarism since he had in his book drawn heavily on the accounts of Laxness' childhood in his four volumes of memoirs without proper attribution. In late 2004, Laxness' widow sued Hannes for an alleged breach of copyright. On November 10, 2006, Hannes was acquitted by the Reykjavík District Court. The Supreme Court did however find Hannes guilty of the copyright breach on March 13, 2008, and ordered him to pay substantial damages.\n\nIn 2013, Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson received a public apology from Robert Wade, Professor at the LSE, and Sigurbjörg Sigurgeirsdóttir, a colleague of Hannes at the University of Iceland, for them having wrongly attributed to him as a direct quotation, from the Wall Street Journal in 2004, words that he had never written.\n\n\n"}

The Honor System is intended to be student administered.\n\nIt was founded by Virginia students in 1842 after John A. G. Davis, chairman of the faculty and professor of law, who was attempting to resolve a conflict between students, was shot to death. The University had at that point a 17-year history of ongoing tensions between students and faculty over strictly enforced discipline, hours, and dress. Students, sons of the most prominent families of Virginia, found particularly galling the impugning of their honor by stringent supervision during tests: \"[t]he students were allowed to bring only a pencil to the classroom, they were forbidden to speak, and the professors, operating in shifts, watched them with 'lynx-like' eyes during the course of the examinations.\" Law professor Henry St. George Tucker, Sr., proposed a basic honor pledge as an alternative to faculty oversight.\n\nOriginally the honor system only applied to allegations of cheating, although it was subsequently expanded to hold students to a general standard of gentlemanly conduct: the shared values of an all white, all male Southern aristocratic tradition. In modern times, however, the Honor System is composed of only three simple tenets: a student will not lie, cheat, or steal. It extends to matters academic and personal, and the sole sanction for a confirmed Honor System violation is dismissal from the university. This is called the \"single sanction system\".\nThe system is not without its detractors—it has been criticized because the required severe penalty may prevent more moderate violations from being reported or acted upon. Although students have voted on numerous proposals to weaken or eliminate the single sanction over the past few decades, none has ever succeeded. Support for the honor system has waned in recent years, and in the Spring of 2007 a non-binding referendum to replace the single sanction with a tiered, multiple sanction system received 49.5% of the votes cast, falling just 62 votes shy of a majority.\n\nWhile cheating convictions are relatively rare (24 students were dismissed during the 2003 academic year, and 21 more were dismissed in 2004), a large cheating scandal occurred in 2001. Physics professor and Hereford College Dean Louis Bloomfield, based on a student's complaint, suspected that some of his students copied portions of their term papers from fraternity archives in his Introduction to Physics class. After devising a computer program to detect copied phrases of at least six sequential words, over 150 students were accused of plagiarizing or allowing others to plagiarize their work over the previous five semesters. Although over 100 of these students were eventually exonerated, 48 students either admitted guilt or were convicted, and were therefore dismissed from the university. Three of these students had already graduated, and their degrees were subsequently revoked.\n\nLawsuits have challenged the honor system, such as a 1983 case brought by an expelled law student that reached the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Courts so far have concluded the system affords due process sufficient to satisfy constitutional expectations.\n\nHowever, there has been at least one case of UVA administration interference in an honor proceeding under the threat of a lawsuit. In 1993 an Honor Trial convicted Christopher Leggett of cheating. The Honor Committee of that year insisted Leggett had received a fair trial but President John Casteen called it flawed, after Leggett's family hired law firm Williams & Connolly. The President and Board of Visitors forced the Executive Committee of the Honor Committee to grant a new trial (not provided for in the Honor bylaws) and in the second trial the student jury acquitted Leggett. One Honor Committee member resigned because of the administration's interference.\n"}

As of March 2018, the journal is led by an interim editor, Ann Garry, and two interim co-editors, Serene Khader and Alison Stone. Book reviews are published by \"Hypatia Reviews Online (HRO)\". The journal is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia, Inc.\n\nThe idea for the journal arose out of meetings of the Society for Women in Philosophy (SWIP) in the 1970s. Philosopher and legal scholar Azizah Y. al-Hibri became the founding editor in 1982, when it was published as a \"piggy back\" issue of the \"Women's Studies International Forum\". Named after Hypatia of Alexandria, a philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE, it became an independent journal in 1986.\n\n\"Hypatia\" became involved in a damaging dispute in April 2017 when its associate editors published an unauthorized apology for the journal's publication of an article on transracialism, after the author and article were criticized on social media. The episode pointed to a significant breakdown of communications within \"Hypatia\"s editorial team. The journal responded by setting up a task force to restructure its governance. \"Hypatia\" was the subject of further controversy in 2018, when it accepted a hoax article that had been deliberately designed to satirise feminist philosophy. The hoax, which formed part of the Grievance studies scandal, was revealed before the article could be published. \n\n\"Hypatia\" has its roots in regional meetings of the Society for Women in Philosophy (SWIP), established in 1972. One of SWIP's earliest ideas was that it would set up a philosophy journal. The thought of \"a journal of our own\" was very powerful, according to Kathryn Morgan (Toronto), speaking in 2009 on the history of \"Hypatia\". At the time, according to Linda Martín Alcoff (CUNY), president of the Hypatia Inc. board of directors since February 2018, philosophers who wanted to write about gender-related issues were being silenced in a discipline \"riven by unabashed bias and vested interest, inflicting its own form of unapologetic mob violence\". \nSWIP decided in 1977 to set up an editorial board to plan the journal; the first board was put together by Ann Garry (Cal State LA) and Jacqueline Thomason (UMass Amherst). At a meeting in Denver in the spring of 1979, the board agreed that Azizah Y. al-Hibri (UR) should be the founding editor. Al-Hibri began work on the journal in 1982, after she had completed her PhD in philosophy and just as she was starting her first year of law school. The philosophy and women's studies departments at the University of Pennsylvania offered support in the form of an office and research assistance. \"Women's Studies International Forum\" agreed to publish the new journal as an annual \"piggy back\" issue of its own, which it did for three years, and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising it.\n\nThe group led by Al-Hibri decided that submissions would be fully reviewed and that substantive comments would be offered, Alcoff wrote, rather than the usual brief rejection, to help authors improve their work and to contribute to the field's development. Donna Serniak (Penn) was responsible for the first issue. It was first published independently of \"Women's Studies International Forum\" in 1986.\n\nThe journal is named after Hypatia of Alexandria, a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have \"deep roots in philosophy\". According to Linda López McAlister (USF), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson (Barnard) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. Sandra Harding (UCLA), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been \"stoned to death for telling the truth\". The first suggestion was \"Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism\", rather than \"A Journal of Feminist Philosophy\", because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.\n\n\"Hypatia\" is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia, Inc., registered in April 2008 in the State of Washington. The purpose of the non-profit is \"to foster feminist scholarship in philosophy and related fields, including through the publication of the academic journal \"Hypatia\"\". As of 18 February 2018, the board of directors consists of Linda Martín Alcoff (CUNY), Talia Mae Bettcher (Cal State LA), Helen Longino (Stanford), Jacqueline Scott (Loyola), and Nancy Tuana (Penn State). Ann Garry (Cal State LA) serves \"ex officio\" as the editorial-team representative. There is also an advisory board, an editorial board, and a governance task force.\n\nEditors-in-chief usually serve five-year terms. As of March 2018, the journal is led by an interim editor, Ann Garry, and two interim co-editors, Serene Khader (Brooklyn College/CUNY) and Alison Stone (Lancaster). The interim editors of \"Hypatia Reviews Online\" are Simon Ruchti and Joan Woolfrey (both WCUPA). Previous editors-in-chief were:\n\n\"Hypatia\" has an international readership. According to the publisher, 48 percent of its 373,011 full-text downloads went to subscribers outside North America in 2016. Around 10,500 unique visitors were registered every month by Wiley-Blackwell's \"Hypatia\" website as of that year. Around the world, 4,048 libraries provided access to the journal through subscriptions, and another 6,943 in the developing world were able to access it at little or no cost.\n\n\"Hypatia\" became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the online shaming of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, an untenured assistant professor of philosophy at Rhodes College in Memphis. The episode pointed to a breakdown of communications within \"Hypatia\"s editorial team, and to a rift within feminism and academic philosophy.\n\nThe journal had published Tuvel's article, \"In Defense of Transracialism\", in its spring 2017 edition after the standard double-anonymous peer review. Comparing the case of Caitlyn Jenner to that of Rachel Dolezal, Tuvel argued that \"[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races.\" On 28 April the article was criticized on Facebook and Twitter, and Tuvel became the target of personal attacks. The following day an open letter, listing a member of \"Hypatia\"s editorial board as its point of contact, urged that the article be retracted; by 2 May this had gathered 830 signatures. The journal distanced itself further from the article on 1 May when an \"Hypatia\" associate editor apologized on the journal's Facebook page for the article's publication, on behalf of \"a majority of the Hypatia's Board of Associated Editors\". The editor-in-chief, Sally Scholz (Villanova), stood by the article, and the board of directors, led by Miriam Solomon (Temple), confirmed that it would not be retracted.\n\nIn July 2017 Scholz resigned as editor-in-chief, along with Shelley Wilcox, editor of \"Hypatia Reviews Online\". The board of directors announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone in an editorial or non-board position with \"Hypatia\" would be \"required to sign a statement of adherence to guidelines issued by COPE, the Committee on Publication Ethics\". According to a statement from the associate editors, whose role was to choose the next editor, the board of directors asked them, on 17 July, to resign or the journal's governance documents would be suspended, which would remove the associate editors' influence. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In their resignation statement, they wrote that the current controversy was \"grounded in long-standing differences and tensions within the field.\" They argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into \"a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people.\"\n\nThe board appointed interim editors, and in November 2017 Sally Haslanger (MIT), Serene Khader, and Yannik Thiem (Villanova) were named as the governance task-force co-chairs. The five-person board of directors, including Solomon, was replaced in February 2018. Linda Martín Alcoff and Kim Hall, two of the associate editors who resigned in July, became president of the board of directors and chair of the search committee for the new editorial team, respectively.\n\n\"Hypatia\" is abstracted and indexed in the following bibliographic databases:\nAccording to the \"Journal Citation Reports\", the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 0.712.\n\n\n"}

Gherea (Francized \"J. D. Ghéréa\"; 1895 – November 5, 1978), was a Romanian philosopher, essayist, and concert pianist. The son of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, a Marxist theoretician and critic, and the brother of communist militant Alexandru \"Sașa\" Gherea, he discarded their political and literary influence, being more interested in the aestheticism of his brother-in-law, Paul Zarifopol. As a youth, Zarifopol took him to meet playwright Ion Luca Caragiale and his family. Gherea's debut as a writer was a 1920 novel written jointly with Luca Caragiale, which was also his only contribution to the genre.\n\nEnjoying national success as an accompanist for George Enescu, Gherea was also a respected literary essayist, and a noted Romanian phenomenologist, ontologist, and philosopher of art; his lasting friendship with philosopher Constantin Noica transcended ethnic and ideological barriers. An anti-authoritarian, Gherea was repressed by during the first decade of Romanian communism, but reemerged in the 1960s as a memoirist and Nietzsche translator.\n\nBorn into a Jewish family in Ploiești, he was the third child of Marxist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and his wife Sofia (\"née\" Parcevska, or \"Parcevskaia\"). The family originated in Yekaterinoslav, a Ukrainian part of the Russian Empire: patriarch Gherea fled to Romania to escape persecution for his political activism, and worked menial jobs before getting his break in journalism. At Iași, he married Sofia; she was the daughter of a Polish gourmet chef, who was also Gherea's business associate. Around the time of Ionel's birth, his father, mother, and his grown-up siblings were managing the Ploiești Train Station Restaurant, a venue for commercial and literary transactions, but also a hangout for Romanian and exile Russian Marxists, including Leon Trotsky and Pavel Axelrod. Alexandru soon made an impact as a revolutionary socialist, and later communist, militant.\n\nGherea's early education took place at home and was followed by the local Saints Peter and Paul High School, where he graduated from the sciences section. Together with his elder sister Ștefania and her husband, literary critic Paul Zarifopol, he lived in Germany for a time, especially in Leipzig, and in Italy, but returned home upon the outbreak of World War I. In his father's houses in Ploiești and Sinaia, as well as in Germany, he became acquainted with Caragiale; Gherea became friends with the playwright's younger son Luca (Luki). Other cultural figures whom he met in the family homes include Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, Alexandru Vlahuță, George Coșbuc, Panait Cerna and Sextil Pușcariu. His memoirs include sharply drawn portraits as well as revealing anecdotes about Caragiale and his elder son, Mateiu.\n\nAround 1915, young Gherea was a student at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, where he became close friends with poet Artur Enășescu and met Tudor Vianu, his fellow critic. He was also close to Lucia Demetrius, and, together with Zarifopol, helped her launch her career as a novelist. Together with Luki, Gherea himself wrote the novel \"Nevinovățiile viclene\" (\"The Cunning Naïvetés\"). A study in adolescent psychology, which has earned posthumous appreciation, it appeared in \"Viața Românească\" in 1920. The work shocked conservative sensibilities with its supposed libertinage, and was only taken up by the literary magazine following Zarifopol's intercession.\n\nWith Luki dying the next year, Gherea never returned to fiction writing. He dedicated himself to philosophy and criticism, with essays which appeared in \"Revue Philosophique\", \"Viața Românească\" and its satellite, \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", \"Kalende\", later in Zarifopol's \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\" and \"Revista de Filosofie\". Such works reveal his intellectual debt to Blaise Pascal; a generous use of irony; complex readings from Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, but also of Marcel Proust, Paul Valéry, Francis Jammes, and Knut Hamsun. His abstract, philosophically grounded speculations somewhat resemble Zarifopol's, but unlike his onetime mentor, he often wrote down impressionist thoughts in the manner of Anatole France, one of his favorite authors, glossing over the discrepancies and limitations of the texts he discussed. He is especially known for his pioneering study on Proust's snobbery, which appeared in the 1929 edition of \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", and in which he opposed Zarifopol's own Proustianism.\n\nGherea was also friends with violinist-composer George Enescu: in 1927 or 1928, he accompanied Enescu as a pianist on a domestic concert tour, also leaving anecdotes from that encounter. The two reunited in 1936, when Enescu returned to the country and included Gherea on his team of touring pianists, which also included Dinu Lipatti, Alfred Alessandrescu, and Muza Ghermani Ciomac. Gherea claimed that, overall, he had been Enescu's piano accompanist in as many as 300 separate performances.\n\nDuring those years, Gherea was writing a lengthy treatise on the philosophy of self; titled \"Le Moi el le monde. Essai d'une cosmogonie anthropomorphique\" (\"The Self and the World. An Essay in Anthropomorphic Cosmogony\"), it initially appeared in 1933 in the Paris-based \"Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale\". It was published in book form in Paris and in Bucharest in 1938. The book was noted by reviewer Constantin Floru for its disregard toward academic terminology, basing itself on \"common sense\", \"years-long meditation\", and \"the erudition of a subtle spirit\". It earned Gherea the friendship and admiration of academic philosophers Constantin Noica and Petru Comarnescu, who prepared the book for Editura Fundațiilor Regale. Noica referred to Gherea as an \"innovative\" asset in Romanian philosophy, comparing him to Stéphane Lupasco and Pius Servien.\n\n\"Le Moi el le monde\" mapped out an independent phenomenology and ontology, imagining situations in which the \"coexistence\" of individual minds creates an implicit need for time perception, which inevitably leads them to the noumenon—hence, \"cosmogony is anthropomorphic\". As read by Floru, Gherea understood these selves as monadic units, with direct reference to Leibnitz's ontological essences. Gherea's \"anthropomorphism\" was nevertheless a critique of \"naive\" materialism, seeking to rehabilitate idealism with input from particle physics. Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, himself a historical materialist, found the work to be \"original\", but remained critical of Gherea's implicit agnosticism and explicit consequentialism.\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Gherea and Noica were involved with the \"Criterion\" cultural forum. He was supposed to lecture there about the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, but, being a timid man, lost his composure; he was filled in by Mircea Vulcănescu, who reused his notes. He and Noica became friends, despite the latter being a right-leaning national conservative. Noica wrote in 1936: \"One of the several things about [Gherea] that left a mark on me is that, although he lives in a leftist milieu and carries a surname dear to the Jewish and socialist circles, he has never once profited from this and has been living in want, at least not these past few years.\"\n\nThe rise of Iron Guard fascism and antisemitism was a disappointment for Gherea, a fact documented by Mihail Sebastian, a Zarifopol disciple and fellow Jewish writer. However, with Vulcănescu and Noica, he remained one of the \"young philosophers and disciples\" who stood by metaphysician and Guard affiliate Nae Ionescu, when the latter was released from a concentration camp for political prisoners. In December 1940, the Iron Guard's National Legionary government ordered his father's remains to be exhumed and reburied in a Jewish-only cemetery.\n\nAfter World War II and the fall of fascism, Gherea, whose brother had taken refuge to the Soviet Union and killed as a dissident during the Great Purge, was troubled by the prospects of communization. In a 1946 interview with Ion Biberi, he expressed his support for a \"tolerant and libertarian democracy\", but believed that the future belonged to \"the sort of socialism that prevents people from speaking their mind.\" Gherea's final decades were lived under the communist regime. Branded a \"decadent\" philosopher in the Marxist works of Constantin Ionescu Gulian, he was marginalized together with other thinkers of his generation. By 1955, his father, Constantin, was being officially recovered as a precursor of socialist realism, the standard literary dogma, but his works appeared only in censored form. Gherea was mainly focused on translation work, putting out versions of Jammes, Thomas de Quincey and Heinrich Mann into Romanian, while rendering Ion Marin Sadoveanu's \"Sfârșit de veac în București\" into French.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Gherea's continued visits with Noica became a subject of interest for Securitate agents, who were monitoring Noica for his former Iron Guard affiliation. Noica and many of his friends were arrested and tried in 1960, with Gherea himself interrogated. Later that decade, the regime introduced controlled liberalization, and Gulian was sidelined. \"Nevinovățiile viclene\" came out in a paperback edition at Editura Tineretului, 1969. Gherea's work became more available. His essays reprinted in \"Manuscriptum\", then as the 1971 \"Eseuri\" (\"Essays\"), Gherea's 1938 study was only fully published in Romanian in 1984, as \"Eul și lumea\".\n\nLiving his final years in Bucharest, Gherea was sought after by his father's Hungarian Romanian biographer and translator, Gyula Csehi, their interviews published in \"Igaz Szó\" on Gherea's 70th birthday. Csehi left this portrait of Gherea Jr: \"His face is surprisingly like his fathers'. He is a quiet, gentle, thoughtful man, mindful of all exaggeration.\" Returning to philosophical work, in 1978 Gherea and Ion Herdan also published a translation from Nietzsche's \"Birth of Tragedy\", also signaling a recovery for the German thinker.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "369040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369040", "title": "Is–ought problem", "text": "Is–ought problem\n\nThe is–ought problem, as articulated by the Scottish philosopher and historian David Hume (1711–76), states that many writers make claims about what \"ought\" to be, based on statements about what \"is\". Hume found that there seems to be a significant difference between positive statements (about what is) and prescriptive or normative statements (about what ought to be), and that it is not obvious how one can coherently move from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones. The is–ought problem is also known as Hume's law, Hume's guillotine or fact–value gap.\n\nA similar view is defended by G. E. Moore's open-question argument, intended to refute any identification of moral properties with natural properties. This so-called naturalistic fallacy stands in contrast to the views of ethical naturalists.\n\nHume discusses the problem in book III, part I, section I of his book, \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1739):\n\nHume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly \"can\" an \"ought\" be derived from an \"is\"? The question, prompted by Hume's small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible. This complete severing of \"is\" from \"ought\" has been given the graphic designation of \"Hume's Guillotine\".\n\nThe apparent gap between \"is\" statements and \"ought\" statements, when combined with Hume's fork, renders \"ought\" statements of dubious validity. Hume's fork is the idea that all items of knowledge are based either on logic and definitions, or else on observation. If the is–ought problem holds, then \"ought\" statements do not seem to be known in either of these two ways, and it would seem that there can be no moral knowledge. Moral skepticism and non-cognitivism work with such conclusions.\n\nEthical naturalists contend that moral truths exist, and that their truth value relates to facts about physical reality. Many modern naturalistic philosophers see no impenetrable barrier in deriving \"ought\" from \"is\", believing it can be done whenever we analyze goal-directed behavior. They suggest that a statement of the form \"In order for agent \"A\" to achieve goal \"B\", \"A\" reasonably ought to do \"C\"\" exhibits no category error and may be factually verified or refuted. \"Oughts\" exist, then, in light of the existence of goals. A counterargument to this response is that it merely pushes back the 'ought' to the subjectively valued 'goal' and thus provides no fundamentally objective basis to one's goals which, consequentially, provides no basis of distinguishing moral value of fundamentally different goals. A possible basis for an objective, moral realist, morality might be an appeal to teleonomy.\n\nThis is similar to work done by moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, who attempts to show that because ethical language developed in the West in the context of a belief in a human telos—an end or goal—our inherited moral language, including terms such as good and bad, have functioned, and function, to evaluate the way in which certain behaviors facilitate the achievement of that telos. In an evaluative capacity, therefore, good and bad carry moral weight without committing a category error. For instance, a pair of scissors that cannot easily cut through paper can legitimately be called bad since it cannot fulfill its purpose effectively. Likewise, if a person is understood as having a particular purpose, then behaviour can be evaluated as good or bad in reference to that purpose. In plainer words, a person is acting good when that person fulfills that person's purpose.\n\nEven if the concept of an \"ought\" is meaningful, this need not involve morality. This is because some goals may be morally neutral, or (if they exist) against what is moral. A poisoner might realize his victim has not died and say, for example, \"I ought to have used more poison,\" since his goal is to murder. The next challenge of a moral realist is thus to explain what is meant by a \"\"moral\" ought\".\n\nProponents of discourse ethics argue that the very act of discourse implies certain \"oughts\", that is, certain presuppositions that are necessarily accepted by the participants in discourse, and can be used to further derive prescriptive statements. They therefore argue that it is incoherent to argumentatively advance an ethical position on the basis of the is–ought problem, which contradicts these implied assumptions.\n\nAs MacIntyre explained, someone may be called a good person if people have an inherent purpose. Many ethical systems appeal to such a purpose. This is true of some forms of moral realism, which states that something can be wrong, even if every thinking person \"believes\" otherwise (the idea of brute fact about morality). The ethical realist might suggest that humans were created for a purpose (e.g. to serve God), especially if they are an ethical non-naturalist. If the ethical realist is instead an ethical naturalist, they may start with the fact that humans have evolved and pursue some sort of evolutionary ethics (which risks “committing” the moralistic fallacy).\nNot all moral systems appeal to a human telos or purpose. This is because it is not obvious that people even \"have\" any sort of natural purpose, or what that purpose would be. Although many scientists do recognize teleonomy (a tendency in nature), few philosophers appeal to it (this time, to avoid the naturalistic fallacy).\nGoal-dependent oughts run into problems even without an appeal to an innate human purpose. Consider cases where one has no desire to be good—whatever it is. If, for instance, a person wants to be good, and good means washing one's hands, then it seems one morally ought to wash their hands. The bigger problem in moral philosophy is what happens if someone does \"not\" want to be good, whatever its origins? Put simply, in what sense \"ought\" we to hold the goal of being good? It seems one can ask \"how am I rationally required to hold 'good' as a value, or to pursue it?\"\n\nThe issue above mentioned is a result of an important ethical relativist critique. Even if \"oughts\" depend on goals, the ought seems to vary with the person's goal. This is the conclusion of the ethical subjectivist, who says a person can only be called good according to whether they fulfill their own, \"self-assigned\" goal. Alasdair MacIntyre himself suggests that a person's purpose comes from their culture, making him a sort of ethical relativist. Ethical relativists acknowledge local, institutional facts about what is right, but these are facts that can still vary by society. Thus, without an objective \"moral goal\", a moral ought is difficult to establish. G. E. M. Anscombe was particularly critical of the word \"ought\" for this reason; understood as \"We need such and such, and the only way to get it is this way\"—a person may need something immoral, or else find that their noble need requires immoral action.\n\nIf moral goals depend on private assumptions or public agreement, so may morality as a whole. For example, Canada might call it good to maximize global welfare, where a citizen, Alice, calls it good to focus on herself, and then her family, and finally her friends (with little empathy for strangers). It does not seem that Alice can be objectively or rationally bound—without regard to her personal values \"nor\" those of groups of other people—to act a certain way. In other words, we may not be able to say \"You just \"should\" do this\". Moreover, persuading her to help strangers would necessarily mean appealing to values she already possesses (or else we would never even have a hope of persuading her). This is another interest of normative ethics—questions of binding forces.\n\nThere may be responses to the above relativistic critiques. As mentioned above, ethical realists that are non-natural can appeal to God's purpose for humankind. On the other hand, naturalistic thinkers may posit that valuing people's well-being is somehow 'obviously' the purpose of ethics, or else the only relevant purpose worth talking about. This is the move made by natural law, scientific moralists and some utilitarians.\n\nJohn Searle also attempts to derive \"ought\" from \"is\". He tries to show that the act of making a promise places one under an obligation by definition, and that such an obligation amounts to an \"ought\". This view is still widely debated, and to answer criticisms, Searle has further developed the concept of institutional facts, for example, that a certain building \"is\" in fact a bank and that certain paper \"is\" in fact money, which would seem to depend upon general recognition of those institutions and their value.\n\nIndefinables are concepts so global that they cannot be defined; rather, in a sense, they themselves, and the objects to which they refer, define our reality and our ideas. Their meanings cannot be stated in a true definition, but their meanings can be referred to instead by being placed with their incomplete definitions in self-evident statements, the truth of which can be tested by whether or not it is impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction. Thus, the truth of indefinable concepts and propositions using them is entirely a matter of logic.\n\nAn example of the above is that of the concepts \"finite parts\" and \"wholes\"; they cannot be defined without reference to each other and thus with some amount of circularity, but we can make the self-evident statement that \"the whole is greater than any of its parts\", and thus establish a meaning particular to the two concepts.\n\nThese two notions being granted, it can be said that statements of \"ought\" are measured by their \"prescriptive\" truth, just as statements of \"is\" are measured by their \"descriptive\" truth; and the descriptive truth of an \"is\" judgment is defined by its correspondence to reality (actual or in the mind), while the prescriptive truth of an \"ought\" judgment is defined according to a more limited scope—its correspondence to right desire (conceivable in the mind and able to be found in the rational appetite, but not in the more \"actual\" reality of things independent of the mind or rational appetite).\n\nTo some, this may immediately suggest the question: \"How can we know what is a right desire if it is already admitted that it is not based on the more actual reality of things independent of the mind?\" The beginning of the answer is found when we consider that the concepts \"good\", \"bad\", \"right\" and \"wrong\" are indefinables. Thus, right desire cannot be defined properly, but a way to refer to its meaning \"may\" be found through a self-evident prescriptive truth.\n\nThat self-evident truth which the moral cognitivist claims to exist upon which all other prescriptive truths are ultimately based is: \"One ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else.\" The terms \"real good\" and \"right desire\" cannot be defined apart from each other, and thus their definitions would contain some degree of circularity, but the stated self-evident truth indicates a meaning particular to the ideas sought to be understood, and it is (the moral cognitivist might claim) impossible to think the opposite without a contradiction. Thus combined with other descriptive truths of what is good (goods in particular considered in terms of whether they suit a particular end and the limits to the possession of such particular goods being compatible with the general end of the possession of the total of all real goods throughout a whole life), a valid body of knowledge of right desire is generated.\n\nSeveral counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an \"ought\" logically follows from an \"is.\" First of all, Hilary Putnam, by tracing back the quarrel to Hume's dictum, claims fact/value entanglement as an objection, since the distinction between them entails a value. A. N. Prior points out, from the statement \"He is a sea captain,\" it logically follows, \"He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do.\" Alasdair MacIntyre points out, from the statement \"This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably,\" the evaluative conclusion validly follows, \"This is a bad watch.\" John Searle points out, from the statement \"Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars,\" it logically follows that \"Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars.\" The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.\n\nPhilippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a \"committal in a new dimension.\" She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word \"injury.\" Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?\n\nFoot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.\nHilary Putnam argues philosophers that accept Hume's \"is–ought\" distinction reject his reasons in making this, and thus undermine the entire claim.\n\nVarious scholars have also indicated that, in the very work where Hume argues for the is–ought problem, Hume himself derives an \"ought\" from an \"is\". Such seeming inconsistencies in Hume have led to an ongoing debate over whether Hume actually held to the is–ought problem in the first place, or whether he meant that ought inferences can be made but only with good argumentation.\n\n\n"}

Gordon (born 1947) is a biologist and the Dr. Robert J. Glaser Distinguished University Professor and Director of the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. He is internationally known for his research on gastrointestinal development and how gut microbial communities affect normal intestinal function, shape various aspects of human physiology including our nutritional status, and affect predisposition to diseases. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.\n\nGordon received his bachelor's degree in Biology at 1969 at Oberlin College in Ohio. Over the next four years, Gordon received his medical training at the University of Chicago and graduated with honors in 1973. After two years as intern and junior assistant resident in Medicine at Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Gordon joined the Laboratory of Biochemistry at the National Cancer Institute as a Research Associate in 1975. He returned to Barnes Hospital in 1978 to become Senior Assistant Resident and then Chief Medical Resident at Washington University Medical Service. In 1981 he completed a fellowship in medicine (Gastroenterology) at Washington University School of Medicine. In the following years, Gordon rose quickly through the academic ranks at Washington University: Asst. Prof. (1981–1984); Assoc. Prof. (1985–1987); Prof. (1987–1991) of Medicine and Biological Chemistry. In 1991, he became head of the Dept. Molecular Biology & Pharmacology (1991–2004). Gordon is currently the Director of the Center for Genome Sciences (2004–present) at Washington University.\n\nGordon’s early career focused on the development of cell lineages within the gastrointestinal tract. His laboratory initially combined the use of transgenic mouse models and biochemical approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of gut epithelial development along the duodenal-colonic and crypt-villus axes. Early studies also provided important insight into biochemical properties of lipid handling and transport in the digestive system. Dr. Gordon and colleagues later combined laser capture microdissection, and functional genomics to characterize specified cell populations within the gastrointestinal tract, including multipotent stem cells.\n\nGordon played a pivotal role in the study of protein N-myristoylation, a co-translational modification by which a myristoyl group is covalently attached to an N-terminal glycine residue of a nascent polypeptide. Gordon and his colleagues were instrumental in characterizing the mechanism by which N-myristoyltransferase (the enzyme that catalyzes the myristoylation reaction) selects its substrates and its catalytic mechanism.\n\nGordon’s group published a series of elegant studies that describe the ability of components of the commensal microbiota to induce specific responses in the host intestinal epithelium. One of these responses, the induction of intestinal cell surface fucose residues, is elicited by a prominent human intestinal symbiont,\" Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron\", which can harvest and use the host fucose as a carbon and energy source. Gordon’s group published a seminal study in which functional genomics were used to document the genome-wide intestinal epithelial response to microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Dr. Gordon’s laboratory has investigated epithelial cell interaction with human-associated pathogens, including uropathogenic \"Escherichia coli\", \"Helicobacter pylori\", and \"Listeria monocytogenes\".\n\nDr. Gordon and his laboratory are currently focused on understanding the mutualistic interactions that occur between humans and the 10-100 trillion commensal microbes that colonize each person’s gastrointestinal tract. To tease apart the complex relationships that exist within this gut micobiota, Dr. Gordon’s research program employs germ-free and gnotobiotic mice as model hosts, which may be colonized with defined, simplified microbial communities. These model intestinal microbiotas are more amenable to well-controlled experimentation.\n\nJeffrey Gordon has become an international pioneer in the study of gut microbial ecology and evolution, using innovative methods to interpret metagenomic and gut microbial genomic sequencing data. In recent studies, Dr. Gordon’s lab has established that the gut microbiota plays a role in host fat storage and obesity. Gordon and co-workers have used DNA pyrosequencing technology to perform metagenomics on the intestinal contents of obese mice, demonstrating that the gut microbiota of fat mice possess an enhanced capacity for aiding the host in harvesting energy from the diet. A study of the microbial ecology of obese human subjects on two different weight loss diets indicate that the same principles may be operating in humans. His group has applied the sequencing of bacterial and archaeal genomes to describe the microbial functional genomic and metabolomic underpinnings of microbial adaptation to the gastrointestinal habitat. This approach has been extended to describe the role of the adaptive immune system in maintaining the host-microbial relationship.\n\nDr. Gordon is the lead author of an influential 2005 National Human Genome Research Institute white-paper entitled “Extending Our View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)”. In 2007 the Human Microbiome Project was listed on the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research as one of the New Pathways to Discovery.\n\n\n"}

Jandun is best known for his outspoken defense of Aristotelianism and his influence in the early Latin Averroist movement.\n\nJandun was born in Reims, in the Champagne region of France, between 1280 and 1289, though the exact date is unknown. It is likely that he grew up in the small town of Jandun (modern day Signy-l'Abbaye).\n\nJandun is known to have become a member of the arts faculty in Paris by 1310, likely by as early as 1307. While a professor in Paris, Jandun was well informed and involved with theological debates. In 1315 Jandun became an original member of the faculty at the College of Navarre and was in charge of 29 students. In 1316 Pope John XXII awarded Jandun a canonry of Senlis, and it is likely that he spent time there, though he continued to teach in Paris for the next ten years.\n\nJandun identified closely with Marsilius of Padua, another Latin Averroist who was rector at the university in Paris from 1312-1313. Marsilius presented Jandun with a copy of Pietro d'Abano's commentary on the problems of Aristotle.\n\nOn 19 June 1324 Jandun was involved in a business transaction to rent a house for life. Four days later Marsilius finished the \"Defensor Pacis\". When it became known in 1326 that Marsilius had authored the \"Defensor Pacis\", he and Jandun fled together to the court of Louis IV of Bavaria. Pope John XXII began issuing condemnations against Jandun from 6 September 1326 and finally excommunicated Jandun on 23 October 1327 as a heretic.\n\nJandun accompanied Louis IV to Italy, and was present in Rome on 1 May 1328 when Louis IV was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Louis appointed Jandun as Bishop of Ferrara. Ten weeks later Jandun was formally accepted as a member of Louis IV's court, and was given indefinite rations for three servants and three horses. Later that summer, around 31 August 1328, Jandun died in Todi, most likely en route to his new bishopric.\n\nJandun is best known for his work on the \"agens sensus\", the principle of individuation, and the priority of universal knowledge to particular knowledge. He also wrote on the theory of the vacuum, plurality of forms, form and matter, the soul, the intellect, as well as other topics relating to Aristotle. Because of his closeness to Marsilius of Padua, Jandun is often incorrectly credited with authoring or coauthoring the \"Defensor pacis\". It is now generally accepted that he did not write it, but it is possible that Jandun advised Marsilius on the work.().\n\nJandun's works first appeared in manuscript beginning with a short \"quaestio\"in 1314, though he may have begun writing as early as 1310 or 1307. He is also the author of an encomnium to Paris (\"Tractatus de laudibus parisius\"), written in 1323, which gives a description of that city in the fourteenth century. Printed editions of his works include:\n\n\nJandun's work carried the Latin Averroist tradition from Paris to Bologna, Padua, and Erfurt in the fourteenth century, and Krakow in the fifteenth century. Jandun tended toward the views of Aristotle, but was not afraid to follow an idea to its logical conclusion. Many of his views were uncommon and controversial, and were not received well by the Catholic Church. Manuscripts and printed editions influenced the Latin Averroist movement until the time of Galileo.\n\n"}

Laplace himself did not use the word \"demon\", which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: \"Une intelligence... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir, comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux.\" Apparently, Laplace was not the first to evoke one such demon and strikingly similar passages can be found decades before Laplace's \"Essai philosophique\" in the work of scholars such as Nicolas de Condorcet and Baron D'Holbach. However, it seems that the first who offered the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence was Roger Joseph Boscovich, whose formulation of the principle of determinism in his 1758 \"Theoria philosophiae naturalis\" turns out not only to be temporally prior to Laplace's but also—being founded on fewer metaphysical principles and more rooted in and elaborated by physical assumptions—to be more precise, complete and comprehensive than Laplace's somewhat parenthetical statement of the doctrine.\n\nAccording to chemical engineer Robert Ulanowicz, in his 1986 book \"Growth and Development\", Laplace's demon met its end with early 19th century developments of the concepts of irreversibility, entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics. In other words, Laplace's demon was based on the premise of reversibility and classical mechanics; however, Ulanowicz points out that many thermodynamic processes are irreversible, so that if thermodynamic quantities are taken to be purely physical then no such demon is possible as one could not reconstruct past positions and momenta from the current state. Maximum entropy thermodynamics takes a very different view, considering thermodynamic variables to have a statistical basis which can be kept separate from the microscopic physics. However, this theory has met criticism regarding its ability to make predictions about physics; a number of physicists and mathematicians, including Yvan Velenik of the Department of Mathematics for the University of Geneva, have pointed out that maximum entropy thermodynamics essentially describes our knowledge about a system and not the system itself.\n\nDue to its canonical assumption of determinism, Laplace's demon is incompatible with the Copenhagen interpretation, which stipulates indeterminacy. The interpretation of quantum mechanics is still very much open for debate and there are many who take opposing views (such as the Many Worlds Interpretation and the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation).\n\nChaos theory is sometimes pointed out as a contradiction to Laplace's demon: it describes how a deterministic system can nonetheless exhibit behavior that is impossible to predict: as in the butterfly effect, minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences. While this explains unpredictability in practical cases, applying it to Laplace's case is questionable: under the strict demon hypothesis all details are known—to infinite precision—and therefore variations in starting conditions are non-existent. Put another way: Chaos theory is applicable when knowledge of the system is imperfect whereas Laplace's demon assumes perfect knowledge of the system, therefore chaos theory and Laplace's demon are actually compatible with each other.\n\nIn 2008, David Wolpert used Cantor diagonalization to disprove Laplace's demon. He did this by assuming that the demon is a computational device and showed that no two such devices can completely predict each other.. Wolpert's paper was cited in 2014 in a paper of Josef Rukavicka, where a significantly simpler argument is presented that disproves Laplace's demon using Turing machines. \n\nThere has recently been proposed a limit on the computational power of the universe, i.e. the ability of Laplace's demon to process an infinite amount of information. The limit is based on the maximum entropy of the universe, the speed of light, and the minimum amount of time taken to move information across the Planck length, and the figure was shown to be about 10 bits. Accordingly, anything that requires more than this amount of data cannot be computed in the amount of time that has elapsed so far in the universe.\n\nAnother theory suggests that if Laplace's demon were to occupy a parallel universe or alternate dimension from which it could determine the implied data and do the necessary calculations on an alternate and greater time line, the aforementioned time limitation would not apply. This position is for instance explained in \"The Fabric of Reality\" by David Deutsch, who says that realizing a 300-qubit quantum computer would prove the existence of parallel universes carrying the computation.\n\nCounter arguments to this can be made using string theory. Albeit, the gradients of finite theories are useful, speculative scenarios, such as space-time decompactification occurring on a faster frame, require infinities whose interpretation remains open.\n\nIn the anime series \"\", Laplace's Demon is the basis of a high school student's computer program called Dark Star. Dark Star is a program which allows for a masked vigilante, Twenty Faces, to cause the deaths of people who have escaped justice.\n\nIn \"Blast of Tempest\", chaos theory and the butterfly effect are incorporated into the main theme, where time travel and breaking out of parallel universes become the main plot.\n\nIn the film \"Waking Life\" a discussion of Laplace's Demon takes place, as well as a handling of the retort from Quantum Mechanics.\n\nIn the webcomic \"Dresden Codak\", this concept is used in a page melding philosophical notions and a \"Dungeons and Dragons\" séance titled \"Advanced dungeons and discourse\". In this page, Kimiko Ross has to burn the second law of thermodynamics in order to summon the demon.\n\nThe UK sitcom \"Spaced\" featured an episode called Chaos, in which the artist Brian makes an implicit reference to Laplace's Demon in a conversation about chaos theory. He states that reality is a mathematically predictable preordained system, even though it would \"utterly defy any possibility of comprehension by even the most brilliant human mind.\"\n\nIn the light novel and anime series \"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\", it is mentioned in order to try define the situation in which the main protagonist is repeating a specific day.\n\n\"Rapurasu no Majo\" (\"Laplace's Witch\"), a 2015 novel by Japanese author Keigo Higashino.

{"id": "739262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=739262", "title": "Neural correlate", "text": "Neural correlate\n\nA neural correlate of a content of experience is any bodily component, such as an electro-neuro-biological state or the state assumed by some biophysical subsystem of the brain, whose presence necessarily and regularly correlates with such a specific content of experience.\n\nWhen the full ontological consistence or build-up of the reality variably called mind, soul, psyche, or existentiality is called \"consciousness\" and deemed to exclusively consist in mental contents associated with and at least partly generated by the brain organ, the notion of neural correlate of consciousness is commonly employed. When it is only the sensations that are held to be produced by brain states, whether exclusively or not (\"e.g.\", when sensations are also deemed capable of being generated by the mind reacting against itself), then the notion of neural correlate of a content of experience is commonly utilized. A mid-way concept, not always clarified, is that of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content but not of consciousness itself.\n\nThe notion of a neural correlate of a mental state is an important concept for materialists, those philosophers of mind and researchers who believe that all mental states are equivalent to brain states. According to strict materialists, all properties credited to the mind, including consciousness, emotion, beliefs, and desires have direct neural correlates. This is also a pragmatic view adopted by a number of scholars. This view frequently depends on considering minds exclusively as sentient knots in nature's causal net.\n\nInstead, other neuroscientists find minds inaugurating causal actions in nature, rather than solely being able of merely continuing previously initiated causal sequences. These neuroscientists thus describe minds as percipient agencies, the mind's very agency or causal aptitude being deemed extraneous to any neural correlate.\n\nStill, some neurobiologists consider reasons to further assume that rememberings are not engraved in brain tissue but retained by the very mind, which thereby transforms itself in a way different from the time changes underwent by non-minds. These later neuroscientists consider that there is no neural correlate for episodal and some other memories, but that the mind moves the brain state (like as it may also inaugurate a finger movement) in such a way as to produce a brain state which the mind then reacts to by fleshing its selected memory again (Husserl's \"Einfüllung\"), re-imagining it. This view develops a notion by Aristotle and, again, makes no use of the notion of neural correlate for certain experiences, namely in regard to complex mental contents. It only admits neural correlates for the mind's elementary sensational reactions, which are called \"intonations\" (following neurobiologist Christfried Jakob, 1866-1956).\n\nThe concept of a neural correlate only encompassing the production of intonations occurs in a variety of researchers on different neurobiological traditions, including Scholasticism (see \"References\"). Rather, the concept of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content occurs only in a specific conceptual line of theoretical neuroscience, characterized by the following features:\n\n\nIn the conceptual line characterized by these four features, and in recent years, papers have been published on the neural correlates of awareness, emotions, and decision making. Francis Crick wrote a popular book \"The Astonishing Hypothesis\" whose thesis is that the neural correlate for consciousness lies in our nerve cells and their associated molecules. Crick and his collaborator Christof Koch have sought to avoid philosophical debates that are associated with the study of consciousness, by emphasizing the search for \"correlation\" and not \"causation\".\n\nThere is much room for disagreement about the nature of this correlation (\"e.g.\", does it require synchronous spikes of neurons in different regions of the brain? Is the co-activation of frontal or parietal areas necessary?). The philosopher David Chalmers maintains that a neural correlate of consciousness, unlike other correlates such as for memory, will fail to offer a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.\n\nNeurophysiological studies in animals provided some insights on the neural correlates of conscious behavior. Vernon Mountcastle, in the early 1960s, set up to study this set of problems, which he termed \"the Mind/Brain problem\", by studying the neural basis of perception in the somatic sensory system. His labs at Johns Hopkins were among the first, along with Edward V.Evarts at NIH, to record neural activity from behaving monkeys. Struck with the elegance of SS Stevens approach of magnitude estimation, Mountcastle's group discovered three different modalities of somatic sensation shared one cognitive attribute: in all cases the firing rate of peripheral neurons was linearly related to the strength of the percept elicited. More recently, Ken H. Britten, William T. Newsome, and C. Daniel Salzman have shown that in area MT of monkeys, neurons respond with variability that suggests they are the basis of decision making about direction of motion. They first showed that neuronal rates are predictive of decisions using signal detection theory, and then that stimulation of these neurons could predictably bias the decision. Such studies were followed by Ranulfo Romo in the somatic sensory system, to confirm, using a different percept and brain area, that a small number of neurons in one brain area underlie perceptual decisions.\n\nOther lab groups have followed Mountcastle's seminal work relating cognitive variables to neuronal activity with more complex cognitive tasks. Although monkeys cannot talk about their perceptions, behavioral tasks have been created in which animals made nonverbal reports, for example by producing hand movements. Many of these studies employ perceptual illusions as a way to dissociate sensations (\"i.e.\", the sensory information that the brain receives) from perceptions (\"i.e.\", how the consciousness interprets them). Neuronal patterns that represent perceptions rather than merely sensory input are interpreted as reflecting the neuronal correlate of consciousness.\n\nUsing such design, Nikos Logothetis and colleagues discovered perception-reflecting neurons in the temporal lobe. They created an experimental situation in which conflicting images were presented to different eyes (\"i.e.\", binocular rivalry). Under such conditions, human subjects report bistable percepts: they perceive alternatively one or the other image. Logothetis and colleagues trained the monkeys to report with their arm movements which image they perceived. Temporal lobe neurons in Logothetis experiments often reflected what the monkeys' perceived. Neurons with such properties were less frequently observed in the primary visual cortex that corresponds to relatively early stages of visual processing. Another set of experiments using binocular rivalry in humans showed that certain layers of the cortex can be excluded as candidates of the neural correlate of consciousness. Logothetis and colleagues switched the images between eyes during the percept of one of the images. Surprisingly the percept stayed stable. This means that the conscious percept stayed stable and at the same time the primary input to layer 4, which is the input layer, in the visual cortex changed. Therefore layer 4 can not be a part of the neural correlate of consciousness. Mikhail Lebedev and their colleagues observed a similar phenomenon in monkey prefrontal cortex. In their experiments monkeys reported the perceived direction of visual stimulus movement (which could be an illusion) by making eye movements. Some prefrontal cortex neurons represented actual and some represented perceived displacements of the stimulus. Observation of perception related neurons in prefrontal cortex is consistent with the theory of Christof Koch and Francis Crick who postulated that neural correlate of consciousness resides in prefrontal cortex. Proponents of distributed neuronal processing may likely dispute the view that consciousness has a precise localization in the brain.\n\nIn addition to neural correlate of consciousness in general, much progress has been made in elucidating neural correlates of specific cognitive variables. Thus, Earl Miller and colleagues discovered prefrontal cortex neurons that represent perceptual categories (cats versus dogs in their experiments). The work of Richard Andersen, Steven Wise, Carl Olson, Jun Tanji, Apostolos Georgopoulos and other neuroscientists has illuminated neuronal correlates of motor planning, selective visual attention, motor sequences and spatial reference frames in which these entities are represented by brain cells. The progress in understanding neuronal correlates of motor planning has led to the creation of brain-machine interface so, the devices that translate neuronal activity into purposeful commands to artificial actuators.\n\nA large number of studies have addressed the problem of neural correlates of mental representations in human subjects. For example, functional neuroimaging have shown that parts of the cortex are still active in vegetative patients that are presumed to be unconscious (Laureys, Trends Cogn Sci, 2005, 9:556-559). However, these areas appear to be functionally disconnected from associative cortical areas whose activity is needed for awareness.\n\n\n"}

Its modern advocates press upon achieving success following the principles of Yoga, and stepping beyond personal goals and agendas while pursuing any action over greater good, which has become well known since it is the central message of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nIn Indian philosophy, action or Karma has been divided into three categories, according to their intrinsic qualities or gunas. Here Nishkam Karma belongs to the first category, the \"Sattva\" (pure) or actions which add to calmness; the Sakam Karma (Self-centred action) comes in the second \"rājasika\" (aggression) and Vikarma (bad-action) comes under the third, \"tāmasika\" which correlates to darkness or inertia.\n\nThe opposite of \"Sakam Karma\" (Attached Involvement) or actions done with results in mind, Nishkam Karma has been variously explained as 'Duty for duty's sake' and as 'Detached Involvement', which is neither negative attitude or indifference; and has today found many advocates in the modern business area where the emphasis has shifted to ethical business practices adhering to intrinsic human values and reducing stress at the workplace.\n\nAnother aspect that differentiates it from Sakam or selfish action, is that while the former is guided by inspiration, the latter is all about motivation, and that makes the central difference in its results, for example Sakam Karma might lead to excessive work pressure and workaholism as it aims at success, and hence creates more chances of physical and psychological burn outs. On the other hand Nishkam Karma, means more balanced approach to work, and as work has been turned into a pursuit of personal excellence, which results in greater personal satisfaction, which one would have otherwise sought in job satisfaction coming from external rewards. One important fallout of the entire shift is that where one is essentially an ethical practice inside-out leading to the adage, ‘Work is worship’ show itself literally at workplace, leading to greater work commitment, the other since it is so much result oriented can lead to unethical business and professional ethics, as seen so often at modern work place \n\nSince the central tenet of practicing Nishkam Karma is Mindfulness in the present moment. Over time, this practice leads to not only equanimity of mind as it allows the practitioner to stay detached from results, and hence from ups and downs of business that are inevitable in any business arena, while maintaining constant work commitment since work as now been turned into a personal act of worship. Further in the long run it leads to cleansing of the heart but also spiritual growth and holistic development.\n\nNishkam Karma, gets an important place in the \"Bhagavad Gita\", the central text of Mahabharata, where Krishna advocates 'Nishkam Karma Yoga' (the Yoga of Selfless Action) as the ideal path to realize the Truth. Allocated work done without expectations, motives, or thinking about its outcomes tends to purify one's mind and gradually makes an individual fit to see the value of reason and the benefits of renouncing the work itself. These concepts are vividly described in the following verses:\n\n\n"}

It asserts that experience includes both particulars and relations between those particulars, and that therefore both deserve a place in our explanations. In concrete terms: any philosophical worldview is flawed if it stops at the physical level and fails to explain how meaning, values and intentionality can arise from that.\n\nRadical empiricism is a postulate, a statement of fact and a conclusion, says James in \"The Meaning of Truth\". The postulate is that \"the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from experience\". The fact is that our experience contains disconnected entities as well as various types of connections, it is full of meaning and values. The conclusion is that our worldview does not need \"extraneous trans-empirical connective support, but possesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous structure.\"\n\nThe postulate is a basic statement of the empiricist method: our theories shouldn't incorporate supernatural or transempirical entities. Empiricism is a theory of knowledge that emphasizes the role of experience, especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, while discounting \"a priori\" reasoning, intuition, or revelation. James allows that transempirical entities may exist, but that it's not fruitful to talk about them.\n\nJames' factual statement is that our experience isn't just a stream of data, but a complex process that's full of meaning. We see objects in terms of what they mean to us and we see causal connections between phenomena. Experience is \"double-barreled\": it has both a content (\"sense data\") and a reference, and empiricists unjustly try to reduce experience to bare sensations, according to James. Such a \"thick\" description of conscious experience was already part of William James' monumental work \"The Principles of Psychology\" in 1890, more than a decade before he first wrote about radical empiricism.\n\nIt differs notably from the traditional empiricist view of Locke and Hume, who see experience in terms of atoms like patches of color and soundwaves, which are in themselves meaningless and need to be interpreted by ratiocination before we can act upon them.\n\nJames concludes that experience is full of connections and that these connections are part of what is actually experienced:\nJames put forth the doctrine because he thought ordinary empiricism, inspired by the advances in physical science, has or had the tendency to emphasize 'whirling particles' at the expense of the bigger picture: connections, causality, meaning. Both elements, James claims, are equally present in experience and both need to be accounted for.\n\nThe observation that our adherence to science seems to put us in a quandary is not exclusive to James. For example, Bertrand Russell notes the paradox in his \"Analysis of Matter\" (1927): we appeal to ordinary perception to arrive at our physical theories, yet those same theories seem to undermine that everyday perception, which is rich in meaning.\n\nRadical empiricism relates to discussions about direct versus indirect realism as well as to early twentieth-century discussions against the idealism of influential philosophers like Josiah Royce. This is how neo-realists like William Pepperell Montague and Ralph Barton Perry interpreted James.\n\nThe conclusion that our worldview does not need transempirical support is also important in discussions about the adequacy of naturalistic descriptions of meaning and intentionality, which James attempts to provide, in contrast to phenomenological approaches or some forms of reductionism that claim that meaning is an illusion.\n\n"}

Arkoun's book has been cited in a number of scholarly sources for providing a contemporary understanding of the development of Islamic philosophy and its effects in the Muslim world.\n\n\"Rethinking Islam\" discusses a range of topics including the various ways in which Islamic ideas have been interpreted over time and the perspective of developments in Islamic countries from their own point of view. A \"New York Times\" review called the book \"an illustration of the contemporary fecundity of Islam\" and called Arkoun \"the leading French-language spokesman calling for a rethinking of Islam in a modern mode.\"\n\nIn his work, Arkoun writes on the subject of thought and meaning. He declared there are three categories of thought. He labels these categories as 'thinkable', 'unthinkable' and 'unthought'. Arkoun taught that meaning is generated by semantic creativity, the inventiveness of a subject especially while under the pressure of new and unfamiliar existential demands that necessitate destroying, transforming, or surpassing previous meanings.\n\nArkoun was of the view that Islamic thought had always included a discourse on the rights of God (either public or collective rights) and the rights of man (essentially individual rights), with the former having priority over the latter.\n\nIn \"Rethinking Islam\", Arkoun argues for a concise understanding Islamic development in modern times and attempts to deconstruct the popular western misrepresentations. He argues: \"Islamic culture, in fact, is not reducible to the stereotypes articulated by the Christian religion and European cultures ever since the thirteenth century.\" Arkoun argues that \"Mediterranean thinking\" is always multiple and open, always engaged in exchange, negotiation, and dialogue between \"influences and residues\".\n\nAccording to Arkoun, public discussion of secular aspects embedded within a religious understanding of the universal concept of human rights was not the prime factor bringing Islamic countries in recent years to a \"compromise position\". Arkoun suggested that scholars studying the intellectual development of Islam today need to see beyond the imposed restrictions in many Middle Eastern countries on various kinds of knowledge in journalism, political studies and deviant Islamist ideologies.\n\nArkoun admits that many fundamental changes occur in the constant interpretation of Islamic texts. He states that it is especially true of the Qur'an, which \"has been ripped from its historical, linguistic, literary, and psychological contexts and then been continually recontextualized in various cultures and according to the ideological needs of various actors.\"\n\nFundamentalist and politically inspired Islamic movements tend to reaffirm in their own theological discourse by casting their ideology in an orientalist imaging of Islam.\n\n"}

It is derived from the Latin \"nihil\", meaning \"nothing\". After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881, the Nihilists were known throughout Europe as proponents of the use of violence in order to bring about political change.\n\nRussian nihilism (rus. \"нигилизм\") can be divided into two periods. The foundational period (1860-1869) where the 'counter-cultural' aspects of nihilism scandalized Russia, and even the smallest of indiscretions resulted in nihilists being sent to Siberia or imprisoned for lengthy periods of time, and where the philosophy of nihilism was formed. There followed the revolutionary period of Nihilism (1870-1881) when Sergei Nechayev's pamphlet \"The Catechism of a Revolutionist\" transformed the movement, which was waiting and only striking mild propaganda, into a movement-with-teeth and a will to wage war against the tsarist regime, with dozens of actions against the Russian state. The revolutionary period ends with the assassination of the Tsar Alexander II (March 13, 1881), and the consequential crushing of the nihilist movement.\n\nMikhail Bakunin's (1814-1876) \"Reaction in Germany\" (1842) included a famous dictum, \"Let us therefore trust the eternal Spirit which destroys and annihilates only because it is the unfathomable and eternal source of all life. The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!\" This piece of literature anticipated and instigated the ideas of the nihilists. In Russia, Bakunin was considered a Westernizer because of his influences that spread the ideology of anarchism outside of his nation to the rest of Europe and Russia. While he is inexorably linked to both the foundational and revolutionary periods of nihilism, Bakunin was a product of the earlier generation whose vision, ultimately, was not the same as the nihilist view. He stated this best as \"I am a free man only so far as I recognize the humanity and liberty of all men around me. In respecting their humanity, I respect my own.\" This general humanitarian instinct is in contrast to the nihilist proclamations of having a \"hate with a great and holy hatred\" or calling for the \"annihilation of aesthetics\". \nNikolay Chernyshevsky was the first to incorporate nihilism in the socialist agenda. The nihilist contribution to socialism in general was the concept that the peasant was an agent of social change (Chernyshevsky, A Criticism of Philosophical Prejudices Against the Obshchina (1858)), and not just the bourgeois reformers of the revolutions of 1848, or the proletariat of Marx (a concept that wouldn't reach Russia until later). Agitation for this position landed Chernyshevsky in prison and exile in Siberia for the next 25 years (although the specific accusations with which he was convicted were a concoction) in 1864. The first group inspired by nihilist ideas to form and work towards social change did so as a secret society, and were called Land and Liberty. This group's name was also taken by another, entirely separate group, during the Revolutionary Nihilist period, with the first Land and Freedom conspiring to support the Polish independence movement and to agitate the peasants who were burdened with debt as a result of the crippling redemption payments required by the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. Polish independence was not of particular interest to the nihilists, and after a plot to incite Kazan peasants to revolt failed, Land and Liberty folded (1863).\n\nAfter the failure, the Russian government began to actively hunt nihilist revolutionaries, so the first secret nihilist societies were created. One of the first to act in secrecy was called The Organization, and they created a boys' school in a Moscow slum in order to train revolutionaries. In addition they had a secret sub-group called Hell whose purpose was political terrorism, with the assassination of the Tsar as their ultimate goal. This resulted in the failed attempt by Dmitry Karakozov on the 4th of April 1866. Dmitry was tried and hanged at Smolensk Field in St Petersburg. The leader of The Organization, Nicholas Ishutin, was also tried and was to be executed before being exiled to Siberia for life. Thus ended The Organization.\n\nThe White Terror began by the Tsar putting Count Mikhail Muravyov (1845-1900) (otherwise known as 'Hanger Muravyov' due to his treatment of Polish rebels in prior years) in charge of the suppression of the nihilists. The two leading radical journals (\"The Contemporary\" and \"Russian Word\") were banned, liberal reforms were minimized in fear of reaction from the public, and the educational system was reformed to stifle the existing revolutionary spirit. This action by the Russian state marks the end of the foundational period of nihilism.\n\nThe entrance on the scene of Sergey Nechayev symbolizes the transformation from the foundational period to the revolutionary period. Nechayev, the son of a serf, which was unusual as most nihilists came from a slightly higher social class, what we would call lower middle class, desired an escalation of the discourse on social transformation. Nechayev argued that just as the European monarchies used the ideas of Machiavelli, and the Catholic Jesuits practiced absolute immorality to achieve their ends, there was no action that could not be also used for the sake of the people's revolution. A scholar noted that \"His apparent immorality [more an amorality] derived from the cold realization that both Church and State are ruthlessly immoral in their pursuit of total control. The struggle against such powers must therefore be carried out by any means necessary.\" Nechayev's social cache was greatly increased by his association with Bakunin in 1869 and extraction of funds from the Bakhmetiev Fund for Russian revolutionary propaganda.\n\nThe image of Nechayev is as much a result of his \"Catechism of a Revolutionist\" (1869) as any actions he actually took. The Catechism is an important document as it establishes the clear break between the formation of nihilism as a political philosophy and what it becomes as a practice of revolutionary action. It documents the revolutionary as a much transformed figure from the nihilist of the past decade. Whereas the nihilist may have practiced asceticism, they argued for an uninhibited hedonism. Nechayev assessed that the Revolutionary, by definition, must live devoted to one aim and not allow themselves to be distracted by emotions or attachments. Friendship was contingent on revolutionary fervor, relationships with strangers were quantified in terms of what resources they offered revolution, and everyone had a role during the revolutionary moment that boiled down to how soon they would be lined up against the wall or when they would accept that they had to do the shooting. The uncompromising tone and content of the Catechism was influential far beyond the mere character Nechayev personified in the minds of the revolutionaries. Part of the reason for this is the way in which it extended nihilist principles into a revolutionary program. The rest of the reason was that the catechism gave the revolutionary project a form of constitution and weight that the \"men of the sixties\" did not.\n\nBakunin, an admirer of Nechayev's zeal and stories of his organization's success, provided contacts and resources to send Nechayev back to Russia as his representative of the Russian Section of the World Revolutionary Alliance, which was also an imaginary organization. Upon his return to Russia, Nechayev formed the secret, cell based organization, People's Vengeance. One student member of the organization Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov questioned the very existence of the Secret Revolutionary Committee that Nechayev claimed to be the representative of. This suspicion of Nechayev's modus operandi required action. Author Ronald Hingley, wrote \"On the evening of 21 November 1869 the victim [Ivanov] was accordingly lured to the premises of the Moscow School of Agriculture, a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment, where Nechayev killed him by shooting and strangulation, assisted without great enthusiasm by three dupes… Nechayev's accomplices were arrested and tried.\" Upon his return from Russia to Switzerland, Nechayev was rejected by Bakunin, for his taking of militant actions, and was eventually extradited back to Russia where he spent the remainder of his life at the Peter and Paul Fortress. He did, due to his charisma and force of will, continue to influence events, maintaining a relationship to People's Will and weaving even his jailers into his plots. He was found dead in his cell in 1882.\n\n\n"}

After finishing the secondary school with honors in 1968, he studied at the Department of Physics of The Azerbaijan State University (now Baku State University - BSU) and graduated with honors from BSU in 1973. In the same year he was admitted to the Aspirantura (graduate school) in Philosophy.\n\nHe defended his PhD (Kandidat nauk) thesis titled “Systematic Structural Analysis of Scientific and Technological Progress” in 1976. After completing his postdoctoral research he successfully defended a thesis titled “Logico-gnoseological issues of Scientific and Technological Progress” in 1989. In the same year he became a professor and the head of the Philosophy Department at Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University. He founded the University “Azerbaijan” — the first private university in Azerbaijan in 1991 and was its rector up to 2006. Since 1994 he has been leading the Research Center “East and West”. Prof. S. Khalilov established the international socio-political journal “Ipek Yolu” (The Silk Road) in 1997 and was its Editor-in-Chief up to 2005. In 2002 he was elected as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Azerbaijan Association of Philosophy and Socio-Political Sciences (AFSEA). From 2003 he is the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal “Felsefe ve Sosial-siyasi Elmler” (Philosophy and Socio-Political Sciences). Since 2006 he is a Member of the Presidium of the Higher Attestation Commission under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In 2007 Prof. Khalilov was elected as the Corresponding-Member of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences. From 2009 he is the Chairman of Scientific Council of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan on Philosophy, Political and Social Sciences.\n\nProf. Khalilov’s investigations are mainly focused on Philosophy of Science, Science about Science, Philosophical Comparativism, Phenomenology, Philosophical Aspects of Eastern and Western Civilizations, Philosophy of Abu Turkhan, Cognitive Theory.\n\nS.Khalilov founded and was the first leader of the Junior Physicists School in Azerbaijan in 1972.\nHe was elected as the Chairman of Young Scientists at Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University in 1981 and further in 1988 he was elected as the Chairman of Young Humanity Scientists of Azerbaijan. From 1997 he is the Chairman of Prize Committee named after Bahmaniar (award given for works on philosophy in Azerbaijan)\n\nProf. S.Khalilov was the Member of the Parliament of Azerbaijan and Deputy-Chairman of the “Science and Education” Permanent Commission of the Parliament during 2000-2005 ().\n\n\nResearches of Prof. Salahaddin Khalilov elucidate the stages of the process of application of new scientific knowledge to production with logical-gnoseological way; they also determine the special place and specificities of scientific-technical knowledge in the classification of sciences, and draw comparative analysis of the notions of “applied sciences”, “technical sciences”, “scientific-technical knowledge”, “technological knowledge”. The comparative researches of science and economy, science and technology, science and language, science and religion, science and education, science and literature etc., are useful to appraise the role of science in the modern social life from different aspects. Some of his investigations are dealing with determination of the peculiarities of Eastern and Islamic way of thought.\nProf. Khalilov discusses ideas which are presented in the West as intuition, irrational comprehension and mysticism in the context of Tasavvuf philosophy. His researches compare several Islamic philosophers with Western philosophers, such as comparison between Avicenna and Descartes, Suhravardi and Kant, Ibn Khaldun and Karl Marx and also give an explanation of similarities between Sufizm and Phenomenology.\nIn his opinion the problem of determining the boundary between conscious and unconscious is in some sense equivalent to the problem of isolating the rational soul in the structure of internal life. From what does consciousness originate? The core condition for consciousness is the obviousness of an object. This is achieved by the concretion of a certain idea in the confines of the body. (For every object, reality is the synthesis of an infinite number of ideas.) Intentionality, phenomenological reduction, is the isolation of a single idea in pure form. Alongside Brentano’s and Husserl’s notably efficient idea about the intentionality of consciousness, other ideas and constructions of Husserl directed at the creation of an all-embracing theory seem to be argumentative and are sometimes also artificially constructed. For instance, there is the problem of the corporeal activity of man, the idea of kinetic consciousness, etc. where the functions of the body are seen as if detached from the functioning of the sensory organs.\nIn his papers he discusses some peculiarities – simililarities and differences – of memory and remembrance (personal life memory). The mechanisms of storing knowledge and recollection have been analysed. It was shown that earlier used spirit-body or soul-body methods could not adequately explain the correlation between memory and remembrance . For consideration specific details of the correlation of memory and remembrance more realistic model of “spirit-soul-body” or “mind-soul-body” was developed.\nSome of Western ideologists have considered that Eastern Islamic countries, including Azerbaijan, stay behind Western countries in the economical competition based on modern technology, for the reasons of Islam and traditional thought. However, sciences which are bases of economical development do not depend on the religions of scientists. S. Khalilov explains that it could be a problem of relations of religion and science but not of religions of scientists. When we define the main attributes of the East and West, it becomes clear that all religions, including the Christianity are Eastern phenomena, regardless of their geographical location. So, it would be wrong if we relate Western civilization to the Christianity.\nAccording to the view of Prof. Khalilov, the modern civilization had been formulated by joint efforts of both the East and the West, in different stages of history.\n\n\n"}

She directed the UCLA Center for the Study of Women from 1996 to 2000, and co-edited \"\" from 2000 to 2005. She is currently a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education and Gender Studies at UCLA and a Distinguished Affiliate Professor of Philosophy at Michigan State University. In 2013 she was awarded the John Desmond Bernal Prize by the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S). (Earlier recipients of this prize include Robert Merton, Thomas S. Kuhn, Mary Douglas, and Joseph Needham.)\n\nShe has developed the research standard of “strong objectivity,” and contributed to the articulation of standpoint methodology. This kind of research process starts off from questions that arise in the daily lives of people in oppressed groups. To answer such questions, it “studies up”, examining the principles, practices and cultures of dominant institutions, from the design and management of which oppressed groups have been excluded. She has also contributed to the development of feminist, anti-racist, multicultural, and postcolonial studies of the natural and social sciences, asking the extent to which paradigms like feminist empiricism are useful for promoting to goals of feminist inquiry. She is the author or editor of many books and essays on these topics, and was one of the founders of the fields of feminist epistemology and philosophy of science. This work has been influential in the social sciences and in women/gender studies across the disciplines. It has helped to create new kinds of discussions about how best to relink scientific research to pro-democratic goals.\n\nShe has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Amsterdam, the University of Costa Rica, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and the Asian Institute of Technology. She has been a consult to several United Nations organizations including the Pan American Health Organization, UNESCO, the U.N. Commission on Science and Technology for Development, and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. Phi Beta Kappa selected her as a national lecturer in 2007. She has lectured at over 300 colleges, universities, and conferences, on five continents.\n\nDuring what is known now as the \"Science Wars\", she was part of a debate regarding the value-neutrality of the sciences. This aspect of her work has been criticized by the mathematicians Michael Sullivan, Mary Gray, and Lenore Blum, and by the historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz.\n\nHarding referred to Newton's \"Principia Mathematica\" as a \"rape manual\" in her 1986 book \"The Science Question in Feminism\", a characterization that she later said she regretted.\n\nSandra Harding received her undergraduate degree from Douglass College of Rutgers University in 1956. After 12 years working as legal researcher, editor, and fifth-grade math teacher in New York City and Poughkeepsie, N.Y., she returned to graduate school and earned a doctorate from the Department of Philosophy at New York University in 1973.\n\nHer first university teaching job was at The Allen Center of the State University of New York at Albany, an experimental critical social sciences college which was “defunded” by the state of New York in 1976. She then joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Delaware, with a joint appointment to the Women’s Studies Program. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1979, and to full Professor in 1986. From 1981 until she left Delaware in 1996, she held a Joint Appointment to the Department of Sociology. She was Director of the Women’s Studies Program at Delaware 1985-91 and 1992-93.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1996 she was Adjunct Professor of Philosophy and Women’s Studies at UCLA on a half-time basis. In 1996 she was appointed Director of the UCLA Center for the Study of Women, which is a research institute. She held that position until 2000. Meanwhile, since 1996 she has been a Professor in the Graduate Department of Education and the Department of Gender Studies at UCLA. In 2012 she was appointed Distinguished Professor of Education and Gender Studies. From 2000 to 2005 she also was co-editor of \"Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society\".\n\nShe has held Visiting Professor appointments at the University of Amsterdam (1987), University of Costa Rica (1990), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH) (1987), and the Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok (1994). In 2011 she was appointed a Distinguished Affiliate Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Michigan State University, East Lansing.\n\nShe has been a consultant to several United Nations organizations including the U.N. Commission on Science and Technology for Development, the Pan American Health Organization, UNESCO, and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. She was invited to co-edit a chapter of UNESCO’s World Science Report 1996 on “The Gender Dimension of Science and Technology:” This 56 page account was the first such attempt to bring gender issues in science and technology to such a global-scale and prestigious context. She was invited to contribute a chapter to UNESCO’s World Social Science Report 2010 on “Standpoint Methodologies and Epistemologies: a Logic of Scientific Inquiry for People.”\n\nShe has served on the editorial boards of numerous journals in the fields of philosophy, women’s studies, science studies, social research methodology, and African philosophy. She has lectured at more than 300 colleges, universities, and conferences in North America as well as in Central America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Her books, essays and book chapters have been translated into dozens of languages and reprinted in hundreds of anthologies.\n\nThe gender, race, colonial and postcolonial issues on which she has focused have been controversial within scholarly circles. They have also reached popular awareness during several episodes of the “culture wars.” The John Birch Society wrote to the President of the University of Delaware in 1981 objecting to her employment there because she was sponsoring lectures that provided class perspectives on U.S. history. During the “Science Wars” of the 1990s, her work became a main target of criticisms of feminist and sociological approaches to understanding how the natural sciences and their particular historical surrounding social orders (pro- and anti- democratic) have provided intellectual and political resources for each other. Her essay on “Science is ‘Good to Think With’” was the lead article in the issue of the journal \"Social Text\" that also included the Sokal Hoax, which focused on her work among others. Her work was also a main target of Paul Gross and Norman Levitt’s \"Higher Superstition\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Dubrovnik, Republic of Ragusa, where he was first schooled. He moved to Rome by the order of his uncle, a vicar general of Dubrovnik, Petar Benessa. In Rome and in Bologna he studied philosophy, theology, law and mathematics. His mathematics professor in Rome was Bonaventura Cavalieri and in Bologna his mathematics professor was Benedetto Castelli. He became a priest in 1643, the year he returned home and soon became abbot of the Benedictine abbey of St. Cosmas and Damian on the island of Pašman, canon of cathedral choir in Dubrovnik and Dubrovnik deputy Archbishop.

He cooperated with the historian Joannes Lucius in defending the honor and reputation of their native country of unjust attacks of some Italian and French writers, translated classical authors, wrote a biography of the Dubrovnik writer Junije Palmotić and a poem about the earthquake in Dubrovnik. In the literary and scientific circle of pope Alexander VII and Queen Christina of Sweden Gradić discussed scientific and philosophical issues.\n\nHis philosophical works are written in the spirit of Aristotelianism and scholasticism. Gradić was a member of the Royal Academy in Padua, having correspondence with many notable Europeans. He described the disastrous earthquake in Dubrovnik in 1667 in Latin verses and organized help from all over Europe for the devastated city.\n\nAlong with philosophy, he engaged in mathematics, physics, astronomy, literature and diplomacy. In mathematics, he dealt with Galileo's paradox. This work went unnoticed and was even unknown to Roger Joseph Boscovich who was a professor of mathematics at the Collegium Romanum where a century before Gradić had been an alumnus. In his only printed mathematical treatise \"De loco Galilaei quo punctum lineae aequale pronuntiat\" published in the collection \"Dissertationes physico-mathematicae quatuor\" he disputed the concept of indivisible and developed a series of ideas en route to infinitesimal method. He was solving many mathematical problems which are left in his own inheritance and correspondence with other mathematicians as well, including those of Ghetaldus such as the first problem from Ghetaldus' work \"Apollonius redivivus\". In scientific correspondence with Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Honoré Fabri he published works dealing with the natural causes of motion and the laws of acceleration and falling bodies. He wrote on the problem of true and apparent position of the polar star.\n\n"}
{"id": "1943760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1943760", "title": "Structural anthropology", "text": "Structural anthropology\n\nStructural anthropology is a school of anthropology based on Claude Lévi-Strauss' idea that immutable deep structures exist in all cultures, and consequently, that all cultural practices have homologous counterparts in other cultures, essentially that all cultures are equitable.\n\nLévi-Strauss' approach arose in large part from dialectics expounded on by Marx and Hegel, though dialectics (as a concept) dates back to Ancient Greek philosophy. Hegel explains that every situation presents two opposing things and their resolution; Fichte had termed these \"thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.\" Lévi-Strauss argued that cultures also have this structure. He showed, for example, how opposing ideas would fight and were resolved to establish the rules of marriage, mythology and ritual. This approach, he felt, made for fresh new ideas. He stated:\n\nOnly those who practice structural analysis are aware of what they are actually trying to do: that is, to reunite perspectives that the \"narrow\" scientific outlook of recent centuries believed to be mutually exclusive: sensibility and intellect, quality and quantity, the concrete and the geometrical, or as we say today, the \"etic\" and the \"emic.\"\n\nIn South America he showed that there are \"dual organizations\" throughout Amazon rainforest cultures, and that these \"dual organizations\" represent opposites and their synthesis. As an illustration, Gê tribes of the Amazon were found to divide their villages into two rival halves; however, members from each half married each other, resolving the opposition\n\nCulture, he claimed, has to take into account both life and death and needs to have a way of mediating between the two. Mythology (see his several-volume \"Mythologies\") unites opposites in diverse ways.\n\nThree of the most prominent structural anthropologists are Lévi-Strauss himself and the British neo-structuralists Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach. The latter was the author of such essays as \"Time and False Noses\" (in \"Rethinking Anthropology\").\n\nLévi-Strauss took many ideas from structural linguistics, including those of Ferdinand de Saussure, Roman Jakobson, Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss. Saussure argued that linguists needed to move beyond the recording of \"parole\" (individual speech acts) and come to an understanding of \"langue\", the grammar of each language.\n\nLévi-Strauss applied this distinction in his search for mental structures that underlie all acts of human behavior: Just as speakers can talk without awareness of grammar, he argued, humans are unaware of the workings of social structures in daily life. The structures that form the \"deep grammar\" of society originate in the mind and operate unconsciously (albeit not in a Freudian sense).\n\nAnother concept was borrowed from the Prague school of linguistics, which employed so-called binary oppositions in their research. Roman Jakobson and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features, such as \"voiceless\" vs. \"voiced\". Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the mind's universal structures. For him, opposites formed the basis of social structure and culture.\n\nIn his early work Lévi-Strauss argued that tribal kinship groups were usually found in pairs, or in paired groups that oppose each other yet need one another. For example, in the Amazon basin, two extended families would build their houses in two facing semicircles that together form a big circle. He showed too that the ways people initially categorized animals, trees, and other natural features, were based on a series of oppositions.\n\nIn his most popular work, \"The Raw and the Cooked\", he described folk tales of tribal South America as related to one another through a series of transformations—as one opposite in tales \"here\" changed into its opposite in tales \"there.\" For example, as the title implies, raw becomes its opposite cooked. These particular opposites (raw/cooked) are symbolic of human culture itself, in which by means of thought and labour (economics), raw materials become clothes, food, weapons, art and ideas.\n\nWhile Durkheim thought that taxonomies of the natural world are collective in origin (the \"collective conscious\"), meaning that social structures influence individual cognitive structures, Lévi-Strauss proposed the opposite, arguing that it is the latter that gives rise to the former. Social structures mirror cognitive structures, meaning that patterns in social interaction can be treated as their manifestations. While structural-functionalists looked for structures within social organisation, structuralism seeks to identify links between structures of thought and social structures. Possibly the most significant influence on structuralism came from Mauss' \"The Gift\". Mauss argued that gifts are not free, but rather oblige the recipient to reciprocate. Through the gift, the givers give part of themselves, imbuing the gift a certain power that compels a response. Gift exchanges, therefore play a crucial role in creating and maintaining social relationships by establishing bonds of obligations. Gifts are not merely physical, incidental objects; they possess cultural and spiritual properties. It is a \"total prestation\" as Mauss called it, as it carries the power to create a system of reciprocity in which the honour of both giver and recipient are engaged. Social relationships are therefore based on exchange; Durkheimian solidarity, according to Mauss, is best achieved through structures of reciprocity and related systems of exchange.\n\nLévi-Strauss took this idea and postulated three fundamental properties of the human mind: a) people follow rules; b) reciprocity is the simplest way to create social relationships; c) a gift binds both giver and recipient in a continuing social relationship\n\nStructures are universal; their realization is culturally specific. Lévi-Strauss argued that exchange is the universal basis of kinship systems, the structures of which depend on the type of marriage rules that apply. Because of its strong focus on vertical social relations, Lévi-Strauss' model of kinship systems came to be called alliance theory.\n\nLévi-Strauss' model attempted to offer a single explanation for cross-cousin marriage, sister-exchange, dual organization and rules of exogamy. Over time, marriage rules create social structures because marriages are primarily forged between groups and not just between spouses. When groups exchange women on a regular basis, they marry together; consequently, each marriage creates a debtor/creditor relationship that must be balanced through the \"repayment\" of wives, either immediately or in the next generation.\n\nLévi-Strauss proposed that the initial motivation for the exchange of women was the incest taboo. He deemed this the beginning and essence of culture, as it was the first prohibition to check natural impulses; secondarily, it divides labor by gender. Prescribing exogamy creates a distinction between marriageable and tabooed women that necessitates a search for women outside one's own kin group (\"marry out or die out\") and fosters exchange relationships with other groups. Exogamy promotes inter-group alliances and forms structures of social networks.\n\nLévi-Strauss also discovered that a wide range of historically unrelated cultures had the rule that individuals should marry their cross-cousin, meaning children of siblings of the opposite sex - from a male perspective that is either the FZD (father's sister's daughter) or the MBD (mother's brother's daughter). Accordingly, he grouped all possible kinship systems into a scheme containing three basic kinship structures constructed out of two types of exchange. He called the three kinship structures elementary, semi-complex and complex.\n\nElementary structures are based on positive marriage rules that specify whom a person must marry, while complex systems specify negative marriage rules (whom one must not marry), thus leaving room for choice based on preference. Elementary structures can operate based on two forms of exchange: restricted (or direct) exchange, a symmetric form of exchange between two groups (also called moieties) of wife-givers and wife-takers; in an initial restricted exchange FZ marries MB, with all children then being bilateral cross-cousins (the daughter is both MBD and FZD). Continued restricted exchange means that the two lineages marry together. Restricted exchange structures are generally quite uncommon.\n\nThe second form of exchange within elementary structures is called generalised exchange, meaning that a man can only marry either his MBD (matrilateral cross-cousin marriage) or his FZD (patrilateral cross-cousin marriage). This involves an asymmetric exchange between at least three groups. Matrilateral cross-cousin marriage arrangements where the marriage of the parents is repeated by successive generations are very common in parts of Asia (e.g. amongst the Kachin). Lévi-Strauss considered generalised exchange to be superior to restricted exchange because it allows the integration of indefinite numbers of groups. Examples of restricted exchange are found, for instance, in the Amazon basin. These tribal societies are made up of multiple moieties that often split up, rendering them comparatively unstable. Generalised exchange is more integrative but contains an implicit hierarchy, as e.g. amongst the Kachin where wife-givers are superior to wife-takers. Consequently, the last wife-taking group in the chain is significantly inferior to the first wife-giving group to which it is supposed to give its wives. These status inequalities can destabilise the entire system or can at least lead to an accumulation of wives (and in the case of the Kachin, also of bridewealth) at one end of the chain.\n\nFrom a structural perspective matrilateral cross-cousin marriage is superior to its patrilateral counterpart; the latter has less potential to produce social cohesion since its exchange cycles are shorter (the direction of wife exchange is reversed in each successive generation). Lévi-Strauss' theory is supported by fact that patrilateral cross-cousin marriage is in fact the rarest of three types. However, matrilateral generalised exchange poses a risk as group A depends on receiving a woman from a group that it has not itself given a woman to, producing a less immediate obligation to reciprocate compared to a restricted exchange system. The risk created by such a delayed return is obviously lowest in restricted exchange systems.\n\nLévi-Strauss proposed a third structure between elementary and complex structures, called semi-complex structure or Crow-Omaha system. Semi-complex structures contain so many negative marriage rules that they effectively prescribe marriage to specific parties, thus somewhat resembling elementary structures. These structures are found, for example, among the Crow Nation and Omaha Native Americans in the United States.\n\nIn Lévi-Strauss' view, the basic building block of kinship is not just the nuclear family, as in structural-functionalism, but the so-called kinship atom: the nuclear family together with the wife's brother. This \"mother's brother\" (from the perspective of the wife-seeking son) plays a crucial role in alliance theory, as he is the one who ultimately decides whom his daughter will marry. Moreover, it is not just the nuclear family as such, but alliances between families that matter in regard to the creation of social structures, reflecting the typical structuralist argument that the position of an element in the structure is more significant than the element itself. Descent theory and alliance theory therefore look at two sides of one coin: the former emphasising bonds of consanguinity (kinship by blood), the latter stressing bonds of affinity (kinship by law or choice).\n\nMuch earlier, and some 450 miles north of Paris, a specific type of applied anthropology emerged at Leiden University, Netherlands that focused frequently on the relationship between apparent cultural phenomena found in the Indonesian archipelago: Batak, Minangkabau, Moluccas, etc., though it was primarily aimed at training governors for colonial Indonesia. This type of anthropology, developed by late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century scholars, was eventually called \"de Leidse Richting,\" or \"de Leidse School,\".\n\nMultiple researchers were educated in this school. This theory attracted students and researchers interested in a holistic approach, that was broad and deep, that related economic circumstances with mythological and spatial classifications and that explored the relationship between the natural world and religious, symbolic systems. This was long before structuralism. The \"Leiden\" perspective drove research for many decades, influencing successive generations of anthropologists.\n\nThe most recent chairs were held by J. P. B. de Josselin de Jong (chair: 1922–1956, 1964), who coined the concept of the Field of Ethnological Study in 1935, and later his nephew P. E. de Josselin de Jong (chair: 1956–1987, 1999).\n\nThe British brand of structuralism was mainly espoused by Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach, who were both critical towards the structural-functionalist perspective and who drew on Lévi-Strauss as well as Arthur Maurice Hocart. They also found grounds for critiquing Lévi-Strauss. Leach was more concerned with researching people's actual lives than with the discovery of universal mental structures.\n\nHe found that the latter's analysis of the Kachin contained serious flaws. According to Leach, Lévi-Strauss' project had been overly ambitious, meaning that his analyses were too superficial and the available data treated with too little care. While part of his analysis of the Kachin was simply based on incorrect ethnographic information, the rest reflected Kachin ideology but not actual practice.\n\nIn theory, Kachin groups were supposed to marry in a circle ideally consisting of five groups. In reality, the system was strongly unbalanced with built-in status differences between wife-givers and wife-takers. Lévi-Strauss had incorrectly assumed that wife-takers would be of higher rank than wife-givers; in reality, it was the other way round, and the former usually had to make substantial bridewealth payments to obtain wives. Overall, some lineages would accumulate more wives and material wealth than others, meaning that the system was not driven primarily by reciprocity. The marriage system was quite messy and the chance of it breaking down increased with the number of groups involved.\n\nIn generalised exchange systems, more groups imply greater complexity to ensure that all wife-givers will eventually be on the receiving end, an issue that Lévi-Strauss had already foreseen. He thought that in practice there would be competition for women, leading to accumulation and therefore asymmetries in the system. According to Leach, in Kachin reality instabilities arose primarily from competition for bridewealth. Men sought to get the maximum profit in forms of either bridewealth or political advantage from their daughters' marriage. Lévi-Strauss had only accorded a symbolic role to marriage prestations, effectively overlooking their significance within the system. Leach argued that they are also (or even primarily) economic and political transactions and are frequently connected to transfers of rights over land, too.\n\nMarriage exchanges need to be analysed within their wider economic and political context rather than in isolation, as Lévi-Strauss attempted. Leach charged the latter with neglecting the effects of material conditions on social relations. He also challenged the claims to universality made by Lévi-Strauss about the model, doubting whether structures generated by marriage rules would be the same in different social contexts.\n\nBy the late 1970s/early 1980s, alliance theory had lost influence. With the advent of postmodern, interpretive-hermeneutic thought, structuralist and functionalist theories went receded. Internal incoherence and a range of intrinsic limitations further reduced its appeal.\n\nBy overstressing the structural significance of affinal ties, alliance theory effectively neglected the importance of descent and genealogical ties. Some societies (e.g. African tribal societies) employ descent as their primary organizational principle. In others, alliances are of primary significance, as in e.g. many Southeast-Asian societies and amongst Amazon tribes; and still others emphasise both. The Yanomami fit very well into the alliance theory mold, while the Tallensi or Azande do not. Holý (1996) pointed out that some Middle-Eastern societies cannot be conclusively explained by either descent or alliance theory.\n\nCritics also saw weaknesses in Lévi-Strauss' methods, in the fact that he looked for ideal structures, thereby neglecting the reality and complexity of actual practices. His model explained practices that were not observed. Kuper pointed out that if the structures of the mind really are universal and Lévi-Strauss' model is correct, then why do not all human societies act accordingly and structure their kinship systems around alliances and exchanges? Kuper allowed that exchange was the universal form of marriage, but there could be other significant factors. And even if reciprocity was the primary principle that underlies marriages, the return would not have to be in kind but could take other forms (such as money, livestock, services or favours of various kinds). Also, social cohesion through reciprocity does not have to rest primarily on the bride exchange. Mauss showed that different cultures use all kinds of gifts to create and maintain alliances.\n\nFeminists critique Lévi-Strauss' claim that the underlying principle according to which all societies work is the exchange of women by men, who dispose of them as if they were objects. Others, for example Godelier, critiqued structuralism's synchronic approach that led it to be essentially ahistorical.\n\nMarxists shifted the attention within anthropology from an almost exclusive preoccupation with kinship to an emphasis on economic issues. For them, social structures were primarily shaped by material conditions, property relations and class struggles.\n\nStructuralism's main propositions were not formulated in a way so that they could be subject to verification or falsification. Lévi-Strauss did not develop a framework that could prove the existence of his concept of the fundamental structures of human thought, but simply assumed their existence. Boyer pointed out that experimental research on concepts in psychology have not supported a structuralistic view of concepts, but rather a theory-oriented or prototype-based view.\n\n\n\n"}

Tao Yin, is also said to be a primary formative ingredient in the well-known \"soft style\" Chinese martial art, T'ai Chi Ch'uan.\n\nThe main goal of Tao yin is to create balance between internal and external energies and to revitalize the body, mind and spirit, developing strength and flexibility in muscles and tendons.\n\nA painted scroll on display at the Hunan Provincial Museum and known as the Daoyintu found in tomb three at Mawangdui in 1973 and dated to 168 BC shows coloured drawings of 44 figures in standing and sitting postures doing Tao yin exercises. It is the earliest physical exercise chart in the world so far and illustrates a medical system which does not rely on external factors such as medication, surgery or treatments but internal factors to prevent disease.\n\nThe images include men and women, young and old. Their postures and movements differ from one another. Some are sitting, some are standing, and still others are practising Daoyintu or exercising using apparatuses.\n\nTranslation of the texts covering the document show that the early Chinese were aware of the need for both preventative and treatment based breathing exercises.\nThe exercises can be divided into three categories:\nA typical Tao Yin exercise will involve movement of the arms and body in time with controlled inhalation and exhalation. Each exercise is designed with a different goal in mind, for example calmative effects or expanded lung capacity.\n\nAccording to Mantak Chia (Taoist Master and creator of the Universal Healing Tao System) the practice of Tao Yin has the following effects: harmonization of the chi, relaxation of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, training of the \"second brain\" in the lower abdomen, improvement of health and structural alignment.\n\n\n"}

The book focuses on the extreme impact of rare and unpredictable outlier events — and the human tendency to find simplistic explanations for these events, retrospectively. Taleb calls this the Black Swan theory.\n\nThe book covers subjects relating to knowledge, aesthetics, as well as ways of life, and uses elements of fiction and anecdotes from the author's life to elaborate his theories. The book spent 36 weeks on the \"New York Times\" best-seller list\n\nThe book is part of Taleb's five volume series, titled the \"Incerto\" including \"Fooled by Randomness\" (2001), \"The Black Swan\" (2007–2010)\", \"The Bed of Procrustes\" (2010–2016), \"Antifragile\" (2012), and \"Skin in the Game\" (2018).\n\nA central idea in Taleb's book is not to attempt to predict Black Swan events, but to build robustness to negative events and an ability to exploit positive events. Taleb contends that banks and trading firms are vulnerable to hazardous Black Swan events and are exposed to losses beyond those predicted by their defective financial models.\n\nThe book asserts that a \"Black Swan\" event depends on the observer, e.g., what may be a Black Swan surprise for a turkey is not a Black Swan surprise for its butcher. Hence the objective should be to \"avoid being the turkey\", by identifying areas of vulnerability in order to \"turn the Black Swans white\".\n\nTaleb refers to the book variously as an essay or a narrative with one single idea: \"our blindness with respect to randomness, particularly large deviations.\" \n\nThe book's layout follows \"a simple logic\", moving from literary subjects in the beginning to scientific and mathematical subjects in the later portions. Part One and the beginning of Part Two delve into psychology. Taleb addresses science and business in the latter half of Part Two and Part Three. Part Four contains advice on how to approach the world in the face of uncertainty and still enjoy life.\n\nTaleb acknowledges a contradiction in the book. He uses an exact metaphor, the Black Swan idea to argue against the \"unknown, the abstract, and imprecise uncertain—white ravens, pink elephants, or evaporating denizens of a remote planet orbiting Tau Ceti.\"\n\nIn the first chapter, the Black Swan theory is first discussed in relation to Taleb's coming of age in the Levant. The author then elucidates his approach to historical analysis. He describes history as opaque, essentially a black box of cause and effect. One sees events go in and events go out, but one has no way of determining which produced what effect. Taleb argues this is due to \"The Triplet of Opacity\".\n\nThe second chapter discusses a neuroscientist named Yevgenia Nikolayevna Krasnova and her book \"A Story of Recursion\". She published her book on the web and was discovered by a small publishing company; they published her unedited work and the book became an international bestseller. The small publishing firm became a big corporation, and Yevgenia became famous. This incident is described as a Black Swan event.\n\nThe book goes on to admit that the so-called author is a work of fiction. Yevgenia rejects the distinction between fiction and nonfiction. She also hates the very idea of forcing things into well defined \"categories\", holding that the world generally is complex and not easy to define. Though female, the character is based, in part, autobiographically on the author (according to Taleb), who has many of the same traits.\n\nThe third chapter introduces the concepts of \"Extremistan\" and \"Mediocristan\". He uses them as guides to define how predictable the environment one's studying is. \"Mediocristan\" environments safely can use Gaussian distribution. In \"Extremistan\" environments, a Gaussian distribution should be used at one's own peril.\n\nChapter four brings together the topics discussed earlier, into a narrative about a turkey. Taleb uses it to illustrate the philosophical problem of induction and how past performance is no indicator of future performance. He then takes the reader into the history of skepticism.\n\nIn chapter nine, Taleb outlines the multiple topics he previously has described and connects them as a single basic idea.\n\nIn chapter thirteen, the book discusses what can be done regarding epistemic arrogance. He recommends avoiding unnecessary dependence on large-scale harmful predictions, while being less cautious with smaller matters, such as going to a picnic. He makes a distinction between the American cultural perception of failure versus European and Asian stigma and embarrassment regarding failure: the latter is more tolerable for people taking small risks. He also describes the \"barbell strategy\" for investment he used as a trader, which consists in avoiding medium risk investments and putting 85–90% of money in the safest instruments available and the remaining 10–15% on extremely speculative bets.\n\nThe term \"black swan\" was a Latin expression: its oldest reference is in the poet Juvenal's expression that \"a good person is as rare as a black swan\" (\"rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno\", 6.165). It was a common expression in 16th century London, as a statement that describes impossibility, deriving from the old world presumption that 'all swans must be white', because all historical records of swans reported that they had white feathers. Thus, the black swan is an oft cited reference in philosophical discussions of the improbable. Aristotle's \"Prior Analytics\" is the most likely original reference that makes use of example syllogisms involving the predicates \"white\", \"black\", and \"swan.\" More specifically, Aristotle uses the white swan as an example of necessary relations and the black swan as improbable. This example may be used to demonstrate either deductive or inductive reasoning; however, neither form of reasoning is infallible, since in inductive reasoning, the premises of an argument may support a conclusion, but do not ensure it, and similarly, in deductive reasoning, an argument is dependent on the truth of its premises. That is, a false premise may lead to a false result and inconclusive premises also will yield an inconclusive conclusion. The limits of the argument behind \"all swans are white\" is exposed—it merely is based on the limits of experience (e.g., that every swan one has seen, heard, or read about is white). The point of this metaphor is that all known swans were white until the discovery of black swans in Australia. Hume's attack against induction and causation is based primarily on the limits of everyday experience and so too, the limitations of scientific knowledge.\n\nMathematics professor David Aldous argued that \"Taleb is sensible (going on prescient) in his discussion of financial markets and in some of his general philosophical thought, but tends toward irrelevance or ridiculous exaggeration otherwise.\" Gregg Easterbrook wrote a critical review of \"The Black Swan\" in the \"New York Times\" to which Taleb replied with a list of logical errors, blaming Easterbrook for not having read the book. Giles Foden, writing for \"The Guardian\" in 2007, described the book as insightful, but facetiously written, saying that Nassim's \"dumbed-down\" style was a central problem, especially in comparison to Taleb's \"Fooled by Randomness\".\n\nThe Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman wrote \"\"The Black Swan\" changed my view of how the world works\" and explains the influence in his 2011 book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\".\n\nSince being published in 2007, as of February 2011 it has sold close to three million copies. It spent 36 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list; 17 as hardcover and 19 weeks as paperback. It was published in 32 languages.\n\n\n"}

Also included are Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nAmong the themes of the book are apophatic theology and intellectualism versus practice. Armstrong claims that the fundamental reality, later called God, Brahman, nirvana or Tao, transcends human concepts and thoughts, and can only be known through devoted religious practice.\n\nIn 2009, the book was awarded the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize by the University of Tübingen in recognition of its contribution to the fields of theology, philosophy and intellectual history, and for improving international understanding and tolerance among faiths.\n\nIn the introduction, Armstrong presents two forms of knowledge, \"mythos\" and \"logos\". Since the 16th and 17th century, she says \"logos\" governed civilization, resulting in two phenomena: fundamentalism and atheism. Armstrong says that the \"new\" atheists have made some valid criticisms of religion, stating \"I can sympathize with the irritation of the new atheists\". But she maintains that they have focused primarily on fundamentalism. She says they \"aren't radical enough\" and finds their work \"disappointingly shallow\".

{"id": "634135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634135", "title": "The Cloud of Unknowing", "text": "The Cloud of Unknowing\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing (Middle English: \"The Cloude of Unknowyng\") is an anonymous work of Christian mysticism written in Middle English in the latter half of the 14th century. The text is a spiritual guide on contemplative prayer in the late Middle Ages. The underlying message of this work suggests that the way to know God is to abandon consideration of God's particular activities and attributes, and be courageous enough to surrender one's mind and ego to the realm of \"unknowing\", at which point one may begin to glimpse the nature of God.\n\n\"The Cloud of Unknowing\" draws on the mystical tradition of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Christian Neoplatonism, which focuses on the via negativa road to discovering God as a pure entity, beyond any capacity of mental conception and so without any definitive image or form. This tradition has reputedly inspired generations of mystical searchers from John Scotus Eriugena, Nicholas of Cusa, and John of the Cross, to Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (the latter two of whom may have been influenced by \"The Cloud\" itself). Prior to this, the theme of \"The Cloud\" had appeared in the \"Confessions of St. Augustine\" (IX, 10) written in AD 398.\n\nThe author is unknown. The English Augustinian mystic Walter Hilton has at times been suggested, but this is generally doubted. It is possible he was a Carthusian priest, though this is not certain.\n\nA second major work by the same author, \"The Book of Privy Counseling\" (originally titled \"Prive Counselling\"), continues the themes discussed in the \"Cloud\". It is less than half the size of the \"Cloud\", appears to be the author's final work, and clarifies and deepens some of its teachings. In this work, the author characterizes the practice of contemplative unknowing as worshiping God with one's \"substance,\" coming to rest in a \"naked blind feeling of being\", and ultimately finding thereby that God is one's being.\n\nThe book counsels a young student to seek God, not through knowledge and intellection (faculty of the human mind), but through intense contemplation, motivated by love, and stripped of all thought. This is brought about by putting all thoughts and desires under a \"cloud of forgetting,\" and thereby piercing God's cloud of unknowing with a \"dart of longing love\" from the heart. This form of contemplation is not directed by the intellect, but involves spiritual union with God through the heart:\nChapters 39 and 40 recommend the focus on a single word as the means to invoke the fullness of God:\nChapter 23 of \"The Book of Privy Counseling\" glorifies experience over knowledge:\nIn addition to \"The Cloud of Unknowing\" and \"The Book of Privy Counseling\", the \"Cloud\" author is believed to be responsible for a few other spiritual treatises and translations, including:\n\n\n\"The Cloud of Unknowing\" has 17 known manuscripts. The two best known are British Library MS Harleian 674 and Cambridge University Library Kk.vi.26. These contain all seven of the works attributed to the \"Cloud\" author, the former extensively glossed in Latin. Another important manuscript is British Library Harleian 2373, which contains all but \"Deonise Hid Divinity\".\n\nGiven its survival in only seventeen manuscripts, \"The Cloud of Unknowing\" was not as popular in late medieval England as the works of Richard Rolle or Walter Hilton, perhaps because the \"Cloud\" is addressed to solitaries and concentrates on the advanced levels of the mystical path. Two Latin translations of the \"Cloud\" were made in the late fifteenth century. One was made by Richard Methley, a Carthusian of the Charterhouse of Mount Grace in Yorkshire, and finished in 1491. The other is anonymous. Neither, however, enjoyed wide dissemination.\n\nThis work became known to English Catholics in the mid 17th century, when the Benedictine monk, Augustine Baker (1575–1641), wrote an exposition on its doctrine based on a manuscript copy in the library of the monastery of Cambrai in Flanders. The original work itself, however, was not published until 1877. English mystic Evelyn Underhill edited an important version of the work in 1922.\n\nThe work has become increasingly popular over the course of the twentieth century, with nine English translations or modernisations produced in this period. In particular, \"The Cloud\" has influenced recent contemplative prayer practices. The practical prayer advice contained in \"The Cloud of Unknowing\" forms a primary basis for the contemporary practice of Centering Prayer, a form of Christian meditation developed by Trappist monks William Meninger, Basil Pennington and Thomas Keating in the 1970s. It also informed the meditation techniques of the English Benedictine John Main.\n\nThe contemplation method urged in \"The Cloud\" is similar to Buddhist meditation and modern transcendental meditation. For example, the last paragraph of chapter 7 says: If you want to gather all your desire into one simple word that the mind can easily retain, choose a short word rather than a long one. A one-syllable word such as \"God\" or \"love\" is best. But choose one that is meaningful to you. Then fix it in your mind so that it will remain there come what may. This word will be your defence in conflict and in peace. Use it to beat upon the cloud of darkness above you and to subdue all distractions, consigning them to the \"cloud of forgetting\" beneath you.\n\n\n\nEditions of related texts include\n\n\n\n"}

He was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains and sought to dig through them with hoes and baskets. When questioned as to the seemingly impossible nature of his task, the Foolish Old Man replied that while he may not finish this task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children, and their children, and so on through the many generations, some day the mountains would be removed if he persevered. The gods in Heaven, impressed with his hard work and perseverance, ordered the mountains separated.\n\nIn a speech at Yan'an on 11 June 1945, Mao Zedong recounted the story, re-interpreting it as a call for collective action:\nToday, two big mountains lie like a dead weight on the Chinese people. One is imperialism, the other is feudalism. The Chinese Communist Party has long made up its mind to dig them up. We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we, too, will touch God's heart. Our God is none other than the masses of the Chinese people. If they stand up and dig together with us, why can't these two mountains be cleared away?\nTogether with \"Serve the People\" and \"Memory of Norman Bethune\" (紀念白求恩), it was one of the three most-frequently read stories in the \"Little Red Book\" of Mao's sayings and was memorized by schoolchildren during the Cultural Revolution.\n\n\n"}

He was Professor Emeritus of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the New School for Social Research in New York. Yovel had also been a political columnist in Israel, cultural and political critic and a frequent presence in the media. Yovel was a laureate of the Israel Prize in philosophy and \"officier\" of the French order of the Palme académique. His books were translated into English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Hebrew, Korean and Japanese. Yovel was married to Shoshana Yovel, novelist and community organizer, and they had a son, Jonathan Yovel, poet and law professor, and a daughter, Ronny, classical musician, TV host and family therapist.\n\nBorn in Haifa, Palestine, then under a British mandate, Yirmiyahu Yovel graduated in 1953 from the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa. Following his mandatory military service he studied philosophy and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, completing his B.A. in 1961 and M.A. in 1964. He supported his studies as radio news editor and presenter. However, he declined a permanent career in broadcasting and went to the Sorbonne and Princeton University to complete his philosophical studies. In 1968 he earned his PhD from the Hebrew University. His adviser was Nathan Rothenstreich.\n\nYovel came to the university driven by existential philosophical concerns and suspicious of rationalism. Upholding individual subjectivity, young Yovel was estranged from the collectivist ideals and political ideologies of the time (including the socialist-Zionist ethos), because of their demand to monopolize and politicize all intellectual concerns. Religion, too, was not the answer, but rather an escape. Yovel has shared from the start Nietzsche's radical drive to existential lucidity, which can be emotionally taxing but also liberating.\n\nIt was, in particular, Kant's program of critical reason (though not its actual execution), and the concept of finite rationality that provided Yovel with the terms for a constructive critique of rationalism, one that recognizes rationality as indispensable for human life and culture, even while taking its finitude more radically than Kant's, by admitting its fallibility, open-endedness, and non-absolute nature.\n\nYovel holds that the history of philosophy is embedded in most philosophical discourse, and that often it contains issues and insights that can be fruitfully contemporized by a method of immanent reconstruction. His own philosophical position can be described as \"a philosophy of immanence,\" which, following Spinoza, views the immanent world as all there is and as the sole possible source of social and political normativity. The latter theme was extensively probed in his two-volume Spinoza and Other Heretics (Princeton, 1989), which traces the idea of immanence back to Spinoza and follows its adventures in later thinkers of modernity from Kant and Hegel to Nietzsche and beyond.\n\nYovel was to return as visiting professor both to Princeton University (1970–71) and the Sorbonne (1978–80), among other foreign appointments. His years on both sides of the Atlantic helped shape Yovel's attitude towards Anglo-American analytic philosophy. He shares its demand for clarity and precision – this was recognized as a hallmark of his writing – but criticized its often scholastic tendencies and a-historical approach.\n\nFollowing his academic and public activity Yirmiyahu Yovel became a prominent voice in Israeli intellectual life. His numerous columns in major papers, mostly Ha'aretz and Yediot Aharonot, probed public attitudes and government policies. He was an early advocate of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, and strongly opposed the settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza as politically wrong and motivated by false Messianism.\n\nYovel's involvement in journalism started in his student days. In 1960–64 he worked for radio Israel and co-founded its weekly news magazine. In 1967 he participated in the project of creating an independent Israeli broadcasting authority, serving two terms on its council. Later he edited the first political documentaries of Israel TV, and during 1975–1978 he edited and hosted 30 major TV programs on social and political issues (drugs, gay liberation, divorce, adoption, violence in sports, Arab land rights; the right to die, etc.). His viewers also remembered him as a military reporter in the Sinai frontline in both the 1967 and 1973 war. In 1973 he was among the few journalists who insisted on reporting the truth about Israel's military setbacks in the early stage of the war.\n\nAfter Labor's historic defeat in 1977, he joined \"Circle 77,\" a group of intellectuals that tried to reform the Labor party, but found himself unfit for party politics. Henceforth he focused on the written press, publishing scores of political columns until the 1990s.\n\nMost of Yovel's career took place at the Hebrew University, where he served in various academic posts and held the Shulman Chair of Philosophy. During that time, he also visited and lectured in numerous universities and institutes worldwide including Columbia, Hamburg, Milan, Oxford, Paris IV (\"Sorbonne - Pantheon\"), and others. In 1994 he accepted an appointment to teach annually one-term at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research which became his \"second academic home.\" He was then nominated to the inaugural Hans Jonas Chair in Philosophy, from which he retired in 2010.\n\nIn 1986, Yovel founded the Jerusalem Spinoza Institute with a dual intention – to foster Spinoza scholarship, and to promote public education around ideas associated with Spinoza (such as democracy, secularism, and tolerance) both as all- European thinker and as an emblematic figure of Jewish modernity).\n\nIn 2000 Yovel won the Israel Prize for his achievements in philosophy. His thank-you address on behalf of his fellow laureates was entitled \"A Report on the State of Reason.\" Reason is alive and breathing, Yovel reported, but is besieged by inner and outer enemies. Reason's \"inner enemy\" is its over-ambitious tendency to exceed its limits and control, and three \"external enemies\": mysticism, global commercial culture, and post-modern radical critique. Yovel argued that these challenges can be tackled by a sober attitude, committed to reason all while accepting its fallibility, finitude, and lack of absolute character. This is rationality \"on a human scale,\" rather than a secular replica of religion.\n\nYirmiyahu Yovel's published numerous scholarly articles and several books, among them \"Kant and the Problem of History\" (Princeton 1980,86) \"Spinoza and Other Heretics\" (Princeton 1989), \"Dark Riddle: Hegel, Nietzsche and the Jews\" (Polity 1996) and \"The Other Within: The Marranos\" (Princeton 2013). He translated into Hebrew two major philosophical classics (Spinoza's \"Ethics\" and Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\") with systematic introductions, and edited several collective books, including a 5-volume encyclopedia of Jewish modern secular culture. Yovel's credits as journalist include dozens of press columns and 30 major TV programs.\n\nYovel's first book, based on his PhD dissertation, was \"Kant and the Renewal of Metaphysics\" (1974, in Hebrew.) While Kant had been often held to have destroyed metaphysics, Yovel's book argues that Kant's actual program was to renew it, by replacing the old dogmatic metaphysics with a new critical one. Metaphysical questions are deeply significant even when they exceed the range of legitimate answers. To either repress the questions or to pretend answering them is equally irrational. Reason in Kant has a metaphysical interest and a critical interest that are equally indispensable, yet contradict each other in the absence of a critique. The critical turn resolves this antinomy in two stages. First, it establishes a system of synthetic a-priori categories and principles that functions as a valid metaphysics of the immanent (empirical) domain; and, secondly, in the Dialectic, it re-orients the metaphysical drive from its search of empty, illusory objects back into the empirical world, and makes us realize our fundamental finitude, as well as the endlessly open horizons within this world which we can explore.\n\nBy metaphysics Kant understood a system of supersensible elements that (1) determines the entities in the sensible world, and (2) concerns the meaning of their being. The Kantian synthetic a-priori categories and principles fulfill the first role, but do so critically, since they are not supersensible objects existing in themselves but are only ingredients in the synthesis of empirical objects. As such they also determine what it means for empirical objects to be (namely, to be a synthesis of sense perceptions linked by the categories.) The \"a priori\" system is thus not only an epistemology, but equally an ontology of finite, natural beings.\n\nThe book also highlights the dynamic, self-driving nature of Kantian reason (which Yovel sometimes calls \"erotic\" in the Platonic sense). Human rationality is not a mere calculus in Kant but a goal-oriented activity, which projects its own inherent ends and strives to realize them. Finally, the book describes Kant's method as the self-explication of reason, which depends upon its own history, including a series of collapses, and culminates in a critical revolution.\n\nYovel's major work on Kant was to become his \"Kant and the Philosophy of History\" (Princeton 1980, 1986; French 1989). Kant's historical thought had for a long time been ignored, or dismissed as marginal and inconsistent. Yovel's work was instrumental in reversing this outlook. The book goes beyond Kant's customary moral teaching, which revolves on the formal and personal characteristics of morality, to uncover a second, material tier in Kant's practical philosophy, in which the moral will becomes a world-shaping will: the will is not satisfied with its personal morality alone, but works to reshape the entire social-historical world as \"a moral totality\". The will does not only strive to make itself good, but to reshape its world in its own image—to see its moral goals embodied in the actual world's ways and institutions. This makes possible a critical philosophy of history, and of particular areas within it—politics, law, social ethics, moral education, and a religion of reason.\n\nThe lever leading to the second stage is Kant's concept of \"The Highest Good\" and the imperative to promote it. A close analysis of this concept leads Yovel to interpret it as the Kantian regulative idea of history, an ideal that combines maximal morality (personal and institutional, ethical and political) with universal well-being and prosperity. Kant even calls the historical task \"the ultimate end of creation itself\"), thus suggesting that moral history, in which humans change themselves and reform the world, is the only possible justification of there being a world and a human race, which otherwise would be utterly contingent and meaningless.\n\nIn method, the book is not a narrative commentary but a systematic reconstruction. While relying on careful textual analyses, it organizes the material in relation to the inner logic and latent implications of Kant's positions, which allow Yovel to draw new conclusions that shed light on unknown aspects in his philosophy.\n\nThe book had strong echoes which reversed the traditional outlook. Today there is even talk of Kant's \"historical turn\", a concept unheard of in the past).\nA noted German philosopher, director of the Institut für Sozialforschung (Institute for Social Research, the institutional home of the Frankfurt School and critical theory) recently described the book's impact:\n\"When I first read Yirmiyahu Yovel's marvelous book on Kant and the Philosophy of History almost twenty years ago, I learned how one should approach the task of interpreting classical texts: Starting from the identification of a central problem in a philosopher`s writings, one must try rearrange the elements of the proposed solution until a new idea emerges that goes beyond the original author's explicit intentions. Because I was extremely impressed by this method the way it was applied to Kant's systematic thought, I not only became a regular and eager reader of Yirmiyahu Yovel's publications, but I also tried to emulate this mode of thinking in my own work\" (—Axel Honneth, 2010).\n\nYovel's best-known book is \"Spinoza and other Heretics\", (Princeton 1989), a diptych in two volumes that offers a new interpretation of the existential origins of Spinoza's intellectual revolution (Vol. I) and its developments in later thinkers of modernity (Vol. II). Spinoza appealed to Yovel primarily by his radical principle of immanence, which Yovel sees as paradigmatic of much of modern thought, and by his striking personal case. No modern thinker before Nietzsche has gone as far as Spinoza in shedding all historical religion and all horizons of transcendence. In wondering what had enabled Spinoza to tear himself so drastically from the Western theistic tradition, Yovel did not turn directly to the rational arguments that drove Spinoza, but looked first for the historico-existential situation that cleared the mental space for those arguments to emerge and take hold in the mind.\n\nThe answer, Yovel suggested, is linked to the dualities and confused religious identity of the peculiar Jewish group from which Spinoza came, the so-called Marranos, who before arriving in Holland had lived for generations in Spain and Portugal as forced converts from Judaism, absorbing Christian symbols, mental patterns and ways of thinking. Former Jews who tried to remain Jewish in secret had only scant knowledge of Judaism, and what they knew they conceptualized in Christian terms; while others, having mixed the two religions, ended up neither Jews nor Christians, and looked to the affairs of this life and this world as a substitute to religious salvation in either Jesus or Moses. However, describing the events of Marranos responding to the miracle in the Convent of São Domingos in Lisbon on April 19, 1506 with statements such as \"How can a piece of wood do miracles?\", or \"Put some water to it and it'll go out\", Yovel states that these words \"expressed the same rough Jewish common sense resisting the Catholic sense of mysterium and insisting on calling super-rational phenomena by their earthly names.\" The Marrano experience, Yovel suggests, made it possible for several ex-Marranos to adopt the immanent and \"secular\" standpoint which Spinoza radicalized and gave it a powerful systematization.\n\nVolume One (The Marrano of Reason) uses historical and literary materials to elicit a set of typical and recurring Marrano patterns (for example: life on two levels, overt and concealed; the use of equivocation and dual language; the search for an alternative way to salvation, replacing Jesus and Moses with philosophical reason, etc.) which in Spinoza are transposed from the context of religion to that of reason. From the other direction, key philosophical issues in Spinoza (language, politics and the multitude, the third kind of knowledge) are also, at the same time, shown to be responding to Marrano-like elements that further illuminate and contextualize them. Yovel insists that this contextualization is not reductive: Spinoza's ideas have an independent rational import that cannot be reduced to the historical circumstances that allowed them to arise.\n\nA heretic to all religions, Spinoza was banned by the rabbis but refused to convert to Christianity. By calling him \"the first modern Jew\", Yovel highlights his relevance to the Modern Jewish situation. His case - even more than his thought - anticipated most of the rival and contradicting solutions that were offered in later centuries to non-orthodox Jewish existence. Yet Spinoza himself neither advocated nor personally realized any of those options. He thus became, involuntarily, a founding father of almost all the forms of modern life in which he himself did not participate.\n\nVolume Two (The Adventures of Immanence) uncovers the presence of Spinoza's revolution in some major turns of modern thought. Yovel distinguishes between naturalism and the broader concept of a \"philosophy of immanence\". The latter maintains that (a) immanent reality is all there is, the overall horizon of being; (b) it is also (through humans) the only valid source of moral and political norms; and (c) interiorizing this recognition is a precondition to whatever liberation or redemption humans can hope for. Yovel takes the reader into the latent and overt conversation with Spinoza in the work of Kant, Hegel, the left-Hegelians (Heine, Feuerbach, Hess), Marx, Nietzsche and Freud - all of whom shared a core philosophy of immanence but worked it out in rival ways, which also diverge from Spinoza's. This approach makes vividly present Spinoza's influence on modernity, including Jewish modernity. In the Epilogue, speaking for himself, Yovel argues for a critical philosophy of immanence to modify Spinoza's \"dogmatic\" one.\n\nThe book was widely discussed and translated into French, German, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese.\n\nThis book treats the so-called \"Jewish question\"' as primarily a question for Europe with itself. Hegel was a philosopher of reason and Nietzsche its outright opponent; Hegel was a (heterodox) Christian and Nietzsche a self-proclaimed 'Antichrist'; Hegel sought to bring rational modernity to its climax and Nietzsche wanted to replace it with a \"Dionysian\"culture based upon the \"will to power\". Yet each in terms of his project had to grapple with the issue of Judaism and the Jews. The result was ambivalence of two different kinds.\n\nThe young Hegel manifested a harsh anti-Jewish attitude which his mature philosophy mitigated. Reversing his early claim that the Jews had contributed nothing worthwhile to humanity, the older Hegel went as far as to attribute to Judaism one of the most consequential turning points in human history: the recognition that absolute being is Spirit, not a thing or a natural entity, and that Spirit is higher than nature. Yet Judaism falsified its own revolution in the very act of performing it, because it shaped itself as \"a religion of sublimity\", by which Hegel means a religion of self-alienation and slavish submission to an infinitely remote Master, before whom the individual stands in dread as a complete nullity. In this dialectical fashion, the mature Hegel tacitly condemned the Jews in the very act of praising them. Furthermore, unlike Nietzsche, Hegel denied post-Christian Jews any historical significance and value. It followed from Hegel's logic of history that the Jews had lost their raison d'être already in antiquity and become the empty shell of their former self. Yet while he was puzzled and disturbed by their long survival as a theoretical paradox (a \"dark riddle\"), this did not prevent Hegel from supporting political emancipation and social acceptance for the contemporary Jews, an unpopular position in Germany at the time. Hegel looked down on German xenophobic nationalism, and as a philosopher of freedom he chose, without enthusiasm, to admit the Jews into the modern world as a necessary recognition of their humanity.\n\nNietzsche not only overcame the anti-Jewish prejudice of his early years but, unlike Hegel, did so with passion. Following his break with Wagner and Schopenhauer the mature Nietzsche came into his own as an ardent anti-anti-Semite. To him, the modern anti-Semite was a creature of ressentiment, and as such was the genealogical cousin of the ancient Jewish priest, whom Nietzsche despised with the same ardor, and for the same psycho-philosophical reasons. Nietzsche refused to attribute to Judaism a single unchanging essence. His attitude, as reconstructed in this book, varies according to three phases in Jewish history. (1)The Old Testament Hebrews were the object of Nietzsche's admiration on account of their grand figures, great deeds, and authentic self-affirmation. (2) Nietzsche loathed and reviled the ‘priestly' Judaism of the Second Temple (and Testament), primarily because it had engendered Christianity and the \"slave morality\" that corrupted Europe alongside Socratic rationalism. (3) He admired the Jews of the Diaspora because of their historical depth and the existential power they accumulated in centuries of resistance and perseverance. This power Nietzsche now wanted to pour into the new Europe he envisioned. He therefore expects urged the Jews to become secularized, to mix with other Europeans, to excel in all European affairs and eventually set new standards and values to them. The Jew's existential vigor and anti-Christian disposition would then pour into Europe, promoting a Dionysian revolution of values. Unlike Hegel, then, Nietzsche treats the Jews as an ethnic, historical human group and not primarily a religion.\n\nThis book, published in Hebrew in 1996 and translated into English, French, Japanese, and Rumanian, also shows that universal reason does not necessarily exclude a strong anti-Jewish bias, and a philosophy of power must not necessarily be anti-Semitic.\n\nFollowing his interest in Spinoza, Yovel was intrigued by the broader phenomenon of the Marranos and studied it for its own sake. The result was another opus: \"The Other Within: The Marranos: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity\" (Princeton 2009).\nYovel describes the Marranos as \"the other within\"—people who both did and did not belong. Rejected by most Jews as renegades and by most veteran Christians as Jews with impure blood, Marranos had no definite, integral identity, Yovel argues. The \"Judaizers\"-Marranos who wished to remain secretly Jewish - were not actually Jews, and those Marranos who wished to assimilate were not truly integrated as Hispano-Catholics. Rather, mixing Jewish and Christian symbols and life patterns, Marranos were typically distinguished by a split identity. They also discovered the subjective mind, engaged in social and religious dissent, and demonstrated early signs of secularity and this-worldliness. In these ways, Yovel says, the Marranos anticipated many central features of Western modernity, and also of the modern Jewish experience.\n\nHistorians who see their work as constructive of the national identity tend to appropriate the Marranos (or, Conversos) exclusively to their own nation and culture. Yovel's book argues it is impossible to attribute any integral and univocal identity to the Marranos, neither Jewish nor Hispano-Catholic, since it was, precisely, the disintegration of the compact characteristic of medieval society which is the most distinctive and interesting feature of these people, and one of the main contributions they made to early-modern Europe.\n\nOne of this book's philosophical conclusions is that the split identity which the Inquisition persecuted and modern nationalism condemns as illicit, is a genuine and inevitable shape of human existence, which deserves recognition as a basic human freedom.\n\n"}

Dahui was a famous popularizer of \"kōan\"s during the Song Dynasty in China. Dahui's collection is composed of three scrolls prefaced by three short introductory pieces. Dahui's work uses the same Chinese characters for its title as the now well known Shōbōgenzō written by the Japanese monk Eihei Dōgen in the thirteenth century. Upon arriving in China, Dōgen first studied under Wuji Lepai, a disciple of Dahui, which is where he probably came into contact with Dahui's \"Zhengfa Yanzang\". In his book \"Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation\", the modern scholar Carl Bielefeldt acknowledges that Dōgen likely took the title from Dahui for his own \"kōan\" collection, the Shinji Shōbōgenzō, and kept it for his later and now most well-known work, the Kana Shōbōgenzō (usually referred to simply as \"the Shōbōgenzō\"): Indeed the fact that Dōgen styled his effort \"Shōbō genzō\" suggests that he had as his model a similar compilation of the same title by the most famous of Sung masters, Ta-Hui Tsung-kao [Dahui Zonggao]. Unlike the latter, Dōgen was content here simply to record the stories without interjecting his own remarks. A few years later, however, he embarked on a major project to develop extended commentaries on many of these and other passages from the Ch'an literature. The fruit of this project was his masterpiece—the remarkable collection of essays known as the kana, or \"vernacular\", Shōbō genzō.\n\n"}
