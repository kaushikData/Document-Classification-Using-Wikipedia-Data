When Aaron was 18, his eldest brother Yehuda was killed in the Six-Day War, at the age of 32. Aaron is married to Ruth with two sons, Dean and Adam.\n\nBen-Ze'ev received his B.A. in Philosophy and Economics (1975) and his M.A. in Philosophy (1977), both from the University of Haifa. He was awarded his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago (1981).). His doctoral thesis was entitled \"Perception as a Cognitive System\"; his doctoral studies advisor was Stephen Toulmin; Alan Gewirth, Robert Richards, and William Wimsatt served on the doctoral committee. (his M.A. thesis advisor) and Stephen Toulmin have greatly influenced his philosophical views. Their thinking is marked by a unique combination of a broad outlook on the very profound issues of philosophy (and life), a careful analysis of the details, and the ability to concretize their discussion in everyday issues. Despite such similarity, they came from different backgrounds: While Strauss, like his grandfather Martin Buber, was submersed in the German tradition and his important writings are in German and Hebrew, Toulmin, a pupil of Ludwig Wittgenstein, grew up within the English analytic tradition.\n\nThe philosophers whose writings have made the greatest impact upon Ben-Ze'ev are Aristotle, Baruch Spinoza and Immanuel Kant. Kant’s main influence is most evident in Ben Ze'ev's discussions on epistemology and perception. Aristotle’s and Spinoza’s impact is more apparent in his discussions of the mind–body problem and in his work on the emotions.\n\nBen-Ze'ev's major books are \"The Perceptual System\" (Peter Lang, 1993); \"The Subtlety of Emotions\" (MIT UP, 2000); \"Love Online: Emotions on the Internet\" (Cambridge UP, 2004); \"In The Name of Love: Romantic Ideology and its Victims\" (with Ruhama Goussinsky, Oxford UP, 2008); \"Die Logik der Gefühle: Kritik der emotionalen Intelligenz\" (Suhrkamp, 2009).\n\nBen-Ze'ev has held several academic positions at the University of Haifa, including: President (2004–2012); Rector (2000–2004); Dean of Research (1995-2000); Philosophy Department Chairperson (1986–1988); Chairperson of the Humanity Division, Oranim-School of Education (1991–1994); Chairperson of the Association of University Heads, Israel; Head of the University of Haifa Press; and Head of the Academic Channel. He established the Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Emotions at the University of Haifa. He is currently the President of the newly established European Philosophical Society for the Study of Emotions.\n\nIn his various writings on perception (in particular, \"The Perceptual System\"), Ben-Ze'ev rejects the indirect view of perception and argues for the presence of direct, non-pure perception. He rejects naïve realism as well as extreme subjectivism, and argues for a critical realism. Such realism considers perceptual qualities as properties of the perceptual environment, which is a relational environment that presupposes the existence of a perceiver. Within the perceptual environment, perception is direct, as it involves direct awareness of events in the environment, but in light of the relational nature of this environment, perceptual awareness merely provides partial information about the world—that part which is influenced by the subject’s characteristics. In his view, perception is direct in two major senses: it is perception of the objects themselves, not of internal mental representations, and it is not preceded by mediating inferential processes. Ben-Ze'ev's book \"The Perceptual System\" received an excellent review in \"The Review of Metaphysics\", with the reviewer, Jack Ornstein, stating that Ben-Ze'ev's view is “the only remotely plausible approach” to the mind–body problem: “Finally, we have a theory of perception and the mind which any scientifically-minded, critical philosopher can live with.” Together with his work on perception, Ben-Ze'ev has pursued related issues in the philosophy of psychology, such as the body–mind problem and memory, and has written on various philosophers, in particular Aristotle and Thomas Reid.\n\nFive years after finishing his Ph.D. thesis, Ben-Ze'ev began to study the emotions, a topic that remains at the center of his research today. In this field he was particularly influenced by Aristotle (mainly his analysis of emotions as evaluative attitudes) and by Spinoza (in particular, his emphasis on the importance of change in generating emotions). The psychological work that has most influenced his thinking has been \"The Cognitive Structure of Emotions\" (1988) by Ortony, Clore and Collins. Ben-Ze'ev has published many articles in this field, as well as several books: \"The Subtlety of Emotions\" (MIT 2000), \"Love Online: Emotions on the Internet\" (Cambridge 2004)), In \"the Name of Love: Romantic Ideology and its Victims\" (Oxford: 2008; written with Ruhama Goussinsky), and \"Die Logik der Gefühle: Kritik der emotionalen Intelligenz\" (Suhrkamp, 2009).\n\n"}

He is Professor of Philosophy and Edmund N. Carpenter, II Class of 1943 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University, where he has taught since 1990, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. He works on Greek philosophy, aesthetics, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, and literary theory.\n\nNehamas was born in Athens, Greece in 1946. In 1964, he enrolled to Swarthmore College. He graduated in 1967 and completed his doctorate (titled \"Predication and the Theory of Forms in the 'Phaedo\"') under the direction of Gregory Vlastos at Princeton University in 1971. He taught at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pennsylvania before joining the Princeton faculty in 1990.\n\nHis early work was on Platonic metaphysics and aesthetics as well as the philosophy of Socrates, but he gained a wider audience with his 1985 book \"Nietzsche: Life as Literature\" (Harvard University Press), in which he argued that Nietzsche thought of life and the world on the model of a literary text. Nehamas has said, \"The virtues of life are comparable to the virtues of good writing—style, connectedness, grace, elegance—and also, we must not forget, sometimes getting it right.\" More recently, he has become well known for his view that philosophy should provide a form of life, as well as for his endorsement of the artistic value of television. This view also becomes evident in his book \"Only a Promise of Happiness\". The title itself is later in this work used as one definition of beauty with reference to Stendhal. In that sense, beauty can be found in all media; as Nehamas claims in the same work: \"Aesthetic features are everywhere, but that has nothing to do with where the arts can be found. Works of art can be beautiful because everything can be beautiful, but that doesn't mean that anything can be a work of art.\"\n\nIn 2016, Nehamas published a book, \"On Friendship\", based on his 2008 Gifford Lectures. In it, he argues, contra Aristotle, that friendship is an aesthetic, but not always moral, good. And—like in his earlier work, \"Only a Promise of Happiness\"—he compares friends to artworks. “Like metaphors and works of art, the people who matter to us are all, so far as we are concerned, inexhaustible. They always remain a step beyond the furthest point our knowledge of them has reached—though only if, and as long as, they still matter to us.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "767533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=767533", "title": "Alexandre Kojève", "text": "Alexandre Kojève\n\nAlexandre Kojève (; ; 28 April 1902 – 4 June 1968) was a Russian-born French philosopher and statesman whose philosophical seminars had an immense influence on 20th-century French philosophy, particularly via his integration of Hegelian concepts into twentieth-century continental philosophy.\nAs a statesman in the French government, he was instrumental in the formation of the European Union. Kojève was a close friend of, and was in lifelong philosophical dialogue with, Leo Strauss.\n\nKojève was born Aleksandr Vladimirovič Koževnikov () in Russia to a wealthy and influential family. His uncle was the abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky, about whose work he would write an influential essay in 1936. He was educated at the University of Berlin and Heidelberg, Germany. In Heidelberg he completed in 1926 his PhD thesis on the Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Soloviev's views on the union of God and man in Christ under the direction of Karl Jaspers. The title of his thesis was \"Die religiöse Philosophie Wladimir Solowjews\" (\"The Religious Philosophy of Vladimir Soloviev\").\n\nEarly influences included the philosopher Martin Heidegger and the historian of science Alexandre Koyré. Kojève spent most of his life in France, and from 1933 to 1939, he delivered in Paris a series of lectures on Georg Hegel's work \"Phenomenology of Spirit\". After World War II, Kojève worked in the French Ministry of Economic Affairs as one of the chief planners of the European Common Market.\n\nKojève was an extraordinarily learned man. A polyglot, he studied and used Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Latin, and Classical Greek. He was also fluent in French, German, Russian, and English.\n\nKojève died in Brussels in 1968, shortly after giving a talk at the European Economic Community (now the European Union) on behalf of the French government. In his later years, he had repeatedly expressed the position that what Marx called the European proletariat no longer existed, and the wealthy West sorely needed to help developing countries to overcome widespread poverty through large monetary gifts similar to the Marshall Plan.\n\nThough not an orthodox Marxist, Kojeve was known as an influential and idiosyncratic interpreter of Hegel, reading him through the lens of both Marx and Heidegger. The well-known \"End of History\" thesis advanced the idea that ideological history in a limited sense had ended with the French Revolution and the regime of Napoleon and that there was no longer a need for violent struggle to establish the \"rational supremacy of the regime of rights and equal recognition.\" Kojeve's \"End of History\" is different from Francis Fukuyama's later thesis of the same name in that it points as much to a socialist-capitalist synthesis as to a triumph of liberal capitalism. Mark Lilla notes that Kojève rejected the prevailing concept among European intellectuals of the 1930s that capitalism and democracy were failed artifacts of the Enlightenment that would be destroyed by either communism or fascism. In contrast, Kojève, while initially somewhat more sympathetic to the Soviet Union than the United States, devoted much of his thought to protecting western European autonomy, particularly so France, from domination by either the Soviet Union and the United States. He believed that the capitalist United States represented Right-Hegelianism while the state-socialist Soviet Union represented Left-Hegelianism; victory by either side, he posited, would result in what Lilla describes as \"a rationally organized bureaucracy without class distinctions.\"\n\nSome of Kojève's more important lectures on Hegel have been published in English in the now classic \"Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit\", in 1947. His interpretation of Hegel has been one of the most influential of the past century. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, André Breton, Jacques Lacan, Raymond Aron, Roger Caillois, Michel Leiris, Henry Corbin, Jean Hyppolite, and Éric Weil. His interpretation of the master–slave dialectic was an important influence on Jacques Lacan's mirror stage theory. Other French thinkers who have acknowledged his influence on their thought include the post-structuralist philosophers Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.\n\nKojeve's correspondence with Leo Strauss has been published along with Kojève's critique of Strauss's commentary on Xenophon's \"Hiero\" (see below on their friendship and debate). In the 1950s, Kojève also met the rightist legal theorist Carl Schmitt, whose \"Concept of the Political\" he had implicitly criticized in his analysis of Hegel's text on \"Lordship and Bondage.\" Another close friend was the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher Gaston Fessard.\n\nIn addition to his lectures on the \"Phenomenology of Spirit,\" Kojève's other publications include a little noticed book on Immanuel Kant, and articles on the relationship between Hegelian and Marxist thought and Christianity. His 1943 book, \"Esquisse d'une phenomenologie du droit\", published posthumously in 1981, contrasts the aristocratic and bourgeois views of the right. \"Le Concept, le temps et le discours,\" extrapolates on the Hegelian notion that wisdom only becomes possible in the fullness of time. Kojève's response to Leo Strauss, who disputed this notion, can be found in Kojève's article \"The Emperor Julian and his Art of Writing\".\n\nKojève also challenged Strauss' interpretation of the classics in the voluminous \"Esquisse d'une histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne,\" which covers the pre-Socratic philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, and Neoplatonism. Recently, three more books have been published: a 1932 thesis on the physical and philosophical importance of quantum physics, an extended 1931 essay on atheism (\"L'athéisme\"), and a 1943 work on \"The Notion of Authority.\"\n\nKojève had a close and lifelong friendship with Leo Strauss which began when they were philosophy students in Berlin. The two shared a deep philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that he \"never would have known [...] what philosophy is\" without Strauss. In the 1930s the two began a debate on the relation of philosophy to politics that would come to fruition with Kojeve's response to Strauss' \"On Tyranny\". Kojève, a senior statesman in the French government, argued that philosophers should have an active part in shaping political events. Strauss, on the other hand, believed that philosophy and politics were fundamentally opposed, and that philosophers should not have a substantial role in politics, noting the disastrous results of Plato in Syracuse. Philosophers should influence politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophical contemplation remains free from the seduction and coercion of power. In spite of this debate, Strauss and Kojève remained friendly. In fact, Strauss would send his best students to Paris to finish their education under Kojève's personal guidance. Among these were Allan Bloom, who endeavored to make Kojève's works available in English (and published the first edition of Kojève's lectures in English), and Stanley Rosen.\n\nIn 1999, \"Le Monde\" published an article reporting that a French intelligence document showed that Kojève had spied for the Soviets for over thirty years. The claims of this document (and even its existence) are disputed, and it has never been released. Kojève's supporters tend to believe that if it were true, it was probably unsubstantial as spying per se and a result of his megalomaniacal personality, a pretense to be a philosopher at the end of history influencing the course of world events.\n\nIn any case, Kojève's contribution to international French economic policy was more than substantial. Though Kojève often claimed to be a Stalinist, he largely regarded the Soviet Union with contempt, calling its social policies disastrous and its claims to be a truly classless state ludicrous. (Kojève's cynicism towards traditional Marxism as an outmoded philosophy in industrially well-developed capitalist nations prompted him to go as far as idiosyncratically referring to capitalist Henry Ford as \"the one great authentic Marxist of the twentieth century.\") He specifically and repeatedly called it the only existing country in which 19th-century capitalism still existed. His \"Stalinism\" was ironic to the extent Stalin had no political chance to lead the Weltgeist; yet, he was serious about Stalinism to the extent that he regarded the utopia of the Soviet Union under Stalin, and the willingness to purge unsupportive elements in the population, as evidence of a desire to bring about the end of history, and as a repetition of the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution.\n\nIn a commentary on Francis Fukuyama's \"The End of History and the Last Man\", Roger Scruton calls Kojève \"a life-hating Russian at heart, a self-declared Stalinist, and a civil servant who played a leading behind-the-scenes role in establishing both the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European Economic Community\" and states the opinion that Kojève was \"a dangerous psychopath.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11833883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11833883", "title": "Apple (symbolism)", "text": "Apple (symbolism)\n\nApples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that as late as the 17th century, the word \"apple\" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts. This term may even have extended to plant galls, as they were thought to be of plant origin (see oak apple). For instance, when tomatoes were introduced into Europe, they were called \"love apples\". In one Old English work, cucumbers are called \"eorþæppla\" (lit. \"earth-apples'), just as in French, Dutch, Hebrew, Afrikaans, Persian and Swiss German as well as several other German dialects, the words for potatoes mean \"earth-apples\". In some languages, oranges are called \"golden apples\" or \"Chinese apples\". Datura is called 'thorn-apple\".\n\nEthnobotanical and ethnomycological scholars such as R. Gordon Wasson, Carl Ruck and Clark Heinrich write that the mythological apple is a symbolic substitution for the entheogenic Amanita muscaria (or fly agaric) mushroom. Its association with knowledge is an allusion to the revelatory states described by some shamans and users of psychedelic mushrooms. At times artists would co-opt the apple, as well as other religious symbology, whether for ironic effect or as a stock element of symbolic vocabulary. Thus, secular art as well made use of the apple as symbol of love and sexuality. It is often an attribute associated with Venus who is shown holding it.\n\nThough the forbidden fruit in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition holds that Adam and Eve ate an apple from the forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden. The unnamed fruit of Eden thus became an apple under the influence of the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man and sin.\n\nThe classical Greek word μήλον (mēlon), or dialectal μᾶλον (mālon), now a loanword in English as melon, meant tree fruit in general, but was borrowed into Latin as \"\", meaning 'apple'. The similarity of this word to Latin (\"\") , meaning 'evil', may also have influenced the apple's becoming interpreted as the biblical 'forbidden fruit' in the commonly used Latin translation called \"Vulgate\". The larynx in the human throat has been called Adam's apple because of the folk tale that the bulge was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in the throat of Adam. The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has sometimes been used to imply sexuality between men, possibly in an ironic vein.\nThe notion of the apple as a symbol of sin is reflected in artistic renderings of the fall from Eden. When held in Adam's hand, the apple symbolises sin. But, when Christ is portrayed holding an apple, he represents the Second Adam who brings life. This difference reflects the evolution of the symbol in Christianity. In the Old Testament, the apple was significant of the fall of man; in the New Testament, it is an emblem of the redemption from that fall. The apple is represented in pictures of the Madonna and Infant Jesus as another sign of that redemption.\n\nIn some versions (such as Young's Literal Translation) of the Bible, the Hebrew word for mandrakes \"dudaim\" (Genesis 30:14) is translated as \"love apples\" (not to be confused with the New World tomatoes). There are several instances in the Old Testament where the apple is used in a more favourable light. The phrase 'the apple of your eye' comes from verses in Deuteronomy 32:10, Psalm 17:8 Proverbs 7:2, and Zechariah 2:8, implying an object or person who is greatly valued. In Proverbs 25:11, the verse states, \"a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver\". In the love songs of the Song of Solomon, the apple is used in a sensual context. In these latter instances, the apple is used as a symbol for beauty. The apple appears again in Joel 1:12 in a verse with a sense of profound loss when the apple tree withers.\nDuring the Jewish New Year - Rosh Hashanah - it is customary to eat apples dipped in honey to evoke a \"new year that is good [the apple] and sweet [the honey]\".\n\nIt is a long-standing tradition in many tribal communities that the first born child of any couple shall be presented with an apple randomly picked from a tree by their paternal grandparents on the day of their birth. If the chosen apple is sliced \nopen and revealed to have a worm inside, it is a bad omen and on their 21st birthday, the child must perform a dance to the fruit gods \nto spare the lives of their own offspring.\n\nThe Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center.\n\nAtalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (a.k.a. Melanion, a name possibly derived from \"melon\" the Greek word for both \"apple\" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.\n\nThe Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Kallisti ('For the most beautiful one'), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn was the appointed keeper of golden apples that kept the Æsir young (or immortal) forever. Iðunn was abducted by Þjazi the giant, who used Loki to lure Iðunn and her apples out of Ásgarðr. The Æsir began to age without Iðunn's apples, so they coerced Loki into rescuing her. After borrowing Freyja's falcon skin, Loki liberated Iðunn from Þjazi by transforming her into a nut for the flight back. Þjazi gave chase in the form of an eagle, whereupon reaching Ásgarðr he was set aflame by a bonfire lit by the Æsir. With the return of Iðunn's apples, the Æsir regained their lost youth. Apple trees were the symbol of rebirth and beauty; the apple tree was sacred in Norse mythology.\n\nAllantide (, meaning \"first day of winter\") is a Cornish festival that was traditionally celebrated on the night of 31 October, as well as the following day time. One of the most important parts of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast. and in the town of St Just it surpassed Christmas as a time for giving gifts until the late 20th century. A game was also recorded in which two pieces of wood were nailed together in the shape of a cross. It was then suspended, with 4 lit candles on each arm and Allan apples suspended underneath. The aim being to catch the apples with your mouth without getting molten wax on your face. For unmarried recipients the apples would be placed under their pillows in the hope that they would bring dreams of their future wife or husband.\n\n\n"}

It was established by Wilhelm Abraham Teller. Members included the Prussian finance minister Carl August von Struensee, the finance councillor Johann Heinrich Wloemer (1726–1797), the poet Leopold Friedrich Günther von Goeckingk, Christian Konrad Wilhelm von Dohm, the theatre director and writer Johann Jacob Engel, the Supreme Court councillor Friedrich Wilhelm von Beneke, Friedrich Gedike, Karl Franz von Irwing, the jurist Ernst Ferdinand Klein, Franz Michael Leuchsenring, the physician Johann Carl Wilhelm Moehsen und Christian Gottlieb Selle, the preachers Johann Joachim Spalding and Johann Friedrich Zöllner, and Karl Gottlieb Suarez. Moses Mendelssohn was an honorary member.\n\nIt was through this scholarly semi-secret society, as well as through the longer-lived Montagsclub, which had a more social character, that the Berlin Enlightenment spread its ideas, using the \"Berlinische Monatsschrift\" as an outlet. Nearly every member wrote in this paper, and Werner Krauss, in his studies of the period, called it the movement's most important forum.\n\nIn 1798, Frederick William III of Prussia closed down the society as a threat to public order.\n\nWith the short-lived \"Berliner Blätter\" and \"Neue Berlinische Monatsschrift\" (which lasted until 1811), Biester continued to promote their ideas, the enthusiasm for which philosophical Idealism had threatened to quench; but the standards of previous years (when Kant had made contributions) were never quite matched, and Biester died in 1816, with no-one left to replace him.\n\n"}

{"id": "1923060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923060", "title": "Buddhism in Vietnam", "text": "Buddhism in Vietnam\n\nBuddhism in Vietnam (\"Đạo Phật\" or \"Phật Giáo\" in Vietnamese), as practised by the ethnic Vietnamese, is mainly of the Mahayana tradition. Buddhism may have first come to Vietnam as early as the 3rd or 2nd century BCE from South Asia or from China in the 1st or 2nd century CE. Vietnamese Buddhism has had a syncretic relationship with certain elements of Taoism, Chinese spirituality and the Vietnamese folk religion.\n\nThere are conflicting theories regarding whether Buddhism first reached Vietnam during the 3rd or 2nd century BCE via delegations from India, or during the 1st or 2nd century from China. In either case, by the end of the second century CE, Vietnam had developed into a major regional Mahayana Buddhist center centering on Luy Lâu in modern Bắc Ninh Province, northeast of the present day capital city of Hanoi. Luy Lâu was the capital of the Han region of Jiaozhi and was a popular place visited by many Indian Buddhist missionary monks en route to China. The monks followed the maritime trade route from the Indian sub-continent to China used by Indian traders. A number of Mahayana sutras and the āgamas were translated into Classical Chinese there, including the \"Sutra of Forty-two Chapters\" and the \"Anapanasati\".\n\nJiaozhi was the birthplace of Buddhist missionary Kang Senghui who was of Sogdian origin.\n\nOver the next eighteen centuries, Vietnam and China shared many common features of cultural, philosophical and religious heritage. This was due to geographical proximity to one another and Vietnam being annexed twice by China. Vietnamese Buddhism is thus related to Chinese Buddhism in general, and to some extent reflects the formation of Chinese Buddhism after the Song dynasty. Theravada Buddhism, on the other hand, would become incorporated through the southern annexation of Khmer people and territories.\n\nDuring the Đinh dynasty (968-980), Buddhism was recognized by the state as an official faith (~971), reflecting the high esteem of Buddhist faith held by the Vietnamese monarchs. The Early Lê dynasty (980-1009) also afforded the same recognition to the Buddhist church. The growth of Buddhism during this time is attributed to the recruitment of erudite monks to the court as the newly independent state needed an ideological basis on which to build a country. Subsequently, this role was ceded to Confucianism.\n\nVietnamese Buddhism reached its zenith during the Lý dynasty (1009–1225) beginning with the founder Lý Thái Tổ, who was raised in a pagoda. All of the kings during the Lý dynasty professed and sanctioned Buddhism as the state religion. This endured with the Trần dynasty (1225–1400) but Buddhism had to share the stage with the emerging growth of Confucianism.\n\nBy the 15th century, Buddhism fell out of favor with the court during the Later Lê dynasty, although still popular with the masses. Officials like Lê Quát attacked it as heretical and wasteful. It was not until the 19th century that Buddhism regained some stature under the Nguyễn dynasty who accorded royal support.\n\nA Buddhist revival movement (Chấn hưng Phật giáo) emerged in the 1920s in an effort to reform and strengthen institutional Buddhism, which had lost grounds to the spread of Christianity and the growth of other faiths under French rule. The movement continued into the 1950s.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam. In a country where surveys of the religious composition estimated the Buddhist majority to be approximately 50 to 70 percent, President Ngô Đình Diệm's policies generated claims of religious bias. As a member of the Catholic Vietnamese minority, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists.\nIn May 1963, in the central city of Huế, where Diệm's elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the archbishop, Buddhists were prohibited from displaying Buddhist flags during Vesak celebrations yet few days earlier, Catholics were allowed to fly religious flags at a celebration in honour of the newly seated archbishop. This led to widespread protest against the government; troops were sent in and nine civilians were killed in the confrontations. This led to mass rallies against Diệm's government, termed as the Buddhist crisis. The conflicts culminated in Thích Quảng Đức's self-immolation. President Diệm's younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu favored strong-armed tactics and Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces engaged in the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids, killing estimated hundreds. Dismayed by the public outrage, the US government withdrew support for the regime. President Diệm was deposed and killed in the 1963 coup.\n\nPolitical strength of the Buddhists grew in the 1960s as the different schools and orders convene to form the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. Leaders of the Church like Thích Trí Quang had considerable sway in national politics, at times challenging the government.\n\nWith the fall of Saigon in 1975, the whole nation came under Communist rule; many religious practices including Buddhism were discouraged.In the North the government had created the United Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, co-opting the clergy to function under government auspices but in the South, the Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam still held sway and openly challenged the communist government. The Sangha leadership was thus arrested and imprisoned; Sangha properties were seized and the Sangha itself was outlawed. In its place was the newly created Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, designed as the final union of all Buddhist organizations, now under full state control. \nSince Đổi Mới (1986) many reforms have allowed Buddhism to be practiced relatively unhindered by the individuals. However no organized sangha is allowed to function independent of the state. It was not until 2007 that Pure Land Buddhism, the most widespread type of Buddhism practiced in Vietnam, was officially recognized as a religion by the government. Thích Quảng Độ the Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Sangha, once imprisoned, remains under surveillance and restricted in his travels.\n\nToday, Buddhists are found throughout in Vietnam, from North to South. Buddhism is the single largest organized religion in Vietnam, with somewhere between 9% and 16% of the population identifying themselves as Buddhist.\n\nAfter the fall of South Vietnam to communism in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, the first major Buddhist community appeared in North America. Since this time, the North American Vietnamese Buddhist community has grown to some 160 temples and centers. Proselytizing is not a priority.\n\nThe most famous practitioner of synchronized Vietnamese Thiền in the West is Thích Nhất Hạnh who has authored dozens of books and founded the Dharma center Plum Village in France together with his colleague, bhikṣuṇī and Zen Master Chân Không. According to Nguyen and Barber, Thích Nhất Hạnh's fame in the Western world as a proponent of engaged Buddhism and a new Thiền style has \"no affinity with or any foundation in traditional Vietnamese Buddhist practices\" and according to Alexander Soucy (2007) his style of Zen Buddhism is not reflective of actual Vietnamese Buddhism. Thích Nhất Hạnh often recounts about his early Thiền practices in Vietnam in his Dharma talks saying that he continued and developed this practice in the West which has a distinctive Vietnamese Thiền flavor.\n\nThích Nhất Hạnh's Buddhist teachings have started to return to a Vietnam where the Buddhist landscape is now being shaped by the combined Vietnamese and Westernized Buddhism that is focused more on the meditative practices.\n\nFollowers in Vietnam practice differing traditions without any problem or sense of contradiction. Few Vietnamese Buddhists would identify themselves as a particular kind of Buddhism, as a Christian might identify him or herself by a denomination, for example. Although Vietnamese Buddhism does not have a strong centralized structure, the practice is similar throughout the country at almost any temple.\n\nGaining merit is the most common and essential practice in Vietnamese Buddhism with a belief that liberation takes place with the help of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Buddhist monks commonly chant sutras, recite Buddhas’ names (particularly Amitābha), doing repentance and praying for rebirth in the Pure Land.\n\nThe \"Lotus Sutra\" and the \"Amitabha Sutra\" are the most commonly used sutras. Most sutras and texts are in Classical Chinese and are merely recited with Sino-Xenic pronunciations, making them incomprehensible to most practitioners.\n\nThree services are practiced regularly at dawn, noon, and dusk. They include sutra reading with niệm Phật and dhāraṇī recitation and kinh hành (walking meditation). Laypeople at times join the services at the temple and some devout Buddhist practice the services at home. Special services such as Sam Nguyen/Sam Hoi (confession/repentance) takes place on the full moon and new moon each month. Niệm Phật practice is one way of repenting and purifying bad karma.\n\nBuddhist temples also serve a significant role in death rituals and funerals among overseas Vietnamese.\n\nThe overall doctrinal position of Vietnamese Buddhism is the inclusive system of Tiantai, with the higher metaphysics informed by the Huayan school (); however, the orientation of Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic without making such distinctions. Therefore, modern practice of Vietnamese Buddhism can be very eclectic, including elements from \"Thiền\" (Chan Buddhism), \"Thiên Thai\" (Tiantai), \"Tịnh độ\" Pure Land Buddhism, and popular practices from Vajrayana. According to Charles Prebish, many English language sources contain misconceptions regarding the variety of doctrines and practices in traditional Vietnamese Buddhism:\n\nThe methods of Pure Land Buddhism are perhaps the most widespread within Vietnam. It is common for practitioners to recite sutras, chants and dhāraṇīs looking to gain protection through bodhisattvas or dharmapalas. It is a devotional practice where those practicing put their faith in Amitābha (). Followers believe they will gain rebirth in his pure land by chanting Amitabha's name. A pure land is a Buddha-realm where one can more easily attain enlightenment since suffering does not exist there.\n\nMany religious organizations have not been recognized by the government; however, in 2007, with 1.5 million followers, the Vietnamese Pure Land Buddhism Association (Tịnh Độ Cư Sĩ Phật Hội Việt Nam) received official recognition as an independent and legal religious organization.\n\nThiền is the Sino-Xenic pronunciation of \"Chan\" (Japanese \"Zen\") and is derived ultimately from Sanskrit \"dhyāna\". The traditional account is that in 580, an Indian monk named Vinitaruci () traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chan Buddhism. This would be the first appearance of Thiền. The sect that Vinitaruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thiền. After a period of obscurity, the Vinitaruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly under the patriarch Vạn-Hạnh (died 1018). Other early Vietnamese Zen schools included the Vô Ngôn Thông, which was associated with the teaching of Mazu Daoyi, and the Thảo Đường, which incorporated nianfo chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.\n\nA new Thiền school was founded by King Trần Nhân Tông (1258–1308); called the Trúc Lâm \"Bamboo Grove\" school, it evinced a deep influence from Confucian and Taoist philosophy. Nevertheless, Trúc Lâm's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court. In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguyên Thiều introduced the Ling school (Lâm Tế). A more native offshoot of Lâm Tế, the Liễu Quán school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Zen.\nSome scholars argue that the importance and prevalence of Thiền in Vietnam has been greatly overstated and that it has played more of an elite rhetorical role than a role of practice. The \"Thiền uyển tập anh\" (, \"Collection of Outstanding Figures of the Zen Garden\") has been the dominant text used to legitimize Thiền lineages and history within Vietnam. However, Cuong Tu Nguyen's \"Zen in Medieval Vietnam: A Study and Translation of the Thien Tap Anh\" (1997) gives a critical review of how the text has been used to create a history of Zen Buddhism that is \"fraught with discontinuity\". Modern Buddhist practices are not reflective of a Thiền past; in Vietnam, common practices are more focused on ritual and devotion than the Thiền focus on meditation. Nonetheless, Vietnam is seeing a steady growth in Zen today. Two figures who have been responsible for this increased interest in Thiền are Thích Nhất Hạnh, currently residing in France, and Thích Thanh Từ, who lives in Da Lat.\n\nThe central and southern part of present-day Vietnam were originally inhabited by the Chams and the Khmer people, respectively, who followed both a syncretic Śaiva-Mahayana (see History of Buddhism in Cambodia) and Theravada Buddhism. Đại Việt annexed the land occupied by the Cham during conquests in the 15th century and by the 18th century had also annexed the southern portion of the Khmer Empire, resulting in the current borders of Vietnam. From that time onward, the dominant Đại Việt (Vietnamese) followed the Mahayana tradition while the Khmer continued to practice Theravada.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, there were a number of movements in Vietnam for the revival and modernization of Buddhist activities. Together with the re-organization of Mahayana establishments, there developed a growing interest in Theravadin meditation as well as the Pāli Canon. These were then available in French. Among the pioneers who brought Theravada Buddhism to the ethnic Đại Việt was a young veterinary doctor named Lê Văn Giảng. He was born in the South, received higher education in Hanoi, and after graduation, was sent to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to work for the French government.\n\nDuring that time he became especially interested in Theravada Buddhist practice. Subsequently, he decided to ordain and took the Dhamma name of Hộ-Tông (Vansarakkhita). In 1940, upon an invitation from a group of lay Buddhists led by Nguyễn Văn Hiểu, he went back to Vietnam in order to help establish the first Theravada temple for Vietnamese Buddhists at Gò Dưa, Thủ Đức (now a district of Hồ Chí Minh City). The temple was named Bửu Quang (Ratana Ramsyarama). The temple was destroyed by French troops in 1947, and was later rebuilt in 1951. At Bửu Quang temple, together with a group of Vietnamese bhikkhus who had received training in Cambodia such as Thiện Luật, Bửu Chơn, Kim Quang and Giới Nghiêm, Hộ Tông began teaching Buddhism in their native Vietnamese. He also translated many Buddhist materials from the Pali Canon, and Theravada became part of Vietnamese Buddhist activity in the country.\n\nIn 1949–1950, Hộ Tông together with Nguyễn Văn Hiểu and supporters built a new temple in Saigon (now Hồ Chí Minh City), named Kỳ Viên Tự (\"Jetavana Vihara\"). This temple became the centre of Theravada activities in Vietnam, which continued to attract increasing interest among the Vietnamese Buddhists. In 1957, the Vietnamese Theravada Buddhist Sangha Congregation (Giáo Hội Tăng Già Nguyên Thủy Việt Nam) was formally established and recognised by the government, and the Theravada Sangha elected Venerable Hộ Tông as its first President, or Sangharaja.\n\nFrom Saigon, the Theravada movement spread to other provinces, and soon, a number of Theravada temples for ethnic Viet Buddhists were established in many areas in the South and Central parts of Vietnam. There are 529 Theravada temples throughout the country, of which 19 were located in Hồ Chí Minh City and its vicinity. Besides Bửu Quang and Kỳ Viên temples, other well known temples are Bửu Long, Giác Quang, Tam Bảo (Đà Nẵng), Thiền Lâm and Huyền Không (Huế), and the large Thích Ca Phật Đài in Vũng Tàu.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12204580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12204580", "title": "David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)", "text": "David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)\n\nDavid M. Rosenthal is a philosopher at the City University of New York (CUNY) who has made significant contributions to the philosophy of mind, particularly in the area of consciousness. He was educated at the University of Chicago and then Princeton University. In addition to philosophy of mind, Rosenthal has research interests in the related field of cognitive science and is Coordinator of the CUNY Graduate Center's Interdisciplinary Concentration in Cognitive Science. Rosenthal has also done work in philosophy of language, metaphysics, ancient philosophy, and 17th-Century rationalism.\n\nRosenthal is best known for his higher-order-thought (HOT) theory of consciousness. He argues that no mental state is conscious if one is not aware of that state; so a mental state is conscious only if one is aware of oneself as being in that state. And he argues that we are aware of mental states that are conscious by having a thought that one is in that state. These higher-order thoughts are seldom conscious thoughts, and they are distinct from the states they are about. The standard mark in everyday contexts and in experimental psychology that distinguishes conscious mental states is that an individual can report the state; we are unable to report mental states that aren't conscious. Rosenthal argues that it's the higher-order thoughts that accompany conscious states that enable us to make such reports; because we have no such higher-order awareness of mental states that aren't conscious, we can't report them. Rosenthal has also argued that the higher-order-thought theory fits well with recent findings in psychology and neuropsychology (Lau and Rosenthal 2011).\n\nSince mental states are conscious only if one is aware of those states, every mental state can occur without being conscious. That includes states that exhibit mental qualities, such as the perceptions and bodily sensations that occur in subliminal perception and in blindsight. This view goes against many contemporary views, on which mental qualities are tied inextricably to consciousness. So Rosenthal has developed a \"quality-space theory\" (also \"homomorphism theory\") of the mental qualities, which explains what qualitative mental states without appeal to consciousness. All mental qualities are individuated by their positions in a quality space that pertains to their sensory modality. More specifically, we can define a quality space of the physical perceptible properties that mental qualities enable access to, relying just on the ability to discriminate among those perceptible properties. Mental qualities, then, are the properties of mental states that make that discriminative capacity possible; so they are fixed by the positions they occupy in a quality space corresponding to the quality space of accessed perceptible properties. Because the quality spaces of perceptible properties are determined solely by the ability to discriminate among sample properties, independently of whether the perceptual states are conscious, mental qualities themselves can occur without being conscious. They occur consciously only when one is aware of oneself as being in the relevant qualitative state, on the HOT theory, when one has the relevant HOT.\n\nRosenthal's HOT theory of consciousness resembles in some ways the traditional inner-sense theory, on which we are aware of conscious states by perceiving them. This theory has also come to be known as higher-order perception. Rosenthal's theory also resembles somewhat the theory of Franz Brentano, on which our awareness of our own mental states is intrinsic to those states.\n\nBut the HOT theory avoids various difficulties that face the inner-sense theory, e.g., explaining what sensory modality the higher-order sensing could have (2004). And because the HOTs Rosenthal posits, unlike Brentano's intrinsic awareness, are external to the mental states they make one conscious of, the theory avoids difficulties Brentano's theory encounters about the individuation of mental states, as well as neuropsychological evidence (e.g., Libet) that mental states occur measurably before they are available for awareness (2004; 2005, ch. 2).\n\nGlobal-workspace theories (Stanislas Dehaene, Bernard Baars) posit that mental states are conscious in virtue of the wide availability of their content to various processing areas in the brain. The HOT theory has an advantage over such theories that it can explain the occurrence of conscious state whose content is not thus available, such as relatively peripheral perceptions and thoughts, and unconscious states whose content is widely available, such as repressed psychological states.\n\nFirst-order theories, such as Dretske's and Ned Block's, deny that a mental state's being conscious consists in some awareness of that state, and so have no easy way to explain the difference between conscious states and mental states that are not conscious. Rosenthal's HOT theory provides an intuitively natural way to do so.\n\nRosenthal is currently working on function of mental states' being conscious, which he argues is minimal, and on explaining why mental states do ever occur consciously if little utility results from their being conscious. He argues that the factors that explain why qualitative states, such as perceptions, often occur consciously are different from the considerations that explain why thoughts and other intentional states often occur consciously. He gave this talk, 'Consciousness and its Function' at the Online Consciousness Conference\n\nRosenthal has also written extensively about the connection between consciousness, thought, and speech, and has edited several anthologies.\n\n\nRosenthal is also the author of numerous articles, many of which can be found on his webpage (https://www.davidrosenthal.org/).\n\n\n\n"}

His father, Mihailo, was in the service of the Austro-Hungarian government and ran an experimental farm. Dimitrije was educated at Mostar Gymnasium. As a young student he was the formulator of the principal program of \"Mlada Bosna\", a political movement called Young Bosnia, in his country's struggle for independence from Austria-Hungary and in the moves to create a united Yugoslavia. During this period Mitrinović edited the Sarajevo literary paper, \"Bosanska Vila\", whose contributors included poets Risto Radulović and Vladimir \"Vlado\" Gaćinović. All three were born a few years apart in the late second half of the nineteenth century and all three have been members of secret political societies illegal in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Of the three friends, only Mitrinović survived World War I (Gaćinović died in 1917 and Radulović died in an Austrian prison camp in 1915).\n\nHaving studied history of art in Munich, Mitrinović came to England in 1914 to work for the Serbian Legation in London and moved among influential cultural circles in this country. From late 1914 to early 1915, there was an exhibition of work by Ivan Meštrović at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which included a model of a monument he had designed to commemorate the Battle of Kosovo.\n\nA mysterious personality in Serbian and European cultural history, he began his work in the field of art by translating \"Rig-Veda\" and the works of Virgil into Serbian. He studied philosophy and art history while staying in Rome, Madrid, Paris, Munich, and Tübingen. He was one of the first advocates of the avant-garde artistic group Der Blaue Reiter and gave a lecture on the art of Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nBeing in favour of the building of a universal utopia, like many of the leading minds of his time, he wrote about the inevitable creation of the Pan-European community. Ten years before \"La rebellion de las masas\" by Ortega y Gasset, Mitrinović prophesied: \"Being different from the other races, the population of Europe has always given birth to its contradictions and always with the chances of their solution in some ultimate synthesis.\"\n\nHe was a regular contributor to the epoch-making periodical \"The New Age\" (the author of the column \"World Affairs\"), alongside Ezra Pound, and according to Edwin Muir, Mitrinović \"has erupted with wild and profound contemplations ... not looking several ages ahead, like Shaw or Wells, but several millennia ahead.\"\n\nThe Utopian and messianic ideas of Mitrinović (incorporating the philosophical concepts of Husserl and Peter Demianovich Ouspensky, the theosophical doctrine of G. I. Gurdjieff, and the psychoanalytical school of Freud, Jung and Adler) were brought to the attention of the public not only in the periodical \"The New Age\" but also in the periodical \"The New Atlantis\" (which Mitrinović edited) and \"The New Albion\" (which he co-edited with A.R. Orage).\n\nMitrinović founded the \"Adler's Society\" (the English Branch of the International Society for Individual Psychology), but later he and Adler went different ways due, allegedly, to \"politicizing of his scientific concepts\". Mitrinović later founded \"the New Europe Group\".\n\nMitrinović advocated a metaphysical Utopia (based on Plotinus, Clement of Alexandria, Lao Tzu, Jakob Böhme) but was also politically pragmatic. He published an open letter to Adolf Hitler in 1933 in which he accused Hitler of \"behaving and acting as an evil superman ... possessed with some weird vision\" which is \"uncomprehendable by the human mind and belief and quite certain, and in all forms and essence, directed against the Orthodox soul.\"\n\nThe works of Mitrinović have remained scattered in numerous European periodicals (like the provocative texts based on psychological and philosophical theories, such as: \"Frojd prema Adleru\" (Freud versus Adler), \"Značaj Jungovog dela\" (The Importance of Jung's Work), \"Marks i Niče kao istorijska pozadina Adlera\" (Marx and Nietzsche being the Historical Background of Adler), \"Načela genija\" (The Principles of a Genius), \"Carstvo snova\" (The Realm of Dreams). Many of his works (including much of his poetry) were published in Serbian periodicals, and one of his major works, \"Aesthetic Contemplations\", was published in \"Bosanska Vila\".\n\nIn addition to the selected works of Dimitrije Mitrinović (published in the Serbian language, a number of years after his death) and the special study by Predrag Palavestra, \"Dogma i utopija\" (Dogma and Utopia), in the Serbian language in 1977), two books have been distributed by Columbia University Press, New York; the first of them was published in 1984 and the second one in 1987. The authors of these books are Andrew Rigby (\"Initiation and Initiative: An Exploration of the Life and Ideas of Dimitrije Mitrinović\") and H. C. Rutherford (\"Certainly Future: Selected Writings by Dimitrije Mitrinović\").\n\nIn 1914, wishing to establish the movement \"The Fundamentals of the Future\", he maintained correspondence with the following potential associates: Giovanni Papini, Stanisław Przybyszewski, Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem, Upton Sinclair, Henri Bergson, H.G. Wells, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Leonid Andreyev, Maxim Gorky, Maurice Maeterlinck, Pablo Picasso, Filippo T. Marinetti, Anatole France, George Bernard Shaw, and Knut Hamsun.\n\nThe Mitrinović Library contains a collection of over 4,500 volumes, based on Mitrinović's private collection. The Library thus reflects Mitrinović's very wide range of interests and command of languages. Particular areas of strength are philosophy, politics, society, religions and esoterica. The collection includes rare books on art history, literature, psychology, history, science, oriental studies, astrology, Freemasonry, theosophy and more. Most material is from the nineteenth and early twentieth century; the main languages used are English and German, with some French, Asian, and Eastern European languages.\n\nPart of the library was bequeathed to the Belgrade University Library in 1956 and part of it donated to University of Bradford in 2003 and 2004.\n\nThe archive, which was donated to the \"University of Bradford\" by the Foundation of \"New Atlantis\" in 2003 and 2004, includes published and unpublished writings of Mitrinović and documents and correspondence produced by members of Mitrinović's circle, members of the \"New Europe Group\" and members of the \"New Atlantis Foundation\".\n\n\n \n"}

The organization supports and promotes international wild cat research and conservation by collaborating on field research projects, partnering with other environmental organizations, and developing community outreach and education programs.\n\nFCF was founded in 2006 by conservationist and entrepreneur Zara McDonald. As a competitive marathon runner, McDonald twice encountered mountain lions during solitary runs in the Marin Headlands in Northern California. These encounters led her to become involved in California mountain lion research in 2002, and she soon expanded her research work to include other wild cat species. In the fall of 2004, after returning from extended capture work with mountain lions, she began developing a conservation model that combined scientific research with education and outreach programs. This led her to found the Felidae Conservation Fund (501(c)(3)) in April 2006.\n\nToday Felidae supports and collaborates in scientific research projects in nine countries, promotes community-level education and outreach programs, and fosters international cooperation among scientists, conservationists, governments, and environmental NGOs. Felidae is based in Sausalito, California, and raises money through donations, grants, fundraising events and online social networks.\n\nFCF's mission is to advance the conservation of the planet's wild cat species and their habitats through partnerships in research, education and technology. Its model is to collaborate on research studies that examine human impact on wild cats and their habitats, then disseminate the results in outreach and education programs designed to convince people of the importance of preserving the natural environment. Felidae collaborates with scientists, educators, communities and lawmakers with the goal of protecting ecosystems, staving off further extinctions, and promoting healthy ways for humans to coexist with wild cats and their habitats.\n\nFelidae's focus on wild cat conservation is motivated by the belief that the study of wild cats can serve as a leverage point for addressing the broader environmental issues of habitat loss, human-nature interactions, and wildlife sustainability. This belief is based on the idea that because cats are often the top predators in the ecosystems they inhabit, understanding and solving the problems they face can inform and guide the conservation and preservation of wild animals and wild habitats of all kinds.\n\nFelidae currently collaborates on research projects in field locations around the globe, including the United States, Malaysia, Mongolia, Chile, Peru, Iran, Namibia and Pakistan. Felidae provides strategic guidance, funding, field support, supplies and equipment to its project partners to help them achieve their research goals.\n\nTo link this scientific research to conservation efforts, Felidae incorporates the results of field studies into its outreach and education programs.

Like most types of feminist ethics, feminist justice ethics looks at how gender is left out of mainstream ethical considerations. Mainstream ethics are argued to be male-oriented. However, feminist justice ethics does differ considerably from other feminist ethics. A universal set of ethics is a significant part of feminist justice ethics. Feminist justice ethics is clear in dividing \"thick\" morality from \"thin\" morality. Other ethical approaches that define themselves by differentiating groups from one another through culture or other phenomena are regarded as \"thick\" accounts of morality. Feminist justice ethics claims that \"thick\" accounts of morality, as opposed to \"thin\" accounts of morality, are intrinsically prone to eroding valid feminist critique.\n\nFeminist justice ethics is part of a range of feminist ethical perspectives. Other popular feminist approaches to ethics include feminist ethics of care, and feminist postmodern ethics. The implementation of a feminist ethic of care often draws critique from feminist justice ethics. Feminist ethics of care is premised by the idea that morality is shaped by relational versions of our self. Our moral relations take precedence. Feminist justice ethics differs itself from feminist ethics of care by chastising such a perspective for its abandonment of universal values. In feminist justice ethics, legitimate ethical critique cannot be made without utilizing a universal set of ethics. Meanwhile, feminist postmodern ethics puts forth an entirely different view. A feminist postmodern perspective will perceive androcentricity in many aspects of life, including epistemology. At the same time feminist postmodernism will deny the existence of objectivity within our world. This claim is based on the notion that knowledge is subjectively constructed. One feminist postmodern scholar has implicated the ethical outcomes of modern business norms as a result of this masculine-dominated society. Friction between feminist justice ethics and feminist postmodern ethics exists on the principle of universality. The former supports the idea of universal values, while the latter denies such values exist because it denies objectivity.\nSince a universal view on morality is typical in feminist justice ethics, the question arises: what specific values are actually universal? Nussbaum's capabilities approach attempts to tackle this question, and lists several traits she believes to be universal:\n\n\nFeminist ethics of care disagrees with feminist justice ethics on some issues. Feminist ethics of care critiques feminist justice ethics with the claim that by lumping women into universal categories of being, the emphasis on distinct virtues that may be held primarily by women is lost. This loss of emphasis leads back to the masculine norms that feminist ethics are attempting to critique.\n\nFeminist postmodern ethics may cite a number of factors. One source of concern would be the universality that is presented by many feminist justice ethicists. Feminist postmodern ethics is heavily reliant on deconstructing society and critiquing objectivity. Another point of concern regarding Nussbaum's argument in particular is that feminist justice ethics may ignore women who do not belong to Western cultures. By assuming ethics from a Western point of view, other views on ethics may be lost or seen as inferior.\n"}
{"id": "179141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179141", "title": "Friedrich Eduard Beneke", "text": "Friedrich Eduard Beneke\n\nFriedrich Eduard Beneke (; 17 February 1798 – c. 1 March 1854) was a German psychologist and post-Kantian philosopher.\n\nBeneke was born in Berlin. He studied at the universities of Halle and Berlin, and served as a volunteer in the War of 1815. After studying theology under Schleiermacher and de Wette, he turned to pure philosophy, studying English writers and the German modifiers of Kantianism, such as Jacobi, Fries and Schopenhauer. In 1820, he published \"Erkenntnisslehre\", \"Erfahrungsseelenlehre als Grundlage alles Wissens\", and his inaugural dissertation \"De Veris Philosophiae Initiis\". His marked opposition to the philosophy of Hegel, then dominant in Berlin, was shown more clearly in the short tract, \"Neue Grundlegung zur Metaphysik\" (1822), intended to be the programme for his lectures as \"Privatdozent\", and in the able treatise, \"Grundlegung zur Physik der Sitten\" (1822), written, in direct antagonism to Kant's \"Metaphysics of Morals\", to deduce ethical principles from a basis of empirical feeling. In 1822 his lectures were prohibited in Berlin, because of the influence of Hegel with the Prussian authorities, who also prevented him from obtaining a chair from the Saxon government. He retired to Göttingen, lectured there for several years, and was then allowed to return to Berlin. In 1832 he received an appointment as \"professor extraordinarius\" at the university, which he continued to hold till his death. On 1 March 1854 he disappeared, and more than two years later his remains were found in the canal near Charlottenburg. There was some suspicion that he had committed suicide in a fit of mental depression.\n\nThe distinctive features of Beneke's system are the firmness with which he maintained that in empirical psychology is to be found the basis of all philosophy, and his rigid treatment of mental phenomena by the genetic method. According to Beneke, the perfected mind is a development from simple elements, and the first problem of philosophy is the determination of these elements and of the processes by which the development takes place. In his \"Neue Psychologie\" (essays iii., viii. and ix.), he defined his position with regard to his predecessors and contemporaries. This and the introduction to his \"Lehrbuch\" signaled the two great stages in tile progress of psychology the negation of innate ideas by John Locke, and of faculties, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, by Herbart. The next step was his own; he insisted that psychology must be treated as one of the natural sciences. As is the case with them, its content is given by experience alone, and differs from theirs only in being the object of the internal as opposed to the external sense. But by this Beneke in no wise meant a psychology founded on physiology. These two sciences, in his opinion, had quite distinct provinces and gave no mutual assistance. Just as little help is to be expected from the science of the body as from mathematics and metaphysics, both of which had been pressed by Herbart into the service of psychology. The true method of study is that applied with so much success in the physical sciences: critical examination of the given experience, and reference of it to ultimate causes, which may not be perceived, but are nevertheless hypotheses necessary to account for the facts. (See on method, \"Neue Psych.\", essay i.)\n\nStarting from the two assumptions that there is nothing, or at least no formed product, innate in the mind, and that definite faculties do not originally exist, and from the fact that our minds nevertheless actually have a definite content and definite modes of action, Beneke proceeds to state somewhat dogmatically his scientifically verifiable hypotheses as to the primitive condition of the soul and the laws according to which it develops. Originally the soul is possessed of or is an immense variety of powers, faculties or forces (conceptions which Beneke, in opposition to Herbart, holds to be metaphysically justifiable), differing from one another only in tenacity, vivacity, receptivity and grouping. These primitive immaterial forces, so closely united as to form but one being (essence), acquire definiteness or form through the action upon them of stimuli or excitants from the outer world. This action of external impressions which are appropriated by the internal powers is the first fundamental process in the genesis of the completed mind. If the union of impression and faculty be sufficiently strong, consciousness (not self-consciousness) arises, and definite sensations and perceptions begin to be formed. These primitive sensations, however, are not to be identified with the special senses, for each of these senses is a system of many powers which have grown into a definite unity, have been educated by experience. From ordinary experience it must be concluded that a second fundamental process is incessantly going on: the formation of new powers, which takes place principally during sleep. The third and most important process results from the fact that the combination between stimulus and power may be weak or strong; if weak, then tile two elements are said to be movable, and they may flow over from one to another of the already formed psychical products. Any formed faculty does not cease to exist on the removal of its stimulus; in virtue of its fundamental property, tenacity, it sinks back as a trace (\"Spur\") into unconsciousness, whence it may be recalled by the application to it of another stimulus, or by the attraction towards it of some of the movable elements or newly formed original powers. These traces and the flowing over of the movable elements are the most important conceptions in Beneke's psychology. Through them he gives a rationale of reproduction and association, and strives to show that all the formed faculties are simply developments from traces of earlier processes. Lastly, similar forms, according to the degree of their similarity, attract one another or tend to form closer combinations.\n\nAll psychical phenomena are explicable by the relation of impression and power, and by the flow of movable elements; the whole process of mental development is nothing but the result of the action and interaction of the above simple laws. In general this growth may be said to take the direction of rendering more and more definite by repetition and attraction of like to like tile originally indefinite activities of the primary faculties. Thus, the sensations of the special senses are gradually formed from the primary sensuous feelings (\"sensliche Empfindungen\"); concepts are formed from intuitions of individuals by the attraction of the common elements, and the consequent flow towards them of movable forms. Judgment is the springing into consciousness of a concept alongside of an intuition, or of a higher concept alongside of a lower. Reasoning is merely a more complex judgment. Nor are there special faculties of judging or reasoning. The understanding is simply the mass of concepts lying in the background of unconsciousness, ready to be called up and to flow with force towards anything closely connected with them. Even memory is not a special faculty; it is simply the fundamental property of tenacity possessed by the original faculties. The very distinction between the three great classes, knowledge, feeling and will, may be referred to elementary differences in the original relations of faculty and impression.\n\nThis is the groundwork of Beneke's philosophy. It should be compared with the association psychology of modern British thinkers, most of whose results and processes wiil be found worked into a comprehensive system in Beneke's work. In logic, metaphysics and ethics, Beneke's speculations are naturally dependent on his psychology.\n\nThe special value of Beneke's works is found in the many specimens of acute psychological analysis scattered throughout them. As a complete explanation of psychical facts, the theory seems defective. The original hypotheses, peculiar to Beneke, on which the whole depends, are hastily assumed and rest on a clumsy mechanical metaphor. As is the case with all empirical theories of mental development, the higher categories or notions, which are apparently shown to result from the simple elements, are really presupposed at every step. Particularly unsatisfactory is the account of consciousness, which is said to arise from the union of impression and faculty. The necessity of consciousness for any mental action whatsoever is apparently granted, but the conditions involved in it are never discussed or mentioned. The same defect appears in the account of ethical judgment; no amount of empirical fact can ever yield the notion of absolute duty. His results have found acceptance mainly with practical teachers. Undoubtedly his minute analysis of temperament and careful exposition of the means whereby the young, unformed mind may be trained are of infinite value; but the truth of many of his doctrines on these points lends no support to the fundamental hypotheses, from which, indeed, they might be almost entirely severed.\n\nGerman writers who, though not professed followers of Beneke, were influenced by him, include Friedrich Ueberweg and Karl Fortlage. In Britain, the only writer who showed acquaintance with his works is J. D. Morell (\"Introduction to Mental Philosophy\").\n\nThe most eminent members of the school are (\"Beneke oder die Seelenlehre als Naturwissenschaft\"), Fried, Friedrich Dittes, and Charles Gottlieb Raue. The compendium by the last-named author passed through four editions in Germany, and has been translated into French, Flemish and English. The English translation, \"Elements of Psychology\" (1871), gives a lucid and succinct view of the whole system.\n\nBeneke was a prolific writer, and besides the works mentioned above, published large treatises in several departments of philosophy, both pure and as applied to education and ordinary life. A complete list of his writings will be found in the appendix to Dressier's edition of the \"Lehrbuch der Psychologie als Naturwissenschaft\" (1861). The chief ones are:\n\n"}

{"id": "2929560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2929560", "title": "Hyle", "text": "Hyle\n\nIn philosophy, hyle (; from ) refers to matter or stuff. It can also be the material cause underlying a change in Aristotelian philosophy. The Greeks originally had no word for matter in general, as opposed to raw material suitable for some specific purpose or other, so Aristotle adapted the word for \"wood\" to this purpose. The idea that everything physical is made of the same basic substance holds up well under modern science, although it may be thought of more in terms of energy or matter/energy.\n\nThe Aristotelian concept of \"hyle\" is the principle that correlates with \"eidos\" (form) and this can be demonstrated in the way the philosopher described \"hyle,\" saying it is that which receives form or definiteness, that which is formed. Aristotle explained that \"By \"hyle\" I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor of a certain quantity nor assigned to any other of the categories by which being is determined.\" This means that hyle is brought into existence not due to its being its agent or its own actuality but only when form attaches to it. It is maintained that the Aristotelian concept should not be understood as a \"stuff\" since there is, for example, \"hyle\" that is intellectual as well as sensible \"hyle\" found in the body. \n\nFor Aristotle, hyle is composed of four elements - fire, water, air, and earth - but these were not considered pure substances since matter and form exist in a combination of hot, moist, dry, and cold so that everything is united to form the elements.\n\nThe matter of hyle is closely related to that of substance, in so far as both endure a change in form, or transformation. Aristotle defined primary substance as that which can neither be predicated nor attributed to something else, and he explained the transformation between the four terrestrial elements in terms of an abstract primary matter that underlies each element due to the four combinations of two properties: hot or cold and wet or dry. He stipulated that transformations between opposing elements, where both properties differ, must be analyzed as two discrete steps wherein one of the two properties changes to its contrary while the other remains unchanged (see essence and hylomorphism).\n\nModern substance theory differs, for example Kant's \"Ding an sich\", or \"thing in itself\", is generally described as whatever is its own cause, or alternatively as a thing whose only property is that it is that thing (or, in other words, that it has only that property). However, this notion is subject to the criticism, as by Nietzsche, that there is no way to \"directly\" prove the existence of any thing which has no properties, since such a thing could not possibly interact with other things and thus would be unobservable and indeterminate.\n\nOn the other hand, we may need to postulate a substance that endures through change in order to explain the nature of change—without an enduring factor that persists through change, there is no change but only a succession of unrelated events. The existence of change is hard to deny, and if we have to postulate something \"unobserved\" in order to explain what \"is\" observed, that is a valid \"indirect\" demonstration (by abductive reasoning). Moreover, something like a prime substance is posited by physics in the form of matter/energy.\n\n"}

He was born at Valencia and settled early in life at Barcelona, where he studied at the school of Nissim of Gerona.\n\nAlthough Isaac, while still young, acquired a worldwide reputation as a Talmudic authority, and halakic inquiries were addressed to him from all quarters, he led a private life, earning his livelihood in commerce until he was about fifty years old, when he was compelled to accept a position as rabbi. Together with six other prominent men of Barcelona, among whom was his younger brother Judah ben Sheshet and his teacher Nissim ben Reuben, he was thrown into prison on a false accusation. After his acquittal he accepted the rabbinate of Zaragoza; but troubles still awaited him. To the grief caused by the death of his brother Judah and of his son-in-law was added that due to dissensions in the community, stirred up by the \"dayyan\" Joseph ben David. Isaac in consequence accepted the less important rabbinate of Calatayud; but when he was on the point of leaving Zaragoza the leaders of that community induced him to stay. The peace, however, did not remain long undisturbed, and Isaac settled at Valencia, where he directed a Talmudical school.\n\nIn 1391 occurred the great persecutions of the Jews of Spain in consequence of the preaching of Fernandes Martinez. On the first day of the persecutions, the younger brother of King John I, summoned Issac on July 9, 1391. He explained that to be able to restrain and cease the bloodshed, it would be necessary to promulgate an organized conversion of the Jews, which should obviously start with the communal leaders. Some of the leaders did relent to the heavy pressure laid upon them; but not Issac, who held steadfast to his faith. After a couple of days, the officials set up false witnesses to testify against Issac for a disgraceful crime. Due to this accusation, Issac was condemned to death, by burning at the stake in the city's central square. Due to this ruling, Issac thought of the public burning and spreading false accusations against him, as a desecration to him and his religion, more than immersing and later escaping and returning to his original faith. On July 11 Issac was immersed, donned the robe of a Dominican and received the name Jaume De-valencia. About a year and a half later, Issac escaped to the Muslim lands in northern Africa, with the help of Hasdai Crescas, where he once again was able to practice the Jewish faith publicly, at about the age of 66-67. After sojourning a certain time at Miliana he settled at Algiers, where he was received with great honor.\n\nA certain Spanish refugee who had settled at Algiers before him aspired to become the leader of the community, and, seeing in Isaac a rival, began to persecute him. To give to Isaac the power necessary to act against this man, Saul ha-Kohen Astrue persuaded the government to appoint Isaac rabbi of Algiers. But this won for him a still more powerful enemy in the person of Simeon ben Zemah Duran, who disapproved of any intervention on the part of the government in the affairs of the rabbinate.\n\nNotwithstanding these events, Isaac was greatly venerated by the Algerian Jews, and pilgrimages to his tomb are still made on the anniversary of his death, which occurred in 1408. His tombstone was restored by the community of Algiers in 1862. It bears a Hebrew elegy, composed by Abba Mari ibn Caspi, and the following French inscription: \"Ce monument a été restauré par la communauté Israélite d'Alger en I'honneur du Rabbin Isaac bar Chichat, né en Espagne, décédé à Alger en 1408, dans sa 82 année. Alger le 11 août, 1862.\" The accuracy of the date of his death given in this epitaph is, however, questioned by some scholars, who claim with some authority that Isaac died at least one year later.\n\nIsaac was the author of 518 \"responsa\", to which great halakic value is attached by men like Joseph Caro, Jacob Berab, and many others. They are also of great historical importance as reflecting the conditions of Jewish life in the fourteenth century. In some of them are to be found details of the author's life; but unfortunately it is impossible to trace these chronologically, the original order of the responsa having been altered by the editors.\n\nAlthough Isaac was very strict in his halakic decisions, he was far from being narrow-minded. He has nothing to say against secular knowledge; he disapproves the study of Aristotle only because the latter professed belief in the eternity of matter and denied God's providence. Isaac's \"responsa\" evidence a profound knowledge of the philosophical writings of his time. In one of them (No. 118) he explains the difference between the opinion of Levi ben Gershom and that of Abraham ben David of Posquières on free will, and gives his own views on that complicated subject. He shows himself a decided adversary of the Kabbalah. His teacher says Isaac never spoke of the \"Sefirot\", and Isaac cites the words of one of the philosophizers who reproaches the kabbalists with believing in the ten (Sefirot) as the Christians believe in the Trinity.\n\nIsaac's \"responsa\" were first published, under the title \"She'elot u-Teshubot\", at Constantinople in 1546-47. A newer collection of the responsa was published under the title \"She'elot u-Teshubot ha-Ribash ha-Ḥadashot\" by David Frenkl at Muncas. In addition to these, he wrote novellæ on the Talmud which are no longer in existence. They are mentioned by him in his responsa (No. 106), and some of them, on the treatise Ketubot, are cited by Bezalel Ashkenazi in the \"Shiṭṭah Meḳubbeẓet\". Azulai says that he has seen a manuscript containing a commentary on the Pentateuch by Isaac ben Sheshet.\n\n"}

He frequently opposed the policies of New York Governor William Cosby and in 1732, Cosby succeeded in having Alexander removed from the Council. In 1733, Alexander started an anti-Cosby newspaper, the \"New York Weekly Journal\", with Peter Zenger as publisher. Alexander was the principal author of pieces critical of Governor Cosby. The following year, Zenger was arrested on sedition charges, but eventually a jury acquitted Zenger in one of the first instances of jury nullification. Alexander and William Smith served as Zenger's attorneys until both were disbarred after they challenged the commissions of the judges hearing the case.\n\nIn 1730, Alexander was chairman of the committee to revise the New York City charter; he was given the freedom of the city the following year. When Lord De La Warr was appointed governor in 1737, Alexander was reinstated to the bar and reappointed to the governor's Council of New York. His removal from the Council of New Jersey was disregarded. Alexander became a vocal proponent of the emerging Whig political views, and engaged in various civic efforts as well. In 1751, he raised funds to establish King's College.\n\nAlthough he remained active in politics, his legal practice eventually absorbed most of his time and energy, and his political involvement waned. He was an original member of the American Philosophical Society, founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, Alexander, Francis Hopkinson, John Bartram, Philip Syng, Jr. and others\n\nOn June 5, 1721, Alexander married the wealthy widow Mary Spratt Provoost (1693–1760). She was the daughter of John Spratt (c. 1650–1697) and Maria de Peyster (1659–1700). Her DePuyster uncles drafted the prenuptial agreements. Mary was the widow of Samuel Provoost (d. 1719), the younger brother of David Proovost, the 24th mayor of New York City, with whom she had three children. Together, James and Mary had seven children:\n\n\nIn 1756, while on a trip to Albany to confer with other Whig leaders, he suffered a flare up of his gout which led to a deterioration of his health. He returned home ill as a result and died in Albany or New York City on April 2, 1756.\n\nThrough his daughter Mary, he was the grandmother of 12 grandchildren, including Philip Peter Livingston (1740–1810). \n\nThrough his son William, he was the grandfather of three, William Alexander, Mary Alexander, who married a wealthy merchant named Robert Watts of New York, and Catherine Alexander, who married Congressman William Duer (1747–1799).\n\nThrough his daughter Elizabeth, he was the grandfather of John Stevens III (1749–1838), a lawyer, engineer, and inventor who constructed the first U.S. steam locomotive and first steam-powered ferry, and Mary Stevens (d. 1814), who married Chancellor Robert Livingston, negotiator of the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nThrough his daughter Catherine, he was the grandfather of John Rutherfurd (1760–1840), a Federalist member of the United States Senate from New Jersey who served from 1791 to 1798, who married Helena Magdalena Morris (1762–1840), daughter of Congressman Lewis Morris of Morrisania.\n\n\n\n"}

Outreach efforts are instead directed at Jews who have \"gone astray\", or who have been born Jewish in a non-observant family.\n\nThe idea of \"Jewish outreach\" has mixed support among Jews; some are against the concept, while others share a vision of a more accessible and inclusive Jewish community.\n\nIn the United States, a country with a large Secular Jewish population and a 50% intermarriage rate, some Jewish federations and educational organizations provide an extensive range of offerings to the intermarried, to those who are marginally engaged with Jewish life, and to those who haven’t had any involvement in Judaism since attending Hebrew school or right after their bar mitzvah. \"Chabad Lubavitch\" was the first Orthodox Jewish organization in the United States to promote outreach means of recruiting unobservant Jews who commit to living an observant lifestyle. \n\nRabbi Dr. Shmuly Yanklowitz wrote that \"outreach should enrich lives and society by making the Torah’s wisdom more broadly available. Further, outreach is not only about “one’s own” and we must bring people of different religions together in mutual understanding and respect by engaging in deep interfaith dialogue.\n\nRabbi Levi Brackman said, \"with the high rate of assimilation and intermarriage in the West, I cannot imagine that there could be too many outreach workers in the field. The day that happens will be a blessed one. The battle against assimilation is far too important for its warriors to get embroiled in politics of this sort.

In 1892 he received his doctorate with his dissertation, \"Idee und Perzeption\" (Idea and Perception), and in 1894 he presented his habilitation thesis, \"Zur Lehre vom Inhalt und Gegenstand der Vorstellungen\" (On the Doctrine of the Content and Object of Presentations). He originated many novel ideas related to metaphilosophy.\n\nHe lectured in Vienna in the years 1894–95, then was appointed professor at Lwów (Lemberg in Austrian Galicia, now Lviv in the Ukraine). An outstanding lecturer, he was also a rector of the Lwów University during World War I.\n\nThere Twardowski established the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic and also became the \"father of Polish logic\", beginning the tradition of scientific philosophy in Poland. Among his students were the logicians Stanisław Leśniewski, Jan Łukasiewicz and Tadeusz Czeżowski, the historian of philosophy Władysław Tatarkiewicz, the phenomenologist and aesthetician Roman Ingarden, as well as philosophers close to the Vienna Circle such as Tadeusz Kotarbiński and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\nIn his \"On the Content and Object of Presentations\", Twardowski argues for a distinction between content and object in the frame of the theory of intentionality of his teacher Franz Brentano. According to him the mind is divided in two main areas: \"acts\" or \"mental phenomena\", and a \"physical phenomenon\". For example, an act of presentation is aimed at a presentation. This is what he called ‘intentionality’, aboutness. Every act is about something, but also every presentation goes together with an act of presentation.\n\nThis theory suffers from the problem that it is not clear what the presentation exactly is. Is the presentation something only in the mind, or is it also in the world as object? Twardowski says that sometimes presentation is used for the object in the world and sometimes for the immanent content of a mental phenomena.\n\nTwardowski offers a solution for this problem and proposes to make a distinction between the content of a presentation and the object of a presentation.\n\nIn his book Twardowski offers an analogy to clarify this distinction. He uses the example of a painting. People say of a landscape that it is painted, but also of a painting that it is painted. In the first case the word ‘painting’ is used in a modifying way (a painted landscape is not a landscape at all), while in the latter case the word painting is used in a qualitative or attributive way. Twardowski argues that presentations are similar. The content is the painted painting and the object is the painted landscape. The content resembles the present ‘picture’ in one's mind, and the object the landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Clara is characterized as reserved and shy and was later considered an \"ideal\" role model for women in Philippine culture. \n\nThe doctrine became a part of the Supreme Court of the Philippines' jurisprudence sometime in 1960 following the \"People v. Taño\" case. The high court through Justice Alejo Labrador has asserted a \"well known fact\" that women, especially Filipinos \"would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened.\" The court said that women's natural instict is to protect their honor.The case involved three armed robbers who the court found liable for taking turns in raping a woman.\n\nAbout 58 years later since the doctrine entered the high court's jurisprudence, the Third Division of the Supreme Court reverse a ruling on January 17, 2018 by a Davao court on two people convicted of rape.

The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 2016.\nThe court described the doctrine as causing a \"travesty of justice\" by putting the accused at an \"unfair disadvantage\", criticizing the doctrine for assuming that no Filipina woman of \"decent repute\" would falsely claim that she was abused. It urged for the acceptance of the \"realities of a woman’s dynamic role\" in Philippine society today so one can \"evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception\". It also stated that the discrepancies in the alleged victim's testimonies had cast doubt on whether the rape incident did or did not happen.\n\nThis has led to concerns and speculations that the high court has abandoned the doctrine. The Gabriela Women's Party condemned the decision which it viewed made the Maria Clara doctrine invalid saying the ruling reversal will empower rapists and disagreed with the court's assessment of the societal status of women.\n\nOn February 21, 2018, Supreme Court's spokesperson, Theodore Te has clarified that it was not the case since the high court can abandon a doctrine only during a full session.\n"}

In 1896 she became the first Spanish woman to earn a degree in Philosophy and Letters and the first to earn her doctorate, in 1909, at a Spanish university (the University of Madrid). She was the wife of Ramón Menéndez Pidal. \n\nBorn in Madrid to a Basque family, she spent her early years in Algorta, a seaside village in the province of Biscay. She returned to Madrid with her mother, Amalia Goyri, a seamstress of great character and culture. Due to her delicate health she was educated at home by her mother who frequently gave her lessons outdoors in the Buen Retiro Park to help combat her tubercular arthritis. Ignoring the conventions of the time she enrolled María in a gym and when she was twelve she began business courses at the Association for the Education of Women. There she discovered she enjoyed the study of grammar and in 1887 she enrolled in the School for Governesses to become a teacher. In 1890 she and another young student, Carmen Gallardo, audited classes in the School of Philosophy and Letters at the University of Madrid. In 1892 she received permission from the General Secretary of Public Instruction to register officially as a female student in order to attend classes on the condition that her presence not distract male students. Prior to each class she was not permitted to wait in the corridor and had to wait in an office adjacent to her classroom. Her professor would then escort her to her own individual desk near his. At the end of class she would be escorted out the same way. One of her professors was the foremost academic of the day, the Spanish scholar and historian, Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo. In her first year she heard Emilia Pardo Bazán's presentation of \"The Education of Men & Women\" in which she attacked Rosseau and François Fénelon as anti-feminist and defended John Stuart Mill and Gottfried Leibniz for their progressive advocacy of educational reforms for women. When Concepción Arenal's presentation of her views on women's duties and rights provoked violent attacks, María stood up and vehemently defended the elderly activist. María Goyri obtained the titles of normal school professor (1893), licentiate in philosophy and letters (1896), and Doctor of Philosophy and letters (1909).\n\nMaría met Ramón Menéndez Pidal when Menéndez Pelayo took her to hear his former student give a lecture at the Graduate School of the University. Ramón was now a university professor and had obtained the chair in Romance Philology. Finding they shared the same interests she became his student and then his assistant. They were married in 1900 and for their honeymoon they retraced the geographic locales of the \"Poem of the Cid\" (Poema de mío Cid), the oldest preserved Spanish epic poem.\n\nThey had three children: Ramón, who died in childhood, Jimena and Gonzalo.\n\nMaría and Ramón devoted their lives to research on everything related to philology and the preservation of ancient Spanish history and ballads. She also collaborated with the \"Protectorado del Niño Delincuente\" (Child Delinquent Protectorate), an organization founded in 1916 to help prevent the incarceration of youths under the age of 16. When the \"Instituto Escuela de segunda enseñanza\" (High School Institute) was established in 1918 she taught language and literature. On October 23, 1933 she was elected board member of the \"Patronato del Centro para Ampliación de Estudios\" (Board for Advanced Studies) and worked along with Blas Cabrera, Luis Calandre, María de Maeztu and Luis de Zulueta. She taught at the Institute of Free Education (Junta para Ampliación de Estudios) until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War combining physical exercise along with intellectual studies.\n\nMaría and Ramón were at their country house at San Rafael, a town nestled on the royal road linking Madrid to the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, when the Civil war broke out taking them completely by surprise. They were with their daughter Jimena, her husband, Miguel Catalán Sañudo and their son Diego Catalán in an area controlled by military who had risen against the Second Spanish Republic. After bombardment by planes from the Cuatro Vientos Airport they were forced to flee to El Espinar and later to Segovia for safety. The war was a catastrophe for Goyri. They were on the side of Francisco Franco but she still defended her liberal views including equal rights for women in all areas, especially education. In the \"Archivo General de la Guerra Civil Española\" (General Archive of the Spanish Civil War) is a report that was made up by the National Defense Council led by Franco. It reveals that the family members of Menéndez Pidal-Catalán and their circle of friends were being discreetly watched and their correspondence checked. The report sent to Burgos, the base of the Nationalist government, said that \"Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Director of the Royal Spanish Academy, was weak of character and totally dominated by his wife, María Goyri, a cultured woman of great talent and extraordinary energy who has perverted her husband and children. She is very persuasive and one of the most dangerous people in Spain. Without doubt one of the more robust roots of the revolution.\"\n\nAfter the war the Free Institute of Education and all schools under the auspices of the Board for Advanced Studies were banned and teachers forbidden to promote women's equality in education and other liberal causes. In addition to teaching María devoted her later years to research, gathering and archiving different versions of ancient oral ballads that are now kept in the \"Fundación Ramón Menéndez Pidal\", a non-profit center dedicated to developing historical and philogical studies and humanistic research. Located at the olive grove garden of \"Olivar de Chamartin\" in the north of Madrid it is an indispensable source for scholars and is today considered part of the \"National Treasure\" of Spain.\n\nHer niece was the writer and activist María Teresa León (daughter of her sister Oliva) and her grandson was the Spanish philologist Diego Catalán who presided over the \"Fundación Ramón Menéndez Pidal\". There are streets in Alicante, Cordoba, Granada and Guadalajara named after her (\"Calle María Goyri\").\n\n"}

Hughes, he pointed out that the structure of quantum mechanics may be derived to a large extent from the assumption that microscopic phenomena cannot be dissociated from their experimental context. His views on quantum mechanics converge with ideas developed by Julian Schwinger and Asher Peres, according to whom quantum mechanics is a \"symbolism of atomic measurements\", rather than a description of atomic objects. He also defends ideas close to Anton Zeilinger's, by claiming that quantum laws do not express the nature of physical objects, but only the bounds of experimental information.\n\nAlong with this view, quantum mechanics is no longer considered as a physical theory in the ordinary sense, but rather as a background framework for physical theories, since it goes back to the most elementary conditions which allow us to formulate any physical theory whatsoever. Some reviewers suggested half-seriously to call this view of physics \"Kantum physics\". Indeed, Michel Bitbol often refers to the philosophy of I. Kant, according to whom one can understand the contents of knowledge only by analyzing the (sensorial, instrumental, and rational) conditions of possibility of such knowledge.\n\nHe was granted an award by the French \"Académie des sciences morales et politiques\" in 1997, for his work in the philosophy of quantum mechanics.\n\nLater on, he concentrated on the philosophy of mind and consciousness, defending a strongly anti-reductionist and neo-Wittgensteinian view. He collaborated with Francisco Varela on this subject.\n\nHe participated in the 2002/2013 conferences of the Mind and Life Institute, whose aim is to promote a dialogue between science and Buddhism. He subsequently wrote a book developing a thoroughly relational reading of quantum mechanics, with due reference to the Buddhist concept of dependent arising.\n\nTranslations\n\n"}

He had been the editor-in-chief of Modiriat (Management) monthly journal for years.. He published more than 200 papers and 10 books. He was without a doubt one of the greatest Persian intellectuals in their history as well as influencing the whole world.\n\nMohsen Ghanebasiri was born 24 Oct. 1949 in Tehran the capital city of Iran. He studied in Naserkhosrow Primary School, and Dar ul-Funun and Elmieh High Schools his secondary education. He graduated from Tehran University in chemistry. Afterward, he moved to the United States to continue his education as a chemist in Georgia University. He returned to Iran in 1979 and started working and writing on the managerial domains and started researching. \nWhile studying chemistry in the U.S. in the 70s, he did not confine himself to his field of study and read voraciously which made him a man of thought. He was interested in the issues related to the development as a student and did not consider it separate from the cultural domain. As a matter of fact, he believes in the kind of theorizing which, while recognizing human being, technology and culture as separate, considers them united in a domain and does not consider them independent from each other. Moreover, he holds that the key to success and reaching the ideal in this world is recognition firstly, and its scientific and appropriate management secondly.\n\nGhanebasiri founded Kimia Monthly Journal, the first professional petrochemical journal in Iran, after the Islamic Revolution. Despite being very professional, Kimia established itself very soon among its readers. Ghanebasiri published “From Information to Knowledge” two years after Kimia was closed down. This book is about the “Tripartite Equations Theory” and the relation between [physical] mass, energy and information. \nThe most important theory of this book revolves around the theory of the inverse proportionality of the mass, energy and information ratio as well as the hypothesis that there is an inverse proportionality between knowledge and awareness and the consumption of mass and energy by the systems. \nGhanebasiri has also published more than 500 articles in different journals, namely, Iran, Gozaresh (Report), San’ate Lastik (Rubber Industry), San’ate Pelastik (Plastic Industry), Amniate Melli (National Security) and Kimia. He was also the editor-in-chief of Modiriat (Management) Monthly Journal and Aryana Gardeshgar (Aryana Tourist) Magazine. which was published under the title of Saegheh (Thunderbolt) up to its 13th issue.\n\n\nGhanebasiri has provided his Tripartite Equations Theory based on two other principles theories: 1st. the inverse proportionality between awareness, mass, and energy 2nd. the Awareness Ratio Principle according to which the amount of the information given to the system permanently causes a decrease in awareness of the system and then leads to the quality drop in all the systems. This issue is defined in social domains, epistemological domains as well as the domains related to technology and culture. His theory was a breakthrough in epistemology as well as in cybernetics, society, and technology. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "318648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318648", "title": "Musica universalis", "text": "Musica universalis\n\nMusica universalis (literally universal music), also called Music of the spheres or Harmony of the Spheres, is an ancient philosophical concept that regards proportions in the movements of celestial bodies—the Sun, Moon, and planets—as a form of \"musica\" (the Medieval Latin term for music). This \"music\" is not usually thought to be literally audible, but a harmonic, mathematical or religious concept. The idea continued to appeal to thinkers about music until the end of the Renaissance, influencing scholars of many kinds, including humanists. Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions in some orbital motion, described as orbital resonance.\n\nThe discovery of the precise relation between the pitch of the musical note and the length of the string that produces it is attributed to Pythagoras.\nThe Music of the Spheres incorporates the metaphysical principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or \"tones\" of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. Pythagoras first identified that the pitch of a musical note is in inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios. In a theory known as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution, and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear. Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as \"twinned\" studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.\n\nAristotle criticised the notion that celestial bodies make a sound in moving in the context of his own cosmological model. From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of the stars produces a harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when the sun and the moon, they say, and all the stars, so great in number and in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce a sound immensely great? Starting from this argument and from the observation that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the smithy that it makes no difference to them. But, as we said before, melodious and poetical as the theory is, it cannot be a true account of the facts. There is not only the absurdity of our hearing nothing, the ground of which they try to remove, but also the fact that no effect other than sensitive is produced upon us. Excessive noises, we know, shatter the solid bodies even of inanimate things: the noise of thunder, for instance, splits rocks and the strongest of bodies. But if the moving bodies are so great, and the sound which penetrates to us is proportionate to their size, that sound must needs reach us in an intensity many times that of thunder, and the force of its action must be immense.\n\nThe three branches of the Medieval concept of musica were presented by Boethius in his book \"De Musica\":\n\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, the heavenly \"music of the spheres\" is heard in the \"Region of Concrete Thought\", the lower region of the mental plane, which is an ocean of harmony.\n\n\"See also: Harmonices Mundi\"\n\nM\"usica universalis\", which had existed since the Greeks, as a metaphysical concept was often taught in quadrivium, and this connection between music and astronomy intrigued Johannes Kepler, and he devoted much of his time after publishing the \"Mysterium\" \"Cosmographicum\" (Mystery of the Cosmos) looking over tables and trying to fit the data to what he believed to be the true nature of the cosmos. In 1619 Kepler published \"Harmonices Mundi\" (literally Harmony of the Worlds), expanding on the concepts he introduced in \"Mysterium\" and positing that musical intervals and harmonies describe the motions of the six known planets of the time. He believed that this harmony, while inaudible, could be heard by the soul, and that it gave a “very agreeable feeling of bliss, afforded him by this music in the imitation of God.” In \"Harmonices\", Kepler laid out an argument for a creator who had made an explicit connection between geometry, astronomy, and music, and that the planets were arranged in intelligently.\n\n\"Harmonices\" is split into five books, or chapters. The first and second books give a brief discussion on regular polyhedron and their congruences, reiterating the idea he introduced in \"Mysterium\" that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including consonance and dissonance, intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to. In the fourth book Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments for why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner as the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for heliocentrism. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on astrology in book five, Kepler ends \"Harmonices\" by describing his third law, which states that for any planet the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period.\n\nIn the final book of \"Harmonices\", Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum angular speeds of each planet (its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies. These speeds explain the eccentricity of the orbits of the planets in a natural way that appealed to Kepler’s religious beliefs in a heavenly creator.\n\nWhile Kepler did believe that the harmony of the worlds was inaudible, he related the motions of the planets to musical concepts in book four of \"Harmonices\". He makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between monophonic and polyphonic music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more “notes.” Earth’s maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus’ orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mars, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the solar system was comprised of two basses (Saturn and Jupiter), a tenor (Mars), two altos (Venus and Earth), and a soprano (Mercury), which had sung in “perfect concord,” at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again. He was certain of the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies of the heavens and believed that “man, the imitator of the Creator,” had emulated the polyphony of the heavens so as to enjoy “the continuous duration of the time of the world in a fraction of an hour.”\n\nKepler was so convinced in a creator that he was convinced of the existence of this harmony despite a number of inaccuracies present in \"Harmonices\". Many of the ratios differed by an error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval, and the ratio between Mars’ and Jupiter’s angular velocities does not create a consonant interval, though every other combination of planets does. Kepler brushed aside this problem by making the argument, with the math to support it, that because these elliptical paths had to fit into the regular solids described in \"Mysterium\" the values for both the dimensions of the solids and the angular speeds would have to differ from the ideal values to compensate. This change also had the benefit of helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfect.\n\nThe connection between music, mathematics, and astronomy had a profound impact on history. It resulted in music's inclusion in the Quadrivium, the medieval curriculum that included arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, and along with the Trivium (grammar, logic,and rhetoric) made up the seven liberal arts, which are still the basis for higher education today. A small number of recent compositions either make reference to or are based on the concepts of Musica Universalis or Harmony of the Spheres. Among these are \"Music of the Spheres\" by Mike Oldfield, \"Om\" by the Moody Blues, \"The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi\" album by The Receiving End of Sirens, \"Music of the Spheres\" by Ian Brown\",\" and Björk's single \"Cosmogony\", included in her 2011 album \"Biophilia\". Earlier, in the 1910s, Danish composer Rued Langgaard composed a pioneering orchestral work titled \"Music of the Spheres\". \"Music of the Spheres\" was also the title chosen for the musical foundation of the video-game Destiny, and was composed by Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori, and Paul McCartney. Paul Hindemith wrote an Opera (1957), and a Symphony using the same music, called 'Die Harmonie der Welt' based upon the life of the Astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630).\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is about Pontus, the son of the king of Galicia, who falls in love with Sidonia, daughter of the king of Brittany. The text is associated with the lords of La Tour because it derives the ancestors of that family, whose ancestral possessions were in Brittany, from members of the train of prince Pontus. The story is based on an earlier work, the Anglo-Norman chanson de geste \"Horn et Rimenhild\" (ca. 1180).\n\nSeveral German translations were made during the 15th century (viz., in the period corresponding to the final phase of Middle High German or the formative phase of Early New High German). There is a surviving version in Alemannic German, possibly written in the Old Swiss Confederacy, dated to between 1440 and 1460, and another version in Moselle Franconian, probably written in the region of Trier. Another translation of the French text was made by Eleanor, Archduchess of Austria (1433–1480).\n\nA late medieval Dutch translation \"Die historie van Ponthus ende die schoone Sidonie\" survived in an edition printed by Niclaes vanden Wouwere in Antwerp in 1564.\n\n\n"}

He was a Member of Parliament in three legislations (1990-1991, 2001-2005, 2005–2009) and the first CEE Vice-President of the Atlantic Treaty Association (ATA), Paris (1996-1999) and Chair of the Transparency and Accountability Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of OSCE (2006-2009).\n\nIn the 1980s Passy was active in anti-establishment and pro-democratic movements. He holds a Ph.D. in mathematical logic, entitling him to the honorific title Dr Passy, and was a computer scientist at Sofia University and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1979-1994). Passy and his wife Gergana are co-authors of the EU Universal USB charger for GSM (2008-2014) and he is a pioneer of Bulgaria's Antarctic presence and membership in the Antarctic Treaty.\n\nSolomon Passy was born in Plovdiv. He is the son of Bulgarian philosopher Prof. Isaac Passy and physician, inventor and endocrinologist Lily Passy. He is a mathematician and holds a Ph.D. (1985) in Mathematical Logic and Computer Science from Sofia University. In the 1980s he was involved in the dissident movements opposing the communist regime.\n\nIn 1990 Passy became the founding President and CEO of the Atlantic Club of Bulgaria (ACB), the only NGO operating within Warsaw Pact countries vocally advocating its dissolution, and the accession of New Europe to NATO and the EU. He also co-founded the Green Party serving as its spokesman (1989), the Union of Democratic Forces (1989), the Club for Support of Glasnost and Perestroika of Zhelyu Zhelev (1989), as well as the National Movement Simeon II (2001).\n\nIn the 1980s Passy was an activist of various opposition, underground and ecological movements opposing communism, including in defense of the oppressed Turkish minority in Bulgaria; in solidarity with them he assumed the Turkish pseudonym Syuleyman Tehlikeli when publishing mathematical papers and graphics art in the 1980s.\n\nHe attended the Solidarity Trade Union Congress in Gdansk in the fall of 1981. In May 1987 Passy was the co-host-organizer of the first public opposition happening in Sofia University. After his efforts in communist Bulgaria, in 1990-1991, as MP in the Grand National Assembly, he co-authored the first democratic Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria and tabled the bill for abolishment of the death penalty in Bulgaria.\n\nIn August 1990 Passy, as a Member of Parliament, appealed to the Grand National Assembly and drafted the Parliamentary Bill for the withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and Bulgaria's accession to NATO.\n\nPassy and others founded the ACB, which was succeeded by dozens of other Atlantic NGOs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Asia, and Africa. The logo of the Atlantic Club – the NATO compass rose encircled by the 12 EU stars – became the symbol of unity of the Euro-Atlantic area adopted by number of the emerging Atlantic NGOs.\n\nIn November 1990 the ACB founders led by Passy made the first visit of an East European delegation to NATO HQ by invitation of NATO SG Manfred Wörner and the US Permanent Representative to NATO Ambassador William Taft IV, who supported the Bulgarian idea to establish ACB on a Warsaw Pact territory. Subsequently, the Bulgarian know-how was replicated in a joint statement by US Secretary of State James Baker and the Foreign Minister of Germany Hans-Dietrich Genscher in May 1991 who advocated the creation of Atlantic councils in other Warsaw Pact countries.\n\nIn June 1991 NATO SG Manfred Wörner agreed to be \"kidnapped\" in Sofia by Solomon Passy in his East German car Trabant. Manfred Wörner became a supporter of ACB and personally endorsed in 1992 ACB's accession as first CEE member of ATA. ACB erected a monument in Sofia of him in 1996, which was inaugurated by his successor Javier Solana.\n\nFor 14 years Solomon Passy worked on Bulgaria's membership of NATO, which was finalized on April 2, 2004 when Minister Passy raised the Bulgarian flag over NATO HQ in Brussels.\n\nPassy co-authored the bill concerning Bulgaria’s membership in the EU, adopted by the Grand National Assembly in December 1990. He negotiated as Foreign Minister the EU Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and signed it on April 25, 2005. The Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet was adopted as the third official EU alphabet.\n\nIn September 1990 Passy became co-author of the draft of the Parliamentary Bill for Bulgaria's participation in the US-led coalition that liberated Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's occupation.\n\nPassy proposed in 2003 the creation of joint US-Bulgarian defense facilities in Bulgaria - a project he ratified in 2006 as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Parliamentary Committee.\n\nIn 2001 Bulgaria was elected for rotational member of the UN Security Council (2002-2003); Passy represented Bulgaria on UNSC and chaired the Council in September 2002 and December 2003.\n\nIn 2004 Passy became the OSCE Chairman-in-Office. During his chairmanship the frozen conflict in Ajaria (Georgia) was solved, and Mongolia joined OSCE network.\n\nPassy, Joschka Fischer, and Colin Powell hosted the OSCE Berlin Conference on Antisemitism (April 2004).\n\nWhile Passy was part of King Simeon's Government, constructive and pragmatic relations with Russia were formed, following 45 years of de facto Soviet occupation of Bulgaria. Bilateral relations with China and India were refreshed and the Bulgarian diplomatic network with the Arab countries restored.\n\nSee also: Dr. Solomon Passy and China, Dr. Solomon Passy: Central Asia, Caucasus and Post-Soviet Space (as CiO of the OSCE – 2004), and Memorandum about Relationships between the Holy See and the Atlantic Club of Bulgaria.\n\nAs Minister, Passy was responsible for the strategy of the EU-US-BG negotiating Troika with Libya’s dictator col. Gaddafi for the successful release (July 2007) of six Bulgarian medics held by Libya as hostages in 1999.\n\nOn behalf of the Western Allies Passy, as MP, undertook successful mediation missions in North Korea (July–August 2007), which eventually contributed to the destruction of the cooling tower for heavy water at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center (North Korea) - agreed upon the Six-Party Talks in September 27–30, 2007 - and to Summit meeting between North and South Korea. He mediated for the release of US citizen collaborators of George Soros detained in Iran in May 2007.\n\nIn 2007 Passy assumed a one-year assignment as an advisor to the Macedonian Government on NATO accession. In 2008 the Bucharest Summit of NATO agreed on Macedonia's membership of NATO, conditional on resolving the bilateral dispute with Greece.\n\nIn 2008 the government of Bulgaria nominated Solomon for Secretary General of NATO.\n\nACB is the first non-NATO NGO invited to join the Atlantic Treaty Association, in 1992.

He developed philosophical theory called \"reism\" () and an ethical system called independent ethics. Kotarbiński also contributed significantly to the development of praxeology.\n\nHenryk Greniewski and Kazimierz Pasenkiewicz have been doctoral students of Kotarbiński.\n\nTadeusz Kotarbiński was born on 31 March 1886 in Warsaw, then Congress Poland, Russian Empire, into an artist's family. His father, Miłosz Kotarbiński, was a painter and a pianist composer; his mother, Ewa de domo Koskowska. His uncles were - Józef Kotarbiński, an important figure in Polish theater circles and Wilhelm Kotarbiński - a talented painter. Expelled from secondary school in 1905 for participating in a strike, Kotarbiński managed to graduate two years later. He studied first as an unenrolled student at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, attending mostly lectures on mathematics and physics; then architecture in Lvov and Darmstadt, to finally settle for studies in philosophy and classical philology at the Lvov University. His professors were some of the most esteemed philosophers, logicians and mathematicians of his time: Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Władysław Witwicki and philologist Stanisław Witkowski. He received his PhD degree with the thesis \"Utilitarianism in the ethics of Mill and Spencer\" in 1912.\n\nAfter graduation he first worked as a secondary school classical languages teacher at the Rey Gymnasium in Warsaw. In 1918 Kotarbiński started lecturing career in philosophy at the Warsaw University. In years 1929/1930 he held the position of Dean of Humanities Faculty. After the World War II, alongside other eminent men of learning, he helped to create a state university in Lodz. In 1945 professor Kotarbiński accepted the position of the first rector of the University of Lodz, which he held until 1949 working simultaneously at the University of Warsaw. His model of work became a benchmark for the future generations of scientists and researchers working at the UL.\n\nReism is a pansomatism (from Greek:πᾶν meaning \"all\" and σῶμα - \"body\") ontology as well as semantic theory developed by Kotarbiński and most extensively exposed in his major work: \"Elements of the Theory of Knowledge, Formal Logic and Methodology of the Sciences\", first published in 1929. Kotarbiński was the creator of the term reism - a word derived from the Latin \"res\" meaning \"thing\".\n\nKotarbiński's ontological reism approach assumes that the only things that exist, and thus the only ontological category to be used, are individual, concrete objects (or bodies) in opposition to doctrines allowing for the existence of such categories as universals, states of affairs, properties, relations, sets, classes, mental constructs etc.\n\nIn its sematic formulation Kotarbiński postulated that meaningful sentences have to contain so-called genuine names (referring to concrete objects) as opposed to abstract objects' names or non-genuine names (onomatoids). He also distinguished onomatoids from empty names, which he considered to be reistic. Sentences with onomatoids only were in his view meaningless, whereas those with empty names meaningful.\n\nReism has been anticipated by philosophers preceding Kotarbiński (Leibnitz, Brentano and his pupils and earlier nominalists and materialists), but it was Kotarbiński who developed it to the complete, systematic exposition and gave it its name.\n\nIn 1958 in \"Philosophical Studies\" n4 (7) Kotarbiński published \"Developmental Stages of Concretism\", an essay in which he discussed the construction and evolution of his theory starting from the early concretism or nominalism, passing through seven stages of re-elaboration and finally culminating in pansomatism. Kotarbiński used terms: reism, pansomatism and concretism as equivalents to some extent throughout his works.\n\nKotarbiński was the most prominent representative and promoter of praxeology in Poland. Three years after publishing his major work on the subject: \"A Treatise on Good Work\" he persuaded Polish Academy of Sciences to establish a special unit called \"Workshop for Generic Work Organizational Issues\" (Pracownia Ogólnych Problemów Organizacji Pracy) later expanded into Department of Praxeology. Since 1962 it issued a periodical, called at first \"Praxeological Papers\" (Materiały Prakseologiczne), and then simply \"Praxeology\" (Prakseologia).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11610526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11610526", "title": "Wespazjan Kochowski", "text": "Wespazjan Kochowski\n\nWespazjan (Vespasian) Kochowski (coat of arms: Nieczuja) (1633 in Gaj, a village which no longer exists, near Waśniów in Sandomierz Land – June 6, 1700 in Kraków) was one of the most noted historians and poets of Polish Baroque, the most typical representative of the philosophy and literature of Sarmatism.\n\nKochowski was associated with Małopolska during all his life. His parents were Jan (John), a middle rank nobleman (\"szlachcic\"), and Zofia (Sophie), née Janowski. He studied at the Nowodworski College, in Kraków. Next, during ten years, he fought as Polish winged hussar with Cossacks, Muscovy and Swedish (he took part, among others, in the battle of Beresteczko). In 1660 he came back to paternal Gaj, but he had to move to Goleniowy near Szczekociny in Kraków Land.\n\nHis first publication was a poem entitled \"Kamień świadectwa wielkiego w Koronie Polskiej senatora niewinności\" (\"The Stone of Testimony of the Innocence of the Great Senator of Polish Kingdom\") in the defence of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski. In 1668 he published his first volume, \"Różaniec Najświętszej Panny Maryi\" (\"The Rosary of Holy Virgin Mary\"), which considers each secrets of rosary.\n\nDuring that time, Kochowski was involved in political life (regional councils, state parliaments, local offices), gaining large respect among the nobility. He was even the podżupnik (administrator) of huge salt mines in Wieliczka near Kraków.\n\nIn 1674 he published his first masterpiece — \"Niepróżnujące próżnowanie\" (\"Not idling idleness\"). This is a collection of several hundreds verses, divided in four books of lyrics, one book of epodes and two books of epigrams. He showed the variety of topics, feelings, stylistic figures and versification forms. He expressed the care of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, praised its triumphs, criticised its weaknesses, encouraged compatriots to defence it; he glorified life in the country and his paternal region, thanked God for looking for him and also joked at many ordinary situations in life.\n\nIn 1681 Kochowski also wrote two religious poems: \"Chrystus cierpiący\" (\"Suffering Christ\"), which laments the Passion of Our Lord, and \"Ogród panieński\" (\"Virgin's Garden\"), which explains the titles of Our Lady.\n\nDuring the reign of John III Sobieski he turned towards history. In 1683 he wrote \"Annales Poloniae ab obitu Vladislai IV\" (\"The Annals of Poland from the Death of Ladislas IV\"), commonly called \"Klimaktery\" (\"Climacters\"). This is the history of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth under kings John II Casimir and Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki. Kochowski had used the information from many witnesses, documents and his own experiences and he had done it so well. This book is one of the main sources for the old Polish history.\n\nIn 1683 Kochowski took part in the battle of Vienna as \"historiographus privilegiatus\" (the privileged historian); a position granted to him by king Jan III Sobieski, an admirer of his historian skills. Next year he published the official relation from that – \"Commentarius belli adversus Turcas\" (\"Memoirs from the war against Turks\"). He also tried to make the national epos, but he managed to write only one canto, edited as \"Dzieło Boskie albo Pieśni Wiednia wybawionego\" (\"The Work of God or Songs of Liberated Vienna\", also in 1684.\n\nThe last, most original and interesting piece of Kochowski was \"Trybut należyty wdzięczności wszystkiego dobrego Dawcy, Panu i Bogu albo Psalmodia polska za dobrodziejstwa Boskie dziękująca\" (\"The Appropriate Gift of Gratefulness for the Giver of Everything Good, Lord and God, or Polish Psalmody, Thanking for the God's Benefits\") from 1695, usually called simply \"Psalmodia polska\" (\"The Polish Psalmody\"). It distinguishes itself, on one hand, by the Bible stylization, and on the other hand, by the change of point of view from Hebrew to Pole, from Jew to Christian, from ancient person to modern one. There are mixed 14 private and 22 public psalms. It tells about the expiation and the God's mercy, moderation of greeds and believing in the providence (\"złota mierność\" – \"the golden mean\"), special role of Poland in the world (\"antemurale christianitatis\" – \"the bulwark of Christianity\") and the superiority of Polish political system (\"złota wolność\" – \"the golden liberty\"). \"Psalmodia polska\" is recognized as one of the main monuments of old Polish literature and the best synthesis of Sarmatism.\n\nIn 1658 Kochowski married Marianna (Marianne) Misiowska. They had a son, Hieronim Franciszek (Jerome Francis), as late as 1674. After the death of Marianna in 1677 he married rich widow Magdalena (Madeline) Frezer. In 1696 she also died.\n\nHe was the best friend of Jan Gawiński, which was also a good poet. His friends were also Stefan Bidziński (a well-known soldier), Hieronim Komornicki (abbot of Święty Krzyż) and Pakosław Lanckoroński (a politician).\n\nKochowski was very popular in his time. He was also so popular in the last period of partitions and between the Wars. Last time he is more and more esteemed again.\n\n\n\n\n"}
