{"id": "41986762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41986762", "title": "Akrodha", "text": "Akrodha\n\nAkrodha (Sanskrit: अक्रोध) literally means \"free from anger\". It is considered an important virtue in Indian philosophy.\n\nAkrodha is a fusion word \"a\" (अ, without, non) and \"krodha\" (क्रोध, anger), or 'without anger'. A related word is \"Akrodhah\" (Sanskrit: अक्रोध:), which also means 'absence of anger'.\n\n\"Akrodha\" is considered a virtue and desirable ethical value in Hinduism. When there is cause of getting angry but even then there is absence of anger, it is non-anger or \"akrodha\". Absence of anger (\"akrodha\") means being calm even when insulted, rebuked or despite great provocation. \"Akrodha\" does not mean absence of causes of anger, it means not getting angry and keeping an even, calm temper despite the circumstances.\n\n\"Krodha\" ('anger') is excessive mental turmoil on account of the obstacles in the gratification of some desire; it is manifestation of the quality of tamas (dark, negative, destructive), an undesirable psychological state. The opposite of \"Krodha\" is \"Akrodha\", and this is a productive, positive and constructive state.\n\nBhawuk states that \"akrodha\" is necessary to any process of peace. Peace and happiness is a state of contentment (santustah), where there is absence of spite or envy (advestah), absence of anger (akrodhah), and absence of violence (ahimsa). \"Dharma\" relies on \"Akrodha\", because it creates an environment of serenity, a rational principle of life, and because it is a moral virtue inspired by love.\n\nAccording to Vedic sages, when work becomes akin to a \"yajna\" (a worship ceremony), the effect of that work is transformed into \"apurva\", that is, it becomes something unique, unprecedented and empowering. In contrast, anger clouds reason, which results in the loss of discrimination between right and wrong and virtue and vice. When the discriminating faculty is ruined, the person loses self-identity and the inner good perishes. With freedom from anger, a person reaches an \"apurva\" state.\n\nNarada Parivrajaka Upanishad states the nature of \"akrodha\" for a person who seeks self-knowledge and liberation (kaivalya) as follows,\n\n\"Akrodha\", states Manickam, is related to the concept \"Sahya\" (Sanskrit: सह्य) in the Upanishads. \"Sahya\" means, depending on the context, to bear, endure, suffer, and put up with. The quality to \"Sahya\" is considered an ethical value in Hinduism, not out of weakness to react, but for the cause of the ultimate \"Truth\". It is the attribute by which a person willingly bears negative cognitive inputs in order to \"win over\" the opponent or whatever is offensive, in the pursuit of holding on to Truth, in order to achieve oneness with Brahman, the ultimate Truth. This endurance, this strive to overcome the adversaries, through \"akrodha\" and \"ahimsa\", is recommended as the constructive way in one's pursuit of \"Truth\".\n\nThe Hindu epic Mahabharata repeatedly emphasizes the virtue of \"akrodha\". For example, in Adi Parva, it states\n\nIn Vana Parva, the Mahabharata states\n\nIn Shanti Parva, the Mahabharata states\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita (Slokas XVI.1–3), in the Mahabharata, gives a list of twenty-six divine attributes beginning with \"abhayam\" ('fearlessness') and \"sattva sansuddhih\" ('purity of mind'), ending with \"adroha\" ('bearing enmity to none') and \"naatimaanita\" ('absence of arrogance'):\n\n\"Akrodha\" is one of the twenty six divine attributes a person can have, states Bhagavad Gita.\n\nManu has listed \"Akrodha\" ('absence of anger') among the ten primary virtues. The \"Apastambhadharmasutra\" (I.iii.22) rules that a student be not given to anger, and that a house-holder is required to abstain from anger and abstain from action or words that would provoke someone else to anger (II.xviii.2). The \"Baudhayanadharmasutra\" (I.xv.30) requires a house-holder never to be angry, and the \"Gautamdharmasutra\" (II.13) advises that he must not feel angry. The \"Vashisthadharmasutra\" (IV.4) avers that refraining from anger is a virtue like truthfulness, charity among others.\n\nManu mentions ten \"Dharma Lakshanas\", \"akrodha\" is one of these \"lakshana\" (attribute, sign of a dharmic person). The other nine are: Dhriti (patience), Kshama (forgiveness), Damah (temperance), Asteya (non-stealing), Shaucham (purity), Indriyaigraha (freedom from sensual craving), Dhi (reason), Vidya (knowledge), and Satyam (truth).\n\nThe Shaivite doctrine considers four \"yamas\" for the \"Pashupata\" ascetic who smears on his body \"bhasam\"; the four \"yamas\" are – non-injury, celibacy, truthfulness and non-stealing; the \"niyamas\" consist of non-irritability (\"akrodha\"), attendance on the teachers, purity, lightness of diet and carefulness (\"apramada\"). \"Akrodha\" is a virtue.\n\nHinduism and Buddhism both suggest ten freedoms needed for good life. These are – \"Ahimsa\" ('freedom from violence'), \"Asteya\" ('freedom from want, stealing'), \"Aparigraha\" ('freedom from exploitation'), \"Amritava\" ('freedom from early death') and \"Arogya\" ('freedom from disease'), \"Akrodha\" ('freedom of anger'), \"Jnana\" or \"Vidya\" (\"freedom from ignorance\"), \"Pravrtti\" (\"freedom of conscience\"), \"Abhaya\" ('freedom from fear') and \"Dhrti\" ('freedom from frustration and despair').\n\n"}

{"id": "196809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=196809", "title": "Antoine Destutt de Tracy", "text": "Antoine Destutt de Tracy\n\nAntoine Louis Claude Destutt, comte de Tracy (; 20 July 17549 March 1836) was a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher who coined the term \"ideology\".\n\nThe son of a distinguished soldier, Claude Destutt, he was born in Paris. His family was of Scottish descent, tracing its origin to Walter Stutt, who in 1420 had accompanied the Earls of Buchan and Douglas to the court of France, and whose family afterwards rose to be counts of Tracy. He was educated at home and at the University of Strasbourg, where he was noted for his athletic skill. He went into the army, and when the French Revolution broke out, he took an active part in the provincial assembly of Bourbonnais. Elected a deputy of the nobility to the states-general, he sat alongside his friend, the Marquis de La Fayette. In the spring of 1792, he received the rank of \"maréchal de camp\" in command of the cavalry in the army of the north; but the influence of the extremists becoming predominant he took indefinite leave of absence, and settled at Auteuil, where, with Condorcet and Cabanis, he devoted himself to scientific studies.\n\nUnder the Reign of Terror, he was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year, during which he studied Condillac and Locke, and abandoned the natural sciences for philosophy.\n\nIn 1795, he was named associate of the Institut de France; this was the year when the \"Institut\" was established. On the motion of Cabanis, he was named in the class of the moral and political sciences. He soon began to attract attention by the memoires which he read before his colleagues—papers which formed the first draft of his comprehensive work on ideology, named \"Eléments d'idéologie\". He conceived of ideology as the \"science of ideas.\" The society of \"ideologists\" at Auteuil embraced, besides Cabanis and Tracy, Constantin-François de Chassebœuf, Comte de Volney and Dominique Joseph Garat, professor in the National Institute. Along with some of these colleagues, he was a member of the cultural society \"Les Neuf Sœurs\".\n\nUnder the Empire, Tracy was a member of the senate, but took little part in its deliberations. Under the Restoration he became a peer of France, but protested against the reactionary split of the government, and remained in opposition. In 1808, he was elected a member of the Académie française in place of Cabanis, and in 1832, he was also named a member of the Academy of Moral Sciences on its reorganization. He appeared, however, only once at its conferences, owing to his age and to disappointment at the comparative failure of his work. Destutt de Tracy was one of the principal advocates of liberalism during and after the Revolution. He died in Paris.\n\nDestutt de Tracy was the last eminent representative of the sensualistic school which Condillac founded in France upon a one-sided interpretation of Locke. In full agreement with the materialist views of Cabanis, de Tracy pushed the sensualist principles of Condillac to their most necessary consequences. While the attention of Cabanis was devoted mostly to the physiological side of man, Tracy's interests concerned the then newly determined \"ideological,\" in contrast to \"psychological,\" sides of humanity. His grounding notion of ideology, he frankly stated, fell as \"a part of zoology\" (biology). The four faculties into which de Tracy divides the conscious life—perception, memory, judgment, volition—are all varieties of sensation. Perception is sensation caused by a present affection of the external extremities of the nerves; memory is sensation caused, in the absence of present excitation, by dispositions of the nerves which are the result of past experiences; judgment is the perception of relations between sensations, and is itself a species of sensation, because if we are aware of the sensations we must be aware also of the relations between them; and volition he identifies with the feeling of desire, and is therefore included as a type of sensation.\n\nConsidered for the influences of his philosophy, de Tracy minimally deserves credit for his distinction between active and passive touch, which ultimately fed the development of psychological theories of muscular sense. His account of the notion of external existence, as it derived not from pure sensation, but from the experience of action on the one hand and resistance on the other, stands in this light to be compared with the works of Alexander Bain and later psychologists.\n\nHis chief works are the five-volume \"Eléments d'idéologie\" (1817–1818), the first volume of which was presented as \"Ideology Strictly Defined,\" and which completed the arguments made in earlier completed monographs; \"Commentaire sur l'esprit des lois de Montesquieu\" (1806), and \"Essai sur le génie, et les ouvrages de Montesquieu\" (1808). The fourth volume of the \"Eléments d'idéologie\" the author regarded as the introduction to a \"second\" section of the planned nine-part work, which he titled \"Traité de la volonté\" (\"Treatise on the Will and Its Effects\"). When translated into English, editor Thomas Jefferson retitled the volume \"A Treatise on Political Economy\", which obscured the aspects of Tracy's concern not with politics, but with far more basic questions of will, and the possibility of understanding the conditions of its determinations.\n\nTracy advanced a rigorous use of deductive method in social theory, seeing economics in terms of actions (praxeology) and exchanges (catallactics). Tracy's influence can be seen both on the Continent, particularly on Stendhal, Augustin Thierry, Auguste Comte, and Charles Dunoyer, and in America, where the general approach of the French Liberal School of political economy competed evenly with British classical political economy well until the end of the 19th century, as evidence in the work and reputation of Arthur Latham Perry and others. In his political writings, Tracy rejected monarchism, favoring the American republican form of government. This republicanism, as well as his advocacy of reason in philosophy and laissez-faire for economic policy, lost him favor with Napoleon, who turned Tracy's coinage of \"ideology\" into a term of abuse; Karl Marx followed this vein of invective to refer to Tracy as a \"fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär\"—a \"fish-blooded bourgeois doctrinaire.\"\n\nThomas Jefferson, on the other hand, thought highly enough of Destutt de Tracy's work to ready two of his manuscripts for American publication. In his preface to the 1817 publication, Jefferson wrote, \"By diffusing sound principles of Political Economy, it will protect the public industry from the parasite institutions now consuming it. . . .\" Tracy's criticism of Montesquieu and his endorsement of representative democracy were influential on Jefferson's thinking.\n\nStendhal was much influenced by de Tracy's enlightenment ideals, and attended the de Tracy salon regularly, in the 1820s, as he described in \"Memoirs of an Egotist\". Destutt de Tracy was important to the liberals of the 1820s; Richard Stites writes:\n\nFranco Venturi noted that the \"Commentary\" \"resounded throughout the whole period of the liberal revolutions, from the Spain of 1820 to the Russia of 1825.\" An American historian wrote that \"the Russian Decembrists, along with numerous other liberals, \"Carbonari\", and revolutionaries of the 1820s used this \"Commentary\" as their political Bible.\" The Decembrist Mikhail Orlov recalled that his circle considered it \"the epitome of wisdom.\"\n\nHis legacy left lessons for coming generations\n\n\n\n"}

The theory was first described by William Bateson in 1909, then independently described by Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1934, and later elaborated in different forms by Herman Muller, H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets.\n\nThe model states that genetic incompatibility is most likely evolved by alternative fixation of two or more loci instead of just one, so that when hybridization occurs, it is the first time for some of the alleles to co-occur in the same individual. For example, imagine two populations that only recently separated geographically. Both sides are starting with the same genotype \"AABB\". One population can then evolve to \"aaBB\", through the transition state \"AaBB\", while the other evolves to \"AAbb\", through the transition state \"AABb\". During these processes, \"a\" allele will co-occur with \"A\" and \"B\" alleles, and \"b\" will co-occur with \"A\" and \"B\" alleles, without fitness consequences.

{"id": "690464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690464", "title": "Buddha-nature", "text": "Buddha-nature\n\nBuddha-nature or Buddha Principle refers to several related terms, most notably \"tathāgatagarbha\" and \"buddhadhātu\". \"Tathāgatagarbha\" means \"the womb\" or \"embryo\" (\"garbha\") of the \"thus-gone\" (\"tathagata\"), or \"containing a tathagata\", while \"buddhadhātu\" literally means \"Buddha-realm\" or \"Buddha-substrate\".\n\n\"Tathāgatagarbha\" has a wide range of (sometimes conflicting) meanings in Indian and later East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist literature. Debates on what the term means continues to be a major part of Mahayana Buddhist scholastics.\n\nFor example, the Tibetan scholar Go Lotsawa outlined four meanings of the term \"Tathāgatagarbha\" as used by Indian Buddhist scholars generally: (1) As an emptiness that is a nonimplicative negation, (2) the luminous nature of the mind, (3) alaya-vijñana (store-consciousness), (4) all bodhisattvas and sentient beings.\n\nThe term \"tathāgatagarbha\" may mean \"embryonic tathāgata\", \"womb of the tathāgata\", or \"containing a tathagata\". Various meanings may all be brought into mind when the term \"tathagatagarbha\" is being used.\n\nThe Sanskrit term \"tathāgatagarbha\" is a compound of two terms, \"tathāgata\" and \"garbha\":\n\nThe Chinese translated the term \"tathāgatagarbha\" as (, or \"Tathāgata's (\"rúlái\") storehouse\" (\"zàng\"). According to Brown, \"storehouse\" may indicate both \"that which enfolds or contains something\", or \"that which is itself enfolded, hidden or contained by another.\" The Tibetan translation is \"de bzhin gsegs pa'i snyin po\", which cannot be translated as \"womb\" (\"mngal\" or \"lhums\"), but as \"embryonic essence\", \"kernel\" or \"heart\". The term \"heart\" was also used by Mongolian translators.\n\nThe term \"tathagatagarbha\" is translated and interpreted in various ways by western translators and scholars:\n\nThe term \"Buddha-nature\" (, ) is closely related in meaning to the term \"tathāgatagarbha\", but is not a translation of this term. It refers to what is essential in the human being.\n\nThe corresponding Sanskrit term is \"buddhadhātu\". It has two meanings, namely the nature of the Buddha, equivalent to the term dharmakāya, and the cause of the Buddha. The link between the cause and the result is the nature (\"dhātu\") which is common to both, namely the dharmadhātu.\n\nMatsumoto Shirō also points out that \"Buddha-nature\" translates the Sanskrit-term buddhadhātu, a \"place to put something,\" a \"foundation,\" a \"locus.\" According to Shirō, it does not mean \"original nature\" or \"essence,\" nor does it mean the \"possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood,\" \"the original nature of the Buddha,\" or \"the essence of the Buddha.\"\n\nIn the Vajrayana, the term for Buddha-nature is \"sugatagarbha\".\n\nAccording to Wayman, the idea of the tathagatagarbha is grounded on sayings by the Buddha that there is something called the luminous mind (\"prabhasvara citta\"), \"which is only adventitiously covered over by defilements (agantukaklesa)\" The luminous mind is mentioned in a passage from the Anguttara Nikaya: \"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements.\" The Mahāsāṃghika school coupled this idea of the luminous mind with the idea of the mulavijnana, the substratum consciousness that serves as the basis consciousness.\n\nFrom the idea of the luminous mind emerged the idea that the awakened mind is the pure (\"visuddhi\"), undefiled mind. In the tathagatagarbha-sutras it is this pure consciousness that is regarded to be the seed from which Buddhahood grows:\nKarl Brunnholzl writes that the first probable mention of the term is in the \"Ekottarika Agama\" (though here it is used in a different way then in later texts). The passage states:If someone devotes himself to the Ekottarikagama, Then he has the \"tathagatagarbha\". Even if his body cannot exhaust defilements in this life, In his next life he will attain supreme wisdom.This tathāgatagarbha idea was the result of an interplay between various strands of Buddhist thought, on the nature of human consciousness and the means of awakening. Gregory comments on this origin of the Tathagatagarba-doctrine: \"The implication of this doctrine [...] is that enlightenment is the natural and true state of the mind.\"\n\nAccording to Wayman, the \"Avataṃsaka Sūtra\" (1st-3rd century CE) was the next step in the development of the Buddha-nature thought after the concept of the luminous mind:\nThe \"Avataṃsaka Sūtra\" does not contain a \"singular discussion of the concept\", but the idea of \"a universal penetration of sentient beings by the wisdom of the Buddha (\"buddhajñāna\")\" was complementary to the concept of the Buddha-womb.\nThe basic idea of the \"Avataṃsaka Sūtra \" is the unity of the absolute and the relative:\n\nAll levels of reality are related and interpenetrated. This is depicted in the image of Indra's net. This \"unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an inherent nature to anything\".\n\nThe \"Lotus Sutra (\"Skt\": Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra)\", written between 100 BCE and 200 CE, does not mention Buddha-nature, but shares other themes and ideas with the later tathāgatagarbha sūtras like the \"tathāgatagarbha sūtra\" and some scholars theorize that it was an influence on these texts.\n\nThe tenth chapter emphasizes, in accordance with the Bodhisattva-ideal of the Mahayana teachings, that everyone can be liberated. All living beings can become a buddha, not only monks and nuns, but also laypeople, śrāvakas, bodhisattvas, and non-human creatures. It also details that all living beings can be a 'teacher of the Dharma'.\n\nThe twelfth chapter of the \"Lotus Sutra\" details that the potential to become enlightened is universal among all people, even the historical Devadatta has the potential to become a buddha. The story of Devadatta is followed by another story about a dragon princess who is both a nāga and a female, whom the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī proclaims will reach enlightenment immediately, in her present form.\n\nThere are several major Indian texts which discuss the idea of Buddha-nature and they are often termed the tathāgatagarbha sūtras. According to Brunnholzl \"the earliest mahayana sutras that are based on and discuss the notion of tathagatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century.\" Their ideas became very influential in East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. Mahayana sutras which mention this doctrine include the \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtra\", \"Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa,\" \"Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra,\" \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra\" and the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra.\"\n\nThe \"Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra\" (200-250 CE) is considered (...) \"the earliest expression of this (the tathāgatagarbha doctrine) and the term \"tathāgatagarbha\" itself seems to have been coined in this very sutra.\" It states that one is already or primordially awakened and that all beings already have perfect buddhahood within themselves but do not recognize it because it is covered over by afflictions.\n\nAnother one of these texts, the \"Ghanavyuha Sutra\" (as quoted by Longchenpa) states that the tathāgatagarbha is the ground of all things:\n\nThe \"Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra\" (3rd century CE), also named \"The Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala\", centers on the teaching of the tathagatagarbha as \"ultimate soteriological principle\". Regarding the tathāgatagarbha, it states:\n\nIn the \"Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra\" there are two possible states for the tathāgatagarbha:\n\nThe sutra itself states it this way:\n\nThe early Buddha-nature concept as expressed in the seminal 'tathagatagarbha sutra' named the \"Nirvana Sutra\" is, according to Kevin Trainor, as follows: \"Sentient beings are said to possess a sacred nature that is the basis for them becoming buddhas [...] this buddha-nature is in fact our true nature [...] universal and completely unsullied by whatever psychological and karmic state an individual may be in.\"\n\nThe \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" (written 2nd century CE) was very influential in the Chinese reception of the Buddhist teachings. The \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" linked the concept of tathāgatagarbha with the buddhadhātu. Kosho Yamamoto points out that the \"Nirvana Sutra\" contains a series of equations: \"Thus, there comes about the equation of: Buddha Body <nowiki>=</nowiki> Dharmakaya <nowiki>=</nowiki> eternal body <nowiki>=</nowiki> eternal Buddha <nowiki>=</nowiki> Eternity.\" According to Shimoda Masahiro, the authors of the \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" were leaders and advocates of stupa worship. The term \"buddhadhātu\" originally referred to relics. In the \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\", it came to be used in place of the concept of \"tathāgatagārbha\". The authors used the teachings of the \"Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra\" to reshape the worship of the physical relics of the Buddha into worship of the inner Buddha as a principle of salvation. Sasaki, in a review of Shimoda, conveys a key premise of Shimoda's work, namely, that the origins of Mahayana Buddhism and the \"Nirvana Sutra\" are entwined.\n\nThe Buddha-nature is always present, in all times and in all beings. This does not mean that sentient beings are at present endowed with the qualities of a Buddha, but that they will have those qualities in the future. It is obscured from worldly vision by the screening effect of tenacious negative mental afflictions within each being. Once these negative mental states have been eliminated, however, the Buddha-dhatu is said to shine forth unimpededly and the Buddha-sphere (Buddha-dhatu/ visaya) can then be consciously \"entered into\", and therewith deathless Nirvana attained:\n\nAccording to Sallie B. King, it does not represent a major innovation, and is rather unsystematic, which made it \"a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text\". According to King, its most important innovation is the linking of the term \"buddhadhatu\" with \"tathagatagarbha\". The sutra presents the Buddha-nature or tathagatagarbha as a \"Self\". The \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" refers to a true self. \"The \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṅa Sūtra\", especially influential in East Asian Buddhist thought, goes so far as to speak of it as our true self (ātman). Its precise metaphysical and ontological status is, however, open to interpretation in the terms of different Mahāyāna philosophical schools; for the Madhyamikas it must be empty of its own existence like everything else; for the Yogacarins, following the Laṅkāvatāra, it can be identified with store consciousness, as the receptacle of the seeds of awakening. Paul Williams states: \"[...] it is obvious that the \"Mahaparinirvana Sutra\" does not consider it impossible for a Buddhist to affirm an atman provided it is clear what the correct understanding of this concept is, and indeed the sutra clearly sees certain advantages in doing so.\" but it speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text. Paul Williams also notes:\n\nThe \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" (compiled 350-400 CE) synthesized the tathagatagarba-doctrine and the ālāya-vijñāna doctrine. The Lankavatara Sutra \"assimilates Tathagata-garbha thought to the Yogacara-viewpoint, and this assimilation is further developed in [...] The Treatise on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana\". According to the Lankavatara Sutra \"tathāgatagarbha\" is identical to the \"ālaya-vijñāna\", known prior to awakening as the storehouse-consciousness or 8th consciousness. The ālāya-vijñāna is supposed to contain the pure seed, or tathagatagarbha, from which awakening arises.\n\nThe Lankavatara-sutra contains tathagata-garba thought, but also warns against reification of the idea of Buddha-nature, and presents it as an aid to attaining awakening:\n\nAccording to Alex and Hideko Wayman, the equation of tathagatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna in the Lankavatara fails:\n\nThe \"tathāgatagarbha\" doctrine was also widely discussed by Indian Mahayana scholars in treatises or commentaries, called śāstra, the most influential of which was the Ratnagotravibhāga (5th century CE).\n\nThe Ratnagotravibhāga, also called \"Uttaratantraśāstra\" (5th century CE), is an Indian śāstra in which synthesised all the major elements and themes of the tathāgatagārbha theory. It gives an overview of authoritative tathāgatagarbha sutras, mentioning the \"Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra\", the \"Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra\", \"Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\", the \"Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra\", the \"Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa\" and the \"Mahābherīharaka-sūtra\". It presents the tathāgatagarbha as \"an ultimate, unconditional reality that is simultaneously the inherent, dynamic process towards its complete manifestation\". Mundane and enlightened reality are seen as complementary:\n\nIn the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\", the tathāgatagarbha is seen as having three specific characteristics: (1) dharmakaya, (2) suchness, and (3) disposition, as well as the general characteristic (4) non-conceptuality.\n\nAccording to the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\", all sentient beings have \"the embryo of the Tathagata\" in three senses:\n\n\nThe Ratnagotravibhāga equates enlightenment with the nirvāṇa-realm and the dharmakāya. It gives a variety of synonyms for \"garbha\", the most frequently used being \"gotra\" and \"dhatu\".\n\nThis text also explains the tathāgatagarbha in terms of luminous mind:The luminous nature of the mind Is unchanging, just like space.\n\nIndian Madhyamaka philosophers interpreted the theory as a description of emptiness and as a non implicative negation. Bhaviveka's \"Tarkajvala\" states:[The expression] “possessing the tathagata heart” is [used] because emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, and so on, exist in the mind streams of all sentient beings. However, it is not something like a permanent and all-pervasive person that is the inner agent. For we find [passages] such as “All phenomena have the nature of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. What is emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness is the Tathagata.”Candrakirti's \"Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya\" states:One should know that since [the alaya-consciousness] follows the nature of all entities, it is nothing but emptiness that is taught through the term “alaya-consciousness.”Go Lotsawa states that this statement is referencing the tathāgatagarbha doctrine. Candrakirti's \"Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya\" also argues, basing itself on the Lankavatara sutra, that \"the statement of the emptiness of sentient beings being a buddha adorned with all major and minor marks is of expedient meaning\".\n\nKamalasila's (c. 740-795) \"Madhyamakaloka\" associates tathāgatagarbha with luminosity and luminosity with emptiness:This statement “All sentient beings possess the tathāgata heart” teaches that all are suitable to attain the state of unsurpassable completely perfect awakening since it is held that the term tathāgata expresses that the dharmadhātu, which is characterized by personal and phenomenal identitylessness, is natural luminosity.Uniquely among Madhyamaka texts, some texts attributed to Nagarjuna, mainly poetic works like the \"Dharmadhatustava, Cittavajrastava\", and \"Bodhicittavivarana\" associate the term tathāgatagarbha with the luminous nature of the mind.\n\nAccording to Brunnholzl, \"all early Indian Yogacara masters (such as Asanga, Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, and Asvabhava), if they refer to the term tathāgatagarbha at all, always explain it as nothing but suchness in the sense of twofold identitylessness\".\n\nSome later Yogacara scholars spoke of the tathāgatagarbha in more positive terms, such as Jñanasrimitra who in his \"Sakarasiddhi\" equates it with the appearances of lucidity (prakasarupa). Likewise, Brunnholzl notes that \"Ratnakarasanti generally describes the tathagata heart as being equivalent to naturally luminous mind, nondual self-awareness, and the perfect nature (which he considers to be an implicative negation and not a nonimplicative negation).\"\n\nThe Yogacara concept of the alaya-vijñana (store consciousness) also came to be associated by some scholars with the tathāgatagarbha. This can be seen in sutras like the Lankavatara, the Srimaladevi and in the translations of Paramartha. The concept of the ālaya-vijñāna originally meant defiled consciousness: defiled by the workings of the five senses and the mind. It was also seen as the mūla-vijñāna, the base-consciousness or \"stream of consciousness\" from which awareness and perception spring.\n\nTo account for the notion of Buddha-nature in all beings, with the Yogacara belief in the Five Categories of Beings, Yogacara scholars in China such as Tz'u-en (慈恩, 632-682) the first patriarch in China, advocated two types of nature: the latent nature found in all beings (理佛性) and the Buddha-nature in practice (行佛性). The latter nature was determined by the innate seeds in the alaya.\n\nAround 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the Trikaya or \"three-body doctrine\". According to this doctrine, Buddhahood has three aspects:\n\nThey may be described as follows:\nThe tathāgatagarbha idea was extremely influential in the development of East Asian Buddhism. When Buddhism was introduced to China, in the 1st century CE, Buddhism was understood through comparisons of its teachings to Chinese terms and ways of thinking. Chinese Buddhist thinkers like Zhi Mindu, Zhidun, and Huiyuan (d. 433) interpreted Buddhist concepts in terms of the Chinese neo-daoist philosophy called ‘dark learning’ (\"xuanxue\"). This tendency was only later countered by the work of Chinese Madhyamaka scholar-translators like Kumarajiva.\n\nThe buddha nature idea was introduced into China with the translation of the Mahaparanirvana sutra in the early fifth century and this text became the central source of buddha nature doctrine in Chinese Buddhism. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra some Chinese Buddhists supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths. This idea was interpreted as being similar to the ideas of Dao and Principle (Li) in Chinese philosophy.\n\nThe Awakening of Faith was very influential in the development of Chinese Buddhism said to have been translated by Paramartha (499-569). While the text is traditionally attributed to , no Sanskrit version of the text is extant. The earliest known versions are written in Chinese, and contemporary scholars believe that the text is a Chinese composition.\n\nThe \"Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana\" offers a synthesis of Chinese buddhist thinking. It sees the Buddha-nature doctrine as a cosmological theory, in contrast to the Indo-Tibetan tradition, where the soteriological aspect is emphasized. It described the \"One Mind\" which \"includes in itself all states of being of the phenomenal and transcendental world\". It tried to harmonize the ideas of the tathāgatagarbha and ālāya-vijñāna:\nIn the Awakening of Faith the 'one mind' has two aspects, namely tathata, suchness, the things as they are, and samsara, the cycle of birth and death. This text was in line with an essay by Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty (reign 502-549 CE), in which he postulated a pure essence, the enlightened mind, trapped in darkness, which is ignorance. By this ignorance the pure mind is trapped in samsara. This resembles the tathāgatagarba and the idea of the defilement of the luminous mind. In a commentary on this essay Shen Yue stated that insight into this true essence is awakened by stopping the thoughts - a point of view which is also being found in the \"Platform Sutra\" of Huineng.\n\nThe joining together of these different ideas supported the notion of the ekayāna, the one vehicle: absolute oneness, all-pervading Buddha-wisdom and original enlightenment as a holistic whole. This synthesis was a reflection of the unity which was attained in China with the united Song dynasty.\n\nBy the 6th century CE buddha nature had been well established in Chinese Buddhism and a wide variety of theories developed to explain it. One influential figure who wrote about buddha nature was Ching-ying Hui-yuan (523-592 CE), a Chinese Yogacarin who argued for a kind of idealism which held that: \"All dharmas without exception originate and are formed from the true[-mind], and other than the true[-mind], there exists absolutely nothing which can give rise to false thoughts.\" Ching-ying Hui-yuan equated this 'true mind' with the alaya-vijñana, the tathāgatagarbha and \"Buddha-nature\" (\"fóxìng\") and held that it was an essence, a true consciousness and a metaphysical principle that ensured that all sentient beings will reach enlightenment. According to Ming-Wood Liu \"Hui-yuan's interpretation of the Buddha-nature doctrine represents the culmination of a long process of transformation of the \"Buddha-nature\" from a basically practical to an ontological concept.\"\n\nThe Chinese Yogacara school was also split on the relationship between the tathāgatagarbha and ālayavijñāna. Fa-shang (495-580), representing the southern Yogacara, asserted that they were separate, that the alaya was illusiory and impure while buddha nature was the ultimate source of all phenomenal reality. In the northern school meanwhile, it was held that the alaya and buddha nature were the same pure support for all phenomena. In the sixth and seventh centuries, the Yogacara theory became associated with a substantialist non-dual metaphysics which saw buddha nature as an eternalistic ground. This idea was promoted by figures like Fazang and Ratnamati.\n\nIn contrast with the Chinese Yogacara view, the Chinese Madhyamaka scholar Jizang (549–623 CE) sought to remove all ontological connotations of the term as a metaphysical reality and saw buddha nature as being synonymous with terms like \"tathata,\" \"dharmadhatu,\" \"ekayana,\" \"wisdom, <nowiki>\"</nowiki> \"ultimate reality,\" \"middle way\" and also the wisdom that contemplates dependent origination. In formulating his view, Jizang was influenced by the earlier Chinese Madhyamaka thinker Sengzhao (384–414 CE) who was a key figure in outlining an understanding of emptiness which was based on the Indian sources and not on Daoist concepts which previous Chinese Buddhists had used. Jizang used the compound “Middle Way-buddha nature” (\"zhongdao foxing\" 中道佛 性) to refer to his view. Jizang was also one of the first Chinese philosophers to famously argue that plants and insentient objects have Buddha nature, which he also termed true reality and universal principle (\"dao\").\n\nIn the 20th century, the influential Chinese master Yin Shun drew on Chinese Madhyamaka to argue against any Yogacara influenced view that buddha nature was an underlying permanent ground of reality and instead supported the view that buddha nature teachings are just an expedient means. Yin Shun, drawing on his study of Indian Madhyamaka promoted the emptiness of all things as the ultimate Buddhist truth, and argued that the buddha nature teaching was a provisional teaching taught in order to ease the fear of some Buddhists regarding emptiness as well as to attract those people who have an affinity to the idea of a Self or Brahman. Later after taking up the Buddhist path, they would be introduced to the truth of emptiness.\n\nIn the Tiantai school, the primary figure is the scholar Zhiyi. According to Paul L. Swanson, none of Zhiyi's works discuss buddha nature explicitly at length however. Yet it is still an important concept in his philosophy, which is seen as synonymous with the ekayana principle outlined in the Lotus Sutra. Swanson argues that for Zhiyi, buddha nature is:an active threefold process which involves the way reality is, the wisdom to see reality as it is, and the practice required to attain this wisdom. Buddha Nature is threefold: the three aspects of reality, wisdom, and practice are interdependent--one aspect does not make any sense without the others.Buddha nature for Zhiyi therefore has three aspects which he bases on passages from the Lotus sutra and the Nirvana sutra:\n\n\nThe later Tiantai scholar Zhanran would expand the Tiantai view of buddha nature, which he saw as synonymous with suchness, to argue for the idea that insentient rocks and plants also have buddha nature.\n\nIn Chan Buddhism, buddha nature tends to be seen as the (non-substantial) essential nature of all beings. But the Zen tradition also emphasizes that buddha nature is śūnyatā, the absence of an independent and substantial \"self\".\n\nChan masters from Huineng in 7th-century China to Hakuin Ekaku in 18th-century Japan to Hsu Yun in 20th-century China, have all taught that the process of awakening begins with the light of the mind turning around within the 8th consciousness, so that the \"ālayavijñāna\", also known as the \"tathāgatagarbha\", is transformed into the \"bright mirror wisdom\". The \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" presents the Chan/Zen Buddhist view of the \"tathāgatagarbha\":\nWhen this active transformation is complete, the other seven consciousnesses are also transformed. The 7th consciousness of delusive discrimination becomes transformed into the \"equality wisdom\". The 6th consciousness of thinking sense becomes transformed into the \"profound observing wisdom\", and the 1st to 5th consciousnesses of the five sensory senses become transformed into the \"all-performing wisdom\".\n\nThe Chan master Mazu Daoyi (709–788) developed a radical interpretation of buddha nature, famously stating that it was nothing less than ordinary mind and that all beings were already enlightened from the start.\n\nThe influential Chan patriarch Guifeng Zongmi (780–841) interpreted Buddha nature as “empty tranquil awareness” (\"k’ung-chi chih\"), which he took from the Ho-tse school of Chan. Following the Srimala sutra, he interpreted the theory of emptiness as presented in the Prajñaparamita sutras as provisional and saw buddha nature as the definitive teaching of Buddhism.\n\nAccording to Heng-Ching Shih, the teaching of the universal Buddha-nature does not intend to assert the existence of substantial, entity-like self endowed with excellent features of a Buddha. Rather, Buddha-nature simply represents the potentiality to be realized in the future.\n\nHsing Yun, forty-eighth patriarch of the Linji school, equates the Buddha-nature with the dharmakāya in line with pronouncements in key tathāgatagarbha sūtras. He defines these two as:\nIn the Korean \"Vajrasamādhi Sūtra\" (685 CE), the tathāgatagarbha is presented as being possessed of two elements, one essential, immutable, changeless and still, the other active and salvational:\n\nNichiren (1222–1282) was a Buddhist monk who taught devotion to the \"Lotus Sutra\" as the exclusive means to attain enlightenment, and the chanting of Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō as the essential practice of the teaching. Nichiren Buddhism includes various schools with diverging interpretations of Nichiren's teachings.\n\nNichiren Buddhism views the Buddha nature as \"The inner potential for attaining Buddhahood\", common to all people.\nBased on the \"Lotus Sutra\", Nichiren maintained that \"all living being possess the Buddha nature\", being the inherent potential to attain Buddhahood: \"The Buddha nature refers to the potential for attaining Buddhahood, a state of awakening filled with compassion and wisdom.\"\n\nThe emphasis in Nichiren Buddhism is on \"revealing the Buddha nature\" - or attaining Buddhahood – in this lifetime through chanting the name of the Dharma of the Lotus Sutra: \"[T]the Buddha nature within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\"\n\nThe potential for Buddhahood exists in the whole spectrum of the Ten Worlds of life, and this means that all people, including evil doers, have Buddha nature, which remains as a dormant possibility or a theoretical potential in the field of emptiness or non-substantiality until it is materialized in reality through Buddhist practice.\n\nIn his letter \"Opening the Eyes of Wooden and painted Images\" Nichiren explains that insentient matter (such as trees, mandalas, images, statues) also possess the Buddha nature, because they serve as objects of worship. This view regards the Buddha nature as the original nature of all manifestations of life – sentient and insentient – through their interconnectedness:\nThe founder of the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism, Dōgen Zenji, held that Buddha-nature (\"busshō\" 佛性) was simply the true nature of reality and Being. This true nature was just impermanence, becoming and 'vast emptiness'. Because he saw the whole universe as an expression of Buddha-nature, he held that even grass and trees are Buddha nature. \nTherefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.\n\nThe founder of Sanbō Kyōdan lineage of Zen Buddhism, Yasutani Haku'un Roshi, also defined Buddha-nature in terms of the emptiness and impermanence of all dharmas:\nA famous reference to Buddha-nature in the Zen-tradition is the Mu-koan:\nThe founder of the Jōdo Shinshū of Pure Land Buddhism, Shinran, equated Buddha-Nature with shinjin.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhist scholastics, there are two main camps of interpreting buddha nature. There are those who argue that \"tathāgatagarbha\" is just emptiness (described either as dharmadhatu, the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation) and there are those who see it as the union of the mind's emptiness and luminosity (which includes the buddha qualities).\n\nThe Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism favors what is called the \"rangtong\" interpretation of Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka philosophy. They thus interpret Buddha nature as an expedient term for the emptiness of inherent existence. Other schools, especially the Jonang, and Kagyu have tended to accept the shentong, \"other-empty\", Madhyamaka philosophy, which discerns an Absolute which \"is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is not empty of its own inherent existence\".\n\nThese interpretations of the tathagatagarbha-teachings has been a matter of intensive debates in Tibet.\n\nAn early Tibetan translator, Ngok Lotsawa (1050-1109) argues in his commentary to the Uttaratantra that Buddha nature is a non-implicative negation, which is to say that it is emptiness, as a \"total negation\" of inherent existence (\"svabhava\") that does not imply that anything is left un-negated (in terms of its \"svabhava\"). Another early figure, Chaba Chokyi Senge also argued that Buddha nature was a non-implicative negation. The Kadampa tradition generally followed Ngok Lotsawa by holding that Buddha nature was a nonimplicative negation. The Gelug school, which sees itself as a continuation of the Kadampas, also hold this view, while also holding, as Chaba did, that Buddha nature teachings are of expedient meaning.\n\nKedrub Jé Geleg Balsang (1385-1438), one of the main disciples of Tsongkhapa, defined the tathāgatagarbha thus:\"It is the emptiness of mind’s being empty of being really established that is called “the naturally pure true nature of the mind.” The naturally pure true nature of the mind in its phase of not being free from adventitious stains is called “sugata heart” or “naturally abiding disposition.\"Brunnholzl states that the view of Gyaltsab Darma Rinchen (1364-1432) is \"that the tathàgata heart is the state of a being in whom mind's emptiness is obscured, while buddhas by definition do not possess this tathàgata heart.\"\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama sees the Buddha-nature as the \"original clear light of mind\", but points out that it ultimately does not exist independently, because, like all other phenomena, it is of the nature of emptiness:\nSakya Pandita (1182-1251) sees the buddha nature as the dharmadhatu free from all reference points, and states that the teaching that buddha nature exists in all beings is of expedient meaning and that its basis is emptiness, citing Candrakirti's \"Madhyamakāvatārabhāsya\". The Sakya scholar Rongtön meanwhile, argued that buddha nature is suchness, with stains, or emptiness of the mind with stains.\n\nSakya scholar Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364), like the Gelugpas, held that the Buddha nature teachings were of expedient meaning and that that the naturally abiding disposition is nothing but emptiness, however unlike them, his view was that the basis for these teachings is the alaya-vijñana and also that buddha nature is the dharmakaya of a buddha but \"never exists in the great mass of sentient beings\".\n\nAccording to Brunnholzl, in the works of the influential Sakya scholar Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429-1489), buddha nature is \"nondual unity of minds lucidity and emptiness or awareness and emptiness free from all reference points. It is not mere emptiness because sheer emptiness cannot be the basis of both samsára and nirvána. However, it is not mere lucidity either because this lucidity is a conditioned entity and the tathágata heart is unconditioned.\"\n\nSakya Chokden meanwhile argues that the ultimate buddha nature is \"minds natural luminosity free from all extremes of reference points, which is the sphere of personally experienced wisdom and an implicative negation.\"\n\nThe Jonang school, whose foremost historical figure was the Tibetan scholar-monk Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), sees the Buddha-nature as the very ground of the Buddha himself, as the \"permanent indwelling of the Buddha in the basal state\". According to Brunnholzl, Dolpopa, basing himself on certain \"tathāgatagarbha\" sutras, argued that the buddha nature is \"ultimately really established, everlasting, eternal, permanent, immutable (therzug), and being beyond dependent origination.\" This is the foundation of what is called the Shentong view.\n\nMoreover, the Buddhist tantric scripture entitled \"Chanting the Names of Mañjuśrī ()\", repeatedly exalts, as portrayed by Dolpopa, not the non-Self but the Self, and applies the following terms to this ultimate reality : 'The Buddha-Self, the beginningless Self, the solid Self, the diamond Self'. These terms are applied in a manner which reflects the cataphatic approach to Buddhism, typical of much of Dolpopa's writings.\n\nDr. Cyrus Stearns writes that Dolpopa's attitude to the 'third turning of the wheel' doctrines (i.e. the Buddha-nature teachings) is that they \"are the final definitive statements on the nature of ultimate reality, the primordial ground or substratum beyond the chain of dependent origination, and which is only empty of other, relative phenomena.\"\n\nIn the Nyingma school doctrines on buddha nature are generally marked by the tendency to align the idea with Dzogchen views as well as with Prasangika Madhyamaka, beginning with the work of Rongzom (1042-1136) and continuing into the work of Longchenpa (1308-1364) and Mipham (1846- 1912). Mipham Rinpoche, the most authoritative figure in modern Nyingma, adopted a view of buddha nature as the unity of appearance and emptiness, relating it to the descriptions of the Ground in Dzogchen as outlined by Longchenpa. This ground is said to be primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (Ihun grub).\n\nGermano writes that Dzogchen \"represents the most sophisticated interpretation of the so-called \"Buddha nature\" tradition within the context of Indo-Tibetan thought\".\n\nThe 19th/20th-century Nyingma scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha nature as ultimate truth, nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:\n\nTulku Urgyen Rinpoche sees an identity between the Buddha-nature, dharmadhātu (essence of all phenomena and the noumenon) and the Three Vajras, saying:\nThe Nyingma meditation masters, Khenchen Palden Sherab and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal, emphasise that the essential nature of the mind (the Buddha-nature) is not a blankness, but is characterized by wonderful qualities and a non-conceptual perfection that is already present and complete, it's just obscured and we fail to recognize it.\n\nSpeaking in the context of Nyingma, Dzogchen Ponlop expresses the view that there exists within vajrayana Buddhism the doctrine that we are already buddha: ‘... in the vajrayana, we are buddha \"right now\", in this very moment’ and that it is legitimate to have ‘vajra pride’ in our buddha mind and the already present qualities of enlightenment with which it is replete:\nAccording to Brunnholzl,Virtually all Kagyu masters hold the teaching on buddha nature to be of definitive meaning and deny that the tathagata heart is just sheer emptiness or a nonimplicative negation. Though the Kagyu approach has certain similarities with Dolpopa's view, it is generally less absolute than the latter's and shows several significant differences, such as not claiming that the buddha qualities exist in their full-blown form even in confused sentient beings and not making such an absolute distinction between the two realities as Dolpopa does (the exception is Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye, who largely follows Taranatha and Dolpopa but at times blends their positions with the Third Karmapa's view).In Kagyu the view of the Third Karmapa is generally seen as the most authoritative. This is the view that buddha nature is \"mind's luminous ultimate nature or nondual wisdom, which is the basis of everything in samsara and nirvana.\"\nThrangu Rinpoche sees the Buddha nature as the indivisible oneness of wisdom and emptiness:\nThe Rimé movement is an ecumenical movement in Tibet which started as an attempt to reconcile the various Tibetan schools in the 19th century. In contrast to the Gelugpa, which adheres to the \"rang stong\", \"self-empty\", or Prasaṅgika point of view, the Rimé movement supports \"shen tong\" (\"gzhan tong\"), \"other-empty\", an essential nature which is \"pure radiant non-dual consciousness\". Jamgon Kongtrul says about the two systems:\n\nModern scholarship points to the various possible interpretations of Buddha Nature as either an essential self, as Sunyata, or as the \"inherent possibility\" of awakening.\n\nShenpen Hookham, Oxford Buddhist scholar and Tibetan lama of the Shentong tradition writes of the Buddha-nature or \"true self\" as something real and permanent, and already present within the being as uncompounded enlightenment. She calls it \"the Buddha within\", and comments:\nBuddhist scholar and chronicler, Merv Fowler, writes that the Buddha-nature really is present as an essence within each being. Fowler comments:\nAccording to Heng-Ching Shih, the \"tathāgatagarbha\"/Buddha-nature does not represent a substantial self (\"ātman\"). Rather, it is a positive language expression of emptiness (\"śūnyatā\"), which emphasizes the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. The intention of the teaching of \"tathāgatagarbha\"/Buddha nature is soteriological rather than theoretical.\n\nPaul Williams puts forward the Madhyamaka interpretation of the Buddha-nature as emptiness in the following terms:\nSeveral contemporary Japanese Buddhist scholars, headed under the label Critical Buddhism (\"hihan bukky\"ō, 批仏教), have been critical of Buddha-nature thought. According to Matsumoto Shiro and Hakamaya Noriaki of Komazawa University, essentialist conceptions of Buddha-nature are at odds with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of dependent origination and non-self (\"anātman\"\")\". The Buddha nature doctrines which they label as \"dhātuvāda\" (“substantialism,”sometimes rendered “locus theory” or “topicalism”) and “generative monism” is not Buddhism at all. As defined by Matsumoto, this \"locus\" theory or \"dhātuvāda\" which he rejects as un-buddhist is:It is the theory that the single (\"eka, sama\") existent “locus” (\"dhatu\") or basis is the cause that produces the manifold phenomena or “super-loci” (\"dharmah\").Matsumoto further argues that:Tathagatagarbha thought was a Buddhist version of Hindu monism, formed by the influence of Hinduism gradually introduced into Buddhism, especially after the rise of Mahayana Buddhism.Other Japanese scholars responded to this view leading to a lively debate in Japan. Takasaki Jikido, a well known authority on \"tathagathagarbha\" thought, accepted that Buddha nature theories are similar to Upanishadic theories and that \"dhātuvāda\" is an accurate expression of the structure of these doctrines\",\" but argues that the Buddha nature texts are aware of this and that Buddha nature is not necessarily un-Buddhist or anti-Buddhist. Likewise, Hirakawa Akira, sees Buddha nature as the potential to attain Buddhahood which not static but ever changing and argues that \"dhātu\" does not necessarily mean substratum (he points to some Agamas which identify \"dhatu\" with \"pratitya-samutpada\").\n\nWestern scholars have reacted in different ways to this idea. Sallie B. King objects to their view, seeing the Buddha-nature as a metaphor for the potential in all beings to attain Buddhahood, rather than as an ontological reality. Robert H. Sharf notes that the worries of the Critical Buddhists is nothing new, for \"the early \"tathāgatagarbha\" scriptures betray a similar anxiety, as they tacitly acknowledge that the doctrine is close to, if not identical with, the heretical ātmavāda teachings of the non- Buddhists.\" He also notes how the \"Nirvāṇa-sūtra\" \"tacitly concedes the non-Buddhist roots of the \"tathāgatagarbha\" idea.\" Sharf also has pointed out how certain Southern Chan masters were concerned with other interpretations of Buddha nature, showing how the tendency to critique certain views of Buddha nature is not new in East Asian Buddhism.\n\nPeter N. Gregory has also argued that at least some East Asian interpretations of Buddha nature are equivalent to what Critical Buddhists call \"dhātuvāda,\" especially the work of Tsung-mi, who \"emphasizes the underlying ontological ground on which all phenomenal appearances (\"hsiang\") are based, which he variously refers to as the nature (\"hsing\"), the one mind (\"i-hsin\")...\". According to Dan Lusthaus, certain Chinese Buddhist ideologies which became dominant in the 8th century promoted the idea of an \"underlying metaphysical substratum\" or \"underlying, invariant, universal metaphysical 'source'\" and thus do seem to be a kind of \"dhātuvāda.\" According to Lusthaus \"in early T’ang China (7th–8th century) there was a deliberate attempt to divorce Chinese Buddhism from developments in India.\" Lusthaus notes that the Huayen thinker Fa-tsang was influential in this theological trend who promoted the idea that true Buddhism was about comprehending the \"One Mind that alone is the ground of reality\" (\"wei- hsin).\"\n\nPaul Williams too has criticised this view, saying that Critical Buddhism is too narrow in its definition of what constitutes Buddhism. According to Williams, \"We should abandon any simplistic identification of Buddhism with a straightforward not-Self definition\".\n\nSutton agrees with Williams' critique on the narrowness of any single interpretation. In discussing the inadequacy of modern scholarship on Buddha-nature, Sutton states, \n\nHe goes on to point out that the term \"tathāgatagarbha\" has up to six possible connotations. Of these, he says the three most important are:\nOf these three, Sutton claims that only the third connotation has any soteriological significance, while the other two posit Buddha-nature as an ontological reality and essential nature behind all phenomena.\n\n\n"}

The Dominion Ruler is the Head of the Dominion or Kingdom.\n\nThe Dominion was founded, it states, by direct message to its founder by God to disseminate the \"whole truth of God throughout the world\". Thus divine messages of guidance and revelation through the Dominion founder are the underscoring foundation of Universal Triumph Dominion of God. Its sacred text is the Christian Bible.\n\nDominion publications that interpret and explain the Bible in light of the divine revelations of the Dominion founder, Prophet Jones, are 'The Mind Awakener' and 'The Message'. The procedure to properly conduct weekly Dominion services are in 'The ritual'. Further instructions for citizens and auxiliaries and other components that make up the Dominion of God are in 'The Dominion Constitution'. The Dominion consists of numerous 'churches' called \"Thankful Centers\" around the United States and abroad.\n\nThe Dominion is led by the Dominion Ruler. The founding Dominion Ruler, James F. Jones, is known to the citizens of the Dominion of God as 'God's only Holy Prophet'. The Dominion Ruler is assisted in his duties by The First Dominion Lady and the Dominion Chief Secretary known as the Universal Dominion Executor. The Universal Dominion Executor presides over the Diocean Administers. The Diocean Administers preside over the various districts, or Diocese, that compose the Dominion. Several Thankful Centers make up a Dominion district. The local Thankful Center is led by a Dominion minister called the Local Administrator. The Local Administrator oversees weekly Dominion services as well as the local activities of the Dominion auxiliary clubs.\n\nAn annual international Dominion conference called the 'General Assembly' is convened by the Dominion hierarchy, the board of directors and the board of trustees of the Dominion, to oversee the world activities of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God. The activities and duties of the General Assembly when convened are to review the efforts of the Dominion workers to establish Thankful Centers, Dominion schools and seminaries throughout the world, to ordain and appoint missionaries and evangelists to head up the work and to appoint and ordain all dignitaries and officials of the Dominion under the direct direction and leadership of the Universal Dominion Ruler.\n\nThe Dominion clergy, workers and auxiliary leaders make up the dignitaries and officials of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God. Both men and women citizens in the Dominion are eligible to serve as auxiliary club and/or laity leaders as well as members of the clergy. Leaders in the work of the Dominion earn and are given royal titles such as sir, prince, princess, lord, and lady by designation from the Dominion Ruler.\n\nThe auxiliary clubs of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God are the Universal Missionary Society, the Universal Praise Bands, the Universal Rescue Workers and the Universal Young Peoples Union. The Universal Missionary Society's duties include establishing thankful centers, Universal Triumph, Dominion of God schools and seminaries throughout the world. The Universal Rescue Workers Union's duties are \"to provide for the widows and orphans, the poor and the needy\". The Universal Young Peoples Union is the youth auxiliary of the Dominion.\n\nThe Dominion was organized and founded in Detroit, Michigan between 1938 and its formation in 1944 by a former Pastor & missionary for Triumph the Church and Kingdom of God in Christ, James F. Jones. Jones, known as \"Prophet Jones\", claimed to be a faith healing minister, and ran a fundamentalist Christian, radio and television ministry. Jones further claimed that he was the second coming of Christ with the divine power to heal, forecast, bless and curse.\n\nJones, as Dominion founder, was the Dominion Ruler from 1944 till his death in 1971. His successor as Dominion Ruler was James Schaffer.\n\nThe Universal Triumph Dominion of God's teachings revolve around heralding the incoming millennial rule of 'perfect bliss' under the 'universal triumph' of the 'kingdom of God', in which the wicked, and death itself, will be destroyed but the Dominion faithful will live forever in incorruptible physical bodies right here on Earth. Those in the Dominion that are faithful now, it teaches, can and do have heaven right here on earth by recognizing the 'divine' calling of the Dominion ruler and by strictly obeying his 'divine' wisdom and rules. When this stage of understanding is adhered too the Dominion declares \"All Is well\": which is the Dominion's signature phrase.\n\nThe Dominion of God holds its founder and first Dominion Ruler, Jones, in the highest esteem. It annually celebrates the week of his birth, beginning November 24, his birthday, called Philamethyu and ending December 1, called Hushdomcalama. For the Dominion this is the sacred time of the year and the celebrations take the place of Christmas as practiced in much of Christianity.\n\nThe Dominion Ruler in the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God is the head religious leader, pastor, and overseer of the church and movement. The Dominion Ruler (the Head of the Dominion, or colloquially, the Kingdom) is understood by the Dominion citizens to be the Universal Divine Ruler similar to a divine king who is in direct contact with God.\n\nThe Dominion Ruler serves as top leader, chief teacher, top trustee and final judge as the 'divine ruler' in the Church of Universal Triumph, Dominion of God. He oversees the international Dominion conference called the General Assembly convened by the Dominion hierarchy, the board of directors and the board of trustees. He also awards high-level and active leaders in the Dominion with royal titles such as sir, prince, princess, lord and lady.\n\n\n"}

During his life, he was apparently the only living teacher representing Caodong/Sōtō school, and he was the last monk of that tradition to be mentioned in the influential \"Transmission of the Lamp\", compiled in 1004. However, as that work was compiled during his lifetime, it lacked biographical information. A biography did not appear until the \"Xudeng lu\" of 1101. He left his birth city to become a monk at Chongxiao Temple in Jinling. His teacher there was named Zhitong, but Dayang soon left when he was 19. He studied with Yuanjiao Liaoyi for a time, but eventually moved on, finally settling on Liangshan Yuanguan as his teacher.\n\nDayang Jingxuan is an important figure in the Caodong/Sōtō Zen lineage because he was apparently the only remaining representative of the Caodong/Sōtō tradition during his lifetime. Furthermore, he is significant because the lineage effectively died out with him, but through highly unusual means, the lineage was passed on to someone he had never met. Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the \"Chanlin sengbao zhuan\" (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan), suggests that Touzi Yiqing was the \"true son\", or student, of Dayang. The \"Xudeng lu\" of 1101 lists Touzi and nine others as disciples of Dayang. However, it explains that Touzi did not actually receive dharma transmission from Dayang, but from Fushan Fayuan. Fushan had been a student of Dayang, but he himself had not received dharma transmission from Dayang either. The scholar Morten Schlütter notes that this form of lineage transfer \"has no real parallel in early Chan literature\". This refers to the fact that Touzi was able to be considered the immediate heir to Dayang's lineage without having met him, and that Fayuan was able to hold Dayang's lineage \"in trust\" without actually being a bona fide heir. Schlütter further interprets Huihong's likely embellished account as an attempt to strengthen the rather weak link between Touzi and the last Caodong monk recorded in the \"Transmission of the Lamp\" in order to solidify the legitimacy of the lineage.\n"}
{"id": "2379716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2379716", "title": "Devolution (biology)", "text": "Devolution (biology)\n\nDevolution, de-evolution, or backward evolution is the notion that species can revert to supposedly more primitive forms over time. The concept is related to the idea that evolution has a purpose (teleology) and is progressive (orthogenesis), for example that feet might be better than hooves or lungs than gills. However, evolutionary biology makes no such assumptions, and natural selection shapes adaptations with no foreknowledge of any kind. It is possible for small changes such as in the frequency of a single gene to be reversed by chance or selection, but this is no different from the normal course of evolution.\n\nIn the 19th century, when belief in orthogenesis was widespread, the idea of devolution was advocated by zoologists such as Ray Lankester and Anton Dohrn, and the palaeontologists Alpheus Hyatt and Carl H. Eigenmann. The idea was used in Kurt Vonnegut's 1985 novel \"Galápagos\", where he portrays a society that has evolved backwards to have small brains.\n\nDollo's law of irreversibility, first stated in 1893 by the palaeontologist Louis Dollo, denies the possibility of devolution. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins explains Dollo's law as being simply a statement about the improbability of evolution's following precisely the same path twice.\n\nThe idea of devolution is based on the presumption of orthogenesis, the view that evolution has a purposeful direction towards increasing complexity. Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption. and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in vestigiality or in loss of genes. Earlier views that species are subject to \"cultural decay\", \"drives to perfection\", or \"devolution\" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory. Early scientific theories of transmutation of species such as Lamarckism perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that adaptation through natural selection comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less \"successful\"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of genetics and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by Gregor Mendel. Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the modern evolutionary synthesis or the neo-Darwinism of the 20th century. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular alleles. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new mutations. Selection also might arise from more complex epigenetic or other chromosomal changes, but the fundamental requirement is that any adaptive effect must be heritable.\n\nThe concept of devolution on the other hand, requires that there be a preferred hierarchy of structure and function, and that evolution must mean \"progress\" to \"more advanced\" organisms. For example, it could be said that \"feet are better than hooves\" or \"lungs are better than gills\", so their development is \"evolutionary\" whereas change to an inferior or \"less advanced\" structure would be called \"devolution\". In reality an evolutionary biologist defines all heritable changes to relative frequencies of the genes or indeed to epigenetic states in the gene pool as evolution. All gene pool changes that lead to increased fitness in terms of appropriate aspects of reproduction are seen as (neo-)Darwinian adaptation because, for the organisms possessing the changed structures, each is a useful adaptation to their circumstances. For example, hooves have advantages for running quickly on plains, which benefits horses, and feet offer advantages in climbing trees, which some ancestors of humans did.\n\nThe concept of devolution as regress from progress relates to the ancient ideas that either life came into being through special creation or that humans are the ultimate product or goal of evolution. The latter belief is related to anthropocentrism, the idea that human existence is the point of all universal existence. Such thinking can lead on to the idea that species evolve because they \"need to\" in order to adapt to environmental changes. Biologists refer to this misconception as teleology, the idea of intrinsic finality that things are \"supposed\" to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way to pursue their own good. From a biological viewpoint, in contrast, if species evolve it is not a reaction to necessity, but rather that the population contains variations with traits that favour their natural selection. This view is supported by the fossil record which demonstrates that roughly ninety-nine percent of all species that ever lived are now extinct.\n\nPeople thinking in terms of devolution commonly assume that progress is shown by increasing complexity, but biologists studying the evolution of complexity find evidence of many examples of decreasing complexity in the record of evolution. The lower jaw in fish, reptiles and mammals has seen a decrease in complexity, if measured by the number of bones. Ancestors of modern horses had several toes on each foot; modern horses have a single hooved toe. Modern humans may be evolving towards never having wisdom teeth, and already have lost most of the tail found in many other mammals - not to mention other vestigial structures, such as the vermiform appendix or the nictitating membrane. In some cases, the of living creatures can also “shift” downwards (e.g., the loss of multicellularity in some groups of protists and fungi).\n\nA more rational version of the concept of devolution, a version that does not involve concepts of \"primitive\" or \"advanced\" organisms, is based on the observation that if certain genetic changes in a particular combination (sometimes in a particular sequence as well) are precisely reversed, one should get precise reversal of the evolutionary process, yielding an atavism or \"throwback\", whether more or less complex than the ancestors where the process began. At a trivial level, where just one or a few mutations are involved, selection pressure in one direction can have one effect, which can be reversed by new patterns of selection when conditions change. That could be seen as reversed evolution, though the concept is not of much interest because it does not differ in any functional or effective way from any other adaptation to selection pressures. As the number of genetic changes rises however, one combinatorial effect is that it becomes vanishingly unlikely that the full course of adaptation can be reversed precisely. Also, if one of the original adaptations involved complete loss of a gene, one can neglect any probability of reversal. Accordingly, one might well expect reversal of peppered moth colour changes, but not reversal of the loss of limbs in snakes.\n\nThe concept of degenerative evolution was used by scientists in the 19th century, at this time it was believed by most biologists that evolution had some kind of direction.\n\nIn 1857 the physician Bénédict Morel influenced by Lamarckism claimed that environmental factors such as taking drugs or alcohol would produce social degeneration in the offspring of those individuals, and would revert those offspring to a primitive state. Morel, a devout Catholic, had believed that mankind had started in perfection, contrasting modern humanity to the past, Morel claimed there had been \"Morbid deviation from an original type\". His theory of devolution was later advocated by some biologists.\n\nAccording to Roger Luckhurst:\n\nDarwin soothed readers that evolution was progressive, and directed towards human perfectibility. The next generation of biologists were less confident or consoling. Using Darwin's theory, and many rival biological accounts of development then in circulation, scientists suspected that it was just as possible to \"devolve\", to slip back down the evolutionary scale to prior states of development.\n\nOne of the first biologists to suggest devolution was Ray Lankester, he explored the possibility that evolution by natural selection may in some cases lead to devolution, an example he studied was the regressions in the life cycle of sea squirts. Lankester discussed the idea of devolution in his book \"Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism\" (1880). He was a critic of progressive evolution, pointing out that higher forms existed in the past which have since degenerated into simpler forms. Lankester argued that \"if it was possible to evolve, it was also possible to devolve, and that complex organisms could devolve into simpler forms or animals\".\n\nAnton Dohrn also developed a theory of degenerative evolution based on his studies of vertebrates. According to Dohrn many chordates are degenerated because of their environmental conditions. Dohrn claimed cyclostomes such as lampreys are degenerate fish as there is no evidence their jawless state is an ancestral feature but is the product of environmental adaptation due to parasitism. According to Dohrn if cyclotomes would devolve further then they would resemble something like an Amphioxus.\n\nThe historian of biology Peter J. Bowler has written that devolution was taken seriously by proponents of orthogenesis and others in the late 19th century who at this period of time firmly believed that there was a direction in evolution. Orthogenesis was the belief that evolution travels in internally directed trends and levels. The paleontologist Alpheus Hyatt discussed devolution in his work, using the concept of \"racial senility\" as the mechanism of devolution. Bowler defines \"racial senility\" as \"an evolutionary retreat back to a state resembling that from which it began.\"\n\nHyatt who studied the fossils of invertebrates believed that up to a point ammonoids developed by regular stages up until a specific level but would later due to unfavourable conditions descend back to a previous level, this according to Hyatt was a form of lamarckism as the degeneration was a direct response to external factors. To Hyatt after the level of degeneration the species would then become extinct, according to Hyatt there was a \"phase of youth, a phase of maturity, a phase of senility or degeneration foreshadowing the extinction of a type\". To Hyatt the devolution was predetermined by internal factors which organisms can neither control or reverse. This idea of all evolutionary branches eventually running out of energy and degenerating into extinction was a pessimistic view of evolution and was unpopular amongst many scientists of the time.\n\nCarl H. Eigenmann an ichthyologist wrote \"Cave vertebrates of America: a study in degenerative evolution\" (1909) in which he concluded that cave evolution was essentially degenerative. The entomologist William Morton Wheeler and the Lamarckian Ernest MacBride (1866–1940) also advocated degenerative evolution. According to Macbride invertebrates were actually degenerate vertebrates, his argument was based on the idea that \"crawling on the seabed was inherently less stimulating than swimming in open waters.\"\n\nComplex organs evolve in a lineage over many generations, and once lost they are unlikely to re-evolve. This observation is sometimes generalized to a hypothesis known as \"Dollo's law\", which states that evolution is not reversible. This does not mean that similar engineering solutions cannot be found by natural selection. For instance the tail of the cetacea—whales, dolphins and porpoises which are evolved from formerly land-dwelling mammals—is an adaptation of the spinal column for propulsion in water. Unlike the tails of the mammal's marine ancestor, the Sarcopterygii, and of the teleosts, which move from side to side, the cetacean's tail moves up and down as it flexes its mammalian spine, but the function of the tail in providing propulsion is remarkably similar.\n\nKurt Vonnegut's 1985 novel \"Galápagos\" is set a million years in the future, where humans have \"devolved\" to have much smaller brains.\n\n"}

{"id": "415601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415601", "title": "Divine providence", "text": "Divine providence\n\nIn theology, divine providence, or just providence, is God's intervention in the Universe. The term \"Divine Providence\" (usually capitalized) is also used as a title of God. A distinction is usually made between \"general providence\", which refers to God's continuous upholding of the existence and natural order of the Universe, and \"special providence\", which refers to God's extraordinary intervention in the life of people. Miracles generally fall in the latter category.\n\nThe word comes from Latin \"providentia\" \"foresight, prudence\", from \"pro-\" \"ahead\" and \"videre\" \"to see\". The current use of the word has the sense of \"knowledge of the future\" or omniscience, understood as an attribute of God.\n\nAugustine of Hippo is perhaps most famously associated with the doctrine of divine providence in the Latin West. Augustine held that since God's governance takes place in the universe comprising a vast multitude of relatively independent individuals differing in nature, function, and end, this implies the continuous control and unifying governance of a single supreme Being. \n\nHowever, Christian teaching on providence in the High Middle Ages was most fully developed by Thomas Aquinas in the \"Summa Theologica\". The concept of providence as care exercised by God over the universe, his foresight and care for its future is extensively developed and explained both by Aquinas himself and modern Thomists. One of the foremost modern Thomists, Dominican father Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, wrote a study of providence entitled \"Providence: God's loving care for man and the need for confidence in Almighty God.\" In it, he presents and solves, according to Catholic doctrine, the most difficult issues as related to providence.\n\nThis term is an integral part of John Calvin's theological framework known as Calvinism, which emphasizes the total depravity of man and the complete sovereignty of God. God's plan for the world and every soul that he has created is guided by his will, or providence. According to Calvin, the idea that man has free will and is able to make choices independently of what God has already determined is based on our limited understanding of God's perfection and the idea that God's purposes can be circumvented. In this mode of thought, providence is related to absolute free will. This concept remains prominent among many Protestant denominations that identify with Calvinism, the Reformed churches.\n\nIn Lutheran theology, divine providence refers to God's preservation of creation, his cooperation with everything that happens, and his guiding of the universe. While God cooperates with both good and evil deeds, with the evil deeds he does so only inasmuch as they are deeds, not with the evil in them. God concurs with an act's effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect. Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.\n\nAccording to Martin Luther, divine providence began when God created the world with everything needed for human life, including both physical things and natural laws. In Luther's Small Catechism, the explanation of the first article of the Apostles' Creed declares that everything people have that is good is given and preserved by God, either directly or through other people or things. Of the services others provide us through family, government, and work, he writes, \"we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God.\" Since God uses everyone's useful tasks for good, people should look not down upon some useful vocations as being less worthy than others. Instead people should honor others, no matter how lowly, as being the means God uses to work in the world.\n\nThe doctrine of providence in Eastern Orthodoxy is set out by St John of Tobolsk:\n\"St. John Damascene describes it thus: 'Providence is Divine will which maintains everything and wisely rules over everything' ... It was not by chance that the iniquitous Israeli King Ahab was struck by an arrow that flew in between the seams of his armor. Truly that arrow was directed by the hand of God, just as was the one which struck Julian the Apostate; only for the soldier who let fly the arrow was it accidental. It was not by chance that swallows flew into the home of Tobit and blinded the righteous man. This happened at God’s command, in order to hold Tobit up as an example to succeeding generations, as we learn from the Angel who accompanied his son Tobias. Nothing happens by chance. It was not by chance that Caesar Augustus ordered the census to be taken in the year of Christ’s Nativity. It was not by chance that Christ met with the Samaritan woman at the well in Sychar and spoke with her. All this was foreseen and written down in the books of Divine Providence before the beginning of time.”\n\n\"Divine Providence\" is a book published by Emanuel Swedenborg in 1764 which describes his systematic theology regarding providence, free will, theodicy, and other related topics. Both meanings of providence are applicable in Swedenborg's theology, in that providence encompasses understanding, intent and action. Divine providence relative to man is 'foresight', and relative to the Lord is 'providence'. Swedenborg proposes that one law of divine providence is that man should act from freedom according to reason, and that man is regenerated according to the faculties of rationality and liberty.\n\nDivine providence ( \"Hashgochoh Protis\" / \"Hashgachah Pratit\" lit. [Divine] supervision of the individual) is discussed throughout Rabbinic literature, and in particular by the classical Jewish philosophers. These writings maintain that divine providence means that God is directing (or even recreating) every minute detail of creation. This analysis thus underpins much of Orthodox Judaism's world view, particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world.\n\nThere is little theological literature on the terms provenance or providence in LDS studies. As stated above, Reformed theology relates these terms to predestination, which does have more prominence in LDS theology, if only as a polemical term. \n\nOne particular text that could be interpreted as being related to such terms is in the Book of Abraham. As Abraham is shown the heavens, he is also shown the pre-mortal spirits of mankind. And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.The \"making of rulers\" above is explained as foreordination (in the chapter summary) as opposed to \"predestination\". This differentiation balances free will (or free agency in LDS theology) against Divine intervenion. Noted LDS scholar Richard Draper has described the church's position thusly, \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rejects the belief in predestination-that God predetermines the salvation or the damnation of every individual ... The LDS position is based in part on the teachings of Paul that God \"will render to every man according to his deeds\" and that \"there is no respect of persons with God\" (Rom. 2:6, 11). These two principles provide a basis for understanding Paul's use of the term \"predestination.\" The term apparently connoted \"to be ordained beforehand for godly labor.\" In the sense that one's potential or calling has been recognized and declared, this interpretation conforms with the Greek term Paul used, \"proorizo\", and does not denote an irreversible or irresistible predetermination.\"\n\nHowever, this does not imply a passive God. In fact, LDS theology favours a more active, interventionist God. In its more recent General Conferences of the church, Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, clearly articulates this, \"Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another\" Rasband continues by citing a well-known text from in the Book of Mormon, in which Nephi finds his nemesis unconscious from inebriation in front of him, he concludes, \"Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban? Or was it by “divine design”? Although the text itself limits the interaction of the Divine to the \"Spirit\" to commanding Nephi to \"Slay him.\"\n\nIt is important to note, though, that God also limits his involvement. Rasband interprets one particular passage from the Book of Mormon as saying that God (through his Spirit) will only intervene based on righteousness. Rasband concludes that, \"When we are righteous, willing, and able, when we are striving to be worthy and qualified, we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father’s “divine design.”\n\nThose who believe in the inerrancy of the original biblical manuscripts often accompany this belief with a statement about how the biblical text has been preserved so that what we have today is at least substantially similar to what was written. That is, just as God \"divinely inspired the text,\" so he has also \"divinely preserved it throughout the centuries.\" The Westminster Confession of Faith states that the Scriptures, \"being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical.\"\n\nThis is an important argument in the King James Only debates. Edward F. Hills argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed Textus Receptus must be the closest text to the Greek autographs.\n\n\n\n"}

He was chairman of the Democratic Front of Albania and commander-in-chief of the armed forces from 1944 until his death. He served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Albania from 1944 to 1954 and at various times served as foreign minister and defence minister as well.\n\nBorn in Gjirokastër in 1908, Hoxha became a teacher in grammar school in 1936. Following Italy's invasion of Albania, he entered into the Party of Labour of Albania at its creation in 1941. Hoxha was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34. The Yugoslav Partisans assisted the Albanians. Less than two years after the liberation of the country, the monarchy was abolished, King Zog was deposed and Hoxha rose to power as the head of state of Albania.\n\nDuring his 40-year-rule, he focused on rebuilding the country, which was left in ruins after World War II, building Albania's first railway line, raising the adult literacy rate from 5% to 98%, and leading Albania towards becoming agriculturally self-sufficient. However, detractors criticize him for a series of political repressions which included the establishment and use of forced labor camps, extrajudicial killings and executions that targeted and eliminated anti-communists, a large number of which was carried out by the Sigurimi secret police.\n\nHoxha's government was characterized by his proclaimed firm adherence to anti-revisionist Marxism–Leninism from the mid-1970s onwards. After his break with Maoism in the 1976–1978 period, numerous Maoist parties around the world declared themselves Hoxhaist. The International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity & Struggle) is the best-known association of these parties today.\n\nHoxha was born in Gjirokastër, a city in southern Albania (then a part of the Ottoman Empire), the son of Halil Hoxha, a Muslim Tosk cloth merchant who travelled widely across Europe and the United States, and Gjylihan (Gjylo) Hoxha née \"Çuçi\".\n\nThe Hoxha family was attached to the Bektashi Order; in 1916 his father brought him to seek the blessing of Baba Selim of the Zall Teqe.\n\nAfter the maktab, he followed his studies in the city senior high school \"Liria\". He started his studies at the Gjirokastër Lyceum in 1923. After the lyceum was closed, thanks to the intervention of Eqrem Libohova Hoxha was awarded a state scholarship for the continuation of his studies in Korçë, at the French language Albanian National Lyceum until 1930.\nIn 1930, Hoxha went to study at the University of Montpellier in France on a state scholarship for the faculty of natural science. He never took an exam staying four years in Montpellier, against the Albanian laws of the time. He never returned the scholarship. He later went to Paris, where he presented himself to anti-Zogist immigrants as the brother-in-law of Bahri Omari.\n\nIn the years 1935 to 1936, he was employed as a secretary at the Albanian consulate in Brussels. After returning to Albania, he worked as a contract teacher in the Gymnasium of Tirana. Hoxha taught morals in the Korça Liceum from 1937 to 1939 and also served as the caretaker of the school library.\n\nOn 7 April 1939, Albania was invaded by Fascist Italy. The Italians established a puppet government, the Albanian Kingdom (1939–43), under Shefqet Vërlaci. Hoxha was indifferent regarding the invasion. \nIn the summer of 1939 he went to Italy on vacation. At the end of 1939, he was transferred to the Gjirokastra Gymnasium, but he soon returned to Tirana. He was helped by his best friend, Esat Dishnica, who introduced Hoxha to Dishnica's cousin Ibrahim Biçakçiu. Hoxha started to sleep in Biçakçiu's tobacco factory \"Flora\", and after a while Dishnica opened a shop with the same name, where Hoxha started to work. He was a sympathizer of Korça's Communist Group.\n\nOn 8 November 1941, the Communist Party of Albania (later renamed the Party of Labour of Albania in 1948) was founded. Hoxha was chosen from the \"Korca group\" as a Muslim representative by the two Yugoslav envoys as one of the seven members of the provisional Central Committee. The First Consultative Meeting of Activists of the Communist Party of Albania was held in Tirana from April 8 to 11, 1942, with Hoxha himself delivering the main report on 8 April 1942.\n\nIn July 1942, Hoxha wrote \"Call to the Albanian Peasantry\", issued in the name of the Communist Party of Albania. The call sought to enlist support in Albania for the war against the fascists. The peasants were encouraged to hoard their grain and refuse to pay taxes or livestock levies brought by the government. After the September 1942 Conference at Pezë, the National Liberation Movement was founded with the purpose of uniting the anti-fascist Albanians, regardless of ideology or class.\n\nBy March 1943, the first National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha formally as First Secretary. During World War II, the Soviet Union's role in Albania was negligible. On 10 July 1943, the Albanian partisans were organised in regular units of companies, battalions and brigades and named the Albanian National Liberation Army. The organization received military support from the British intelligence service, SOE. The General Headquarters was created, with Spiro Moisiu as the commander and Hoxha as political commissar. The Yugoslav Partisans had a much more practical role, helping to plan attacks and exchanging supplies, but communication between them and the Albanians was limited and letters would often arrive late, sometimes well after a plan had been agreed upon by the National Liberation Army without consultation from the Yugoslav partisans.\n\nWithin Albania, repeated attempts were made during the war to remedy the communications difficulties which faced partisan groups. In August 1943, a secret meeting, the Mukje Conference, was held between the anti-communist Balli Kombëtar (National Front) and the Communist Party of Albania. The result of this was an agreement to:\n\n\nTo encourage the Balli Kombëtar to sign, the Greater Albania sections that included Kosovo (part of Yugoslavia) and Chamëria were made part of the Agreement.\n\nA problem developed when the Yugoslav Communists disagreed with the goal of a Greater Albania and asked the Communists in Albania to withdraw their agreement. According to Hoxha, Josip Broz Tito had not agreed that \"Kosovo was Albanian\" and that Serbian opposition made the transfer an unwise option. After the Albanian Communists repudiated the Greater Albania agreement, the Balli Kombëtar condemned the Communists, who in turn accused the Balli Kombëtar of siding with the Italians. The Balli Kombëtar, however, lacked support from the people. After judging the Communists as an immediate threat, the Balli Kombëtar sided with Nazi Germany, fatally damaging its image among those fighting the Fascists. The Communists quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the Balli Kombëtar and took centre stage in the fight for liberation.\nThe Permet National Congress held during that time called for a \"new democratic Albania for the people\". Although the monarchy was not formally abolished, King Zog was barred from returning to the country, which further increased the Communists' control. The Anti-Fascist Committee for National Liberation was founded, chaired by Hoxha. On 22 October 1944, the Committee became the Democratic Government of Albania after a meeting in Berat and Hoxha was chosen as interim Prime Minister. Tribunals were set up to try alleged war criminals who were designated \"enemies of the people\" and were presided over by Koçi Xoxe.\n\nAfter liberation on 29 November 1944, several Albanian partisan divisions crossed the border into German-occupied Yugoslavia, where they fought alongside Tito's partisans and the Soviet Red Army in a joint campaign which succeeded in driving out the last pockets of German resistance. Marshal Tito, during a Yugoslavian conference in later years, thanked Hoxha for the assistance that the Albanian partisans had given during the War for National Liberation (\"Lufta Nacionalçlirimtare\"). The Democratic Front, dominated by the Albanian Communist Party, succeeded the National Liberation Front in August 1945 and the first post-war election was the held on 2 December. The Front was the only legal political organisation allowed to stand in the elections, and the government reported that 93% of Albanians voted for it.\n\nOn 11 January 1946, Zog was officially deposed and Albania was proclaimed the People's Republic of Albania (renamed the People's Socialist Republic of Albania in 1976). As First Secretary, Hoxha was \"de facto\" head of state and the most powerful man in the country.\n\nAlbanians celebrate their independence day on 28 November (which is the date on which they declared their independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912), while in the former People's Socialist Republic of Albania the national day was 29 November, the day the country was liberated from the Italians. Both days are currently national holidays.\n\nHoxha declared himself a Marxist–Leninist and strongly admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. During the period of 1945–1950, the government adopted policies which were intended to consolidate power. The Agrarian Reform Law was passed in August 1945. It confiscated land from beys and large landowners, giving it without compensation to peasants. 52% of all land was owned by large landowners before the law was passed; this declined to 16% after the law's passage. Illiteracy, which was 90–95% in rural areas in 1939 went down to 30% by 1950 and by 1985 it was equal to that of a Western country.\n\nThe State University of Tirana was established in 1957, which was the first of its kind in Albania. The Medieval Gjakmarrja (blood feud) was banned. Malaria, the most widespread disease, was successfully fought through advances in health care, the use of DDT, and through the draining of swamplands. From 1965 to 1985, no cases of malaria were reported, whereas previously Albania had the greatest number of infected patients in Europe. No cases of syphilis had been recorded for 30 years.\n\nBy 1949, the United States and British intelligence organisations were working with King Zog and the mountain men of his personal guard. They recruited Albanian refugees and émigrés from Egypt, Italy and Greece, trained them in Cyprus, Malta and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), and infiltrated them into Albania. Guerrilla units entered Albania in 1950 and 1952, but they were killed or captured by Albanian security forces. Kim Philby, a Soviet double agent working as a liaison officer between the British intelligence service and the United States Central Intelligence Agency, had leaked details of the infiltration plan to Moscow, and the security breach claimed the lives of about 300 infiltrators.\n\nAt this point, relations with Yugoslavia had begun to change. The roots of the change began on 20 October 1944 at the Second Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Albania. The Session considered the problems that the post-independence Albanian government would face. However, the Yugoslav delegation led by Velimir Stoinić accused the party of \"sectarianism and opportunism\" and blamed Hoxha for these errors. He also stressed the view that the Yugoslav Communist partisans spearheaded the Albanian partisan movement.\n\nAnti-Yugoslav members of the Albanian Communist Party had begun to think that this was a plot by Tito who intended to destabilize the Party. Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.\n\nThe first issue was that the Albanian lek became revalued in terms of the Yugoslav dinar as a customs union was formed and Albania's economic plan was decided more by Yugoslavia. Albanian economists H. Banja and V. Toçi stated that the relationship between Albania and Yugoslavia during this period was exploitative and that it constituted attempts by Yugoslavia to make the Albanian economy an \"appendage\" to the Yugoslav economy. Hoxha then began to accuse Yugoslavia of misconduct:\n\nJoseph Stalin advised Hoxha that Yugoslavia was attempting to annex Albania: \"We did not know that the Yugoslavs, under the pretext of 'defending' your country against an attack from the Greek fascists, wanted to bring units of their army into the PRA [People's Republic of Albania]. They tried to do this in a very secretive manner. In reality, their aim in this direction was utterly hostile, for they intended to overturn the situation in Albania.\" By June 1947, the Central Committee of Yugoslavia began publicly condemning Hoxha, accusing him of talking an individualistic and anti-Marxist line. When Albania responded by making agreements with the Soviet Union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery, Yugoslavia said that Albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without Yugoslav approval.\n\nKoçi Xoxe tried to stop Hoxha from improving relations with Bulgaria, reasoning that Albania would be more stable with one trading partner rather than with many. Nako Spiru, an anti-Yugoslav member of the Party, condemned Xoxe and vice versa. With no one coming to Spiru's defense, he viewed the situation as hopeless and feared that Yugoslav domination of his nation was imminent, which caused him to commit suicide in November.\n\nAt the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party which lasted from 26 February to 8 March 1948, Xoxe was implicated in a plot to isolate Hoxha and consolidate his own power. He accused Hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with Yugoslavia and stated that a Soviet military mission should be expelled in favor of a Yugoslav counterpart. Hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined. When Yugoslavia publicly broke with the Soviet Union, Hoxha's support base grew stronger. Then, on 1 July 1948, Tirana called on all Yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all treaties and agreements between the two countries null and void. Xoxe was expelled from the party and on 13 June 1949, he was executed by hanging.\n\nAfter the break with Yugoslavia, Hoxha aligned himself with the Soviet Union, for which he had a great admiration. From 1948 to 1960, $200 million in Soviet aid was given to Albania for technical and infrastructural expansion. Albania was admitted to the Comecon on 22 February 1949 and remained important both as a way to pressure Yugoslavia and to serve as a pro-Soviet force in the Adriatic Sea. A submarine base was built on the island of Sazan near Vlorë, posing a possible threat to the United States Sixth Fleet. Relations remained close until the death of Stalin on 5 March 1953. His death was met with 14 days of national mourning in Albania—more than in the Soviet Union. Hoxha assembled the entire population in the capital's largest square featuring a statue of Stalin, requested that they kneel, and made them take a two-thousand word oath of \"eternal fidelity\" and \"gratitude\" to their \"beloved father\" and \"great liberator\" to whom the people owed \"everything\".\n\nUnder Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin's successor, aid was reduced and Albania was encouraged to adopt Khrushchev's specialization policy. Under this policy, Albania would develop its agricultural output in order to supply the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations while these nations would be developing specific resource outputs of their own, which would, in theory, strengthen the Warsaw Pact by greatly reducing the lack of certain resources that many of the nations faced. However, this also meant that Albanian industrial development, which was stressed heavily by Hoxha, would have to be significantly reduced.\nFrom 16 May to 17 June 1955, Nikolai Bulganin and Anastas Mikoyan visited Yugoslavia and Khrushchev renounced the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Communist bloc. Khrushchev also began making references to Palmiro Togliatti's polycentrism theory. Hoxha had not been consulted on this and was offended. Yugoslavia began asking for Hoxha to rehabilitate the image of Koçi Xoxe, which Hoxha steadfastly rejected. In 1956 at the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev condemned the cult of personality that had been built up around Joseph Stalin and also denounced him for many grave mistakes. Khrushchev then announced the theory of peaceful coexistence, which angered Hoxha greatly. The Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies, led by Hoxha's wife Nexhmije, quoted Vladimir Lenin: \"The fundamental principle of the foreign policy of a socialist country and of a Communist party is proletarian internationalism; not peaceful coexistence.\" Hoxha now took a more active stand against perceived revisionism.\n\nUnity within the Albanian Party of Labour began to decline as well, with a special delegate meeting held in Tirana in April 1956, composed of 450 delegates and having unexpected results. The delegates \"criticized the conditions in the party, the negative attitude toward the masses, the absence of party and socialist democracy, the economic policy of the leadership, etc.\" while also calling for discussions on the cult of personality and the Twentieth Party Congress.\n\nIn 1956, Hoxha called for a resolution which would uphold the current leadership of the Party. The resolution was accepted, and all of the delegates who had spoken out were expelled from the party and imprisoned. Hoxha stated that this was yet another of many attempts to overthrow the leadership of Albania which had been organized by Yugoslavia. This incident further consolidated Hoxha's power, effectively making Khrushchev-esque reforms nearly impossible. In the same year, Hoxha traveled to the People's Republic of China, which was then enduring the Sino-Soviet split, and met Mao Zedong. Relations with China improved, as evidenced by Chinese aid to Albania being 4.2% in 1955 before the visit, and rising to 21.6% in 1957.\n\nIn an effort to keep Albania in the Soviet sphere, increased aid was given but the Albanian leadership continued to move closer towards China. Relations with the Soviet Union remained at the same level until 1960, when Khrushchev met Sofoklis Venizelos, a left-wing Greek politician. Khrushchev sympathized with the concept of an autonomous Greek North Epirus and he hoped to use Greek claims to keep the Albanian leadership in line with Soviet interests. Hoxha reacted by only sending Hysni Kapo, a member of the Albanian Political Bureau, to the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party in Bucharest, an event that heads of state were normally expected to attend. As relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate in the course of the meeting, Khrushchev said:\n\nRelations with the Soviet Union began to decline rapidly. A hardline policy was adopted and the Soviets reduced aid shipments, specifically grain, at a time when Albania needed them due to the possibility of a flood-induced famine. In July 1960, a plot to overthrow the Albanian government was discovered. It was to be organized by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral Teme Sejko. After this, two pro-Soviet members of the Party, Liri Belishova and Koço Tashko, were expelled, with a humorous incident involving Tashko pronouncing \"\" (Russian for \"full stop\").\n\nIn August, the Party's Central Committee sent a letter of protest to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stating its displeasure at having an anti-Albanian Soviet Ambassador in Tirana. The Fourth Congress of the Party, held from 13 to 20 February 1961, was the last meeting that the Soviet Union or other Eastern European nations attended in Albania. During the congress, the Soviet Union was condemned while China was praised. Mehmet Shehu stated that while many members of the Party were accused of tyranny, this was a baseless charge and unlike the Soviet Union, Albania was led by genuine Marxists.\n\nThe Soviet Union retaliated by threatening \"dire consequences\" if the condemnations were not retracted. Days later, Khrushchev and Antonín Novotný, President of Czechoslovakia (which was Albania's largest source of aid besides the Soviets), threatened to cut off economic aid. In March, Albania was not invited to attend the meeting of the Warsaw Pact nations (Albania had been one of its founding members in 1955) and in April all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from the nation. In May nearly all Soviet troops on the Orikum naval base were withdrawn, leaving the Albanians with 4 submarines and other military equipment.\n\nOn 7 November 1961, Hoxha made a speech in which he called Khrushchev a \"revisionist, an anti-Marxist and a defeatist\". Hoxha portrayed Stalin as the last Communist leader of the Soviet Union and he began to stress Albania's independence. By 11 November, the USSR and every other Warsaw Pact nation broke relations with Albania. Albania was unofficially excluded (by not being invited) from both the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The Soviet Union also attempted to claim control of the Vlorë port due to a lease agreement; the Albanian Party then passed a law prohibiting any other nation from owning an Albanian port through lease or otherwise. The Soviet–Albanian split was now complete.\n\nAs Hoxha's leadership continued, he took on an increasingly theoretical stance. He wrote criticisms based both on current events at the time and on theory; most notably his condemnations of Maoism post-1978. A major achievement under Hoxha was the advancement of women's rights. Albania had been one of the most, if not the most, patriarchal countries in Europe. The \"Code of Lekë\", which regulated the status of women, states, \"A woman is known as a sack, made to endure as long as she lives in her husband's house.\" Women were not allowed to inherit anything from their parents, and discrimination was even made in the case of the murder of a pregnant woman:\nWomen were forbidden from obtaining a divorce, and the wife's parents were obliged to return a runaway daughter to her husband or else suffer shame which could even result in a generations-long blood feud. During World War II, the Albanian Communists encouraged women to join the partisans and following the war, women were encouraged to take up menial jobs, as the education necessary for higher level work was out of most women's reach. In 1938, 4% worked in various sectors of the economy. In 1970, this number had risen to 38%, and in 1982 to 46%.\n\nDuring the Cultural and Ideological Revolution (discussed below), women were encouraged to take up \"all\" jobs, including government posts, which resulted in 40.7% of the People's Councils and 30.4% of the People's Assembly being made up of women, including two women in the Central Committee by 1985. In 1978, 15.1 times as many females attended eight-year schools as had done so in 1938 and 175.7 times as many females attended secondary schools. By 1978, 101.9 times as many women attended higher schools as in 1957. Hoxha said of women's rights in 1967:The entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on the defense of women's rights.In 1969, direct taxation was abolished and during this period the quality of schooling and health care continued to improve. An electrification campaign was begun in 1960 and the entire nation was expected to have electricity by 1985. Instead, it achieved this on 25 October 1970, making it the first nation with complete electrification in the world. During the Cultural & Ideological Revolution of 1967–1968 the military changed from traditional Communist army tactics and began to adhere to the Maoist strategy known as people's war, which included the abolition of military ranks, which were not fully restored until 1991. Mehmet Shehu said of the country's health service in 1979:'\n\nHoxha's legacy also included a complex of 750,000 one-man concrete bunkers across a country of 3 million inhabitants, to act as look-outs and gun emplacements along with chemical weapons. The bunkers were built strong and mobile, with the intention that they could be easily placed by a crane or a helicopter in a previously dug hole. The types of bunkers vary from machine gun pillboxes, beach bunkers, to underground naval facilities, and even Air Force Mountain and underground bunkers.\n\nHoxha's internal policies were true to Stalin's paradigm which he admired, and the personality cult developed in the 1970s organized around him by the Party also bore a striking resemblance to that of Stalin. At times it even reached an intensity similar to the personality cult surrounding Kim Il-sung (which Hoxha condemned) with Hoxha being portrayed as a genius commenting on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Each schoolbook required one or more quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The Party honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher.\n\nHoxha's governance was also distinguished by his encouragement of a high birthrate policy. For instance, a woman who bore an above-average number of children would be given the government award of \"Heroine Mother\" (in Albanian: \"Nënë Heroinë\") along with cash rewards. Abortion was essentially restricted (to encourage high birth rates), except if the birth posed a danger to the mother's life, though it was not completely banned; the process was decided by district medical commissions. As a result, the population of Albania tripled from 1 million in 1944 to around 3 million in 1985.\n\nIn Albania's Third Five Year Plan, China promised a loan of $125 million to build twenty-five chemical, electrical and metallurgical plants called for under the Plan. However, the nation experienced a difficult transition period, because Chinese technicians were of a lower quality than Soviet ones and the great distance between the two nations, plus the poor relations which Albania had with its neighbors, further complicated matters. Unlike Yugoslavia or the USSR, China had less economic influence on Albania during Hoxha's leadership. The previous fifteen years (1946–1961) had at least 50% of the economy under foreign commerce.\n\nBy the time the 1976 Constitution was promulgated, which prohibited foreign debt, aid and investment, Albania had basically become self-sufficient although it was lacking in modern technology. Ideologically, Hoxha found Mao's initial views to be in line with Marxism-Leninism. Mao condemned Nikita Khrushchev's alleged revisionism and he was also critical of Yugoslavia. Aid given from China was interest-free and it did not have to be repaid until Albania could afford to do so.\n\nChina never intervened in what Albania's economic output should be, and Chinese technicians worked for the same wages as Albanian workers, unlike Soviet technicians who sometimes made more than three times the pay of Hoxha. Albanian newspapers were reprinted in Chinese newspapers and read on Chinese radio. Finally, Albania led the movement to give the People's Republic of China a seat on the UN Security Council, an effort which would prove successful in 1971 when it replaced the Republic of China's seat.\n\nDuring this period, Albania became the second largest producer of chromium in the world, which was considered an important export for Albania. Strategically, the Adriatic Sea was also attractive to China, and the Chinese leadership had hoped to gain more allies in Eastern Europe with Albania's help, although this effort failed. Zhou Enlai visited Albania in January 1964. On 9 January, \"The 1964 Sino-Albanian Joint Statement\" was signed in Tirana. The statement said of relations between socialist countries:\nLike Albania, China defended the \"purity\" of Marxism by attacking both US imperialism and \"Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism\", both equally as part of a \"dual adversary\" theory. Yugoslavia was viewed as both a \"special detachment of U.S. imperialism\" and a \"saboteur against world revolution.\" These views, however, began to change in China, which was one of the major issues which Albania had with the alliance. Also unlike Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Albanian alliance lacked \"... an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination, and it was also characterized by an informal relationship which was conducted on an \"ad hoc\" basis.\" Mao made a speech on 3 November 1966 in which he claimed that Albania was the only Marxist-Leninist state in Europe and in the same speech, he also stated that \"an attack on Albania will have to reckon with great People's China. If the U.S. imperialists, the modern Soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch Albania in the slightest, nothing lies ahead for them but a complete, shameful and memorable defeat.\" Likewise, Hoxha stated that \"You may rest assured, comrades, that come what may in the world at large, our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together. They will fight together and they will win together.\"\n\nChina entered into a four-year period of relative diplomatic isolation following the Cultural Revolution and at this point relations between China and Albania reached their zenith. On 20 August 1968, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was condemned by Albania, as was the Brezhnev doctrine. Albania then officially withdrew from the Warsaw Pact on 5 September. Relations with China began to deteriorate on 15 July 1971, when United States President Richard Nixon agreed to visit China to meet with Zhou Enlai. Hoxha felt betrayed and the government was in a state of shock. On 6 August a letter was sent from the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, calling Nixon a \"frenzied anti-Communist\". The letter stated:\n\nThe result was a 1971 message from the Chinese leadership stating that Albania could not depend on an indefinite flow of further Chinese aid and in 1972, Albania was advised to \"curb its expectations about further Chinese contributions to its economic development\". By 1973, Hoxha wrote in his diary \"Reflections on China\" that the Chinese leaders:\n\nIn response, trade with COMECON (although trade with the Soviet Union was still blocked) and Yugoslavia grew. Trade with Third World nations was $0.5 million in 1973, but $8.3 million in 1974. Trade rose from 0.1% to 1.6%. Following Mao's death on 9 September 1976, Hoxha (who attended Mao's funeral in Beijing) remained optimistic about Sino-Albanian relations, but in August 1977, Hua Guofeng, the new leader of China, stated that Mao's Three Worlds Theory would become official foreign policy. Hoxha viewed this as a way for China to justify having the U.S. as the \"secondary enemy\" while viewing the Soviet Union as the main one, thus allowing China to trade with the U.S. \"the Chinese plan of the 'third world' is a major diabolical plan, with the aim that China should become another superpower, precisely by placing itself at the head of the 'third world' and the 'non-aligned world'.\" From 30 August to 7 September 1977, Tito visited Beijing and was welcomed by the Chinese leadership. At this point, the Albanian Party of Labour had declared that China was now a revisionist state akin to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and that Albania was the only Marxist–Leninist state on Earth. Hoxha stated:\n\nOn 13 July 1978, China announced that it was cutting off all aid to Albania. For the first time in modern history, Albania did not have either an ally or a major trading partner.\n\nCertain clauses in the 1976 constitution effectively circumscribed the exercise of political liberties which the government interpreted as contrary to the established order. In addition, the government denied the population access to information other than that disseminated by the government-controlled media. Internally, the Sigurimi followed the repressive methods of the NKVD, MGB, KGB, and the East German Stasi. At one point, every third Albanian had either been interrogated by the Sigurimi or incarcerated in labour camps.\n\nTo eliminate dissent, the government imprisoned thousands in forced-labour camps or executed them for crimes such as alleged treachery or for disrupting the proletarian dictatorship. Travel abroad was forbidden after 1968 to all but those who were on official business. Western European culture was looked upon with deep suspicion, resulting in arrests and bans on any unauthorised foreign material. Art was required to reflect the styles of socialist realism. Beards were banned as unhygienic in order to curb the influence of Islam (many Imams and Babas had beards) and the Eastern Orthodox faith.\n\nThe justice system regularly degenerated into show trials. An American human rights group described the proceedings of one trial: \"... [The defendant] was not permitted to question the witnesses and that, although he was permitted to state his objections to certain aspects of the case, his objections were dismissed by the prosecutor who said, 'Sit down and be quiet. We know better than you.'\" In order to lessen the threat of political dissidents and other exiles, relatives of the accused were often arrested, ostracised, and accused of being \"enemies of the people\". Political executions were common, and as a result at least 5,000 people—possibly as many as 25,000—were killed by the regime.\n\nTorture was often used to obtain confessions:One émigré, for example, testified to being bound by his hands and legs for one and a half months, and to being beaten with a belt, fists or boots for periods of two to three hours every two or three days. Another was detained in a cell one meter by eight meters large in the local police station and kept in solitary confinement for a five-day period punctuated by two beating sessions until he signed a confession; he was taken to \"Sigurimi\" headquarters, where he was again tortured and questioned, despite his prior confession, until his three-day trial. Still another witness was confined underground for more than a year in a three-meter square cell. During this time he was interrogated at irregular intervals and subjected to various forms of physical and psychological torture. He was chained to a chair, beaten, and subjected to electric shocks. He was shown a bullet that was supposedly meant for him and told that car engines starting within his earshot were driving victims to their executions, the next of which would be his.During Hoxha's rule, \"[t]here were six institutions for political prisoners and fourteen labour camps where political prisoners and common criminals worked together. It has been estimated that there were approximately 32,000 people imprisoned in Albania in 1985.\"\n\nArticle 47 of the Albanian Criminal Code stated that to \"escape outside the state, as well as refusal to return to the Fatherland by a person who has been sent to serve or has been permitted temporarily to go outside the state\" was an act of treason, a crime punishable by a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum sentence of death. The Albanian government went to great lengths in order to prevent people from defecting by leaving the country:An electrically-wired metal fence stands 600 meters to one kilometer from the actual border. Anyone touching the fence not only risks electrocution, but also sets off alarm bells and lights which alert guards stationed at approximately one-kilometer intervals along the fence. Two meters of soil on either side of the fence are cleared in order to check for footprints of escapees and infiltrators. The area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire, noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two wooden slats with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on, and flares that are triggered by contact, thus illuminating would-be escapees during the night.\n\nAlbania, the only predominantly Muslim country in Europe at that time, largely owing to Turkish influence in the region, had not, like the Ottoman Empire, identified religion with ethnicity. In the Ottoman Empire, Muslims were viewed as Turks, Orthodox Christians were viewed as Greeks, and Roman Catholics were viewed as Latins. Hoxha believed this was a serious issue, feeling that it both fueled Greek separatists in southern Albania and that it also divided the nation in general. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1945 confiscated much of the church's property in the country. Catholics were the earliest religious community to be targeted since the Vatican was seen as being an agent of Fascism and anti-Communism. In 1946 the Jesuit Order was banned and the Franciscans were banned in 1947. \"Decree No. 743\" (On religion) sought a national church and forbade religious leaders to associate with foreign powers.\n\nThe Party focused on atheist education in schools. This tactic was effective, primarily due to the high birthrate policy encouraged after the war. During what the religious consider \"holy periods,\" such as Lent and Ramadan, many foods which are scorned by them (dairy products, meat, etc.) were distributed in schools and factories, and those who refused to eat those foods were denounced.\n\nStarting on 6 February 1967, the Party began to promote secularism over Abrahamic religions. Hoxha, who had declared a \"Cultural and Ideological Revolution\" after being partly inspired by China's Cultural Revolution, encouraged communist students and workers to use more forceful tactics to discourage religious practices, although violence was initially condemned.\n\nAccording to Hoxha, the surge in anti-theist activity began with the youth. The result of this \"spontaneous, unprovoked movement\" was the closing of all 2,169 churches and mosques in Albania. State atheism became official policy, and Albania was declared the world's first atheist state. Town and city names which echoed Abrahamic religious themes were abandoned for neutral secular ones, as well as personal names. During this period religiously based names were also made illegal. The \"Dictionary of People's Names\", published in 1982, contained 3,000 approved, secular names. In 1992, Monsignor Dias, the Papal Nuncio for Albania appointed by Pope John Paul II, said that of the three hundred Catholic priests present in Albania prior to the Communists coming to power, only thirty were still active. Promotion of religion was banned and all clerics were outlawed as reactionaries. Those religious figures who refused to embrace the principles of Marxism–Leninism were either arrested or carried on their activities in hiding.\n\nEnver Hoxha had declared during the anti-religious campaign that \"the only religion of Albania is Albanianism\", a quotation from the poem \"O moj Shqiperi\" (\"O Albania\") by the 19th-century Albanian writer Pashko Vasa.\n\nMuzafer Korkuti, one of the dominant figures in post-war Albanian archaeology and now Director of the Institute of Archaeology in Tirana, said this in an interview on 10 July 2002:\n\nEfforts were focused on an Illyrian-Albanian continuity issue.\nAn Illyrian origin of the Albanians (without denying \"Pelasgian\" roots) continued to play a significant role in Albanian nationalism, resulting in a revival of given names supposedly of \"Illyrian\" origin, at the expense of given names associated with Christianity. At first, Albanian nationalist writers opted for the Pelasgians as the forefathers of the Albanians, but as this form of nationalism flourished in Albania under Enver Hoxha, the Pelasgians became a secondary element to the Illyrian theory of Albanian origins, which could claim some support in scholarship.\n\nThe Illyrian descent theory soon became one of the pillars of Albanian nationalism, especially because it could provide some evidence of continuity of an Albanian presence both in Kosovo and Southern Albania, i.e., areas that were subject to ethnic conflicts between Albanians, Serbs and Greeks. Under the government of Enver Hoxha, an autochthonous ethnogenesis was promoted and physical anthropologists tried to demonstrate that Albanians were different from any other Indo-European populations, a theory now disproved.\nThey claimed that the Illyrians were the most ancient people in the Balkans and greatly extended the age of the Illyrian language.\n\nHoxha and his government were hostile to Western (American and British-led) popular culture as it manifested in the mass media, along with the consumerism and social liberalism associated with it. In a speech on the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee of the PLA (PLA-CC) on 26 June 1973, Hoxha declared a definitive break from any such Western bourgeois influence and what he described as its \"degenerated bourgeois culture\". In a speech in which he also criticised the \"spread of certain vulgar, alien tastes in music and art\", which ran \"contrary to socialist ethics and the positive traditions of our people\", including \"degenerate importations such as long hair, extravagant dress, screaming jungle music, coarse language, shameless behaviour and so on\", Hoxha declared; \n\nA new Constitution was decided upon by the Seventh Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour on 1–7 November 1976. According to Hoxha, \"The old Constitution was the Constitution of the building of the foundations of socialism, whereas the new Constitution will be the Constitution of the complete construction of a socialist society.\"\n\nSelf-reliance was now stressed more than ever. Citizens were encouraged to train in the use of weapons, and this activity was also taught in schools. This was to encourage the creation of quick partisans.\n\nBorrowing and foreign investment were banned under Article 26 of the Constitution, which read: \"The granting of concessions to, and the creation of foreign economic and financial companies and other institutions or ones formed jointly with bourgeois and revisionist capitalist monopolies and states as well as obtaining credits from them are prohibited in the People's Socialist Republic of Albania.\" Hoxha said of borrowing money and allowing investment from other countries:\nDuring this period Albania was the most isolated and poorest country in Europe and socially backwards by European standards. It had the lowest standard of living in Europe. However, as a result of economic self-sufficiency, Albania had a minimal foreign debt. In 1983, Albania imported goods worth $280 million but exported goods worth $290 million, producing a trade surplus of $10 million.\n\nIn 1981, Hoxha ordered the execution of several party and government officials in a new purge. Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu, the second-most powerful man in Albania and Hoxha's closest comrade-in-arms for 40 years, was reported to have committed suicide in December 1981. He was subsequently condemned as a \"traitor\" to Albania and was also accused of operating in the service of multiple intelligence agencies. It is generally believed that he was either killed or shot himself during a power struggle or over differing foreign policy matters with Hoxha. Hoxha also wrote a large assortment of books during this period, resulting in over 65 volumes of collected works, condensed into six volumes of selected works.\nHoxha suffered a heart attack in 1973 from which he never fully recovered. In increasingly precarious health from the late 1970s onward, he turned most state functions over to Ramiz Alia. In his final days he was confined to a wheelchair and suffering from diabetes, which had developed in 1948, and cerebral ischemia, from which he had suffered since 1983. On 9 April 1985, he was struck by ventricular fibrillation. Over the next forty-eight hours, he had repeated episodes of this arrhythmia, and he died in the early morning of 11 April 1985 at the age of 76. He was succeeded by Ramiz Alia.\n\nHoxha's death left Albania with a legacy of isolation and fear of the outside world. Despite some economic progress made by Hoxha, the country was in economic stagnation; Albania had been the poorest European country throughout much of the Cold War period. Following the transition to capitalism in 1992, Hoxha's legacy diminished, so that by the early 21st century very little of it was still in place in Albania.\n\nThe surname \"Hoxha\" is the Albanian variant of Hodja (from ), a title given to his ancestors due to their efforts to teach Albanians about Islam. In addition, among the population, he was widely known by his nickname of \"Dulla\", a short form for the Muslim name Abdullah stemming from his Muslim roots.\n\nHoxha's parents were Halil and Gjylihan (Gjylo) Hoxha, and Hoxha had three sisters named Fahrije, Haxhire and Sanije. Hysen Hoxha () was Enver Hoxha's uncle and was a militant who campaigned vigorously for the independence of Albania, which occurred when Enver was four years old. His grandfather Beqir was involved in the Gjirokastër section of the League of Prizren.\n\nHoxha's son Sokol Hoxha was the CEO of the Albanian Post and Telecommunication service and is married to Liliana Hoxha. The later democratic president of Albania Sali Berisha was often seen socializing with Sokol Hoxha and other close relatives of leading communist figures in Albania.\n\nHoxha's daughter, Pranvera, is an architect. Along with her husband, Klement Kolaneci, she designed the Enver Hoxha Museum in Tirana, a white-tiled pyramid. Some sources have referred to the edifice, said to be the most expensive ever constructed in Albanian history, as the \"Enver Hoxha Mausoleum\", though this was not an official appellation. The museum opened in 1988, three years after her father's death, and in 1991 was transformed into a conference centre and exhibition venue renamed Pyramid of Tirana.\n\nBanda Mustafaj was a group of four Albanian émigrés, led by Xhevdet Mustafa, who wanted to assassinate Enver Hoxha in 1982. The gang was connected to counter-revolutionary elements such as the Albanian mafia and members of the royal House of Zogu. The plan failed and two of its members were killed and another one was arrested. It marked the only real effort to kill Hoxha.\n\n\n\n"}

He was briefly president of the short-lived First Spanish Republic in 1873.\n\nPi was the son of a working-class textile worker in Barcelona and was born on 29 April 1824. Pi's father enrolled him in a religious school in 1831 where he acquired an education in the humanities and the classics. He was a member of the \"Societat Filomàtica\", enabling him to meet some of the main thinkers and writers of the Catalan romanticist movement. In 1837, he left to study law, graduating with a law degree in 1847. He moved to Madrid that year and began writing as a theater critic for the journal \"El Renacimiento\" and for \"El Correo,\" in which Pi's first political article was published. In need of further income, Pi also took a job for Martí, a Catalan bank.\n\nIn 1848, Pi completed the unfinished \"Memories and Beauties of Spain\" by the poet Pau Piferrer, contributing to the sections on Catalonia, Seville, and Granada. At this time, he connected himself with the Republican faction in Spanish politics. In 1851, he wrote a monumental and highly popular history of painting, though it was eventually condemned by the Church and the Spanish state for heterodoxy.\n\nPi was involved in the revolution of 1854 that brought the liberal caudillo Baldomero Espartero, Count of Luchana back to power. He published \"La reacción y la revolución\" in that year, influenced by G.W.F. Hegel's philosophy of history and the thinking of the French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. In 1856 he established a new journal, \"La Razón\", that was closed when the moderate O'Donnell government was overthrown by the reactionary Ramón María Narváez, 1st Duke of Valencia. Pi fled to Guipúzcoa in the Basque country until 1857, when Nicolás María Rivero asked him to return to Madrid to contribute to the Republican newspaper \"La Discusión\". At \"La Discusión\", Pi became acquainted with a number of leaders of the Spanish republican movement, including another future president of the First Republic, Estanislau Figueras i de Moragas. In 1864 he became the director of the newspaper.\n\nAfter the sergeants' revolt at San Gil in 1866, Pi fled to Paris, where he gave lectures and translated several of Proudhon's works and became familiar with French positivism. He developed ideas about revolutions and the philosophy of history, including a belief in an inevitable, progressive, and permanent movement in history toward greater freedom, embodied in federal constitutions. Throughout his life he would promote republicanism and social objectives through the federal idea.\n\nPi returned from Paris in 1868 after the success of the Glorious Revolution. He was elected deputy on behalf of Barcelona and was part of the Cortes that wrote the Spanish Constitution of 1869. During this time Pi became respected as a leader of the Republican party in the Cortes; he is officially named the head of the party in March 1870. He was replaced shortly thereafter by internal strife over the party's policy toward the Paris Commune, conciliatory policy toward opposition groups, and electoral setbacks. He continued to adamantly promote the establishment of a federal republic in place of a monarchy. He opposed the liberal monarchy of King Amadeo I of Spain during its short rule.\n\nWhen the First Spanish Republic was established in 1873 after the abdication of King Amadeo, the first president, Estanislao Figueras, named Pi Minister of the Interior. During his tenure as Interior Minister, Pi was responsible for the struggle against the \"cantonalist\" movement in the provinces. On Figueras's resignation on 11 June, Pi was named president. Pi presented to the Cortes an ambitious plan of reform, including a law formalizing a stricter separation of church and state, the reorganization of the army, reduction of the working day to eight hours, regulation of child labor, enhancements to the relationship between business and labor, new laws regarding the autonomy of the regions of Spain, and a program of universal education. His acquaintance with Proudhon enabled Pi to warm relations between the Republicans and the socialists in Spain. However, Pi was unable to rein in the instability of the Republic; on the 1 July, the more radical elements of the Republican party and federalists broke off and declared the government illegitimate, and new insurrections appeared in Alcoy and Cartagena only a week later. Under pressure from the Cortes and many leading Republicans who accused him of dangerous weakness, Pi resigned the presidency on 18 July, only a little more than a month after he assumed the office.\n\nAfter the end of the Republic in 1874, Pi left political life for a decade. During this time, he returned his attentions to his writings; only a few months after the end of the Republic, he wrote a treatise on its events, \"La República de 1873\". He followed this with \"Las Nacionalidades\" and \"Joyas Literarias\" in 1876. The first volume of his \"Historia General de América\" was published in 1878, \"La Federación\" in 1880, and \"Las luchas de nuestros días\" and \"Observaciones sobre el carácter de don Juan Tenorio\" in 1884. In 1886, he returned to politics and was elected deputy for Figueres, in Catalonia, and again in 1891 and 1893. He was involved in the fragmentation of the Spanish Republican movement in this period together with Estanislao Figueras, Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, Emilio Castelar y Ripoll, and Valentí Almirall. Pi was involved in the 1883 Republican Congress of Zaragoza that proposed a federal republican constitution for Spain; in 1894, he was instrumental in reforming the republican movement with a new manifesto for the Federal Party. In 1890, Pi founded the newspaper \"El Nuevo Régimen\", which campaigned for Cuban independence. Pi's promotion of federalism and regional autonomy earned him popularity among Catalan anarchists. He was also a supporter of Iberian Federalism.\n\nPi died in Madrid on 29 November 1901.\n\nPi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock, \"These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's.\" According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" \"During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi i Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or “cantonalist,” political system on Proudhonian lines.\"\n\nPi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book-length works such as \"La reacción y la revolución\" (en:\"Reaction and revolution\" from 1855), \"Las nacionalidades\" (en:\"Nationalities\" from 1877), and \"La Federación\" from 1880. For prominent anarcho-syndicalist Rudolf Rocker \"The first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi i Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi i Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of libertarian ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of Richard Price, Joseph Priestly (sic), Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Wrapping paper is a kind of paper designed for gift wrapping. An alternative to gift wrapping is using a gift box or bag. A wrapped or boxed gift may be held closed with ribbon and topped with a decorative bow (an ornamental knot made of ribbon).\n\nThe use of wrapping paper is first documented in ancient China, where paper was invented in 2nd century BC. In the Southern Song dynasty, monetary gifts were wrapped with paper, forming an envelope known as a \"chih pao\". The wrapped gifts were distributed by the Chinese court to government officials. In the Chinese text \"Thien Kung Khai Wu\", Sung Ying-Hsing states that the coarsest wrapping paper is manufactured with rice straws and bamboo fiber. \n\nAlthough the Hall brothers Rollie and Joyce Hall, founders of Hallmark Cards, did not invent gift wrapping, their innovations led to the development of modern gift wrapping. They helped to popularize the idea of decorative gift wrapping in the 20th century, and according to Joyce Hall, \"the decorative gift-wrapping business was born the day Rollie placed those French envelope linings on top of that showcase.\"\n\nGift wrapping has been shown to positively influence the recipient who are more likely to rate their gifts positively if they had traditional gift wrapping.\n\nIn Western culture, gifts are often wrapped in wrapping paper and accompanied by a gift note which may note the occasion, the receiver's name and the giver's name.\n\nModern patterned wrapping paper was introduced to the American market by the Hall Brothers in 1917. The Kansas City stationery store had run out of traditional white, red, and green monocolor tissue papers, and started selling colorful envelope liners from France. Proving popular, the company promoted the new designs in the subsequent decades, adding ribbons in the 1930s, and Hallmark remains one of the largest American producers of gift wrap.\n\nIn the United States, an additional five million tons of waste are generated over the Christmas gift-giving period; four million tons of this is wrapping paper and shopping bags. Some people attempt to avoid this by unwrapping gifts with care to hopefully allow the paper to be reused, while others use decorated cloth gift sacks that can be easily reused many times; both of these concepts are part of the Green Gifting trend that encourages recycling. Additionally, some people use old newspapers instead of wrapping paper.\n\nIn Chinese culture, red wrapping denotes luck.\n\nIn Japanese culture, wrapping paper and boxes are common. However, the traditional cloth wrapping called \"furoshiki\" is increasing in popularity, particularly as an ecologically friendly alternative to wrapping paper.\n\nIn Korean culture, \"bojagi\" are sometimes used for gift wrapping. A \"yedanbo\" is a ceremonial gift bojagi used to wrap wedding gifts from the bride's family to the members of the groom's.\n"}

It may refer to the spirit of any living creature as well as forms animate or not, such as land, rocks, plants, animals, and humans. All objects contained \"hanitu\". n Malay and Indonesian, the term for ghost, \"hantu\", may be of related origin.\n\nAs opposed to other religions and belief systems, multiple spirits can exist in one object/creature, as in the case of humans. They believed bad souls brought illness. With the adoption of Christianity these terms changed, with \"makuang\" being equated to \"devil\". Nevertheless, some scholars believe the native concepts were not replaced, but rather Christian thought was \"added on\". Strength of hanitu were innate.\n\n\"Hanitu\" or \"hanidu\" is derived from Proto-Austronesian \"*qaNiCu\" (\"ghost\", \"spirit of the dead\"). In other Austronesian cultures, cognates of \"hanitu\" include the Filipino and Tao \"anito\", Malaysian and Indonesian \"hantu\" or \"antu\", Polynesian \"aitu\" and \"aitu\", and Micronesian \"aniti\".\n\nThe land contained spirits before human habitation, and governed hunting, agriculture, and inhabitation. There were human spirit mediums who communicated with these formless \"hanitu\".\n\nObjects, such as guns, had formless \"hanitu\". The \"hanitu\" of such objects were 'invited' by ritual to take lives of animals and people. It was believed a person could not force a gun to take a life, that it was the work of the \"hanitu\" of the gun. If the killing was not intentional, the shooter was not seen as guilty, rather the gun itself was evil, and would be buried.\n\nHuman hanitu came from the father. There was a formless hanitu on each shoulder, as well as an \"isang\" or soul in the middle of the chest. The \"isang\" was unrelated to the parents. The Bunun believed that each person had two spirits, one good/amicable/communal (\"masial\") one bad/irritable/self-serving (\"makuang\"), but the ultimate arbiter was the \"isang\"/soul, which grew stronger with maturity and taboo observance. These would leave after death, and could act independently of the person's will, and could cause conflict or indecisiveness. The hanitu left the body during dreams, and could communicate with other hanitu during dreams (incl. objects).\n\n\"Hanitu\" of ancestors depended upon how descendents treated them during life. Violent death could cause wandering spirits. These \"hanitu\" were fed but not worshipped.\n\n\"Hanitu\" with no set abode were malevolent spirits that have specific forms, and could produce objects such as bamboo needles to stab people and cause disease, or scare out the soul (isang) from a person, who would then die if the soul was gone too long. Qanasilis were giant spirits, Mamantainga were big-eared spirits with giant torsos who like to eat children. Spirit mediatiors could negotiate \"palinanutu hanitu\" with agitators to heal disease.\n\n\"Hanitu\" were believed to dwell in a homeland to the west, named \"Lamungan\" or \"Mai-asang\", to which they returned upon the death of an animate being.\n\n"}
{"id": "920575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=920575", "title": "Hippasus", "text": "Hippasus\n\nHippasus of Metapontum (; , \"Híppasos\"; fl. 5th century BC), was a Pythagorean philosopher. Little is known about his life or his beliefs, but he is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers. The discovery of irrational numbers is said to have been shocking to the Pythagoreans, and Hippasus is supposed to have drowned at sea, apparently as a punishment from the gods for divulging this. However, the few ancient sources which describe this story either do not mention Hippasus by name (e.g. Pappus) or alternatively tell that Hippasus drowned because he revealed how to construct a dodecahedron inside a sphere. The discovery of irrationality is not specifically ascribed to Hippasus by any ancient writer. Some modern scholars though have suggested that he discovered the irrationality of , which is believed to have been discovered around the time that he lived.\n\nLittle is known about the life of Hippasus. He may have lived in the late 5th century BC, about a century after the time of Pythagoras. Metapontum in Italy (Magna Graecia) is usually referred to as his birthplace, although according to Iamblichus some claim Metapontum to be his birthplace, while others the nearby city of Croton. Hippasus is recorded under the city of Sybaris in Iamblichus list of each city's Pythagoreans. He also states that Hippasus was the founder of a sect of the Pythagoreans called the \"Mathematici\" () in opposition to the \"Acusmatici\" (); but elsewhere he makes him the founder of the \"Acusmatici\" in opposition to the \"Mathematici\".\n\nIamblichus says about the death of Hippasus\n\nAccording to Iamblichus (ca. 245-325 AD, 1918 translation) in \"The life of Pythagoras\", by Thomas Taylor\n\nAristotle speaks of Hippasus as holding the element of fire to be the cause of all things; and Sextus Empiricus contrasts him with the Pythagoreans in this respect, that he believed the \"arche\" to be material, whereas they thought it was incorporeal, namely, number. Diogenes Laërtius tells us that Hippasus believed that \"there is a definite time which the changes in the universe take to complete, and that the universe is limited and ever in motion.\" According to one statement, Hippasus left no writings, according to another he was the author of the \"Mystic Discourse\", written to bring Pythagoras into disrepute.\n\nA scholium on Plato's \"Phaedo\" notes him as an early experimenter in music theory, claiming that he made use of bronze disks to discover the fundamental musical ratios, 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1.\n\nHippasus is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers, following which he was drowned at sea. Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of integers, and the discovery of irrational numbers is said to have shocked them. However, the evidence linking the discovery to Hippasus is confused.\n\nPappus merely says that the knowledge of irrational numbers originated in the Pythagorean school, and that the member who first divulged the secret perished by drowning. Iamblichus gives a series of inconsistent reports. In one story he explains how a Pythagorean was merely expelled for divulging the nature of the irrational; but he then cites the legend of the Pythagorean who drowned at sea for making known the construction of the regular dodecahedron in the sphere. In another account he tells how it was Hippasus who drowned at sea for betraying the construction of the dodecahedron and taking credit for this construction himself; but in another story this same punishment is meted out to the Pythagorean who divulged knowledge of the irrational. Iamblichus clearly states that the drowning at sea was a punishment from the gods for impious behaviour.\n\nThese stories are usually taken together to ascribe the discovery of irrationals to Hippasus, but whether he did or not is uncertain. In principle, the stories can be combined, since it is possible to discover irrational numbers when constructing dodecahedrons. Irrationality, by infinite reciprocal subtraction, can be easily seen in the Golden ratio of the regular pentagon.\n\nSome modern scholars prefer to credit Hippasus with the discovery of the irrationality of . Plato in his \"Theaetetus\", describes how Theodorus of Cyrene (c. 400 BC) proved the irrationality of , , etc. up to , which implies that an earlier mathematician had already proved the irrationality of . Aristotle referred to the method for a proof of the irrationality of , and a full proof along these same lines is set out in the proposition interpolated at the end of Euclid's Book X, which suggests that the proof was certainly ancient. The method is a proof by contradiction, or reductio ad absurdum, which shows that, if the diagonal of a square is assumed to be commensurable with the side, then the same number must be both odd and even.\n\nIn the hands of modern writers this combination of vague ancient reports and modern guesswork has sometimes evolved into a much more emphatic and colourful tale. Some writers have Hippasus making his discovery while on board a ship, as a result of which his Pythagorean shipmates toss him overboard; while one writer even has Pythagoras himself \"to his eternal shame\" sentencing Hippasus to death by drowning, for showing \"that is an irrational number.\"\n\n\n"}

Most often, \"Julian laws\", \"Lex Iulia\" or \"Leges Iuliae\" refer to moral legislation introduced by Augustus in 23 BC, or to a law from the dictatorship of Julius Caesar.\n\nApart from Augustus's laws on marriage, this 90 BC Lex Julia is probably the best known of the laws under this name. It was introduced by the consul Lucius Julius Caesar. It granted Roman citizenship to all citizens of Italic towns which had not raised arms against Rome in the Social War (91–88 BC). This war was a rebellion against Rome by some of her Italic socii (allies) which was caused by Rome's refusal to grant them Roman citizenship. During the war, the Roman introduced this law which granted Roman citizenship to those who had not taken part in the war (especially Etruria and Umbria) to prevent them from joining the rebellion. The next year, the Romans introduced the de Civitate Sociis Danda, which granted Roman citizenship to the allies which had rebelled, in an attempt to stem the rebellion. \n\nThis law restricted the number of 'gifts' that a governor could receive during his term in a province, and also ensured that governors balanced their accounts before leaving a province.\n\nSets regulations for the Italian municipalities.

They also established adultery as a private and public crime (\"Lex Julia de adulteriis\").\n\nTo encourage population expansion, the Leges Juliae offered inducements to marriage and imposed disabilities upon the celibate. Augustus instituted the \"Law of the three sons\" which held those in high regard who produced three male offspring. Marrying-age celibates and young widows who wouldn't marry were prohibited from receiving inheritances and from attending public games.\n\n\nThe extracts below are from later legal codes and textbooks, but are also valuable in the sense that they are based on, and frequently quote from, the actual text of Augustus' laws.\n\nAs written down by Ulpian\n\nUnder the rule of Emperor Justinian\n\n\n"}

In this period, Ceruti produced on the latter topic an in-depth study and interpretation, which was published later in a book that he wrote together with Gianluca Bocchi.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1986 Ceruti worked at the University of Geneva, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, and at the Genetic Epistemology International Centre founded by Jean Piaget. In these years, he developed the definition of an innovative research line within Philosophy of Science, based on analyses and elaborations of the epistemological implications of the Evolutionary Sciences. Within this framework, Ceruti developed a research program in Evolutionary Epistemology that draws on contemporary theories of biological evolution, history of ideas and genetic psychology.\n\nStarting from the 80s, Ceruti had been collaborating with Alberto Munari and Donata Fabbri at the Cultural Psychology Center of Geneva, Ilya Prigogine at Université Libre of Brussels, Henri Atlan and Francisco Varela at CREA (Research Center in Applied Epistemology, Paris), Jean-Louis Le Moigne at the MCX (Modelisation of Complexity) Program, and Ervin Laszlo and GERG (General Evolution Research Group, San Diego).\n\nBetween 1986 and 1993, Ceruti started to collaborate with Edgar Morin at the CETSAP (Research Center in Transdisciplinary Studies, Sociology, Anthropology, Politics, Paris), developing and expanding his Evolutionary Epistemology project to create a new trans-disciplinary research program, dedicated to structure an Anthropology and Epistemology of Complex Systems, as well as a Complex Anthropology and Epistemology.\n\nSince 1985 Ceruti has been organizing a series of symposia, as well as structuring a wide research network on the main research topics of the emerging Sciences of Complex Systems. They included, besides the already mentioned pioneers of these domains of inquiry, also Jerome Bruner, Heinz von Foerster, Ernst von Glasersfeld, Susan Oyama, Isabelle Stengers, William Thompson, Lynn Margulis, James Lovelock, Stephen J. Gould, Niles Eldredge, Brian Goodwin, Evan Thompson, Giulio Giorello, Paul Feyerabend, Paul Watzlawick, and René Thom, among others. These collaborations and synergies found their expression in collective publications, among which is \"La sfida della complessità\". This work, edited by Ceruti with Gianluca Bocchi, initiated in Italy one of the most relevant philosophical debates of the last decades, and, at the international level, contributed to connect innovative lines of inquiry within the Sciences of Complex Systems in a unitary trans-disciplinary research direction that, since the late 80s, is commonly called “Epistemology of Complex Systems”. Together with Ceruti’s following books, this work stimulated epistemological reflections on the paradigms of contemporary sciences, and the emergence of new research perspectives in many different disciplines and social practices: from Architecture to Sociology and Anthropology, from Clinical Psychology to Management and Organization Sciences, from Educational Sciences to the Cognitive Sciences and Philosophy of Mind, from History to the Sciences of Globalization.\n\nBetween the 80s and the 90s Ceruti founded and directed three scientific journals dedicated to the development of “Complex Thinking”: \"La Casa di Dedalo, Oikos\" and \"Pluriverso.\"\n\nSince 1994 Ceruti has been Professor in the domain of Epistemology and Philosophy of Science in different Italian universities: the University of Parma, the Polytechnic of Milan, the University of Palermo, the Bicocca University of Milan, the University of Bergamo (where he founded the Research Center on Complex Systems CERCO, as well as a Doctoral School in Anthropology and Epistemology of Complex Systems), and the IULM University of Milan.\n\nCurrently he is member of the following Scientific Committees and Advisory Boards:\n\n"}

(27 September 1648 – 28 February 1730) was an Italian Jesuit, who was elected fourteenth Superior General of the Society of Jesus from January 31, 1706 to February 28, 1730.\nAfter having taught Scholastic philosophy and theology for twelve years, he was successively made rector of several colleges, was chosen by Cardinal Reynold of Este as his private theologian, held the offices of secretary general and vicar to Thyrsus Gonzalez, and finally, on the latter's death, was elected general on 3 January 1706, a post which he occupied for 24 years.\n\nThe reputation for solid virtue, patience, and courage, which he had acquired in the different grades of his order, was by no means dimmed in the long years of his generalate. During Tamburini's superiorship, the apostolic activity of the Society was at its best; but, at the same time, could be seen signs of the storm which was, half a century later, to annihilate it.\n\nThe Reductions of Paraguay were beginning to bear fruit; missionaries were laying down their lives for the pest-stricken in the Levant or were pushing into the steppes of Tibet amid untold hardships. Peter the Great admitted the Jesuits into Russia. Jansenism, the Society's bitterest foe, received its death-blow in 1708 by a Bull of Clement XI ordering the suppression of Port-Royal. The destruction of Port Royal was coupled with the condemnation of the errors of Pasquier Quesnel by the papal bull \"Unigenitus\" (1711).\n\nThree Jesuits, Tolomei, Cienfuegos, and Salerno, were, in short succession, raised to the dignity of the cardinalate.\n\nAt this period the debate over the Chinese Rites was at its height. The Jesuit missionaries in China had been accused of not obeying the orders of the Pope. Tamburini, though naturally of a gentle disposition, could be firm when the honour of the Society was at stake. He protested energetically, and when in 1711 the procurators of all the provinces of the Society were assembled in Rome, he had them sign a protest which he dedicated to Pope Clement XI. In the name of all the assistants and procurators gathered at Rome, he protested the fidelity and obedience of the whole Society to the Vicar of Christ.\n\nIn France, the long reign of Louis XIV, so favorable to the Jesuits in many respects, saw the beginning of those hostile movements which were to lead to the suppression of the Order. This was seen at his death, 1715, when the regent banished the once influential father confessor Le Tellier, while the gallicanizing archbishop of Paris, Cardinal de Noailles, laid them under an interdict (1716–1729).\n\nDuring his generalate the mission of Paraguay reached its highest degree of success; in one year no fewer than 77 missionaries left for it; the missionary labors of St. Francis de Geronimo and Blessed Anthony Baldinucci in Italy, and Venerable Manuel Padial in Spain, enhanced the reputation of the Society.\n\nTamburini died at the age of 82.\n"}

Christians were not to fight for conquest or personal glory.\n\nThe concepts of \"miles Christi\" and \"militia Christi\" can be traced back to the first century AD. The phrase \"miles Christi\", derived from a letter from Paul the Apostle and much employed by Pope Gregory VII, also appeared in the \"Gesta Francorum\" in reference to the young Prince Tancred, Bohemond, Godfrey and Count Raymond of Toulouse, each of whom were Christian leaders in the First Crusade.\n\nThe metaphor has its origins in early Christianity of the Roman Empire, and gave rise to the contrasting term \"paganus\" (hitherto used in the sense of \"civilian\", \"one lacking discipline\") for its opposite, i.e. one who was not a soldier of Christ.\n\nChivalry as the idealized image of knighthood was a common moral allegory in early Christian literature. Knighthood emerged as a concept during the time of Charlemagne. During the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne's Christian knights attended mass, surrounded by relics, before battles.\n\nFragments from 15th c. Polish chronicler Jan Długosz describe the sanctification of weapons and a concept of knighthood that was grounded in religion. It became a theme in art during the High Middle Ages, with depictions of a knight with his various pieces of equipment identified with various virtues. This parallels the development of the understanding in medieval Christendom of the armed nobility as defenders of the faith, first emphasized by Gregory VII in the context of the Investiture controversy and later made even more explicit with the actual military expeditions of the crusades. \nDepictions of the \"miles christianus\" with the emblematic Armour of God however remained very rare in the medieval period and only became prominent after the Protestant Reformation.\n\nIn the early modern period, the understanding of the term again became more metaphorical, but it survives in various Christian orders or confessions; it is especially pronounced among the Jesuits and in the Salvation Army, and it is the central theme of the 18th century hymn \"Soldiers of Christ, Arise\" and the 19th century hymn \"Onward, Christian Soldiers.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Zen and Daoist meditators are said to reach this state, as well as artists and trained martial artists. They also practice this mental state during everyday activities.\n\nThe term contains the character for negation, \"not\" or \"without\" (無), along with the character for heart-mind (心). The term is shortened from , a Zen expression meaning \"the mind without mind\" and is also referred to as the state of \"no-mindness\". That is, a mind not fixed or occupied by thought or emotion and thus open to everything. It is translated by D.T. Suzuki as \"being free from mind-attachment\". \n\nMushin is achieved when a person's mind is free from thoughts of anger, fear, or ego during combat or everyday life. There is an absence of discursive thought and judgment, so the person is totally free to act and react towards an opponent without hesitation and without disturbance from such thoughts. At this point, a person relies not on what they \"think\" should be the next move, but what is their trained natural reaction (or instinct) or what is \"felt\" intuitively. It is not a state of relaxed, near-sleepfulness, however. The mind could be said to be working at a very high speed, but with no intention, plan or direction.\n\nSome masters believe that mushin is the state where a person finally understands the uselessness of techniques and becomes truly free to move. In fact, those people will no longer even consider themselves as \"fighters\" but merely living beings moving through space.\n\nThe legendary Zen master Takuan Sōhō said:\n\nThe mind must always be in the state of 'flowing,' for when it stops anywhere that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of the swordsman, it means death.<br> \nWhen the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy's sword movements. He just stands there with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes.\n\nHowever, mushin is not just a state of mind that can be achieved during combat. Many martial artists train to achieve this state of mind during kata so that a flawless execution of moves is accomplished — that they may be achieved during combat or at any other time. Once mushin is attained through the practice or study of martial arts (although it can be accomplished through other arts or practices that refine the mind and body), the objective is to then attain this same level of complete awareness in other aspects of the practitioner's life.\n\n"}
{"id": "39807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39807", "title": "Nature versus nurture", "text": "Nature versus nurture\n\nThe nature versus nurture debate involves whether human behavior is determined by the environment, either prenatal or during a person's life, or by a person's genes. The alliterative expression \"nature and nurture\" in English has been in use since at least the Elizabethan period and goes back to medieval French.\nThe combination of the two concepts as complementary is ancient (Greek: ). Nature is what we think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance and other biological factors. Nurture is generally taken as the influence of external factors after conception e.g. the product of exposure, experience and learning on an individual.\n\nThe phrase in its modern sense was popularized by the English Victorian polymath Francis Galton, the modern founder of eugenics and behavioral genetics, discussing the influence of heredity and environment on social advancement. Galton was influenced by the book \"On the Origin of Species\" written by his half-cousin, Charles Darwin.\n\nThe view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from \"nurture\" was termed \"tabula rasa\" (\"blank slate\") by John Locke in 1690. A \"blank slate view\" in human developmental psychology assuming that human behavioral traits develop almost exclusively from environmental influences, was widely held during much of the 20th century (sometimes termed \"blank-slatism\").\nThe debate between \"blank-slate\" denial of the influence of heritability, and the view admitting both environmental and heritable traits, has often been cast in terms of nature \"versus\" nurture. These two conflicting approaches to human development were at the core of an ideological dispute over research agendas throughout the second half of the 20th century. As both \"nature\" and \"nurture\" factors were found to contribute substantially, often in an extricable manner, such views were seen as naive or outdated by most scholars of human development by the 2000s.\n\nThe strong dichotomy of nature \"versus\" nurture has thus been claimed to have limited relevance in some fields of research. Close feedback loops have been found in which \"nature\" and \"nurture\" influence one another constantly, as seen in self-domestication. In ecology and behavioral genetics, researchers think nurture has an essential influence on nature. Similarly in other fields, the dividing line between an inherited and an acquired trait becomes unclear, as in epigenetics or fetal development.\n\nJohn Locke's \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690) is often cited as the foundational document of the \"blank slate\" view. Locke was criticizing René Descartes's claim of an innate idea of God universal to humanity.\nLocke's view was harshly criticized in his own time. Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, complained that by denying the possibility of any innate ideas, \nLocke \"threw all order and virtue out of the world\", leading to total moral relativism.\nLocke's was not the predominant view in the 19th century, which on the contrary tended to focus on \"instinct\".\nLeda Cosmides and John Tooby noted that William James (1842–1910) argued that humans have \"more\" instincts than animals, and that greater freedom of action is the result of having more psychological instincts, not fewer.\n\nThe question of \"innate ideas\" or \"instincts\" were of some importance in the discussion of free will in moral philosophy. In 18th-century philosophy, this was cast in terms of \"innate ideas\" establishing the presence of a universal virtue, prerequisite for objective morals. In the 20th century, this argument was in a way inverted, as some philosophers now argued that the evolutionary origins of human behavioral traits forces us to concede that there is no foundation for ethics (J. L. Mackie), while others treat ethics as a field in complete isolation from evolutionary considerations (Thomas Nagel).\n\nIn the early 20th century, there was an increased interest in the role of the environment, as a reaction to the strong focus on pure heredity in the wake of the triumphal success of Darwin's theory of evolution.\n\nDuring this time, the social sciences developed as the project of studying the influence of culture in clean isolation from questions related to \"biology\".\nFranz Boas's \"The Mind of Primitive Man\" (1911) established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study he established that in any given population, biology, language, material and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another.\n\nThe tool of twin studies was developed as a research design intended to exclude all confounders based on inherited behavioral traits. Such studies are designed to decompose the variability of a given trait in a given population into a genetic and an environmental component.\n\nJohn B. Watson in the 1920s and 1930s established the school of purist behaviorism that would become dominant over the following decades. Watson is often said to have been convinced of the complete dominance of cultural influence over anything that heredity might contribute, based on the following quote which is frequently repeated without context:\n\nThe last sentence of the above quote is frequently omitted, leading to confusion about Watson's position. \n\nDuring the 1940s to 1960s, Ashley Montagu was a notable proponent of this purist form of behaviorism which allowed no contribution from heredity whatsoever: \n\nIn 1951, Calvin Hall suggested that the dichotomy opposing nature to nurture is ultimately fruitless.\n\nRobert Ardrey in the 1960s argued for innate attributes of human nature, especially concerning territoriality, in the widely read \"African Genesis\" (1961) and \"The Territorial Imperative\". Desmond Morris in \"The Naked Ape\" (1967) expressed similar views.\nOrganised opposition to Montagu's kind of purist \"blank-slatism\" began to pick up in the 1970s, notably led by E. O. Wilson (\"On Human Nature\" 1979).\nTwin studies established that there was, in many cases, a significant heritable component. \nThese results did not in any way point to overwhelming contribution of heritable factors, with heritability typically ranging around 40% to 50%, so that the controversy may not be cast in terms of purist behaviorism vs. purist nativism. Rather, it was purist behaviorism which was gradually replaced by the now-predominant view that both kinds of factors usually contribute to a given trait, anecdotally phrased by Donald Hebb as an answer to the question \"which, nature or nurture, contributes more to personality?\" by asking in response, \"Which contributes more to the area of a rectangle, its length or its width?\" \nIn a comparable avenue of research, anthropologist Donald Brown in the 1980s surveyed hundreds of anthropological studies from around the world and collected a set of cultural universals. He identified approximately 150 such features, coming to the conclusion there is indeed a \"universal human nature\", and that these features point to what that universal human nature is.\n\nAt the height of the controversy, during the 1970s to 1980s, the debate was highly ideologised. In \"\" (1984), Richard Lewontin, Steven Rose and Leon Kamin criticise \"genetic determinism\" from a Marxist framework, arguing that \"Science is the ultimate legitimator of bourgeois ideology ... If biological determinism is a weapon in the struggle between classes, then the universities are weapons factories, and their teaching and research faculties are the engineers, designers, and production workers.\" The debate thus shifted away from whether heritable traits exist to whether it was politically or ethically permissible to admit their existence. The authors deny this, requesting that evolutionary inclinations be discarded in ethical and political discussions regardless of whether they exist or not.\n\nHeritability studies became much easier to perform, and hence much more numerous, with the advances of genetic studies during the 1990s. By the late 1990s, an overwhelming amount of evidence had accumulated that amounts to a refutation of the extreme forms of \"blank-slatism\" advocated by Watson or Montagu.\n\nThis revised state of affairs was summarized in books aimed at a popular audience from the late 1990s. In \"\" (1998), Judith Rich Harris was heralded by Steven Pinker as a book that \"will come to be seen as a turning point in the history of psychology\".\nbut Harris was criticized for exaggerating the point of \"parental upbringing seems to matter less than previously thought\" to the implication that \"parents do not matter\".\n\nThe situation as it presented itself by the end of the 20th century was summarized in \"\" (2002) by Steven Pinker. The book became a best-seller, and was instrumental in bringing to the attention of a wider public the paradigm shift away from the behaviourist purism of the 1940s to 1970s that had taken place over the preceding decades. Pinker portrays the adherence to pure blank-slatism as an ideological dogma linked to two other dogmas found in the dominant view of human nature in the 20th century, which he termed \"noble savage\" (in the sense that people are born good and corrupted by bad influence) and \n\"ghost in the machine\" (in the sense that there is a human soul capable of moral choices completely detached from biology). Pinker argues that all three dogmas were held onto for an extended period even in the face of evidence because they were seen as \"desirable\" in the sense that if any human trait is purely conditioned by culture, any undesired trait (such as crime or aggression) may be engineered away by purely cultural (political means). Pinker focuses on reasons he assumes were responsible for unduly repressing evidence to the contrary, notably the fear of (imagined or projected) political or ideological consequences.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"heritability\" refers only to the degree of genetic variation between people on a trait. It does not refer to the degree to which a trait of a particular individual is due to environmental or genetic factors. The traits of an individual are always a complex interweaving of both. For an individual, even strongly genetically influenced, or \"obligate\" traits, such as eye color, assume the inputs of a typical environment during ontogenetic development (e.g., certain ranges of temperatures, oxygen levels, etc.).\n\nIn contrast, the \"heritability index\" statistically quantifies the extent to which variation \"between individuals\" on a trait is due to variation in the genes those individuals carry. In animals where breeding and environments can be controlled experimentally, heritability can be determined relatively easily. Such experiments would be unethical for human research. This problem can be overcome by finding existing populations of humans that reflect the experimental setting the researcher wishes to create.\n\nOne way to determine the contribution of genes and environment to a trait is to study twins. In one kind of study, identical twins reared apart are compared to randomly selected pairs of people. The twins share identical genes, but different family environments. In another kind of twin study, identical twins reared together (who share family environment and genes) are compared to fraternal twins reared together (who also share family environment but only share half their genes). Another condition that permits the disassociation of genes and environment is adoption. In one kind of adoption study, biological siblings reared together (who share the same family environment and half their genes) are compared to adoptive siblings (who share their family environment but none of their genes).\n\nIn many cases, it has been found that genes make a substantial contribution, including psychological traits such as intelligence and personality. Yet heritability may differ in other circumstances, for instance environmental deprivation. Examples of low, medium, and high heritability traits include:\n\nTwin and adoption studies have their methodological limits. For example, both are limited to the range of environments and genes which they sample. Almost all of these studies are conducted in Western, first-world countries, and therefore cannot be extrapolated globally to include poorer, non-western populations. Additionally, both types of studies depend on particular assumptions, such as the equal environments assumption in the case of twin studies, and the lack of pre-adoptive effects in the case of adoption studies.\n\nSince the definition of \"nature\" in this context is tied to \"heritability\", the definition of \"nurture\" has necessarily become very wide, including any type of causality that is not heritable. The term has thus moved away from its original connotation of \"cultural influences\" to include all effects of the environment, including; indeed, a substantial source of environmental input to human nature may arise from stochastic variations in prenatal development and is thus in no sense of the term \"cultural\".\n\nHeritability refers to the origins of differences between people. Individual development, even of highly heritable traits, such as eye color, depends on a range of environmental factors, from the other genes in the organism, to physical variables such as temperature, oxygen levels etc. during its development or ontogenesis.\n\nThe variability of trait can be meaningfully spoken of as being due in certain proportions to genetic differences (\"nature\"), or environments (\"nurture\"). For highly penetrant Mendelian genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease virtually all the incidence of the disease is due to genetic differences. Huntington's animal models live much longer or shorter lives depending on how they are cared for .\n\nAt the other extreme, traits such as native language are environmentally determined: linguists have found that any child (if capable of learning a language at all) can learn any human language with equal facility. With virtually all biological and psychological traits, however, genes and environment work in concert, communicating back and forth to create the individual.\n\nAt a molecular level, genes interact with signals from other genes and from the environment. While there are many thousands of single-gene-locus traits, so-called complex traits are due to the additive effects of many (often hundreds) of small gene effects. A good example of this is height, where variance appears to be spread across many hundreds of loci.\n\nExtreme genetic or environmental conditions can predominate in rare circumstances—if a child is born mute due to a genetic mutation, it will not learn to speak any language regardless of the environment; similarly, someone who is practically certain to eventually develop Huntington's disease according to their genotype may die in an unrelated accident (an environmental event) long before the disease will manifest itself.\n\nSteven Pinker likewise described several examples:\n\nWhen traits are determined by a complex interaction of genotype and environment it is possible to measure the heritability of a trait within a population. However, many non-scientists who encounter a report of a trait having a certain percentage heritability imagine non-interactional, additive contributions of genes and environment to the trait. As an analogy, some laypeople may think of the degree of a trait being made up of two \"buckets,\" genes and environment, each able to hold a certain capacity of the trait. But even for intermediate heritabilities, a trait is always shaped by both genetic dispositions and the environments in which people develop, merely with greater and lesser plasticities associated with these heritability measures.\n\nHeritability measures always refer to the degree of \"variation between individuals in a population\". That is, as these statistics cannot be applied at the level of the individual, it would be incorrect to say that while the heritability index of personality is about 0.6, 60% of one's personality is obtained from one's parents and 40% from the environment. To help to understand this, imagine that all humans were genetic clones. The heritability index for all traits would be zero (all variability between clonal individuals must be due to environmental factors). And, contrary to erroneous interpretations of the heritability index, as societies become more egalitarian (everyone has more similar experiences) the heritability index goes up (as environments become more similar, variability between individuals is due more to genetic factors).\n\nOne should also take into account the fact that the variables of heritability and environmentality are not precise and vary within a chosen population and across cultures. It would be more accurate to state that the degree of heritability and environmentality is measured in its reference to a particular phenotype in a chosen group of a population in a given period of time. The accuracy of the calculations is further hindered by the number of coefficients taken into consideration, age being one such variable. The display of the influence of heritability and environmentality differs drastically across age groups: the older the studied age is, the more noticeable the heritability factor becomes, the younger the test subjects are, the more likely it is to show signs of strong influence of the environmental factors.\n\nSome have pointed out that environmental inputs affect the expression of genes (see the article on epigenetics). This is one explanation of how environment can influence the extent to which a genetic disposition will actually manifest. The interactions of genes with environment, called gene–environment interactions, are another component of the nature–nurture debate. A classic example of gene–environment interaction is the ability of a diet low in the amino acid phenylalanine to partially suppress the genetic disease phenylketonuria. Yet another complication to the nature–nurture debate is the existence of gene–environment correlations. These correlations indicate that individuals with certain genotypes are more likely to find themselves in certain environments. Thus, it appears that genes can shape (the selection or creation of) environments. Even using experiments like those described above, it can be very difficult to determine convincingly the relative contribution of genes and environment.\n\nA study conducted by T. J. Bouchard, Jr. showed data that has been evidence for the importance of genes when testing middle-aged twins reared together and reared apart. The results shown have been important evidence against the importance of environment when determining, happiness, for example. In the Minnesota study of twins reared apart, it was actually found that there was higher correlation for monozygotic twins reared apart (0.52)than monozygotic twins reared together (0.44). Also, highlighting the importance of genes, these correlations found much higher correlation among monozygotic than dizygotic twins that had a correlation of 0.08 when reared together and −0.02 when reared apart.\n\nThe social pre-wiring hypothesis refers to the ontogeny of social interaction. Also informally referred to as, \"wired to be social.\" The theory questions whether there is a propensity to socially oriented action already present \"before\" birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique genetic wiring to be social.\n\nCircumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.\n\nPrincipal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.\n\nThe social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, \"The central advance of this study is the demonstration that 'social actions' are already performed in the second trimester of gestation. Starting from the 14th week of gestation twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behavior: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.\".\n\nTraits may be considered to be adaptations (such as the umbilical cord), byproducts of adaptations (the belly button) or due to random variation (convex or concave belly button shape).\nAn alternative to contrasting nature and nurture focuses on \"obligate vs. facultative\" adaptations. Adaptations may be generally more obligate (robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or more facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation). For example, the rewarding sweet taste of sugar and the pain of bodily injury are obligate psychological adaptations—typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. On the other hand, facultative adaptations are somewhat like \"if-then\" statements. An example of a facultative psychological adaptation may be adult attachment style. The attachment style of adults, (for example, a \"secure attachment style,\" the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others) is proposed to be conditional on whether an individual's early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. An example of a facultative physiological adaptation is tanning of skin on exposure to sunlight (to prevent skin damage). Facultative social adaptation have also been proposed. For example, whether a society is warlike or peaceful has been proposed to be conditional on how much collective threat that society is experiencing .\n\nQuantitative studies of heritable traits throw light on the question.\n\nDevelopmental genetic analysis examines the effects of genes over the course of a human lifespan. Early studies of intelligence, which mostly examined young children, found that heritability measured 40–50%. Subsequent developmental genetic analyses found that variance attributable to additive environmental effects is less apparent in older individuals, with estimated heritability of IQ increasing in adulthood.\n\nMultivariate genetic analysis examines the genetic contribution to several traits that vary together. For example, multivariate genetic analysis has demonstrated that the genetic determinants of all specific cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, spatial reasoning, processing speed) overlap greatly, such that the genes associated with any specific cognitive ability will affect all others. Similarly, multivariate genetic analysis has found that genes that affect scholastic achievement completely overlap with the genes that affect cognitive ability.\n\nExtremes analysis examines the link between normal and pathological traits. For example, it is hypothesized that a given behavioral disorder may represent an extreme of a continuous distribution of a normal behavior and hence an extreme of a continuous distribution of genetic and environmental variation. Depression, phobias, and reading disabilities have been examined in this context.\n\nFor a few highly heritable traits, studies have identified loci associated with variance in that trait, for instance in some individuals with schizophrenia.\n\nThrough studies of identical twins separated at birth, one-third of their creative thinking abilities come from genetics and two-thirds come from learning. Research suggests that between 37 and 42 percent of the explained variance can be attributed to genetic factors. The learning primarily comes in the form of human capital transfers of entrepreneurial skills through parental role modeling. Other findings agree that the key to innovative entrepreneurial success comes from environmental factors and working “10,000 hours” to gain mastery in entrepreneurial skills.\n\nEvidence from behavioral genetic research suggests that family environmental factors may have an effect upon childhood IQ, accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. The American Psychological Association's report \"\" (1995) states that there is no doubt that normal child development requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Here, environment is playing a role in what is believed to be fully genetic (intelligence) but it was found that severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments have highly negative effects on many aspects of children's intellect development. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute. On the other hand, by late adolescence this correlation disappears, such that adoptive siblings no longer have similar IQ scores.\n\nMoreover, adoption studies indicate that, by adulthood, adoptive siblings are no more similar in IQ than strangers (IQ correlation near zero), while full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.6. Twin studies reinforce this pattern: monozygotic (identical) twins raised separately are highly similar in IQ (0.74), more so than dizygotic (fraternal) twins raised together (0.6) and much more than adoptive siblings (~0.0). Recent adoption studies also found that supportive parents can have a positive effect on the development of their children.\n\nPersonality is a frequently cited example of a heritable trait that has been studied in twins and adoptees using behavioral genetic study designs. The most famous categorical organization of heritable personality traits were created by Goldberg (1990) in which he had college students rate their personalities on 1400 dimensions to begin, and then narrowed these down into \"\"The Big Five\"\" factors of personality—Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The close genetic relationship between positive personality traits and, for example, our happiness traits are the mirror images of comorbidity in psychopathology. These personality factors were consistent across cultures, and many studies have also tested the heritability of these traits.\n\nIdentical twins reared apart are far more similar in personality than randomly selected pairs of people. Likewise, identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins. Also, biological siblings are more similar in personality than adoptive siblings. Each observation suggests that personality is heritable to a certain extent. A supporting article had focused on the heritability of personality (which is estimated to be around 50% for subjective well-being) in which a study was conducted using a representative sample of 973 twin pairs to test the heritable differences in subjective well-being which were found to be fully accounted for by the genetic model of the Five-Factor Model’s personality domains. However, these same study designs allow for the examination of environment as well as genes.\n\nAdoption studies also directly measure the strength of shared family effects. Adopted siblings share only family environment. Most adoption studies indicate that by adulthood the personalities of adopted siblings are little or no more similar than random pairs of strangers. This would mean that shared family effects on personality are zero by adulthood.\n\nIn the case of personality traits, non-shared environmental effects are often found to out-weigh shared environmental effects. That is, environmental effects that are typically thought to be life-shaping (such as family life) may have less of an impact than non-shared effects, which are harder to identify. One possible source of non-shared effects is the environment of pre-natal development. Random variations in the genetic program of development may be a substantial source of non-shared environment. These results suggest that \"nurture\" may not be the predominant factor in \"environment\". Environment and our situations, do in fact impact our lives, but not the way in which we would typically react to these environmental factors. We are preset with personality traits that are the basis for how we would react to situations. An example would be how extraverted prisoners become less happy than introverted prisoners and would react to their incarceration more negatively due to their preset extraverted personality. Behavioral genes are somewhat proven to exist when we take a look at fraternal twins. When fraternal twins are reared apart, they show the same similarities in behavior and response as if they have been reared together.\n\nThe relationship between personality and people's own well-being is influenced and mediated by genes (Weiss, Bates, & Luciano, 2008). There has been found to be a stable set point for happiness that is characteristic of the individual (largely determined by the individual's genes). Happiness fluctuates around that setpoint (again, genetically determined) based on whether good things or bad things are happening to us (\"nurture\"), but only fluctuates in small magnitude in a normal human. The midpoint of these fluctuations is determined by the \"great genetic lottery\" that people are born with, which leads them to conclude that how happy they may feel at the moment or over time is simply due to the luck of the draw, or gene. This fluctuation was also not due to educational attainment, which only accounted for less than 2% of the variance in well-being for women, and less than 1% of the variance for men.\n\nThey consider that the individualities measured together with personality tests remain steady throughout an individual’s lifespan. They further believe that human beings may refine their forms or personality but can never change them entirely. Darwin's Theory of Evolution steered naturalists such as George Williams and William Hamilton to the concept of personality evolution. They suggested that physical organs and also personality is a product of natural selection.\n\nWith the advent of genomic sequencing, it has become possible to search for and identify specific gene polymorphisms that affect traits such as IQ and personality. These techniques work by tracking the association of differences in a trait of interest with differences in specific molecular markers or functional variants. An example of a visible human trait for which the precise genetic basis of differences are relatively well known is eye color. For traits with many genes affecting the outcome, a smaller portion of the variance is currently understood: For instance for height known gene variants account for around 5–10% of height variance at present.\nWhen discussing the significant role of genetic heritability in relation to one's level of happiness, it has been found that from 44% to 52% of the variance in one's well-being is associated with genetic variation. Based on the retest of smaller samples of twins studies after 4,5, and 10 years, it is estimated that the heritability of the genetic stable component of subjective well-being approaches 80%. Other studies that have found that genes are a large influence in the variance found in happiness measures, exactly around 35–50%.\n\nIn contrast to views developed in 1960s that gender identity is primarily learned (which led to policy-based surgical sex changed in children such as David Reimer), genomics has provided solid evidence that both sex and gender identities are primarily influenced by genes:\n\nIn their attempts to locate the genes responsible for configuring certain phenotypes, researches resort to two different techniques.\nLinkage study facilitates the process of determining a specific location in which a gene of interest is located. This methodology is applied only among individuals that are related and does not serve to pinpoint specific genes. It does, however, narrow down the area of search, making it easier to locate one or several genes in the genome which constitute a specific trait.\n\nAssociation studies, on the other hand, are more hypothetic and seek to verify whether a particular genetic variable really influences the phenotype of interest. In association studies it is more common to use case-control approach, comparing the subject with relatively higher or lower hereditary determinants with the control subject.\n\n"}

Raden Mas Tumenggung Sukamto Notonagoro (10 December 1905 – 23 September 1981) was an Indonesian legal scholar and thinker. He is credited as being the first to approach the state philosophy of Pancasila philosophically.\n\nNotonagoro was born Sukamto in Sragen, Central Java, Indonesia on 10 December 1905. After marrying Gusti Raden Ayu Koostimah, daughter of Pakubuwono X, Susuhunan of Surakarta, as civil servant ('\"abdi dalem\"') of the '\"Kasunanan\"' kingdom, he was promoted to the rank of '\"Bupati Anom\"', given the royal title '\"Raden Mas Tumenggung\"' and given an 'adult' name of '\"Notonagoro\"'.\n\nNotonagoro graduated from the \"Rechtshogeschool\" in Jakarta in 1929, receiving the title \"Meester in de Rechten\". He later received a \"Doctorandus in de indologie\" from Leiden University, Netherlands, in 1932. After graduating, he found work in the Central Economics Office in Surakarta from 1932 to 1938. At roughly the same time, from 1933 to 1939, he taught at the Particuliere Algemene Middelbare School in Jakarta.\n\nA year after Indonesia's independence, Notonagoro was asked to join the Ministry of Prosperity; the following year, he began teaching at the Faculty of Agriculture in Klaten, Central Java. In 1949 he assisted in the founding of Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, later becoming a guest lecturer teaching agrarian law. By 1952 he had become dean of the faculty of law.\n\nNotonagoro became the founder of Gadjah Mada University's faculty of philosophy in 1968. For his work with the university and thoughts on Pancasila, Notonagoro was given an honorary doctorate in philosophy from Gadjah Mada University on 19 December 1973. He died on 23 September 1981.\n\nNotonagoro viewed the Indonesian people and culture as the \"causa materialis\" of Pancasila. He believed that Pancasila, no matter how phrased, kept the same basic meaning, namely as the state philosophy, and that it is not a political concept but a world view. As he considered Pancasila a central tenet of the Indonesian political system, Notonagoro considered it unchangeable, with the same meaning and same aspirations conveyed to each generation of Indonesians.\n\nHe saw three fundamental aspects of Pancasila: political, socio-cultural, and religious. In Notonagoro's system, the three aspects, as well as the five individual tenets of Pancasila, are a compound unit (). Notonagoro also saw Pancasila as existing in a pyramidal hierarchy, with each tenet being a refinement of the one before it; this hierarchy ensured that Pancasila should be taken as a whole, as Notonagoro viewed the abandonment of one or more tenets as destabilizing the whole system. For example, the first tenet (Belief in the one and only God), is implicitly the belief in the one and only God, complete with just and civilized humanity, the unity of Indonesia as well as democracy guided by the inner wisdom in the unanimity arising out of deliberations amongst representatives and full of social justice for all of the people of Indonesia. According to Notonagoro, the first two tenets, belief in the one and only God and just and civilized humanity, covered all aspects of humanity and served as the basis for the other three tenets.\n\nNotonagoro viewed the Indonesian government as a \"monodualist\" state, keeping both the cultural norms as well as national safety, peace, and order. He saw the priorities of government as follows, in descending order:\n\nAccording to Notonagoro, the government derives its powers from its citizens. He identified his views on the subject as being related to social democracy.\n\nAccording to Mustofa Anshori, assistant rector at Gadjah Mada University in 2006, Notonagoro helped establish the philosophical conceptualizations in the contextualization of Pancasila.\n\n"}
{"id": "13411927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13411927", "title": "Organizational ethics", "text": "Organizational ethics\n\nOrganizational ethics is the ethics of an organization, and it is how an organization responds to an internal or external stimulus. Organizational ethics is interdependent with the organizational culture. Although it is akin to both organizational behavior (OB) and industrial and organizational psychology as well as business ethics on the micro and macro levels, organizational ethics is neither OB or I/O psychology, nor is it solely business ethics (which includes corporate governance and corporate ethics). Organizational ethics express the values of an organization to its employees and/or other entities irrespective of governmental and/or regulatory laws.\n\nEthics are the principles and values used by an individual to govern his or her actions and decisions. An organization forms when individuals with varied interests and different backgrounds unite on a common platform and work together towards predefined goals and objectives. A code of ethics within an organization is a set of principles that is used to guide the organization in its decisions, programs, and policies. An ethical organizational culture consists of leaders and employees adhering to a code of ethics.\n\nAn organization's ethical philosophy can affect the organization in many ways including its reputation, productivity, and the bottom line of the organization. Ethics within an organization can offer many benefits. A positive ethical corporate culture improves the morale among the workers in an organization, which could increase productivity and employee retention. More productivity improves the efficiency of the organizations and increased employee retention reduces the cost of replacing employees. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) restricts the United States business firms from engaging in bribery and other illegal practices internationally. There are laws that have the same type of prohibition for European companies which create a disadvantage competitively for both European and U.S. firms. Such laws are not a restricting element to organizations that have highly elevated ethical behavior as part of their values. Organizations that lack ethical practices as a mandatory basis of their business structure and corporate culture, have commonly been found to fail due to the absence of business ethics. Corporate downfalls would include, but are not limited to, the recent Enron and WorldCom scandals, two primary examples of unethical business practices concerning questionable accounting transactions. \n\nOrganizations focusing on encouraging ethical practices are commonly viewed with respect by their employees, the community, and corresponding industries. Ethical business practices of organizations have resulted in a solid financial bottom-line. This has been seen through greater sales and increased revenue by companies retaining talented personnel and attracting new skilled employees. More importantly, an ethical organization will have the ability to retain employees that are experienced and knowledgeable (generally referred to as human capital). This human capital results in less employee turnover, less training time for new employees, and greater output regarding services (or production of goods).\n\nThere are at least four elements that aim to create an ethical culture and behavior of employees within an organization. These elements are: \n\nOrganizations are constantly striving for a better ethical atmosphere within the business climate and culture. Businesses must create an ethical business climate in order to develop an ethical organization. Otherwise said, companies must focus on the ethics of employees in order to create an ethical business. Employees must know the difference between what is acceptable and unacceptable in the workplace. These standards are found in the written code of ethics or may be referred to as the employee handbook. These standards are a written form of employee conduct and performance expectations.\n\nEmployee handbooks also commonly include rules concerning expectations and consequences that follow misconduct. Handbooks normally will clearly state the rules, guidelines, and standards of an organization as well as possible rules, regulations, and laws that they are bound by. Many company handbooks will include laws regarding sexual harassment, alcohol abuse, and drug/substance abuse.\n<br>For more information regarding situational ethical principles, refer to \"Situational Ethics.\"\n\nThe intrinsic and extrinsic rewards of an ethical organization are bound to an organization's culture and ethics. Based on the reliability and support structure of each of the four areas needed for ethical behavior, the organizational ethics will be evident throughout the organization. The organization including the employees, managers, suppliers, customers, and other entities, will receive intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Actions of employees can range from whistle blowing (intrinsic) to the extraordinary actions of hourly employee purchasing all the recently produced peanut butter (as produced by his employer), that has no resale value due to mislabeled jars. This employee was aware that his employer (extrinsic) would reimburse him in full for purchasing the mislabeled peanut butter.\n<br>For more information regarding intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, see \"Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation.\"\n\nThere are many theories and organizational studies that are related to “organizational ethics,” but \"organizations\" and \"ethics\" are wide and varied in application and scope. These theories and studies can range from individual(s), team(s), stakeholder, management, leadership, human resources, group(s) interaction(s), as well as the psychological framework behind each area to include the distribution of job tasks within various types of organizations. As among these areas, the influence of leadership in any organization cannot go unexamined, because of a clear understanding of the , goals (to include immediate and long-term strategic plans), and values. Leadership sets the tone for organizational management (strategic actions taken by an organization to create a positive image to both internal and external public). In turn, leadership directly influences the organizational symbolism (which reflects the culture, the language of the members, any meaningful objects, representations, and/or how someone may act or think within an organization). The values and ideals within an organization generally center upon “values for business” as the theoretical approach most leaders use to present to their \"co-members\" (which in truth maybe subordinates).\n<br>In fact, an examination of business reveals that most leaders approach the X(?) from the perspective of values for the business. Alongside presenting the vision, values, and goals of the organization, the leader should infuse empowerment and motivation to its members. Leaders using empowerment to motivate their subordinates, is based upon the view of: “Achieving organizational ownership of company values is a continuous process of communication, discussion, and debate throughout all areas of the organization” as.\n<br>For more information about organization theory, refer to \"Organizational Theory.\"\n\nWhether it is a team, small group, or a large international entity, the ability for any organization to reason, act rationally, and respond ethically is paramount. Leaders must have the ability to recognize the needs and desires of members (or called “stakeholders” in some theories or models), and how they correspond to the organization. It is the stakeholder theory that implies that all stakeholders (or individuals) must be treated equally, regardless of the fact that some individuals will contribute more than others to the organization.\n<br>Leaders who motivate others must present the goals of an organization to the stakeholders with respect to particular benefits of the stakeholders. Leaders must set aside individual (or personal) ambitions (along with any prejudice) in order to present these goals properly. Furthermore, it is leadership that influences stakeholders towards ethical behavior for the organization. They must step behind a veil of ignorance and treat every stakeholder as a means with equal weight. Importantly, the leader (or stakeholder management) must possess the necessary skills and rank to ensure that each stakeholders voice is respected and heard within the organization to ensure that other voices are not expressing views (or needs as in respects to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs). Therefore, stakeholder management must ensure an ethical system for their own management styles, personalities, systems, performances, plans, policies, strategies, productivity, openness, and even risk(s) within their cultures or industries.\n\nThe function of developing and implementing business ethics into an organization is difficult. Due to each organization's culture and atmosphere being different, there is no clear or specific way to implement a code of ethics to an existing business. Business ethics implementation can be categorized into two groups; formal and informal measures. Formal measures include training and courses pertaining to ethics. Informal measures are led by example from either the manager or the social norm of the company.\n\nThere are several steps to follow when trying to implement an ethical system. Some of these steps include obtaining a commitment from the board of directors and senior managers, developing resources for ethics initiatives, and determining ethical risks and developing contingency plans. Other steps include developing an ethics program that addresses risks while still maintaining compliance with the ethical standards, providing insight for implementation and audits of the ethical programs, and communicating with stakeholders to create shared commitment and values for ethical conduct.\n\nThe implementation should be performed to the entirety of the business including all areas of operations. If it is not implemented pragmatically and with caution for the needs, desires, and personalities (consider the Big Five personality traits) of the stakeholders, the culture, and the employees, then problems may arise. Although a great deal of time may be required, stakeholder management should consider the Rational Decision-Making Model for implementation of various aspects, details, and standards of an ethical system to the stakeholders. If an implementation has been performed successfully, then all stakeholders have accepted the newly designed ethics system for the organization.With the implementation of an ethical system comes the implementation of new tasks and responsibilities. The responsibilities include leadership in ethics, delegating, and communicating as well as motivating the company’s ethical position to its employees.\n\nRefer to the following theories and models for more information:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28889300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28889300", "title": "Processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure", "text": "Processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure\n\nThe processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure is a theory in psychological aesthetics on how people experience beauty. Processing fluency is the ease with which information is processed in the human mind.\n\nThe theory is based on four basic assumptions:\n\n\nThe processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure emphasizes the interaction between the viewer and an object in that it integrates theories and a wide range of empirical evidence that focus on effects of objective stimulus attributes on perceived beauty with those that emphasize the role of experience, for example by invoking prototypicality. In this theory, beauty is seen as an experience that has nothing to do with artistic merit: Beautiful works of art may be without any merit whereas good art is not necessarily beautiful.\n\nThe theory resolves the apparent paradox of inborn and acquired preferences. For instance, infants prefer consonant melodies. According to the fluency account, this is because infants share perceptual equipment that make them process consonance in music more easily than dissonance. When children grow up, they are exposed to the music of their culture, resulting in culture-specific musical fluency. This familiarization explains why individuals from different cultures have different musical tastes. In addition, the theory helps explain why beauty (in a wide sense; perhaps the term \"elegance\" is more apt) is a cue for truth in mathematical problem solving and scientific discovery.\n\nThe theory and its implications have influenced theory and research in the psychology of perception, cognitive psychology, social psychology, empirical aesthetics, web design, marketing, finance, and archeology.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20025013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20025013", "title": "Reverence for Life", "text": "Reverence for Life\n\nThe phrase Reverence for Life is a translation of the German phrase: \"\". These words came to Albert Schweitzer on a boat trip on the Ogooué River in French Equatorial Africa (now Gabon), while searching for a universal concept of ethics for our time.\n\nSchweitzer made the phrase the basic tenet of an ethical philosophy, which he developed and put into practice. He gave expression to its development in numerous books and publications during his life and also in manuscripts which have recently been published; the main work being his unfinished four-part \"Philosophy of culture\" () subtitled: \"The World-view of Reverence for Life\". He also used his hospital in Lambaréné in Gabon (Central Africa) to demonstrate this philosophy in practice.\n\nHe believed that Reverence for Life is a concept that develops from observation of the world around us. In 'Civilization and Ethics' he expressed this in these words:\n\nJames Brabazon (Author of the Biography of Albert Schweitzer) defined Reverence for Life with the following statement:\n\nAlbert Schweitzer hoped that the ethic of Reverence for Life would make its way in the world on the basis of his explanation of it in his books and talks, the example of his life and the force of its own argument based on the depth of fundamental thought. To some extent this is taking place as is evidenced by the growth of the environmental movement. (The book \"Silent Spring\", by Rachael Carson, which is widely credited with helping launch the environmental movement, was dedicated to Albert Schweitzer).\n\nAlbert Schweitzer believed that ethical values which could underpin the ideal of true civilization had to have their foundation in deep thought and be world- and life-affirming. He therefore embarked on a search for ethical values in the various major religions and world-views accessible to him, but could not find any that were able, unequivocally, to combine ethics with life-affirmation. It was not until two years after moving out to Gabon to establish the Albert Schweitzer Hospital that he finally found the simple statement which answered his quest.\n\nIn his autobiography \"Out of My Life and Thought,\" Schweitzer explains this process.\n\n\"Having described how at the beginning of the summer of 1915 he awoke from some kind of mental daze, asking himself why he was only criticizing civilization and not working on something constructive.\". He relates how he asked himself the question:\n\nBut what is civilization?\n\nThe essential element in civilization is the ethical perfecting of the individual as well as society. At the same time, every spiritual and every material step forward has significance for civilization. The will to civilization is, then, the universal will to progress that is conscious of the ethical as the highest value. In spite of the great importance we attach to the achievements of science and human prowess, it is obvious that only a humanity that is striving for ethical ends can benefit in full measure from material progress and can overcome the dangers that accompany it...\n\nThe only possible way out of chaos is for us to adopt a concept of the world based on the ideal of true civilization.\n\nBut what is the nature of that concept of the world in which the will to the general progress and the will to the ethical progress join and are linked?\n\nIt consists in an ethical affirmation of the world and of life.\n\nWhat is affirmation of the world and of life?...\n\nFor months on end, I lived in a continual state of mental agitation. Without the least success I concentrated - even during my daily work at the hospital - on the real nature of the affirmation of life and of ethics, and on the question of what they have in common. I was wandering about in a thicket where no path was to be found. I was pushing against an iron door that would not yield...\n\nIn that mental state, I had to take a long journey up the river . . . Lost in thought, I sat on deck of the barge, struggling to find the elementary and universal concept of the ethical that I had not discovered in any philosophy. I covered sheet after sheet with disconnected sentences merely to concentrate on the problem. Two days passed. Late on the third day, at the very moment when, at sunset, we were making our way through a herd of hippopotamuses, there flashed upon my mind, unforeseen and unsought, the phrase : “Reverence for Life”. [lang|de| Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben] The iron door had yielded. The path in the thicket had become visible. Now I had found my way to the principle in which affirmation of the world and ethics are joined together!” \n\n-- Albert Schweitzer\n\nAccording to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development for reverence for life, was influenced by Indian religious thought and in particular Jain principle of ahimsa (non-violence). Albert Schweitzer has noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book \"Indian Thought and Its Development\":\nThe laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its principle, founded on world and life denial, of abstention from action, ancient Indian thought - and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far - reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds. So far as we know, this is for the first time clearly expressed by Jainism.\n\nIt should not be overlooked, however, that as a child he felt deeply for the suffering of all the creatures around him. It beat upon him. He wrote, \"As far back as I can remember I was saddened by the amount of misery I saw in the world around me. Youth's unqualified joie de vivre I never really knew...One thing especially saddened me was that the unfortunate animals had to suffer so much pain and misery...It was quite incomprehensible to me -- this was before I began going to school -- why in my evening prayers I should pray for human beings only. So when my mother had prayed with me and had kissed me good-night, I used to add silently a prayer that I composed myself for all living creatures. It ran thus: \"O heavenly Father, protect and bless all things that have breath guard them from all evil, and let them sleep in peace...\" \n\nSchweitzer twice went fishing with some boys \"because they asked [him] to\" and \"this sports was soon made impossible for me by the treatment of the worms that were put on the hook...and the wrenching of the mouths of the fishes that were caught. I gave it up...From experiences like these, which moved my heart...there slowly grew up in me an unshakeable conviction that we have no right to inflict suffering and death on another living creature, and that we ought all of us to feel what a horrible thing it is to cause suffering and death...\" The concept of Reverence for Life was incipient in Schweizer almost from birth.\n\nThis awareness affected him throughout his life, as when he would carefully, gently scoop a spider out of a hole it had fallen into before planting a crop there, to feed his patients and their families who also worked on the hospital farm. He wrote that, just as our own existence is significance to each of us, \"[a creature's] existence is significant to it.\" He wrote that \"...my relation to my own being and to the objective world is determined by reverence for life. This reverence for life is given as an element of my will-to-live...\" and this will-to-live existed in all creatures and was to be respected.\n\nAs a child he was taught, and later as an adult taught his congregations, the \"fundamental truths of the religion of Jesus as something not hostile to reason, but, on the contrary, as strengthening them.\" Many later thanked him, saying that this teaching had \"helped them to keep their religion in later life.\" A great mind, he went through \"heaps of books\" which were piled so high he had to make aisles to get through them. He studied the life of Jesus in a depth few have ever achieved. His own philosophy, which came to be encapsulated in the phrase Reverence for Life, had this bedrock in the Four Gospels of the New Testament.\n\nIn his book \"The Philosophy of Civilization\", Schweitzer wrote, \"Ethics are responsibility without limit toward all that lives...Love means more, since it includes fellowship in suffering, in joy, and in effort...\n\nThe word ‘will’ in the sense of determination or firmness of purpose is rarely used today and therefore Schweitzer’s use of the word as translated from the German word ‘Wille’ may appear unfamiliar. However, it is a significant part of Schweitzer’s message. He held the view in the 1920s that people had largely lost touch with their own will, having subjugated it to outside authority and sacrificed it to external circumstances.\n\nHe therefore pointed back to that elemental part of ourselves that can be in touch with our ‘will’ and can exercise it for the good of all.\n\nIn \"Out of My Life and Thought\" Schweitzer wrote:\n\nIn his search for an answer to the problems posed by what was to him the obvious decline of western civilization, Albert Schweitzer was not prepared to give up the belief in progress which is so much taken for granted by people of European descent. Rather, he sought to identify why this ‘will to progress’ was seemingly going off the rails and causing the disintegration of European civilization.\n\nHe came to the following conclusion: (\"Out of my Life and Thought\")\n\n\n"}

{"id": "373076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=373076", "title": "Sannyasa", "text": "Sannyasa\n\nSannyasa () is the life stage of renunciation within the Hindu philosophy of four age-based life stages known as ashramas, with the first three being Brahmacharya (bachelor student), Grihastha (householder) and Vanaprastha (forest dweller, retired). Sannyasa is traditionally conceptualized for men or women in late years of their life, but young brahmacharis have had the choice to skip the householder and retirement stages, renounce worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicate their lives to spiritual pursuits.\n\nSannyasa is a form of asceticism, is marked by renunciation of material desires and prejudices, represented by a state of disinterest and detachment from material life, and has the purpose of spending one's life in peaceful, love-inspired, simple spiritual life. An individual in Sanyasa is known as a Sannyasi (male) or Sannyasini (female) in Hinduism, which in many ways parallel to the Sadhu and Sadhvi traditions of Jain monasticism, the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis of Buddhism and the monk and nun traditions of Christianity, respectively.\n\nSannyasa has historically been a stage of renunciation, ahimsa (non-violence) peaceful and simple life and spiritual pursuit in Indian traditions. However, this has not always been the case. After the invasions and establishment of Muslim rule in India, from the 12th century through the British Raj, parts of the Shaiva and Vaishnava ascetics metamorphosed into a military order, to rebel against persecution, where they developed martial arts, created military strategies, and engaged in guerrilla warfare. These warrior \"sanyasis\" (ascetics) played an important role in helping European colonial powers establish themselves in India.\n\n' in Sanskrit nyasa means purification, sannyasa means \"Purification of Everything\". It is a composite word of which means \"together, all\", \"ni-\" which means \"down\" and ' from the root \"\", meaning \"to throw\" or \"to put\". A literal translation of Sannyāsa is thus \"to put down everything, all of it\". Sannyasa is sometimes spelled as \"Sanyasa\".\n\nThe term \"Saṃnyasa\" makes appearance in the Samhitas, Aranyakas and Brahmanas, the earliest layers of Vedic literature (2nd millennium BCE), but it is rare. It is not found in ancient Buddhist or Jaina vocabularies, and only appears in Brahmanical literature of the 1st millennium BCE, in the context of those who have given up ritual activity and taken up non-ritualistic spiritual pursuits discussed in the Upanishads. The term \"Sannyasa\" evolves into a rite of renunciation in ancient Sutra texts, and thereafter became a recognized, well discussed stage of life (Ashrama) by about the 3rd and 4th century CE.\n\nIn Dravidian languages, \"sannyasi\" is pronounced as \"sanyasi\" and also \"sannasi\" in colloquial form. Sanyasis are also known as Bhiksu, Pravrajita/Pravrajitā, Yati, Sramana and Parivrajaka in Hindu texts.\n\nJamison and Witzel state early Vedic texts make no mention of \"Sannyasa\", or \"Ashrama system\", unlike the concepts of Brahmacharin and Grihastha which they do mention. Instead, Rig Veda uses the term \"Antigriha\" (अन्तिगृह) in hymn 10.95.4, still part of extended family, where older people lived in ancient India, with an outwardly role. It is in later Vedic era and over time, \"Sannyasa\" and other new concepts emerged, while older ideas evolved and expanded. A three-stage Ashrama concept along with Vanaprastha emerged about or after 7th Century BC, when sages such as Yājñavalkya left their homes and roamed around as spiritual recluses and pursued their \"Pravrajika\" (wanderer) lifestyle. The explicit use of the four stage Ashrama concept, appeared a few centuries later.\n\nHowever, early Vedic literature from 2nd millennium BC, mentions \"Muni\" (मुनि, monks, mendicants, holy man), with characteristics that mirror those found in later \"Sannyasins\" and \"Sannyasinis\". Rig Veda, for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions munis as those with \"Kesin\" (केशिन्, long haired) and \"Mala\" clothes (मल, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of \"Mananat\" (mind, meditation). Rigveda, however, refers to these people as \"Muni\" and \"Vati\" (वति, monks who beg).\n\nThese \"Munis\", their lifestyle and spiritual pursuit, likely influenced the Sannyasa concept, as well as the ideas behind the ancient concept of Brahmacharya (bachelor student). One class of \"Munis\" were associated with Rudra. Another were \"Vratyas\".\n\nHinduism has no formal demands nor requirements on the lifestyle or spiritual discipline, method or deity a Sanyasin or Sanyasini must pursue – it is left to the choice and preferences of the individual. This freedom has led to diversity and significant differences in the lifestyle and goals of those who adopt Sannyasa. There are, however, some common themes. A person in \"Sannyasa\" lives a simple life, typically detached, itinerant, drifting from place to place, with no material possessions or emotional attachments. They may have a walking stick, a book, a container or vessel for food and drink, often wearing yellow, saffron, orange, ochre or soil colored clothes. They may have long hair and appear disheveled, and are usually vegetarians. Some minor Upanishads as well as monastic orders consider women, children, students, fallen men (those with a criminal record) and others as not qualified to become \"Sannyasa\"; while other texts place no restrictions. The dress, the equipage and lifestyle varies between groups. For example, Sannyasa Upanishad in verses 2.23 to 2.29, identifies six lifestyles for six types of renunciates. One of them is described as living with the following possessions,\n\nThose who enter Sannyasa may choose whether they join a group (mendicant order). Some are anchorites, homeless mendicants preferring solitude and seclusion in remote parts, without affiliation. Others are cenobites, living and traveling with kindred fellow-Sannyasi in the pursuit of their spiritual journey, sometimes in Ashramas or Matha/Sangha (hermitages, monastic order).\n\nMost Hindu ascetics adopt celibacy when they begin Sannyasa. However, there are exceptions, such as the Saiva Tantra school of asceticism where ritual sex is considered part of liberation process. Sex is viewed by them as a transcendence from a personal, intimate act to something impersonal and ascetic.\n\nThe goal of the Hindu Sannyasin is moksha (liberation). The idea of what that means varies from tradition to tradition.\n\nFor the Bhakti (devotion) traditions, liberation consists of union with the Divine and release from Saṃsāra (rebirth in future life); for Yoga traditions, liberation is the experience of the highest Samādhi (deep awareness in this life); and for the Advaita tradition, liberation is jivanmukti – the awareness of the Supreme Reality (Brahman) and Self-realization in this life. Sannyasa is a means and an end in itself. It is a means to decreasing and then ultimately ending all ties of any kind. It is a means to the soul and meaning, but not ego nor personalities. Sannyasa does not abandon the society, it abandons the ritual mores of the social world and one's attachment to all its other manifestations. The end is a liberated, content, free and blissful existence.\n\nThe behavioral state of a person in \"Sannyasa\" is described by many ancient and medieval era Indian texts. Bhagavad Gita discusses it in many verses, for example:\n\nOther behavioral characteristics, in addition to renunciation, during Sannyasa include: ahimsa (non-violence), akrodha (not become angry even if you are abused by others), disarmament (no weapons), chastity, bachelorhood (no marriage), avyati (non-desirous), amati (poverty), self-restraint, truthfulness, sarvabhutahita (kindness to all creatures), asteya (non-stealing), aparigraha (non-acceptance of gifts, non-possessiveness) and shaucha (purity of body speech and mind). Some Hindu monastic orders require the above behavior in form of a vow, before a renunciate can enter the order. Tiwari notes that these virtues are not unique to \"Sannyasa\", and other than renunciation, all of these virtues are revered in ancient texts for all four \"Ashramas\" (stages) of human life.\n\nBaudhayana Dharmasūtra, completed by about 7th century BC, states the following behavioral vows for a person in \"Sannyasa\"\n\nAshrama Upanishad identified various types of Sannyasi renouncers based on their different goals: Kutichaka – seeking atmospheric world; Bahudaka – seeking heavenly world; Hamsa – seeking penance world; Paramahamsa – seeking truth world; and Turiyatitas and Avadhutas seeking liberation in this life.\n\nIn some texts, such as Sannyasa Upanishad, these were classified by the symbolic items the Sannyasins carried and their lifestyle. For example, Kutichaka sannyasis carried triple staffs, Hamsa sannyasis carried single staffs, while Paramahamsas went without them. This method of classification based on emblematic items became controversial, as anti-thematic to the idea of renunciation. Later texts, such as Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad stated that all renunciation is one, but people enter the state of Sannyasa for different reasons – for detachment and getting away from their routine meaningless world, to seek knowledge and meaning in life, to honor rites of Sannyasa they have undertaken, and because he already has liberating knowledge.\n\nThere were many groups of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist Sannyasis co-existing in pre-Maurya Empire era, each classified by their attributes, such as: Achelakas (without clothes), Ajivika, Aviruddhaka, Devadhammika, Eka-satakas, Gotamaka, Jatilaka, Magandika, Mundasavaka, Nigrantha (Jains), Paribbajaka, Tedandikas, Titthiya and others.\n\nThe Dharmasūtras and Dharmaśāstras, composed about mid 1st millennium BC and later, place increasing emphasis on all four stages of \"Ashrama system\" including \"Sannyasa\". The Baudhayana Dharmasūtra, in verses 2.11.9 to 2.11.12, describes the four Ashramas as \"a fourfold division of Dharma\". The older Dharmasūtras, however, are significantly different in their treatment of \"Ashramas\" system from the more modern Dharmaśāstras, because they do not limit some of their Ashrama rituals to \"dvija\" men, that is, the three \"varnas\" – Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. The newer Dharmaśāstra vary widely in their discussion of \"Ashrama\" system in the context of classes (castes), with some mentioning it for three, while others such as \"Vaikhānasa Dharmasūtra\" including all four.\n\nThe Dharmasūtras and Dharmaśāstras give a number of detailed but widely divergent guidelines on renunciation. In all cases, Sannyasa was never mandatory and was one of the choices before an individual. Only a small percentage chose this path. Olivelle posits that the older Dharmasūtras present the \"Ashramas\" including \"Sannyasa\" as four alternative ways of life and options available, but not as sequential stage that any individual must follow. Olivelle also states that \"Sannyasa\" along with the Ashrama system gained mainstream scholarly acceptance about 2nd century BC.\n\nAncient and medieval era texts of Hinduism consider \"Grihastha\" (householder) stage as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as human beings in this stage not only pursue a virtuous life, they produce food and wealth that sustains people in other stages of life, as well as the offsprings that continues mankind. However, an individual had the choice to renounce any time he or she wanted, including straight after student life.\n\nBaudhayana Dharmasūtra, in verse II.10.17.2 states that anyone who has finished Brahmacharya (student) life stage may become ascetic immediately, in II.10.17.3 that any childless couple may enter Sannyasa anytime they wish, while verse II.10.17.4 states that a widower may choose Sannyasa if desired, but in general, states verse II.10.17.5, Sannyasa is suited after the completion of age 70 and after one's children have been firmly settled. Other texts suggest the age of 75.\n\nThe ' and \"Āpastamba Dharmasūtra\"s, and the later ' describe the \"āśrama\"s as sequential stages which would allow one to pass from Vedic studentship to householder to forest-dwelling hermit to renouncer. However, these texts differ with each other. Yājñavalkya Smṛti, for example, differs from Manusmṛti and states in verse 3.56 that one may skip Vanaprastha (forest dwelling, retired) stage and go straight from the \"Grihastha\" (householder) stage to \"Sannyasa\".\n\nThe question as to which \"\" may, or may not, renounce is never explicitly stated in ancient or medieval dharma literature, the more modern Dharmaśāstras texts discuss much of renunciation stage in context of \"dvija\" men. Nevertheless, Dharmaśāstra texts document people of all castes as well as women, entered \"Sannyasa\" in practice.\n\nAfter renouncing the world, the ascetic's financial obligations and property rights were dealt by the state, just like a dead person. Viṣṇu Smriti in verse 6.27, for example, states that if a debtor takes \"Sannyasa\", his sons or grandsons should settle his debts. As to the little property a Sannyasin may collect or possess after renunciation, Book III Chapter XVI of Kautiliya's Arthashastra states that the property of hermits (vánaprastha), ascetics (yati, sannyasa), and student bachelors (Brahmachári) shall on their death be taken by their \"guru\", disciples, their \"dharmabhratri\" (brother in the monastic order), or classmates in succession.\n\nAlthough a renouncer's practitioner's obligations and property rights were reassigned, he or she continued to enjoy basic human rights such as the protection from injury by others and the freedom to travel. Likewise, someone practicing Sannyasa was subject to the same laws as common citizens; stealing, harming, or killing a human being by a Sannyasi were all serious crimes in Kautiliya's Arthashastra.\n\nLater Indian literature debates whether the benefit of renunciation can be achieved (\"moksha,\" or liberation) without asceticism in the earlier stages of one's life. For example, Bhagavad Gita, Vidyaranya's \"Jivanmukti Viveka,\" and others believed that various alternate forms of yoga and the importance of yogic discipline could serve as paths to spirituality, and ultimately \"moksha\". Over time, four paths to liberating spirituality have emerged in Hinduism: Jñāna yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Rāja yoga. Acting without greed or craving for results, in Karma yoga for example, is considered a form of detachment in daily life similar to \"Sannyasa\". Sharma states that, \"the basic principle of Karma yoga is that it is not what one does, but how one does it that counts and if one has the know-how in this sense, one can become liberated by doing whatever it is one does\", and \"(one must do) whatever one does without attachment to the results, with efficiency and to the best of one's ability\".\n\nAscetic life was historically a life of renunciation, non-violence and spiritual pursuit. However, in India, this has not always been the case. For example, after the Mongol and Persian Islamic invasions in the 12th century, and the establishment of Delhi Sultanate, the ensuing Hindu-Muslim conflicts provoked the creation of a military order of Hindu ascetics in India. These warrior Ascetics, formed paramilitary groups called ‘‘Akharas’’ and they invented a range of martial arts.\n\n\"Nath Siddhas\" of the 12th century AD, may have been the earliest Hindu monks to resort to a military response after the Muslim conquest. Ascetics, by tradition, led a nomadic and unattached lifestyle. As these ascetics dedicated themselves to rebellion, their groups sought stallions, developed techniques for spying and targeting, and they adopted strategies of war against Muslim nobles and the Sultanate state. Many of these groups were devotees of Hindu deity Mahadeva, and were called \"Mahants\". Other popular names for them was \"Sannyasis\", \"Yogis\", \"Nagas\" (followers of Shiva), \"Bairagis\" (followers of Vishnu) and \"Gosains\" from 1500 to 1800 AD; in some cases, these Hindu monks cooperated with Muslim fakirs who were Sufi and also persecuted.\n\nWarrior monks continued their rebellion through the Mughal Empire, and became a political force during the early years of British Raj. In some cases, these regiments of soldier monks shifted from guerrilla campaigns to war alliances, and these Hindu warrior monks played a key role in helping British establish themselves in India. The significance of warrior ascetics rapidly declined with the consolidation of British Raj in late 19th century, and with the rise in non-violence movement by Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nNovetzke states that some of these Hindu Warrior Ascetics were treated as folk heroes, aided by villagers and townspeople, because they targeted figures of political and economic power in a discriminatory state, and some of these warriors paralleled Robin Hood's lifestyle.\n\nOf the 108 Upanishads of the Muktika, the largest corpus is dedicated to \"Sannyasa\" and to Yoga, or about 20 each, with some overlap. The renunciation-related texts are called the Sannyasa Upanishads. These are as follows:\n\nAmong the thirteen major or Principal Upanishads, all from the ancient era, many include sections related to \"Sannyasa\". For example, the motivations and state of a \"Sannyasi\" are mentioned in Maitrāyaṇi Upanishad, a classical major Upanishad that Robert Hume included among his list of \"Thirteen Principal Upanishads\" of Hinduism. Maitrāyaṇi starts with the question, \"given the nature of life, how is joy possible?\" and \"how can one achieve moksha (liberation)?\"; in later sections it offers a debate on possible answers and its views on Sannyasa.\n\nSix of the Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century, the Naradaparivrajaka and Satyayaniya Upanishads to around the 12th-century, and about ten of the remaining Sannyasa Upanishads are dated to have been composed in the 14th- to 15th-century CE well after the start of Islamic Sultanates period of South Asia in late 12th-century.\n\nThe oldest Sannyasa Upanishads have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook, and these pre-date Adi Shankara. Most of the Sannyasa Upanishads present a Yoga and nondualism (Advaita) Vedanta philosophy. This may be, states Patrick Olivelle, because major Hindu monasteries of early medieval period (1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition. The 12th-century Shatyayaniya Upanishad is a significant exception, which presents qualified dualistic and Vaishnavism (Vishishtadvaita Vedanta) philosophy.\n\nCited books:\n\n"}

His father, Lev I. Soloveychik, was editor, writer and administrator at the \"Krasnaya Zvezda\" (\"Red Star\") newspaper, and later managed the Moscow-based Voienizdat publishing house. After graduating from the Philology Department of Moscow State University in 1953 Simon worked as a boys and girls scouts leader, a secondary school teacher, and a correspondent of \"Pioneer\" magazine.\nIn 1960 he worked for the newspaper \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\", where he launched a wide theme named \"Aly parus\" (Scarlet Sail), where he published articles on humanism and morality.\n\nIn mid-1980 he initiated a new scientific-practical pedagogical movement - pedagogy of cooperation. From that perspective upbringing of a child was considered not as an influence upon a child but as a dialog between educator and a student. He also regularly published pedagogical articles in the \"Novoe vremya\" (\"New Time\") magazine.\n\nIn 1992 Soloveychik founded and lead the newspaper \"Pervoe sentyabrya\" (\"First of September\"), which promoted humanistic pedagogical ideas.\n\nIn 1994 Simon Soloveychik wrote the manifest \"Chelovek Svobodny\" (\"Free Man\"), in which he briefly and clearly wrote the basic philosophical ideas of upbringing of a free man, and he gave definitions of such concepts as internal freedom and conscience, explained what a free child is, what a free school is, and what the way to raising free men is.\n\nThe main work of his life is his book \"Pedagogika dlya vseh\" (Parenting For Everyone) (1977-1986), where he shared his philosophical insights on the goals, means and conditions of parenting free children; he explained how to raise the heart, intelligence and spirit of a free man, and underlined the faults of conventional approaches to parenting.\nAccording to Soloveychik, parenting is the science about the art of upbringing children. The main idea in upbringing is that parents by all means should increase a child's dignity.\n\"Soloveychik was a classic member of the Russian intelligentsia, focused on underlying ideas and their significance, rather than on what was practical or expedient. He wrote always in defense of teachers and their work... Perhaps the organizing idea of Soloveychik's work was expressed in a remark he … made to a visiting American educator who wanted Soloveychik's reaction to some new psychological theory. \"You know,\" said Simon L'vovich, \"everyone thinks that the essence of pedagogy is in psychology, but it's not. The essence of pedagogy is in ethics.\" It would be a fitting epitaph for this courageous writer and intellectual.\" — \" from obituary by Stephen Kerr 10/18/96\n"}

He is Emeritus Professor of History of Philosophy and History of Science at the University of Sydney. \n\nStephen Gaukroger was born in Oldham, Lancashire, and educated at Cardinal Langley Grammar School. He studied Philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London, where he was awarded first class honours with the official congratulations of the Board of Examiners. He was a graduate student at Darwin College, Cambridge, completing his PhD in 1977 in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science.\n\nIn 1977 he was elected to a research fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and at the end of 1978 moved to a research fellowship at the University of Melbourne. In 1981 he took up a lectureship in philosophy at the University of Sydney. He married Helen Irving in 1980 and they have two children, Cressida (born 1986), and Hugh (born 1989). He divides his time between Sydney and London.\n\nGaukroger’s first publication was on Gaston Bachelard, and in the 1970s and early 1980s he wrote a number papers on classical philosophy and science, as well as on Marx, Euler, and Vico. But between the late 1970s and late 1990s he focused primarily on early modern philosophy, with books on Descartes and Bacon, including an intellectual biography of Descartes which placed his metaphysics and epistemology in the context of his natural philosophy. From the late 1990s onwards he has been concerned with a large-scale project on the emergence of a scientific culture, i.e. one in which all cognitive values come to be centred around scientific ones. Three volumes devoted to this question have appeared — \"The Emergence of a Scientific Culture: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1210-1685\" (2006), \"The Collapse of Mechanism and the Rise of Sensibility: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1680-1760\" (2010), and \"The Natural and the Human: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1739-1841\" (2016).

In it, Nagel argues that materialist theories of mind omit the essential component of consciousness, namely that there is something that it is (or feels) like to be a particular, conscious thing. He argues that an organism has conscious mental states, \"if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like \"for\" the organism to be itself.\" Daniel Dennett, a critic of Nagel's argument, nevertheless called this paper \"the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness.\"\n\nThe thesis attempts to refute reductionism (the philosophical position that a complex system is nothing more than the sum of its parts). For example, a physicalist reductionist's approach to the mind–body problem holds that the mental process humans experience as consciousness can be fully described via physical processes in the brain and body.\n\nNagel begins by arguing that the conscious experience is widespread, present in many animals (particularly mammals), and that for an organism to have a conscious experience it must be special, in the sense that its qualia or \"subjective character of experience\" are unique. Nagel stated, “An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism – something that it is like for the organism to be itself.”\n\nThe paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain consciousness via objective, reductionist means. A subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be explained without the subjective character of experience, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a reductionist being; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to materialism. Thus for consciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of experience would have to be discarded, which is absurd. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such a world each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property attributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel argues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a “single point of view,” making it unfeasible to consider any conscious experience as “objective”.\n\nNagel uses the metaphor of bats to clarify the distinction between subjective and objective concepts. Bats are mammals, so they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both sonar and vision are regarded as perceptional experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and eat insects like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset.\n\nSuch is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, “our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience”, meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them (Subjectivism). Objectivity, requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience.\n\nNagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the mind-body problem.\n\nDennett denies Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any \"interesting or theoretically important\" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation. For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. He holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments.\n\n\n"}

Goetzmann (July 20, 1930 – September 7, 2010) was an American historian and emeritus professor in the American Studies and American Civilization Programs at the University of Texas at Austin. He attended Yale University as a graduate student and was friends with Tom Wolfe while there. His work on the American West won him the highest prizes for historians, the Parkman Prize and the Pulitzer Prize. He has written and published extensively on American philosophy, American political history, and the American arts. An advocate for the importance of history as a public discussion, he has served in various capacities in television and film production, notably for PBS. He was most recently the Jack S. Blanton, Sr., Chair Emeritus in History and American Studies. His last book published during his lifetime was \"Beyond the Revolution: A History of American Thought From Paine to Pragmatism\" (2009).\n\nWilliam H. Goetzmann was born in Washington and raised in the American Midwest, notably in St. Paul, Minnesota, where his family once rented an apartment previously occupied by the bank robber John Dillinger. The Dillinger-apartment experience was one of many that drew him to the study of history as a dramatic narrative populated by colorful individuals and sweeping movements. Educated at Yale University where he received BA and Ph.D. degrees, he taught at Yale from 1955 to 1964, with his interest in the history of the West sparked by the historian Howard R. Lamar. He then moved to The University of Texas at Austin to develop its fledgling American Studies and American Civilization Programs. His early writing concerned American diplomacy and American expansionism; in 1966, Alfred A. Knopf published his \"Exploration and Empire: The Explorer and the Scientist in the Winning of the American West\", which rapidly won the two most prestigious prizes in American historical writing, the Parkman Prize and the Pulitzer Prize. Over the next 5 decades, he published widely, establishing himself as one of the nation's premiere historians, and ranging widely among intellectual history, cultural history, art history, history of science, and history of philosophy. A devoted and influential teacher, he was mentor to MacArthur \"Genius Award\" winner Stephen J. Pyne, design historian Jeffrey Meikle, historian of photography and cultural historian Peter Bacon Hales, novelist and cultural historian Kay Sloan, and many others.\n\nGoetzmann died of congestive heart failure in Austin, Texas. He was survived by his wife, Mewes Goetzmann, sons William N., of New Haven, and Stephen R. Goetzmann of Dallas; a daughter, Anne Goetzmann Kelley of Austin; and five grandchildren.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a Dharma heir of Sojun Mel Weitsman, from whom he received Dharma transmission in 1988. Fischer served as co-abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center from 1995–2000, after which he founded the Everyday Zen Foundation in 2000, a network of Buddhist practice group and related projects in Canada, the United States and Mexico. Fischer has published more than twenty-five books of poetry and non-fiction, as well as numerous poems, essays and articles in Buddhist magazines and poetry journals.\n\nNorman Fischer was born to a Jewish family in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 1946, and was raised in Pittston, Pennsylvania. As a child he attended services with his parents at a Conservative synagogue. He received a B.A. from Colgate University, where he studied religion, philosophy, and literature, an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa, and an M.A. in history and phenomenology of religion at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Graduate Theological Union.\n\nFrom 1970 through 1976, Fischer trained at the Berkeley Zen Center, a temple in the lineage of Shunryu Suzuki, under the guidance of Sojun Mel Weitsman. In 1976, he and his wife moved to Tassajara, a training monastery near Big Sur, where they lived as residential monastics for five years. In 1980, they were both ordained as Zen priests by Zentatsu Richard Baker, from whom Fischer received the dharma name Zoketsu Rinsho. In 1981, they moved to Green Gulch Farm Zen Center in Marin County, California, where Fischer served in various monastic positions including Director, Tanto (Head of Practice), and Co-Abbot from 1981 to 2000. During that time, in 1988, he received Dharma transmission from his longtime teacher, Sojun Mel Weitsman.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, Fischer served as co-abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC), first with Sojun Mel Weitsman, and then with Zenkei Blanche Hartman. During his abbacy, Fischer supported the research, drafting and formal institution of a women’s lineage chant, alongside the traditional men’s lineage chant, during services. Later, with poet and translator Peter Levitt, he supported the drafting of an official women’s lineage paper—the first female lineage document in the history of any major world religion—which traces the line of female practitioners from the Buddha’s time to the present and recognizes the important historical role of the Zen women ancestors.\n\nAs a senior Dharma teacher, Fischer continues to participate at the San Francisco Zen Center and its affiliate temples, giving talks and leading practice events. In 2000, he founded the Everyday Zen Foundation, which has practice groups in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\n\nFischer has also integrated Buddhist contemplative practices in business, law, and education—specifically for hospice workers, software engineers, and conflict resolution specialists. In 1987, Fischer founded (among others) the Zen Hospice Project at the San Francisco Zen Center, for which he served as board chair for over 20 years, and is now emeritus chair. He is also a faculty member of the Metta Institute, a training institute for hospice caregivers.\n\nIn 2007, he developed (along with Chade-Meng Tan, Mirabai Bush, Daniel Golemen and Jon Kabat-Zinn) the course on mindfulness and emotional intelligence, “Search Inside Yourself”, which was originally taught at Google’s program for employees, and has now been taught to over 20,000 people in more than 100 cities. Fischer is currently involved with conflict resolution work at Gary Friedman and Jack Himmelstein’s Center for Understanding in Conflict, where he trains conflict resolution professionals.\n\nHe has also consulted with U.S. Army chaplains about incorporating Zen practices into their work. He has taught and lectured at Harvard, Yale, Brown and Stanford universities and in 2014, he gave the baccalaureate address at Stanford University.  He has also served as mentor to teenage boys; this experience is chronicled in his book \"Taking Our Places: The Buddhist Path to Truly Growing Up\" (HarperOne, 2003).\n\nFischer also teaches Zen workshops and retreats on the importance of compassion practice, as modeled in his book, \"Training in Compassion: Zen Teachings on the Practice of Lojong\" (Shambhala, 2013). This was the subject of a Spring 2016 online course taught by Fischer, and offered through Tricycle Magazine, in collaboration with San Francisco Zen Center.\n\nFischer is a proponent of interreligious dialogue between the worlds' religions, stating:  \"I feel that in our period it is the challenge of religious traditions to do something more than simply reassert and reinterpret their faiths, hoping for loyal adherents to what they perceive to be the true doctrine. Looking back at the last century, with its devastating wars and holocausts and the shock of ecological vulnerability, I have the sense that religious traditions must now have a wider mission, and it is in the recognition of this mission, I believe, that interreligious dialogue becomes something not only polite and interesting, but also essential.\" He currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute, an interreligious dialogue organization. In July 1996, he attended a five-day meeting between members of different religions held at The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky, where he gave a talk about Dogen, zazen, and the importance of religions coming together—despite their different philosophies—to serve humanity. Fischer has participated in interreligious pilgrimages with Father Laurence Freeman OSB and the Dalai Lama.\nFischer has been active in the Jewish meditation movement since the 1990s, working at first with Rabbi Alan Lew, and now with rabbis and Jewish meditation teachers from around the world. In January 2000, he and Rabbi Lew founded Makor Or, a Jewish Meditation Center in San Francisco, which Fischer now continues to direct, in the wake of Rabbi Lew’s 2009 death.\n\nFischer has written about the concept of God being integral to Judaism and many other religions. In his book \"Opening to You: Zen-Inspired Translations of the Psalms\" (Viking, 2002), Fischer replaced the words \"God\", \"King\", and \"Lord\" with the word \"You.\" He explains:\"For many of the religious seekers I encounter, the word God has been all but emptied of its spiritual power. The relationship to God that is charted out in the Psalms is a stormy one, co-dependent, passionate, confusing, loyal, petulant, sometimes even manipulative. I wanted to find a way to approach these poems so as to emphasize the relational aspect, while avoiding the major distancing pitfalls that words like God, King, Lord and so on create.\"\n\nDuring Fischer’s years at The Iowa Writers’ Workshop, he met poets associated with the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry movement of the seventies and eighties. After receiving his MFA in poetry from the University of Iowa in 1970, he moved to San Francisco where he remained associated with the movement, writing language-centered avant-garde poetry with a spiritual bent and publishing his first poems in 1979. His first collection \"Like a Walk Through a Park\" (Open Books, 1980) comprises poems written at Tassajara Zen Mountain Monastery, where he was in residence with poets Jane Hirshfield and Philip Whalen. After Whalen’s death in 2003, Fischer became his literary executor.\n\nFischer has since published over fifteen volumes of poetry. His poetry has been published in literary magazines such as \"Talisman\", \"Jacket,\" \"Mag City, Fracture, Tinfish, Bezoar, Periodics, Bombay Gin, Raddle Moon, Gallery Works, Crayon\", and \"Antenym,\" among others, and anthologized in \"The Wisdom Anthology of North American Poetry,\" and \"Basta Azzez enough\".\n\nCharles Bernstein has called Fischer’s poetry “illuminating and essential” and Ron Silliman says “nobody gives more completely of himself in the act of writing than Norman Fischer...I am in awe of this gift.”\n\nFischer is a founding board member of Poets in Need, an organization that grants emergency funds to poets in financial distress.\n\nFischer has written nine books on Zen, and numerous essays and books on writing, poetry, and spirituality. His essays have been published in magazines such as \"Buddhadharma\", \"Tricycle\" and \"Shambhala Sun\", and in collections such as \"Radical Poetics and Secular Jewish Culture\" (University of Alabama Press, 2010) and \"The Best Buddhist Writing\" (Shambhala Sun).\n\nFischer lives in Muir Beach, California with his wife Kathie, a retired middle school science teacher and ordained Zen priest. In 2012, Kathie received dharma transmission from Sojun Mel Weitzman, and since her retirement from teaching in 2016, has been co-leading Zen workshops and retreats with Norman.\n\nThey have twin sons, Aron and Noah, and three grandchildren.\n\nAron Fischer is a New York attorney, and Noah Fischer, also based in New York, is a conceptual artist and political activist, whose work is shown internationally.\n\n\n"}

He was born to a Jewish mother although he has never been an active Jew. Puhovski became well-known public figure at a very early age, for almost a trivial reason: When he became the president of his gymnasium committee of the Alliance of Socialist Youth a directive arrived to revitalise the political work with more vivacious subjects. Having discovered an article on contraception in the magazine \"Der Spiegel\" bought by his grandma, Puhovski found it a suitably \"vivacious\" subject and has on the school youth conference in 1964, in front of 400 students and all the teachers read an essay titled \"Love, sex and contraception\". Before the essay was read to the end, all the professors left the solemnly decked hall. After everything was over, Puhovski was expelled from the League of Communists of Croatia. Miko Tripalo, the newly elected secretary of the City Committee of the League of Communists called for him, and told him: \"I also had adventures here and there, but I was never punished by the Party, not even by a reprimand! What have you, for god's sake, in this age managed to achieve that you're being expelled from the Party because of sex?\". After Tripalo realised what happened, he did his best to whitewash the halo of martyr of Puhovski and the punishment has been canceled.\n\nAfter studying physics for two years he heads for Germany, but returns in 1968 enrolling to the Faculty of Political Sciences. In December 1969 he was appointed as the editor-in-chief of the \"Omladinski tjednik\" (\"Youth weekly\"), taking only 4 months to be discharged. The newspapers he edited were banned for insulting the President of the Republic. It was in March 1970 that he published on the third page of the newspaper a critical introductory on the 10th assembly of the Central Committee of the Communists of Croatia, and on the last page he reprinted a text of the Ljubljana's periodical \"Delo\". In the cinema shows schedule \"Delo\" has behind the title \"Filmske novosti - Tito u Tanzaniji\" (\"Film news - Tito in Tanzania\") brought a summary of film's plot, bu without the film's title. The summary went: \"Veliki boss sakupio je svoj tim - stručnjake za oružje, drogu i prostituciju - i krenuo u osvajanje svijeta.\" (\"The great boss has gathered his team - experts for weapons, drug and the prostitution - and went to conquer the world\"). Puhovski translated, magnified and published that text.\n\nIn 1971 he was a witness on the trial of Croatian student leaders (Dražen Budiša, Ivan Zvonimir Čičak). Twenty years later, in a charged nationalist atmosphere, Puhovski has been for this trial depicted as an \"anti-Croat\" and \"traitor\" of his colleagues. However, Budiša stated some time later that there was nothing contentious in the testimony of Puhovski, and according to the words of Duško Čizmić Marović:\n\nFrom 1973 Puhovski works as an assistant in the Institute for Philosophy at the University of Zagreb, and since 1975 he teaches political philosophy at the Faculty of Philosophy. As a professor he held guest lectures at the Universities of Berlin, Frankfurt, London, Brighton, Klagenfurt and Valencia. He is a member of The Ethikon Institute in Los Angeles. He is the scientific director of the European University Center for Peace Studies in Stadtschlaining.\n\nHe served as an editor in various periodicals: \"Ideje\" (1970–1973); \"Kulturni radnik\" (1971–1982); \"Praxis\" (1973–1975); \"Teka\" (1975); \"Filozofska istraživanja\" (1980–1986). He translated numerous books and studies from German and English, published about two hundred works in political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of culture, jurisprudence and social sciences. He is the co-founder of the first alternative Yugoslav political organisation UJDI (\"Udruženje za Jugoslavensku demokratsku inicijativu\", \"Association for Yugoslav Democratic Initiative\") in 1988, and the Croatian Helsinki Committee (HHO) in 1993, of which he is president in the period 2000-2007.
