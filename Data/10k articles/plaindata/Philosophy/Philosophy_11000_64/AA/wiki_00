Moore (philosopher)\n\nAdrian William Moore (born 1956) is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford and Tutorial Fellow of St Hugh's College, Oxford. His main areas of interest are: Kant, Wittgenstein, history of philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of logic and language, ethics and philosophy of religion.\n\nDescribed as \"one of our very best... contemporary philosophers\", his first book, \"The Infinite\", published by Routledge in 1990, was considered an \"authoritative overview of a topic of considerable philosophical importance\", a \"fine book... admirably clear... [subtle and] sensitive to the philosophical issues.\" The book was also reviewed favourably in \"Philosophia Mathematica\", \"International Philosophical Quarterly\", \"Times Higher Education Supplement\", and \"Choice\".\n\nThis was followed by \"Points of View\" (Oxford University Press 1997): \"... a superb book. It brings the rigour, clarity and precision of the best analytical philosophy to bear on a topic that has until now been of pointedly little concern within analytical philosophy.\" His third book, \"Noble in Reason, Infinite in Faculty: Themes and Variations in Kant's Moral and Religious Philosophy\" was reviewed very laudatorily in \"Mind\", \"Times Literary Supplement\" and \"Kantian Review\".\n\nHis most recent book was published in 2012 by Cambridge University Press with the title \"The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things\". It has been called an “important and remarkable book” and said to represent “an extremely impressive achievement.”\n\nA. W. Moore was educated at The Manchester Grammar School. He graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy from King’s College, Cambridge, after which he went to Oxford where he studied at Balliol College for his B.Phil and D.Phil in Philosophy, completing the latter with a thesis on \"Language, Time and Ontology\" under the supervision of Michael Dummett. During his time as a postgraduate at Oxford Moore was awarded the John Locke Prize in Mental Philosophy (in 1980).\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Moore spent three years as a lecturer at University College, Oxford, where he also acted as the Junior Dean. He then returned to Cambridge as a Junior Research Fellow at King's College. Since 1988 he has been a Tutorial Fellow at St Hugh's College, Oxford and a University Lecturer in Philosophy. Since 2004, he has been a University Professor of Philosophy. He has also been the Chairman of the Oxford University Philosophical Society (1995–96), Chairman of the Sub-faculty of Philosophy (1997–99), and President of the Aristotelian Society (2014–2015).\n\nHe is currently a Delegate of the Oxford University Press and he has been editor of the journal \"MIND\" since 2015, joint with Lucy O'Brien. In October 2017 he was appointed Vice-Principal of St Hugh’s College.\n\nMoore was awarded the Mind Association Research Fellowship (1999–2000) and a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship (2006–09).\n\nIn September 2016 he presented a ten-part BBC Radio 4 series entitled \"A History of the Infinite\".\n\nOne of Moore's distinctive contributions to the area of contemporary metaphysics is a bold defence of the idea that it is possible to think about the world 'from no point of view'. This defence is presented in his book, \"Points of View\", which is at the same time a study of ineffability and nonsense. Drawing on Kant and Wittgenstein, he considers transcendental idealism which, he argues, is nonsense resulting from the attempt to express certain inexpressible insights. He applies this idea to a wide range of fundamental philosophical issues, including the nature of persons, value, and God.\n\nMoore's most recent work has been devoted to a thorough study of the history of metaphysics since Descartes, published under the title \"The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things\". Taking as its definition of metaphysics ‘the most general attempt to make sense of things’, the study charts the evolution of metaphysics through various competing conceptions of its possibility, scope and limits: it deals with the early modern period, the late modern period in the analytic tradition and the late modern period in non-analytic traditions. Moore challenges the still prevalent conviction that there is some unbridgeable gulf between analytic philosophy and philosophy of other kinds. He also advances his own distinctive conception of what metaphysics is and why it matters.\n\nMoore is well known not only for his work in the areas or metaphysics and history of philosophy, but also for his contributions to the philosophy of logic and the philosophy of mathematics. In particular, Moore has done much work on the nature of infinity which illustrates his ramified interests. In his book \"The Infinite\", Moore offers a thorough discussion of the idea of infinity and its history, and a defence of finitism. He engages with a wide range of approaches and issues in the history of thought about the infinite, including various paradoxes, as well as the problems of human finitude and death.\n\nIn the areas of ethics and religious philosophy, one of the main questions addressed by Moore is this: Is it possible for ethical thinking to be grounded in pure reason? In \"Noble in Reason, Infinite in Faculty: Themes and Variations in Kant's Moral and Religious Philosophy\", Moore looks at Kant’s moral and religious philosophy and uses it to arrive at a distinctive way of understanding and answering this question. Moore identifies three Kantian themes – morality, freedom and religion – and offers variations on each of these themes in turn. He concedes that there are difficulties with the Kantian view that morality can be governed by ‘pure’ reason, but defends a closely related view involving a notion of reason culturally and socially conditioned.\n\nMoore also has a special interest in the work of Bernard Williams, with whom he was a colleague in Cambridge and about whom he has written extensively. After Williams’ death in 2003 Moore was appointed as one of his literary executors. He edited one of Williams’ posthumously published collections of essays, \"Philosophy as a Humanistic Discipline\".\n\n\n\n"}

Hills, rocks, waterholes, trees, plains and other natural features may be sacred sites. In coastal and sea areas, sacred sites may include features which lie both above and below water. Sometimes sacred sites are obvious, such as ochre deposits, rock art galleries, or spectacular natural features. In other instances sacred sites may be unremarkable to an outside observer. They can range in size from a single stone or plant, to an entire mountain range.\n\n\"The Dreaming\" refers collectively to Aboriginal religious beliefs. These beliefs endeavour to explain the questions of ultimate human reality, including the origins of humans and animals. The Dreaming is an ongoing phenomenon, incorporating the past, the present and the future. Aboriginal people believe that the Spirits who initially inhabited the land were their ancestors and their identity is derived from the Spirits from whom they descended. Particular tribes have their own totem which is an animal often native to their tribe's territory. Their traditional way of life is based on their relationship with the land, which they believe to be their origin, sustenance and ultimate destiny. They believe it is their duty to look after the land and take only what is needed. The beliefs of the Dreaming are diverse and various. They depend on an individual's tribe, gender, location and totem.\n\nThe traditional custodians of the sacred sites in an area are the tribal elders. \"Sacred sites give meaning to the natural landscape. They anchor values and kin-based relationships in the land. Custodians of sacred sites are concerned for the safety of all people, and the protection of sacred sites is integral to ensuring the well-being of the country and the wider community.\" These sites are or were used for many sacred traditions and customs. Sites used for male activities, such as initiation ceremonies, may be forbidden to women; sites used for female activities, such as giving birth, may be forbidden to men.\n\nBefore 1965 there was no legislation protecting Aboriginal sites in Australia, with the exception of some regulations in the Northern Territory. In 1965, the South Australian Government was the first to introduce legislation, and all other States have since done so.\n\nLegislation relating to the protection and management of sacred sites in Australia includes:\n\nCriminal offences apply under Commonwealth and state and territory laws for unauthorised access to sacred sites. Damage to these sites can also result in civil penalties.\n\nSome documented examples of Aboriginal sacred sites in Australia include:\n\n\nIn June 2008 BBC released the series \"Ray Mears Goes Walkabout\", composed of four episodes, where Mears tours the Australian outback. An accompanying hardcover book was published in the UK by Hodder and Stoughton in March 2008. In the series, Mears meets one of his heroes, Les Hiddins (a.k.a. \"The Bush Tucker Man\"), and he also headed to the Kimberley region to meet the reputed aboriginal artist and bush guide Juju Wilson.\n"}

{"id": "18966509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18966509", "title": "Camera trap", "text": "Camera trap\n\nA camera trap is a remotely activated camera that is equipped with a motion sensor or an infrared sensor, or uses a light beam as a trigger. Camera trapping is a method for capturing wild animals on film when researchers are not present, and has been used in ecological research for decades. In addition to applications in hunting and wildlife viewing, research applications include studies of nest ecology, detection of rare species, estimation of population size and species richness, as well as research on habitat use and occupation of human-built structures.\n\nCamera traps, also known as trail cameras, are used to capture images of wildlife with as little human interference as possible. Since the introduction of commercial infrared-triggered cameras in the early 1990s their use has increased. With advancements in the quality of camera equipment this method of field observation has become more popular among researchers. Hunting has played an important role in development of camera traps, since hunters like to use them to scout for game. These hunters have opened a commercial market for the devices which have led to many improvements over time.\n\nThe great advantage of camera traps is that they can record very accurate data without disturbing the photographed animal. These data are superior to human observations, because they can be reviewed by other researchers. \nThey minimally disturb wildlife and can replace the use of more invasive survey and monitoring techniques such as live trap and release. They operate continually and silently, provide proof of species presence in an area, can reveal what prints and scats belong to which species, provide evidence for management and policy decisions, and are a cost effective monitoring tool. Infrared flash cameras have low disturbance and visibility. Besides olfactory and acoustic cues, camera flash may scare animals so that they avoid or destroy camera traps. The major alternative light source is infrared, which is usually not detectable by mammals or birds.\n\nCamera traps are also helpful in quantifying the number of different species in an area; this is a more effective method than attempting to count by hand every individual organism in a field. It can also be useful in identifying new or rare species that have yet to be well documented. By using camera traps, the well-being and survival rate of animals can be observed over time. \nCamera traps are helpful in determining behavioral and activity patterns of animals, such as which time of day they visit mineral licks. \nCamera traps are also useful to record animal migrations.\n\nCamera traps have revolutionized wildlife research and conservation, enabling collection of photographic evidence of rarely seen and often globally endangered species, with little expense, relative ease, and minimal disturbance to wildlife. Camera traps can document wildlife presence, abundance, and population changes, particularly in the face of deforestation and habitat destruction. Camera traps enable collection of baseline population data on elusive mammals and birds where only estimates — and often just guesses — were possible before. Camera traps are increasingly being used to raise conservation awareness worldwide, with Non-governmental organizations (NGO)s embracing the tool as a powerful way of reaching out to the public through electronic media. Wildlife conservation groups such as Panthera, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have found camera trap videos and photos to be an important part of campaigns to save threatened or endangered species.\n\nThe earliest models used traditional film and a one-shot trigger function. These cameras contained film that needed to be collected and developed like any other standard camera. Today, more advanced cameras utilize digital photography, sending photos directly to a computer. Even though this method is uncommon it is highly useful and could be the future of this research method. Some cameras are even programmed to take multiple pictures after a triggering event.\n\nThere are non-triggered cameras that either run continuously or take pictures at specific time intervals. The more common ones are the advanced cameras that are triggered only after sensing movement and/or a heat signature to increase the chances of capturing a useful image. Infrared beams can also be used to trigger the camera. Video is also an emerging option in camera traps, allowing researchers to record running streams of video and to document animal behavior.\n\nThe battery life of some of these cameras is another important factor in which cameras are used; large batteries offer a longer running time for the camera but can be cumbersome in set up or when lugging the equipment to the field site .\n\nWeather proof and waterproof housing for camera traps protect the equipment from damage and disguise the equipment from animals.\n\nNoise-reduction housing limits the possibility of disturbing and scaring away animals. Sound recording is another feature that can be added to the camera to record animal calls and times when specific animals are the most vocal.\n\nHumidity has a highly negative effect on camera traps and can result in camera malfunction.\nThis can be problematic since the malfunction is often not immediately discovered, so a large portion of research time can be lost. Often a researcher expecting the experiment to be complete will trek back to the site, only to discover far less data than expected – or even none at all.\n\nThe best type of weather for it to work in is any place with low humidity and stable moderate temperatures.\nThere is also the possibility, if it is a motion activated camera, that any movement within the sensitivity range of the camera’s sensor will trigger a picture, so the camera might end up with numerous pictures of anything the wind moves, such as plants.\n\nAs far as problems with camera traps, it cannot be overlooked that sometimes the subjects themselves negatively affect the research. One of the most common things is that animals unknowingly topple a camera or splatter it with mud or water ruining the film or lens. One other method of animal tampering involves the animals themselves taking the cameras for their own uses. There are examples of some animals actually taking the cameras and snapping pictures of themselves.\n\nLocal people sometimes use the same game trails as wildlife, and hence are also photographed by camera traps placed along these trails. This can make camera traps a useful tool for anti-poaching or other law enforcement effort.\n\nOne of the most important things to consider when setting up camera traps is choosing the location in order to get the best results. Camera traps near mineral licks or along game trails, where it is more likely that animals will visit frequently, are normally seen. Animals congregate around mineral licks to consume water and soil, which can be useful in reducing toxin levels or supplement mineral intake in their diet. These locations for camera traps also allow for variety of animals who show up at different times and use the licks in different ways allowing for the study of animal behavior.\n\nAnother major factor in whether this is the best technique to use in the specific research is which type of species one is attempting to observe with the camera. Species such as small-bodied birds and insects may be too small to trigger the camera. Reptiles and amphibians will not be able to trip the infrared or heat differential-based sensors, however, methods have been developed to detect these species by utilizing a reflector based sensor system. However, for most medium and large-bodied terrestrial species camera traps have proven to be a successful tool for study.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "384236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=384236", "title": "Crank (person)", "text": "Crank (person)\n\n\"Crank\" is a pejorative term used for a person who holds an unshakable belief that most of his or her contemporaries consider to be false. A crank belief is so wildly at variance with those commonly held that it is considered ludicrous. Cranks characteristically dismiss all evidence or arguments which contradict their own unconventional beliefs, making any rational debate a futile task and rendering them impervious to facts, evidence, and rational inference.\n\nCommon synonyms for \"crank\" include crackpot and kook. A crank differs from a fanatic in that the subject of the fanatic's obsession is either not necessarily widely regarded as wrong or not necessarily a \"fringe\" belief. Similarly, the word \"quack\" is reserved for someone who promotes a medical remedy or practice that is widely considered to be ineffective; this term, however, does not imply any deep belief in the idea or product they are attempting to sell. \"Crank\" may also refer to an ill-tempered individual or one who is in a bad mood, but that usage is not the subject of this article.\n\nAlthough experts in the field find a crank's beliefs ridiculous, cranks are sometimes very successful in convincing non-experts of their views. A famous example is the Indiana Pi Bill where a state legislature nearly wrote into law a crank result in geometry.\n\nOld English \"cranc-\" is preserved in modern English crankshaft, and obsolete \"crancstaef\" \"a weaver's instrument\".\nIt is from a Proto-Germanic stem \"*krank-\" meaning \"bend\". German \"krank\" has a modern meaning of \"sick, ill\", evolved from a former meaning \"weak, small\". English \"crank\" in its modern sense is first recorded 1833, and \"cranky\" in a sense of \"irritable\" dates from 1821. The term was popularised in 1872 for being applied to Horace Greeley who was ridiculed during his campaign for the U.S. presidency. In 1882, the term was used to describe Charles Guiteau, who shot U.S. president James Garfield. Following news reports of Guiteau's trial, \"crank\" spread to describe obsessed baseball fans.\n\nIn 1906, \"Nature\" offered essentially the same definition which is used here:\nThe word \"crackpot\" apparently also first appeared in 1883:\nIn \"Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary\", the terms \"crackpot\", \"crackbrain\", and \"cracked\" are synonymous, and suggest a metaphorically \"broken\" head. The terms \"crazy\" and \"crazed\" also originally meant \"broken\" and derive from the same root word as \"cracked\". The dictionary gives no indication that \"pate\" and \"pot\" have the same root, despite their apparent similarity, and implied colloquial use of \"pot\" to mean \"head\" in the word \"crackpot\". However, the term \"craze\" is also used to refer to minute cracks in pottery glaze, again suggesting the metaphorical connection of cracked pots with questionable mental health.\n\nThe term \"kook\" appears to be much more recent. The adjectival-form, \"kooky\", was apparently coined as part of American teenager (or beatnik) slang, which derives from the pejorative meaning of the noun cuckoo. In late 1958, Edd Byrnes first played a hair-combing parking lot attendant called \"Kookie\" on 77 Sunset Strip. The noun-form \"kook\", was defined in 1960 in Britain's \"Daily Mail\" newspaper as \"a screwball who is 'gone' farther than most\".\n\nThe second book of the mathematician and popular author Martin Gardner was a study of crank beliefs, \"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\". More recently, the mathematician Underwood Dudley has written a series of books on mathematical cranks, including \"The Trisectors\", \"Mathematical Cranks\", and \"Numerology: Or, What Pythagoras Wrought\". And in a 1992 UseNet post, the mathematician John Baez humorously proposed a checklist, the Crackpot index, intended to diagnose cranky beliefs regarding contemporary physics.\n\nAccording to these authors, virtually universal characteristics of cranks include:\n\nSome cranks lack academic achievement, in which case they typically assert that academic training in the subject of their crank belief is not only unnecessary for discovering the truth, but actively harmful because they believe it poisons the minds by teaching falsehoods. Others greatly exaggerate their personal achievements, and may insist that some achievement (real or alleged) in some entirely unrelated area of human endeavor implies that their cranky opinion should be taken seriously.\n\nSome cranks claim vast knowledge of any relevant literature, while others claim that familiarity with previous work is entirely unnecessary; regardless, cranks inevitably reveal that whether or not they believe themselves to be knowledgeable concerning relevant matters of fact, mainstream opinion, or previous work, they are not, in fact, well-informed concerning the topic of their belief.\n\nIn addition, many cranks:\n\nCranks who contradict some mainstream opinion in some highly technical field, (e.g. mathematics, cryptography, physics) frequently:\nThat is, cranks tend to ignore any previous insights which have been proven by experience to facilitate discussion and analysis of the topic of their cranky claims; indeed, they often assert that these innovations \"obscure\" rather than \"clarify\" the situation.\n\nIn addition, cranky scientific theories do not in fact qualify as theories as this term is commonly understood within science. For example, crank theories in physics typically fail to result in testable predictions, which makes them unfalsifiable and hence unscientific. Or the crank may present their ideas in such a confused, not even wrong manner that it is impossible to determine what they are actually claiming.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, many cranks may appear quite normal when they are not passionately expounding their cranky belief, and they may even be successful in careers unrelated to their cranky beliefs.\n\nThe rise of the Internet has given another outlet to people well outside the mainstream who may get labeled cranks due to internet postings or websites promoting particular beliefs. There are a number of websites devoted to listing people as cranks. Community-edited websites like Wikipedia have been described as vulnerable to cranks.\n\nScience fiction author and critic Bruce Sterling noted in his essay in CATSCAN 13:\nOnline communication can wonderfully liberate the tender soul of some well-meaning personage who, for whatever reason, is physically uncharismatic. Unfortunately, online communication also fertilizes the eccentricities of hopeless cranks, who at last find themselves in firm possession of a wondrous soapbox that the Trilateral Commission and the Men In Black had previously denied them.\n\nThere are also newsgroups which are nominally devoted to discussing (\"alt.usenet.kooks\") or poking fun at (\"alt.slack, alt.religion.kibology\") supposed cranks.\n\nThe term crank magnetism was coined by physiologist and blogger Mark Hoofnagle on the \"Denialism Blog\" in 2007 to describe the propensity of cranks to hold multiple irrational, unsupported or ludicrous beliefs that are often unrelated to one another, referring to his claims that William Dembski endorses both a Holocaust denier and a conspiracy theory put forward by Peter Duesberg. Crank magnetism may be considered to operate wherever a single person propounds a number of unrelated denialist conjectures, poorly supported conspiracy theories, or pseudoscientific claims. Thus, some of the common crank characteristics — such as the lack of technical ability, ignorance of scientific terminology, and claims that alternative ideas are being suppressed by the mainstream — may be operating on and manifested in multiple orthogonal assertions.\n\nHoofnagle's fellow blogger Orac has discussed crank magnetism in relation to the writings of British columnist Melanie Phillips, whom he alleges denies anthropogenic global warming while promoting intelligent design and the discredited view that the MMR vaccine causes autism in children. Blogger Luke Scientiæ has commented on the relationship between the number of unrelated claims that magnetic cranks make and the extent of their open hostility to science. He has also coined the phrase \"magnetic hoax\" in relation to hoax claims that attract multiple crank interpretations.\n\nOne study, \"NASA faked the moon landing—Therefore (Climate) Science is a Hoax: An Anatomy of the Motivated Rejection of Science\", gave evidence that climate change denial correlated with moon landing and 9/11 conspiracy theories, staunch beliefs in \"laissez-faire\" free-market capitalism, denial of the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer, HIV/AIDS denialism and MLK death conspiracy theories:\n\nAlthough nearly all domain experts agree that human CO2 emissions are altering the world's climate, segments of the public remain unconvinced by the scientific evidence. Internet blogs have become a vocal platform for climate denial, and bloggers have taken a prominent and influential role in questioning climate science. We report a survey (N > 1100) of climate blog users to identify the variables underlying acceptance and rejection of climate science. Paralleling previous work, we find that endorsement of a \"laissez-faire\" conception of free-market economics predicts rejection of climate science (r ' .80 between latent constructs). Endorsement of the free market also predicted the rejection of other established scientific findings, such as the facts that HIV causes AIDS and that smoking causes lung cancer. We additionally show that endorsement of a cluster of conspiracy theories (e.g., that the CIA killed Martin-Luther King or that NASA faked the moon landing) predicts rejection of climate science as well as the rejection of other scientific findings, above and beyond endorsement of \"laissez-faire\" free markets. This provides empirical confirmation of previous suggestions that conspiracist ideation contributes to the rejection of science. Acceptance of science, by contrast, was strongly associated with the perception of a consensus among scientists.\n\nAnother study titled \"Dead and Alive: Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories\" managed to show that, not only will cranks be attracted to and believe in numerous conspiracy theories all at once, but will continue to do so even if the theories in question are completely and utterly incompatible with one another. For instance, the study showed that: \"... the more participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed that she was murdered [and that] ... the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. special forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive,\" and that \"Hierarchical regression models showed that mutually incompatible conspiracy theories are positively associated because both are associated with the view that the authorities are engaged in a cover-up\".\n\nStudies such as \"Belief in Conspiracy Theories\" state that conspiracy theories relating to the assassination of JFK, the moon landing and the September 11th attacks are united by a common thread: distrust of the government-endorsed story. This leads the believer to attach other conspiracies as well. Someone with a distrust of the government will likely reject any and all stories or reports directly issued by state agencies or other authorities that are seen as part of the establishment. Thus, any conspiracy will seem more plausible to the conspiracy theorist because this fits with their worldview.\n\nIn academic sociology, a similar notion to crank magnetism exists, namely Colin Campbell's concept of the \"cultic milieu\", which he used:\n...to refer to a society's deviant belief systems and practices and their associated collectivities, institutions, individuals, and media of communication. He described it as including \"the worlds of the occult and the magical, of spiritualism and psychic phenomena, of mysticism and new thought, of alien intelligences and lost civilizations, of faith healing and nature cure\" (Campbell 1972:122), and it can be seen, more generally, to be the point at which deviant science meets deviant religion. What unifies these diverse elements, apart from a consciousness of their deviant status and an ensuing sense of common cause, is an overlapping communication structure of magazines, pamphlets, lectures, and informal meetings, together with the common ideology of \"seekership\".\n\nMichael Barkun's book \"A Culture of Conspiracy\" traces the history of certain UFO and \"New World Order\" conspiracy theories. He finds that these theories and communities were originally distinct, but that certain bookshops and magazines would sell/advertise books of both genres. He traces, over the years, the gradual synthesis as ideas from one milieu start to invade another until both communities routinely refer to both, Area 51 and black helicopters as part of the same conspiracy canon, for example. He describes the process as Improvisational Millennialism, where people select from existing conspiracy theories to invent their own synthesis. But largely posits that the synthesis as driven by the theories sharing the same transmission channels.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK). On Freedom Day, 27 April 2013, he posthumously received the Order of the Baobab from the President of South Africa \"for his selfless struggle for equality ... and his dedication to community upliftment. By doing so, he lived the values of non-racialism against the mainstream of his own culture.\"\n\nBosch was born in Kuruman, Cape Province, South Africa, and died in a motor accident in 1992, aged 62. He was raised in a nationalist Afrikaner home with little regard for his nation's black citizens and in 1948 when the National Party (South Africa) came to power and began implementing its program of apartheid Bosch welcomed it.\n\nThat same year however Bosch began studying teaching at the University of Pretoria, where he joined the Student Christian Association and was more exposed to black members of the community. This began a lifelong involvement in Christian mission and he was soon questioning the apartheid system. He was married to Annemie Bosch.\n\nSensing a call to be a missionary, Bosch changed to the Theological school and graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity and a Master of Arts in languages (Afrikaans, Dutch, German). He then went to Switzerland to study for his doctorate in the field of New Testament at the University of Basel, under Oscar Cullmann, who influenced Bosch to accommodate more ecumenism.\n\nIn 1957 Bosch began a decade working as a missionary with the NGK planting churches in the Transkei.\n\nIn 1967 he took up a position as lecturer in church history and missiology at the NGK's Theological School training black church leaders in the Transkei, where he also built ties with the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, and began to develop his ministry of writing on mission theory. Bosch wrote about his concerns that the Christian mission to bring good news to black Africans could be confused with colonial and nationalistic motives that entrenched racial divisions.\n\nIsolated from the majority in the NGK who supported apartheid, Bosch left his college in 1971 to become Professor of Missiology at the University of South Africa in Pretoria, which at the time was South Africa's only interracial university. There he edited its journal \"Theologia Evangelica\" and continued to write.\n\nHe was offered the Chair of Mission and Ecumenics at Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey, United States but chose to remain working against apartheid from within South Africa and the NGK. In 1979 he helped coordinate a gathering of more than 5000 African Christians from every background as a demonstration of the church as an alternative community embodying the Kingdom of God. In 1982 he promoted an open letter to the Dutch Reformed Church, signed by more than 100 pastors and theologians, publicly condemning apartheid and calling on the church to unite with black churches.\n\nBosch also bridged evangelical and ecumenical divisions in the global church, participating in both the Lausanne Congress and World Evangelical Alliance events, while also serving the World Council of Churches. He was an active member of the International Association for Mission Studies and the key leader, and inspiration of the South African Missiological Society and founding editor of its journal, Missionalia.\n\nHe was fluent in Xhosa, Afrikaans, Dutch, German and English, and lectured widely in Europe, Britain, and North America.\n\nHe died in an automobile accident on 15 April 1992 in South Africa at the age of 62. His contribution and influence in mission studies globally was immense.\n\nMissiologist Wilbert R. Shenk, senior Professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, writes the following of Bosch in the foreword to \"Believing in the Future\"\n\nBosch wrote more than 150 journal articles and six books, including his magnum opus \"Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission\" (1991), which was jointly published by the American Society of Missiology and the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America's Orbis Books.\n\nThe book was praised as groundbreaking by Hans Küng who called it the first book on mission to implement paradigm theory. Lesslie Newbigin nominated it a new standard calling it \"a kind of Summa Missiologica\" in reference to Thomas Aquinas' foundational thirteenth century work \"Summa Theologiae\". It was selected as one of the \"Fifteen Outstanding Books of 1991\" by the \"International Bulletin of Missionary Research\".\n\nThe book surveys paradigms of mission both in the New Testament (reflecting Bosch's careful use of New Testament criticism to trace how mission dynamics shaped scriptural forms and transformations) and through Church history (highlighting that mission has always been shaped for good or ill by its context). He then explores in detail what he sees as an emerging post-modern or ecumenical missionary paradigm.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13982947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13982947", "title": "Ethical implications in contracts", "text": "Ethical implications in contracts\n\nWhen creating a contract, a negotiator is not only doing so to reach an agreement between two or more parties, but to create an agreement that is durable; whereby parties of the contract are legally bound and committed to its promises (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). A legally binding contract is defined as an exchange of promises or an agreement between parties that the law will enforce, and there is an underlying presumption for commercial agreements that parties \"intend\" to be legally bound (Contracts 2007).\n\nIn order to be a legally binding contract, most contracts must contain two elements:\nIn addition, certain contracts are required by state law to be in writing (real estate transactions, for example), while others are not.\n\nWade and Honeyman (2007, 7) describe a ‘durable’ contract as one in which all parties substantially perform without abandonment and without resorting to legal proceedings. With only anecdotal evidence, it is difficult to know what percentages of contracts are in fact breached. It is probable that the statistics vary greatly over differing class, culture, wealth and type of transaction (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). The reasons for a breach of contract are also varying, and ethical issues can emerge in some situations.\n\nSome ethical considerations which may become apparent in the durability of contracts are cultural relativism and moral relativism.\n\nGrace and Cohen (2005, 200) describe cultural relativism as the extent to which different societies and cultures have different values and ethical standards in the fields of business and organisational life. Those who embrace cultural relativism believe that all beliefs (religious, ethical, aesthetic, and political) are relative to the individual within a culture. Types of relativism include moral (where ethics depend on the social assembly), situational (where right or wrong is dependent on the situation), and cognitive (where truth itself has no objective standard). The legislative system is having a harder time defining laws with the diminishing set of standards, and our court system is having a harder time interpreting them (Cultural Relativism – Illogical Standard 2006).\n\nMoral relativism views ethical standards, morality, and positions of right or wrong as being culturally based. This therefore subjects these views as being an individual’s choice. While modern society was previously governed by a \"Judeo-Christian\" standard, this view has increasingly been acknowledged as the chief moral philosophy of modern society (Moral Relativism – Neutral Thinking?. 2006). However, these \"Judeo-Christian\" standards continue to be the foundation for civil law, as most people believe that right and wrong are not absolutes, but are determined by the individual.\n\nFollowing are reasons for breaches in contracts and the way in which these ethical considerations may impact upon them. In most of these situations, the law may not agree with moral or cultural relativism and award in favour of what people generally view as being ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. It is therefore imperative that contracts are created to be as durable as possible so parties are unable to find legal ‘loopholes’ and use their power, wealth, ignorance or cultural differences in setting contracts aside. Following these descriptions is a list of ways on which contracts can be made more durable.\n\nIn some cultural groups such as Japan, the creation of a contract symbolises the formation of a working relationship, and not a legally binding agreement. Some groups will regard the contract as being flexible in terms that if any problems or issues arise, the parties will reassess the obligations of the agreement and negotiate ways to preserve the relationship (Honeyman and Wade 2007, 8). However, this is not generally the ‘Western’ view on contracts.\n\nIn relation to the ethical issue of cultural relativism, a business is obliged to operate in a manner acceptable to the host country, both legally and morally (Grace and Cohen 2005, 19). But what if the contract is not necessarily subject to having a ‘host country’? Is it morally wrong for a Western party to hold a Japanese party to the contract when it is known that the Japanese party would not have intended to be legally bound? Or is it unethical or immoral of the Japanese to sign such an agreement, even though they mean well when signing it, knowing the Western party intended to be legally bound by the contract but themselves see the contract as more of a flexible agreement?\n\nHoneyman and Wade (2007) state that differences in cultural expectations can predictably lead to the more economically powerful party attempting to negotiate that all breaches will be dealt with ultimately by courts from their own culture, applying their own cultural and legal rules.\n\nThis then highlights the issue of different legal rules existing in different countries which enable contracts to be set aside. The list of exceptions to finality of contracts varies from one jurisdiction to another, and this is often placed under the label ‘frustration of contracts’.\n\nSome acts cannot legally take place because of a lack of informed consent. This can occur under conditions of pressures of limited time, money, exhaustion and exhortations to settle from lawyers. Another person is generally authorised to give consent if an individual is unable to. These cases sometimes result in a party refusing to comply with the terms of the contract; however, they are rarely successful as a defense to an enforcement action. Judges usually take the view that a client advised by a lawyer is strongly presumed both to have a basic understanding of legal principle, and to have given consent (Informed Consent 2007). This was the case in \"Gerbert and Gerbert\" (1990) FLC 92-137, where a husband settled for 10% of assets against his probable entitlement to 40%, and it was held that there was no miscarriage of justice as the husband acted freely and was advised to seek legal advice. In cases where an individual is provided limited facts, serious ethical issues may arise.\n\nIs it ethical to hold someone to a contract when they clearly had no awareness of exactly what they were signing and committing themselves to, due to ignorance or not? Is it ethical for a lawyer to encourage the signing of a document if they are clearly not fully understanding of the document?\n\nIf the chance of success and money is opportune to a wealthy person, their capacity and willingness can give rise to alleging various legal justifications for breach. A few years of legal expenses may only be a small proportion of their empire, and the resulting attrition and disparate investment in the conflict may eventually encourage other parties to renegotiate the disputed clauses (Honeyman and Wade 2005, 15).\n\nIn terms of moral relativism, most people would agree that it is ethically wrong to use wealth to control a situation and to ‘force’ people into renegotiating clauses in contracts if they are unable to afford the legal bill accompanying a dispute. However, as moral relativism is subject to a one’s own beliefs on what is right and wrong, some may not view using wealth as a means to control as being the wrong thing to do. In situations such as these, the ‘little man’ usually loses out and will ultimately succumb to the power of the other party or parties.\n\nUndue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another. The law presumes that in certain classes of relationship there will be a special risk of one party unduly influencing their conduct and motives for contracting (Undue Influence 2007). Because the court can vitiate such a contract if there is a special relationship, when no special relationship exists, the general rule is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.\n\nAn example of such a case is \"Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School District\" CA Ct of App 54 Ca Rpt 533 [1964]. The plaintiff was under contract as a teacher. He was arrested, and the next day he allegedly was pressured by his superiors to sign and deliver his resignation. He was cleared of the criminal charges, and then he sought to be reinstated by the school district. They refused, so he sued to rescind his resignation. He claimed that his resignation should not be enforced because, among other things, he signed it under the \"undue influence\" of his superiors.\n\nWhen a party has placed their confidence and trust in another and this relationship is broken, the view of moral relativism will generally see this situation as being wrong. Undue influence is usually an act of dishonesty and/or deceit in a situation where one party realizes their power over the other and takes advantage of this. Deception and deceit are not viewed as being ethical values inherent in a person.\n\nAs Honeyman and Wade (2005, 15) point out, to increase the chances of ‘performance’ of a contract (and therefore reduce chances of a breach), a party should enhance:\n\n\nGrace, D., and S.

It is often used to describe a stable mental state or mood in those affected with bipolar disorder that is neither manic nor depressive, yet is distinguishable from healthy controls. Euthymia is also used to describe the \"baseline\" of other cyclical mood disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). This state is the goal of psychiatric and psychological interventions. \n\nThe word \"euthymia\" traces its roots to the Greek words \"eu\", meaning well, and \"thymo\", meaning soul or emotion. The word \"thymos\" also had four additional meanings: life energy; feelings and passions; desires and inclinations; and thought or intelligence. Euthymia is also derived from a verb, \"euthymeo\", that means both \"I am happy, in good spirits\" and \"I make others happy, I reassure and encourage\". This is the basis on which the first formal definition of euthymia was built.\n\nDemocritus said that the state of euthymia is when \"one is satisfied with what is present and available, taking little heed of people who are envied and admired and observing the lives of those who suffer and yet endure\". This was later amended in the translation given by the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger in which euthymia means a state of internal calm and contentment. Seneca was also the first to link the state of euthymia to a learning process; in order to achieve it, one must be aware of psychological well-being. Seneca's definition included a cache about detachment from current events. Later, the Greek biographer Plutarch removed this cache with his definition which focused more on learning from adverse events.\n\nIn 1958, Marie Jodah gave a modern clinical definition of mental health in the terms of positive symptoms by outlining the criteria for mental health: \"autonomy (regulation of behavior from within), environmental mastery, satisfactory interactions with other people and the milieu, the individual’s style and degree of growth, development or self-actualization, the attitudes of an individual toward his/her own self\". In her definition she acknowledged the absence of disease as being necessary, but not enough, to constitute positive mental health, or euthymia.\n\nCarol Ryff (1989) was the first to develop a comprehensive scale that could assess euthymia: the Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being. The 84-item scale includes facets of self-acceptance, positive relations with others autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. It did not include a notion of resilience, which people in the field started working to add in the 2000s.\n\nParathymia on the other hand, is related to pathological laughter (called \"Witzelsucht\").\n"}

During his lifetime he spänt many years in Multan, (present day Pakistan) as well as Konya and Tokat in present-day Turkey. He is known by many Sufis as a commenter on Sufi teachings, one of the great Persian poets, and an artist. ‘Iraqi is also considered to have reached an exalted station of spiritual realization within the Sufi tradition.\n\nBorn in 1213, ‘Iraqi lived during the height of the revival of Islamic spirituality. ‘Iraqi was highly educated in both theology and literary disciplines and it is believed that he not only knew the Holy Qur'an, hadith, commentary and Islamic theology (Kalam), but that he also knew Persian and Arabic literature. By the time he was seventeen ‘Iraqi had learned all the sciences there were to teach, and had even begun to teach others.\n\nSoon after he began teaching he met a group of qalandars or wandering dervishes and decided to join them. The group traveled to Multan where he would eventually be in the service of Baha-ud-din Zakariya who was the head of the Suhrawardiyya. Soon after he arrived in Multan he was betrothed to Shaykh's daughter and would have a son with her named Kabiruddin. ‘Iraqi would be in the service of Shaykh for a total of seventeen years during which time he continued to write poetry.\n\nAfter Shaykh's death ‘Iraqi left Multan and traveled first to Mecca and Medina and then towards present day Turkey. While in Konya where ‘Iraqi settled for a while he had the honor of meeting Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi and Jalaluddin Rumi, two of the best known Sufis of all time. ‘Iraqi would become good friends with Rumi however Quanwi would become a second Sufi master to ‘Iraqi who helped to shape him intellectually, as Shaykh shaped him spiritually. After Rumi's death ‘Iraqi moved to Tokat, also in present-day Turkey.\n\nAs ‘Araghi entered old age there was much upheaval in Tokat. The Byzantine Empire and Prince Kangirtay did not like ‘Iraqi because of the great influence he had over many of the people in Tokat, and the respect with which people honored him. And so, when Prince Kangirtay tried to have ‘Iraqi arrested he fled to Cairo. From there ‘Iraqi settled in Damascus where he would eventually die at the age of seventy-eight in 1289.\n\n‘Araghi was both a member of the school of Persian Sufi poetry but also has been identified with the Ibn Arabian school of Sufism. However, ‘Iraqi was also a Gnostic who often spoke in the language of love. For him, as well as many other Sufis, love was realized knowledge. ‘Iraqi's writing \"Lama’at\" (\"Divine Flashes\") fits into a genre of Sufi writings which expresses certain doctrines in the language of love.\n\nAs Shaykh Baha'uddin was dying, he named Fakhruddin 'Iraqi to be his successor.\n\nWhen it became known that 'Iraqi had been named head of the Suhrawardi Order, some in the order became jealous and denounced him to the Sultan who sought to have 'Araghi arrested.\n\n'Iraqi fled the area with a few close companions, and they eventually made their way to Makkah and Medina. Later they moved north to Konya in Turkey. This was Konya at the time of Rumi. 'Araghi often listened to Rumi teach and recite poetry, and later attended Rumi's funeral.\n\nAlthough 'Araghi was nominally the head (in exile) of a large and respected Sufi order, he humbly became the disciple of another Sufi master Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi, who also lived in Konya at the time. Qunawi was the son-in-law of the recently deceased Sufi philosopher Ibn 'Arabi. Although less known in the West today, Qunawi was perhaps the pre-eminent Sufi teacher in Konya at the time, even better known than his neighbor Rumi.\n\n'Iraqi was deeply devoted to Qunawi and to the teachings of Ibn 'Arabi. It was a series of speeches al-Qunawi delivered on the esoteric meaning of Ibn 'Arabi's great works that inspired 'Iraqi to compose his own masterpiece of commentary and poetry named the Lama'at or Divine Flashes.\n\n\"Lama’at\" or \"Divine Flashes\" is the best known of ‘Iraqi's writings and was written during his time in what is now Turkey. A part of the ‘language of love’ genre within Sufi writing, it takes an interesting view on how one view the world. Unlike others before him ‘Iraqi viewed the world as a mirror which reflected God's Names and Qualities and not as a \"veil\" which must be lifted.\nAccording to (the late) Baljit Singh Ph.D., an Indian Persian scholar and translator of SWANEH of Ahmad Ghazali and Iraqi's LAMMAT (The Flashes), \"The style of Lammat is a simple, dignified, fluent & rich with Qur'anic verses and Arabic sentences. Its theme is ‘Divine Love’ and is written in the fashion of the Swaneh of Ahmad Ghazali. Iraqi explains in the Lammat, Ibn Arabi's Sufism through the love symbology.\" He quotes from Saed Nafisi's ‘Introduction’ to the ‘Kullyat Iraqi’-‘Generally it is accepted that Iraqi wrote Lammat following the ideas of Ibn Arabi, but Iraqi himself says differently. He writes in the beginning of the Lammat that he has written this book in the manner of ‘Swaneh’ of Ahmad Ghazali.’ Baljit Singh further refers to Dr Nasrullah Pourjavadi, a scholar on Ahmad Ghazali and writes, \"It was Ahmad Ghazali who first of all saw the Divine as love and founded the Sufi Metaphysics of Love. Iraqi is said to have united Ahmad Ghazali to Ibn Arabi through his LAMMAT.\"\n\nThe \"Lama’at\" has been translated into English, French and Swedish.\n\n\"‘Ushshaq-namah\" () was, according to legend, written during ‘Iraqi's time in service to Shaykh and is dedicated to Shamsuddin Juwayni the vizier. While it has been attributed to 'Iraqi, it is almost definitely not his.\n\n"}

It is the first Gnostic church in modern times.\n\nThe esoteric Freemason Jules Doinel, while working as archivist for the library of Orléans in France, he discovered a medieval manuscript dated 1022, which had been written by Stephen, a canon of the Orléans Cathedral, burned at the stake in 1022 for his pre-Cathar Gnostic doctrines (see Orléans heresy). Doinel founded the Gnostic Church in 1890, a date which opened for him and his followers ‘the 1st year of the Restoration of Gnosis’. Doinel claimed that he had a vision in which the Aeon Jesus appeared, He charged Doinel with the work of establishing a new church. When Doinel attended a séance in the oratory of the Countess of Caithness, it appears that the disembodied spirits of ancient Albigensians, joined by a heavenly voice, laid spiritual hands on Doinel, creating him the bishop of the Gnostic Church.\n\nAs patriarch of the new Church, Doinel took the mystical name ‘Valentinus II, Bishop of the Holy Assembly of the Paraclete and of the Gnostic Church’, and nominated eleven titular bishops, including a ‘sophia’ (female bishop), as well as deacons and deaconesses. The Symbolist poet was named bishop of Bordeaux. The dress of Gnostic bishops is characterized by purple gloves and the use of Tau symbol, a Greek letter which is also used before their names.\n\nIn 1892, Doinel consecrated Papus—founder of the first Martinist Order—as Tau Vincent, Bishop of Toulouse. Other Martinists, such as and were also consecrated by Doinel. At the end of 1894, Doinel abjured his Gnostic faith and converted to Roman Catholicism due to the Taxil hoax. He returned to Gnosticism five years later under the mystical name Simon and the title ‘Primate of Samaria’.\n\nIn 1908, a schism occurred when the Gnostic bishop of Lyons, Jean Bricaud, renamed his branch as (E.G.C.; Catholic Gnostic Church). Then it changed again becoming the (E.G.U.; Universal Gnostic Church) and became the official church of Papus’ Martinist Order. The patriarch Bricaud claimed the spiritual heritage of John of Patmos. The E.G.U. later changed its name to (E.G.A.; Apostolic Gnostic Church). Meanwhile, the original in Paris had been taken over by Léon Champrenaud (Théophane), it later disintegrated under Patrice Genty (Basilide) in 1926.\n\nThe (E.G.C.A.), in Latin (not to be confused with ), or known as the Gnostic Catholic Apostolic Church of North America, which operates in New York, claims the heritage of . This church is in a state of fraternal alliance (concordat) with the Ecclesia Gnostica. Like the latter, it also accepts the ordination of women and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn addition, the E.G.C.A. has affiliation with two other initiatic organisations: the \"Ordre Martiniste of North America\" and the \"Aesthetic Rose+Croix Order of the Temple and the Grail\". The latter is a reconstitution of Joséphin Péladan’s Ordre de la Rose ✠ Croix Catholique et Esthétique du Temple et du Graal.\n\nThe \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" (E.G.C.) descended from a line of the 19th-century French Gnostic revival churches () mentioned above (see Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica#History). These plus the contemporary are essentially Christian in nature. Although Gnosticism is seen as heresy in an orthodox Christian sense, the E.G.C. goes even further by worshipping such figures like Babalon, Baphomet, et cetera.\n\n"}

It contains a wide variety of material from many different authors over several successive centuries, largely associated with the 4th century BCE Jixia Academy in the Qi capital of Linzi, but it might not have been compiled until after the Han Feizi.\n\nThe Ming dynasty agricultural scientist Xu Guangqi frequently cited the Guanzi and the Xunzi.\n\nAs is typical of an ancient Chinese text, the organization of the \"Guanzi\" has been altered over time, both the chronology and significance of which isn't all that clear. Covering a wide variety of subjects, ranging from detailed economic discussions to overviews of local soil topography, many chapters include Confucian values as a necessity for the state, expressing a blend of what may be considered Legalistic, Confucian, and Daoistic philosophy that has been termed \"Huang-Lao\". The first reference to the collection appears in the more Taostic Huainanzi, of the early Han dynasty, and Han bibliographies listed the text as Taoist. For example, the \"Neiye\" (\"Inner Enterprise/Training\") chapter has some of the oldest recorded descriptions of Daoist meditation techniques.\n\nWhen you enlarge your mind and let go of it,<br>\nWhen you relax your [\"qi\" 氣] vital breath and expand it, <br>\nWhen your body is calm and unmoving: <br>\nAnd you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. <br>\nYou will see profit and not be enticed by it, <br>\nYou will see harm and not be frightened by it. <br>\nRelaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive, <br>\nIn solitude you delight in your own person. <br>\nThis is called \"revolving the vital breath\": <br>\nYour thoughts and deeds seem heavenly.

Considering their tone generally less strident than in the classic Legalist work, the \"Book of Lord Shang\" (\"Shang jun shu\" 商君書), translator W. Allyn Rickett dissents from the traditional Confucian view of the texts as Legalist, judging them to \"present a point of view much closer to that of the realistic Confucian, Xunzi than either the highly idealistic Confucianism of Mencius or the Draconian Legalism advocated by Shang Yang.\" The Guanzi shares with other \"Legalist\" texts the view that power is independent of morality, emphasizing techniques (Shu), but advocates \"law\" (Fa) as an adjunct to Confucian Li.\n\n\n\n"}

Gururaj Ananda Yogi started giving satsang in his living room at his home in South Africa and during 1974 with the help of some of his disciples in South Africa started The South African Meditation Society and The International Foundation for Spiritual Unfoldment. On October 1974 Marguerite Cusley (alias Gita) a teacher from Transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, organized for him a trip to the UK where Gururaj Ananda was introduced to many TM teachers from around the world and who soon joined his movement, The International Foundation for Spiritual Unfoldment (IFSU).\n\nWithin that organization several National Mediation Societies were created that are today continuing teaching meditation in different countries around the world.

However, over the last 22 years since Gururaj physical passing, the organisation headed by Rajesh Ananda and Jasmini Ananda has become the largest and most successful organisation in the world with 80 branches in 13 different countries and they continue to grow at an accelerated pace having strong founded leadership and guruship by promoting Gururaj's teachings. FISU has become one of the world's largest and most active meditation schools and is continually expanding.\n\n"}

The town of Amul at the time was known to be heavily populated by Shi'ite Muslims. At a very young age he started studying Imam Shi'ism and attended the juridical school of \"madhhab\" where he also devoted his time to Sufism, until around the age of thirty. Haydar Amuli first began his studies in his home town of Amul. He eventually moved on to the town of Astarabad, located near Mazandaran, and then Isfahan, located in the centre of Iran.\nIn his early twenties, Sayyid Haydar Amuli returned to Amul and became a trusted confidant and eventually a special deputy and chamberlain to the Bavandid Hasan II, who was the ruler of Tabaristan. Even though Amuli had a close relationship with Hasan II, he experienced a religious crisis. Amuli quotes in his work \"Inner Secrets of the Path\" that he started to feel that he was corrupt and that he needed to move to a place where he could fully devote himself to God. So Haydar Amuli gave up his position in the court to further pursue Sufism. He abandined the courtly life, a couple of years before Hasan II was assassinated by members of his own family.\n\nAfter Haydar Amuli's departure from the court, he began practicing Sufism. Living in the village of Tihran, he began to follow a shaykh by the name of Nur al-Din Tihrani, a gnositc and ascetic of Allah. Amuli spent a little less than a month in his company before going on to wear the symbolic Sufi cloak or khirqa. Eventually, Haydar Amuli went on to embark on a pilgrimage or Hajj, going on to visit various Shi'ite shrines and also traveling to Jerusalem as well as the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Unfortunately, due to ill health, Amuli had to leave Medina\n. It is documented that he spent the rest of his life in Iraq. For several years he studied in Baghdad amongst important Shi'ite scholars including Fakhr al-Din Muhammad al-Hasan and Nasir al-Din al-Kashani al-Hilli. These two scholars were prominent figures in Shi'ism at the time. Haydar al-Amuli then settled in the Shi'ite city of Najaf, south of Baghdad, for over thirty years until around 1385 CE, the year he was last documented to be living. This is also around the same time that he completed his last work, called \"Resalat al-olum al-aliya\".\n\nEarly on Amuli was a supporter of Imamite Shi’ism. Similar to Sufism, Shi’ism involves the ideas of šarīʿa, ṭarīqa and ḥaqīqa. Amuli believed that every Shi’ite was “a believer put to the test”, a central Sufi belief. One of Amuli’s main ideas was that the Imams, who were believed to be endowed with mystical knowledge, were not just guides to the Shi’ite community but also to the Sufi community. Amuli was both a critic of Shi’ites who limited their religion to a set of rules and equally critical of Sufis who denied certain principles that originated with the Imams.\n\nAmuli also implemented and further explained the differences between pure monotheism and the inner aspect. Pure monotheism is constituted by the profession of faith and of the idea of the outward aspect of God’s unity. The inner aspect involves the idea that nothing else exists except for God. Amuli metaphorically explained the idea of the inner and outward aspects as ink and the letters that are produced by that ink. The letters by themselves do not exist without the ink. Amuli meant that the physical world is only a manifestation of God’s divine names.\n\nAnother belief of Amuli related to the arrival of the twelfth Imam, Mahdī. Amuli’s idea of the twelfth Imam follows the ideas of previous scholars. Amuli specifically believed that ‘Ali was the seal of the universal walāya and Mohammadan walāya is, for Amuli, the Mahdī. These ideas differ from that of Ibn ‘Arabi in that al’Arabi believes that Jesus Christ was the seal of the universal walāya.\n\nIt is documented that Sayyid Haydar Amuli wrote over forty different works, but of those only seven remain. In Asrār al-šarīʿa wa aṭwār al-ṭarīqa wa anwār al-ḥaqīqa, Amuli individually discusses his five basic principles of religion: divine unity, prophecy, eschatology, Imamate and justice. He also mentions the five pillars of Islam prayer, including fasting, zakāt, haǰǰ, and ǰehād. He discusses all of these topics from three different points of view, the šarīʿa, the ṭarīqa, and the ḥaqīqa. Jāmeʿ al-asrār wa manbaʿ al-anwār is the most famous of Amuli’s writings. It is divided into three books and each book is separated into four chapters or (qāʿeda). al-Masāʾel al-āmolīya (or al-ḥaydarīya) is a work that consists of theological and juridical ideas that are addressed by Amuli written to his teacher Faḵr-al-moḥaqqeqīn. From this work an autograph is preserved. Amuli wrote, Resālat al-woǰūd fī maʿrefat al-maʿbūd, in 1359 CE. It was completed while Amuli was residing in Naǰaf around 1367 CE. al-Moḥīṭ al-aʿẓam is a seven volume commentary that was completed around 1375 or 1376 CE. This work titled, Naṣṣ al-noṣūṣ is a commentary on another piece written by Ibn Arabi, titled Foṣūṣ al-ḥekam. This piece includes some autobiographical passages that provide information about Amuli’s life. Amuli's last work was titled, Resālat al- ʿolūm al-ʿālīya is a collection of Imamite traditions credited to Amuli. It is often debated that it was actually written by a different author.\n\n\"The ocean is the same ocean as it has been of old; The events of today are its waves and its rivers.\"\n\n\"Indeed I swear by Allah that if the seven heavens were made of paper and the trees of the earth were pens, if the seas of the world were ink and the spirits, mankind and the angels were scribes, then they would be unable to write even a jot of what I had witnessed of the divine gnoses and realities\"\n\nIn Sayyid Haydar Amuli's commentary Al‑Muhit al‑A`zam (The Mighty Ocean, Amuli gives a brief family genealogy.\n\nAmuli is not the only Imamite thinker to incorporate the writings of Ibn ‘Arabi and his followers. The joining of both Sufism and Shi'ism was further explored throughout history by more scholars like Amuli. Scholars such as, Mir Damad, Mulla Sadra, Hadi Sabzavari, and Ayatollah Khomayni continued to establish a connection between Sufism and Shi’ism.Book of Haytdar Amuli: Inner Secrets Of The Path\n\n\n"}

His father was lieutenant of the citadel. After 15 years of childless marriage his mother prayed for a child, which prayers became only more intense with the death of their first born shortly after birth. The town of Liesse-Notre-Dame is situated about northwest of Reims. Liesse-Notre-Dame (Our Lady of Joy) is a center of Marian pilgrimage, and was a favorite shrine of Princess Henrietta Maria of France. On her way to Liesse, in company with her mother, Marie de' Medici, and sister-in-law, Anne of Austria, she happened to pass through La Fère on the day of the infant Boudon's christening. The princess agreed to be the child's godmother and he was baptized Henri-Marie.\n\nNot long after his christening, his parents made a pilgrimage to Liesse, where his mother dedicated the child to Mary, Queen of Angels and invoked her protection of him. His father died shortly thereafter, and his mother soon remarried. At the age of eleven Henri-Marie was sent to attend the Jesuit college at Rouen. Later he studied at the Sorbonne.\n\nHe was ordained in January, 1655. Boudon served as Archdeacon of Evreux and given with the authority of Vicar-General. During his visitations to various ecclesiastical sites, the Archdeacon was particularly dismayed at the deplorable conditions he found in many domestic chapels of the chateaux of the privileged. His criticism was not well-received and made many enemies, as did his efforts to reform a disinterested and self-indulgent clergy. \n\nBoudon was a key figure in the French school of spirituality. A recurring theme in Boudon's work, characteristic of the French school, was the idea that the search for God requires detachment from all creatures. \"God Alone\" was his motto. His book \"Dieu seul: le Saint esclavage de l'admirable Mère de Dieu\", (Only God, the Holy Slavery of the admirable Mother of God) was praised warmly by Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, and was a key influence on Saint Louis de Montfort.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6044416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6044416", "title": "Jan Standonck", "text": "Jan Standonck\n\nJan Standonck (or \"Jean Standonk\"; 16 August 1453 – 5 February 1504) was a Flemish priest, Scholastic, and reformer.\n\nHe was part of the great movement for reform in the 15th-century French church. His approach was to reform the recruitment and education of the clergy, along very ascetic lines, heavily influenced by the hermit saint Francis of Paola. To this end he founded many colleges, all of them strictly controlled and dedicated to poor students with real vocations. Chief amongst them was the Collège de Montaigu, latterly part of the University of Paris. He lived at a time when this model of reform was under increasing pressure from more thoroughgoing critiques—including that of one of his most famous students, Erasmus.\n\nHe was born in Mechelen (at that time part of the Burgundian Netherlands) into extremely humble circumstances, the son of a poor cobbler. He received his early education there but quickly transferred to Gouda, where the Brothers of the Common Life ran a famous school along monastic lines. Here Jan developed his preference for a mystical, as opposed to an intellectual, approach to religion, together with a determinedly ascetic approach to religious life. The education he received from the Brothers was a traditional Medieval one, including Grammar and Logic, conducted during long days, interrupted by religious devotions, and accompanied by frugal meals, cold beds and many punishments. However, the ancient writers were not neglected—Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero and Cato were much studied with a view to producing a good Latin style and many moral messages. But he was warned against the views of these pagan authors, to counterbalance which he studied the Bible and the Church Fathers. In particular, he studied the Devotio Moderna; a mystical approach based on Thomas a Kempis's Imitation of Christ—in particular, imitation of his sufferings. Jan paid for his studies, as many poor boys did, by serving in the kitchen, or attending to richer students, and performing menial tasks, such as ringing the bell. According to the anonymous monk who was his first biographer (1519), he could not afford candles, so he read, after a hard day, high up in the bell tower by the light of the moon. He never managed to develop a good Latin style—it was apparently always rough and full of mistakes—and he knew nothing of the Greek that was kindling the enthusiasm of so many of his contemporaries, but he never lost his love of the severe religious life learned at Gouda.\n\nOn 22 November 1469 he enrolled at Leuven University but seems to have moved on to Paris very soon afterwards. Here he again performed menial services—this time for the monks of Sainte Genevieve—in return for his education. He got his degree in 1475. He was immediately asked to become Regent—that is, student-master—in the Collège de Montaigu, where he also began his (more advanced) studies in Theology. Soon afterwards, he visited a renowned Italian hermit who had been invited to France by the King, Charles VIII. This was St Francis of Paola, who had given up all possessions, (he had walked to France from Italy), including the personal use of money, and subjected himself to severe privations in terms of food, clothing, cleanliness, heat and bedding. Jan was tremendously struck by Francis's air of saintliness.\n\nOn 30 May 1483, he became Master of the Collège de Montaigu, a home for poor students from far away. The College had been founded in 1314 by Gilles Aycelin, in Normandy, France—who was the Archbishop of Rouen from 1311 to 1319). Later that year, he was also made the librarian for the Sorbonne, the famous Theology Faculty of the University of Paris.\n\nThe College was in great disrepair when Jan Standonck took over—some of the walls were falling down. It had become known as the Collège de Montaigu, after the Archbishop's brother, and Jan was to make it famous. He imposed a very severe regime on the students. They could leave only with his permission and had to return before nightfall—he took the key from the porter every night. They wore only a single cloth gown and were given only a piece of bread each day to eat. They had to go to the door of a nearby monastery at eleven o'clock each morning to receive a hand-out of food. They were punished for the slightest fault, and were encouraged—out of pure charity—to inform of any misdemeanours, and to criticise each other's conduct. Erasmus, one of the students, later said he did not think anyone could forget—or even survive unscathed—their time at the College.\n\nOn 16 December 1485, Standonck was elected Rector of the University. The students rose up in violent protest, such was his reputation for severity and strictness. (On 10 April 1490 he made a formal complaint to the authorities that students were not attending his lectures).\n\nIn 1490 he received his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any original contribution to Theology. He just was not interested in this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.\n\nMeanwhile, his reputation for saintliness was growing. He was made a Canon of Beauvais on 11 November 1493. In the following year, he asked the monks of Chartreux to oversee the spiritual welfare of his college, which he had set on a firmer footing, with regular rules, approved by the Chapter of Notre Dame Cathedral. The Admiral of France, Louis Malet de Graville gave him a property which brought in 120 livres a year, which he used for the College. The Admiral also paid for a new building. He got another gift to the same value the following year from Jean de Rochechouart, which he dedicated to the college. When he preached at St Georges at Abbéville during Lent in 1496, the only payment he asked for was some black and grey cloth to clothe his students.\n\nIn 1498, king Manuel I of Portugal complained officially to France for the sale of Portuguese merchandise taken by French corsairs via Admiral Graville. To appease the king, Standonck offered two scholarships for worthy Portuguese students in the college. The king accepted, becoming a benefactor of Collège de Montaigu, sending Diogo de Gouveia to study there in 1499.\n\nHis message of a reformed clergy was in great demand (though he had to call for armed help from the Admiral's men to evict an Augustinian friar from the pulpit at Abbéville). Later that year he tried to bring a heretic to see the error of his ways. Jean Langlois was a priest who had travelled widely—in Spain, Provence, Italy and Bohemia where he had picked up some dangerous ideas. On 3 June 1496 he pushed the priest serving Mass at Notre Dame Cathedral and scattered the Hosts from the chalice before stamping all over them and declaring the idea of the real presence of Christ in them to be a superstition. He was also a brother of one of Standonck's students, so Jan visited him in prison to try to get him to repent, which he did. However, when he learned he was to be handed over to the civil authorities—to be put to death—he retracted his repentance. He was ceremoniously stripped of his priesthood in front of Notre Dame, and the public executioner chopped off the hand that had offensively touched the sacred chalice. He was then put backwards on a donkey and led to the pig market to be burned. Standonck followed him all the way, preaching and imploring him to repent until he was so exhausted he could not speak. Langlois repented just as he was being burned. Standonck declared that from henceforth he would maintain a strict Lenten fast.\n\nThe demands for his services were so much that he had to go for help to the Brothers of the Common Life of Windesheim in the Netherlands, who agreed to send him six priests, led by Jean de Bruxelles, and including an interpreter. These, along with Montaigu graduates, he sent to monasteries and bishops who asked for help in reforming their priests. They would work by setting an example of a strict ascetic life of prayer and devotion. Many monks began to suspect some order of take-over. Still others began resenting the suggestion they did not know how to live a holy life, while still others felt that Standonck's approach was too extreme. He had mixed success, and the Dutch brothers returned home. He won some powerful enemies in several prestigious convents, including St Victor.\n\nOn 27 October 1496, the Chapter of Notre Dame Cathedral ordered all the priests in the diocese to give up any women they were living with. There was violent opposition to this. The following year he got one vote in the election for Archbishop of Rheims and Jan was persuaded to use this as a challenge to the dubious methods used by the winner, the candidate of the King. Charles VIII had died and the new king, Louis XII was crowned by the new archbishop at Rheims Cathedral on 17 December 1498. To consolidate his position, Louis divorced his wife, Jeanne, and married the widow, Queen Anne, of the late King, who had been his nephew. Jan unwisely advised the Queen against the marriage and preached against divorce (except in cases of adultery). Early the following year, he, along with the other Doctors in the University went on strike in protest against what they saw as unlawful interference in their affairs by the King. He was prominent in setting out their case. He also helped one of the more forceful opponents of the divorce escape. The King got his divorce and set about punishing his opponents. Standonck was lucky to get only two years exile. He handed over direction of the College to Noël Béda and John Mair and set off to Cambrai in his native Flanders, where he was welcomed by the Bishop.\n\nHe used the time in exile to continue preaching and he founded schools, based on the rule of the Collège de Montaigu in various towns, including his hometown of Mechlin, Breda and his old University of Leuven. Later he founded one at Beauvais, where he was canon of the Cathedral. In Brussels he preached to the Archduke Philip of Austria and he visited the Brothers at Windesheim and Gouda. Louis XII, under pressure, relented in 1500, signing very fulsome testimonial on 17 April. On 21 August that year, Pope Alexander VI formally agreed to the rules Standonck had set out for his colleges and the following year, he set out to visit new ones at Valenciennes, Leyden and Harlem, as well as re-Mechlin. In 1502, he received one vote for the Bishopric of Paris, but wisely did not follow this up. He tried to convert another heretic, but this time he failed, but he had not lost his typically medieval taste for litigation. In 1503, he took one of the College masters (Jacques Almain) to court for leaving, taking some students with him. They were ordered to return. He later fell ill with a fever, so bad that the doctors insisted he take some meat, which he did. He echoed St Francis of Assis in welcoming the fever bouts with \"Welcome, Sister Fever!\". He recovered a little but had a relapse in early 1504. He died during the night of 4 and 5 February, aged 50, and was immediately buried without ceremony at the door of the chapel, so that people could walk over his grave. The inscription was \"Souvenez-vous du pauvre homme Standonck\"—remember the poor man, Standonck.\n\nThere is no doubting the tremendous influence of Standonck at the time and the college founded was for centuries one of the most prestigious in the world, producing scholars and ardent reformers of all camps, including Béda, John Mair, Erasmus and later Calvin and Loyola. His form of reform—the education of exemplary clergy—was taken over in the Catholic Reformation but was rejected by the more radical reform demanded by Luther, Calvin and Knox, for whom personal mortification rather missed the point. The Catholic reformer Erasmus agreed. His judgement on Jan Standonk was that his intentions were good, but he lacked judgement. Erasmus's own judgement on the Collège de Montaigu was brutal indeed. Others—John Mair, for example—looked back on it with immense gratitude and respect.\n\n"}

She published some twenty research papers along with translations into Polish of three books by Bertrand Russell. The main focus of her writings were on foundational problems related to probability, induction and confirmation. She is noted especially for her exegesis, in her 1940 paper \"On Confirmation,\" of the Raven Paradox which she credits to Carl Hempel. Shot by the Gestapo in 1942, she like many other eminent representatives of Polish logic such as Mojżesz Presburger, shared the fate of millions of Jews murdered on Polish soil by the Nazis.\n\nJanina Hosiasson (Polish: \"Hosiassonóawa\") was born on 6 December 1899 in Warsaw, the daughter of the merchant Josef Hosiasson and his wife Sophia Feigenblat. She was a student of Tadeusz Kotarbinski and Jan Łukasiewicz.at the University of Warsaw.and received her doctorate there under Kotarbinski in 1926 with a dissertation on the \"Justification of Inductive Reasoning\". She then became a secondary school teacher. By the late 1920's she was a respected philosopher of logic of the Lwow-Warsaw school who actively participated in the second Polish Philosophical Congress held in Warsaw in September 1927 and (like her husband-to-be) delivered papers at the First Congress of Mathematicians from Slavic Countries held in Warsaw and Poznań in September 1929. Janina then went, on a scholarship from the Polish Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education, to spend the 1929/30 academic year studying philosophy in Cambridge..\n\nAccording to Zygmunt and Purdy \"in late 1935, or (more likely) sometime in the first 7 or 8 months of 1936\" Janina Hosiasson married mathematician and fellow logician Adolf Lindenbaum. After marriage Janina would use the surname Hosiasson-Lindenbaum. The couple then resided together in Zoliborz. Janina had focused her research primarily on induction and the application of probability theory to inductive logic. Hosiasson-Lindenbaum is listed amongst the speakers at the first Unity of Science Congress in Paris 1935 and is known to have participated in the preliminary meeting for the same in Prague the previous year and to have attended the Second Congress held in Copenhagen in 1936. She had (like Alfred Tarski) also been scheduled to present her research at the Unity of Science Congress at Harvard in September 1939 but, fatefully, was unable to sail in time - she applied for passage on the next boat to America after that taken by Tarski but her visa was denied.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, on 6 September 1939, the couple moved to Vilnius (a city then in Poland - known as Wilno - that was annexed by the Soviet Union) but there separated with Adolf continuing on to Bialystok (it is unknown whether they saw each other after this). On 22 June 22, 1941, Germany declared war on the Soviet Union.Within days, German troops had entered Bialystok and, soon after, Vilnius. Around September, 1941 her husband was arrested in Bialystok.and it is generally thought (again, according to Zygmunt and Purdy) that he was killed by the Nazis that same year. Janina was arrested by the Gestapo and in April, 1942, after 7 months of imprisonment in Vilnius, she was transported to Paneriai, on the outskirts of the city, and shot.\n\n\nJedynak, Anna (2001). \"Janina Hosiasson-Lindenbaum - The Logic of Induction\".

His academic specializations include philosophy, theology and religious studies.\n\nMugambi was born on 6 February 1947 at Kiangoci, Embu District, in the Eastern Province of Kenya. Mugambi's father Timothy Kanyua Mugambi and mother Jemimah Koori were both committed Anglican Christians. His father, whom he describes as a person who was \"ahead of his time,\" was a lay leader, preacher and evangelist.\n\nMugambi also spent much of his childhood with his paternal grandfather Mugambi wa Nthigai, an elder statesman who arbitrated over disputes and provided advice and counsel to many people who came to consult him, and his paternal grandmother Rhoda Wambiro. Mugambi's maternal grandfather was Daniel Njerü wa Kanyenje, who had served in the Carrier Corps in the then Tanganyika during the First World War.\n\nBoth sets of his grandparents were strict adherents of their African cultural and religious heritage. While his parents nurtured him to become a strong Christian, his grandparents nurtured him to cherish the African heritage.\n\nMugambi began his career as a high school teacher and a college tutor. After high school, he enrolled at Machakos Teacher Training College (MTTC), Kenya, in 1966–67. In 1968 he was admitted to Kenyatta College, Nairobi, to pursue further teacher training for a year, specializing in religious education and English at the high school level. He would pursue further studies at Westhill College of Education, Birmingham, UK, and conducted historical research at the CMS Archives in London (1969–70).\n\nIn 1971, Mugambi would attend the University of Nairobi for undergraduate and postgraduate studies.\n\nIn 1978 he embarked on his research for PhD, which he completed in 1983, focusing on Ludwig Wittgenstein entitled \"Problems of Meaning in Discourse with Reference to Religion.\" His main supervisor was Professor Joseph Donders, with helpful advice from Professor Kwasi Wiredu, who was then in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ghana, Legon. During this period he was invited to participate in an ecumenical research project to document the practice of ecumenism at the local level in eastern Africa. This research was published in 1982 as \"Ecumenical Initiatives in Eastern Africa\".\n\nAfter graduation from the University of Nairobi, Mugambi would become active in the ecumenical movement. In 1970, when he participated in the formation and launch of the Christian Student Council (the Kenyan SCM) and in the National Association of Religious Education Teachers (NARET). These involvements brought him into acquaintance with other ecumenists. He would later serve as Africa Theology Secretary for the World Student Christian Federation (1974–76), and remained a resource person in various ecumenical organizations at local, national, regional, continental and global levels. He would also hold various posts in the World Council of Churches from 1975 until today.\n\nMugambi joined the academic staff of the University of Nairobi in 1976, and rose through the ranks to full professorship in 1993. He has taught philosophy of religion; Religion and Science; Comparative Study of Religions; Contemporary Religious Thought; Modern Trends in Christian Thought. He has also taught African Christian Theology. Later on he began teaching Phenomenology of Religion in the postgraduate syllabus.\n\nMugambi has had a number of visiting professorships internationally.\n\nHe is a fellow of the Kenya National Academy of Sciences (FKNAS) and was conferred a national honour as an Edler of the Order of the Burning Spear (EBS) in 2010.\n\nEarly in 1990 he became widely acclaimed in Christian theological circles after he addressed the General Committee of the All Africa Conference of Churches on March 30 in Nairobi, reflecting on \"The Future of the Church and the Church of the Future in Africa.\" This event was a few weeks after Nelson Mandela had been released on 11 February 1990 and Namibia had attained national independence on 21 March of the same year. In his address, Mugambi suggested that African Christianity must shift theological gear from the paradigm of liberation, which emphasised the Exodus motif, to that of reconstruction, which emphasises the post-Exilic motif. He later elaborated this insight in his book \"From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War\".\n\nHis doctoral thesis, completed in 1984 at the University of Nairobi, was on Ludwig Wittgenstein, focusing on problems of meaning in discourse with reference to religion. His professional training is in education, communication and university management. His honorary service has been mainly the ecumenical movement at the local, national, regional, continental and global levels.\n\nMugambi is Africa Co-Editor of \"Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity\", in which he has contributed more than ten articles, mainly on hermeneutics. His doctoral research on Ludwig Wittgenstein anchored him into hermeneutical thinking. Wittgenstein observed that philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language. Hermeneutics deals with principles of interpretation. Within the context of Christian Theology, most doctrinal conflicts are the result of misunderstandings about biblical texts, historical claims and cultural assumptions.\n\nIn 1998, Mugambi observed that the time was overdue for African Christian theologians to engage in theological introspection, transcending ecclesiological description and theological anthropology. He cited Bernard Lonergan as a possible role model in that approach. Professor Knut Holter of the School of Theology in Stavanger, Norway facilitated in Nairobi a continental Conference of African Old Testament scholars, which Mugambi was invited to address. The topic of his paper was \"Africa and the Old Testament\", published in 2000. The Society for New Testament Studies (SNTS) held its Annual Conference for 1999 at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Following that Conference some African Christian theologians were invited to present papers on Hermeneutics at a meeting in Hammanskraal, near Pretoria. Mugambi delivered the Keynote Address titled \"Foundations for an African Approach to Biblical Hermeneutics\", which was published in 2001. Among the respondents to his address were Professor Hans-Dieter Betz (University of Chicago); Professor Peder Borgen (University of Trondheim) and Professor Vernon Robbins (Emory University). The Report of this \"Unique Conference\" was written and presented by Professor Bernard Lategan (Stellenbosch University).\n\nIn 2004 Mugambi co-edited a book on New Testament Hermeneutics, to which he contributed a Chapter. The following year a conference was held at Makerere University, which Mugambi was invited to address. His paper was \"African Hermeneutics in a Global Context\", published in 2007 as a Chapter in Interpreting Classical Religious Texts in Contemporary Africa, edited by Knut Holter. There is much hermeneutical discourse in Mugambis book (co-authored with Michael R. Guy) titled Contextual Theology Across Cultures, published in 2009.\n\nMugambi is critical of Rudolf Bultmann's project of \"demythologisation\", on the ground that hermeneutically, myth cannot be abstracted from the Gospel. Any attempt at 'demythologization' results in new myths. Instead of \"demythologization\", Mugambi urges for \"remythologization.\" He says of Bultmann, \"in (his) attempt to satisfy scientific positivism by denouncing myth (he) ends up destroying the reality of religion as a pillar of culture.\" For Mugambi, as with Jaspers, \"myth is indispensable in cultural constructions of reality.\" To Mugambi, therefore, reconstruction in Africa has to be anchored in a) the formulation of new myths to replace the negative stereotypes used for the indoctrination of Africans under imperialism and missionary tutelage, and b) re-interpreting the old myths, for the survival of the African peoples. He suggests that the myth of \"a vanishing people must be replaced by the myth of a resurgent, or resilient people,\" while the myth of a \"desperate people must be replaced by the myth of a people (who are) full of hope. The myth of a hungry people must be replaced by the myth of a people capable of feeding themselves, and so on.\"\n\nIn 1989 Mugambi published his book The Biblical Basis for Evangelization. This was in same year that he facilitated the editing and publication of a collection of essays on this theme – Christian Mission and Social Transformation. This book was published in the context of the Mission Conference convened by the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) in commemoration of the seventieth anniversary of the Kikuyu Conference of 1918 which launched ecumenical cooperation in Kenya. In 1996 he published an Article titled \"African Churches in Social Transformation\" in the Journal International Affairs at Columbia University, New York. This article was followed by another titled \"Vision of African Church in Mission\", published in Missionalia, Journal of the Southern African Missiological Society.\n\nIn 1998 he published Missiological Research in the Context of Globalization in \"Missiological Research in the Context of Globalization\", in Swedish Missiological Themes, Uppsala. He also published \"A Fresh Look at Evangelism in Africa\" in International Review of Mission, Geneva. In the same year he published \"Christian Mission and Social Transformation After the Cold War\" in the Journal of Constructive Theology, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. At the request of Bishop John V. Taylor in 2001, Mugambi wrote a critical Introduction published in the second edition of Taylor's book, \"The Primal Vision\" (SCM Press), also published in Nairobi as \"Christian Presence amid African Religion\".\n\nDuring a conference organized by the World Council of Churches Sub-Unit of Church and Society in July 1986 at Potsdam, East Germany, Mugambi presented a position paper titled \"God, Humanity and Nature in Ecumenical Discussion\" cautioning against too sharp a distinction between these three notions in Christian doctrine. In 1987 he published his book \"God, Humanity and Nature in Relation to Justice and Peace\". He intended this book to be a contribution to discussions within the World Council of Churches concerning the relationship between Religion and Culture on the one hand, and God and Nature on the other. This publication was an echo of a public forum which Mugambi had organized as an undergraduate at the University of Nairobi in 1972, with Professor Stephen Neill as Patron, on the theme \"Creation or Evolution: God or Darwin\". The theme of Ecology became one of his research interests, and in 2001 he facilitated the editing and publication of \"Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility\". His contribution in that book was a Chapter highly critical of Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading, which was being pushed for adoption within the Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nIn 1997 he published his reflections on \"Some Lessons from a Century of Ecumenism in Africa.\" In 2004 he co-authored with Gaim Kebreab a reference book titled \"Fresh Water to Eradicate Poverty\", released in Oslo by Norwegian Church Aid. The World Council of Churches has Observer status in the United Nations. The Twelfth UNFCCC Conference of Parties was convened at Nairobi, Kenya, in December 2006. Mugambi served as honorary Moderator of the Ecumenical Team as a member of the WCC Delegation. The ecumenical viewpoint was widely publicized in the print and electronic media. Mugambi read the WCC Statement at COP 12 in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2008 Mugambi was invited to participate in an ecumenical Consultation to discuss the theme \"Peace on Earth and Peace with the Earth\". He presented a paper titled \"The Environmental Crisis from an African Perspective.\" He also published an Article titled \"The Environmental Crisis from a Christian Perspective.\" During the Fifteenth UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP 15) at Copenhagen in December 2009 Mugambi as a member of the WCC Delegation participated in a Seminar arranged by Dan Church Aid and hosted by the Faculty of Theology at Copenhagen University. The Title of his presentation was \"Adaptation to Climate Change in Tropical Africa\".\n\nMugambi emphasizes that our survival as human beings across generations will depend on how we manage our ecology – the flora and fauna in all the habitats where human beings have their abode. The availability of fresh water determines the habitability of an environment. Most of the land on the continent of Africa has arable soils, but freshwater is very unevenly distributed. Fresh water can be obtained from rivers, fresh-water lakes and underground aquifers. The most cost-effective source of fresh water is rainwater harvesting. In his book Fresh Water to Eradicate Poverty he observes that Africa has the largest quantity of stable rainwater runoff, which may be harvested season after season, accumulating huge quantities to be used for agricultural, domestic and industrial applications. Rainwater harvesting can also help to recharge the rivers, lakes and underground aquifers. As a practicing ecologist, Professor Mugambi is a trustee of the Kenya Rainwater Association and the Utooni Development organization. He is also a member of the Ecumenical Water Network and the World Council of Churches Working Group on Climate Change. As a result of Global Warming there are unpredictable extremes every season in all regions, making survival difficult for communities that depend on seasonal rains for agriculture and staple food. The droughts are longer and more severe. The rains when they come are heavier and for shorter periods, making it difficult for crops to grow to maturity. The regularity of the seasons can no longer be taken for granted. Rehabilitation of local environments is a necessity rather than a luxury for all regions. Jesse Mugambi has worked with communities in various African countries to promote awareness about the global ecological crisis.\n\nMugambi suggests that inter-religious dialogue has broader implications than arguments about beliefs and practices within and between religions. Believers of particular religions, denominations and sects are at the same time citizens of particular nations. Thus religious identity and secular identity are practical necessity, irrespective of idealistic and utopian expectations. During and after the European Reformation the rulers of specific nations interpreted religious non-conformism as subversion, while conformism facilitated the establishment of national churches that remain a legacy of European nationalism till the twenty-first century. In his view, inter-religious dialogue can be one of the means to promote mutual understanding within and between religions, cultures and nations, provided that such dialogue presupposes mutual respect and mutual reciprocity.\n\nAccording to Rosberg and Nottingham about 75,000 Kenyans served in the British military during the Second World War. Some went to Asia (mainly Ceylon, India and Burma), including Mugambi's father. The struggle for national sovereignty in India was towards its end as the Kenyan veterans were returning home. Their conscription into the war had been justified with the argument that Britain was fighting against tyranny in order to preserve democracy and freedom, which these veterans and the people they left at home did not enjoy. Upon their return, much more exposed and more self-confident than the peers who had not gone to war, these veterans led the campaign for national independence. The campaign was peaceful at the beginning, but the British administrators and settlers were adamant that Kenya would remain British for ever. The veterans found no justification for colonial domination with its attendant alienation of ancestral lands by British settlers, economic exploitation, forced labour, taxation without representation, restriction of movement in their own country, racial segregation, denial of access to basic social services including schooling and medical care.\n\nThe British missionaries, settlers, administrators and entrepreneurs enjoyed full imperial citizenship, while Kenyans remained imperial subjects in their motherland. Mugambi started schooling as an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) in a concentration camp. Collective punishment was the fate of all the people of Central Kenya, young and old, men and women, disabled and able-bodied, healthy and sick, guilty and innocent. They were all locked up in concentration camps under strict curfew orders the cost of breach of which was death. The experience was traumatic, as described by Caroline Elkins, David Anderson and others. Despite all odds, Mugambi managed to proceed with school work and to pass all his examinations without having to repeat any year. His articulation of Liberation Theology in later years was anchored in his personal experience of imperial domination and colonial oppression. In 1989 he published a book containing his theological reflections under the title African Christian Theology: An Introduction. Nelson Mandela in 1953 had aptly expressed the plight of Kenyans and the responsibility of Britain for their suffering, which he related with the situation in South Africa at the time:\n\nThe massacre of the Kenyan people by Britain has aroused worldwide indignation and protest. Children are being burnt alive; women are raped, tortured, whipped and boiling water poured on their breasts to force confessions from them that Jomo Kenyatta had administered the Mau Mau oath to them. Men are being castrated and shot dead. In the Kikuyu country, the population has been completely wiped out in some villages ... We are prisoners in our own country because we dared to raise our voices against those horrible atrocities and because we expressed our solidarity with the cause of the Kenyan people. You can see that there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintops of our desires.\n\nIn his 1974 essay on liberation and salvation, Mugambi had clarified that within the African context of the 1960s and 1970s liberation (from oppression, exploitation and racial prejudice) was the main preoccupation for al responsible leaders.\n\nThat the fundamental concern of African Christian theology has been liberation-salvation has been manifested in the activities of many African Christians and the growth of more than six thousand \"Independent\" churches in the continent of Africa. Most African Christians have not felt it necessary to theorize about Christian Theology, because to them religious faith is practical living, expressed most effectively through experience, not through words. The time has come when it is necessary to analyze the premises of African Christian experience and study it in relation to that of peoples in other parts of the world. This systematic analysis and study, however, will be realistic and relevant as African Christian theology if Africans themselves will be the analysts and students of their own experience ... What is important to point out in this context is that while liberation both as a concept and as a historical struggle in Africa today takes on different emphasis in different parts of Africa, it must be the overarching goal – the historical project— out of which and for which an African Christian theology must emerge.\n\nIn Mugambi's scholarly work liberation precedes reconstruction in African Christian Theological reflection.\n\nThroughout his studies and in his research and writing, Mugambi has interacted with a wide range of scholars from the North Atlantic, Asia and Latin America. Mugambi resonates with Karl Jaspers' positive appraisal of myth in the conceptualization of world-views. A myth tells a story and expresses intuitive insights, rather than universal concepts. Thus Mugambi proposes that, \"a society which is incapable of making its own myths and re-interpreting its old ones, becomes extinct.\" In view of this insight, Mugambi defines the vision of the theology of reconstruction, in Africa, as a project of \"... re-mythologization, in which the theologian thus engaged, discerns new symbols and new metaphors in which to recast the central Message of the Gospel.\"\n\nMugambi joins other scholars in African Christian Theology, endeavouring to authentically relate Christianity with the African cultural and religious heritage with appreciation of both the Gospel and the wisdom bequeathed from generation to generation through oral tradition, cherished customs, rituals and symbols. It appears that Mugambi's concern for Pan-African identity has support within diplomatic circles. Even though he does not treat Africa as a single geo-cultural context of theology, he nevertheless creates in his readers an impression that African concerns are broadly the same – which is largely correct. He is particularly appealing because he strictly and consistently avoids any attempt at parochial, national and regional introversion, opting for an approach that keeps in full view the entire continent of Africa with all its homogeneity and heterogeneity.\n\nDespite the risk of appearing too general in his books, Mugambi avoids using such particularistic titles as \"South African Christianity,\" \"Kenyan Christianity,\" \"Africa North (or South) of Limpopo,\" \"East African Christianity\", etc. Rather, he is concerned with the Africans – both in the African continent and in the Diaspora. While Mugambi acknowledges that theological articulation is strictly contextual and situational, all his works take \"Africa\" as the \"Context\" rather than the artificial territorial identities that are the result of the Partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference of 1884–85.\n\nMugambi's book \"From Liberation to Reconstruction\" assesses events that affected Africa as a whole. These events include the end of the Cold War (1989), which divided African countries between those who were pro-West versus the pro-East - thereby causing unnecessary tensions among some neighbouring African countries. Other events include the release of Nelson Rholihlahla Mandela on 11 February 1990 after serving in prison for 27 years on Robben Island. For Mugambi, Mandela is not only the longest-serving political prisoner; he is also the most prominent symbol of the Exodus metaphor in African Christian Theology.\n\nIn his post-Cold-War theological discourses, which can also be regarded as his post- liberation works, Mugambi suggests that the Africa of the 21st century will have to pre-occupy itself with the agenda of reconstruction as the new priority for Africa. The text of Ezra-Nehemiah, unlike that of the Exodus, has to be the main text in the explication of African theological discourses in the 21st century. This text will motivate the people of Africa to rebuild their continent from all sorts of ruins.\n\nReconstruction is the new priority for African nations in the 1990s (and beyond). The churches and their theologians will need to respond to this new priority in relevant fashion, to facilitate this process of reconstruction. The process will require considerable efforts of reconciliation and confidence-building. It will also require re-orientation and retraining.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Mugambi has \"correctly observed that an epiphany of a new scenario has emerged, ushered in by the demise of three horrendous systems of oppression; namely institutionalised racism, brutal colonialism and the cold war tutelage,\" Ukachukwu Chris Manus considers Mugambi as having failed to recognise the central figure in the New Testament, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ himself as the Master Reconstructor of both the spiritual and the social well-being of the bnaiya Israel, the simple folk of his day in first century Palestine.\"\n\nManus goes on to argue that the term \"reconstruction\" makes a deep impression on him as a \"meta-language\" that challenges African religiosity to discern and promote new insights that can inspire a new movement that would help to galvanise Africans in the continent like those in the Diaspora to struggle and regain their integrity. For Manus, therefore, the goal of reconstruction ought to be pursued in order to re-capture Africa's self-esteem, dignity and integrity, \"in the context of new Information and Communication Technology.\"\n\nOthers have offered perspectives on Mugambi's views on liberation and reconstruction. In attempting a definition, the late Hannah Wangeci Kinoti explained that the idea of reconstruction assumes that there is a framework which was previously there. She went on to say that \"a cluster of words associated with the verb reconstruct should quicken our vision of asking the Church in African to rise up and do more, purposefully and decisively.\" She suggested that the concept of reconstruction implies a process of \"review and then move\" - to create something more suitable to the prevailing environment. Other terms can be invoked: rebuild, reassemble, re-establish, recreate, reform, renovate, regenerate, remake, remodel, restore, or re-organise.\n\nA full listing of publications can be found on Mugambi's institutional website.\n\n\nA festschrift for Mugambi was published in 2012: \n\n"}

He served as State Minister for Culture of the Federal Republic of Germany under Chancellor Schröder. Currently, he is Professor of Philosophy and Political Theory at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\n\nNida-Rümelin studied Philosophy, Physics, Mathematics and Political Sciences. In 1984, he completed his PhD in Philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he obtained an assistant professorship, first at the Department of Philosophy and later at the Department of Political Sciences. In 1989, he was conferred the \"Habilitation\" (German post-doctoral qualification) from the Philosophy Department of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. After a one-year visiting professorship at Minnesota State University, he was appointed Chair of the Center for Ethics in the Bio Sciences at Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen. From 1993 to 2003, he held a Chair of Philosophy at the University of Göttingen, before he became Chair of Political Theory and Philosophy at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Since 2009, he is Chair of Philosophy and Political Theory at the Department of Philosophy. He served as Dean of the Philosophy Faculty from 2009 until 2012 and as Deputy Dean thereafter. From 2011 until 2016, he was Speaker of the Munich Center for Ethics.\n\nCurrently, he is Speaker of the executive study program \"Philosophy, Politics, and Ethics\" (PPE) and member of board of the Parmenides Foundation that is dedicated to fostering multi-disciplinary research on thinking at the interface of the natural sciences and humanities. He consults executives and senior managers in ethical questions due to his expertise on risk ethics and philosophy of economics, as revealed by his guiding position on the panel \"Finance and Ethics\" of the German Association of Financial Analyst and Asset Managers (DFAV e.V.) and his membership of the advisory board \"Intregity and Corporate Responsibility\" at Daimler AG.\n\nNida-Rümelin spent five years (1998-2002) in politics. First as Head of the Municipal Department of Arts & Culture of the Bavarian state capital Munich. Then he held a ministerial office as the State Minister for Culture and Media and was thus a member of the national government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. During his time in office, Nida-Rümelin voiced criticism on the implementation of the Bologna Process, the European reformation process of the higher education. He recently criticized German policies aiming to increase the tertiary education rates and recommended instead to further foster German \"dual system\" of vocational training. His book \"How the rush to universities is leading to a crisis of professional and academic education\" stimulated a nationwide debate on education policy.\n\nNida-Rümelin publishes inside and outside of academia. His non-academic articles are regularly published in major German and European newspaper such as Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Zeit, Le Monde, La Repubblica on a range of topics including Europe, economics and ethics, as well as the digitalisation of our society. The article \"The Case for a Change of Course in European Policy\", co-authored with Peter Bofinger and Jürgen Habermas, was translated and published in 12 languages.\n\nNida-Rümelin propounds an approach to practical philosophy based on his theory of “Structural Rationality.” As an alternative to consequentialism, it avoids the dichotomy between moral and extra-moral rationality that is typical in Kantian approaches, and is thus able to integrate a vast complexity of practical reasons that result in coherent practice. Whereas for Kant, rule orientation is constitutive for moral agency, the structural account of rationality extends to the more general idea that rationality consists in embedding situated or point-wise optimization within the broader structure of agency. The intimate connection between morality and rationality that Kant postulates becomes one aspect of the broader, all-encompassing account of acting in such a way that fits into a desirable structure of agency. The practice of giving and taking reasons is understood as aiming at both interpersonal and intrapersonal structural coherence. In this way, the account of structural rationality avoids the dichotomy of reasons - moral versus extra-moral - and allows us to make use of the conceptual frame of decision and game theory in order to clarify some essential aspects of practical coherence. For example, the postulates of the von Neumann/Morgenstern utility theorem are now interpreted as rules of practical coherence and not as axioms of consequentialist optimization. The utility function becomes a mere representation of coherent preferences and expected utility maximization can no longer be interpreted as optimizing the consequences of one's actions. The term “utility” is misleading and should be replaced by “subjective valuation.” The deontological character of structural rationality is compatible with using the conceptual framework of decision theory. This may come as a surprise, but is only due to a logically stringent interpretation of the utility theorem and other theorems of decision and game theory. The usual economic interpretation is only one among many others and in fact, this interpretation is incompatible with most of the practical reasons that we take to be indispensable. The structural account of rationality is embedded in the everyday practice of giving and taking reasons.\n\nDrawing on these considerations, Nida-Rümelin deals with the relationship between philosophy and \"Lebenswelt\" (life-world)/ \"Lebensform\" (form of life). His position is inspired by Wittgenstein's philosophy. In contrary to Wittgenstein, Nida-Rümelin emphasizes the unity of practice, viz. the unity of the person (the agent) and societal interactions. Individuals strive for coherence regarding their beliefs, epistemic attitudes, actions and emotive attitudes. Taking this as a starting point any incoherences can be criticized and are the impetus for philosophy in general, and for ethical theory more specifically. Philosophical theory has to be careful not to leave the common ground of the human practice of giving and taking reasons. It cannot reinvent reasons; it cannot postulate some principles and deduce moral duties from them. Ethical principles can only be systematizations of a given practice of reasoning. Nida-Rümelin takes the side of pragmatism in its conflict against rationalism.\n\nHis theory is characterized as humanism that starts from the \"conditio humana\", i.e. the common elements of the human condition over time and between cultures. Humanism has both an anthropological and an ethical dimension. The anthropological dimension is presented in core normative concepts like (structural) rationality, freedom and responsibility. Humanists think that the ability to act and believe and feel based on reasons is essential in order to understand the human condition. This does not however directly imply humanistic ethics. Human agency requires the ability to weigh reasons and act upon the result of weighing reasons, but it does not ensure morally acceptable agency. Even an officer in a Nazi concentration camp may act by weighing reasons. Humanistic ethics must discriminate between good and bad reasons, good and bad forms of reasoning, good and bad forms of emotive attitudes. Hating somebody because he lives a different life is irrational, as seen in the hatred of homosexuals in a majority heterosexual community, or hatred based on skin colour. The structural account of rationality is optimistic insofar as it assumes that clarifying reasons that strive towardsat intra- and interpersonally coherent agency and belief allow the elimination of bad, misleading reasons of all the three kinds mentioned above (practical, theoretical, and emotive reasons). Therefore, the relationship between anthropological humanism and ethical humanism is not deductive, but pragmatic. Those who take anthropological humanism seriously tend to embrace a humanistic ethos and those who reject humanistic principles of agency tend to fight against anthropological humanism, expressed in different forms: social Darwinism, racism, reductionist naturalism, chauvinist nationalism, discriminating sexism and other forms of anti-humanism. Since communication plays a central role in this form of humanism, Nida-Rümelin presented an account of humanistic semantics.\n\nNida-Rümelin defends a basic, non-ontological, non-metaphysical realism against instrumentalism in the philosophy of science, positivism, and post-modernism in practical philosophy, the humanities and the social sciences. Realism is not a metaphysical postulate but it is part of our everyday practice of giving and taking reasons (form of life). This practice requires facts that individuals find by developing arguments for and against certain hypotheses. Realism is part of our way of life and this makes it implausible to assume that the sciences and humanities can be understood in an anti-realist manner, as is assumed by instrumentalists, constructivists and post-modernists. It is the continuity between everyday life (form of life) and science that speaks in favor the existence of facts. They are not constituted by beliefs, neither by the beliefs of an individual (solipsism), nor by the beliefs of collectives (cultures) or even ideal discourse communities as seen in the work of Jürgen Habermas, or in Hilary Putnam's so-called internal realism, which is in fact a version of idealism.\n\nNaturalism is the dominant metaphysical attitude in the natural sciences as well as in a good part of the social sciences and even in the humanities (sometimes seen in a combination of post-modernism and naturalism). Nida-Rümelin shows that this implicit or explicit naturalism cannot be maintained. The impetus behind most of his arguments against naturalism is pragmatist: he takes the constituency of human agency as given and tries to show that these constituents are incompatible with naturalism. There is no plausible naturalistic interpretation of reason, freedom, and responsibility. Nida-Rümelin first presented his arguments in a trilogy of books: the first about practical reason (2001), the second about freedom (2005), and the third about responsibility (2011). Practical reason, epistemic and practical freedom, epistemic, practical and emotive responsibility are interpreted as three aspects of the same phenomenon: being affected by reasons. This does not mean that the chain of reasoning does not come to an end. On the contrary, here again Nida-Rümelin is close to Wittgenstein in claiming that all reasoning ends in the indisputable elements of our shared form of life. It is irrational to doubt everything, or as Wittgenstein claims, there are some things that a sensible human man will not doubt. Moreover, reasoning is relevant for actions. To doubt it would mean that human beings can transcend their human condition. As Peter Strawson argued in an influential article 'Freedom and Resentment,' being reasonable means that individuals do not exclusively depend on factors beyond their control. What individuals think to be right is relevant for what they do. There cannot be any form of naturalistic determination that excludes reasoning itself. Nida-Rümelin takes the argument against the reduction of logics to psychology (Frege, Husserl) as an argument in favor of the gradual autonomy of reason. In being able to reason logically, individuals follows logical laws that cannot be identified with psychological or neurophysiological data. Additionally, Nida-Rümelin takes the insights of Alonzo Church and Kurt Gödel from the 1930s regarding non-computability showing that reasoning cannot be exclusively algorithmic. As a naturalist position takes causal processes to be algorithmic, reasoning cannot be naturalized. Humanism in Nida-Rümelin's sense therefore excludes deductionist naturalism.\n\n"}

Yet \"continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws. He then hung his gold crown on a crucifix, and never wore it again \"to the honour of God the almighty King\".\n\nLater historians repeated the story, most of them adjusting it to have Canute more clearly aware that the tides would not obey him, and staging the scene to rebuke the flattery of his courtiers.\nThere are also earlier parallels in Celtic stories of men who commanded the tides, namely Saint Illtud of Glamorgan, Maelgwn, king of Gwynedd, and Tuirbe, of Tuirbe's Strand in Brittany.\n\nProverbial reference to the legend in modern journalism or politics usually casts the story in terms of \"Canute's arrogance\" of \"attempting to stop the tide\". \nIt was cited, for example, by Stacy Head as typifying the New Orleans city council's response to Hurricane Katrina (2005), or by Mark Stephens in reference to Ryan Giggs as \"the King Canute of football\" for his attempts of stopping \"the unstoppable tide of information\" on the internet in the 2011 British privacy injunctions controversy. That is a misrepresentation of Huntingdon's account, whose Canute uses the tide to demonstrate his inability to control the elements and his deference to the greater authority of God.\n\nTheodore Dalrymple refers to the story, without misattributing motives of arrogance to Canute, in the context of the British reaction to the Ukraine crisis (2014), saying \nWarren Burger, the Chief Justice of the United States, mentions Canute in the 1980 decision \"Diamond v. Chakrabarty\" (447 U.S. 303), stating the denial of a patent for a micro-organism \"is not likely to put an end to genetic research\". Burger likens doing so to Canute commanding the tides.\n\nThe contemporary \"Encomium Emmae\" has no mention of the episode, which has been taken as indicating its ahistoricity, as it would seem that so pious a dedication might have been recorded there, since the same source gives an \"eye-witness account of his lavish gifts to the monasteries and poor of St Omer when on the way to Rome, and of the tears and breast-beating which accompanied them\". \nGoscelin, writing later in the 11th century, instead has Canute place his crown on a crucifix at Winchester one Easter, with no mention of the sea, and \"with the explanation that the king of kings was more worthy of it than he\". Nevertheless, there may be a \"basis of fact, in a planned act of piety\" behind this story. \nOn the other hand, Malcolm Godden says the story is simply \"a 12th Century legend... and those 12th Century historians were always making up stories about kings from Anglo-Saxon times\".\n\nThe site of the episode is often identified as Thorney Island (now known as Westminster), where Canute set up a royal palace during his reign over London. \nConflictingly, a sign on Southampton city centre's Canute Road reads, \"Near this spot AD 1028 Canute reproved his courtiers\". Bosham in West Sussex also claims to be the site of this episode, as does Gainsborough in Lincolnshire.

{"id": "40322215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40322215", "title": "Lacanianism", "text": "Lacanianism\n\nLacanianism is the study of, and development of, the ideas and theories of the dissident French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Beginning as a commentary on the writings of Freud, Lacanianism developed into a new psychoanalytic theory of humankind, and spawned a worldwide movement of its own.\n\nIt has been argued that \n\nLacanianism began as a philosophical/linguistic re-interpretation of Freud's original teachings. How far it subsequently became an independent body of thought has been, and remains, a matter of debate—Lacan himself famously informing his followers: \n\nThe wide extent of Lacan's evolving intellectual stances, and his inability to find a settled institutional framework for his work, has meant that over time the Lacanian movement has been subject to numerous schisms and continuing divisions.\n\nLacan considered the human psyche to be framed within the three orders of The Imaginary, The Symbolic and The Real (RSI). The three divisions in their varying emphases also correspond roughly to the development of Lacan's thought. As he himself put it in Seminar XXII, \"I began with the Imaginary, I then had to chew on the story of the Symbolic...and I finished by putting out for you this famous Real\".\n\nLacan's early psychoanalytic contributions centered on the questions of image, identification and unconscious fantasy. Developing Henri Wallon's concept of infant mirroring, he used the idea of the mirror stage to demonstrate the imaginary nature of the ego, in opposition to the views of ego psychology.\n\nIn the fifties, the focus of Lacan's interest shifted to the symbolic order of kinship, culture, social structure and roles—all mediated by the acquisition of language—into which each one of us is born and with which we all have to come to terms.\n\nThe focus of therapy became that of dealing with disruptions on the part of the Imaginary of the structuring role played by the signifier/Other/Symbolic Order.\n\nThe sixties saw Lacan's attention increasingly focused on what he termed the Real—not external consensual reality, but rather that unconscious element in the personality, linked to trauma, dream and the drive, which resists signification.\n\nThe Real was what was lacking or absent from every totalising structural theory; and in the form of jouissance, and the persistence of the symptom or synthome, marked Lacan's shifting of psychoanalysis from modernity to postmodernity.\n\nLiterary critic Frederick Crews writes that when Deleuze and Guattari \"indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder\" and \"pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society\" in \"Anti-Oedipus\", their \"demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable\" and \"devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris.\"\n\nLacan's thinking was intimately geared not only to the work of Freud but to that of the most prominent of his psychoanalytic successors—Heinz Hartmann, Melanie Klein, Michael Balint, D. W. Winnicott and more. With Lacan's break with official psychoanalysis in 1963–1964, however, a tendency developed to look for a pure, self-contained Lacanianism, without psychoanalytic trappings. Jacques-Alain Miller's index to \"Ecrits\" had already written of \"the Lacanian epistemology...the analytic experience (in its Lacanian definition...)\"; and where the old guard of first-generation disciples like Serge Leclaire continued to stress the importance of the re-reading of Freud, the new recruits of the sixties and seventies favoured instead an ahistorical Lacan, systematised after the event into a rigorous if over-simplified theoretical whole.\n\nThree main phases may be identified in Lacan's mature work: his Fifties exploration of the Imaginary and the Symbolic; his concern with the Real and the lost object of desire, the objet petit a, during the Sixties; and a final phase highlighting jouissance and the mathematical formulation of psychoanalytic teaching.\n\nAs the fifties Lacan developed a distinctive style of teaching based on a linguistic reading of Freud, so too he built up a substantial following within the Société Française de Psychanalyse [SFP], with Serge Leclaire only the first of many French \"Lacanians\". It was this phase of his teaching that was memorialised in \"Écrits\", and which first found its way into the English-speaking world, where more Lacanians were thus to be found in English or Philosophy Departments than in clinical practice.\n\nHowever the very extent of Lacan's following raised serious criticisms: he was accused both of abusing the positive transference to tie his analysands to himself, and of magnifying their numbers by the use of shortened analytic sessions. The questionable nature of his following was one of the reasons for his failure to gain recognition for his teaching from the IPA recognition for the French form of Freudianism that was \"Lacanianism\"—a failure that led to his founding the École Freudienne de Paris (EFP) in 1964. Many of his closest and most creative followers, such as Jean Laplanche, chose the IPA over Lacan at this point, in the first of many subsequent Lacanian schisms.\n\nLacan's 1973 \"Letter to the Italians\", nominated Muriel Drazien, Giacomo Contri and Armando Verdiglione to carry his teaching in Italy.\n\nAs a body of thought, Lacanianism began to make its way into the English-speaking world from the sixties onwards, influencing film theory, feminist thought, and psychoanalytic criticism, as well as politics and social sciences, primarily through the concepts of the Imaginary and the Symbolic. As the role of the real and of jouissance in opposing structure became more widely recognised, however, so too Lacanianism developed as a tool for the exploration of the divided subject of postmodernity.\n\nSince Lacan's death, however, much of the public attention focused on his work began to decline. Lacan had always been criticised for an obscurantist writing style; and many of his disciples simply replicated the mystificatory elements in his work (in a sort of transferential identification) without his freshness.\n\nWhere interest in Lacanianism did revive in the 21st century, it was in large part the work of figures like Slavoj Žižek who have been able to \"use\" Lacan's thought for their own intellectual ends, without the sometimes stifling orthodoxy of many of the formal Lacanian traditions. The continued influence of Lacanianism is thus paradoxically strongest in those who seem to have embraced Malcolm Bowie's recommendation: \"learn to unlearn the Lacanian idiom in the way Lacan unlearns the Freudian idiom\".\n\nÉlisabeth Roudinesco has suggested that, after the founding of the EFP “the history of psychoanalysis in France became subordinate to that of Lacanianism...the Lacanian movement occupied thereafter the motor position in relation to which the other movements were obliged to determine their course'”. There was certainly a large expansion in the numbers of the school, if arguably at the expense of quantity over quality, as a flood of psychologists submerged the analysts who had come with him from the SFP. Protests against the new regime reached a head with the introduction of the self-certifying 'passe' to analytic status, and old comrades such as François Perrier broke away in the bitter schism of 1968 to found the Quatrieme Groupe.\n\nHowever, major divisions remained within the EDF underwent another painful split over the question of analytic qualifications. There remained within the movement a broad division between the old guard of first generation Lacanians', focused on the symbolic—on the study of Freud through the structural linguistic tools of the fifties—and the younger group of mathematicians and philosophers centred on Jacques-Alain Miller, who favoured a self-contained Lacanianism, formalised and free of its Freudian roots.\n\nAs the seventies Lacan spoke of the mathematicisation of psychoanalysis and coined the term 'matheme' to describe its formulaic abstraction, so Leclaire brusquely dismissed the new formulas as “graffiti” Nevertheless, despite these and other tensions, the EDF held together under the charisma of their Master, until (despairing of his followers) Lacan himself dissolved the school in 1980 the year before his death.\n\nFrederick Crews writes that when Deleuze and Guattari \"indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder\" and \"pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society\" in \"Anti-Oedipus\", their \"demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable\" and \"devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris.\"\n\nThe start of the Eighties saw the Lacanian movement dissolve into a plethora of new organisations, of which the Millerite Ecole de la Cause freudienne (ECF, 273 members) and the Centre de formation et de recherches psychoanalytiques (CFRP, 390 members) are perhaps the most important. By 1993 another fourteen associations had grown out of the former EDF; nor did the process stop there. Early resignations and splits from the ECF were followed in the late 1990s by a massive exodus of analysts worldwide from Miller's organisation under allegations of misuse of authority.\n\nAttempts were made to re-unite the various factions, Leclaire arguing that Lacanianism was \"becoming ossifed, stiffening into a kind of war of religion, into theoretical debates that no longer contribute anything new\". But with French Lacanianism (in particular) haunted by a past of betrayals and conflict—by faction after faction claiming their segment of Lacanian thought as the only genuine one—reunification of any kind has proven very problematic; and Roudinesco was perhaps correct to conclude that \"'Lacanianism, born of subversion and a wish to transgress, is essentially doomed to fragility and dispersal\".\n\nThree main divisions can be made in contemporary Lacanianism.\n\nAttempts to rejoin the IPA remain problematic, however, not least due to the persistence of the 'short session' and of Lacan's rejection of countertransference as a therapeutic tool.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34600841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34600841", "title": "Marcellina (gnostic)", "text": "Marcellina (gnostic)\n\nMarcellina was an early Christian Carpocratian religious leader in the mid-second century AD known primarily from the writings of Irenaeus and Origen. She originated in Alexandria, but moved to Rome during the episcopate of Anicetus ( 157 – 168). She attracted large numbers of followers and founded the Carpocratian sect of Marcellians. Like other Carpocratians, Marcellina and her followers believed in antinomianism, also known as libertinism, the idea that obedience to laws and regulations is unnecessary in order to attain salvation. They believed that Jesus was only a man, but saw him as a model to be emulated, albeit one which a believer was capable of surpassing. Marcellina's community appears to have sought to literally implement the foundational Carpocratian teaching of social egalitarianism. The Marcellians in particular are reported to have branded their disciples on the insides of their right earlobes and venerated images of Jesus as well as Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. Although the Marcellians identified themselves as \"gnostics\", many modern scholars do not classify them as members of the sect of Gnosticism.\n\nWomen played prominent roles in many early Christians sects as prophets, teachers, healers, missionaries, and presbyters. Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany were female followers of Jesus who are mentioned in the gospels and were believed to know the \"mysteries\" of the kingdom of God. Women like Mary and Martha were the explicit role models for Marcellina and her fellow female preachers. A creed that may have been recited at Christian initiation ceremonies is quoted by the apostle Paul in : \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\" In the late first century, Marcion of Sinope ( 85 – 160) appointed women as presbyters on an equal basis as men.\n\nIn the second century, the Valentinians, a Gnostic sect, regarded women as equal to men. The Montanists regarded two prophetesses, Maximilla and Prisca, as the founders of their movement. Female religious leaders like Marcellina were not favored by orthodox theologians, who accused them of madness, unchastity, and demonic possession. The Church Father Tertullian ( 155 – 240) complained: \"These heretical women—how audacious they are! They have no modesty; they are bold enough to teach, to engage in argument, to enact exorcisms, to undertake cures, and, it may be, even to baptize!\" He denounced one female religious leader in North Africa as \"that viper\".\n\nAs a Carpocratian, Marcellina taught the doctrine of antinomianism, or libertinism, which holds that only faith and love are necessary to attain salvation and that all other perceived requirements, especially obedience to laws and regulations, are unnecessary. She, like other Carpocratians, believed that the soul must follow the path to redemption, possibly going through many incarnations. The goal of the believer is the escape from the cycle of reincarnation by ascending through several stages of deification. The Carpocratians believed that Jesus was only human, not divine, and saw him as a exemplary model to be followed, but an example which a particularly devout believer was capable of surpassing. Jesus's prime virtue was that he could perfectly remember the Divine from his pre-existence. They also venerated Greek philosophers as models to be emulated as well. The Marcellians' syncretic cult of images was a natural consequence of this teaching. One of the foundational teachings of the Carpocratians was the idea of social egalitarianism, which advocated equality for all people. Marcellina's position as the leader of the Carpocratian community in Rome indicates that, for her community at least, this was an idea which was meant to be literally implemented. Some Carpocratians, possibly including Marcellina, held all property in common and shared sexual partners. They also celebrated a form of agape feast.\n\nThe Church Father Irenaeus ( 130 – 202) records in his apologetic treatise \"Adversus Haereses\":\nOthers of them [i.e. the Carpocratians] employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] Anicetus, and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.\n\nMarcellina is the only woman associated with early Gnostic Christianity who is recorded to have been an active religious leader in her own right. Other women such as Helena (allegedly a former Tyrian prostitute turned muse of Simon Magus), Philumena (a prophetess associated with Apelles), and Flora (a student of Ptolemy) are known to have been active as prophetesses, teachers, and disciples involved in sects led by men, but none of them are known to have been leaders themselves. Nonetheless, Marcellina still appears in relation to Carpocrates, a male teacher, who appears to have been more actively involved than her in leading followers, writing treatises, and teaching students. Anne McGuire states that it is unclear whether this description of Marcellina in relation to Carpocrates is a result of Irenaeus's own patriarchal worldview, the actual relationship between her and him, or both.\n\nMarcellina's use of images of Jesus and Greek philosophers would not have been unusual in Roman society at the time, because busts and images of philosophers were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society. While Irenaeus interprets this as a sign of Marcellina's heterodox teaching, to any non-Christian Roman, it would have actually made her seem far less aberrant than \"orthodox\" Christians. By venerating busts of philosophers and including Jesus among them as the greatest, Marcellina's followers were honoring him in the same way that other philosophers were typically honored throughout the Greco-Roman world. The Carpocratians may have had a more intellectual outlook than other sects, since, according to Clement of Alexandria, Carpocrates's son Epiphanes had been trained in Platonic philosophy. Nonetheless, Michael Allen Williams states that the veneration of images seems highly unexpected for a supposedly Gnostic sect, since Gnostics are thought to have held the physical body in contempt. He suggests that Marcellina and her followers, like their pagan contemporaries, may have viewed representations of philosophers' physical likenesses as \"windows to the soul\" and a means of reflecting on the person's teachings. Peter Lampe interprets Marcillina's use of images of famous philosophers as an indication of religious syncretism.\n\nJoan E. Taylor notes that Irenaeus does not state that the Marcellians' portrait of Jesus was inaccurate or that portraits of Jesus were inherently immoral. She also argues that the Marcellians' busts of Jesus and other philosophers may have survived long after their sect declined, observing that, nearly a century later, the Roman emperor Alexander Severus (reigned 222 – 235) is said to have possessed a collection of portrait busts of various philosophers, religious figures, and historical figures including Jesus, Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, Alexander the Great, and Abraham. She remarks, \"For all we know, one of the many unidentified philosopher busts that exist in today's collections might have been thought of as Jesus in the second–third centuries.\"\n\nAccording to David Brakke, the reason why Marcellina and the members of her school identified themselves as \"Gnostics\" was not as a sectarian identification with the branch of early Christianity known as \"Gnosticism\", but rather as an epithet for \"the ideal or true Christian, the one whose acquaintance with God has been perfected\". He notes that Irenaeus himself identifies Marcellina and her sect with the Carpocratians, not with the \"Gnostic school of thought\". Also, Hippolytus of Rome, who relied on Irenaeus as a source, references that the another sect known as the Naassenes \"call themselves 'gnostics' in their own way, as if they alone have drunk from the amazing acquaintance of the Perfect and Good.\" In the late fourth century, the ascetic monk Evagrius Ponticus described the most advanced stage of Christian asceticism as \"the Gnostic\", indicating that, despite the association of the word \"Gnostic\" with Gnosticism, it still retained its original positive meaning in the sense with which Marcellina and her disciples identified. Bentley Layton does not classify Marcellina and her followers as members of the Gnostic sect either.\n\nOrigen ( 184 – 253) also briefly mentions Marcellina in his \"Contra Celsum\", stating that \"Celsus knows also of Marcellians who follow Marcellina, and Harpocratians who follow Salome, and others who follow Mariamme, and others who follow Martha.\" Anne McGuire states that, because all the other figures listed by Origen in this passage are figures who appear in the canonical gospels, it is possible that the Marcellians may have regarded Marcellina, not only as a teacher and religious leader, but as \"an authoritative source of apostolic tradition\". Williams notes that Origen seems to have been aware that the Marcellians called themselves Gnostics, since, elsewhere in \"Contra Celsum\", he notes that one of Celsus's arguments against Christianity was the existence of different sects, including ones \"who call themselves gnostics\". This would presumably include Marcellina and her followers, but Origen refrains from calling them by this term.\n\nIt is unclear how Marcellina and her followers were regarded by orthodox Christians living in Rome during the 150s and 160s. Irenaeus states that, among members of his own congregation in Gaul in the 180s, \"we have no fellowship with them either in doctrine or in morals or in our daily social life\", but this statement should not be taken to apply to Christians living in Rome over twenty years prior. Irenaeus also states, \"Satan had set forth these people [i.e. Marcellina and her followers] to blaspheme the holy name of the church, so that the [pagan] people turn their ears from the preaching of truth when they hear their different way of teaching and think we Christians are all like them. Indeed, when they see their religiosity, they dishonor us all.\" He adds that \"They misuse the name [Christian] as a mask.\" This indicates that Marcellina and her Carpocratian followers called themselves \"Christians\" and, at least to outsiders, her sect appeared to be connected to other branches of Christianity.\n\nPeter Lampe states that it is possible that members of the orthodox community in Rome simply allowed Marcillina and her sect to silently coexist, but that it is also possible that they may have actively condemned them. Robert M. Grant identifies the anti-Gnostic writings of Polycarp and Justin Martyr as partially an indirect reaction against Marcellina and her permissive moral teachings. Marcillina and other female prophets like her were consistently portrayed negatively in the histories and canons written by proponents of orthodoxy. According to William H. Brackney, sources indicate that Carpocratians may have continued to exist as late as the fourth century.\n\n"}

The word originates in the Middle German word \"muckern\", which was used also to denote the clearing of stalls and stables. In some areas of Germany, the word was spelled \"muggeln.\" \n\nSchönherr, the son of a non-commissioned officer at Memel in Prussia, was educated at the university of Königsberg, where at that time the theological faculty, under the influence of Kantian idealism, was strongly rationalist in tendency. The lad, who was miserably poor, was dissatisfied with a philosophy which stopped short of an explanation of the \"thing in itself\", and, having been reared in the strictest Lutheran orthodoxy, set to work to develop, with the aid of the Bible, a philosophy of his own. In the end he believed himself to have reached ultimate knowledge, and became the prophet of a dualistic theosophy so closely analogous to Gnosticism that it might have been taken for a deliberate revival, had not Schönherr's lack of study in such theology precluded any such idea.\n\nAmong his converts was Ebel, who from 1810 onwards gained a great reputation in Königsberg as an earnest preacher of the orthodox doctrines of \"sin, grace and redemption, and in 1816 was appointed \"archdeacon,\" i.e. principal pastor, at the Altstadt Church in Königsberg. In the pulpit he was orthodox; but he gathered about him a select circle of the initiated, to whom in private he taught Schönherr's doctrines. Schönherr himself sank into the background, and eventually died in 1826. But Ebel continued his teaching, and was joined in 1827 by Heinrich Diestel, also a Lutheran pastor of Königsberg. They became father confessors to a wide circle of fashionable people in the Prussian capital. In view of their peculiar teaching as to \"the purification of the flesh,\" which involved the minute regulation of the intercourse of married people, scandal was inevitable. Matters came to a head in 1835, when Count Finckenstein, himself formerly an initiate, denounced the two pastors and accused them of immorality.\n\nDiestel wrote two tirades against the count, who brought a successful action for slander. The group itself was dissolved in 1839. The evidence taken in the case was then laid before the old-Prussian Königsberg consistory, and proceedings followed which became famous as the Königsberger \"Religionsprozess\" (1835–1841), ending in sentences of deprivation on both Ebel and Diestel. The charges of actual immorality were dismissed; but there is no doubt that some of their followers established practices akin to those of the Agapemone and the Perfectionists. Some of them migrated to Brazil, where in 1874 at Porto Alegre a company of them came into collision with the military (see Revolt of the Muckers).\n\nIn Brazil the Muckers are remembered in popular culture. For example in 1993, when there were number of murders near São Leopoldo; the local newspaper \"Zero Hora\" ran a headline \"Violence is Resurrected in the Land of the Muckers\".\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, two films were made in Brazil about Jacobina Mentz Maurer, one of the leaders of the Muckers Brazilian rebellion. The better known of the two films was made by Fábio Barreto in 2002 and is called \"A Paixão de Jacobina\" (\"Jacobina's Passion\").\n\n\n"}

He has previously taught at Monash University and Deakin University, and during 2006–2007 he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame. He works mainly at the intersections of philosophy (in both the analytic and Continental traditions), religion, and theology.\n\nNick Trakakis completed a Bachelor of Theology degree at St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College (Sydney, Australia) and a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of New England, Australia, before going on to receive a First Class Honours in Philosophy from the University of Melbourne. His doctoral research, undertaken at Monash University, concentrated on the so-called 'evidential problem of evil', that is, the problem of determining whether the existence of human and animal suffering provides good evidence against the existence of God. A revised version of his thesis was published by Springer under the title of \"The God Beyond Belief\".\n\nIn a number of journal articles and in his recent monograph, \"The God Beyond Belief\", Trakakis considers various aspects of the evidential problem of evil, particularly as this has been formulated and developed by William Rowe. Trakakis has also written about such topics in the philosophy of religion as the omnipotence of God, determinist models of divine providence, Wittgensteinian non-realism, and the doctrine of karma. In theology and church history, he has published his views on the ordination of women, the infallibility of the church, the iconoclast controversy, and the work of Gregory Palamas.\n\nThe main conclusion reached by Trakakis is that Rowe's evidential argument from evil, or a version thereof, succeeds in showing that the existence of certain kinds of evil provides strong evidence against the existence of God. The possibility, however, is always left open that there may well be other evidence in support of the existence of God which outweighs or defeats the evidence of evil. \n\nThis conclusion is based on, first, the rejection the sceptical theist's appeal to mystery, and second, the inadequacy of standard theodicies to explain the existence of natural evil.\n\nTrakakis argues that there is no good reason to accept the currently popular 'sceptical theist' response to the evidential problem of evil – that is, the response that we do not know, and we cannot be expected to know, what God's reasons are for permitting evil. Trakakis has, for example, argued that the sceptical theist position of Kirk Durston – a position which maintains that the complexity of history is such that we cannot pass judgement on the overall moral value of any particular historical event – leads to an implausible form of moral scepticism.\n\nTrakakis also maintains that some of the major theodicies that have been offered by theists (e.g., the free will theodicy, the soul-making theodicy) fail to explain why God would permit various types of evil, particularly 'natural evil' or suffering brought about by natural processes (e.g., natural disasters). However, he does believe that the free-will theodicy may succeed in explaining at least some kinds of moral evil. On this issue, Joel Thomas Tierno has argued against Trakakis that human freedom alone can not account for all instances of moral evil, given the scale on which we find it distributed in the world.\n\nIn his current research, Trakakis is exploring various approaches to the philosophy of religion, focusing in particular on analytic and Continental approaches. He has also published two volumes of poetry and philosophical reflections, \"Tears\" (2005) and \"Silent Transfigurations\" (2006), with a third volume (\"Via Dolorosa\") forthcoming.\n\n\n\n"}

Sometimes she is said to be the syzygy of Adam, or wife of Noah, and daughter of Eve. Norea is perceived within gnostic thought as Sophia after her fall from grace.\n\nFor a long time, Norea was known from a summary of a book called \"Noria\" in the \"Panarion\" (\"Against Heresies\") of Epiphanius of Salamis (26.1.3-9). According to Epiphanius, the Borborites identified Norea with Pyrrha, the wife of Deucalion (a Greek figure similar to Noah), because \"nura\" means \"fire\" in Syriac. She burned Noah's Ark three times, then revealed the means of recovering stolen sparks through sexual emissions. Elsewhere (39.5.2) Epiphanius says that the Sethians consider Horaia to be the wife of Seth.\n\nMore information has been available since the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945. In \"The Hypostasis of the Archons\" (\"The Reality of the Rulers\"), Norea is the daughter of Eve and the younger sister of Seth; both are members of the pure race. The archons decide to destroy the world with a deluge, but their leader, the Demiurge, warns Noah to build an ark, which Norea tries to board. Noah stops her, so she blows upon the ark and sets it ablaze. The rulers try to rape her, but she cries to the God of the Entirety for help. The angel Eleleth appears and frightens the rulers away before revealing her origins; she is a child of the spirit.\n\nAnother Nag Hammadi text, the \"Thought of Norea\" (or \"Ode on Norea\") is a first-person account of Norea's plea to God. \"On the Origin of the World\" refers the reader to an \"Account of Oraia\" and the \"First Book of Noraia\", one of which may be the same as the Book of Noria mentioned by Epiphanius.\n\nShe has several similar names, including Orea and Horaia, meaning \"beautiful\". The name is thought to derive from a translation of Naamah, a Hebrew name which means \"pleasant\". The demon Naamah is called \"the younger Lilith\". Both Norea and Lilith call upon God to avoid an unwanted sexual encounter.\n\n"}

{"id": "48041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48041", "title": "Relativism", "text": "Relativism\n\nRelativism is the idea that views are relative to differences in perception and consideration. There is no universal, objective truth according to relativism; rather each point of view has its own truth.\n\nThe major categories of relativism vary in their degree of scope and controversy. \"Moral relativism\" encompasses the differences in moral judgments among people and cultures.\n\"Truth relativism\" is the doctrine that there are no absolute truths, i.e., that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture (cultural relativism). Descriptive relativism seeks to describe the differences among cultures and people without evaluation, while normative relativism evaluates the morality or truthfulness of views within a given framework.\n\nAnthropological relativism refers to a methodological stance, in which the researcher suspends (or brackets) his or her own cultural biases while attempting to understand beliefs and behaviors in their local contexts. This has become known as methodological relativism, and concerns itself specifically with avoiding ethnocentrism or the application of one's own cultural standards to the assessment of other cultures. This is also the basis of the so-called \"emic\" and \"etic\" distinction, in which:\n\nPhilosophical relativism, in contrast, asserts that the truth of a proposition depends on the metaphysical, or theoretical frame, or the instrumental method, or the context in which the proposition is expressed, or on the person, groups, or culture who interpret the proposition.\n\nMethodological relativism and philosophical relativism can exist independently from one another, but most anthropologists base their methodological relativism on that of the philosophical variety.\n\nThe concept of relativism also has importance both for philosophers and for anthropologists in another way. In general, anthropologists engage in descriptive relativism (\"how things are\" or \"how things seem\"), whereas philosophers engage in normative relativism (\"how things ought to be\"), although there is some overlap (for example, descriptive relativism can pertain to concepts, normative relativism to truth).\n\nDescriptive relativism assumes that certain cultural groups have different modes of thought, standards of reasoning, and so forth, and it is the anthropologist's task to describe, but not to evaluate the validity of these principles and practices of a cultural group. It is possible for an anthropologist in his or her fieldwork to be a descriptive relativist about some things that typically concern the philosopher (e.g., ethical principles) but not about others (e.g., logical principles). However, the descriptive relativist's empirical claims about epistemic principles, moral ideals and the like are often countered by anthropological arguments that such things are universal, and much of the recent literature on these matters is explicitly concerned with the extent of, and evidence for, cultural or moral or linguistic or human universals.\n\nThe fact that the various species of descriptive relativism are empirical claims, may tempt the philosopher to conclude that they are of little philosophical interest, but there are several reasons why this isn't so. First, some philosophers, notably Kant, argue that certain sorts of cognitive differences between human beings (or even all rational beings) are impossible, so such differences could never be found to obtain in fact, an argument that places a priori limits on what empirical inquiry could discover and on what versions of descriptive relativism could be true. Second, claims about actual differences between groups play a central role in some arguments for normative relativism (for example, arguments for normative ethical relativism often begin with claims that different groups in fact have different moral codes or ideals). Finally, the anthropologist's descriptive account of relativism helps to separate the fixed aspects of human nature from those that can vary, and so a descriptive claim that some important aspect of experience or thought does (or does not) vary across groups of human beings tells us something important about human nature and the human condition.\n\nNormative relativism concerns normative or evaluative claims that modes of thought, standards of reasoning, or the like are only right or wrong relative to a framework. ‘Normative’ is meant in a general sense, applying to a wide range of views; in the case of beliefs, for example, normative correctness equals truth. This does not mean, of course, that framework-relative correctness or truth is always clear, the first challenge being to explain what it amounts to in any given case (e.g., with respect to concepts, truth, epistemic norms). Normative relativism (say, in regard to normative ethical relativism) therefore implies that things (say, ethical claims) are not simply true in themselves, but only have truth values relative to broader frameworks (say, moral codes). (Many normative ethical relativist arguments run from premises about ethics to conclusions that assert the relativity of truth values, bypassing general claims about the nature of truth, but it is often more illuminating to consider the type of relativism under question directly.)\n\nThe term \"relativism\" often comes up in debates over postmodernism, poststructuralism and phenomenology. Critics of these perspectives often identify advocates with the label \"relativism\". For example, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is often considered a relativist view because it posits that linguistic categories and structures shape the way people view the world. Stanley Fish has defended postmodernism and relativism.\n\nThese perspectives do not strictly count as relativist in the philosophical sense, because they express agnosticism on the nature of reality and make epistemological rather than ontological claims. Nevertheless, the term is useful to differentiate them from realists who believe that the purpose of philosophy, science, or literary critique is to locate externally true meanings. Important philosophers and theorists such as Michel Foucault, Max Stirner, political movements such as post-anarchism or post-Marxism can also be considered as relativist in this sense - though a better term might be social constructivist.\n\nThe spread and popularity of this kind of \"soft\" relativism varies between academic disciplines. It has wide support in anthropology and has a majority following in cultural studies. It also has advocates in political theory and political science, sociology, and continental philosophy (as distinct from Anglo-American analytical philosophy). It has inspired empirical studies of the social construction of meaning such as those associated with labelling theory, which defenders can point to as evidence of the validity of their theories (albeit risking accusations of performative contradiction in the process). Advocates of this kind of relativism often also claim that recent developments in the natural sciences, such as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, quantum mechanics, chaos theory and complexity theory show that science is now becoming relativistic. However, many scientists who use these methods continue to identify as realist or post-positivist, and some sharply criticize the association.\n\nRelationism is the theory that there are only relations between individual entities, and no intrinsic\nproperties. Despite the similarity in name, it is held by some to be a position distinct from relativism—for instance, because \"statements about relational properties [...] assert an absolute truth about things in the world\".\nOn the other hand, others wish to equate relativism, relationism and even relativity, which is a precise theory of relationships between physical objects: Nevertheless, \"This confluence of relativity theory with relativism became a strong contributing factor in the increasing prominence of relativism\".\n\nWhereas previous investigations of science only sought sociological or psychological explanations of failed scientific theories or pathological science, the 'strong programme' is more relativistic, assessing scientific truth and falsehood equally in a historic and cultural context.\n\nRelativism is not skepticism, which superficially resembles relativism, because they both doubt absolute notions of truth. However, whereas skeptics go on to doubt all notions of truth, relativists replace absolute truth with a positive theory of many equally valid relative truths. For the relativist, there is no more to\ntruth than the right context, or the right personal or cultural belief, so there is a lot of truth in the world.\n\nThe Catholic Church, especially under John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today.\n\nAccording to the Church and to some theologians, relativism, as a denial of absolute truth, leads to moral license and a denial of the possibility of sin and of God. Whether moral or epistemological, relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth. Truth, according to Catholic theologians and philosophers (following Aristotle) consists of \"adequatio rei et intellectus\", the correspondence of the mind and reality. Another way of putting it states that the mind has the same form as reality. This means when the form of the computer in front of someone (the type, color, shape, capacity, etc.) is also the form that is in their mind, then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality.\n\nThe denial of an absolute reference, of an \"axis mundi,\" denies God, who equates to Absolute Truth, according to these Christian theologians. They link relativism to secularism, an obstruction of religion in human life.\n\nPope Leo XIII (1810–1903) was the first known Pope to use the word relativism in the encyclical \"Humanum genus\" (1884). Leo XIII condemned Freemasonry and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism.\n\nJohn Paul II in \"Veritatis Splendor\"\n\nIn \"Evangelium Vitae\" (The Gospel of Life), he says:\n\nIn April 2005, in his homily during Mass prior to the conclave which would elect him as Pope, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger talked about the world \"moving towards a dictatorship of relativism\":\n\nOn June 6, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI told educators:\n\nThen during the World Youth Day in August 2005, he also traced to relativism the problems produced by the communist and sexual revolutions, and provided a counter-counter argument.\n\nA common argument against relativism suggests that it inherently contradicts, refutes, or stultifies itself: the statement \"all is relative\" classes either as a relative statement or as an absolute one. If it is relative, then this statement does not rule out absolutes. If the statement is absolute, on the other hand, then it provides an example of an absolute statement, proving that not all truths are relative. However, this argument against relativism only applies to relativism that positions truth as relative–i.e. epistemological/truth-value relativism. More specifically, it is only extreme forms of epistemological relativism that can come in for this criticism as there are many epistemological relativists who posit that some aspects of what is regarded as factually \"true\" are not universal, yet still accept that other universal truths exist (e.g. gas laws or moral laws).\n\nAnother argument against relativism posits a Natural Law. Simply put, the physical universe works under basic principles: the \"Laws of Nature\". Some contend that a natural Moral Law may also exist, for example as argued by Richard Dawkins in \"The God Delusion\" (2006) and addressed by C. S. Lewis in \"Mere Christianity\" (1952). Dawkins said \"I think we face an equal but much more sinister challenge from the left, in the shape of cultural relativism - the view that scientific truth is only one kind of truth and it is not to be especially privileged\".\nPhilosopher Hilary Putnam, among others, states that some forms of relativism make it impossible to believe one is in error. If there is no truth beyond an individual's belief that something is true, then an individual cannot hold their own beliefs to be false or mistaken. A related criticism is that relativizing truth to individuals destroys the distinction between truth and belief.\n\nIndian religions tend to view the perceivable universe and cosmos as relativistic. Mahavira (599-527 BC), the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, developed an early philosophy regarding relativism and subjectivism known as Anekantavada. Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. A Rig Vedic hymn states that \"Truth is One, though the sages tell it variously.\" (Ékam sat vipra bahudā vadanti)\n\nMadhyamaka Buddhism, which forms the basis for many Mahayana Buddhist schools and was founded by Nagarjuna, discerns two levels of truth, absolute and relative. The two truths doctrine states that there is \"Relative\" or common-sense truth, which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and \"Ultimate\" truth, which describes the ultimate reality as sunyata, empty of concrete and inherent characteristics. The conventional truth may be interpreted as \"obscurative truth\" or \"that which obscures the true nature\" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.\n\nIn Sikhism the Gurus (spiritual teacher ) have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the one God and ultimate salvation for all souls who tread on the path of righteousness. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths can, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the Lord, certainly achieve salvation. The students of the Sikh faith are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. The holy book of the Sikhs called the Sri Guru Granth Sahib says: \"Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.\" Guru Granth Sahib page 1350; later stating \"The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months, and the various seasons originate from the one Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator.\" Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13.\n\nSophists are considered the founding fathers of relativism in the Western World. Elements of relativism emerged among the Sophists in the 5th century BC. Notably, it was Protagoras who coined the phrase, \"Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not.\" The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponents, Plato and Socrates. In a well known paraphrased dialogue with Socrates, Protagoras said: \"What is true for you is true for you, and what is true for me is true for me.\"\n\nAnother important advocate of relativism, Bernard Crick, a British political scientist, wrote the book \"In Defence of Politics\" (first published in 1962), suggesting the inevitability of moral conflict between people. Crick stated that only ethics could resolve such conflict, and when that occurred in public it resulted in politics. Accordingly, Crick saw the process of dispute resolution, harms reduction, mediation or peacemaking as central to all of moral philosophy. He became an important influence on the feminists and later on the Greens.\n\nThe philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend is often considered to be a relativist, though he denied being one.\n\nFeyerabend argued that modern science suffers from being methodologically monistic (the belief that only a single methodology can produce scientific progress). Feyerabend summarises his case in his work Against Method with the phrase \"anything goes\".\n\nThomas Kuhn's philosophy of science, as expressed in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" is often interpreted as relativistic. He claimed that as well as progressing steadily and incrementally (\"normal science\"), science undergoes periodic revolutions or \"paradigm shifts\", leaving scientists working in different paradigms with difficulty in even communicating. Thus the truth of a claim, or the existence of a posited entity is relative to the paradigm employed. However, it isn't necessary for him to embrace relativism because every paradigm presupposes the prior, building upon itself through history and so on. This leads to there being a fundamental, incremental, and referential structure of development which is not relative but again, fundamental.\n\nBut Thomas Kuhn denied the accusation of being a relativist later in his postscript.\n\nSome have argued that one can also read Kuhn's work as essentially positivist in its ontology: the revolutions he posits are epistemological, lurching toward a presumably 'better' understanding of an objective reality through the lens presented by the new paradigm. However, a number of passages in Structures do indeed appear to be distinctly relativist, and to directly challenge the notion of an objective reality and the ability of science to progress towards an ever-greater grasp of it, particularly through the process of paradigm change.\n\nGeorge Lakoff and Mark Johnson define relativism in their book \"Metaphors We Live By\" as the rejection of both subjectivism and metaphysical objectivism in order to focus on the relationship between them, i.e. the metaphor by which we relate our current experience to our previous experience. In particular, Lakoff and Johnson characterize \"objectivism\" as a \"straw man\", and, to a lesser degree, criticize the views of Karl Popper, Kant and Aristotle.\n\nIn his book \"Invariances\", Robert Nozick expresses a complex set of theories about the absolute and the relative. He thinks the absolute/relative distinction should be recast in terms of an invariant/variant distinction, where there are many things a proposition can be invariant with regard to or vary with. He thinks it is coherent for truth to be relative, and speculates that it might vary with time. He thinks necessity is an unobtainable notion, but can be approximated by robust invariance across a variety of conditions—although we can never identify a proposition that is invariant with regard to everything. Finally, he is not particularly warm to one of the most famous forms of relativism, moral relativism, preferring an evolutionary account.\n\nJoseph Margolis advocates a view he calls \"robust relativism\" and defends it in his books: \"Historied Thought, Constructed World\", Chapter 4 (California, 1995) and \"The Truth about Relativism\" (Blackwells, 1991). He opens his account by stating that our logics should depend on what we take to be the nature of the sphere to which we wish to apply our logics. Holding that there can be no distinctions which are not \"privileged\" between the alethic, the ontic, and the epistemic, he maintains that a many valued logic just might be the most apt for aesthetics or history since, because in these practices, we are loath to hold to simple binary logic; and he also holds that many-valued logic is relativistic. (This is perhaps an unusual definition of \"relativistic\". Compare with his comments on \"relationism\"). \"True\" and \"False\" as mutually exclusive and exhaustive judgements on Hamlet, for instance, really does seem absurd. A many valued logic—\"apt\", \"reasonable\", \"likely\", and so on—seems intuitively more applicable to Hamlet interpretation. Where apparent contradictions arise between such interpretations, we might call the interpretations \"incongruent\", rather than dubbing either \"false\", because using many-valued logic implies that a measured value is a mixture of two extreme possibilities. Using the subset of many-valued logic, fuzzy logic, it can be said that various interpretations can be represented by membership in more than one possible truth sets simultaneously. Fuzzy logic is therefore probably the best mathematical structure for understanding \"robust relativism\" and has been interpreted by Bart Kosko as philosophically being related to Zen Buddhism.\n\nIt was Aristotle who held that relativism implied we should, sticking with appearances only, end up contradicting ourselves somewhere if we could apply all attributes to all \"ousiai\" (beings). Aristotle, however, made non-contradiction dependent upon his essentialism. If his essentialism is false, then so too is his ground for disallowing relativism. (Subsequent philosophers have found other reasons for supporting the principle of non-contradiction).\n\nBeginning with Protagoras and invoking Charles Sanders Peirce, Margolis shows that the historic struggle to discredit relativism is an attempt to impose an unexamined belief in the world's essentially rigid rule-like nature. Plato and Aristotle merely attacked \"relationalism\"—the doctrine of true-for l or true for k, and the like, where l and k are different speakers or different worlds, or the something similar (Most philosophers would call this position \"relativism\"). For Margolis, \"true\" means true; that is, the alethic use of \"true\" remains untouched. However, in real world contexts, and context is ubiquitous in the real world, we must apply truth values. Here, in epistemic terms, we might retire \"true\" \"tout court\" as an evaluation and keep \"false\". The rest of our value-judgements could be graded from \"extremely plausible\" down to \"false\". Judgements which on a bivalent logic would be incompatible or contradictory are further seen as \"incongruent\", though one may well have more weight than the other. In short, relativistic logic is not, or need not be, the bugbear it is often presented to be. It may simply be the best type of logic to apply to certain very uncertain spheres of real experiences in the world (although some sort of logic needs to be applied to make that judgement). Those who swear by bivalent logic might simply be the ultimate keepers of the great fear of the flux.\n\nPhilosopher Richard Rorty has a somewhat paradoxical role in the debate over relativism: he is criticized for his relativistic views by many commentators, but has always denied that relativism applies to much anybody, being nothing more than a Platonic scarecrow. Rorty claims, rather, that he is a pragmatist, and that to construe pragmatism as relativism is to beg the question.\n\nRorty takes a deflationary attitude to truth, believing there is nothing of interest to be said about truth in general, including the contention that it is generally subjective. He also argues that the notion of warrant or justification can do most of the work traditionally assigned to the concept of truth, and that justification \"is\" relative; justification is justification to an audience, for Rorty.\n\nIn \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\" he argues that the debate between so-called relativists and so-called objectivists is beside the point because they don't have enough premises in common for either side to prove anything to the other.\n\nThe late Sir Isaiah Berlin expressed a relativistic view when he stated that, to \"confuse our own constructions with eternal laws or divine decrees is one of the most fatal delusions of men.\" And again when he said, \"the concept of fact is itself problematic…all facts embody theories...or socially conditioned, ideological attitudes.\"\n\n\n"}

On his arrival Kao-feng asked why he came to his hermitage to which Shiwu answered \"I've come for the Dharma\". \n\nKao-feng said \"The Dharma isn't so easy to find. You've got to burn your fingers for incense\". \n\nShiwu replied \"But I see the Master before me with my own eyes. How could the Dharma be hidden?\". \n\nKao-feng took him as his pupil and gave him the koan \"All things return to one\" for study.\n\nAfter three years with little progress, Shiwu decided to leave and Kao-feng recommended he study under the Chan master Chi-an. Shiwu crossed the Yangtze and met Chi-an at West Peak Temple near Chienyang. \n\nChi-an asked Shiwu what teaching he had received. \n\nShiwu said, \"All things return to one\". \n\nChi-an asked what it meant and Shiwu remained silent. \n\nChi-an said \"Those words are dead. Where did you pick up such rot?\". \n\nShiwu bowed and asked for instruction. \n\nChi-an then gave him another koan: \"Where buddhas dwell, don't stop. Where buddhas don't dwell, hurry past\". \n\nShiwu said he didn't understand but decided to stay with Chi-an. \n\nOne day, Chi-an asked once more about the koan and Shiwu answered, \"When you mount the horse, you see the road\". \n\nChi-an admonished him once again. \n\nShiwu left but on his way down the mountain he saw a pavilion and had a sudden insight. He turned back and told Chi-an, \"Where buddhas dwell, don't stop. Those are dead words. Where buddhas don't dwell, hurry past. Those are dead words too. Now I understand living words\".\n\nChi-an asked him what he understood and Shiwu answered, \"When the rain finally stops in late spring, the oriole appears on a branch\" \n\nChi-an later served as abbot of the Taochang temple and Shiwu joined him. Shiwu also served as a meditation teacher in Lingyin temple. \n\nIn 1312 at the age of forty he moved to Xiamu Mountain near Huzhou to live as a hermit and it is here that he composed his \"Mountain Poems\" (Shan-shih), one-hundred and eighty-four verses mostly dealing with life in the mountains. In the preface to the Mountain poems, Shiwu writes: \n\nHere in the woods I have lots of free time. When I don't spend it sleeping, I enjoy composing gathas. But with paper and ink so scarce, I haven't thought of writing them down. Now some Zen monks have asked me to record what I find of interest on this mountain. I've sat here quietly and let my brush fly. Suddenly, this volume is full. I close it and sent it back down with the admonition not to try singing these poems. Only if you sit on them will they do you any good. \n\nThe opening poem of the Shan-Shi describes the natural setting of his hermitage: \n\nMany of his poems deal with the mundane facets of everyday hermit life. \n\nSome of the poems also focus on Zen Buddhist philosophical ideals like impermanence and non-attachment.\n\nAmerican translator Red Pine traveled to the Zhongnan Mountains and translated Shiwu's poems into English.\n\n\n"}

Stich (born May 9, 1943) is a professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers University, as well as an Honorary Professor in Philosophy at the University of Sheffield. Stich's main philosophical interests are in the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and moral psychology. His 1983 book, \"From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science: The Case Against Belief\", received much attention as he argued for a form of eliminative materialism about the mind. He changed his mind, in later years, as indicated in his 1996 book \"Deconstructing the Mind\".\n\nStich was an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania from 1960–1964 where he was a member of the Philomathean Society. He received his BA in 1964 (Summa Cum Laude with distinction in Philosophy). He did graduate work at Princeton University from 1964–1968, he received his PhD in 1968.\n\nHe has held teaching positions at University of Michigan, University of Maryland, College Park, University of California, San Diego, University of Sheffield, and Rutgers University.\n\nStich joined the University of Sheffield as an honorary professor in their philosophy department in February 2005. He remains primarily at Rutgers, but visits Sheffield periodically, where he teaches and works at the Hang Seng Centre for Cognitive Studies.\n\nIn 2007 he was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize and gave a series of lectures in Paris titled \"Moral Theory Meets Cognitive Science: How the Cognitive Science Can Transform Traditional Debates\".\n\nIn 2009, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nStich is primarily known in philosophy for his work in the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, epistemology, and moral psychology. In philosophy of mind and cognitive science, Stich (1983) has argued for a form of eliminative materialism—the view that talk of the mental should be replaced with talk of its physical substrate. Since then, however, he has changed some of his views on the mind. See \"Deconstructing the Mind\" (1996) for his more recent views. In epistemology, he has explored (with several of his colleagues) the nature of intuitions using the techniques of experimental philosophy, especially epistemic intuitions that vary among cultures—see Stich (1988) and Stich, et al. (2001). This work reflects a general skepticism about conceptual analysis and the traditional methods of analytic philosophy. In \"The Fragmentation of Reason\" he briefly sketched a form of epistemic relativism \"in the spirit of pragmatism.\"\n\nHe and Shaun Nichols are responsible for a theory of how humans understand the mental states of ourselves and others, or mindreading, which they present in Nichols and Stich (2003). Their theory is a hybrid, containing elements of both the simulation theory and theory theory, and also aims to explain the mental architecture that enables pretence.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2801898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2801898", "title": "The Grammar of Science", "text": "The Grammar of Science\n\nThe Grammar of Science is a book by Karl Pearson first published in hardback in 1892. In 1900, the second edition, published by Adam & Charles Black, appeared. The third, revised, edition was also published by Adam & Charles Black in 1911. It was recommended by Einstein to his friends of the Olympia Academy. Several themes were covered in this book that later became part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists, such as:\n\"Introductory - The Scope and Method of Science\"\n\n\"The Facts of Science\"\n\n\"The Scientific Law\"\n\n\"Cause and Effect - Probability\" \n\n\"Contingency and Correlation - The Insufficiency of Causation\"\n\n\"Space and Time\"\n\n\"The Geometry of Motion\"\n\n\"Matter\"\n\nThe notion of matter is found to be equally obscure whether we seek for definition in the writings of physicists or of \"common sense\" philosophers. The difficulties with regard to it appear to arise from asserting the phenomenal but imperceptible existence of mere conceptual symbols. Change of sense-impression is the proper term for external perception. Motion is the proper term for our conceptual symbolisation of this change. Of perception the question \"what moves\" and \"why it moves\" are seen to be idle. In the field of conception, the moving bodies are geometrical ideals with merely descriptive motions.\n\nIn order to understand that we can perceive change of sense-impression but we can only conceive motion, three questions must be asked: \"What moves? Why does it move? How does it move?\". Science can only answer the question \"How does it move?\". The others are unintelligible, because we find that matter, force, and \"action at a distance\" are not terms which express real problems of the phenomenal world.\n\n\"The Laws of Motion\"\n\nThe physicist forms a conceptual model of the universe by the aid of corpuscles. These corpuscles are only symbols for the component parts of perceptual bodies and are not to be considered as in any way resembling definite perceptual equivalents. The corpuscles with which we have to deal are ether-element, prime-atom, atom, molecule, and particle. We conceive them to move in the manner which enables us most accurately to describe the sequences of our sense-impressions. This manner of motion is summed up in the so-called laws of motion. These laws hold in the first place for particles, but they have been frequently assumed to be true for all corpuscles. It is more reasonable, however, to conceive that a great part of mechanism flows from the structure of gross \"matter.\"\n\nThe proper measure of mass is found to be a ratio of mutual accelerations, and force is seen to be a certain convenient measure of motion, and not its cause. The customary definitions of mass and force, as well as the Newtonian statement of the laws of motion, are shown to abound in metaphysical obscurities. It is also questionable whether the principles involved in the current statements as to the superposition and combination of forces are scientifically correct when applied to atoms and molecules. The hope for future progress lies in clearer conceptions of the nature of ether and of the structure of gross \"matter.\"\n\nThe general laws of motion are expressed as extensions of Newton's Laws\n\nFirst Law: \"Every corpuscle in the conceptual model of the universe must be conceived as moving with due regard to the presence of every other corpuscle, although for very distant corpuscles the regard paid is extremely small as compared with that paid to immediate neighbours.\"\n\nSecond Law: \"Principle of Inertia\"\n\nThird Law: \"Mutual Acceleration is determined by Relative Position\"\n\nFourth Law: \"The ratio of the acceleration of A due to B to the acceleration of B due to A must always be considered to be the same whatever be the position of A and B, and whatever be the surrounding field\"\n\nFifth Law: \"The Definition of Force - The force of B on A is equal and opposite to the force of A on B\"\n\n\"Modern Physical Ideas\"\n\nThe development of physical science over the last twenty years has revealed phenomena which illustrate clearly the principles and method of the preceding chapters. The Newtonian scheme of dynamics has been shown to be an approximation valid only for gross matter and our gross senses. There is reasonable ground for supposing that an electro-magnetic scheme of the constitution of matter will prove far more comprehensive. But there are outstanding difficulties, notably that gravitation has so far defied all efforts to bring it into line with this scheme, and that no simple concept has yet been furnished to represent the positive electricity of experiment.\n\nThe principles of conservation of energy, momentum, and mass all become meaningless without an ether which is as much and as little a reality as matter, and then mass, energy, momentum, are quantities in the same category with force.\n\nThe constancy of the mass of a body in material dynamics, which is the whole experimental basis of that science, is replaced by the conception of all electrons of the same type (negative, possibly also positive) being identical in character.\n\nThe ether is a purely conceptual medium which, as far as theory is at present developed, is structureless except that at isolated points there exist centres at which its properties are exceptional. These centres, by their mutual motion and grouping, constitute the model of the sequence of natural phenomena.\n\nNew light is thrown on our conceptions of space and time. They are interdependent and conditioned by the phenomena which they are used to describe. The phrase \"motion relative to the ether\" becomes meaningless. The ether is becoming more and more clearly a concept in the mind of each observer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "92200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92200", "title": "Utterance", "text": "Utterance\n\nIn spoken language analysis, an utterance is the smallest unit of speech. It is a continuous piece of speech beginning and ending with a clear pause. In the case of oral languages, it is generally but not always bounded by silence. Utterances do not exist in written language, only their representations do. They can be represented and delineated in written language in many ways.\n\nIn oral/spoken language utterances have several features including paralinguistic features which are aspects of speech such as facial expression, gesture, and posture. Prosodic features include stress, intonation, and tone of voice, as well as ellipsis, which are words that the listener inserts in spoken language to fill gaps. Moreover, other aspects of utterances found in spoken languages are non-fluency features including: voiced/un-voiced pauses (like \"umm\"), tag questions, and false starts when someone begins their utterances again to correct themselves. Other features include: fillers (\"and stuff\"); accent/dialect; deictic expressions, which are utterances like \"over there!\" which need further explanation to be understood; simple conjunctions (\"and,\" \"but,\" etc.); and colloquial lexis which are everyday informal words.\n\nUtterances that are portrayed in writing are planned, in contrast to utterances in improvised spoken language. In written language there are frameworks that are used to portray this type of language. Discourse structure (which can also be found in spoken language) is how the conversation is organized, in which adjacency pairs - an utterance and the answer to that utterance - are used. Discourse markers are used to organize conversation (\"first,\" \"secondly,\" etc.). Lexis denotes the words being used in a text or spoken; these words can create a semantic field. For example, a semantic field of love can be created with lexical choices such as adore, admire, and care. Grammar/syntax is another feature of language in general but also utterances, and pragmatics means that when utterances are spoken or written the meaning is not literal, as in sarcasm.\n\nAn utterance which is found in spoken and written language as in a script has several characteristics. These include paralinguistic features which is a feature of communication that doesn't involve words but is added around an utterance to give meaning. Examples of paralinguistic features include facial expressions, laughter, eye contact, and gestures. Prosodic features refer to the sound of someone's voice as they speak: pitch, intonation and stress. Ellipsis can be used in either written or spoken language, when an utterance is conveyed and the speaker omits words because they are already understood in the situation. For example: A: Juice? B: Please. A: Room temperature? B: Cold.\n\nNon-fluency features also occur when producing utterances. As people think about what to say to while speaking, there are errors and corrections in speech. For example, voiced/un-voiced pauses which are \"umm,\" \"erm,\" etc. in voiced pauses and in transcripts un-voiced pauses are denoted as (.) or (1) relating to the amount of time of the pause. Tag questions are also a part of non-fluency features; these are used by the speaker to check if the listener understands what the speaker is saying. An example is \"Do you know what I mean?\" False alerts occur when the speaker is voicing an utterance but stops and starts again, usually to correct themselves.\n\nFillers usually give the speaker time to think and gather their thoughts in order to continue their utterance; these include lexis such as, \"like,\" \"and stuff,\" Accent/dialect is also a characteristic included in utterances which is the way the words are voiced, the pronunciation and the different types of lexis used in different parts of the world. Deictic expressions are utterances that need more explanation in order to be understood, like: \"Wow! Look over there!\" Simple conjunctions in speech are words that connect other words like \"and,\" \"but,\" etc. Colloquial lexis is a type of speech that is casual in which the utterance is usually more relaxed.\n\nThe development of utterances in children is facilitated by parents, adults, or any other guardian the child has growing up. Studies have indicated that this development of utterances is affected by the parent, adult, or guardian's socioeconomic status (SES). It has been shown that children have larger vocabularies and learn new words more quickly during early childhood from parents with a high education and higher SES status, while children with less educated parents and lower SES status have a smaller vocabulary and a slower growth in their vocabulary skills (Arriaga, Fenson, Cronan & Pethick, 1998; Hart & Risley, 1995; Hoff, Laursen & Tardif, 2002; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1991; Lawrence & Shipley, 1996; Ninio, 1980). This correlation is due to the fact that more educated parents use more lexis when speaking to their children as opposed to parents that are less educated (Hart & Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003 a; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea & Hedges, in press). Hoff conducted an analysis that shows support for this correlation in 2003 which shows that the mean length of utterance and vocabulary of mothers who talk to their children is related to their SES status and thus child vocabulary development. High-SES mothers use longer utterances when talking to their children and a wider variety of words. They also spend more time talking to their children. Low-SES mothers use shorter utterances and a smaller vocabulary. As a result, children with more educated parents have larger vocabularies (Hoff, 2003).\n\nIn child-directed speech, utterances have several additional features. For example, the phonology in child-directed speech is different: Utterances are spoken more slowly, with longer pauses in between utterances, higher pitches, etc. The lexis and semantics differ, and a speaker uses words suited for children, \"doggie\" instead of \"dog,\" for example. The grammar is simpler, repetitive, with less use of verbs and adjectives. There is a greater use of one word utterances and the pragmatics uses supportive language like expansions and re-casting.\n\nPaul Grice (1989) came up with four maxims necessary in order to have a collegial conversation in which utterances are understood:\n\n\nAccording to philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin, there are four accepted properties that utterances should have:\n\nBakhtin also emphasizes that an utterance and a sentence are not the same thing. According to Bakhtin, sentences do not indicate a change of speech subject, and thus do not automatically satisfy one of the four properties of utterances. According to him, the sentence as a language unit is grammatical in nature, while an utterance is \"ethical\".\n\n\n"}

His father, John Bryan was a Presbyterian minister and his mother was Eliza Phillips Bryan. Having been born near Bloomington, Bryan graduated from IU with degrees in ancient classics and philosophy. His interests shifted toward psychology and Bryan went on to earn his Ph.D. in psychology from Clark University in 1892 under the direction of G. Stanley Hall.\n\nThat same year Bryan helped organize the American Psychological Association and became one of its charter members.

Cumings, to investigate the campus' water situation. On March 8, 1910, the Cumings commission recommended a site for the new reservoir, a couple miles northeast of the campus; the reservoir, which became known as the University Lake, was constructed in 1910-1914. Although no longer used for water supply, the reservoir remains, and is the centerpiece of Indiana University's Research and Teaching Preserve (Griffy Woods).\n\nWilliam Lowe Bryan died in Bloomington in 1955.

{"id": "6341920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6341920", "title": "William S. Hatcher", "text": "William S. Hatcher\n\nWilliam S. Hatcher (1935–2005) was a mathematician, philosopher, educator and a member of the Bahá'í Faith. He held a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Neuchatel, Switzerland, and bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. A specialist in the philosophical alloying of science and religion, for over thirty years he held university positions in North America, Europe, and Russia.\n\nHe was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States on 20 September 1935, and died on 27 November 2005.\n\nAlthough he made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics and philosophy, he is perhaps best known for developing a new proof of God's existence based on first-order logic and for his work towards a transcultural system of ethics.\n\nIn his books \"Love, Power, and Justice\", and \"\", Hatcher attempts to prove God's existence while addressing many of the criticisms raised against previous theistic philosophers. While Hatcher admits that his argument does not establish the existence of any particular religion's God, he asserts that it does support the existence of a God that he defines as a unique, universal, and uncaused cause.\n\nWritten in first order logic, Hatcher's proof of God is based on three axioms that he calls \"empirically grounded\" and an apriori assumption that \"something exists.\" \n\nThe axioms are that:\n\nP1. The principle of sufficient reason: All phenomena are either self-caused (i.e. A->A) or other-caused (B->A; B is not equal to A) but not both. Put another way, this principle says that the question \"why?\" is always meaningful. Everything happens for a reason.\n\nP2. The potency principle: If A -> B then for all C element of B, A -> C. In other words if A is the cause of B then A is \nthe cause of every part of B. There are several notions of causality in philosophy. Hatcher's notion of causality is total causality; i.e. it is not the straw that breaks the camel's back but the 1000 straws before it, the camel, gravity, and so forth, that give rise to the camel breaking its back.\n\nP3. The principle of limitation: For all A, where A is an element of B, B -> A does not hold. This says a system (which Hatcher represents as a set) cannot be the cause of its own components. Hatcher justifies this by explaining any system has (1) form (the parts) and (2) function (the relationship between the parts). A car (the system) cannot be the cause of its own steering wheel (a part), because the car does not even logically exist until the steering wheel exists. Thus the car's existence cannot precede the steering wheel's existence.\n\nHatcher shows that the logical outcome of these 3 axioms together with the above noted assumption are the existence of a \"unique, universal, uncaused cause.\"\n\nThroughout this work, Hatcher strives to make his assumptions (his axioms) and modus operandi (first order logic) explicit. Unlike many proofs of God (beginning with the proof advanced by Aristotle) Hatcher's proof does not appeal to the absurdity of an infinite regression of causes. Hatcher argues that because his proof is formulated in first order logic one must invalidate one or more of his three empirically grounded axioms to refute it. At the same time he shows that doing so is difficult as it commits oneself to beliefs not commonly accepted in the scientific community such as the existence of non-causal systems (something not observed to date). \n\nIn \"Love, Power and Justice,\" Hatcher outlines a system of ethics based on the principle that there is a universal human nature. As evidence, he outlines how all new born children will respond positively to love, and negatively to cruelty and hate. \n\nHatcher also speaks of intrinsic and extrinsic value. Extrinsic value is not a property of the object itself but is a socially conferred value; for example, the value given by society to money. Intrinsic value on the other hand stands inseparable from the object itself. Whereas extrinsic value can be determined by observation, intrinsic value is discovered upon reflection. Hatcher believes that human beings have intrinsic value, similar to the Kantian notion of our humanity. He says that unless we discover our own intrinsic value, we will seek it elsewhere through means such as competition.\n\nHatcher is one of eight Platonist philosophers listed for the second half of the twentieth century in the \"Encyclopedie Philosophique Universelle\".\n\nHatcher was the author of over fifty monographs, books, and articles in the mathematical sciences, logic and philosophy. Among the publications of which he is author or coauthor are: \n\nDr. Hatcher discovered the Bahá'í Faith while a student. He enrolled in the Bahá'í Faith in 1957 following which he wrote a letter to the Yale faculty explaining to the Yale Divinity School, his reasons for declining to enroll at the school where he was recently admitted. He spent the decades that followed in dedicated service to the Baha'i community and its administrative development, at the local and national level, in the United States, Switzerland, Russia, and Canada.\n\nHe served on National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Canada (1983–91) as well as on the inaugural National Spiritual Assemblies of Switzerland (1962–65) and the Russian Federation (1996). He lived in Russia from 1993 to 1998. He was also a founding member of the Association for Bahá'í Studies.\n\nIn a message of condolence, the Universal House of Justice (the international governing body of the Bahá'í Faith) said that \"The Baha'i world has lost one of its brightest minds, one of its most prolific pens ...\"\n\n\n"}
