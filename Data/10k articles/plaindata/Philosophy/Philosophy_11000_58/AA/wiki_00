{"id": "85563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85563", "title": "Adelard of Bath", "text": "Adelard of Bath\n\nAdelard of Bath (; 1080 1152 AD) was a 12th-century English natural philosopher. He is known both for his original works and for translating many important Arabic and Greek scientific works of astrology, astronomy, philosophy and mathematics into Latin from Arabic versions, which were then introduced to Western Europe. He is known as one of the first to introduce the Arabic numeral system to Europe. He stands at the convergence of three intellectual schools: the traditional learning of French schools, the Greek culture of Southern Italy, and the Arabic science of the East.\n\nGiven the period when he was alive, Adelard's biography is incomplete in places and leaves some aspects open to interpretation. As a result, much of what is ascribed to Adelard is a product of his own testimony. As his name suggests, he was born in the Roman English city of Bath but how he lived is not entirely known. Despite his extensive travels, by the end of his life he had returned to Bath, where he died. Scholars are hesitant to ascribe definitive parents to the philosopher but Fastred, a tenant of the Bishop of Wells, is mostly plausibly identified as this figure. His name (Adelard) is of Anglo-Saxon origin, which would have placed him in the subordinate class, status wise, in 11th-century England. It is believed that he left England toward the end of the 11th century for Tours, likely on the advice of Bishop John de Villula, who had moved the seat of his bishopric from Wells to Bath in 1090. During his studies in Tours, an anonymous \"wise man of Tours\" inspired Adelard with his interest in astronomy to study the science. Adelard later taught for a time at Laon, leaving Laon for travel no later than 1109. After leaving Laon, he travelled to Southern Italy and Sicily no later than 1116.\n\nAdelard also travelled extensively throughout the \"lands of the Crusades\": Greece, West Asia, Sicily, Spain, Tarsus, Antioch and potentially Palestine. The time spent in these areas would help explain his fascination with mathematics and his access to Arabic scholars. By 1126, Adelard returned to the West with the intention of spreading the knowledge he had gained about Arab astronomy and geometry to the Latin world. One aspect of particular interest with respect to Adelard, his teachings, and the time period he grew up, was the relation to the Crusades. This time of remarkable transition marked an opportunity for someone to gain valuable influence over the evolution of human history. While the Crusades offered little in the way of a victor, Adelard's non-discriminatory scholarly work inspired him to bring back to England many ancient texts and new questions that would later give rise to an English Renaissance. Again, given the 11th-century time period that Adelard was alive, it was understandably difficult for Adelard to have achieved his educational pursuits. In the absence of a printing press and given the weak public literacy rate, books were rare items in medieval Europe—generally held only by royal courts or Catholic monastic communities (Kraye, \"et al.\" 1987). Fittingly, Adelard studied with monks at the Benedictine Monastery at Bath Cathedral.\n\nAmong Adelard of Bath's original works is a trio of dialogues, written to mimic the Platonic style, or correspondences with his nephew. The earliest of these is \"De Eodem et Diverso (On the Same and the Different)\". It is written in the style of a protreptic, or an exhortation to the study of philosophy. The work is modelled on Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\", evident in Adelard's vocabulary and phraseology. It is believed to have been written near Tours after he had already travelled, though there is no indication that he had travelled past Southern Italy and Sicily at the time of writing. The work takes the form of a dramatic dialogue between Philocosmia, who advocates worldly pleasures, and Philosophia, whose defence of scholarship leads into a summary of the seven liberal arts. Underlining the entire work is the contrast between Philocosmia's \"res\" (perceptible reality), and Philosophia's \"verba\" (mental concepts). Each section of the liberal arts is divided into two parts. Presented first is a description of the allegorical figure representing the art, in which the importance of that art is indicated, followed by a summary of the doctrines of that art, as told by the allegorical figure who is presented as the founder or main proponent of the particular art.\n\nThe second of this trio, and arguably Adelard's most significant contribution, was his \"Questiones Naturales\" or \"Questions on Natural Science\". It can be dated between 1107 and 1133 as, in the text, Adelard himself mentions that seven years have passed since his lecturing in schools at Laon. He chooses to present this work as a forum for Arabic learning, referring often to his experiences in Antioch. He sets out seventy-six questions, in the form of a Platonic dialogue about meteorology and natural science. It was used heavily in schools into and beyond the 13th century but the teaching on natural things would ultimately be superseded by Aristotle's writing. The text is broken up into three parts: \"On Plants and Brute Animals\", \"On Man\" and \"On Earth, Water, Air, and Fire\". Two of the more specific features associated with this text are (1) a preference for reason over authority in matters of science and nature (in other words, seeking solutions via reason and logic rather than through faith) and (2) the use of the literary device of invoking Arab teachings when presenting very controversial topics (i.e. that brute animals may possess knowledge and souls) Adelard didn't think that the use of reason to seek knowledge was in any way contradictory with Christian faith in God. The soul is a large part of the dialogue in this text as \"On Man\" discusses a corporeal soul in man, while the final section elaborates on the incorporeal soul of elements and animals. \"Questiones Naturales\" appears to have been an immediate success as it was copied on both sides of the English Channel and was even presented in a \"pocket-book\" format, suggesting that it was meant to be carried around.\n\nThe final section in his trilogy is a treatise on hawking called \"De Avibus Tractatus (Treatise on Birds)\". It is a medical text that addresses disease from head-to-toe. While it has been argued that this treatise was not widely distributed, an investigation of later Latin and French treatises reveals a number of excerpts from Adelard's work.\n\nThe remainder of Adelard's original works did not involve the persona of his nephew. He wrote a treatise on the use of the abacus called \"Regulae Abaci\", which was likely written very early in his career because it shows no trace of Arab influence. This treatise is believed to be proof that Adelard was connected to the Exchequer table that was used for monetary calculations in the medieval period. Further evidence for this can be found in the Pipe Roll of Henry I, which shows that he had received a discharge from the murder fine (a fine levied on inhabitants of a certain area based on the murder of a Norman that occurred in a generally accessible field in that same area) levied on the community of Wiltshire in 1130, though there is no other proof for this fact. The work that Adelard of Bath is known for in the Latin world is his translation of the astronomical tables of al-Khwarizmi, the first widely accessible Latin translation of the Islamic ideas about algebra. In the Middle Ages he was known for his rediscovery and teaching of geometry, earning his reputation when he made the first full translation of Euclid's \"Elements\" and began the process of interpreting the text for a Western audience.\n\nWhen Adelard's influence on the study of philosophy is considered, it is clear that his ideas most notably manifested in the later works of Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. While his work in natural philosophy is probably overshadowed by Aristotle, it still helped lay the foundations for much of the progress that was made in the later centuries. His work surrounding Euclid's \"Elements\", for example, was of great help in providing training that would help future scholars understand the relationships between demonstrative and geometrical proofs. While his original writings demonstrate that he had a sincere passion for the seven liberal arts (grammar, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, geometry, music, and astronomy), his work in \"Quaestiones naturales\" illustrated a more encompassing dedication to subjects such as physics, the natural sciences, and possibly even metaphysics. His influence is also evident in \"De philosophia mundi\" by William of Conches, Hugh of Saint Victor, and Isaac of Stella's \"Letters to Alcher on the Soul\". He introduced algebra to the Latin world and his commentaries in Version III of Euclid's \"Elements\" were extremely influential in the 13th century. Adelard also displays original thought of a scientific bent, raising the question of the shape of the Earth (he believed it round) and the question of how it remains stationary in space, and also the interesting question of how far a rock would fall if a hole were drilled through the Earth and a rock dropped through it, see center of gravity.\nCampanus of Novara probably had access to Adelard's translation of \"Elements\", and it is Campanus' edition that was first published in Venice in 1482 after the invention of the printing press. It became the chief textbook of the mathematical schools of Western Europe until the 16th century.\n\n\n\n"}

Cavanagh argues against the conventional understanding of equal opportunity, in particular both meritocracy and most substantial interpretations of equality, including the idea of ‘equal life chances’. Instead, he argues for a more limited approach of trying to eliminate specific kinds of discrimination (including race discrimination), together with trying to provide enough opportunities, and help to access them, such that most people have some degree of control over their lives.\n\nThe book caused some controversy when the author was appointed as an adviser to then Labour Minister David Blunkett when it was revealed that the book argued that it was sometimes rational (in an economic sense) for white employers to discriminate against black applicants which in some eyes amounted to effectively condoning racial discrimination.\n\nThis led to widespread calls for Cavanagh to be sacked, with questions tabled in Parliament, and the affair rumbled on for a few days. \"The Guardian\"'s letters page carried a balance of letters for and against Cavanagh.\n\nThe book received positive reviews in the \"Times Educational Supplement\" \"The Spectator\", and in academic journals including \"Ethics\", \"Notre Dame Philosophical Review\", \"Theory and Research in Education\" and \"Contemporary Political Theory\".\n\nOther reviews were more mixed, including the \"London Review of Books\", \"The Independent\", \"Philosophical Books\" and \"Political Studies Review\" and \"Utilitas\", the latter two arguing that the work does not adequately engage other scholarly literature relating to equality of opportunity by authors such as Joel Feinberg or George Sher.\n"}

After matriculating in 1971 from the Paul Roos Gymnasium School in Stellenbosch, South Africa, Van Niekerk obtained a BA degree (1974), BA Honours in Philosophy (1976), MA in Philosophy (1980), BTh (1978) and a Licentiate in Theology (1979), all cum laude, from Stellenbosch University. He also obtained his DPhil in 1983. The title of his MA thesis was, \"The Limits of Critical Reason: a Critical Inquiry of the Rationality Model of Critical Rationalism\". His doctoral dissertation was entitled: \"Analogy and Theology: A Critical-Philosophical Investigation of Analogy Theories about the Meaning of Theological Language\". Both dissertations were supervised by Prof Hennie Rossouw.\n\nVan Niekerk was awarded the Chancellor's Medal for the best final year student from Stellenbosch University in 1980 for his MA. In 1980, he was appointed as lecturer in Philosophy at the Stellenbosch University. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1985 and then awarded a professorship in 1989. He created the Centre for Applied Ethics, and the Unit for Bioethics within this centre, at the same university and has served as director of both since their inception in 1990. Van Niekerk served as chair of the Department of Philosophy at Stellenbosch University from 1990–2001 and again from 2006-2013. In 2014 he was appointed as one of a select group of distinguished professors at Stellenbosch University. In total, he has written 18 books, 140 journal articles and book chapters, and approximately 180 popular articles. He has also supervised 21 completed doctoral dissertations and 72 Master's theses.\n\nHis research fields include bioethics, philosophy of religion and philosophy of the social sciences (with an emphasis upon hermeneutic approaches). Van Niekerk is one of the pioneers of the establishment of bioethics as an academic discipline in South Africa. In 1996 he was largely responsible for the introduction of the MPhil degree in Applied Ethics at Stellenbosch University, a program which was the first and still is the best known of its kind in South Africa. As a young lecturer, Van Niekerk was at the forefront of political and intellectual debate and a vehement critic of the apartheid regime in South Africa. In 2011 he was assaulted in his office at the university by a member of a reactionary right wing movement as a result of an article of his that was published in a national newspaper. The individual in question had, by his own admission, never read the article and thus applied a sensationalised misinformed interpretation of van Niekerk's argument. The attacker was found guilty of assault and the sentencing, provoked widespread national and international media interest.\n\nIn 1995, van Niekerk was awarded the Stals Prize for Philosophy by the South African Academy for Science and Art. From 1989 to 2000 he was editor of the internationally accredited South African Journal of Philosophy. He served from 2003 to 2007 as Senate Representative on the Council of Stellenbosch University. During that time, he also served as chairperson of the Language Committee - a position which brought about the necessity of him playing a prominent role in the Stellenbosch language debate which has raged since about 2004. From 2007 to 2012 he was a director of the International Association of Bioethics. He was also one of the founding members of the Ethics Institute of South Africa (EthicsSA), initially serving on its board from 2000 and as its chairman since 2003. From 2001 to 2013, van Niekerk served as a member of the Ethics Committee of the South African Medical Research Council, and as the chairperson of the Stellenbosch University's Senate's Ethics Committee since 2009. In 2013, he was appointed by the South African Minister of Health as a member of the National Health Research Ethics Council (NHREC), the highest policy making body for research ethics in South Africa. He has a B2 rating (undisputed international recognition) as a researcher with the National Research Foundation of South Africa, and in 2011 and 2012 was also convener of the NRF panel research ratings in Philosophy and Political Science.\n\n1987.

Heiligenkruez\"), colloquially referred to as Hochschule Heiligenkreuz, is a private, Roman Catholic pontifical university located in Heiligenkreuz, Austria. Founded in 1802 by the Cistercian monks of Heiligenkreuz Abbey as a seminary, for much of the 19th century, the college remained very small, with less than 20 seminarians and several Cistercian instructors. During the late 19th century and 20th-century, the college's profile grew, and more students arrived, made up of Cistercians, as well as diocesan and religious seminarians. In 1978, it earned university status, and Pope Benedict XVI named it a pontifical university upon his visit in 2007.\n\nThe university's campus is located in a group of buildings located at Heiligenkruez Abbey, sharing space with the monastery and a seminary. As of 2016, the university enrolled 295 students, including 43 Cistercians, 40 from other religious institutes, and 75 diocesan seminarians, the rest being lay men and women. It is the only university administered by the Cistercian Order, and the only theological college in Austria, and the largest educational institution for priests and religious in the German-speaking world.\n\nTheological education has been present at Heiligenkreuz Abbey since the Middle Ages. Since 1802, a state-accredited and Church-recognized institution of higher education has operated, originally organized as a seminary to train Cistercian priests from the Zwettl, Heiligenkreuz, Neukloster, and Lilienfeld abbeys, all located in Lower Austria.\n\nFor much of the 19th century, the college remained small, with enrollment never more than 20. In the late 19th century, thanks to both political as well as economic changes, the college grew in prestige and influence. Instead of having to teach from state-approved curriculum, the Cistercian professors enjoyed more intellectual independence. In addition, the professors would now receive degrees from universities in Vienna, Austria, Tübingen, Germany, and Rome. Despite these changes, enrollment remained low.\n\nAfter Vatican II, enrollment grew rapidly after the college, then known by its Latin name, Institutum Theologicum, came to the attention of the Bishop of Regensburg, Rudolf Graber. He wanted his seminarians to experience life in a religious community before coming diocesan priests, so he sent them to Heiligenkreuz. Soon, other bishops and leaders of other religious orders began sending their own seminarians to be educated there. By 1976, as the college was offering graduate degrees and opening enrollment to lay students, it was granted university status by the Austrian government.\n\nIn May 2002, professors and students made a trip to Rome, where they were received in a papal audience by Pope John Paul II.\n\nIn 2007, Pope Benedict XVI visited the university. On 28 January, the feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas, Benedict raised the college to the rank of pontifical university. He praised the university for its combination of theology and spirituality and described it as a \"prominent place of study.\"\n\nThe university is located in Heiligenkreuz, Lower Austria, Austria, in a complex of buildings located on the Heiligenkreuz Abbey property.\n\nThe Grand Chancellor of the university is the abbot of Heiligenkreuz Abbey. The current abbot and chancellor is Maximillian Heim, OCist, since 2011. The Rector is the de facto leader of university, with more day-to-day involvement in administration. The current rector is Karl Wallner, OCist. The Vice Rector, as well as much of the teaching body, are Cistercians from Heiligenkreuz Abbey.\n\nThe university is organized into twelve 'institutes' or departments. They are as follows:\n\nStudium Generale is a curriculum in which the Pope Benedict XVI University partners with the International Theological Institute in Trumau. The German/English-language curriculum, which has been offered since 2015, is a one-year course that offers an overview of philosophy, theology, ethics, economics, law, history, spirituality, and art, all centered around the Catholic intellectual tradition. Classes are split between the two institutions, with two-thirds of classes being held in Trumai and the other third in Heiligenkreuz. Students reside at the International Theological Institute campus.\n\nIn the 2015–2016 academic year, the university had 295 students. Cistercian students numbered 43, students from other religious orders numbered 40, there were 75 diocesan seminarians, and the rest were lay men and women.\n\nSeminarians and students from religious orders reside in Heiligenkreuz Abbey. Other seminarians live at the Leopoldinum Seminary, also located at the monastery. The only traditional dormitory is the Pope John Paul II Student House, home to both lay and religious male students. St. Joseph of Carmel Other students, especially non-clergy students, find off-campus housing in the town of Heiligenkreuz.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "564568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=564568", "title": "Bernard Mandeville", "text": "Bernard Mandeville\n\nBernard Mandeville, or Bernard de Mandeville (; 15 November 1670 – 21 January 1733), was an Anglo-Dutch philosopher, political economist and satirist. Born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, he lived most of his life in England and used English for most of his published works. He became famous for \"The Fable of the Bees\".\n\nMandeville was born on 15 November 1670, at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where his father was a prominent physician. On leaving the Erasmus school at Rotterdam he showed his ability by an \"Oratio scholastica de medicina\" (1685), and at Leiden University in 1689 he produced the thesis \"De brutorum operationibus\", in which he advocated the Cartesian theory of automatism among animals. In 1691 he took his medical degree, pronouncing an inaugural disputation, \"De chylosi vitiata\". He moved to England to learn the language, and succeeded so remarkably that many refused to believe he was a foreigner. His father had been banished from Rotterdam in 1693 for involvement in the Costerman tax riots on 5 October 1690; Bernard himself may well have been involved.\n\nAs a physician Mandeville was well respected and his literary works were successful as well. His conversational abilities won him the friendship of Lord Macclesfield (chief justice 1710–1718), who introduced him to Joseph Addison, described by Mandeville as \"a parson in a tye-wig.\" He died of influenza on 21 January 1733 at Hackney, aged 62.\n\nThere is a surviving image of Mandeville but many details of his life still have to be researched. Although the name Mandeville suggests a French (possibly Huguenot) origin, his ancestors had lived in the Netherlands since at least the 16th century.\n\nIn 1705 he published a poem under the title \"The Grumbling Hive, or Knaves Turn'd Honest\" (two hundred doggerel couplets). In 1714 it was republished as an integral part of the \"Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits\", consisting of a prose commentary, called \"Remarks\", and an essay, \"An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue\". In 1723 a later edition appeared, including \"An Essay on Charity and Charity Schools\", and \"A Search into the Nature of Society\". It was vigorously combatted by, among others, Bishop Berkeley and William Law, author of \"The Serious Call\", and in 1729 was made the subject of a prosecution for its immoral tendency. This essay criticised the charity schools, designed to educate the poor and, in doing so, instil virtue in them. Mandeville disagreed with the idea that education adds virtue because he did not believe that evil desires existed only in the poor, but rather he saw the educated and wealthy as much more crafty. Mandeville also believed that educating the poor increased their desires for material things, defeating the purpose of the school and making it more difficult to provide for them.\n\nThe book was primarily written as a political satire on the state of England in 1705, when the Tories were accusing John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and the ministry of advocating the War of the Spanish Succession for personal reasons.\n\nIn \"The Grumbling Hive\" Mandeville describes a bee community thriving until the bees are suddenly made honest and virtuous. Without their desire for personal gain their economy collapses and the remaining bees go to live simple lives in a hollow tree, thus implying that without private vices there exists no public benefit.\n\nThe edition of 1723 was presented as a nuisance by the Grand Jury of Middlesex, was denounced in the \"London Journal\" by \"Theophilus Philo-Britannus,\" and was attacked by many writers, notably by Archibald Campbell (1691–1756) of St Andrews in his \"Aretelogia\" (published as his own by Alexander Innes in 1728; afterwards by Campbell, under his own name, in 1733, as \"Enquiry into the Original of Moral Virtue\"). The \"Fable\" was reprinted in 1729, a ninth edition appeared in 1755, and it has often been reprinted in more recent times. Berkeley attacked it in the second dialogue of the \"Alciphron\" (1732) and John Brown criticised him in his \"Essay upon Shaftesbury's Characteristics\" (1751). Francis Hutcheson also denounced Mandeville, initially declaring \"The Fable\" to be \"unanswerable\"―that is, too absurd for comment. Hutcheson argued in response that pleasure consisted in \"affection to fellow creatures\", and not the hedonistic pursuit of bodily pleasures. He also disagreed with Mandeville's notion of luxury, which he believed depended on too austere a notion of virtue.\n\nMandeville's philosophy gave great offence at the time, and has always been stigmatised as false, cynical and degrading. His main thesis is that the actions of men cannot be divided into lower and higher. The higher life of man is a mere fiction introduced by philosophers and rulers to simplify government and the relations of society. In fact, virtue (which he defined as \"every performance by which man, contrary to the impulse of nature, should endeavour the benefit of others, or the conquest of his own passions, out of a rational ambition of being good\") is actually detrimental to the state in its commercial and intellectual progress. This is because it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital (economics) in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress.\n\nMandeville concluded that vice, at variance with the \"Christian virtues\" of his time, was a necessary condition for economic prosperity. His viewpoint is more severe when juxtaposed to Adam Smith's. Both Smith and Mandeville believed that individuals' collective actions bring about a public benefit. However, what sets his philosophy apart from Smith's is his catalyst to that public benefit. Smith believed in a virtuous self-interest which results in invisible co-operation. For the most part, Smith saw no need for a guide to garner that public benefit. On the other hand, Mandeville believed it was vicious greed which led to invisible co-operation if properly channelled. Mandeville's qualification of proper channelling further parts his philosophy from Smith's \"laissez-faire\" attitude. Essentially, Mandeville called for politicians to ensure that the passions of man would result in a public benefit. It was his stated belief in the \"Fable of the Bees\" that \"Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits\".\n\nIn the \"Fable\" he shows a society possessed of all the virtues \"blest with content and honesty,\" falling into apathy and utterly paralysed. The absence of self-love (cf. Hobbes) is the death of progress. The so-called higher virtues are mere hypocrisy, and arise from the selfish desire to be superior to the brutes. \"The moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride.\" Similarly he arrives at the great paradox that \"private vices are public benefits\".\n\nAmong other things, Mandeville argues that the basest and vilest behaviours produce positive economic effects. A libertine, for example, is a vicious character, and yet his spending will employ tailors, servants, perfumers, cooks, prostitutes. These persons, in turn, will employ bakers, carpenters, and the like. Therefore, the rapaciousness and violence of the base passions of the libertine benefit society in general. Similar satirical arguments were made by the Restoration and Augustan satirists. A famous example is Mandeville's \"Modest Defence of Publick Stews,\" which argued for the introduction of public, state-controlled brothels. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and mentions e.g. the clitoris as center of the female sexual pleasure. Jonathan Swift's 1729 satire A Modest Proposal is probably an allusion to Mandeville's title.\n\nMandeville was an early describer of the division of labour, and Adam Smith makes use of some of his examples.\nWhile the author probably had no intention of subverting morality, his views of human nature were seen by his critics as cynical and degraded. Another of his works, \"A Search into the Nature of Society\" (1723), appended to the later versions of the \"Fable\", also startled the public mind, which his last works, \"Free Thoughts on Religion\" (1720) and \"An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour and the Usefulness of Christianity\" (1732) did little to reassure. The work in which he approximates most nearly to modern views is his account of the origin of society. His \"a priori\" theories should be compared with the jurist Henry Maine's historical inquiries (\"Ancient Law\"). He endeavours to show that all social laws are the crystallised results of selfish aggrandizement and protective alliances among the weak. Denying any form of moral sense or conscience, he regards all the social virtues as evolved from the instinct for self-preservation, the give-and-take arrangements between the partners in a defensive and offensive alliance, and the feelings of pride and vanity artificially fed by politicians, as an antidote to dissension and chaos.\n\nMandeville's ironic paradoxes are interesting mainly as a criticism of the \"amiable\" idealism of Shaftesbury, and in comparison with the serious egoistic systems of Hobbes and Helvétius. \n\nMandeville's ideas about society and politics were praised by Friedrich Hayek, a proponent of Austrian economics, in his book \"Law, Legislation and Liberty\".\n\n\nOther works attributed, wrongly, to him are \"The World Unmasked\" (1736) and \"Zoologia medicinalis hibernica\" (1744).\n\n\n\n\n"}

All of these pre-Qin texts were written in classical Chinese. All three canons are collectively known as the classics ( ,  , \"jīng\",  \"warp\").\n\nChinese classic texts may more broadly refer to texts written either in vernacular Chinese or in the classical Chinese that was current until the fall of the last imperial dynasty, the Qing, in 1912. These can include \"shi\" (, historical works), \"zi\" (, philosophical works belonging to schools of thought other than the Confucian but also including works on agriculture, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, divination, art criticism, and other miscellaneous writings) and \"ji\" (, literary works) as well as \"jing (Chinese medicine)\".\n\nIn the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Four Books and Five Classics were the subject of mandatory study by those Confucian scholars who wished to take the imperial exams to become government officials. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the literati (or, in some periods, even a military officer) without having memorized them. Generally, children first memorized the Chinese characters of the \"Three Character Classic\" and the \"Hundred Family Surnames\" and then went on to memorize the other classics. The literate elite therefore shared a common culture and set of values.\n\nScholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the burning of the books during the fall of the Qin dynasty, when many of the original pre-Qin texts were lost.\n\nIt is often difficult or impossible to precisely date pre-Qin works beyond their being \"pre-Qin\", a period of 1000 years. Information in ancient China was often passed down orally for generations before being written down, so the order of composition of the texts need not be the same as that of their attributed \"authors\".\n\nThe below list is therefore organized in the order found in the Siku Quanshu, the imperial library of the Qing dynasty. The Siku classifies all works into 4 top-level branches: the Confucian Classics and their secondary literature; history; philosophy; and poetry. There are sub-categories within each branch, but due to the small number of pre-Qin works in the Classics, History and Poetry branches, the sub-categories are only reproduced for the Philosophy branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13627811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13627811", "title": "Dystheism", "text": "Dystheism\n\nDystheism (from Greek δυσ- \"dys-\", \"bad\" and θεός theos, \"god\"), is the belief that a god, goddess, or singular God is not wholly good (eutheism) as is commonly believed (such as in the monotheistic religions of Christianity and Judaism), and is possibly evil. Definitions of the term somewhat vary, with one author defining it as \"where God decides to become malevolent\". The broad theme of dystheism has existed for millennia, as shown by trickster gods found in polytheistic belief systems and by the view of the God of the Old Testament through a nonreligious lens as angry, vengeful and smiting. The modern concept dates back many decades, with the Victorian era figure Algernon Charles Swinburne writing in his work \"Anactoria\" about the ancient Greek poet Sappho and her lover Anactoria in explicitly dystheistic imagery that includes cannibalism and sadomasochism.\n\nThe concept has been used frequently in popular culture and is a part of several religious traditions in the world. Trickster gods found in polytheistic belief systems often have a dystheistic nature. One example is Eshu, a trickster god from Yoruba mythology who deliberately fostered violence between groups of people for his own amusement, saying that \"causing strife is my greatest joy.\" Another example is the Norse Loki, though Odin has these qualities as well. Zoroastrianism involves belief in an ongoing struggle between a creator god of goodness (Ahura Mazda) and a destroying god of hatred (Angra Mainyu), neither of which are omnipotent, which is a form of dualistic cosmology. The Greek god Ares, depending on time and region, was associated with all the horrors of war.\n\nDystheists may themselves be theists or atheists, and in the case of either, concerning the nature of the God of Abrahamic faiths, will assert that God is not good, and is possibly, although not necessarily, malevolent, particularly (but not exclusively) to those who do not wish to follow that faith. For example, in his \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\" (1741), Jonathan Edwards, a devout theist, describes a God full of vengeful rage and contempt, seemingly different from one with Christ-like omnibenevolence. Such absence of omnibenevolence is one kind of theist counterargument to the notion that the problem of evil poses any great logical challenge to theism.\n\nOne particular view of dystheism, an atheistic approach, is summarized by the prominent revolutionary philosopher Mikhail Bakunin, who wrote in \"God and the State\" that \"if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him\". Bakunin argued that, as a \"jealous lover of human liberty, and deeming it the absolute condition of all that we admire and respect in humanity\", the \"idea of God\" constituted of metaphysical oppression of the idea of human choice. Said argument is an inversion of Voltaire's phrase \"If God did not exist, it would be necessary for man to invent Him\".\n\nPolitical theorist and activist Thomas Paine similarly wrote in \"The Age of Reason\", \"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God.\" He added, \"It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.\" Unlike Bakunin, however, Paine's condemnation of the purported nature of the divine from his time didn't extent to outright atheism and disbelief in all spirituality, Paine stating that he accepted the deistic notion of an almighty mover behind all things.\n\nDystheism as a concept, although often not labeled as such, has been referred to in many aspects of popular culture. As stated before, related ideas date back many decades, with the Victorian era figure Algernon Charles Swinburne writing in his work \"Anactoria\" about the ancient Greek poet Sappho and her lover Anactoria in explicitly dystheistic imagery that includes cannibalism and sadomasochism. More recent examples include the popular \"Star Trek\" television series. Fictional character Worf claims that his race, the Klingons, have no gods, because they killed them centuries ago for being \"more trouble than they were worth.\"\n\nProminent American singer-songwriter Randy Newman expresses a dystheistic worldview in his song \"He Gives Us All His Love\", a piano based ballad with sardonic lyrics describing how God has created a suffering world with its \"babies crying\" and \"old folks dying\" and smiles at it while doing nothing to help those unfortunate people. The track has appeared in both his 1972 album \"Sail Away\" and his 2011 album \"Original Album Series\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "253661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253661", "title": "Edition (printmaking)", "text": "Edition (printmaking)\n\nIn printmaking, an edition is a number of prints struck from one plate, usually at the same time. This may be a \"limited edition\", with a fixed number of impressions produced on the understanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an \"open edition\" limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the plate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed by the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of that impression and the total edition size.\n\nAn important and often confused distinction is that between editions of original prints, produced in the same medium as the artist worked (e.g., etching, or lithography), and reproduction prints (or paintings), which are photographic reproductions of the original work, essentially in the same category as a picture in a book or magazine, though better printed and on better paper. These may be marketed as \"limited editions\" with investment potential (which is rarely realized), and even signed and numbered by the artist. Some knowledge is often required to tell the difference.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the development of printmaking was the desire of artists to make more money from their work by selling multiple copies; printmaking satisfies this motive. The production of multiple copies also tends to reduce production costs and market price when compared to a single or unique image. Until the 19th century, in the period of the Old master print the concept of an edition did not really apply to prints, unlike books. Prints were often run off as demand allowed, and often worn-out plates were reworked by the original artist or another, to produce a new state. The art market attempts to distinguish between \"lifetime impressions\" and \"late impressions\", which were produced after the death of the artist. This can be done to some extent by the study of the paper involved, and its watermark, and the condition of the plate as revealed by the printed image. But it remains a difficult area. \n\nThe aquatints of Goya, which are done in a technique that wears out quickly on the plate, were the first important prints to be published initially in limited editions, which however were not signed or numbered. In fact the plates survived, and since Goya's death several further editions have been published, showing a progressive and drastic decline in quality of the image, despite some rework. Because of this and other cases, \"posthumous editions\" produced after the death of an artist, and obviously not signed by him, are usually far less sought after. The plates of later prints are often \"cancelled\" by defacing the image, with a couple of impressions of the cancelled plate taken to document it. This is now expected by collectors and investors, who want the prints they buy to retain their value.\n\nPrints by artists today may potentially retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) because they are created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce because the number of multiples is limited. In Rembrandt's time, the limit on the size of an edition was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.\n\nToday, artists will sometimes refer to a print as a \"one-off,\" meaning that the artist has made a unique print and no reproductions of it from the original matrix, often not even a proof. In this category one sometimes finds monotypes, monoprints, collagraphs, altered prints with collage or chine colle additions, or even hand-colored prints. There remain artists who are strong advocates of \"artist's prints\" which are conceived, printed, signed, and given the edition number 1/1 by the artist. One contemporary printmaker says that she believes that \"there is a natural sequence of actions and thoughts which cannot be approximated by the substitution of an artist/printer collaboration unless the artist is truly involved with the printer or assistant in every step of the decision-making and mark-making processes.\" \n\nBecause of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.\n\nIn later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., \"15/30\" for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In monotyping, a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked \"unique\". Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating intaglio images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal. \n\nThe conventions for numbering prints are well-established, but other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. Artist's proofs are marked \"A. P.\" or \"P/A\", sometimes E. A. or E. d'A. (épreuve d'artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked \"unique\"; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked \"H. C.\" or \"H/C\", meaning \"hors de commerce\", not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist's Proofs. The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked \"P. P.\" Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as \"bon à tirer\" or \"BAT\" (\"good to print\" in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.\n\nProfessional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several artist's proof copies, including a \"bon a tirer\" print and then one unique copy designated as a \"one-off\" or \"1/1\" or \"one/off\".\n\nCalifornia became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the \"California Print Law\" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the \"Georgia Print Law\". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states.\n\nThe Georgia Print Law written by (former) State Representative Chesley V. Morton, became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law. The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "307139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307139", "title": "Empirical evidence", "text": "Empirical evidence\n\nEmpirical evidence is the information received by means of the senses, particularly by observation and documentation of patterns and behavior through experimentation. The term comes from the Greek word for experience, ἐμπειρία (\"empeiría\"). \n\nAfter Immanuel Kant, in philosophy, it is common to call the knowledge gained \"\"a posteriori\" knowledge\" (in contrast to \"a priori\" knowledge).\n\nEmpirical evidence is information that verifies the truth (which accurately corresponds to reality) or falsity (inaccuracy) of a claim. In the empiricist view, one can claim to have knowledge only when based on empirical evidence (although some empiricists believe that there are other ways of gaining knowledge). This stands in contrast to the rationalist view under which reason or reflection alone is considered evidence for the truth or falsity of some propositions. Empirical evidence is information acquired by observation or experimentation. This data is recorded and analyzed by scientists. This is the primary source of empirical evidence. Secondary sources describe, discuss, interpret, comment upon, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and process primary sources. Secondary source materials can be articles in newspapers or popular magazines, book or movie reviews, or articles found in scholarly journals that discuss or evaluate someone else's original research.\n\nEmpirical evidence may be synonymous with the outcome of an experiment. In this regard, an empirical result is a unified confirmation. In this context, the term \"semi-empirical\" is used for qualifying theoretical methods that use, in part, basic axioms or postulated scientific laws and experimental results. Such methods are opposed to theoretical \"ab initio\" methods, which are purely deductive and based on first principles.\n\nIn science, empirical evidence is required for a hypothesis to gain acceptance in the scientific community. Normally, this validation is achieved by the scientific method of forming a hypothesis, experimental design, peer review, reproduction of results, conference presentation, and journal publication. This requires rigorous communication of hypothesis (usually expressed in mathematics), experimental constraints and controls (expressed necessarily in terms of standard experimental apparatus), and a common understanding of measurement.\n\nStatements and arguments depending on empirical evidence are often referred to as \"a posteriori\" (\"following experience\") as distinguished from \"a priori\" (preceding it). \"A priori\" knowledge or justification is independent of experience (for example \"All bachelors are unmarried\"), whereas \"a posteriori\" knowledge or justification is dependent on experience or empirical evidence (for example \"Some bachelors are very happy\"). The notion that the distinction between \"a posteriori\" and \"a priori\" is tantamount to the distinction between empirical and non-empirical knowledge comes from Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason.\"\n\nThe standard positivist view of empirically acquired information has been that observation, experience, and experiment serve as neutral arbiters between competing theories. However, since the 1960s, a persistent critique most associated with Thomas Kuhn, has argued that these methods are influenced by prior beliefs and experiences. Consequently, it cannot be expected that two scientists when observing, experiencing, or experimenting on the same event will make the same theory-neutral observations. The role of observation as a theory-neutral arbiter may not be possible. Theory-dependence of observation means that, even if there were agreed methods of inference and interpretation, scientists may still disagree on the nature of empirical data.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9556567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9556567", "title": "Ethics of cloning", "text": "Ethics of cloning\n\nIn bioethics, the ethics of cloning refers to a variety of ethical positions regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning. While many of these views are religious in origin, some of the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well. Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.\n\nAdvocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants, to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs, and to stave off the effects of aging. Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology.\n\nOpponents of cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe, that it could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested), and have concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.\n\nReligious groups are divided, with some opposing the technology as usurping God's place and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits.\n\nCloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die, and while food from cloned animals has been approved by the US FDA, its use is opposed by some other groups concerned about food safety.\n\nThe various forms of cloning, particularly human cloning, are controversial. There have been numerous demands for all progress in the human cloning field to be halted. Most scientific, governmental and religious organizations oppose reproductive cloning. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and other scientific organizations have made public statements suggesting that human reproductive cloning be banned until safety issues are resolved. Serious ethical concerns have been raised by the future possibility of harvesting organs from clones.\n\nAdvocates of human therapeutic cloning believe the practice could provide genetically identical cells for regenerative medicine, and tissues and organs for transplantation. Such cells, tissues, and organs would neither trigger an immune response nor require the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Both basic research and therapeutic development for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, as well as improvements in burn treatment and reconstructive and cosmetic surgery, are areas that might benefit from such new technology. One bioethicist, Jacob M. Appel of New York University, has gone so far as to argue that \"children cloned for therapeutic purposes\" such as \"to donate bone marrow to a sibling with leukemia\" may someday be viewed as heroes.\n\nProponents claim that human reproductive cloning also would produce benefits to couples who cannot otherwise procreate. In the early 2000s Severino Antinori and Panos Zavos stirred controversy when they publicly stated plans to create a fertility treatment that allows parents who are both infertile to have children with at least some of their DNA in their offspring.\n\nIn Aubrey de Grey's proposed SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence), one of the considered options to repair the cell depletion related to cellular senescence is to grow replacement tissues from stem cells harvested from a cloned embryo.\n\nThere are also ethical objections. Article 11 of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights asserts that the reproductive cloning of human beings is contrary to human dignity, that a potential life represented by the embryo is destroyed when embryonic cells are used, and there is a significant likelihood that cloned individuals would be biologically damaged, due to the inherent unreliability of cloning technology.\n\nEthicists have speculated on difficulties that might arise in a world where human clones exist. For example, human cloning might change the shape of family structure by complicating the role of parenting within a family of convoluted kinship relations. For example, a female DNA donor would be the clone's genetic twin, rather than mother, complicating the genetic and social relationships between mother and child as well as the relationships between other family members and the clone. In another example, there may be expectations that the cloned individuals would act identically to the human from which they were cloned, which could infringe on the right to self-determination.\n\nProponents of animal rights argue that non-human animals possess certain moral rights as living entities and should therefore be afforded the same ethical considerations as human beings. This would negate the exploitation of animals in scientific research on cloning, cloning used in food production, or as other resources for human use or consumption.\n\nReligious views of cloning are mixed.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, under the papacy of Benedict XVI, condemned the practice of human cloning, in the magisterial instruction Dignitas Personae, stating that it represents a \"grave offense to the dignity of that person as well as to the fundamental equality of all people.\" Many conservative Christian groups have opposed human cloning and the cloning of human embryos, since they believe that life begins at the moment of conception. Other Christian denominations such as the United Church of Christ do not believe a fertilized egg constitutes a living being, but still they oppose the cloning of embryonic cells. The World Council of Churches, representing nearly 400 Christian denominations worldwide, opposed cloning of both human embryos and whole humans in February 2006. The United Methodist Church opposed research and reproductive cloning in May 2000 and again in May 2004.\n\nThe prominent Qatari scholar Yusuf Al Qaradawi believes that cloning specific parts of the human body for medical purposes is not prohibited in Islam, but cloning the whole human body would not be permitted under any circumstances. On the issue of animal ethics he takes a more lenient position.\n\nThe late Grand Ayatollah of Lebanon, Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah did not see cloning as illegitimate. He also stressed that Islam encourages the pursuit of the sciences including medicine. The Ayatollah did however warn against cloning the entire human being for the purpose of harvesting his or her organs.\n\nSunni Muslims consider human cloning to be forbidden by Islam. The Islamic Fiqh Academy, in its Tenth Conference proceedings, which was convened in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the period from June 28, 1997 to July 3, 1997, issued a Fatwā stating that human cloning is haraam (sinful).\n\nJudaism does not equate life with conception and, though some question the wisdom of cloning, Orthodox rabbis generally find no firm reason in Jewish law and ethics to object to cloning. Liberal Jewish thinkers have cautioned against cloning, among other genetic engineering efforts, though some prize the potential medical advantages.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the consumption of meat and other products from cloned animals. Cloned-animal products were said to be indistinguishable from the non-cloned animals. Furthermore, companies would not be required to provide labels informing the consumer that the meat comes from a cloned animal. In 2007, some meat and dairy producers did propose a system to track all cloned animals as they move through the food chain, suggesting that a national database system integrated into the National Animal Identification System could eventually allow food labeling. However, as of 2013 no tracking system exists, and products from cloned animals are sold for human consumption in the United States.\n\nCritics have raised objections to the FDA's approval of cloned-animal products for human consumption, arguing that the FDA's research was inadequate, inappropriately limited, and of questionable scientific validity. Several consumer-advocate groups are working to encourage a tracking program that would allow consumers to become more aware of cloned-animal products within their food.\n\nA 2013 review noted that there is widespread misunderstanding about cloned and cattle, and found that cloned cattle that reached adulthood and entered the food supply were substantially equivalent to conventional cattle with respect to the quality of meat and milk, and with respect to their reproductive capability.\n\n"}

It can refer to facts and factuality, as in nineteenth-century positivism, but comes to mean that which resists explanation and interpretation in Wilhelm Dilthey and Neo-Kantianism. The Neo-Kantians contrasted facticity with ideality, as does Jürgen Habermas in \"Between Facts and Norms\" (\"Faktizität und Geltung\").\n\nGerman philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) discusses \"facticity\" as the \"thrownness\" (\"Geworfenheit\") of individual existence, which is to say we are \"thrown into the world.\" By this, he is not only referring to a brute fact, or the factuality of a concrete historical situation, e.g., \"born in the '80s.\" Facticity is something that already informs and has been taken up in existence, even if it is unnoticed or left unattended. As such, facticity is not something we come across and directly behold. In moods, for example, facticity has an enigmatic appearance, which involves both turning toward and away from it. For Heidegger, moods are conditions of thinking and willing to which they must in some way respond. The \"thrownness\" of human existence (or \"Dasein\") is accordingly disclosed through moods.\n\nIn the mid-20th Century works of French existentialists Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, facticity signifies all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited. For example, these may include the time and place of birth, a language, an environment, an individual's previous choices, as well as the inevitable prospect of their death. For example: currently, the situation of a person who is born without legs precludes their freedom to walk on the beach; if future medicine were to develop a method of growing new legs for that person, their facticity might no longer exclude this activity.\n\nIt is a term that takes on a more specialized meaning in 20th century continental philosophy, especially in phenomenology and existentialism, including Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Theodor Adorno. Recent philosophers such as Giorgio Agamben, Jean-Luc Nancy, and François Raffoul have taken up the notion of facticity in new ways.\n\nFacticity plays a key part in Quentin Meillassoux's philosophical project to challenge the thought-world relationship of correlationism. It is defined by him as “the absence of reason for any reality; in other words, the impossibility of providing an ultimate ground for the existence of any being.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1429582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1429582", "title": "Heterochrony", "text": "Heterochrony\n\nIn evolutionary developmental biology, heterochrony is a developmental change in the timing or rate of events, leading to changes in size and shape. It is contrasted with heterotopy, a change in spatial positioning of some process in the embryo, which can also create morphological innovation. Following the framework of Reilly \"et al\", heterochrony can be divided into intraspecific heterochrony that explains variation within a species, and interspecific heterochrony that explains developmental variation phylogenetically, in the timing or rate of events of a descendent species with respect to an ancestral species.\n\nThese changes all affect the start, end, rate, or timespan of a particular developmental process. The concept of heterochrony was introduced by Ernst Haeckel in 1875, and given its modern sense by Gavin de Beer in 1930.\n\nThe concept of heterochrony was introduced by the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel in 1875, where he used it to define deviations from recapitulation theory, which held that \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\". As Stephen Jay Gould pointed out, Haeckel's term is now used in a sense contrary to his coinage. He assumed that embryonic development (ontogeny) of \"higher\" animals recapitulated their ancestral development (phylogeny). This, in his view, necessarily compressed the earlier developmental stages, representing the ancestors, into a shorter time, meaning accelerated development. The ideal for Haeckel would be when the development of every part of an organism was thus accelerated, but he recognised that some organs could develop with displacements in position (heterotopy, another concept he originated) or time (heterochrony), as exceptions to his rule. He thus intended the term to mean a change in the timing of the embryonic development of one organ with respect to the rest of the same animal, whereas it is now used, following the work of the British evolutionary embryologist Gavin de Beer in 1930, to mean a change with respect to the development of the same organ in the animal's ancestors.\n\nIn 1928, the English embryologist Walter Garstang showed that tunicate larvae shared structures such as the notochord with adult vertebrates, and suggested that the vertebrates arose by paedomorphosis (neoteny) from such a larva.\n\nDe Beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book \"Embryos and Ancestors\", showing that evolution could occur by heterochrony, such as in paedomorphosis, the retention of juvenile features in the adult. De Beer argued that this enabled rapid evolutionary change, too brief to be recorded in the fossil record, and in effect explaining why apparent gaps were likely. \n\nHeterochrony can be divided into intraspecific and interspecific types.\n\nIntraspecific heterochrony means changes in the rate or timing of development within a species. For example, some individuals of the salamander species \"Ambystoma talpoideum\" delay the metamorphosis of the skull. Reilley \"et al\" argue we can define these variant individuals as \"paedotypic\" (with truncated development relative to the ancestral condition), \"peratypic\" (with extended development relative to the ancestral condition), or \"isotypic\" (reaching the same ancestral shape, but via a different mechanism).\n\nInterspecific heterochrony means differences in the rate or timing of a descendent species relative to its ancestor. This can result in either \"paedomophosis\" (truncating the ancestral ontogeny), \"peramorphosis\" (extending past the ancestral ontogeny), or \"isomorphosis\" (reaching the same ancestral state via a different mechanism).\n\nThere are three major mechanisms of heterochrony, each of which can change in either of two directions, giving six types of perturbations, which can be combined in various ways. These ultimately result in extended, shifted, or truncated development of a particular process, such as the action of a single toolkit gene, relative to the ancestral condition or to other conspecifics, depending on whether inter- or intraspecific heterochrony is the focus. Identifying which of the six perturbations is occurring is critical in identifying the actual underlying mechanism driving peramorphosis or paedomorphosis.\n\n\nA dramatic illustration of how acceleration can change a body plan is seen in snakes. Where a typical vertebrate like a mouse has only around 60 vertebrae, snakes have between around 150 to 400, giving them extremely long spinal columns and enabling their sinuous locomotion. Snake embryos achieve this by accelerating their system for creating somites (body segments), which relies on an oscillator. The oscillator clock runs some four times faster in snake than in mouse embryos, initially creating very thin somites. These expand to adopt a typical vertebrate shape, elongating the body.\nGiraffes gain their long necks by a different heterochrony, extending the development of their cervical vertebrae; they retain the usual mammalian number of these vertebrae, seven. This number appears to be constrained by the use of neck somites to form the mammalian diaphragm muscle; the result is that the embryonic neck is divided into three modules, the middle one (C3 to C5) serving the diaphragm. The assumption is that disrupting this would kill the embryo rather than giving it more vertebrae.\n\nHeterochrony can be identified by comparing phylogenetically close species, for example a group of different bird species whose legs differ in their average length. These comparisons are complex because there are no universal ontogenetic timemarkers. The method of event pairing attempts to overcome this by comparing the relative timing of two events at a time. This method detects event heterochronies, as opposed to allometric changes. It is cumbersome to use because the number of event pair characters increases with the square of the number of events compared. Event pairing can however be automated, for instance with the PARSIMOV script. A recent method, continuous analysis, rests on a simple standardization of ontogenetic time or sequences, on squared change parsimony and phylogenetic independent contrasts.\n\nPaedomorphosis can be the result of neoteny, the retention of juvenile traits into the adult form as a result of retardation of somatic development, or of progenesis, the acceleration of developmental processes such that the juvenile form becomes a sexually mature adult.\n\nNeoteny retards the development of the organism into an adult, and has been described as \"eternal childhood\". In this form of heterochrony, the developmental stage of childhood is itself extended, and certain developmental processes that normally take place only during childhood (such as accelerated brain growth in humans), is also extended throughout this period. Neoteny has been implicated as a developmental cause for a number of behavior changes, as a result of increased brain plasticity and extended childhood.\n\nProgenesis (or paedogenesis) can be observed in the axolotl (\"Ambystoma mexicanum\"). Axolotls reach full sexual maturity while retaining their fins and gills (in other words, still in the juvenile form of their ancestors).They will remain in aquatic environments in this truncated developmental form, rather than moving onto land as other sexually mature salamander species. This is thought to be a form of hypomorphosis (earlier ending of development) that is both hormonally and genetically driven. The entire metamorphosis that would allow the salamander to transition into the adult form is essentially blocked by both of these drivers.\n\nPaedomorphosis may play a critical role in avian cranial evolution. The skulls and beaks of living, adult birds retain the anatomy of the juvenile theropod dinosaurs from which they evolved. Extant birds have large eyes and brains relative to the rest of the skull; a condition seen in adult birds that represents (broadly speaking) the juvenile stage of a dinosaur. A juvenile avian ancestor (as typified by \"Coelophysis\" ) would have a short face, large eyes, a thin palate, narrow jugal bone, tall and thin postorbitals, restricted adductors, and a short and bulbous braincase. As an organism such as this aged, they would change greatly in their cranial morphology to develop a robust skull with larger, overlapping bones. Birds, however, retain this juvenille morphology Evidence from molecular experiments suggests both fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and members of the WNT signalling pathway have facilitated paedomorphosis in birds. These signalling pathways are known to play roles in facial patterning in other vertebrate species. This retention of the juvenile ancestral state has driven other changes in the anatomy that result in a light, highly kinetic (moveable) skull composed of many small, non\"-\"overlapping bones. This is believed to have facilitated the evolution of cranial kinesis in birds which has played a critical role in their ecological success.\n\nPeramorphosis is delayed maturation with extended periods of growth. An example is the extinct Irish elk. From the fossil record, its antlers spanned up to 12 feet wide, which is about a third larger than the antlers of its close relative the moose. The Irish elk had larger antlers due to extended development during their period of growth.\n\nAnother example of peramorphosis is seen in insular (island) rodents. Their characteristics include gigantism, wider cheek and teeth, reduced litter size, and longer lifespan. Their relatives that inhabit continental environments are much smaller. Insular rodents have evolved these features to accommodate the abundance of food and resources they have on their islands. These factors are part of a complex phenomenon termed Island syndrome. With less predation and competition for resources, selection favored overdevelopment of these species. Reduced litter sizes enable overdevelopment of their bodies into larger ones.\n\nThe mole salamander, a close relative to the axolotl, displays both paedomorphosis and paramorphosis. The larva can develop in either direction. Population density, food, and the amount of water may have an effect on the expression of heterochrony. A study conducted on the mole salamander in 1987 found it evident that a higher percentage of individuals became paedomorphic when there was a low larval population density in a constant water level as opposed to a high larval population density in drying water. This had an implication that led to hypotheses that selective pressures imposed by the environment, such as predation and loss of resources, were instrumental to the cause of these trends. These ideas were reinforced by other studies, such as peramorphosis in the Puerto Rican Tree frog. Another reason could be generation time, or the lifespan of the species in question. When a species has a relatively short lifespan, natural selection favors evolution of paedomorphosis (e.g. Axolotl: 7–10 years). Conversely, in long lifespans natural selection favors evolution of peramorphosis (e.g. Irish Elk: 20–22 years).\n\nHeterochrony is responsible for a wide variety of effects such as the lengthening of the fingers by adding extra phalanges in dolphins to form their flippers, sexual dimorphism, the neotenous origin of the vertebrates from a tunicate larva, and the polymorphism seen between insect castes.\n\nSeveral heterochronies have been described in humans, relative to the chimpanzee. In chimpanzee fetuses, brain and head growth starts at about the same developmental stage and grow at a rate similar to that of humans, but growth stops soon after birth, whereas humans continue brain and head growth several years after birth. This particular type of heterochrony, hypermorphosis, involves a delay in the offset of a developmental process, or what is the same, the presence of an early developmental process in later stages of development. Humans have some 30 different neotenies in comparison to the chimpanzee, retaining larger heads, smaller jaws and noses, and shorter limbs, features found in juvenile chimpanzees.\n\nThe term \"heterokairy\" was proposed in 2003 by John Spicer and Warren Burggren to distinguish plasticity in timing of the onset of developmental events at the level of an individual or population.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "64314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64314", "title": "Ingeborg Bachmann", "text": "Ingeborg Bachmann\n\nIngeborg Bachmann (25 June 1926 – 17 October 1973) was an Austrian poet and author.\n\nBachmann was born in Klagenfurt, in the Austrian state of Carinthia, the daughter of a headmaster. She studied philosophy, psychology, German philology, and law at the universities of Innsbruck, Graz, and Vienna. In 1949, she received her Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Vienna with her dissertation titled \"The Critical Reception of the Existential Philosophy of Martin Heidegger\"; her thesis adviser was Victor Kraft.\n\nAfter graduating, Bachmann worked as a scriptwriter and editor at the Allied radio station \"Rot-Weiss-Rot\", a job that enabled her to obtain an overview of contemporary literature and also supplied her with a decent income, making possible proper literary work. Furthermore, her first radio dramas were published by the station. Her literary career was enhanced by contact with Hans Weigel (littérateur and sponsor of young post-war literature) and the legendary literary circle known as Gruppe 47, whose members also included Ilse Aichinger, Paul Celan, Heinrich Böll, Marcel Reich-Ranicki and Günter Grass. She won the Prize of Group 47 in 1953 for her poetry collection \"Die gestundete Zeit\".\n\nIn 1953, she moved to Rome, Italy, where she spent the large part of the following years working on poems, essays and short stories as well as opera libretti in collaboration with Hans Werner Henze, which soon brought with them international fame and numerous awards.\nHer relationship with the Swiss author Max Frisch (1911–1991) influenced the depiction of the second protagonist in Frisch's 1964 novel \"Gantenbein\" upon her. His infidelity, and their separation in 1962, had a deep impact on Bachmann.\n\nDuring her later years she suffered from alcoholism and drug abuse. A friend described it: \"I was deeply shocked by the magnitude of her tablet addiction. It must have been 100 per day, the container bin was full of empty boxes. She looked bad, she was waxlike pale. And the whole body was full of bruises. I wondered, what could it have been. Then when I saw how she slipped her Gauloise that she smoked and let it burn off on the arm I realized: burns caused by falling cigarettes. The plenty of tablets had made her body insensible to pain.\" \nOn the night of 25/26 September 1973 a fire occurred in her bedroom, and she was taken to the Roman Sant' Eugenio hospital for treatment. (Local police concluded that the blaze was caused by a cigarette.) \nDuring her stay, she experienced withdrawal symptoms complicated from barbiturate substance abuse. \nThe doctors treating her were not aware of this habit, and it may have contributed to her subsequent death on 17 October 1973. She is buried at the Annabichl cemetery in Klagenfurt.\nBachmann's doctoral dissertation expresses her growing disillusionment with Heideggerian existentialism, which was in part resolved through her growing interest in Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" significantly influenced her relationship to language. During her lifetime, Bachmann was known mostly for her two collections of poetry, \"Die gestundete Zeit\" and \"Anrufung des Grossen Bären\". \n\nBachmann's literary work focuses on themes like personal boundaries, establishment of the truth, and philosophy of language, the latter in the tradition of Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Many of her prose works represent the struggles of women to survive and to find a voice in post-war society. She also addresses the histories of imperialism and fascism, in particular, the persistence of imperialist ideas in the present. Fascism was a recurring theme in her writings. In her novel \"Der Fall Franza\" (\"The Case of Franza\") Bachmann argued that fascism had not died in 1945 but had survived in the German speaking world of the 1960s in human relations and particularly in men's oppression of women. In Germany the achievements of the women's rights campaign at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century had been systematically undone by the fascist Nazi regime in the 1930s. Bachmann's engagement with fascism followed that of other women writers who in the immediate post-war period dealt with fascism from a woman's perspective, such as Anna Seghers, Ilse Aichinger, Ingeborg Drewitz and Christa Wolf.\nBachmann was also in the vanguard of Austrian women writers who discovered in their private lives the political realities from which they attempted to achieve emancipation. Bachmann's writings and those of Barbara Frischmuth, Brigitte Schwaiger and Anna Mitgutsch were widely published in Germany. Male Austrian authors such as Franz Innerhofer, Josef Winkler and Peter Turrini wrote equally popular works on traumatic experiences of socialisation. Often these authors produced their works for major German publishing houses. After Bergmann's death in 1973 Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard, Peter Handke and Elfriede Jelinek continued the tradition of Austrian literature in Germany.\n\nBetween November 1959 and February 1960 Bachmann gave five lectures on poetics at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Known as the \"Frankfurter Vorlesungen: Probleme zeitgenössischer Dichtung\" (\"Frankfurt Lectures: Problems of Contemporary Writings\") they are historically and substantively Bachmann's central work. In it she explained recurring themes in her early literary publications and she discussed the function of literature in society. Bachmann insisted that literature had to be viewed in its historic context, thus foreshadowing a rising interest in studying the connection between literary discourse and the contemporary understanding of history.\n\nIn the first lecture on \"Fragen und Scheinfragen\" (\"Questions and Pseudo Questions\") Bachmann focused on the role of writers in the post-war society and lists essential questions that are \"destructive and frightening in their simplicity\". They are: why write? What do we mean by change and why do we want it through art? What are the limitations of the writer who wants to bring about change? Bachmann asserted that the great literary accomplishments of the 20th century were expressions in language and thus the poetic moral and intellectual renewal. In her mind the writer's new thinking and experience formed the core of the literary works. This in turn lets a writer come closer to a new language. She stressed that a new language was inhabited by a new spirit. Thus a writer may despair over the importance of language and she sited Hugo von Hofmannsthal's \"Ein Brief\" (1902) as the first articulation of this problem.\n\nThe second lecture \"Über Gedichte\" (\"On Poems\") distinguishes poetry with its new power to grasp reality in its language, from other genres such as novels and plays. With reference to Günter Eich and Stefan George she identified a new generation of poet-prophets whose mission it was to lead the world to the discovery of an \"ever purer heaven of art\". She set these poets apart from the surrealists who aspired to violence and the futurists who claimed that \"war is beautiful\". She argued that these two movements exemplified art-for-art's sake and that the careers of Gottfried Benn and Ezra Pound exemplified the friendship between pure aestheticism with political barbarism. She referenced Kafka on the need to \"take the axe to the frozen sea in us\" and the refusal to remain silent about the crimes in our world. In the lecture she also named writings of Nelly Sachs, Marie Luise Kaschnitz, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Paul Celan as examples of new poetry.\n\nIn the third lecture on \"Das schreibende Ich\" (\"The Writing \"I\"\") Bachmann addressed the question of the first-person narrator. She was concerned with the accountability and authority, the authenticity and reliability of a person of narrating a work. She distinguished between the unproblematic \"I\" in letters and diaries which conceal the person from the author, and the unproblematic \"I\" in memoirs. She argued that Henry Miller and Louis-Ferdinand Céline placed themselves and their own personal experience directly at the centre of their novels. She referenced Tolstoy's \"The Kreuzer Sonata\" and Dostoyevsky's \"The House of the Dead\" as first-person narrators of the inner story. She argued that narrators could provide a new treatment of time (for example Italo Svevo), of material (for example Proust) or of space (for example Hans Henny Jahnn). Bachmann asserted that in the modern novel the \"I\" had shifted and the narrator no longer lives the story, instead the story is in the narrator.\n\nIn the fourth lecture \"Der Umgang mit Namen\" (\"The Close association with Names\") Bachmann explored how names could have a life of their own. She discussed the use of names in contemporary literature. She identified \"denied names\" such as in Kafka's \"The Castle\", \"ironic naming\" by Thomas Mann, \"name games\" in James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and instances where the identity of the character is not secured by a name but by the context, such as in Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\". \n\nIn the fifth lecture on \"Literatur als Utopie\" (\"Literature as Utopia\") she turned to the question of what makes literature utopian. She argued that it was the process that was set in motion in the writer and reader as a result of their interaction with literature that made a work utopian. She argued that literature could make us aware of the lack, both in the work and in our own world. Readers could remove this lack by giving the work a chance in our time. Thus she argued each work of literature is \"a realm which reaches forward and has unknown limits\". Bachmann's understanding of utopia as direction rather than a goal, and her argument that it was the function of literature to take an utopian direction stemmed from Robert Musil who had analysed European modernism in his dissertation on Ernst Mach.\n\nAlthough German language writers such as Hilde Domin, Luise Rinser and Nelly Sachs had published notable works on women's issues in the post-war period it was only in the 1970s that a feminist movement emerged in West Germany. After her death, Bachmann became popular among feminist readers. Feminist scholars' engagement with her work after her death led to a wave of scholarship that also drew attention to her prose work. Her works gained popularity within the emerging \"Frauenliteratur\" (\"women's literature\") movement which struggled to find the authentic female voice. New publishing houses carried the movement, such as the feminist press \"Frauenoffensive\" (\"Women's Offensive\"), which published writings by Verena Stefan.\n\nThe Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, awarded annually in Klagenfurt since 1977, is named after her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "172550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172550", "title": "International relations theory", "text": "International relations theory\n\nInternational relations theory is the study of international relations (IR) from a theoretical perspective. It attempts to provide a conceptual framework upon which international relations can be analyzed. Ole Holsti describes international relations theories as acting like pairs of coloured sunglasses that allow the wearer to see only salient events relevant to the theory; e.g., an adherent of realism may completely disregard an event that a constructivist might pounce upon as crucial, and vice versa. The three most prominent theories are realism, liberalism and constructivism. Sometimes, institutionalism proposed and developed by Keohane and Nye is discussed as an paradigm differed from liberalism. \n\nInternational relations theories can be divided into \"positivist/rationalist\" theories which focus on a principally state-level analysis, and \"post-positivist/reflectivist\" ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security, ranging from class, to gender, to postcolonial security. Many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in IR theory, including constructivism, institutionalism, Marxism, neo-Gramscianism, and others. However, two positivist schools of thought are most prevalent: realism and liberalism. Constructivism, however, is increasingly becoming mainstream.\n\nThe study of international relations, as theory, can be traced to E. H. Carr's \"The Twenty Years' Crisis\", which was published in 1939, and to Hans Morgenthau's \"Politics Among Nations\" published in 1948. International relations, as a discipline, is believed to have emerged after the First World War with the establishment of a Chair of International Relations at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Early international relations scholarship in the interwar years focused on the need for the balance of power system to be replaced with a system of collective security. These thinkers were later described as \"Idealists\". The leading critique of this school of thinking was the \"realist\" analysis offered by Carr.\n\nHowever, a more recent study, by David Long and Brian Schmidt in 2005, offers a revisionist account of the origins of the field international relations. They claim that the history of the field can be traced back to late 19th Century imperialism and internationalism. The fact that the history of the field is presented by \"great debates\", such as the realist-idealist debate, does not correspond with the historic evidence found in earlier works: \"We should once and for all dispense with the outdated anachronistic artifice of the debate between the idealists and realists as the dominant framework for and understanding the history of the field\". Their revisionist account claims that, up until 1918, international relations already existed in the form of colonial administration, race science, and race development.\n\nA clear distinction is made between explanatory and constitutive approaches when classifying international relations theories. Explanatory theories are ones which postulates the world is something external to theorize about. A constitutive theory is one which suggest that theories actually help construct the world.\n\nRealism or political realism has been the dominant theory of international relations since the conception of the discipline. The theory claims to rely upon an ancient tradition of thought which includes writers such as Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes. Early realism can be characterized as a reaction against interwar idealist thinking. The outbreak of World War II was seen by realists as evidence of the deficiencies of idealist thinking. There are various strands of modern-day realist thinking. However, the main tenets of the theory have been identified as statism, survival, and self-help.\n\n\nRealism makes several key assumptions. It assumes that nation-states are unitary, geographically based actors in an anarchic international system with no authority above capable of regulating interactions between states as no true authoritative world government exists. Secondly, it assumes that sovereign states, rather than intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, or multinational corporations, are the primary actors in international affairs. Thus, states, as the highest order, are in competition with one another. As such, a state acts as a rational autonomous actor in pursuit of its own self-interest with a primary goal to maintain and ensure its own security—and thus its sovereignty and survival. Realism holds that in pursuit of their interests, states will attempt to amass resources, and that relations between states are determined by their relative levels of power. That level of power is in turn determined by the state's military, economic, and political capabilities.\n\nSome realists, known as human nature realists or classical realists, believe that states are inherently aggressive, that territorial expansion is constrained only by opposing powers, while others, known as offensive/defensive realists, believe that states are obsessed with the security and continuation of the state's existence. The defensive view can lead to a security dilemma, where increasing one's own security can bring along greater instability as the opponent(s) builds up its own arms, making security a zero-sum game where only \"relative gains\" can be made.\n\nNeorealism or structural realism is a development of realism advanced by Kenneth Waltz in \"Theory of International Politics\". It is, however, only one strand of neorealism. Joseph Grieco has combined neo-realist thinking with more traditional realists. This strand of theory is sometimes called \"modern realism\". Waltz's neorealism contends that the effect of structure must be taken into account in explaining state behavior. Structure is defined twofold as: a) the ordering principle of the international system which is anarchy, and b) the distribution of capabilities across units. Waltz also challenges traditional realism's emphasis on traditional military power, instead characterizing power in terms of the combined capabilities of the state.\n\nThe precursor to liberal international relations theory was \"idealism\". Idealism (or utopianism) was viewed critically by those who saw themselves as \"realists\", for instance E. H. Carr. In international relations, idealism (also called \"Wilsonianism\" because of its association with Woodrow Wilson who personified it) is a school of thought that holds that a state should make its internal political philosophy the goal of its foreign policy. For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. Wilson's idealism was a precursor to liberal international relations theory, which would arise amongst the \"institution-builders\" after World War I.\n\nLiberalism holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the primary determinant of state behavior. Unlike realism, where the state is seen as a unitary actor, liberalism allows for plurality in state actions. Thus, preferences will vary from state to state, depending on factors such as culture, economic system or government type. Liberalism also holds that interaction between states is not limited to the political/security (\"high politics\"), but also economic/cultural (\"low politics\") whether through commercial firms, organizations or individuals. Thus, instead of an anarchic international system, there are plenty of opportunities for cooperation and broader notions of power, such as cultural capital (for example, the influence of films leading to the popularity of the country's culture and creating a market for its exports worldwide). Another assumption is that absolute gains can be made through co-operation and interdependence—thus peace can be achieved.\n\nThe democratic peace theory argues that liberal democracies have never (or almost never) made war on one another and have fewer conflicts among themselves. This is seen as contradicting especially the realist theories and this empirical claim is now one of the great disputes in political science. Numerous explanations have been proposed for the democratic peace. It has also been argued, as in the book \"Never at War\", that democracies conduct diplomacy in general very differently from non-democracies. (Neo)realists disagree with Liberals over the theory, often citing structural reasons for the peace, as opposed to the state's government. Sebastian Rosato, a critic of democratic peace theory, points to America's behavior towards left-leaning democracies in Latin America during the Cold War to challenge democratic peace. One argument is that economic interdependence makes war between trading partners less likely. In contrast realists claim that economic interdependence increases rather than decreases the likelihood of conflict.\n\nNeoliberalism, liberal institutionalism or neo-liberal institutionalism is an advancement of liberal thinking. It argues that international institutions can allow nations to successfully cooperate in the international system.\n\nRobert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye, in response to neorealism, develop an opposing theory they dub \"complex interdependence.\" Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye explain, \"... complex interdependence sometimes comes closer to reality than does realism.\" In explaining this, Keohane and Nye cover the three assumptions in realist thought: First, states are coherent units and are the dominant actors in international relations; second, force is a usable and effective instrument of policy; and finally, the assumption that there is a hierarchy in international politics.\n\nThe heart of Keohane and Nye's argument is that in international politics there are, in fact, multiple channels that connect societies exceeding the conventional Westphalian system of states. This manifests itself in many forms ranging from informal governmental ties to multinational corporations and organizations. Here they define their terminology; interstate relations are those channels assumed by realists; transgovernmental relations occur when one relaxes the realist assumption that states act coherently as units; transnational applies when one removes the assumption that states are the only units. It is through these channels that political exchange occurs, not through the limited interstate channel as championed by realists.\n\nSecondly, Keohane and Nye argue that there is not, in fact, a hierarchy among issues, meaning that not only is the martial arm of foreign policy not the supreme tool by which to carry out a state's agenda, but that there are a multitude of different agendas that come to the forefront. The line between domestic and foreign policy becomes blurred in this case, as realistically there is no clear agenda in interstate relations.\n\nFinally, the use of military force is not exercised when complex interdependence prevails. The idea is developed that between countries in which a complex interdependence exists, the role of the military in resolving disputes is negated. However, Keohane and Nye go on to state that the role of the military is in fact important in that \"alliance's political and military relations with a rival bloc.\"\n\nOne version of post-liberal theory argues that within the modern, globalized world, states in fact are driven to cooperate in order to ensure security and sovereign interests. The departure from classical liberal theory is most notably felt in the re-interpretation of the concepts of sovereignty and autonomy. Autonomy becomes a problematic concept in shifting away from a notion of freedom, self-determination, and agency to a heavily responsible and duty laden concept. Importantly, autonomy is linked to a capacity for good governance. Similarly, sovereignty also experiences a shift from a right to a duty. In the global economy, International organizations hold sovereign states to account, leading to a situation where sovereignty is co-produced among \"sovereign\" states. The concept becomes a variable capacity of good governance and can no longer be accepted as an absolute right. One possible way to interpret this theory, is the idea that in order to maintain global stability and security and solve the problem of the anarchic world system in International Relations, no overarching, global, sovereign authority is created. Instead, states collectively abandon some rights for full autonomy and sovereignty. \nAnother version of post-liberalism, drawing on work in political philosophy after the end of the Cold War, as well as on democratic transitions in particular in Latin America, argues that social forces from below are essential in understanding the nature of the state and the international system. Without understanding their contribution to political order and its progressive possibilities, particularly in the area of peace in local and international frameworks, the weaknesses of the state, the failings of the liberal peace, and challenges to global governance cannot be realised or properly understood. Furthermore, the impact of social forces on political and economic power, structures, and institutions, provides some empirical evidence of the complex shifts currently underway in IR.\n\nConstructivism or social constructivism has been described as a challenge to the dominance of neo-liberal and neo-realist international relations theories. Michael Barnett describes constructivist international relations theories as being concerned with how ideas define international structure, how this structure defines the interests and identities of states and how states and non-state actors reproduce this structure. The key element of constructivism is the belief that \"International politics is shaped by persuasive ideas, collective values, culture, and social identities.\" Constructivism argues that international reality is socially constructed by cognitive structures which give meaning to the material world. The theory emerged from debates concerning the scientific method of international relations theories and theories role in the production of international power. Emanuel Adler states that constructivism occupies a middle ground between rationalist and interpretative theories of international relations.\n\nConstructivist theory criticises the static assumptions of traditional international relations theory and emphasizes that international relations is a social construction. Constructivism is a theory critical of the ontological basis of rationalist theories of international relations. Whereas realism deals mainly with security and material power, and liberalism looks primarily at economic interdependence and domestic-level factors, constructivism most concerns itself with the role of ideas in shaping the international system; indeed it is possible there is some overlap between constructivism and realism or liberalism, but they remain separate schools of thought. By \"ideas\" constructivists refer to the goals, threats, fears, identities, and other elements of perceived reality that influence states and non-state actors within the international system. Constructivists believe that these ideational factors can often have far-reaching effects, and that they can trump materialistic power concerns.\n\nFor example, constructivists note that an increase in the size of the U.S. military is likely to be viewed with much greater concern in Cuba, a traditional antagonist of the United States, than in Canada, a close U.S. ally. Therefore, there must be perceptions at work in shaping international outcomes. As such, constructivists do not see anarchy as the invariable foundation of the international system, but rather argue, in the words of Alexander Wendt, that \"anarchy is what states make of it\". Constructivists also believe that social norms shape and change foreign policy over time rather than security which realists cite.\n\nMarxist and Neo-Marxist international relations theories are structuralist paradigms which reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. Marxist approaches argue the position of historical materialism and make the assumption that the economic concerns transcend others; allowing for the elevation of \"class\" as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. A sub-discipline of Marxist IR is Critical Security Studies. Gramscian approaches rely on the ideas of Italian Antonio Gramsci whose writings concerned the hegemony that capitalism holds as an ideology. Marxist approaches have also inspired Critical Theorists such as Robert W. Cox who argues that \"Theory is always for someone and for some purpose\".\n\nOne notable Marxist approach to international relations theory is Immanuel Wallerstein's World-system theory which can be traced back to the ideas expressed by Lenin in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of capitalism. World-system theory argues that globalized capitalism has created a core of modern industrialized countries which exploit a periphery of exploited \"Third World\" countries. These ideas were developed by the Latin American Dependency School. \"Neo-Marxist\" or \"New Marxist\" approaches have returned to the writings of Karl Marx for their inspiration. Key \"New Marxists\" include Justin Rosenberg and Benno Teschke. Marxist approaches have enjoyed a renaissance since the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.\n\nCriticisms of Marxists approaches to international relations theory include the narrow focus on material and economic aspects of life.\n\nFeminist approaches to international relations became popular in the early 1990s. Such approaches emphasize that women's experiences continue to be excluded from the study of international relations. International Relations Feminists who argue that gender relations are integral to international relations focus on the role of diplomatic wives and marital relationship that facilitate sex trafficking. Early feminist IR approaches were part of the \"Third Great Debate\" between positivists and post-positivists. They argued against what they saw as the positivism and state-centrism of mainstream international relations. J. Ann Tickner argues that these approaches did not describe what a feminist perspective on world politics would look like.\n\nThe feminist international relations scholar Jacqui True differentiates between empirical feminism, analytical feminism and normative feminism. Empirical feminism sees women and gender relations as empirical aspects of international relations. It is argued that mainstream international relations emphasis on anarchy and statecraft mean that areas of study that make the reproduction of the state system possible are marginalized. Analytical feminism claims that the theoretical framework of international relations has a gender bias. Here gender refers not to the \"biological\" differences between men and women but the social constructs of masculine and feminine identity. It is claimed that in mainstream international relations masculinity is associated with objectivity. Analytical feminists would see neo-realism's dislike of domestic explanations for explaining interstate behaviour as an example of this bias. Normative feminist sees theorizing as part of an agenda for change.\n\nCriticisms of feminist international relations theory include its portrayal of women in developing countries.\n\nFeminist International Relations is sometimes oversimplified into a women's issue or simply a need to 'add women and stir'. \"Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics\", an article by Charlotte Hooper, makes the case that looking at international relations through a gendered lens is important for all genders. The article illustrates that the hyper-masculinity used in international relations has a negative impact on all genders. It privileges only a certain kind of man, forcing all others to fit into the constraints of one vision of masculinity. Hooper also argues that this gendered lens requires a complete overhaul of traditional methods, rather than just adding women to the study. \"In order to investigate the intersections between gender identities and international relations, one cannot rely on approaches which would take gender identities as 'givens' or as independent, externally derived variables\". Traditional methods do not meet the needs of men or women. They attempt to reduce our needs to security, failing to take into account class, education level, gender, or experience. Hooper argues that traditional studies of international relations are causing us to miss many factors for more than just women and children.\n\nTo appeal to sympathetic sceptics, Hooper explains that international relations shapes masculinity in a way that affects us all. To establish this she explains that masculinity and femininity are social constructs that can be influenced by theories and discourse. Hooper turns so called feminist international relations into gendered international relations, which brings in all people and highlights the importance of new methods to the field. Genders just like class, ethnicity, age, etc. can help inform our understanding of how people and nations act and if we ignore the range of masculinities and femininities we are only working with half the puzzle. The system that Feminist International Relations is trying to subvert affects us all and influences many of our traditional theories. Hooper offers the example of war which has shaped the male body; it has created men as takers of life and women as givers of it. We proceed to tell men they simply have more natural aggression. Hooper also illustrates the ways masculinity, like femininity, has been influenced by colonization. The hierarchy formed by colonization labels Asians as effeminate, Africans as savage and white men as the proper balance at the top the hierarchy. War and colonialism still influence international relations to a large extent.\n\nGreen theory in international relations is a sub-field of international relations theory which concerns international environmental cooperation.\n\nSeveral alternative approaches have been developed based on foundationalism, anti-foundationalism, positivism, behaviouralism, structuralism and post-structuralism. These theories however are not widely known.\n\nBehaviouralism in international relations theory is an approach to international relations theory which believes in the unity of science, the idea that the social sciences are not fundamentally different from the natural sciences.\n\nThe \"English School\" of international relations theory, also known as International Society, Liberal Realism, Rationalism or the British institutionalists, maintains that there is a 'society of states' at the international level, despite the condition of \"anarchy\", i.e., the lack of a ruler or world state. Despite being called the English School many of the academics from this school were neither English nor from the United Kingdom.\n\nA great deal of the work of the English School concerns the examination of traditions of past international theory, casting it, as Martin Wight did in his 1950s-era lectures at the London School of Economics, into three divisions:\nIn broad terms, the English School itself has supported the rationalist or Grotian tradition, seeking a middle way (or via media) between the power politics of realism and the \"utopianism\" of revolutionism. The English School reject behavioralist approaches to international relations theory. The international relations theories have become a typical learning of the fundamental insight and origin of international relations.\n\nFunctionalism is a theory of international relations that arose principally from the experience of European integration. Rather than the self-interest that realists see as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on common interests shared by states. Integration develops its own internal dynamic: as states integrate in limited functional or technical areas, they increasingly find that momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This \"invisible hand\" of integration phenomenon is termed \"spillover\". Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration's reach as it progresses. This usage, and the usage in functionalism in international relations, is the less common meaning of \"functionalism\".\n\nMore commonly, however, functionalism is an argument that explains phenomena as functions of a system rather than an actor or actors. Immanuel Wallerstein employed a functionalist theory when he argued that the Westphalian international political system arose to secure and protect the developing international capitalist system. His theory is called \"functionalist\" because it says that an event was a function of the preferences of a system and not the preferences of an agent. Functionalism is different from structural or realist arguments in that while both look to broader, structural causes, realists (and structuralists more broadly) say that the structure gives incentives to agents, while functionalists attribute causal power to the system itself, bypassing agents entirely.\n\nPost-structuralism differs from most other approaches to international politics because it does not see itself as a theory, school or paradigm which produces a single account of the subject matter. Instead, post-structuralism is an approach, attitude, or ethos that pursues critique in particular way. Post-structuralism sees critique as an inherently positive exercise that establishes the conditions of possibility for pursuing alternatives. It states that \"Every understanding of international politics depends upon abstraction, representation and interpretation\". Scholars associated with post-structuralism in international relations include Richard K. Ashley, James Der Derian, Michael J. Shapiro, R. B. J. Walker, and Lene Hansen.\n\nPost-modernist approaches to international relations are critical of metanarratives and denounces traditional IR's claims to truth and neutrality.\n\nPostcolonial International relations scholarship posits a critical theory approach to International relations (IR), and is a non-mainstream area of international relations scholarship. Post-colonialism focuses on the persistence of colonial forms of power and the continuing existence of racism in world politics.\n\nEvolutionary perspectives, such as from evolutionary psychology, have been argued to help explain many features of international relations. Humans in the ancestral environment did not live in states and likely rarely had interactions with groups outside of a very local area. However, a variety of evolved psychological mechanisms, in particular those for dealing with inter group interactions, are argued to influence current international relations. These include evolved mechanisms for social exchange, cheating and detecting cheating, status conflicts, leadership, ingroup and outgroup distinction and biases, coalitions, and violence. Evolutionary concepts such as inclusive fitness may help explain seeming limitations of a concept such as egotism which is of fundamental importance to realist and rational choice international relations theories.\n\nIn recent years, with significant advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging tools, IR Theory has benefited from further multidisciplinary contributions. Prof. Nayef Al-Rodhan from Oxford University has argued that neuroscience can significantly advance the IR debate as it brings forward new insights about human nature, which is at the centre of political theory. New tools to scan the human brain, and studies in neurochemistry allow us to grasp what drives divisiveness, conflict, and human nature in general. The theory of human nature in Classical Realism, developed long before the advent of neuroscience, stressed that egoism and competition were central to human behaviour, to politics and social relations. Evidence from neuroscience, however, provides a more nuanced understanding of human nature, which Prof. Al-Rodhan describes as emotional amoral egoistic. These three features can be summarized as follows: 1. emotionality is more pervasive than rationality and central to decision-making, 2. we are born neither moral, nor immoral but \"amoral\", and circumstances decide how our moral compass will develop, and finally, 3. we are egoistic insofar as we seek to ensure our survival, which is a basic form of egoism. This neurophilosophy of human nature can also be applied to states - similarly to the Realist analogy between the character (and flaws) of man and the state in international politics. Prof Al-Rodhan argues there are significant examples in history and contemporary politics that demonstrate states behave less rationality than IR dogma would have us believe: different strategic cultures, habits, identity politics influence state conduct, geopolitics and diplomacy in profound ways.\n\nQueer international relations scholarship aims to broaden the scope and method of traditional international relations theory to include sexed and gendered approaches that are often excluded in the discipline at large. While affiliated with feminist theory and gender studies, as well as post-structuralism, queer IR theory is not reducible to any other field of international relations scholarship. Queer international relations theory works to expose the many ways in which sexualities and gender affect international politics. This includes the ways in which queer subjects and practices are disciplined, normalized, or capitalized on by traditional sites of power; how queer identities have often been the focus of domestic and foreign policy in heteronormative states; and how the order-versus-anarchy dichotomy in traditional international relations theory socially manifests itself in normal-versus-perverse and hetero/homo-normative versus queer dichotomies. Queer IR theory takes sites of traditional international relations scholarship (war and peace, international political economy, and state and nation building) as its subjects of study. It also expands its scope and methods beyond those traditionally utilized in Realist IR scholarship. Ontologically, queer IR utilizes a different scope from traditional IR, as it aims to non-monolithically address the needs of various queer groups, including trans-, inter-, cross-, and pan- gendered, sexed, and sexualized bodies. Epistemologically, queer IR explores alternative methodologies to those traditionally used in IR, as it emphasizes the sexual dimension of knowledge within international relations.\n\nCriticism for queer theory in general, and queer international relations in particular, addresses worries of the minimization or exclusion of certain groups. While queer IR incorporates transgender individuals in its expanded scope, some argue its emphasis on sexuality fails to adequately capture transgender experiences. Susan Stryker contests that queer theory’s approach merely treats the ‘T’ in LGBT as another, detached genre of sexual identity, “rather than perceived, like race or class, as something that cuts across existing sexualities, revealing in often unexpected ways the means through which all identities achieve their specificities.” While queer theoretical spaces remain friendly to transgender work, Stryker argues that ‘queer’ often acts as code for ‘gays’ or ‘lesbians,’ implicitly excluding transgender issues by privileging sexual orientations and identities. This leads Stryker to advocate that transgender studies follows its own trajectory.\n\nLaura Sjoberg advocates for allying trans-theorizing and feminist theorizing in IR. She suggests some possible improvements that trans-theorizing may offer for feminist IR theory, which include a more nuanced understanding of gender hierarchy through a pluralist approach to sex, a holistic view of gender that resists viewing gender entirely either as a social construction or as biologically essential, and an increased awareness of gender as involving power relations among different sexes and genders. Additionally, Sjoberg argues, trans-theorizing makes important contributions to traditional IR’s understanding of global politics. Discussions of ‘outness,’ visibility, invisibility, and hypervisibility in transgender theorizing are applicable to questions of identity, relations between individuals and groups, and the enforcement of norms in IR. Additionally, transgender understandings of transition and liminality can fill the gap in traditional IR’s need for an account of change and unrest in the international system. Moreover, talk of “crossing” and “passing” in trans-theorizing may assist in explaining the process, logic, and consequences of states shifting identities. Finally, transgender disidentification, either from exclusionary movements or from their assigned sex, can help in unpacking “the problem of difference” in international relations. As such, Sjoberg advocates for the inclusion of trans-theorizing in feminist IR theory in the interests of improving explanations and understandings of global politics.\n\nSeveral IR scholars bemoan what they see as a trend away from IR theory in IR scholarship. The September 2013 issue of \"European Journal of International Relations\" and the June 2015 issue of \"Perspectives on Politics\" debated the state of IR theory. A 2016 study showed that while theoretical innovations and qualitative analyses are a large part of graduate training, journals favor middle-range theory, quantitative hypothesis testing and methodology for publishing.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1323461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1323461", "title": "Je Tsongkhapa", "text": "Je Tsongkhapa\n\nZongkapa Lobsang Zhaba, or Tsongkhapa (\"The man from Tsongkha\", 1357–1419), usually taken to mean \"the Man from Onion Valley\", born in Amdo, was a famous teacher of Tibetan Buddhism whose activities led to the formation of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. He is also known by his ordained name Losang Drakpa () or simply as \"Je Rinpoche\" (). He was the son of a Tibetan Longben Tribal leader who also once served as an official of the Yuan Dynasty of China.\n\nIn his two main treatises, the \"Lamrim Chenmo\" () and \"Ngakrim Chenmo\" (), Tsongkhapa meticulously sets forth this graduated way and how one establishes oneself in the paths of sutra and tantra.\n\nWith a Mongolian father and a Tibetan mother, Tsongkhapa was born into a nomadic family in the walled city of Tsongkha in Amdo, Tibet (present-day Haidong and Xining, Qinghai) in 1357. It is said that the Buddha Sakyamuni spoke of his coming as an emanation of the Bodhisattva Manjusri in the short verse from the \"Root Tantra of Manjushri\" ():\nAccording to hagiographic accounts, Tsongkhapa's birth was prophesied by the 12th abbot of the Snar thang monastery, and was recognized as such at a young age, taking the lay vows at the age of three before Rolpe Dorje, 4th Karmapa Lama and was named Künga Nyingpo (). At the age of seven, he was ordained as a śrāmaṇera by Döndrup Rinchen (, 1309–1385), the first abbott of Jakhyung Monastery (), and was given the ordination name Losang Drakpa ().\n\nIt was at this early age that he was able to receive the empowerments of Heruka, Hevajra, and Yamantaka, three of the most prominent wrathful deities of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as being able to recite a great many Sutras, not the least of which was \"Mañjuśrīnāmasamgīti\". He would go on to be a great student of the vinaya, the doctrine of behaviour, and even later of the Six Yogas of Naropa, the Kalachakra tantra, and the practice of Mahamudra. At the age of 24, he received full ordination as a monk of the Sakya school.\n\nFrom Zhönnu Lodrö () and Rendawa (), he received the lineage of the \"Pramanavarttika\" transmitted by Sakya Pandita. He mastered all the courses of study at Drigung kagyud Monastery in Ü-Tsang.\n\nAs an emanation of Manjusri, Tsongkhapa is said have been of \"one mind\" with Atiśa, received the Kadam lineages and studied the major Sarma tantras under Sakya and Kagyu masters. He also studied with a Nyingma teacher, the siddha Lek gyi Dorjé () and the abbot of Shalu Monastery, Chö kyi Pel (), and his main Dzogchen master was Drupchen Lekyi Dorje (), also known as Namkha Gyaltsen (, 1326–1401).\n\nIn addition to his studies, he engaged in extensive meditation retreats. He is reputed to have performed millions of prostrations, mandala offerings and other forms of purification practice. Tsongkhapa often had visions of iṣṭadevatās, especially of Manjusri, with whom he would communicate directly to clarify difficult points of the scriptures.\n\nTsongkhapa was one of the foremost authorities of Tibetan Buddhism at the time. He composed a devotional prayer called the \"Migtsema Prayer\" to his Sakya master Rendawa, which was offered back to Tsongkhapa, with the note of his master saying that these verses were more applicable to Tsongkhapa than to himself.\n\nTsongkhapa died in 1419 at the age of sixty-two. After his death several biographies were written by Lamas of different traditions. Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama, praised Tsongkhapa as one \"who swept away wrong views with the correct and perfect ones.\" Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama, wrote in his poem \"In Praise of the Incomparable Tsong Khapa\":\n\n<poem>When the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyue, Kadam\nAnd Nyingma sects in Tibet were declining,\nYou, O Tsong Khapa, revived Buddha's Doctrine,\nHence I sing this praise to you of Ganden Mountain.</poem>\n\nTsongkhapa was acquainted with all Tibetan Buddhist traditions of his time, and received lineages transmitted in the major schools. His main source of inspiration was the Kadam school, the legacy of Atiśa. Tsongkhapa received two of the three main Kadampa lineages (the Lam-Rim lineage, and the oral guideline lineage) from the Nyingma Lama, Lhodrag Namka-gyeltsen; and the third main Kadampa lineage (the lineage of textual transmission) from the Kagyu teacher Lama Umapa.\n\nTsongkhapa's teachings drew upon these Kadampa teachings of Atiśa, emphasizing the study of Vinaya, the Tripiṭaka, and the Shastras. Atiśa's Lamrim inspired Tsongkhapa's \"Lamrim Chenmo\", which became a main text among his followers. He also practised and taught extensively the Vajrayana, and especially how to bring the Sutra and Tantra teachings together, wrote works that summarized the root teachings of the Buddhist philosophical schools, as well as commentaries on the Prātimokṣa, Prajnaparamita, Candrakirti's \"Madhyamakavatara\", logic, Pure Land and the Sarma tantras.\n\nAccording to Thupten Jinpa, the following elements are essential in a coherent understanding of Tsongkhapa's understanding and interpretation of the Madhyamaka refutation of essentialist ontology:\n\nTsongkhapa's first principal work, \"The Golden Garland of Eloquence\" () demonstrated a philosophical view in line with the Yogacara school and, as became one of his hallmarks, was more influenced by Indian authors than contemporary Tibetan sources. At this time his account of the Madhyamaka \"propounds a philosophy that later Gelukpas [...] call Yogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka, [...] yet does not have the authority of Candrakīrti's Prāsaṅgika interpretation.\"\n\nAfter this early work, his attention focussed on the Prajnaparamita sutras and Dharmakirti's \"Pramanavartika\", and it is this emphasis that dominates all his later philosophical works. Garfield suggests his stance as: \n\nFor Tsongkhapa, calming meditation alone is not sufficient, but should be paired to rigorous, exact thinking \"to push the mind and precipitate a breakthrough in cognitive fluency and insight.\"\n\nTsongkhapa was a proponent of Candrakirti's consequentialist or prasangika interpretation of the Madhyamaka teachings on sunyata (emptiness), rejecting the Svatantrika point of view. According to Tsongkhapa, the Prāsaṅgika-approach is the only acceptable approach within Madhyamaka, rejecting the Svatantrikas because they state that the conventional reality is \"established by virtue of particular characteristics\" (rang gi mtshan nyid kyis grub pa):\nThe classification into Prasangika and Svatantrika originated from their different usages of reason to make \"emptiness\" understandable. The Svātantrikas strive to make positive assertions to attack wrong views, whereas the Prasangikas draw out the contradictory consequences (prasanga) of the opposing views. In Tsongkhapa's reading, the difference becomes one of the understanding of emptiness, which centers on the nature of conventional existence. The Svātantrikas state that conventional phenomena have particular characteristics, by which they can be distinguished, but without an ultimately existing essence. In Tsongkhapa's understanding, these particular characteristics are posited as establishing that conventionally things do have an intrinsic nature, a position which he rejects:\nAlthough Tsongkhapa is regarded as the great champion of the Prasangika-view, according to Thomas Doctor, Tsongkhapa's views on the difference between Prasanghika and Svatantrika are preceded by a 12th-century author, Mabja Jangchub Tsondru (d. 1185).\n\nTsongkhapa nevertheless argues that the Prāsaṅgika's use of reductio ad absurdum is also syllogistic, because one \"refutes the opponent using a subject, a reason, and so forth that are accepted by that opponent.\"\n\nWhile objecting to Bhavaviveka's understanding of a shared object at the conventional level, Tsongkhapa has to leave intact conventional reality and causality, to keep intact the teachings on cyclic existence and the basis for moral behavior. Therefore, he has to explain how conventional reality is perceived in a valid way, which he does by introducing \"conventional valid cognition.\"\n\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, following Candrakirti, all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence, because they are dependently co-arisen with (created by) mental imputation, c.q. the mind. All phenomenon in all possible worlds lack inherent existence and come into existence relative to a designating consciousness which co-arises with that phenomena.\n\nFrom the Prāsaṅgika perspective, in order for something to exist, it must be designated validly by a designating consciousness. To talk about an object that does not exist in relation to a subject is incoherent. Anything which comes into existence through valid designation is part of \"conventional reality\" or \"conventional truth.\" According to Lama Tsongkhapa, something is validly designated (exists conventionally) if it meets all of the following three conditions:\n\nWhatever fails to meet those criteria does not exist, and relationships between objects cannot exist without being validly designated into existence.\n\nNevertheless, Prāsaṅgika are not stating that nothing exists, but instead, hold that phenomena \"only\" come into existence co-dependently with minds which are applying conceptual and nominal conventions to uncharacterized mere experiences. Things and phenomenon \"do exist\" co-dependently, based upon a relationship with a knowing and designating mind, but nothing exists - including the fundamental characteristics which compose our experience - in an independent, self-arising, or self-sustaining manner.\n\nFor Tsongkhapa, extended rational analysis is required to correctly establish what it is that is to be negated. This correct establishment is necessary to reach a liberating insight into emptiness, while avoiding the trap of nihilism, the possibility that \"seeming reality becomes extinct or invalidated if a phenomenon is empty of that very phenomenon.\"\n\nWhile the \"I\" or self is accepted as nominally existing in a conventional way, for Tsongkhapa, following Candrakirti, the object to be negated by reason is the \"metaphysical fiction\" of an intrinsic nature which is \"erroneously reified.\" Tsongkhapa argues that \"there exists within each of us a natural belief, [a naive, normal, pre-philosophical way of seeing the world], which leads us to perceive things and events as possessing some kind of intrinsic existence and identity.\" It is this mistaken perception which is the object to be negated.\n\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, Buddhist (in concreto, the Sarvastivada) and non-Buddhist essentialist schools are not negating the correct object, but are only negating \"imaginary constructs\" and \"acquired ignorance,\" not the innate perception of an inherently existing self. They have \"realized only a coarse selflessness and having thereby suppressed, but not removed from the root, the obstructions to liberation.\" According to Tsongkhapa, the negation of acquired, philosophical notions won't eradicate the afflictions or free one from cycles of rebirth. The negation has to go further, since the object of negation is not an acquired, philosophical notion of a permanent self, but the innate perception of an inherently existing self.\n\nGyumed Khensur Rinpoche Lobsang Jampa, referring to Kalden Gyatso, notes that \"there are actually two objects that must be refuted or destroyed,\" namely this sense of \"I,\" and the subjective self, \"the mind grasping at that false 'I'.\" By analyzing the sense of \"I\" and it's logical contradictions, it's seemingly true existence is seen through, which \"destroys the continuum of the subjective mind grasping it. What continues is a wisdom mind.\"\n\nAccording to Patrick Jennings, \nThis procedure is described in chapter 23, \"The person Lacks Intrinsic Nature\", of volume three of the Lamrim Chenmo, and entails four steps: \n\nTsongkhapa saw emptiness as a consequence of \"pratītyasamutpāda\" (dependent arising), the teaching that no \"dharma\" (\"thing\") has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence on other \"dharmas\". According to Tsonghkhapa, dependent-arising and emptiness are inseparable.\n\nTsongkhapa's view on \"ultimate reality\" is condensed in the short text \"In Praise of Dependent Arising\" c.q. \"In Praise of Relativity\" c.q. \"The Essence of Eloquency\". It states that \"things\" \"do\" exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefore void of inherent existence:\nThis means that conventionally things \"do\" exist, and that there is no use in denying that. But it also means that ultimately those things have no 'existence of their own', and that cognizing them as such results from cognitive operations, not from some unchangeable essence. Tsongkhapa:\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, emptiness is empty of inherent existence: emptiness only exists nominally and conventionally. Emptiness is co-dependently arisen as a quality of conventional phenomenon and is itself a conventional phenomenon. There is no \"transcendental ground,\" and \"ultimate reality\" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind. Emptiness is an ultimate truth (a fact which applies to all possible phenomena, in all possible worlds), but it is not an ultimate phenomenon or ultimate reality (something which has always existed, is self-created, and is self-sustaining). It is also not a \"Tao\" or a primal substance from which all other things arise. Buddhapalita: \nSusan Kahn further explains:\nA prominent and important feature of the approach is their use of the \"non-affirming negation\". A non-affirming negation is a negation which does not leave something in the place of what has been negated. For instance, when one says that a Buddhist should not drink alcohol, they are not affirming that a Buddhist should, in fact, drink something else. One is merely negating the consumption of alcohol under a particular circumstance.\n\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, for the the philosophical position of emptiness is itself a non-affirming negation, since emptiness is a \"lack of inherent existence.\" One is not affirming anything in the place of that absence of inherence. It is not the presence of some other quality. If one were to describe emptiness as the presence of some quality -for example, a \"voidness\" or a \"thusness\" - it would linguistically and philosophically contradict the nature of the object which it is attempting to characterize.\n\nThe dawning realization of emptiness can be frightening, arousing \"fear of annihilation.\" Some Mahayana sutras therefore argue that the so-called storehouse consciousness or mind-basis-of-all consciousness was taught by the Buddha \"provisionally, for the benefit of those who could be helped by believing in its existence but who would be harmed by hearing the teachings about emptiness.\"\n\nTsongkhapa adheres to this provisional adherence of the storehouse-consciousness, but rejects it as faulty once one has gained insight into emptiness. He presents the alternative viewpoint of \"the mere 'I'\" which carries karma from life-to-life and uses other techniques to overcome the fear of annihilation.\n\nSam van Schaik says that Tsongkhapa \"wanted to create something new\" and that the early Gandenpas defined themselves by responding to accusations from the established schools:\nTsongkhapa emphasised a strong monastic Sangha. With the founding of the Ganden monastery in 1409, he laid down the basis for what was later named the Gelug (\"virtuous ones\") order. At the time of the foundation of the Ganden monastery, his followers became to be known as \"Gandenbas.\" Tsongkhapa himself never announced the establishment of a new monastic order.\n\nAfter Tsongkhapa had founded Ganden Monastery in 1409, it became his main seat. He had many students, among whom Gyaltsab Je (1364–1431), Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama (1385–1438), Togden Jampal Gyatso, Jamyang Choje, Jamchenpa Sherap Senge, and the 1st Dalai Lama (1391–1474), were the most outstanding. After Tsongkhapa's passing his teachings were held and kept by Gyaltsab Dharma Rinchen and Khedrub Gelek Pälsang. From then on, his lineage has been held by the Ganden Tripas, the throne-holders of Ganden Monastery, among whom the present one is Thubten Nyima Lungtok Tenzin Norbu, the 102nd Ganden Tripa.\n\nAfter the founding of Ganden Monastery by Tsongkhapa, Drepung Monastery was founded by Jamyang Choje, Sera Monastery was founded by Chöje Shakya Yeshe and the 1st Dalai Lama founded Tashilhunpo Monastery. Many Gelug monasteries were built throughout Tibet but also in China and Mongolia. He spent some time as a hermit in Pabonka Hermitage, which was built during Songsten Gampo times, approximately 8 kilometres north west of Lhasa. Today, it is also part of Sera.\n\nAmong the many lineage holders of the Gelugpas there are the successive incarnations of the Panchen Lama as well as the Chagkya Dorje Chang, Ngachen Könchok Gyaltsen, Kyishö Tulku Tenzin Thrinly, Jamyang Shepa, Phurchok Jampa Rinpoche, Jamyang Dewe Dorje, Takphu Rinpoche, Khachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, Trijang Rinpoche, Domo Geshe Rinpoche, and many others.\n\nThe annual Tibetan prayer festival Monlam Prayer Festival was established by Tsongkhapa. There he offered service to ten thousand monks. The establishment of the Great Prayer Festival is seen as one of his Four Great Deeds. It celebrates the miraculous deeds of Gautama Buddha.\n\nAccording to Karl Brunnholzl, Tsongkhapa's Madhyamaka has become widely influential in the western understanding of Madhyamaka:\nSome of the greatest subsequent Tibetan scholars have become famous for their own works either defending or attacking Tsongkhapa's views.\n\nTsongkhapa's rejection of Svatantrika has been criticised within the Tibetan tradition, qualifying it as Tsongkhapa's own invention, \"novelties that are not found in any Indian sources,\" and therefore \"a major flaw\" and \"unwarranted and unprecedented within the greater Madhyamaka tradition.\"\n\nAccording to Thupten Jinpa, the Gelugpa school sees Tsongkhapa's ideas as mystical revelations from the bodhisattva Manjusri, whereas Gorampa accused him of being inspired by a demon. Brunnhölzl further notes that, according to his Karma Kagyü (Mahamudra) critics, Tsongkhapa was mistaken in some regards in his understanding of emptiness, taking it as a real existent, and thereby hindering the liberation of his followers. According to Van Schaik, these criticisms furthered the establishment of the Gelupga as an independent school:\nKarl Brunnholzl notes that Tsongkhapa's \"object of negation,\" the \"phantom notion of 'real existence' different from the 'table that is established through valid cognition',\" is called a \"hornlike object of negation\" by his critics: Tsongkhapa first puts a horn on the head of the rabbit, and then removes it again, a maneuver which \"affects neither the rabbit's existence nor your taking the rabbit for a rabbit.\" According to Brunnholzl,\n\nTsongkhapa promoted the study of logic, encouraged formal debates as part of Dharma studies, and instructed disciples in the Guhyasamāja, Kalacakra, and Hevajra Tantras. Tsongkhapa's writings comprise eighteen volumes, with the largest amount being on Guhyasamāja tantra. These 18 volumes contain hundreds of titles relating to all aspects of Buddhist teachings and clarify some of the most difficult topics of Sutrayana and Vajrayana teachings. Tsongkhapa's main treatises and commentaries on Madhyamaka are based on the tradition descended from Nagarjuna as elucidated by Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti.\n\nMajor works among them are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

His most celebrated work, \"At the Mind's Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and Its Realities\" (1966), suggests that torture was \"the essence\" of the Third Reich. Other notable works included \"On Aging\" (1968) and \"On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death\" (1976). Améry killed himself in 1978.\n\nFormerly a philosophy and literature student in Vienna, Améry's participation in organized resistance against the Nazi occupation of Belgium resulted in his detainment and torture by the German Gestapo at Fort Breendonk, and several years of imprisonment in concentration camps. Améry survived internments in Auschwitz and Buchenwald, and was finally liberated at Bergen-Belsen in 1945. After the war he settled in Belgium.\n\nJean Améry was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1912, to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. His father was killed in action in World War I in 1916. Améry was raised as a Roman Catholic by his mother. Eventually, Améry and his mother returned to Vienna, where he enrolled in university to study literature and philosophy, but economic necessity kept him from regular pursuit of studies there.\n\nWhile Améry's family was \"estranged from its Jewish origins, assimilated and intermarried\", this alienation itself, in the context of Nazi occupation, informed much of his thought: \"I wanted by all means to be an anti-Nazi, that most certainly, but of my own accord.\"\n\nThe Nuremberg Laws of 1935, the text of which he soon came to know by heart, convinced Améry that Germany had essentially passed a sentence of death on all Jews. His \"The Necessity and Impossibility of Being a Jew\" speaks to this inner conflict as to his identity. He suggests that while his personal identity, the identity of his own childhood past, is distinctly Christian, he feels himself nonetheless a Jew in another sense, the sense of a Jewishness \"without God, without history, without messianic-national hope\".\n\nIn 1938, when the Nazis were welcomed into Austria and the country joined with Germany into a \"Greater Reich\", Améry fled to France, and then to Belgium with his Jewish wife, whom he had chosen in opposition to his mother's wishes. Ironically, he was initially deported back to France by the Belgians as a German alien, and wound up interned in the south.\n\nAfter escaping from the camp at Gurs, he returned to Belgium where he joined the Resistance movement.\n\nInvolved in the distribution of anti-military propaganda to the German occupying forces, Améry was captured by the Nazis in July 1943 and routinely tortured at the Belgian Gestapo center at Fort Breendonk. When it was established that there was no information to be extracted from him, he was \"demoted\" from political prisoner to Jew, and shipped to Auschwitz.\n\nLacking any trade skills, he was assigned to the harshest physical labors, building the I.G. Farben factory at Auschwitz III, the Buna-Monowitz labor camp. In the face of the Soviet invasion in the following year, he was evacuated first to Buchenwald and then to Bergen-Belsen, where he was liberated by the British army in April 1945.\n\nAfter the war, the former Hanns Mayer changed his name to Jean Améry (the surname being a French-sounding anagram of his family name) in order to symbolize his dissociation from German culture and his alliance with French culture. He lived in Brussels, working as a culture journalist for German language newspapers in Switzerland. He refused to publish in Germany or Austria for many years, publishing only in Switzerland. He did not write at all of his experiences in the death camps until 1964, when, at the urging of German poet Helmut Heißenbüttel, he wrote his book \"Jenseits von Schuld und Sühne\" (\"Beyond Guilt and Atonement\"). It was later translated into English by Sidney and Stella P. Rosenfeld as \"At the Mind's Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and its Realities\".\n\nIn 1976 Améry published the book \"On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death.\" He took his own life by overdose of sleeping pills in 1978.\n\nThe publication of \"At the Mind's Limits\", Améry's exploration of the Holocaust and the nature of the Third Reich, made him one of the most highly regarded of Holocaust writers. In comparing the Nazis to a government of sadism, Améry suggests that it is the sadist's nature to want \"to nullify the world\". For a Nazi torturer,\n\n[a] slight pressure by the tool-wielding hand is enough to turn the other – along with his head, in which are perhaps stored Kant and Hegel, and all nine symphonies, and \"The World as Will and Representation\" – into a shrill squealing piglet at slaughter.\n\nAméry's efforts to preserve the memory of the Holocaust focused on the terror and horror of the events in a phenomenological and philosophical way, with what he characterized as \"a scant inclination to be conciliatory\". His explorations of his experiences and the meaning and legacy of Nazi-era suffering were aimed not at resolving the events finally into \"the cold storage of history\", but rather keeping the subject alive so that it would not be lost to posterity, as an abstraction or mere text. As he wrote in his 1976 preface to \"Beyond Guilt and Atonement\":\n\nI do not have [clarity] today, and I hope that I never will. Clarification would amount to disposal, settlement of the case, which can then be placed in the files of history. My book is meant to prevent precisely this. For nothing is resolved, nothing is settled, no remembering has become mere memory.\n\nWith the prize money that the Viennese writer Robert Menasse received for the Austrian State Prize (1999) he re-founded the “Jean Améry–Preis für Europäische Essayistik”, whose winners were Lothar Baier, Barbara Sichtermann (1985), Mathias Greffrath (1988), Reinhard Merkel (1991), Franz Schuh (2000), Doron Rabinovici (2002), Michael Jeismann (2004), Journalist, Drago Jančar (2007), Imre Kertész (2009), Dubravka Ugrešić (2012), Adam Zagajewski (2016) and Karl-Markus Gauß (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1058693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058693", "title": "Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development", "text": "Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development\n\nLawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago in 1958 and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.\n\nThe theory holds that moral reasoning, the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor. Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime, a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.\n\nThe six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels of morality: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional morality.\n\nFor his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma, and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion, and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.\n\nThere have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly \"post hoc\" rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists) of essentially intuitive decisions.\n\nNevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.\n\nKohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.\n\nKohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.\n\nThe understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.\n\nThe pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.\n\nIn Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. \"The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again.\" The worse the punishment for the act is, the more \"bad\" the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is \"egocentric\", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is \"deference to superior power or prestige\".\n\nAn example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.\n\nStage two (self-interest driven) expresses the \"what's in it for me\" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a \"You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours\" mentality. The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.\n\nAn example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, \"what's in it for me?\" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.\n\nThe conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.\n\nIn Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a \"good boy\" or \"good girl\" to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the \"golden rule\". \"I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me.\" Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that \"they mean well\".\n\nIn Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.\n\nThe post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual's own perspective may take precedence over society's view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.\n\nSome theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.\n\nIn Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet \"the greatest good for the greatest number of people\". This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.\n\nIn Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another's shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level. Touro College Researcher Arthur P. Sullivan helped support the accuracy of Kohlberg's first five stages through data analysis, but could not provide statistical evidence for the existence of Kohlberg's sixth stage. Therefore, it is difficult to define/recognize as a concrete stage in moral development.\n\nIn his empirical studies of individuals throughout their life, Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality. In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to five, that shared characteristics of both. In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong. Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.\n\nKohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning. Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage, however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.\n\nKohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral \"reasonings\" adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the \"form and structure\" of moral arguments is independent of the \"content\" of those arguments, a position he calls \"formalism\".\n\nKohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.\n\nKohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as \"moral universalism\"): there can be no relativism. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.\n\nAccording to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.\n\nProgress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called \"justice operation\". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: \"equality\", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and \"reciprocity\", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is \"reversibility\", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as \"moral musical chairs\").\n\nKnowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's \"view of persons\" and their \"social perspective level\", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The \"view of persons\" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric. Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.\n\nKohlberg established the \"Moral Judgement Interview\" in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.\n\nA dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma: \"Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe\".\n\nOne criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.\n\nKohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures. Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.<ref name=\"kohlberg/gilligan\"></ref>\n\nAnother criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e. stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e. stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.\n\nOther psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered \"post hoc\" rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.\n\nKohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the \"Defining Issues Test\" (\"DIT\") created in 1979 by James Rest, originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview. Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's. It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of \"post-conventional thinking\". In 1999 the \"DIT\" was revised as the \"DIT-2\"; the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required, such as divinity, politics, and medicine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13045571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13045571", "title": "Mental prayer", "text": "Mental prayer\n\nMental prayer is a form of prayer recommended in the Catholic Church whereby one loves God through dialogue, meditating on God's words, and contemplation of Christ's face. It is distinguished from vocal prayers which use set prayers, although mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. And no prayer is purely vocal, as it has traditionally been defined: \"Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God.\"\n\nOne of the foremost writers on mental prayer, St. Teresa of Avila, stated: \"Contemplative prayer [oración mental] is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us.\" Here the emphasis is on love rather than on thought.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, meditation and contemplation which take place in mental prayer are \"major expressions of the life of prayer\" in the Christian tradition. The practice of mental prayer is necessary for reaching the goal of Christian perfection, said Mother (Saint) Teresa of Calcutta. \"Holiness is impossible without it.\" St. Ignatius of Loyola, the Church's patron of retreats, popularized meditation and contemplation through his thirty-day retreat or \"Spiritual Exercises\", which he customarily administered to laypersons.\n\nMental prayer was defined by Fr. John Hardon as a \"form of prayer in which the sentiments expressed are one's own and not those of another person. Mental prayer is accomplished by internal acts of the mind and affections and is either simple meditation or contemplation.\" Prayer is mental when the thoughts and affections of the soul are not expressed in a previously determined formula. The function of mental prayer is to transform the mind and thereby effect a change in dispositions and in the heart. Such transformation is a lifelong process. Adolphe Tanquerey distinguishes between vocal prayer, which is expressed by words or gestures, and mental prayer \"which takes place wholly within the soul.\" Mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. Mental prayer can be divided into meditation, more active in reflections, and contemplation, more quiet and gazeful.\n\nJohn Cassian (5th century) and John Climacus (6th century) discussed the ways of mental prayer, and many Fathers of the Church gave their own recommendations for it: St. Augustine of Hippo, St. John Chrysostom, St. Jerome, St. Basil, St. Boethius, and St. Bernard of Clairvaux.\n\nFrom before the middle of the twelfth century, the Carthusians had times set apart for mental prayer. Early in the sixteenth century, the Dominican chapter of Milan prescribed mental prayer for half an hour during the morning and the evening. Among the Franciscans, there is mention of methodical mental prayer about the middle of that century. Among the Carmelites, there was no regulation for mental prayer until Saint Teresa of Avila introduced it, practicing it for two hours daily. In the mid-sixteenth century Saint Ignatius of Loyola in his \"Spiritual Exercises\", which he used with laypersons, taught methods of both meditating on one's life and of contemplating the Gospel accounts of Jesus' life, as a means of becoming more like Christ. His method and that of St. Sulpice have helped spread the habit of meditating beyond the cloister.\n\nSome modern authors recommend that this prayer be called \"interior prayer\". Fr. Jacques Philippe said: \"It would be better to say interior prayer instead of mental prayer, because in our modern culture, the word \"mental\" is associated with thoughts – as something cerebral – whereas this form of prayer is more an affair of the heart, instead of reflection. St. Teresa of Avila said that it is not an act of thinking much, but of loving much.\"\n\nMeditation consists of two operations – one belongs to the thinking faculty which applies the imagination, memory, and understanding to consider some truth, principle, fact or mystery; the other is dependent on the will with a view to exciting proper spiritual emotions, to ask for the good proposed by the mind, and resolve on some act or course of action regarded as God's will and as a means of union with God. To some degree, this has always been practiced by God-fearing persons. According to St. Teresa, the person in this activity is like a gardener, who, with much labour, draws the water up from the depths of the well to water the plants and flowers.\nSaint Mother Teresa said:\nWe must never forget that we are bound to perfection and should aim ceaselessly for it. The practice of mental prayer is necessary to reach that goal. Because it is the breath of life for our soul, holiness is impossible without it. It is only in mental prayer and spiritual reading that we cultivate the gift of prayer. Mental prayer is greatly fostered by simplicity – that is forgetfulness of self and of the body and of the sense, and by frequent aspirations that feed our prayer.\n\n\"He who neglects mental prayer,\" affirms Saint Teresa of Avila, \"needs no devil to carry him to hell. He brings himself there with his own hands.\" Her fellow Carmelite Saint John of the Cross also said, \"Without the aid of mental prayer, the soul cannot triumph over the forces of the demon.\"\n\nSaint Alphonsus Liguori, the Catholic Church's Doctor of moral theology, in his work \"Necessity and Power of Prayer, The Great Means of Salvation and Perfection\", explained: \"Mental prayer is the blessed furnace in which souls are inflamed with the love of God. All the saints have become saints by mental prayer.\" And, recommending its importance, he said: \"It is morally impossible for him who neglects meditation to live without sin.\" He added that, because of its incompatibility with sin, nobody can continue the practice of mental prayer in the state of mortal sin. They will either repent or quit the practice of mental prayer. He saw it as a means of making available the graces needed for a persevering faith.\n\nBenedict XVI, speaking to priests, said of prayer and meditation: \"Spending time in God's presence in prayer is a real pastoral priority; it is not an addition to pastoral work: being before the Lord is a pastoral priority and in the final analysis, the most important.\" In the Foreword of his book \"Jesus of Nazareth\", Benedict XVI emphasized that \"everything depends\" on \"intimate friendship with Jesus.\"\n\nPope Francis said: \"The spiritual life is fed, nourished, by prayer and is expressed outwardly through mission: inhaling and exhaling. When we inhale, by prayer, we receive the fresh air of the Holy Spirit. When exhaling this air, we announce Jesus Christ risen by the same Spirit.\"\n\nJohn Paul II, in his program for the new millennium, said in his message for the 42nd \"World Day of Prayer\":\n\nSince sanctity is for everyone, according to Catholic doctrine, anyone can learn mental prayer. St. Therese of the Lisieux learned mental prayer when she was eleven years old. \"Mental prayer is not just for priests and nuns, but is for everyone. The youngest of children are capable of reaching great heights through mental prayer,\" is the teaching of the Franciscan Friar Minors.\n\nPope Francis said: \"The Lord speaks to us through the Scriptures and in our prayer. Let us learn to keep silence before him, as we meditate upon the Gospel.\"\n\nPrayer means dealing with someone, a person, the living God. All prayer, even prayer of petition, is described by the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" as an openness, a response to God's Spirit speaking within us. \"The Holy Spirit ... keeps the memory of Christ alive in his Church at prayer. ...It is the Face of the Lord that we seek and desire; it is his Word that we want to hear and keep.\" The \"Catechism\" quotes Guigo the Carthusian: \"Seek in reading and you will find in meditating; knock in mental prayer and it will be opened to you by contemplation.\" As John Paul II said, \"We shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person and the assurance which he gives us: I am with you!\" And Benedict XVI said: \"Being Christian is ... the encounter with an event, a person.\" There is an I, a someone who wants to be with us, someone who listens, feels, sees, talks, and interacts with the one praying.\n\n\"Friendly dealing\" \"(tratar de amistad)\" is the literal translation of St. Teresa's definition of mental prayer: \"Tratar de amistad, estando muchas veces tratando a solas con Quien sabemos nos ama.\" The literal translation is: \"Friendly dealing, many times dealing one-on-one with Him whom we know loves us. And this person has a face which we can contemplate, a face that is a singular manifestation of his person.\"\nThe first important principle is: \"What matters in prayer is not what we do but what God does in us during those moments,\" said Jacques Philippe in \"Time for God\". \"The essential act in prayer is, at bottom, to place one's self in God's presence and to remain there. ...This presence, which is that of the living God, is active, vivifying. It heals and sanctifies us. We cannot sit before a fire without getting warm.\"\n\nAllowing God to be fully present is key to the highest levels of prayer, according to John Paul II. \"In prayer, the true protagonist is God,\" he said in\" Crossing the Threshold of Hope.\" \"Man achieves the fullness of prayer not when he expresses himself, but when he lets God be most fully present in prayer.\" The biblical reason for this, according to John Paul II, is: \"We do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings\" (cf. Rom 8:26). As Mother Teresa said, \"In vocal prayer we speak to God, in mental prayer he speaks to us. It is then that God pours himself into us.\" \"Placing oneself in God's presence and remaining there\" is the essential act of prayer, according to Philippe. St. Ignatius of Loyola has as a basic principle of his \"Spiritual Exercises\" that \"the Lord communicates himself to the well-disposed person.\" \nThe basic decision then is to \"make time for the Lord, with the firm determination not to give up.\" The recommended length of time per day varies from \"a few minutes\" (Friars Minor.org), \"30 minutes\" (Eugene Boylan), \"several minutes\" (Josemaria Escriva), \"one hour\" (Francis of Sales), \"minimum of half an hour in front of the Blessed Sacrament\" (Alphonsus Liguori). The beginningcatholic.com recommends starting with 5–10 minutes.\n\nThe second fundamental principle, according to Jacques Philippe is \"love is above everything else.\" The \"Catechism\" draws on Ephesians 3:16f in saying: \"The Father strengthens our inner being with power through his Spirit 'that Christ may dwell in (our) hearts through faith' and we may be 'grounded in love.'\" As St. Teresa explained, in prayer it does not matter as much to think as to love. This is in accordance with the commandment that Jesus aptly called \"the greatest\": Love God with your whole heart, your whole soul, your whole mind and your whole strength. \"Loving in the first place is \"allowing oneself to be loved\",\" said Philippe. Benedict XVI stressed in \"Deus caritas est\": \"Anyone who wishes to give love \"must also receive love\" as a gift. ...One can become a source from which rivers of living water flow. Yet to become such a source, one must constantly drink anew from the original source, which is Jesus Christ, from whose pierced heart flows the love of God\" (italics added). Benedict XVI emphasized that this is \"the heart of the Gospel, the central nucleus of Christianity\": \"In this is love, not that we loved God but that \"he loved us\"\" (1 Jn 4:10; italics added). \"We have come to believe in God's love\" is, Benedict says, the fundamental decision of a Christian's life.\n\nJoseph Ratzinger emphasized that sanctity is \"nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally, prayer is to place oneself in God's presence and to allow him to love us,\" says Philippe. And with this, the basic attitude of a Christian is humility coming from a knowledge of his own powerlessness and sinfulness in comparison to the grandeur of God. Thus Jesus criticized the self-praise of the Pharisees which showed them as people who \"trusted themselves that they were righteous,\" while he praised the tax-collector's petition for mercy, because \"he who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\nThe Christian's love increases as a response to the love of God. \"Contemplative prayer,\" according to the \"Catechism\", \"is the prayer of the child of God, of the forgiven sinner who agrees to welcome the love by which he is loved and who wants to respond to it by loving even more.\" St. Teresa of Avila said that my daily prayers should revolve around \"giving myself totally to the Lord.\"\n\n\nSt. Francis of Sales said: \"Begin all prayer, whether mental or vocal, by an act of the Presence of God. If you observe this rule strictly, you will soon see how useful it is.\" He says that God is everywhere and is in our hearts and souls. Thus, \"a blind man when in the presence of his prince will preserve a reverential attitude if told that the king is there, although unable to see him.\"\n\nMother Teresa said that \"I always begin my prayer in silence, for it is in the silence of the heart that God speaks.\" Her \"simple path\" states: \"The fruit of silence is PRAYER. The fruit of prayer is FAITH. The fruit of faith is LOVE. The fruit of love is SERVICE. The fruit of service is PEACE.\"\n\nIgnatius of Loyola began each of his \"Spiritual Exercises\" with a \"Preparatory Prayer\" to place oneself in the presence of God, and closed each with a \"Colloquy.\" Examples of elaborated forms have since arisen:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3554409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3554409", "title": "Most royal candidate theory", "text": "Most royal candidate theory\n\nThe most royal candidate theory is the proposition that the winning candidate in United States presidential elections will be the candidate with the greatest percentage of \"royal blood\" in his or her pedigree. The theory was first publicized by Harold Brooks-Baker, who promoted it during several election cycles, ending with the United States presidential election, 2004.\n\nEvery four years for a number of election cycles, Harold Brooks-Baker publicized his theory during the Presidential election campaign, touring the talk circuit and expounding upon it. He gave examples of presidents whose losing opponents did not have royal blood (Ronald Reagan vs Walter Mondale), or where the winner simply had \"more\" royalty (John F. Kennedy vs Richard Nixon). Based on his theory, Brooks-Baker predicted that John Kerry would defeat the incumbent president, George W. Bush, in the United States presidential election, 2004, because while the candidates shared a number of royal bloodlines, Kerry had more royal ancestors than Bush. However, Bush was re-elected, and Brooks-Baker died a few months later.\n\nThe theory received fresh interest in 2012, when BridgeAnne d'Avignon, a twelve-year-old schoolgirl from California, claimed to have traced the ancestors of all except one of the 43 presidents back to John, King of England (1166-1216, reigned 1199-1216). According to d'Avignon, every president from George Washington to Barack Obama is a descendant of King John, with the sole exception of Martin van Buren.\n\nBrooks-Baker was not known for the reliability of his information. His obituary in \"The Daily Telegraph\" would say of him, \"[H]is great advantage for journalists was that he was always available to make an arresting comment; his disadvantage was that he was often wrong.\" Critics of the theory point out that perhaps a third of all Americans may be descended from King John, and that the odds of being distantly related to other royalty are even higher. This is an effect of a phenomenon known as pedigree collapse, which occurs due to the doubling of the number of a person's ancestors with each generation. In theory, each person has over one thousand ancestors after ten generations, and one million after twenty, far exceeding the number of persons actually living in most regions at any point in time. In fact, most people are descended from the same ancestors multiple times through different lines, while anyone living at the time of King John could have tens of millions of descendants in the present day.\n\nProponents of the theory may counter by noting that, even if one third of all Americans are descended from King John, two thirds are not; therefore one would not expect most presidents to count him among their ancestors. However, the leading candidates for President in each election cycle do not represent a random sampling of the American population. Nearly all of the presidents and their opponents have had English ancestors, greatly increasing the likelihood of their descent from King John or other British monarchs.\n\nThere remains a factual question as to whether the number of each candidate's royal ancestors or percentage of \"royal blood\" can be accurately estimated without being able to trace every branch of the candidate's family tree for an indefinite length. However, the relevance of such descent is also questioned due to the relatively small degree of inheritance a person receives from such distant ancestors. For instance, a person ten generations removed from a royal ancestor would have less than one thousandth of that ancestor's DNA, and this amount would be halved with each subsequent generation. Thus, even if being a twenty-seventh generation descendant of King John could confer some advantage on a presidential contender, it is unclear how it would have any measurable effect.\n\nThe central claim, that until 2004 the winner was always the most royal, is called into question by four instances in which successive elections were contested by the same two candidates, with different results. In 1800, 1828, 1840 and 1892, the victorious candidate had lost to the same opponent in the previous election.\n"}

Nothing is known about his early life. He was incepted as Master of Theology at Paris in the year 1333-4, where he received the title of \"Doctor Pacificus\" (The Peaceful Doctor) on account of his suave and tranquil mode of lecturing. Bonet took part in the heated dispute concerning John XXII's view on the beatific vision which was finally settled by the decree of his successor, Benedict XII, \"Benedictus Deus\".\n\nHe was a member of the papal embassy tasked by Benedict XII to prepare a diplomatic mission to Kublai Khan, in response to the khan's petition to Benedict XII for new labourers in the Franciscan missions of Asia. The pope tasked four Franciscans: John of Florence, afterwards Bishop of Bisignano in Calabria, Nicholas Bonet, Nicholas of Molano, and Gregory of Hungary. The delegates, bearing letters from the pope to the khan, left Avignon towards the end of the year 1338 and returned to Avignon in 1354. Bonet did not join the mission himself, because he was consecrated Bishop of Malta by Pope Clement VI on November 27, 1342. It is assumed that Nicolas died in 1343, since the bull appointing his successor mentions his death.\n\nAll four of Nicolas's surviving works have been printed in the sixteenth century. They are his \"Metaphysica,\" \"Philosophia Naturalis,\" \"Praedicamenta\" and\"Theologia naturalis\".\n\nOlder histories mention some other works, including a treatise on the immaculate conception, a treatise on the formal distinction and his commentary on Peter Lombard's \"Sentences\". Since none of these works survive, their attribution is uncertain.\n\nMetaphysics\n\nMost of Nicolas's metaphysics is contained in his \"Metaphysica\". Unlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, Nicolas did not simply write a commentary on Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\". Instead, he opted to provide a systematic order to his \"Metaphysica\", departing from the most general principles and working towards specifics. His main sources of inspiration for doing so were Aristotle himself and Avicenna. It has therefore been argued that Nicolas's \"Metaphysica\" was the first systematic treatise on metaphysics, preceding Francisco Suárez by multiple centuries. Many of the topics discussed belong to the core of Scotist metaphysics and medieval metaphysics in general: the formal distinction, the subject of metaphysics, the object of the intellect and the different properties of being. Recent scholarship has drawn attention to whether or not his metaphysics can be seen as a supertranscendental science and Nicolas's conception of unity.\n\nNatural philosophy\n\nBoth Nicolas's \"Praedicamenta\" and \"Philosophia Naturalis\" contain an atomistic account of nature, a view Nicolas shared with Gerardus Odonis.\n\n\n"}

Xanthippe also transmits Socrates’ dialogue with the university teachers of philosophy Cyborg (Stephen Hawking), Pope (John Paul II), Unabomber (Theodore Kaczynski) and Madonna (Madonna Ciccone).\n\nIn The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age, Himanen is trying to understand the core of informationalism, the post-industrialist paradigm, extending the ideas of Manuel Castells' \"Information Age\". As an alternative to the industrial-capitalist protestant work ethic he proposes a hacker ethic as something like a cyber communitarianism.

{"id": "29027537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29027537", "title": "Philosophy education", "text": "Philosophy education\n\nPhilosophy education is the practice of teaching and learning philosophy along with the associated scholarly research. It is not philosophy of education, nor the philosophical study of education in general.\n\nEducation in the subject is usually divided into 4 main stages: pre-school (i.e. pre-primary; e.g. kindergarten) and primary education levels (e.g. elementary school), lower (e.g. middle school) and upper secondary education level (e.g. high school), tertiary (higher) education level (e.g. college, university), and post-tertiary education level. Sometimes the stage referred to as \"post-secondary non-tertiary\" is also included (in a fashion similar to the ISCED levels).\nNot all countries provide study of philosophy at all levels and in many the subject is virtually absent from the entire curriculum.\n\nIn the United States of America, philosophy is not generally taught at the pre-college level. However, through the movements of critical thinking and Philosophy for Children aspects of philosophy teaching have entered the curriculum. In recent years, some in the media have promoted the idea of introducing philosophy to American schools as an antidote to perceived political and societal dysfunction. In Canada, philosophy is not generally taught in public schools prior to university. In the United Kingdom it is possible to do A-levels in philosophy.\n\nIn many other European countries philosophy is part of the high school curriculum, such as for example in Austria, Croatia, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Poland, and mainly Spain. In Germany the subject ethics has been introduced in more and more parts since the 1970s. In Croatia the subject ethics can be taken instead of religious education which mainly focuses on Catholic tradition. Spain is the most clear example of a philosophy education. In Secondary school all the students must take a little introduction to ethics, but it is during the sixth form, known there as 'bachillerato', where it is compulsory to take philosophy and citizenship in the first course, as well as history of philosophy in the second course in order to apply for university or just to get the title. University-level philosophy courses are widespread and are usually thought to have the longest tradition in the subject due to the historical ascription for the invention of philosophy as a separate discipline to the philosophers of Ancient Greece.\n\nPhilosophy education has a long tradition in some of the Arab states. According to a UNESCO-led poll, philosophy is taught at secondary level in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Mauritania, Qatar, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Yemen. In most Arab countries the subject is taught at university (higher education) level. However, there are exceptions, like Oman and Saudi Arabia, where philosophy is entirely absent at most educational levels.\n\nPhilosophy education is traditionally available in most of Asia since the continent gave birth to the schools of Eastern philosophy. The 20th and early 21st century saw the increased interest in the field (especially in Western philosophy) in the Asian continent, with India, China and especially South Korea and Japan as major contemporary academic and research hubs. However, broad regional and interstate differences apply.\n\nIn Brazil, philosophy is part of the high school curriculum since 2008.\n\nTheoretical questions concerning the teaching of philosophy in school have been debated at least since Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The modern debate in Germany in the 1970s gave rise to two competing approaches: the more traditional, text-oriented approach by Wulff D. Rehfus and the more modern, dialogue-oriented approach by Ekkehard Martens. Newer approaches have been developed by Karel van der Leeuw and Pieter Mostert as well as Roland W. Henke. A similar divide between traditionalists and modernists is to be found in France, with the proponents Jacques Muglioni and Jacqueline Russ on the one side and France Rollin and Michel Tozzi on the other. In Italy, philosophy education is traditionally historically oriented in the sense of history of ideas.\nTheoretical problems of philosophy education at college and university level are discussed in articles in the journal Teaching Philosophy.\n\nAmong the didactic methods in philosophy are the Socratic method and Hermeneutics. The pedagogic side of philosophy teaching is also of note to researchers in the field and philosophers of education.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Certifications are very common in fields such as aviation, construction, technology, environment, and other industrial sectors, as well as healthcare, business, real estate, and finance.\nAccording to \"The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs\" (1997) by Phillip Barnhart, \"certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job\" and they provide protential employers with \"an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience\".\n\nCertification is different from professional licensure. In the United States, licenses are typically issued by state agencies, whereas certifications are usually awarded by professional societies or educational institutes. Obtaining a certificate is voluntary in some fields, but in others, certification from a government-accredited agency may be legally required to perform certain jobs or tasks. In other countries, licenses are typically granted by professional societies or universities and require a certificate after about three to five years and so on thereafter. The assessment process for certification may be more comprehensive than that of licensure, though sometimes the assessment process is very similar or even the same, despite differing in terms of legal status.\n\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defines the standard for being a certifying agency as meeting the following two requirements:\n\nThe Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE) is a U.S.-based organization that sets standards for the accreditation of personnel certification and certificate programs based on the \"Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing\", a joint publication of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Many members of the Association of Test Publishers (ATP) are also certification organizations.\n\nThere are three general types of certification. Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide.\n\nCorporate, or \"internal\" certifications, are made by a corporation or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability – to other corporations, for example – it is the most simple to develop.\n\nProduct-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the information technology (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of software or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products. Another example could be the certifications issued for shipping personnel, which are under international standards even for the recognition of the certification body, under the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\n\nThe most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and protect the public, a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of accountancy software but for general work in the profession.\n\nMany universities grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational program. The curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. Many professional certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. Many other professional certificates offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses to complete the program. Some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a baccalaureate major in the same field. The typical professional certificate program is between 200–300 class-hours in size. It is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. Most professional certificate programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. A few universities put some of their professional certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.\n\nSome of the more commonly offered professional certificates include:\n\n\"Advanced professional certificates\" are professional credentials designed to help professionals enhance their job performance and marketability in their respective fields. In many other countries, certificates are qualifications in higher education. In the United States, a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain vocational subject. Certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements.\n\nAn advanced professional certificate is a result of an educational process designed for individuals. Certificates are designed for both newcomers to the industry as well as seasoned professionals. Certificates are awarded by an educational program or academic institution. Completion of a certificate program indicates completion of a course or series of courses with a specific concentration that is different from an educational degree program. Course content for an advanced certificate is set forth through a variety of sources i.e. faculty, committee, instructors, and other subject matter experts in a related field. The end goal of an advanced professional certificate is so that professionals may demonstrate knowledge of course content at the end of a set period in time.\n\nInstitutions that offer advance professional certificates in various fields and industries include:\n\nThere are many professional bodies for accountants and auditors throughout the world; some of them are legally recognized in their jurisdictions.\nPublic accountants are the accountancy and control experts that are legally certified in different jurisdictions to work in public practices, certifying accounts as statutory auditors, eventually selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses. Today, however, many work within private corporations, financial industry, and government bodies.\n\nCf. Accountancy qualifications and regulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAviators are certified through theoretical and in-flight examinations. Requirements for certifications are quite equal in most countries and are regulated by each National Aviation Authority. The existing certificates or pilot licenses are:\n\nLicensing in these categories require not only examinations but also a minimum number of flight hours. All categories are available for Fixed-Wing Aircraft (airplanes) and Rotatory-Wing Aircraft (helicopters). Within each category, aviators may also obtain certifications in:\nUsually, aviators must be certified also in their log books for the type and model of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Currency checks as well as regular medical check-ups with a frequency of 6 months, 12 months, or 36 months, depending on the type of flying permitted, are obligatory. An aviator can fly only if holding:\n\nIn Europe, the ANSP, ATCO & ANSP technicians are certified according to ESARRs (according to EU regulation 2096/2005 \"Common Requirements\").\n\n\nIn the United States, several communications certifications are conferred by the Electronics Technicians Association.\n\nCertification is often used in the professions of software engineering and information technology.\n\n\nCPCM (Certified Professional Contract Manager) conferred by the National Contract Management Association.\n\nConferred by the International Dance Council CID at UNESCO, the International Certification of Dance Studies is awarded to students who have completed 150 hours of classes in a specific form of dance for Level 1. Another 150 hours are required for Level 2 and so on till Level 10. This is the only international certification for dance since the International Dance Council CID is the official body for all forms of dance; it is usually given in addition to local or national certificates, that is why it is colloquially called \"the dancer's passport\". Students cannot apply for this certification directly – they have to ask their school to apply on their behalf. This certification is awarded free of charge, there is no cost other than membership fees.\n\nInternational Dance Council CID at UNESCO administers the International Certification of Dance Studies.\n\n\nIn the United States, several electronics certifications are provided by the Electronics Technicians Association.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency's EMI offers credentials and training opportunities for United States citizens. Students do not have to be employed by FEMA or be federal employees for some of the programs.\n\nProfessional engineering is any act of planning, designing, composing, measuring, evaluating, inspecting, advising, reporting, directing or supervising, or managing any of the foregoing, that requires the application of engineering principles and that concerns the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public interest or the environment.\n\nEvent planning includes budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary permits, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, catering, coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. (Copied content from Event_Management; see that page's history for attribution.)\n\nCommon event planning certifications include:\n\nFacility management can be defined as an aspect of engineering management science that deals with the planning, designing, coordination of space and maintenance of a built environment to enhance quality service management system. Service Quality System includes activities like security, maintenance, catering, and external as well as internal cleaning. In general, it is also the coordination and harmonization of various specialist disciplines to create the best possible working environment for staff.\n\nFacility management is an interdisciplinary field devoted to the coordination of space, infrastructure, people and organization, often associated with the administration of office blocks, arenas, schools, convention centers, shopping complexes, hospitals, hotels, etc. However, FM facilitates on a wider range of activities than just business services and these are referred to as non-core functions.\n\n\nA warehouse management system (WMS) is a part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the status of bin utilization. A WMS monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. It involves the physical warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.\n\nMore precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. In the multi-echelon model for distribution, there may be multiple levels of warehouses. This includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by the central warehouse) and potentially retail warehouses (serviced by the regional warehouses).\n\n\n\nIECEx covers the highly specialized field of explosion protection associated with the use of equipment in areas where flammable gases, liquids and combustible dusts may be present. This system provides the assurance that equipment is manufactured to meet safety standards, and that services such as installation, repair and overhaul also comply with IEC International Standards on safety. The United Nations, via UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe), recommends the IEC and IECEx as the world’s best practice model for the verification of conformity to International Standards. It published a “Common Regulatory Framework” encompassing the use of IEC International Standards developed by IEC TC (Technical Committee) 31: Equipment for explosive atmospheres, with proof of compliance demonstrated by IECEx.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, insurance professionals are licensed separately by each state. Many individuals seek one or more certifications to distinguish themselves from their peers.\n\n\nTESOL is a large field of employment with widely varying degrees of regulation. Most provision worldwide is through the state school system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or secondary school teachers who are native speakers of the language of their pupils, and not of English. Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries in this capacity for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were anyone from backpackers hoping to earn some extra travel money to well-educated professionals in other fields doing volunteer work, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.\n\nOne of the problems facing these full-time teachers is the absence of an international governing body for the certification or licensure of English language teachers. However, Cambridge University and its subsidiary body UCLES are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their CELTA and DELTA programs. Trinity College London has equivalent programs, the CertTESOL and the LTCL DipTESOL. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in language awareness and classroom techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and in fact can be incorporated into a master's degree program.\n\nAn increasing number of attorneys are choosing to be recognized as having special expertise in certain fields of law. According to the American Bar Association, a lawyer who is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.\n\nLogistician is the profession in the logistics and transport sectors, including sea, air, land and rail modes. Professional qualification for logisticians usually carries post-nominal letters. \n\nCertification granting bodies include, but are not limited to, Association for Operations Management (APICS), Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), International Society of Logistics (SOLE), Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation (CITT), and Allied Council for Commerce and Logistics (ACCL).\n\n\nChurches have their own process of who may use various religious titles. Protestant churches typically require a Masters of Divinity, accreditation by the denomination and ordination by the local church in order for a minister to become a \"Reverend\". Those qualifications may or may not also give government authorization to solemnize marriages\n\nBoard certification is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The American Board of Medical Specialties, a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.\n\nMedical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific. Board certification demonstrates a physician’s exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of medical practice.\n\nPatients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician’s knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.\n\nOther professional certifications include certifications such as medical licenses, Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, nursing board certification, diplomas in social work. The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists that are knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the elderly. Additional certifying bodies relating to the medical field include:\n\n\nNCPRP stands for “National Certified Peer Recovery Professional”, and the NCPRP credential and exam were developed in collaboration with the International Certification Board of Recovery Professionals (ICBRP) and is currently being administered by PARfessionals.\n\nPARfessionals is a professional organization and all of the available courses are professional development and pre-certification courses.\n\nThe NCPRP credential and exam focus primarily on the concept of peer recovery through mental health and addiction recovery. It has the main purpose of training student-candidates on how to become peer recovery professionals who can provide guidance, knowledge or assistance for individuals who have had similar experiences.\n\nEach student-candidate must complete several key steps which include initial registration; the pre-certification review course; and all applicable sections of the official application in order to become eligible to complete the final step, which is the NCPRP certification exam.\n\nThe NCPRP credential is obtained once a participant successfully passes the NCPRP certification exam by the second attempt and is valid for five years.\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations which offer various certifications include:\n\nIn the USA, the Universal Accreditation Board, an organization composed of the Public Relations Society of America, the Agricultural Relations Council, the National School Public Relations Association, the Religious Communicators Council and other public relations professional societies, administers the Accreditation in Public Relations (APR), a voluntary certification program for public relations practitioners.\n\n\nOrganizations offering certification include:\n\n\nConferred by the National Speakers Association, the Certified Speaking Professional (CSP) is the speaking profession's international measure of professional platform competence. This certification is awarded by the National Speakers Association. Only about 10% of the speakers who belong to the Global Speakers Federation (GSF) hold this designation. Those who have earned their certification have done so by demonstrating a track record of experience and expertise.\n\n\nPolitical commentators have criticized professional or occupational licensing, especially medical and legal licensing, for restricting the supply of services and therefore making them more expensive, often putting them out of reach of the poor.\n\nThe proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained) has led some technologists to question their value. Proprietary content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise.\n\n"}

Redaction criticism regards the author of the text as editor (redactor) of the source materials. Unlike its parent discipline, form criticism, redaction criticism does not look at the various parts of a narrative to discover the original genre. Instead, it focuses on how the redactor shaped and moulded the narrative to express theological and ideological goals.\n\nThere are several ways in which redaction critics detect editorial activity like the following:\n\n\nAlthough redaction criticism (the possibility of the various gospels having different theological perspectives) has existed since Antiquity, three modern day scholars are regularly credited with this school's modern development: Gunther Bornkamm, Willi Marxsen and Hans Conzelmann (see Bornkamm, Barth and Held, \"Tradition and Interpretation in Matthew\", Marxsen, \"Mark the Evangelist\", Conzelmann, \"Theology of St Luke\").\n\nFrom the changes, redaction critics can sketch out the distinctive elements of an author/editor's theology. If a writer consistently avoids reporting, for example, the weaknesses of the Twelve Apostles, even when there are earlier sources that provide lurid details of their follies, one could draw the conclusion that the later editor/author held the Twelve in higher esteem because of the editor had presuppositions, or because the editor was perhaps trying to reinforce the legitimacy of those chosen by Jesus to carry on his work. By tracking the overall impact of this editorial activity, one can come away with a fairly strong picture of the purpose of a particular text.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An eliminativist might argue that this theory completely fails to describe anything real; the reductionist might argue that the concepts are valid, and that science will simply provide an increasingly detailed understanding of the demons. The revisionist would be somewhere in between, suggesting only that \"partial\" revision of the common sense understanding will be necessary. That is, parts of the demon theory will be validated by future research.\n\nToday, one is likely to be eliminativist about demons. However, eliminative materialists mention other psychological concepts (e.g. belief, will, consciousness) about which one is more likely to be revisionist.\n\nUnlike strong eliminative materialism, the revisionist often claims that a theory or concept is only \"partially\" incorrect, perhaps because it ignores a few important causal factors.\n"}
{"id": "39426637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39426637", "title": "Romantic epistemology", "text": "Romantic epistemology\n\nRomantic epistemology emerged from the Romantic challenge to both the static, materialist views of the Enlightenment (Hobbes) and the contrary idealist stream (Hume) when it came to studying life. Romanticism needed to develop a new theory of knowledge that went beyond the method of inertial science, derived from the study of inert nature (\"natura naturata\"), to encompass vital nature (\"natura naturans\"). Samuel Taylor Coleridge was at the core of the development of the new approach, both in terms of art and the 'science of knowledge' itself (epistemology). Coleridge's ideas regarding the philosophy of science involved Romantic science in general, but Romantic medicine in particular, as it was essentially a philosophy of the science(s) of life.\n\nEuropean thought had come through the scientific revolution concerning heaven (astronomy) and earth (physics), and emerged, full of optimism about man's power of cognition, into the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. In facing the mystery of life itself, researchers first sought to apply the method that had worked so effectively for inertial nature to the realm of vital nature. In this approach Man himself was seen as a static entity and a tabula rasa, onto which was written sense-experience, considered as the source of all knowledge. Thus, life and knowledge were increasingly regarded from a mechanical and materialistic perspective. As William Godwin stated succinctly about the age, \"the human mind… is nothing but a faculty of perception,\" that all knowledge \"comes from impression,\" and the mind starts with \"absolute ignorance.\" (Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, 1793)\n\nHowever, this approach faced a problem: the experience of a split between subject (man as experiencing) and object (the thing being experienced), the inner world of the mind and the outer world of things. This very real experience created a growing unease and doubt in Western philosophy regarding the reliability of sense-experience as the basis for knowledge: did what was perceived bear any true relationship to what was or was perception simply at best a representation of reality and at worst an illusion. The epistemological dilemma arising from man's existential reality eventuated in two positions - materialism and idealism. The materialism of Hobbes elevated matter, and the sense-experience of matter, to the level of sole reality, life being but an epiphenomenon. The contrary position of Hume was that the only reality man could be certain of was his inner experience of thought so that reality was not object-ive (things outside of us), but a creation of the mind. The materialist position was combatted initially by the works of the Cambridge Platonists, notably More and Cudworth, who set out to show how Nature, Man and the Divine were connected through a 'plastic power' that was accessible to the mind if it were approached rightly.\n\nThe idealist position was challenged by the Common Sense Philosophy of Thomas Reid. The German philosopher, Immaunuel Kant, whose ancestors came from the same part of Scotland as Reid, set out to rescue scientific knowledge from the idealism of Hume. While his critical analysis set the foundation for a more rigorous philosophy and science, his solution to idealism was to accept Hume's limits to human knowledge as well as the idea of a transcendent reality, but then to assert the legitimacy of natural science in delineating the reality of sense-experience, and to operate 'as if' what one perceived was indeed reality, an approach that served to 'save the appearances'.\n\nRomanticism was inspired by Kant's critical approach to the problem of knowledge, but rejected his limits to that knowledge, seeing it as confining the science of vital nature to the materialist approach, making life an epiphenomenon of \"the chance whirlings of unproductive particles\" as Coleridge put it succinctly. There was a profound feeling that a new epistemology, or 'science of knowledge' was needed to deal with the question of vital nature and the nature of life itself. Art, and in particular poetry, provided a vehicle to explore vital nature and to get to its essence, but for it to be scientific required an epistemological foundation. The central figure in the development of this epistemology was Samuel Taylor Coleridge (along with J.W. von Goethe in Germany); this was recognized in his time, after his time and even most recently.\n\nColeridge was strongly influenced in his initial study of philosophy by Kant, but also from the re-introduction of Platonic thought via the Cambridge Platonists, particularly the discovery of Cudworth's history of thought [Hill, Introduction], and the ideas of Plotinus and neo-Platonism, not to mention the common sense philosophy of Thomas Reid. The view of the mind as passive was challenged, as it seemed to leave no room for creativity and individuality. His own experience of creative powers of the mind, as experienced in and through poetry in particular, led him to seek out the role of imagination in human thought, and necessarily to distinguish it from fancy.\n\nThe meeting with Wordsworth in 1795 marked a turning point in Coleridge’s thinking about thinking. In Wordsworth, Coleridge found a congenial mind, one that helped to foster the \"innate platonising quality\" of his mind. This collaboration led to an enhancement of his own poetic creativity and the growth of his critical faculty.\n\nColeridge went to Germany with Wordsworth in 1798-99, learned German and became more acquainted with German philosophy, both the Kantian stream and German Idealism (Fichte, Schelling). Coleridge came to realize that the mind was not an associative faculty governed by blind, mechanical laws, as Hartley's doctrine of mechanical association presented it, but rather was essentially a product of a creative shaping power (imagination) that ruled perception and governed our mentation but could also in its higher form be used to create new \"things\", resulting in the evolution of consciousness and mind itself. Coleridge distinguished between imagination and fancy, which only fabricated illusions. For Coleridge, the creative capacity of the imagination, the \"prime agent of all human perception,\" was the key to connecting to the essence of things outside of ourselves and overcoming the apparent split between self and object occasioned by man's self-consciousness. The driving force of that connection and the activation of the creative imagination to get at the inherent essence of external objects was love, a deep desire to know other than ourselves. As Dorothy Emmet (1952) noted, the entire basis of Coleridge's new approach to knowing nature was that \"we should be able not only to look, but to love as we look\" making philosophy and science a romantic endeavour.\n\nFor Coleridge, Western philosophy was intellect-bound and driven, containing no power of creative imagination, such as could be discerned in the Greek term \"nous\" (\"noetic capacity\"), as expressed most maturely in neo-Platonic philosophy (Plotinus). Philosophy, for Coleridge, was \"scientia scientiarum\" (the science of science), and critical to any advance in knowledge was its ability to go beyond a mere compilation of facts to the use of the creative imagination to create a true epistemology, or the 'true and original realism.'\n\nThis capacity for seeing in a new light required a new capacity, and just as 'all the organs of sense are framed for a corresponding world of sense' so 'all the organs of spirit are framed for a correspondent world of spirit' so that the first principle of a true philosophy is 'to render the mind intuitive of the spiritual in man' that is, that which lies on the other side of our natural awareness from sense-experience. And it is the sense-world that derives from a higher super-sensible world, not the converse as materialism would have it. \"I teach a real existence of a spiritual world without a material, but no matter without Spirit.' This world beyond the confines of space and time involved an 'ethereal element' by means of which individual entities, at base non-material, could communicate via 'the tremulous reciprocations of which propagate themselves to the inmost of the soul'. And these tremulations operate on and between entities via one's deep desire (love-resonance) that creates a circuit between subject and object, such that one has access via an inner organ (Coleridge's \"inmost mind\" or Goethe's \"Gemüt\") and the corresponding 'philosophic' or re-emergent Greek noetic organ. All knowledge for Coleridge rests on the \"coadunation\" of subject and object, of the representation in the mind (thought) of a sense experience with the object itself, which can only occur where there is a connection between subject and object ('a reciprocal concurrence of both') beyond pure sense-experience, such that the thought that arises out of 'the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking' produces not a representation but a phenomenon (in the Heideggerian sense) that is the re-enactment in the mind of reality (such as for Collingwood in his \"Idea of History\") and as such is knowledge that is apodictic, heuristic and hermeneutic all at the same time.\n\nColeridge based his epistemology on two facts of experience: that of self (I AM) and that of a world co-connected with self. Our being is something we can know intuitively and certainly, but the existence of things outside is less certain and subject to doubt, unless one acknowledges that a world outside is 'not only coherent but identical, and one and the same thing with our own immediate self-consciousness', that is, that the experience of things without is a function of our experience of self. If we use only the intellect, we separate things that are not in reality separated, and this then gives only a knowledge of the outer appearances (Baon's \"natura naturata)\", termed in German, \"Wissen\", known as natural science (\"Natur-Wissenschaft\"). Upon irradiation from the noetic (from Greek \"nous\") ideational capacity, however, this natural science of inert nature then becomes a useful means to render rational and analytical (therefore public knowledge or science) what is otherwise experienced only internally as a private ('subjective') knowledge.\n\nThe presupposition of material science of an objective world 'out there' separate from us that causes sense-experience and is then responsible for our thoughts and feelings is replaced for Coleridge by 'the truest and most binding realism' that is grounded in a \"coeducation\" between subject and object, mediated by the creative imagination, a very real power of mind that reunites in 'the human mind above nature', what is always united, but only separate by a 'prejudice of our mind' due to our self-consciousness arising out of the self-awareness created by the mental capacity (Latin mens). Coleridge’s “true and original realism” accepts that the object perceived is itself real and not an illusion of the mind, as Hume and Kant would have it, but also that 'an object is inconceivable without a subject as its antithesis. \"Omen perceptum percipientum supponit\" [Everything perceived supposes a perceiver].' At the same time, the underlying principle of this realism can be neither subject or object, but that which unites the two, and this is a self-consciousness presence of mind ('self-consciousness is not a kind of being, but a kind of knowing' - \"Biographia Literaria\")\n\nSense-experience for Coleridge does not cause mind but is a means of revealing and evolving mind. As a result, being and thinking are not related as cause to effect, but as co-determinant. “... the principium essendi does not stand to the principlum cognoscende in the relation of cause to effect, but both the one and the other are co-inherent and identical.” (\"Biographia Literaria\") Self-conscious, being a self-contained principle, can then be made into a pure thought, containing a polarity, \"with two opposite and counteracting forces,\" which is the minimum needed for motion (“life”), that then leads to self-discovery and \"the fullness of the human intelligence.\" (\"Biographia Literaria\")\n\nThe means by which philosophy, or the general principles for seeking knowledge, is rendered into actual knowledge or science is “method.” Method involves the considered, thoughtful arrangement of parts that reflects the inner essence of things (association by continuity), and not simply their apparent association in space and time (association by contiguity). This involves a \"preconception\" a \"leading Thought\" - Bacon's 'forethoughtful inquiry' or 'dry light' (lumens siccum) - and a\"progressive transition\" not \"a mere dead arrangement.\"\n\nColeridge uses the example of electricity which had been known as an empirical fact for centuries, but it was not until science took on the organizing Idea of polarity (out of the genius of mind that derived this from the “given” of the world order), that rapid progress was made in revealing the nature and governing laws of this fact of nature. This is in contrast to magnetism, also known for centuries, but still 'unknown' scientifically in his day as being still without an organizing Idea.\n\nThe fact of a relationship of parts to wholes derives from man’s inherent experience of himself as apart from nature and yet somehow connected with it, “the instinct, in which humanity itself is grounded: that by which, in every act of conscious perception, we at once identify our being with that of the world without us, and yet place ourselves in contradistinction to that world.”\n\nBoth determine the relation of the parts to the whole, and create the governing 'truth originating in the [noetic] mind, and not abstracted or generalized from observation of the parts.\" There is divine or spiritual LAW and Natural Law, and between these two lies the laws governing human culture or the arts, for every work of the genius of man contains 'a necessary predominance of the Ideas (i.e. of that which originates in the artist himself), and a comparative indifference of the materials'.\n\nThe goal of philosophy is to make systematic and conscious that which otherwise happens naturally, but unconsciously, namely access to the higher realm of Idea and Law (what Coleridge termed revelation), so as to then unfold through reason the various principles of application.\n\nThe development and progression of mind and consciousness from and to this realm of what the Greeks termed wisdom (philosophy being the systematic means of bringing wisdom from the Superconscious Mind (\"The vision and the faculty divine\") and individual sub-consciousness into the conscious mind) is what Coleridge terms “Method.”\n\nFrom this Coleridge is led to conclude that there is a functional polarity: the productive power (\"dynamis\"), \"which acts in nature as nature, is essentially one…with…the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature.\" (BL) Given this “self-organising” power in nature, form then follows function, or form is developed not from without, but from within. While developing and once developed, it can be influenced from without (stimuli), but its formative forces lie within and work outward. The correlative of this is “that as the forms in all organized existence, so must all true and living knowledge proceed from within.” Knowledge is a proper exercise of mind, not the blind, mechanical collation of data along some presumed criteria for ordering. As Coleridge wrote of Bacon, who he saw as misunderstood and misinterpreted, \"the truths which have their signatures in nature, and which (as he himself plainly and often asserts) may indeed be revealed to us through and with, but never by the senses, or the faculty of sense.\"\n\nThus, the role of mind becomes paramount. Where in Nature there are laws to keep everything in harmonious, dynamic whole, powered by a blind force (living principle), there must also be a similar force, but rational in essence, that works on and in man, what the Greeks termed the Logos, and its executive organ, the \"nous\".\n\nColeridge sees two directions for the mind - outward and inward - reflecting the two givens of man’s existence - the world “out there,” experienced through the physical senses and the world “in here,” experienced through man’s thinking capacity. The \"Sense\" (German \"Sinn\") polarically contrasted with \"the inmost Mind\" (Goethe's \"Gemüt\") - \"A science which derives its name and character from the Logos.. as distinguished from ... the Sense and from the Nous.\" (\"Treatise on Logic\" II, 38 and 39) and in his \"Essays on Method\", Essay XI, \"[There are] two forms of method, inseparably co-existent.\"\n\nThere is a method for discovering both: the sensbile world of nature out there (though also within us), via a simple desire to explore; and the super-sensible world of man’s thought activity within. In essence, as Coleridge says: “The potential works in us [virtually] even as the actual works on us.”\n\nColeridge challenged two basic assumptions of inertial science: the absolute dichotomy between mind and matter (or subjective and objective), or the severed “outness” of nature; and the assumption as fact, that physical nature has acted always and at all times the same (“uniformitarianism”) – that is the assumption of a fixed “outness” of perceived objects (natura naturata).\n\nThe first follows from the second as uniformitarianism presupposes the fixed “outness” of appearances. However, as Coleridge understood, “outness” is not tenable philosophically or historically.\nFor Coleridge, scientific method cannot be based on the absolute “outness” of things, but must involve accepting that an ‘object as experienced’ is, in plain terms, the object itself; and that there is no other, and somehow still more objective, object lurking coyly behind it (as Kant would have it).\n\nMan, being his own ground and starting point, (the scriptural I AM in that I AM or YHWH) is then confronted with the mystery of life. There is an apparent chain of being from the lowliest form of biological life to the highest. The highest is man himself, the one with the unique capability for self-awareness and self-reflection, thinking about things and even thinking about thinking, the highest form. It is also obvious that there are different kinds as well as degrees, seen in the distinction between minerals and animals, and between these two kingdoms and the plant kingdom. In the latter distinction, there also generally is seen the presence or absence of life. Matter, in the mineral form, is not dead, but what Saumarez termed \"common matter,\" whereas plants and animals involve \"living matter.\" This is what Coleridge terms “life biological” as for him, there is life in all of creation, life consisting of a dynamic polarity of forces, that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestation: \"Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process..\". (\"Biographia Literaria\")\n\nThis dynamic polarity produces motion, acts throughout all of creation, and via the power of the creative imagination, leads to the evolution of mind and consciousness. And the direction of this motion of the universe is towards increasing individuation, though there is also equal and opposite tendency of connection, the interaction of which leads to higher and higher individuation, \"the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object.\"(\"Biographia Literaria\")\n\nThis productive or generative power of life (Blumenbach's \"Bildungstrieb\"- Coleridge sat in on his lectures during his visit to Germany) exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but its \"productive energy is not extinguished in this product, but overflows, or is effluent…as the function of the body.\" (BL). Thus, the very nature of the “given” (IT IS) is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts.\n\nLife, that is, the essential polarity in unity ('multeity in unity') in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting or 'gathering' state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form, a new creation or emergent, of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.\n\nMatter, for Coleridge is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power but a resultant. It is also forms the mass of a given body. The entire process of nature is this progressive unfolding of principle into matter, and then the increasing tendency to move inward that which was previously external, that is, to individuate forms.\n\nWith Coleridge, there is also a four-fold or bi-polarity of powers, forces and energies represented by the cross. Each power has itself two poles. In ancient philosophy this bi-polarity was represented by the four element theory - air, water, fire and earth and more modernly by the four-fold composition of matter - carbon (earth), hydrogen (fire), oxygen (water) and nitrogen (air).\n\nThis progressive unfolding of the initial dynamic principle into the dimensions of space and time leads to a trinity of 'life biological'.\n\nColeridge also sees that the instincts - hunger, thirst, mating - motivate growth and evolve into higher powers, the most important being that of desire which 'has something of the quality of the concept of imagination\".\n\nAs Bostetter states: “The fact that he derives all the passions from the third vital power [Desire]–fundamentally a sexual power–shows how much aware he is of its importance.” And in linking it also to the mind elsewhere, shows how thought itself is a “sexual” function (Eureka!). With the study of the passions, the intermediate stage between life and the emergence of mind, Coleridge had in mind a system in which mind was both the passive goal and active agent in “life universal.” For Bostetter, his was a transcendentalism “in which a universal mind or life force created, flowed through, and, by process of evolution, shaped the physical universe.”\n\nThe Mind is bipolar in that intellect and reason comprise the 'sense' and \"nous poeticos\" and \"nous patheticos\", the dual aspects of the \"nous\" itself, \"the inmost nature\" of mind.\n\nFor Coleridge, the mind was an action, a power not a thing, ('the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking') and in this power there are two powers, active and passive, with the imagination functioning in-between.\n\nColeridge goes on to deal with this power of imagination that emerged from the third power of the passions - desideration. The emotions, if contemplated and “recollected in tranquility” produce objective, as opposed to subjective, feeling that can then be expressed aesthetically via symbols (Suzanne Langer). The 'poetic' imagination is essentially projective, producing projective art works, whilst the philosophic imagination of Coleridge is evocative and is used to draw out the meaning and essence of the symbols already extant in our surroundings. And these objective feelings, being linked to reality and the over-riding super-sensible determinant of that reality, act powerfully within the forms of nature and culture. As was expressed in the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads, \"the power of the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature as might almost appear miraculous…\" (This would point to the founder of the American New Thought movement, Phineas Parkhurst Quimby)\n\nIn a famous passage from his \"Biographia Literaria\", Coleridge distinguishes between the primary imagination, which is the underlying agent of human perception, and the secondary imagination, which operates more in the conscious mind, and this is further polarized between its highest effort - new re-creation (unity through re-creation) - and its fallback - a struggle to unify through idealization.\n\nFor Coleridge, poetry is idealistic and man needs to go beyond the projective forms of art, the belletristic arts, to another art form, this time where man as subject, draws out of nature, including human nature, the potential that is there in what we actually experience. For Romantic medicine, in particular, Andreas Röschlaub and Samuel Hahnemann, the art of remediation, to achieve a true health for the individual, was an evocative art, \"Heilkunde\" and \"Heilkunst\", that sought, as in the ancient Greek idea of education, to educe, to elicit or draw out of the suffering individual what was potential (state of health) into actuality.\n\nImagination is active and acts while “hovering between images,” and when it fixes on a given image, it then becomes understanding. Communication of these images of the understanding is what Coleridge terms 'noetic ideation'. “Communication by the symbolic use of the Understanding is the function of Queen Imagination on behalf of Noetic Ideation.” In contrast, fancy is static and idealising, creating nothing real, but it does, as Colerdige notes, provide a “drapery” for the body of thought.\n\nThe power of imagination is evident in the relationship of reality between parts and whole, and the ability thereby to associate parts of the same whole (phenomenon) (association by contiguity) that are not ordinarily so associated in time and space (association by continuity), \"the perception of similitude in dissimilitude\" which \"principle is the great spring of the activity of our minds, and their chief feeder.\" (Wordsworth's Preface to the Lyrical Ballads) Indeed, it is in the ability to see what is similar in what appears dissimilar, and what is dissimilar in what presents as similar (continuity) that resides the creative genius of a man.\n\nArt is an artificial arrangement, that is to say, not that of crude nature, but nature re-arranged is “re-presented” to the mind of man so that there is a condensed unity of parts in a given representation (compare Literature with History). It is not an illusion, but a re-creation of nature’s innate unity, unconscious and promiscuous, into a new unity.\n\nIn re-presenting nature, the “poet” is not simply copying or distorting nature. But in order to do so, he \"must master the essence, the \"natura naturans\", which presupposes a bond between nature in the higher sense and the soul of man\" or human nature. The wisdom of nature, the primal wisdom, is in man in the form of the body; it is participative, unconscious and instantaneous (instinctual). The wisdom of man has to be produced, re-created and given a conscious value or appraisal. It needs to be made coadunative, compresent by an act of will through objective feeling and noetic ideation. In this regard, the body wisdom (Walter Cannon) is striving to become conscious wisdom \"in the human mind above nature.\"\n\nThe intellect is \"the faculty of suiting measures to circumstances,\" or \"the faculty judging according to sense.\" Intellect is linked initially to fancy, such that their functioning forms a law by which man \"is impelled to abstract the changes and outward relations of matter and to arrange them under the form of causes and effects.\" This law is necessary for man's awareness and freedom, but if not conjoined with a new participative capacity (the Goethean \"Gemüt\") would \"prevent or greatly endanger man's development and progression.\" The intellect in man, as contrasted with animals, is the ability not only to obey rules, but to create them and to know what the term \"rule\" means. It is the possibility of sense experience. Sensation is \"already intelligence in process of constructing itself.\" Thus, \"intelligence is a self-development and sensation itself is but vision nascent, not the cause of intelligence, but intelligence itself revealed as an earlier power in the process of self-construction\" working on the sense-data to provide names of objects and the relationships of their outer forms in terms of cause and effect (what Suzanne Langer terms 'figuration').\n\nThe intellect also is to be distinguished from reason. The intellect, unirradiated by reason, is a faculty of the instinct, which man shares with the higher animals (cunning). It is subject to the physical laws of heredity, and the evolution from sense to passive understanding is an identical one in man and animal. In man, there is in addition its polar opposite, namely \"active\" intellect, which, in the form of conscious intent, is there in man all along as potential in contrast to the animal and forms the basis for criminal law (mens rea). The intellect is reactive as regards the sense pole and proactive as regards the pole of reason (the conceptual faculty).\n\nReason essentially deals with principles and the intellect with concepts, both factual (physical) and functional (etheric). The noetic faculty deals with Ideas, which then are elaborated into principles by reason, whilst the intellect establishes concepts arranged using scalar logic (for ordination of facts) and polar logic (for functions). This provides a trinity of mind, wherein the intermediate faculty of imagination is the matrix connecting all of them.\n\nReason is present in the whole process of nature, yet is accessible only to the intellect. It is responsible for the awakening process in human consciousness from unconsciousness, through sleeping and dreaming to waking. Coleridge understood an ascent of consciousness from sense perception, wherein reason lies as potential only (Sleeping Beauty) to the apprehension of reason itself.\n\nFor Coleridge, intellect is \"the faculty of rules\" and reason \"the source of principles.\" Intellect is the world of man, and human law, where the end can and often does justify the means. It is not the world of reason. It is the fact of reason's presence in nature that allows us to speak of it becoming apparent or \"present to\" the intellect, such that we have an ulterior consciousness that is behind the natural awareness (the \"unconscious\") of all animals, one that is self-reflective or \"philosophic\" though there is a purely 'mental' philosophy that Coleridge termed 'psilosophy' and that which involves also the noetic capacity of mind (the \"nous\" rather than just the \"mens\") which is true philosophy in the Greek sense of 'love of wisdom' — \"philia\" \"love\", \"sophia\" \"wisdom.\"\n\nAnd this creates a functional identity between the philosophic imagination and instinct, as those who have the first, \"...feel in their own spirits the same instinct, which impels the chrysallis of the horned fly to leave room in its involucrum for antennae yet to come. They know and feel that the potential works in them, even as the actual works on them.\"\n\nWhat renders the intellect human (that is, active) is precisely the ability to identify by naming (nominalism), that is, to abstract or generalize, for it is from this ability that we get the human ability of speech. And it is in speech or language that we first see this irradiation of the intellect by reason. Animals may generalize, but they do not name, they do not have the power of abductive inference. Reason makes its mark in the form of the grammar of a language. Thus, the higher understanding is concerned not only with names, but then only with names (denominating) as describing appearances, not content.\n\nReason exists in language in the form of grammar (principles of language), though not in idioms which transcend the rational structure).\n\nIt is the power to abstract from experience that makes us human, but this power must become a means to an end, not an end in itself, as in material science. That end is imagination and reason, and then, for Coleridge, on to the 'organ' of noetic ideation, the Greek \"nous\"..\n\nIn instinct we are united with nature, in intellection we are detached from nature, and in imagination re-united with nature. If we make passive understanding (intellection)- the power of abstraction - an end in itself, we become according to Coleridge \"a race of animals, in whom the presence of reason is manifested solely by the absence of instinct.\" This means that we become slaves to the idols of our own making (the appearances of things) \"falling prostrate before lifeless images, the creatures of his own abstraction, [man] is himself sensualized, and becomes a slave to the things of which he was formed to be the conqueror and sovereign.\"\n\nWithout reason, we are but animals and commit existential suicide, submitting, as earlier Sophists, \"all positions alike, however heterogeneous, to the criterion of the mere [intellect].\" By shutting out reason we end up in a world of opinions, authority-based law, instruction, material science, and the death of spirit and soul. Enlightenment becomes the tyranny of the intellect and good intentions end up on the guillotine of the intellect. Abstraction turned back on itself, becomes dependent on the senses and the outer appearances, or the despotism of the eye and \"leads to a science of delusion\" as Coleridge stated. The so-called Enlightenment was more the \"deliberate shuttering of the [intellect] from the light of reason.\"\n\nWithout reason, the intellect becomes active under the impulsion of fancy, such that \"the omission to notice what not is being noticed will be supposed not to exist\" or \"to limit the conceivable within the bounds of the perceivable\", which is the tyranny or despotism of the physical eye.\n\nReason irradiates the human psyche at all levels as it is, for Coleridge, in seed form even at the lowest level of consciousness. It is the original impetus for self-projection or individuation as Coleridge put it. Reason is a unity not itself divisible, as it can only be used in the singular, unlike intellect and intellects.\n\nThe intellect operating at the sense pole provides the power that leads to abstraction and man's separation from nature, but also awareness of self as separate from nature and God. However, detachment can lead to existential despair without the 'light of reason' to provide a new attachment or relationship to nature and God, one based on individual sovereignty. With reason, the nisus is from sense to consciousness and finally to self-consciousness, that is, individuation. Until reason is consciously apprehended, we remain in a plant or animal-like state of consciousness, but when apprehended, we are \"awake\" (reborn in spirit). The last stage requires the active understanding, which is the intellect fully irradiated by reason, itself irradiated by Nous.\n\nThis then allows for “speculation,” which is the Baconian realisation of the natural idea out of \"natura naturata\", or the outer appearances of things, guided by the forethoughtful inquiry (\"lumens siccum\") coming from what Coleridge termed the more inmost part of the mind, the noetic capacity or \"nous\". Without such irradiation from both the \"nous\" and reason, we end up with “lawless flights of speculation” (Coleridge). Lawful speculation, however, could then be processed by the new Greek or Goethean participative (coadunative, compresent) capacity (\"Gemüt\"), and worked up into a phenomenological presentation.\n\nReason without the focus on sense experience is “pure reason” (Rudolf Steiner’s “pure thinking” or pure \"sinnen\") and in that condition, reason is able to make contact with and be irradiated itself by wisdom. Copernican reason (Aristarchus) allowed us to comprehend the universal verus the Ptolemaic intellect which kept us 'earthbound' in terms of our point of reference. Our individuation culminates in what Coleridge terms \"the fullness of intelligence.\"\n\nThe light of reason is thus both the origin and the abiding basis of individuality. Without the positive presence of reason to the understanding [intellect], there is no individuality, only the detachment which individual being presupposes. Reason, in both its negative and its positive aspect, is the individualiser. Reason itself unirradiated (by the Nous) leads to the dominance of the collective (Hegel's State) over the individual.\n\nReason operating consciously in us through the imagination is the act of self-consciousness, the “I AM.” Reason, via the intellect also enables initially the mind's detachment from nature, creating 'subject' and 'object.' It provides for the power to behold polarities and indeed shows itself \"out of the moulds of the understanding only in the disguise of two contradictory conceptions.\" To avoid being propelled into existential nihilsm, we then need to use the active side of reason ('productive unity'), such that reason is \"the tendency at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment.\"\n\nTo go from the indirect moonlight of mere intellect (mirrored through sense experience) to the direct sunlight of active understanding (irradiated by reason) is to go from exterior perception (of appearances) to a universal ulterior appercetion of phenomena (phenomenology); \"it is to pass on from fancy's business of arranging and re-arranging the 'products of destruction, the cadavera rerum,' to imagination's business with 'the existence of absolute life,' or Being, which is the 'correlative of truth.'\" (\"Biographia Literaria\") It is also to go from the delusion that diversity is division or that a concept held by two minds is two concepts, rather than two exemplars of one concept.\n\nThe power that allows reason to act on the intellect so as to raise it and make it active, as understanding, is the creative or secondary imagination.\n\nAnd the apparent contradictions revealed initially by passive reason, are really the dynamic functions of life, and this can only be perceived by the active power of reason, which involves the imagination.\n\nAnd reason is also part of the Logos for Coleridge (\"the Word or Logos is life, and communicates life\" and it is also \"light, and communicates light,\" the light of positive reason, or Nous). The negative form of reason, which is the capability God gave man to comprehend the divine light, is light in its potential form, though the darkness of the mere intellect may fail to comprehend it.\n\n\"Words are living powers, not merely articulated air.\" Language is to consciousness what geometry is to space and mathematics to time. It is language, not sense experience, that orients mind to reality.\n\nFor Coleridge, language in its highest form, is the very tool and vehicle for understanding reality and the basis for the evolution of mind and consciousness. He takes as the foundation our immediate living experience of things (Thomas Reid's Common Sense) as well as of our very self - the mind as dynamic act. Words, for Coleridge, reveal the creative mind, working via the power of imagination (versus the power of fancy) to reveal reality (not to create artifacts of experience). However, there is a difference between the popular, descriptive use of language, which \"as objects are essentially fixed and dead,\" and the more serious discursive, scholarly use of language. Beyond that there is the 'best part of language', the language of disclosure, which discloses by the very use of precise, desynonimized terms.\n\nThis 'disclosive' language emerges as a result of the cultivation of profound (objective) feeling (Suzanne Langer), and deep thought (involving the inmost mind (nous), in both its nether (the \"nous patheticos\", or Goethe's Gemüt) and upper aspects (nous poieticos or Rudolf Steiner's Geist). Here, the full mind, both mental and noetic, not just the intellect and reason, is active in establishing the meaning of words. Disclosive language taps into and contains the 'fullness of intelligence', expressing living experience (\"Erlebniss\" in German). This disclosive language is also one that evolves along with man's consciousness and the progress of science, in that terms come more and more to be desynonymized, such as the famous distinction Coleridge made between imagination and fancy and awareness and consciousness. Coleridge's view was in contrast to the predominant Lockean tradition: for Locke, static concepts and their verbal exponents arise from experience, whereas for Coleridge the proper use of language is a dynamic or romantic event between mind and nature.\n\nThus, for Coleridge, language, that is, the different true forms of the one Logos, discloses to us the very content and activity of cognition, and that since 'mind is an act', language is the means for the evolution of mind and consciousness (Logos, the evolver). Initially, Coleridge focussed on poetry as the source of living experience in words, but later came to understand that poetry was 'essentially ideal\" and that the poetic imagination 'struggles to idealize' and to \"spread (project) a tone around forms, incidents and situations.\" One had to go beyond poetry and the poetic imagination, into the 'verbal imagination' to get at the true power of language to use \"words that convey feelings and flash images\" to disclose reality via the common ethereal element of our being.\n\nThis involves a participative capacity of mind to create a dynamic between mind and word, so that the minds of the reader or listener and the writer or speaker create a co-adunation or compresence (Samuel Alexander). This capacity involves not just the abstracting Latin intellect (mens), but the re-emergent participative Greek \"nous\". Coleridge referred to this new capacity of mind, using the \"nous\" to irradiate the Latin \"mens\", as an 'ulterior consciousness'. And this capacity of mind to participate mind is an 'ethereal medium.\" Mind is at the very foundation of being of man and much more than the sum of sense experience, and the purpose of his method is \"to render the mind intuitive of the spiritual [non-sensible] in man\" and develop \"this ulterior consciousness\". The medium of the compresence of minds (\"spiritual intercourse\") is \"the common ethereal element of their being, the tremulous reciprocations [tremulations] of which propagate themselves even to the inmost of the soul.\" (BL)\n\nLanguage is both an expression and motive force for the evolution of consciousness; the history of words is a history of mind (see Owen Barfield's History in English Words). For Coleridge, creation is \"the language of God\" (Logos), and this can be read in the realms of nature, culture and spirit.\n\nAt the core of the idea of romanticism is romantic cognosis, or 'co-gnosis', the dynamic interplay of masculine and feminine forces and energies in the mind and imagination, involving a dyadic unit of consciousness right from the beginning (Genesis: 'male and female made he them'). Coleridge speaks of \"the feminine mind and imagination,\" and provides the polaric example of the two giants of English literature, Shakespeare (\"darts himself forth and passes into all the forms of human character and passion\") and Milton (\"attracts all forms and things to himself\" which \"shape themselves anew\" in him). For Coleridge, \"imagination is both active and passive\", that is, masculine and feminine in nature. He also provides a similar polarity between the essentially passive primary imagination, that (spontaneously, reactively) configures sensory experience (\"a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM\"), and the active secondary imagination that 'dissolves, diffuses and dissipates in order to re-create' via the higher state of mind and consciousness. Coleridge also distinguished between the poetic imagination, which is essentially projective, and the philosophic imagination, which is essentially pro-active (\"the scared power of self-intuition, [which] can interpret and understand the symbols\" inherent in the world around us).\n\nFor Coleridge, the life which is in each of us is in other people and things out there as well, allowing for communication between Mother nature and human nature, as well as between individuals. At the level of mind, ideas are 'mysterious powers, living, seminal, formative' and \"essentially one with the germinal causes in nature. Goethe's identification and elaboration of the \"Gemüt\" as the organ of mind for participatiing the living essence or \"Wesen\" of nature, whether in Mother or human nature, is what Coleridge termed our 'inmost mind'.\n\nIn addition to the dynamic polarity between masculine and feminine principles of mind and consciousness, Coleridge identified \"the pleasure principle\" as the \"chief principle\" and \"great spring of activity of our minds\", from which \"the sexual appetence and all the passions connected with it take their origin.\n\n"}

{"id": "4348501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4348501", "title": "The Alchemy of Happiness", "text": "The Alchemy of Happiness\n\nKimiya-yi Sa'ādat ( ) was a book written by Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī, a Persian theologian, philosopher, and prolific Sunni Muslim author regarded as one of the greatest systematic thinkers of Islam. The Kimiya-yi Sa'ādat was written towards the end of his life shortly before 499/1105. During the time before it was written the Muslim world was considered to be in a state of political as well as intellectual unrest. Al-Ghazālī, noted that there were constant disputes about the role of philosophy and scholastic theology, and that Sufis became chastised for their neglect of the ritual obligations of Islam. Upon its release, the Kimiya-yi sa'ādat allowed al-Ghazali to considerably cut the tensions between the scholars and mystics. Kimiya-yi sa'ādat emphasized importance of observing the ritual requirements of Islam, the actions that would lead to salvation, and avoidance of sin. The factor that set the Kimiya-yi sa'ādat apart from other theological works at the time was its mystical emphasis on self-discipline and asceticism.\n\nThe Kimiya-yi Sa'ādat and its subsequent translations begin with citing some councils of the Prophet. Overall, the Kimiya-yi sa'ādat has four principle parts of ten chapters each:\n\nSa'āda (happiness) is a central concept in Islamic philosophy used to describe the highest aim of human striving. Sa'āda is considered to be part of the \"ultimate happiness\", namely that of the hereafter. Only when a human being has liberated his/her soul completely from its corporal existence, and arrives at what is called \"active intellect\". Al-Ghazali believed in practical-ethical perfection and that by exercising his God-given capacity for reason man must be drawn to the spiritual alchemy that transforms the soul from worldliness to complete devotion to God. This alone, he believed could produce ultimate happiness. Ghazālī's teachings were to help man to live a life in accordance with the sacred law, and by doing so gain a deeper understanding of its meaning on the day of Judgement.\n\nKimiya or Kimiā (Alchemy) is an applied and mystical science that has been studied for centuries. In its essence, Kimiā represents a complete conception of the universe and relations between earthly beings and the cosmos. Religious philosophers emphasized its importance as a religious discipline. Due to its spiritual dimensions Kimiā is considered the noblest of all occult sciences (i.e. astrology and various kinds of magic). Ghazali was himself a believer that everything on Earth is a manifestation of God’s spirit, thus everything belongs to kimiā.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the Kimiya-yi sa'ādat is a rewrite of the Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen. Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen was written by al-Ghazali after abandoning his duties as a professor due to a \"spiritual crisis\", which led him to live in seclusion for several years. It was composed in Arabic, and was an attempt to show ways in which the lives of a Sufi could be based on what is demanded by Islamic law. There are definite parallels between Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen and Kimiya-yi sa'ādat, however the four introductory chapters of the Kimiya-yi sa'ādat contain relevant theological discussions that set the two apart. The Kimiya-yi sa'ādat is noticeably shorter than the Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen, however in the original Persian introduction of the Kimiya-yi sa'ādat, Ghazālī explicitly states he wrote Kimiya-yi sa'ādat to mirror the essence of Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen and a few of his other theological writings; he wrote it in Persian so that it could reach a broader, popular audience in his homeland.\n\nFrom its original Persian form the Kimiya-yi sa'ādat has been translated into Urdu, Turkish, Azerbaijani, and German. Husayn-Khadiv-i Jam edited the first half of the Persian text nearly two decades ago. This version is considered to be the most beneficial, as it improves upon the past editions by Ahmad Ahram and Muhammad Abbasi.\n\nIn 1910, Claud Field published an abridged translation of the Kimiya-yi Sa'ādat utilizing the Urdu translation of the Persian text as well as an earlier English paraphrase of a Turkish translation by Muhammad Mustafa an-Nawali. Elton L. Daniel, a professor of Islamic history at the University of Hawaii, compared the texts given to him by Claud Field to the Persian edition and reorganized the sequence of the chapters and paragraph divisions in order to get them to correlate better with the original Kimiya-yi Sa'ādat. He also added annotations indicating the areas in which Field's translation varies from the original Kimiya-yi Sa'ādat, where certain texts were omitted/condensed, and identifies many of the individuals and Qur'anic citations found in the text.

Within the work he unveiled the epistemological perspective of positivism. The works were translated into English by Harriet Martineau and condensed to form \"The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte\" (1853).\n\nThe first three volumes of the \"Course\" dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science. It is in observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, that Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex \"queen science\" of human society itself. His \"A General View of Positivism\" (published in English in 1865) would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociology.\n"}

It was written by Carlos Castaneda and submitted as his Master's thesis in the school of Anthropology. It purports to document the events that took place during an apprenticeship with a self-proclaimed Yaqui Indian Sorcerer, don Juan Matus from Sonora, Mexico between 1960 and 1965.\n\nThe book is divided into two sections. The first section, \"The Teachings\", is a first-person narrative that documents Castaneda's initial interactions with don Juan. He speaks of his encounters with Mescalito (a teaching spirit inhabiting all peyote plants), divination with lizards and flying using the \"yerba del diablo\" (lit. \"Devil's Weed\"; Jimson weed), and turning into a blackbird using \"humito\" (lit. \"little smoke\"; a smoked powder containing Psilocybe mexicana). The second, \"A Structural Analysis\", is an attempt, Castaneda says, at \"disclos[ing] the internal cohesion and the cogency of don Juan’s Teachings.\"\n\nThe 30th-anniversary edition, published by the University of California Press in 1998, contains commentary by Castaneda not present in the original edition. He writes of a general discouragement from the project by his professors (besides Clement Meighan, a professor who supported the project early in its conception. In the foreword, Castaneda gives \"full credit\" for the approval of his dissertation to Meighan). He offers a new thesis on a mind-state he calls \"total freedom\" and claims that he used the teachings of his Yaqui shaman as \"springboards into new horizons of cognition\". In addition, it contains a foreword by anthropologist Walter Goldschmidt, who was a professor of anthropology at UCLA during the time the books were written, and an introduction by the author. A 40th anniversary edition was published by the University of California Press in 2008.\n\n\"The Teachings\" is referenced in the 2013 film \"A Case of You\", in which the protagonist reads the book to impress his dream girl. \n\n"}

In contrast to the original DST the TBM propagates the open-world assumption that relaxes the assumption that all possible outcomes are known. Under the open world assumption Dempster's rule of combination is adapted such that there is no normalization. The underlying idea is that the probability mass pertaining to the empty set is taken to indicate an unexpected outcome, e.g. the belief in a hypothesis outside the frame of discernment. This adaptation violates the probabilistic character of the original DST and also Bayesian inference. Therefore, the authors substituted notation such as \"probability masses\" and \"probability update\" with terms such as \"degrees of belief\" and \"transfer\" giving rise to the name of the method: The \"transferable belief model\".\nLofti Zadeh describes an information fusion problem. A patient has an illness that can be caused by three different factors \"A\", \"B\" or \"C\". Doctor 1 says that the patient's illness is very likely to be caused by A (very likely, meaning probability \"p\" = 0.95), but \"B\" is also possible but not likely (\"p\" = 0.05). Doctor 2 says that the cause is very likely \"C\" (\"p\" = 0.95), but \"B\" is also possible but not likely (\"p\" = 0.05). How is one to make one's own opinion from this?\n\nBayesian updating the first opinion with the second (or the other way round) implies certainty that the cause is \"B\". Dempster's rule of combination lead to the same result. This can be seen as paradoxical, since although the two doctors point at different causes, \"A\" and \"C\", they both agree that \"B\" is not likely. (For this reason the standard Bayesian approach is to adopt Cromwell's rule and avoid the use of 0 or 1 as probabilities.)\n\nThe TBM describes beliefs at two levels:\n\nAccording to the DST, a probability mass function formula_1 is defined such that:\nwith\nwhere the power set formula_4 contains all possible subsets of the frame of discernment formula_5. In contrast to the DST the mass formula_6 allocated to the empty set formula_7 is not required to be zero, and hence generally formula_8 holds true. The underlying idea is that the frame of discernment is not necessarily exhaustive, and thus belief allocated to a proposition formula_9, is in fact allocated to formula_10 where formula_11 is the set of unknown outcomes. Consequently, the combination rule underlying the TBM corresponds to Dempster's rule of combination, except the normalization that grants formula_12. Hence, in the TBM any two independent functions formula_13 and formula_14 are combined to a single function formula_15 by:\n\nwhere\n\nIn the TBM the \"degree of belief\" in a hypothesis formula_18 is defined by a function:\nwith\n\nWhen a decision must be made the \"credal beliefs\" are transferred to pignistic probabilities by:\nwhere formula_23 denote the atoms (also denoted as singletons) and formula_24 the number of atoms formula_25 that appear in formula_26. Hence, probability masses formula_27 are equally distributed among the atoms of A.\nThis strategy corresponds to the principle of insufficient reason (also denoted as principle of maximum entropy) according to which an \"unknown\" distribution most probably corresponds to a uniform distribution.\nIn the TBM \"pignistic probability functions\" are described by functions formula_28. Such a function satisfies the probability axioms:\nwith\n\nPhilip Smets introduced them as \"pignistic\" to stress the fact that those probability functions are based on incomplete data, whose only purpose is a forced decision, e.g. to place a bet. This is in contrast to the \"credal beliefs\" described above, whose purpose is representing the actual \"belief\".\n\nWhen tossing a coin one usually assumes that Head or Tail will occur, so that formula_32. The open-world assumption is that the coin can be stolen in mid-air, disappear, break apart or otherwise fall sideways so that neither Head nor Tail occurs, so that the power set of {Head,Tail} is considered and there is a decomposition of the overall probability (i.e. 1) of the following form:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "604707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=604707", "title": "Truth function", "text": "Truth function\n\nIn logic, a truth function is a function that accepts truth values as input and produces a truth value as output, i.e., the input and output are all truth values. The typical example is in propositional logic, wherein a compound statement is constructed by one or two statements connected by a logical connective; if the truth value of the compound statement is determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a truth function, and the logical connective is said to be truth functional.\n\nClassical propositional logic is a truth-functional propositional logic, in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent truth table), thus every compound statement is a truth function. On the contrary, modal logic is non-truth-functional.\n\nA logical connective is truth-functional if the truth-value of a compound sentence is a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences. A class of connectives is truth-functional if each of its members is. For example, the connective \"\"and\" is truth-functional since a sentence like \"Apples are fruits and carrots are vegetables\" is true \"if, and only if\" each of its sub-sentences \"apples are fruits\" and \"carrots are vegetables\"\" is true, and it is false otherwise. Some connectives of a natural language, such as English, are not truth-functional.\n\nConnectives of the form \"x \"believes that\" ...\" are typical examples of connectives that are not truth-functional. If e.g. Mary mistakenly believes that Al Gore was President of the USA on April 20, 2000, but she does not believe that the moon is made of green cheese, then the sentence\n\nis true while\n\nis false. In both cases, each component sentence (i.e. \"Al Gore was president of the USA on April 20, 2000\" and \"the moon is made of green cheese\") is false, but each compound sentence formed by prefixing the phrase \"Mary believes that\" differs in truth-value. That is, the truth-value of a sentence of the form \"Mary believes that...\"\" is not determined solely by the truth-value of its component sentence, and hence the (unary) connective (or simply \"operator\" since it is unary) is non-truth-functional.\n\nThe class of classical logic connectives (e.g. &, →) used in the construction of formulas is truth-functional. Their values for various truth-values as argument are usually given by truth tables. Truth-functional propositional calculus is a formal system whose formulae may be interpreted as either true or false.\n\nIn two-valued logic, there are sixteen possible truth functions, also called Boolean functions, of two inputs \"P\" and \"Q\". Any of these functions corresponds to a truth table of a certain logical connective in classical logic, including several degenerate cases such as a function not depending on one or both of its arguments. Truth and falsehood is denoted as 1 and 0 in the following truth tables, respectively, for sake of brevity.\n\nBecause a function may be expressed as a composition, a truth-functional logical calculus does not need to have dedicated symbols for all of the above-mentioned functions to be functionally complete. This is expressed in a propositional calculus as logical equivalence of certain compound statements. For example, classical logic has equivalent to . The conditional operator \"→\" is therefore not necessary for a classical-based logical system if \"¬\" (not) and \"∨\" (or) are already in use.\n\nA minimal set of operators that can express every statement expressible in the propositional calculus is called a \"minimal functionally complete set\". A minimally complete set of operators is achieved by NAND alone {↑} and NOR alone {↓}.\n\nThe following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators whose arities do not exceed 2:\n\nSome truth functions possess properties which may be expressed in the theorems containing the corresponding connective. Some of those properties that a binary truth function (or a corresponding logical connective) may have are:\n\n\nA set of truth functions is functionally complete if and only if for each of the following five properties it contains at least one member lacking it:\n\nA concrete function may be also referred to as an \"operator\". In two-valued logic there are 2 nullary operators (constants), 4 unary operators, 16 binary operators, 256 ternary operators, and formula_33 \"n\"-ary operators. In three-valued logic there are 3 nullary operators (constants), 27 unary operators, 19683 binary operators, 7625597484987 ternary operators, and formula_34 \"n\"-ary operators. In \"k\"-valued logic, there are \"k\" nullary operators, formula_35 unary operators, formula_36 binary operators, formula_37 ternary operators, and formula_38 \"n\"-ary operators. An \"n\"-ary operator in \"k\"-valued logic is a function from formula_39. Therefore, the number of such operators is formula_40, which is how the above numbers were derived.\n\nHowever, some of the operators of a particular arity are actually degenerate forms that perform a lower-arity operation on some of the inputs and ignores the rest of the inputs. Out of the 256 ternary boolean operators cited above, formula_41 of them are such degenerate forms of binary or lower-arity operators, using the inclusion–exclusion principle. The ternary operator formula_42 is one such operator which is actually a unary operator applied to one input, and ignoring the other two inputs.\n\n\"Not\" is a unary operator, it takes a single term (¬\"P\"). The rest are binary operators, taking two terms to make a compound statement (\"P\" ∧ \"Q\", \"P\" ∨ \"Q\", \"P\" → \"Q\", \"P\" ↔ \"Q\").\n\nThe set of logical operators may be partitioned into disjoint subsets as follows:\n\nIn this partition, formula_44 is the set of operator symbols of \"arity\" .\n\nIn the more familiar propositional calculi, formula_45 is typically partitioned as follows:\n\nInstead of using truth tables, logical connective symbols can be interpreted by means of an interpretation function and a functionally complete set of truth-functions (Gamut 1991), as detailed by the principle of compositionality of meaning.\nLet \"I\" be an interpretation function, let \"Φ\", \"Ψ\" be any two sentences and let the truth function \"f\" be defined as:\n\nThen, for convenience, \"f\", \"f\" \"f\" and so on are defined by means of \"f\":\n\n\nor, alternatively \"f\", \"f\" \"f\" and so on are defined directly:\n\n\nThen\n\netc.\n\nThus if \"S\" is a sentence that is a string of symbols consisting of logical symbols \"v\"...\"v\" representing logical connectives, and non-logical symbols \"c\"...\"c\", then if and only if have been provided interpreting \"v\" to \"v\" by means of \"f\" (or any other set of functional complete truth-functions) then the truth-value of is determined entirely by the truth-values of \"c\"...\"c\", i.e. of . In other words, as expected and required, \"S\" is true or false only under an interpretation of all its non-logical symbols.\n\nLogical operators are implemented as logic gates in digital circuits. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is DRAM) are built up from NAND, NOR, NOT, and transmission gates. NAND and NOR gates with 3 or more inputs rather than the usual 2 inputs are fairly common, although they are logically equivalent to a cascade of 2-input gates. All other operators are implemented by breaking them down into a logically equivalent combination of 2 or more of the above logic gates.\n\nThe \"logical equivalence\" of \"NAND alone\", \"NOR alone\", and \"NOT and AND\" is similar to Turing equivalence.\n\nThe fact that all truth functions can be expressed with NOR alone is demonstrated by the Apollo guidance computer.\n\n\n\n"}
