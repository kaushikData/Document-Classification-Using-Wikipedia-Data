He earned a Ph.D. in 1928 under Wacław Sierpiński and habilitated at Warsaw University in 1934. He published works on mathematical logic, set theory, cardinal and ordinal arithmetic, the axiom of choice, the continuum hypothesis, theory of functions, measure theory, point set topology, geometry and real analysis. He served as an Assistant Professor at Warsaw University from 1935 until the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was Alfred Tarski's closest collaborator of the inter-war period. Around the end of October or beginning of November 1935 he married Janina Hosiasson, a fellow logician of the Lwow-Warsaw school. He and his wife were adherents of Logical Empiricism, participated in and contributed to the International Unity of Science movement, and were members of the original Vienna Circle. Sometime before the middle of August 1941 he and his sister Stefanja were shot to death in Naujoji Vilnia (Nowa Wilejka), 7 km east of Vilnius, by the occupying German forces or Lithuanian collaborators.\n\nHis most cited works are Lindenbaum's lemma and Lindenbaum algebras.\n\n"}
{"id": "34769236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34769236", "title": "Allorecognition", "text": "Allorecognition\n\nAllorecognition is the ability of an individual organism to distinguish its own tissues from those of another. It manifests itself in the recognition of antigens expressed on the surface of cells of non-self origin. Allorecognition has been described in nearly all multicellular phyla.\n\nThis article focuses on allorecognition from the standpoint of its significance in the evolution of multicellular organisms. For other articles which focus on its importance in medicine, molecular biology, and so forth, the following topics are recommended as well as those in the Categories links at the bottom of this page.\n\nThe ability to discriminate between self and non-self is a fundamental requirement for life. At the most basic level, even single-celled organisms need to be able to distinguish between food and non-food, to respond appropriately to invading pathogens, and to avoid cannibalism. In sexually reproducing organisms, self/non-self discrimination is essential to ensuring species-specific egg/sperm interaction during fertilization. Hermaphroditic organisms, such as annelids and certain plants, require recognition mechanisms to prevent self-fertilization. Such functions are all carried out by the innate immune system, which employs evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors to eliminate cells displaying \"nonself markers.\"\n\nThe evolution of multicellularity brought about various challenges, many of which could be met by increasingly sophisticated innate immune systems, but which also served as an evolutionary driving force for the development of adaptive immune systems. The adaptive or \"specific\" immune system in its fully qualified form (\"i.e.\" based on major histocompatibility complex (MHC), T-cell receptors (TCR), and antibodies) exists only in jawed vertebrates, but an independently evolved adaptive immune system has been identified in hagfish and lampreys (non-jawed vertebrates).\n\nMulticellularity has arisen independently dozens of times in the history of life, in plants, animals, fungi, and prokaryotes, appearing first several billion years ago in cyanobacteria. Two categories of advantages have been attributed to the early development of multicellular existence: advantages related to size, and advantages related to functional specialization and division of labor. Size advantages may include greater feeding efficiency or increased robustness. For example, myxobacteria, moving in swarms, are able to maintain a high concentration of extracellular enzymes used to digest food, from which all the bacteria in the swarm benefit. Under various conditions, many microorganisms form biofilms which provide them with a protected environment. In organisms that have evolved functional specialization, an important division of labor may exist over reproduction: only a small fraction of cells contribute to the next generation. Somatic growth represents a form of altruism, where somatic cells give up reproduction helping germline cells reproduce.\n\nThe extracellular enzymes secreted by swarming bacteria, the slime of a biofilm, or the soma cells in a differentiated organism represent public goods which are vulnerable to exploitation by cheaters. This issue is well known in economics and evolutionary biology as the \"free rider problem\" or the \"tragedy of the commons.\" A free rider (or freeloader) is an individual that consumes a resource without paying for it, or pays less than the full cost. In multicellular organisms, cheaters may arise from mutations in somatic cells that no longer contribute to the common good, or ignore controls on their reproduction. Another possibility may arise from somatic fusion: there are multicellular life-styles where there are few if any physical barriers to the intermingling of cells (for example: sponges, fungal mycelia) and even among organisms that have evolved physical integuments representing a first line of defense against invasion, opportunities for cellular exchange occur. Witness, for example, the spread of devil facial tumour disease among Tasmanian devils and transmissible venereal tumor in dogs.\n\nIn metazoans, defense against disruption of the multicellular life style by such cheaters takes two major forms. First, a consistent feature of the multicellular life cycle is the interposition of a unicellular phase, even among organisms whose major mode of propagation may be via many-celled vegetative propagules. This unicellular phase usually takes the form of a sexually produced zygote. Passage through a unicellular bottleneck assures that each representative of the next generation of organisms represents a distinct clone. Some offspring will carry a large number of deleterious mutations and will die off, while other offspring will carry few. In this manner, the organism bypasses \"Muller's ratchet,\" the process by which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner. The second defense against cheaters is the development of allorecognition mechanisms that guard against invasion by parasitic replicators. Allorecognition acts as an agent of kin selection by restricting fusion and community acceptance to related individuals. If related individuals fuse, the benefits of fusion will still apply, while the costs of competition for shared resources or reproductive opportunities will be reduced by a fraction proportional to the degree of relatedness between the fusing partners. If unrelated individuals fuse, or if a mutated cell arises within an organism that is distinguishable from self by the allorecognition system, a rejection response will be activated. As a general rule, rejection is mediated by the gene products of highly variable loci, which must match (or nearly match) between organisms for fusion to be successful.\n\nAllorecognition phenomena have been recognized in bacterial self-identity and social recognition systems, kin discrimination in social amoebae, fungal mating types, fungal vegetative incompatibility, plant self-incompatibility systems, colonial marine invertebrates (such as corals, sponges, hydroids, bryozoans, and ascidians), and of course, vertebrates. The manner in which allorecognition manifests itself in these different systems varies greatly. Bacteria, for instance, secrete bacteriocins, proteinaceous toxins specifically targeted against members of their own species. Colonies of marine invertebrates, each representing a single genotype, expand across the ocean floor by asexual reproduction. Where colonies meet, they may, if compatible, fuse to form a single unit, or if incompatible, they may aggressively attempt to overgrow, poison, sting, or consume each other.\n\nVertebrate immunity is dependent on both adaptive and innate immune systems. In vertebrates, the innate immune system is composed of cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (which also have a role in the adaptive immune system as antigen presenting cells), as well as molecular pathways such as the complement system which react to microbial non-self. The innate immune system enables a rapid inflammatory response that contains the infection, and it activates the adaptive immune system, which eliminates the pathogen and, through immunological memory, provides long term protection against reinfection.\n\nComprehensive sequence searches across multiple taxonomic groups have failed to identify MHC and TCRs outside of the jawed vertebrates. Allorecognition in these animals rely on molecular mechanisms distinct from those of the jawed vertebrates. In sponges, various receptors (sponge adhesion molecules, receptor tyrosine kinase) with domains similar to those found in immunoglobulins have been identified. Sequence variability in \"hot spots\" have been identified in these receptors. It would appear that molecules which, later in evolution, were exploited in the adaptive immune response, had an earlier role in innate recognition. Lampreys and hagfish appear to have evolved, by convergent evolution, an adaptive immune response that is independent and distinct from the adaptive immune systems of higher vertebrates. Lymphocyte-like cells in these fish express highly variable lymphocyte receptor genes, which undergo somatic rearrangements reminiscent of the manner in which mammalian immunoglobulin genes are rearranged during development.\n\nIn summary, allorecognition, the ability to distinguish self from non-self, is basic to all life, unicellular as well as multicellular. The earliest recognition systems were innate, and were based on the recognition of self molecules. The evolution of multicellular forms brought about selective pressures for ever-increasing sophistication to innate immune systems. Adaptive immune systems, based on the recognition of non-self, have arisen independently in two lines of chordates, and exploit molecules and cellular systems which had a previous role in innate immune responses. Allorecognition as it currently exists in mammals can be traced back as the result of sequential modification to immunity mechanisms dating back to some of the earliest multicellular organisms.\n"}

{"id": "155025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155025", "title": "Byzantine text-type", "text": "Byzantine text-type\n\nThe Byzantine text-type (also called Majority Text, Traditional Text, Ecclesiastical Text, Constantinopolitan Text, Antiocheian Text, or Syrian Text) is one of several text-types used in textual criticism to describe the textual character of Greek New Testament manuscripts. It is the form found in the largest number of surviving manuscripts, though not in the oldest. The New Testament text of the Orthodox Church, the Patriarchal Text, as well as those utilized in the lectionaries, is based on this text-type. While considerably varying, it also underlies the Textus Receptus Greek text used for most Reformation-era translations of the New Testament into vernacular languages. Modern translations mainly use Eclectic editions that conform more often to the Alexandrian text-type.\n\nThe Byzantine text is also found in a few modern Orthodox editions, as the Byzantine textual tradition has continued in the Eastern Orthodox Church into the present time. The text used by the Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts. It is commonly accepted as standard Byzantine text.\n\nThe Byzantine textform is often marked with the abbreviations formula_1 or Byz.\n\nFor some time following the fourth century different types of text were current in the East, but at the end the Byzantine text \"almost wholly displaced the rest.\" The Byzantine text-type has by far the largest number of surviving manuscripts, many of them written in the newer minuscule (lower case) style and in Polytonic orthography handwriting, which had been invented in the 3rd century BC by Aristophanes of Byzantium but which took many centuries to catch on outside scholarly circles. For example, of 522 complete or nearly complete manuscripts of the General Epistles collated by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Münster, Germany, 372 of them attest the Byzantine reading in at least 90% of 98 test places. Amongst the earliest surviving manuscripts, the position is reversed. There are six manuscripts earlier than the 9th century which conform to the Byzantine text-type; of which the 5th century Codex Alexandrinus (the oldest), is Byzantine only in the Gospels with the rest of the New Testament being Alexandrian. By comparison, the Alexandrian text-type is witnessed by nine surviving uncials earlier than the ninth century (including the Codex Alexandrinus outside the Gospels); and is also usually considered to be demonstrated in three earlier papyri. Modern critical editions of the New Testament tend to conform most often to Alexandrian witnesses — especially Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus.\n\nThe earliest Church Father to witness to a Byzantine text-type in substantial New Testament quotations is John Chrysostom (c. 349 — 407); although the fragmentary surviving works of Asterius the Sophist († 341) have also been considered to conform to the Byzantine text, and the incomplete surviving translation of Wulfila (d. 383) into Gothic is often thought to derive from the Byzantine text type or an intermediary between the Byzantine and Western text types. Chrysostom and Asterius used text only in 75% agreed with the standard Byzantine text. The second earliest translation to witness to a Greek base conforming generally to the Byzantine text in the Gospels is the Syriac Peshitta (though it has many Alexandrian and Western readings); usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century; although in respect of several much contested readings, such as Mark 1:2 and John 1:18, the Peshitta rather supports the Alexandrian witnesses. Dating from the fourth century, and hence possibly earlier than the Peshitta, is the Ethiopic version of the Gospels; best represented by the surviving fifth and sixth century manuscripts of the Garima Gospels and classified by Rochus Zuurmond as \"early Byzantine\". Zuurmond notes that, especially in the Gospel of John, the form of the early Byzantine text found in the Ethiopic Gospels is quite different from the later Greek Majority Text, and agrees in a number of places with Papyrus 66.\n\nThe form of the Byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole, and sometimes differs from a Byzantine sub-group of manuscripts that proliferated after the 11th century. Amongst the bulk of later manuscripts however, it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear Byzantine majority reading for each variant; and a Greek New Testament text based on these majority readings — \"The Majority Text\" — has been produced by Zane C. Hodges and Arthur L. Farstad, although this text does not correspond to any one particular manuscript.\n\n\n𝔓\n\n\nCodex Mutinensis, Codex Cyprius, Codex Mosquensis I, Campianus, Petropolitanus Purp., Sinopensis,

display fewer instances of textual variation between parallel Synoptic Gospel passages, and they are less likely to present contradictory or \"difficult\" issues of exegesis. For example, Mark 1:2 reads \"As it is written in the prophets...\" in the Byzantine text; whereas the same verse reads, \"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet...\" in all other early textual witnesses. Since the quotation introduced is partly from Malachi, the Byzantine form of the verse avoids the difficulty that might be adduced were it to be concluded that Mark was presenting a factual inaccuracy.\n\nAnother characteristic is the grammar (e.g., οι δε ειπον; in Alexandrian text: οι δε ειπαν) and the different order of words. For example:\n\nJohn 6:49\n\nMark 1:9\n\nAlso, the Byzantine text does not contain verses included by Textus Receptus: Luke 17:36; Acts 8:37; 15:34.\n\nThere are no consistent Byzantine witnesses amongst the early New Testament papyri. Nevertheless, instances of distinctive Byzantine readings are not unusual in the earliest texts — even though they otherwise conform more to other text-types or none. Hence, many (and possibly most) distinctive Byzantine readings are likely to be early in date. Two broad explanations have been offered for this observation:\n\n\nGospel of Matthew 2:18\n\n\nMatthew 5:25\n\n\nMatthew 10:4\n\n\nMatthew 14:12\n\n\nMatthew 15:6\n\n\nMatthew 15:6\n\n\nMatthew 15:8\n\n\nGospel of Mark 1:13\n\n\nGospel of Mark 4:24\n\n\nGospel of Mark 6:33\n\n\nMark 6:51\n\n\nMark 7:8\n\n\nMark 9:49\n\n\nLuke 2:38\n\n\nLuke 7:10\n\n\nLuke 12:14\n\n\nLast verse in Gospel of Luke (24:53)\n\n\nJohn 1:18\n\n\n\nActs 27:41\n\nIn Romans 8:1\n\n1 Corinthians 2:1\n\n1 Corinthians 7:5\n\n1 Corinthians 11:24\n\nIn Mark 6:33 and Luke 24:53 the Byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Western text. In other cases the situation is more complicated. Mark 1:13 looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Caesarean text.\n\nIn order to displace the Textus Receptus (see the following section) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the Greek New Testament, later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the Byzantine text which formed its base. This Wescott and Hort's Introduction accomplished in masterful detail (over the course of 600 pages) as the culmination of 28 years of laborious effort on their part.\n\nThey summarize the problem early on in their work (p. 45) as follows:\n\"A theoretical presumption indeed remains that a majority of extant documents is more likely to represent a majority of ancestral documents at each stage of transmission than vice versa.\" In the discussion that follows, they reason that the \"incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work\" in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that \"every ground for expecting 'a priori' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground.\"\n\nAmong those modern scholars who believe that the Byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs, there is some debate concerning the origin of the Byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use. The suggestions that have been put forward are:\n\n\nThe standard Byzantine text used by the Eastern, Greek-speaking Greek Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century. However, some are earlier and a few papyri are also classified here. The early Byzantine text is near to the Alexandrian text in that it differs from the late Byzantine text in roughly 3000 places. Kurt Aland did not consider early Byzantine families such as E and Π to be classified as Byzantine manuscripts. He placed some of them into Category III of the Greek New Testament manuscripts. Aland placed all manuscripts with standard Byzantine text into Category V.\n\nThe first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by Erasmus and published by Johann Froben of Basel on March 1, 1516 (Novum Instrumentum omne). Due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing Complutensian Polyglot, Erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the Byzantine text-type. Six verses that were not witnessed in any of these sources, he back-translated from the Latin Vulgate, and Erasmus also introduced many readings from the Vulgate and Church Fathers. This text came to be known as the \"Textus Receptus\" or \"received text\" after being thus termed by Bonaventura Elzevir, an enterprising publisher from the Netherlands, in his 1633 edition of Erasmus' text. The New Testament of the King James Version of the Bible was translated from editions of what was to become the \"Textus Receptus\". The different Byzantine \"Majority Text\" of Hodges & Farstad as well as Robinson & Pierpont is called \"Majority\" because it is considered to be the Greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the Greek manuscripts. The Textus Receptus differs from the Majority Text in 1,838 Greek readings, of which 1,005 represent \"translatable\" differences.\n\nKarl Lachmann (1850) was the first New Testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the \"Textus Receptus\", relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the Alexandrian text-type. Although the majority of New Testament textual critics now favor a text that is Alexandrian in complexion, especially after the publication of Westcott and Hort's edition, there remain some proponents of the Byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs. These critics include the editors of the Hodges and Farstad text (cited below), and the Robinson and Pierpont text. Depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the Alexandrian text-type, then this will differ from the Hodges and Farstad text in around 6,500 readings (Wallace 1989).\n\nTo give a feel for the difference between the Byzantine form of text and the Eclectic text, which is mainly Alexandrian in character, of 800 variation units in the Epistle of James collected by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research, the Byzantine and Eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places (a rate of 92.3%). Many of the 69 disagreements involve differences in word order and other variants that do not appear as translatable differences in English versions. According to the preface to the New King James Version of the Bible, the Textus Receptus, the Alexandrian text-type and the Byzantine text-type are 85% identical (that is, of the variations that occur in any manuscript, only 15% actually differ between these three).\n\nThe Byzantine type is also found in modern Greek Orthodox editions. A new scholarly edition of the Byzantine Text of John's gospel, (funded by the United Bible Societies in response to a request from Eastern Orthodox Scholars), was begun in Birmingham, UK. and in 2007, as a result of these efforts, \"The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition\" was published.\n\nVon Soden divided manuscripts of the Byzantine text into five groups:\n\n\nSince the discovery of the Papyrus 45, Papyrus 46, and Papyrus 66, proof is available that occasionally the Byzantine text preserves a reading that dates from early witness. Examples:\n\nLuke 10:39\n\nLuke 10:42\n\nLuke 11:33\n\nJohn 10:29\n\nJohn 11:32\n\nJohn 13:26\n\nActs 17:13\n\n1 Corinthians 9:7\n\nEphesians 5:9\n\nPhilippians 1:14\n\nOther examples of Byzantine readings were found in p in John 1:32; 3:24; 4:14.51; 5:8; 6:10.57; 7:3.39; 8:41.51.55; 9:23; 10:38; 12:36; 14:17. This supports the views of scholars such as Harry Sturz (1984) and Maurice Robinson (2005) that the roots of the Byzantine text may go back to a very early date. (In 1963 Bruce Metzger had argued that early support for Byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text.) Some authors have interpreted this as a rehabilitation of Textus Receptus. Many of these readings have substantial support from other text-types and they are not distinctively Byzantine. Daniel Wallace found only two agreements distinctively between papyrus and Byzantine readings.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1345250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1345250", "title": "Christian materialism", "text": "Christian materialism\n\nChristian materialism is the combination of Christian theology with the ideas of (ontological) materialism, which says that matter is a fundamental substance of the world and mental phenomenon are part of it.\n\nThroughout history, Christian thought has struggled with the ideas of flesh, world, and spirit, and their interplay in each person's salvation. As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said in \"What It Means To Be a Christian\" (2006), “Christian theology... in the course of time turned the kingdom of God into a kingdom of heaven that is beyond this mortal life; the well-being of men became a salvation of souls, which again comes to pass beyond this life, after death.\" \n\nThis tendency of spiritualization, Ratzinger said, is not the message of Jesus Christ. \"For what is sublime in this message,\" he stated, \"is precisely that the Lord was talking not just about another life, not just about men’s souls, but was addressing the body, the whole man, in his embodied form, with his involvement in history and society; that he promised the kingdom of God to the man who lives bodily with other men in this history.\"\n\nThe most visible use of the term is found in the writings of Josemaría Escrivá, a Spanish Catholic saint of the twentieth century, who said that all temporal realities have a sanctifying power and Christians can find God in the most ordinary material things. As such, it is associated with the Roman Catholic prelature of Opus Dei which Escriva founded. It is an organization which teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life, even the most material activity, is a path to sanctity. \n\nEscriva criticized those who \"have tried to present the Christian way of life as something exclusively spiritual, proper to pure, extraordinary people, who remain aloof from the contemptible things of this world, or at most tolerate them as something necessarily attached to the spirit, while we live on this earth. When things are seen in this way, churches become the setting par excellence of the Christian life. And being a Christian means going to church, taking part in sacred ceremonies, being taken up with ecclesiastical matters, in a kind of segregated world, which is considered to be the ante-chamber of heaven, while the ordinary world follows its own separate path.\"\n\nInstead, he affirmed the \"high value of the material.\" According to him, \"Authentic Christianity which professes the resurrection of all flesh, has always quite logically opposed 'dis-incarnation,' without fear of being judged materialistic. We can, therefore, rightfully speak of a \"Christian materialism,\" which is boldly opposed to those materialisms which are blind to the spirit.\" (Italics added; see also )\n\nIn an address to a theological symposium, \"Holiness and the World\", which studied the teachings of Josemaria Escriva, John Paul II referred to one of his homilies: \n\nIn connection with this quote, John Paul II said that the Catholic Church today is \"conscious of serving a redemption that concerns every aspect of human existence,\" an awareness which was \"prepared by a gradual intellectual and spiritual development.\" He also said that the message of Escriva, which has contributed in this direction, stems \"from a unique grasp of the radiant, universal force of the Redeemer's grace.\" He later called Escriva \"one of Christianity's great witnesses.\"\n"}

The practice was developed in 1995 by Dunya Dianne McPherson after completing 1001 days of Sufi training with Sufi Master Adnan Sarhan. The materials resourced provide doorways and ignition points to embodied spiritual illumination, healing, and growth. Teaching Dancemeditation means to come from the embodied practices that have been honed within the practicing Dancemeditation community over the past 20 years.\n\nDancemeditation can be done alone, as a personal practice. It is primarily offered in group environments with approximately – of the session engaged in shared, side-by-side solitude with the remaining time devoted to group interaction. \"Shared Solitude\" can include quiet exercises with eyes closed on one’s mat, to active dancing with eyes closed. Group interactions include partner and small group exercises, entire group improvisation, and circles led by individuals. Dancemeditation is occasionally offered in private session according to the teacher’s preference, demographic, and goals. There is an annual Movement Monastery which is a retreat period under the direction of Principal Teacher Dunya Dianne McPherson.\n\nThe official school of Dancemeditation is a network of independent, inter-connected teachers who have completed an intensive Certification training with Founder. The training is completed primarily at Movement Monastery which includes time in a secluded setting to focus on practices, body cleansing diet, spiritual discussion, and silence. In order to receive the initial Certificate level, teachers have completed 80 days of dedicated training. Advanced Levels of Teaching Certification with more stringent criteria follow.Teachers offer work in various formats and locations. Many events are public offerings. In addition, Dancemeditation teachers work through institutional settings—universities, hospitals, school systems.\n\nDancemeditation allows practitioners to explore and experience that which is deep, profound, and spiritual without having to adopt or contain that experience in a belief system. In Dancemeditation, practitioners are free to follow their own intuition to where it needs to leads them. A helpful guiding comment comes from Sufi Shervin Nekuee, (director of the Mystic Festival in Netherlands.) \"Who am I to judge your mysticism?\" regarding Dancemeditation as a Sufi practice.\n\nDancemeditation doesn't ask its practitioners to define a higher power, or even have one, nor does it prevent them from having one. It is primarily an ecumenical spiritual system, or a spiritual system that embraces interfaith pluralism. There has never been, nor will there be, a request to follow doctrine.\n\nThe Path of Dancemeditation is a full valid Path in itself. It is not an ancillary discipline to any other established Path. \nAt the same time, the Path of Dancemeditation does not obstruct practitioners from including other work on an equal level with the Path of Dancemeditation within their own hearts and efforts.\n\nThe music for Dancemeditation is primarily acoustic or \"mildly enhanced\". Genres include world music, contemplative, classical, folk much of which has no lyrics or lyrics in languages that students will not typically understand. This allows for deeper levels of concentration within the Self as opposed to the lyrics moving the emotions.\n\nBasic components include:\n\nBasic practice subjects include:\n\nSpiritual belly dance components of Dancemeditation consists of the following subjects and exercises.\n\nSpiritual belly dance has been offered at Kripalu since 2009. \nSummer Movement Monasteries are offered yearly for two weeks in June.\nLong and short training intensives, weekly classes, gatherings, performances and workshops are offered by Dunya, as well as by over 30 licensed instructors, internationally.\n\n\n\n"}

He established friendships with György Lukács, Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W. Adorno. Bloch's work focuses on the thesis that in a humanistic world where oppression and exploitation have been eliminated there will always be a truly revolutionary force.\n\nBloch was born in Ludwigshafen, the son of a Jewish railway-employee. After studying philosophy, he married Else von Stritzky, daughter of a Baltic brewer in 1913, who died in 1921. His second marriage with Linda Oppenheimer lasted only a few years. His third wife was Karola Piotrowska, a Polish architect, whom he married in 1934 in Vienna. When the Nazis came to power, they had to flee, first into Switzerland, then to Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, and finally the United States.\n\nIn 1948, Bloch was offered the chair of philosophy at the University of Leipzig, and he returned to East Germany to take up the position. In 1955 he was awarded the National Prize of the GDR. In addition, he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin (AdW). He had more or less become the political philosopher of the GDR. Among his many academic students from this period was his assistant Manfred Buhr, who earned his doctorate with him in 1957, and was later professor in Greifswald, then director of the Central Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences (ADC) in Berlin and who became a critic of Bloch.\n\nHowever, the Hungarian uprising in 1956 led Bloch to revise his view of the SED (Socialist Unity Party) regime, whilst retaining his Marxist orientation. Because he advocated humanistic ideas of freedom, he was obliged to retire in 1957 for political reasons – not because of his age, 72 years. A number of scientists and students spoke publicly against this forced retirement, among them the renowned professor and colleague Emil Fuchs and his students as well as Fuchs's grandson .\n\nWhen the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, he did not return to the GDR, but went to Tübingen in West Germany, where he received an honorary chair in Philosophy. He died in Tübingen.\n\nBloch's \"The Principle of Hope\" was written during his emigration in the United States, where he lived briefly in New Hampshire before settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He wrote the lengthy three-volume work in the reading room of Harvard's Widener Library. Bloch originally planned to publish it there under the title \"Dreams of a Better Life\". \"The Principle of Hope\" tries to provide an encyclopedic account of mankind's and nature's orientation towards a socially and technologically improved future.\n\nBloch's work became very influential in the course of the student protest movements in 1968 and in liberation theology. \nIt is cited as a key influence by Jürgen Moltmann in his \"Theology of Hope\" (1967, Harper and Row, New York), by Dorothee Sölle, and by Ernesto Balducci. Psychoanalyst Joel Kovel has praised Bloch as, \"the greatest of modern utopian thinkers\". Robert S. Corrington has been influenced by Bloch, though he has tried to adapt Bloch's ideas to serve a liberal rather than a Marxist politics. Bloch's concept of concrete utopias found in \"The Principle of Hope\" was used by José Esteban Muñoz to shift the field of performance studies. This shift allowed for the emergence of utopian performativity and a new wave of performance theorizing as Bloch's formulation of utopia shifted how scholars conceptualize the ontology and the staging of performances as imbued with an enduring indeterminacy, as opposed to dominant performance theories found in the work of Peggy Phelan, who view performance as a life event without reproduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Vilarós, Hayden White, and with a broad response of Marramao). Of this volume was published an Italian edition: \"Filosofia dei mondi globali. Conversazioni con Giacomo Marramao\", ed. by Stefano Franchi and Manuela Marchesini, Bollati Boringhieri, Torino 2017 ().\n\nStarting from the study of Italian and European Marxism (\"Marxism and Revisionism in Italy\", 1971; \"Austro-Marxism and left wing Socialism between the two Wars\", 1977), Marramao has analysed the political categories of modernity suggesting – on the same wavelength as the Frankfurt School (\"The political and its transformations\", 1979) and Max Weber (\"The disenchanted order\", 1985)– an innovative symbolic-genealogical reconstruction of them. According to this view, which recovers Karl Löwith's historical-philosophical hypothesis, in modern forms of social organizations there are settled meanings deriving from a process of secularization of religious contents – that is, the re-proposal of the Christian symbolic horizon inside a worldly dimension. In particular, secularization finds its centre in a process of \"temporalization of history\" thanks to which the categories of time (that translate Christian eschatology into a generic opening to the future: progress, revolution, liberation, etc.) gain an increasing centrality in the political representations of Modernity.\n\nBased on these reflections, also exposed in \"After the Leviathan\", 1995 (third edition in 2013) and \"The Passion of the Present\", 2008, a clear thematization of the philosophical problem of time has grown up. In opposition to Henri Bergson's and Martin Heidegger's views, which delineate with different shades a pure form of temporality, more original than its representations and spatializations, Marramao declares that the link time-space is inseparable and, also connecting to contemporary Physics, he asserts that the structure of Time possesses an aporetic and impure profile, compared to which the dimension of space is the formal reference necessary to think its paradoxes (\"Minima temporalia\", 1990, new edition in 2005; \"Kairos: Towards an Ontology of Due Time\", 1992, new edition in 2005).\n\n\n"}

Eric Schliesser, writing on NewApps, described Beebee as 'one of the most prominent metaphysicists of our time.' Beebee has a significant interest in the problem of underrepresentation of women in the field of philosophy, and has spoken about the problems that face women philosophers in a modern academic context, such as in her paper \"Women and Deviance in Philosophy\".\n\nBeebee received her bachelor's from the University of Warwick, her master's from the University of Liverpool, and her doctorate from King's College London.\n\nBeebee is currently the Samuel Hall Professor of Philosophy at the University of Manchester, a position she has held since 2012. Before her current position, Beebee held full-time appointments at the University of Manchester, and the University of Birmingham. During her time at Birmingham, she served as Head of Department, and later as Head of School. Besides for her permanent appointments, Beebee has also held temporary appointments at the University of Edinburgh, University of St. Andrews, and the University College, London, and has also held a postdoctoral position at Australian National University.\n\nA majority of Beebee's research could be broadly classed as dealing with Humeanism and related issues. She has written on a wide variety of topics related to Humeanism, including attempting to tackle the question of whether or not the laws of nature govern what happens, whether inductive scepticism follows necessary from a Humeanistic approach, and whether or not it is possible to observe causal relations in a meaningful way. She has also written on Hume himself. Beebee also has a secondary interest in free will, particularly in bringing Humean approaches to the problem of compatibilitism.\n\nBeebee is on the editorial boards of \"Hume Studies\" as well as the \"Australasian Journal of Philosophy\". She's also an associate editor of the \"British Journal for the Philosophy of Science\". She has co-authored two textbooks, written two books and numerous book chapters, and published a number of peer-reviewed papers in journals of philosophy.\n\nIn August, 2011, the \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" reported on an email sent by Beebee, then Head of School of Philosophy, Theology and Religion at Birmingham University, to staff in the School. The email urged staff to be \"VERY generous\" when assessing postgraduate applications, warning that they \"simply cannot afford to be very choosy\". Malcolm McCrae, chair of the UK Council for Graduate Education, in voicing his opinion of the email and practice at Birmingham said, \"It is well known that students whose capabilities are not on a par with the demands of the programme they are following always turn out to be much more work, accentuating the pressure to compromise academic standards in an effort to get already recruited students through to...completion,\" and added that when such students started jobs, it would \"quickly become apparent that they aren't up to the quality their qualification says they should be\".\n"}

{"id": "6284782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6284782", "title": "Hirata Atsutane", "text": "Hirata Atsutane\n\nHirata was born to a low-ranking \"samurai\" family of Akita domain (in present-day Akita Prefecture) in the Tōhoku region of northern Japan. His father was named Ōwada Yoshitane, and Hirata was adopted by Matsuyama retainer Hirata Tōbei, from whom he received the family name of Hirata in 1800. Little is known of his early life, but Hirata was a student of the Neo-Confucianism of Yamazaki Ansai (1619–1682) in Edo. He later turned towards Daoism as found in the works of the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi, and towards Shintō as per the works of Motoori Norinaga, founder of the \"kokugaku\" movement.\n\nThough he is traditionally ranked fourth in the lineage of \"kokugaku\" scholars, Hirata actually represents a break with the purely scholarly urban culture characteristic of the revival of classical nativist learning, and represents a trend toward a populist message. Hirata laid particular emphasis on reaching the average man, and adapted his own style to them by employing at times the vernacular idiom.\n\nHirata claimed later to have received the mantle of \"kokugaku\" teacher in a dream directly from Motoori Norinaga, but the story is apocryphal. Hirata's interest in \"kokugaku\" postdates Motoori's own death.\n\nHirata was a prolific writer. Representative works in the study of ancient Japanese traditions include \"Tama no mihashira\" (The True Pillar of Spirit), \"Koshi seibun\" (Treatise on Ancient History), \"Kodō taii\" (True Meaning of the Ancient Way) and \"Zoku Shintō taii\" (True Meaning of Common Shintō), and the commentaries \"Koshi-chō\" and \"Koshi-den\". He is also noted for his studies of ancient Indian and Chinese tradition (\"Indo zōshi\" and \"Morokoshi taikoden\"), and texts dealing with the spirit world, including \"Senkyō ibun\" (Strange Tales of the Land of Immortals) and \"Katsugorō saisei kibun\" (Chronicle of the Rebirth of Katsugorō). His early work \"Honkyō gaihen\" indicates an acquaintance with Christian literature that had been authored by Jesuits in China.\n\nHirata frequently expressed hostility to the Confucian and Buddhist scholars of the day, advocating instead a revival of the “ancient ways” in which the emperor was to be revered. Hirata's first published work, \"Kamosho\" (1803) was a scathing attack on the works of Confucian philosopher Dazai Shundai (1680–1747) on Buddhism, and resulted in an invitation to teach from the Yoshida family, the hereditary clan leading Yoshida Shinto.\n\nThe contents of his 1841 treatise \"Tenchō mukyūreki\" (Chronicle of the Perpetual Rule of the Emperor) angered the ruling Tokugawa bakufu government, and he was sentenced to confinement in Akita until his death in 1843.\n\nHirata's activities eventually attracted over 500 pupils, including Okuni Takamasa and Suzuki Shigetane. His nationalist writings had considerable impact on the \"samurai\" who supported the \"Sonnō jōi\" movement and who fought in the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Meiji Restoration.\n\nAtsutane's influence on kokugaku has recently been thought to be overestimated. While he is called one of the \"four great men of kokugaku\", this is a phrase he invented himself. His work more often influenced religious groups than the government in the Empire of Japan.\n\nAmong Atsutane's more enduring contributions to Japanese thought was the idea that all Japanese were descended from the gods, not only the Imperial family and certain aristocratic families. As he put it, \"this, our glorious land, is the land in which the gods have their origin, and we are one and all descendants of the gods. For this reason, if we go back from the parents who gave us life and being, beyond the grandparents and great-grandparents, and consider the ancestors of ancient times, then the original ancestors of those must necessarily have been the gods.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23918116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23918116", "title": "Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles", "text": "Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles\n\nThe historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles, the principal historical source for the Apostolic Age, is of interest for biblical scholars and historians of Early Christianity as part of the debate over the historicity of the Bible.\n\nArchaeological inscriptions and other independent sources show that Acts contains some accurate details of 1st century society with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. However, the historicity of the depiction of Paul the Apostle in Acts is contested. Acts describes Paul differently from how Paul describes himself, both factually and theologically. Acts differs with Paul's letters on important issues, such as the Law, Paul's own , and his relation to the Jerusalem church. Scholars generally prefer Paul's account over that in Acts.\n\n\"Luke–Acts\" is a two-part historical account traditionally ascribed to Luke, who was believed to be a follower of Paul. The author of \"Luke–Acts\" noted that there were many accounts in circulation at the time of his writing, saying that these were eye-witness testimonies. He stated that he had investigated \"everything from the beginning\" and was editing the material into one account from the birth of Jesus to his own time. Like other historians of his time, he defined his actions by stating that the reader can rely on the \"certainty\" of the facts given. However, most scholars understand \"Luke–Acts\" to be in the tradition of Greek historiography.\n\nIt has been claimed that the author of Acts used the writings of Josephus (specifically \"Antiquities of the Jews\") as a historical source. The majority of scholars reject both this claim and the claim that Josephus borrowed from Acts, arguing instead that Luke and Josephus drew on common traditions and historical sources.\n\nSeveral scholars have criticised the author's use of his source materials. For example, Richard Heard has written that, \"in his narrative in the early part of Acts he seems to be stringing together, as best he may, a number of different stories and narratives, some of which appear, by the time they reached him, to have been seriously distorted in the telling.\"\n\nLike most New Testament books, there are differences between the earliest surviving manuscripts of Acts. In the case of Acts, however, the differences between the surviving manuscripts are more substantial than most. Arguably the two earliest versions of manuscripts are the Western text-type (as represented by the Codex Bezae) and the Alexandrian text-type (as represented by the Codex Vaticanus and the Codex Sinaiticus which was not seen in Europe until 1859). The version of Acts preserved in the Western manuscripts contains about 6.2-8.5% more content than the Alexandrian version of Acts (depending on the definition of a variant).\n\nModern scholars consider that the shorter Alexandrian text is closer to the original, and the longer Western text is the result of later insertion of additional material into the text.\n\nA third class of manuscripts, known as the Byzantine text-type, is often considered to have developed after the Western and Alexandrian types. While differing from both of the other types, the Byzantine type has more similarity to the Alexandrian than to the Western type. The extant manuscripts of this type date from the 5th century or later; however, papyrus fragments show that this text-type may date as early as the Alexandrian or Western text-types. The Byzantine text-type served as the basis for the 16th century Textus Receptus, produced by Erasmus, the first Greek-language printed edition of the New Testament. The Textus Receptus, in turn, served as the basis for the New Testament in the English-language King James Bible. Today, the Byzantine text-type is the subject of renewed interest as the possible original form of the text from which the Western and Alexandrian text-types were derived.\n\nThe debate on the historicity of Acts became most vehement between 1895 and 1915. Ferdinand Christian Baur viewed it as unreliable, and mostly an effort to reconcile gentile and Jewish forms of Christianity. Adolf von Harnack in particular was known for being very critical of the accuracy of Acts, though his allegations of its inaccuracies have been described as \"exaggerated hypercriticism\" by some. Attitudes towards the historicity of Acts have ranged widely across scholarship in different countries.\n\nBy 2017 consensus had emerged among scholars that the letters of Paul are more reliable for information about Paul than Acts and that, according to Heidi J. Hornik and Mikeal C. Parsons, \"Acts must be carefully sifted and mined for historical information.\"\n\nActs contains some accurate details of 1st century society, specifically with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, including:\n\n\nTalbert concludes that the historical inaccuracies within Acts \"are few and insignificant compared to the overwhelming congruence of Acts and its time [until AD 64] and place [Palestine and the wider Roman Empire]\". Talbert cautions nevertheless that \"an exact description of the milieu does not prove the historicity of the event narrated\".\n\nWhilst treating its description of the history of the early church skeptically, critical scholars such as Gerd Lüdemann, Alexander Wedderburn, Hans Conzelmann, and Martin Hengel still view Acts as containing valuable historically accurate accounts of the earliest Christians.\n\nLüdemann acknowledges the historicity of Christ’s post-resurrection appearances, the names of the early disciples, women disciples, and Judas Iscariot. Wedderburn says the disciples indisputably believed Christ was truly raised. Conzelmann dismisses an alleged contradiction between and . Hengel believes Acts was written early by Luke as a partial eyewitness, praising Luke’s knowledge of Palestine, and of Jewish customs in Acts 1:12. \nWith regard to , Lüdemann is skeptical with regard to the appointment of Matthias, but not with regard to his historical existence. Wedderburn rejects the theory that denies the historicity of the disciples, Conzelmann considers the upper room meeting a historical event Luke knew from tradition, and Hengel considers ‘the Field of Blood’ to be an authentic historical name.\n\nConcerning Acts 2, Lüdemann considers the Pentecost gathering as very possible, and the apostolic instruction to be historically credible. Wedderburn acknowledges the possibility of a ‘mass ecstatic experience’, and notes it is difficult to explain why early Christians later adopted this Jewish festival if there had not been an original Pentecost event as described in Acts. He also holds the description of the early community in Acts 2 to be reliable.\n\nLüdemann views Acts 3:1–31 as historical. Wedderburn notes what he sees as features of an idealized description, but nevertheless cautions against dismissing the record as unhistorical. Hengel likewise insists that Luke described genuine historical events, even if he has idealized them.\n\nWedderburn maintains the historicity of communal ownership among the early followers of Christ (Acts 4:32–37). Conzelmann, though sceptical, believes Luke took his account of Acts 6:1–15 from a written record; more positively, Wedderburn defends the historicity of the account against scepticism. Lüdemann considers the account to have a historical basis.\n\n speaks of Peter addressing an audience, resulting in the number of Christian converts rising to 5,000 people. A Professor of the New Testament Robert M. Grant says \"Luke evidently regarded himself as a historian, but many questions can be raised in regard to the reliability of his history […] His ‘statistics’ are impossible; Peter could not have addressed three thousand hearers [e.g. in ] without a microphone, and since the population of Jerusalem was about 25–30,000, Christians cannot have numbered five thousand [e.g. Acts 4:4].\"\n\n gives an account of speech by the 1st century Pharisee Gamaliel (d. ~50ad), in which he refers to two first century movements. One of these was led by Theudas. Afterwards another was led by Judas the Galilean. Josephus placed Judas at the Census of Quirinius of the year 6 and Theudas under the procurator Fadus in 44–46. Assuming Acts refers to the same Theudas as Josephus, two problems emerge. First, the order of Judas and Theudas is reversed in Acts 5. Second, Theudas's movement may come after the time when Gamaliel is speaking. It is possible that Theudas in Josephus is not the same one as in Acts, or that it is Josephus who has his dates confused. The late 2nd-century writer Origen referred to a Theudas active before the birth of Jesus, although it is possible that this simply draws on the account in \"Acts\".\n\n speaks of a Roman Centurion called Cornelius belonging to the \"Italian regiment\" and stationed in Caesarea. Robert Grant claims that during the reign of Herod Agrippa, 41–44, no Roman troops were stationed in his territory. Wedderburn likewise finds the narrative \"historically suspect\", and in view of the lack of inscriptional and literary evidence corroborating Acts, historian de Blois suggests that the unit either did not exist or was a later unit which the author of Acts projected to an earlier time.\n\nNoting that the 'Italian regiment' is generally identified as \"cohors II Italica civium Romanorum\", a unit whose presence in Judea is attested no earlier than AD 69, historian E Mary Smallwood observes that the events described from Acts 9:32 to chapter 11 may not be in chronological order with the rest of the chapter but actually take place after Agrippa's death in chapter 12, and that the \"Italian regiment\" may have been introduced to Caesarea as early as AD 44. Wedderburn notes this suggestion of chronological re-arrangement, along with the suggestion that Cornelius lived in Caesarea away from his unit. Historians such as Bond, Speidel, and Saddington, see no difficulty in the record of Acts 10:1.\n\nThe description of the 'Apostolic Council' in , generally considered the same event described in , is considered by some scholars to be contradictory to the Galatians account. The historicity of Luke's account has been challenged, and was rejected completely by some scholars in the mid to late 20th century. However, more recent scholarship inclines towards treating the Jerusalem Council and its rulings as a historical event, though this is sometimes expressed with caution.\n\nIn , James, the leader of the Christian Jews in Jerusalem, gives a speech where he quotes scriptures from the Greek Septuagint (). Some believe this is incongruous with the portrait of James as a Jewish leader who would presumably speak Aramaic, not Greek. For instance, Richard Pervo notes: \"The scriptural citation strongly differs from the MT which has nothing to do with the inclusion of gentiles. This is the vital element in the citation and rules out the possibility that the historical James (who would not have cited the LXX) utilized the passage.\"\n\nA possible explanation is that the Septuagint translation better made James's point about the inclusion of Gentiles as the people of God. Dr. John Barnett stated that \"Many of the Jews in Jesus' day used the Septuagint as their Bible\". Although Aramaic was a major language of the Ancient Near East, by Jesus's day Greek had been the lingua franca of the area for 300 years.\n\nIn , a Roman asks Paul if he was 'the Egyptian' who led a band of 'sicarii' (literally: 'dagger-men') into the desert. In both The Jewish Wars and Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus talks about Jewish nationalist rebels called sicarii directly prior to talking about The Egyptian leading some followers to the Mount of Olives. Richard Pervo believes that this demonstrates that Luke used Josephus as a source and mistakenly thought that the sicarii were followers of The Egyptian.\n\nTwo early sources that mention the origins of Christianity are the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" by the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus, and the \"Church History\" of Eusebius. Josephus and Luke-Acts are thought to be approximately contemporaneous, around AD 90, and Eusebius wrote some two and a quarter centuries later.\n\n\n\n"}

He studied theology at the University of Halle, and became tutor to the eldest son of Baron von der Horst, to whose family he was attached for several years. In 1763 he was appointed co-rector of the school of St. Martin's, and second preacher in the hospital church of the Holy Ghost, but he soon resigned these offices and followed his patron to Berlin. There he met C. F. Nicolai and Moses Mendelssohn, with whom he formed a close friendship, and who were instrumental in his forming his own views. In 1768 he became chaplain to the workhouse at Berlin and the neighbouring fishing village of Stralow. Here he wrote his \"Neue Apologie des Socrates\" (1772), a work occasioned by an attack on the fifteenth chapter of Jean-François Marmontel's \"Belisarius\" by Peter Hofstede, a Rotterdam clergyman.\n\nIn 1774 he was appointed to the living of Charlottenburg. A second volume of his \"Apologie\" appeared in 1778. In this he tried to meet some objections to the former part, and continued his inquiries into the doctrines of the Christian religion, religious toleration, and the proper rules for interpreting the Scriptures. In 1778 he accepted the professorship of philosophy at Halle, where his students included Friedrich Schleiermacher and the Serbian writer Dositej Obradović. In 1786 he was admitted as a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences; in 1805 the King of Prussia conferred upon him the honorary title of privy-councillor. In 1808 he obtained the degree of Doctor in Divinity, which was awarded for his theological writings. He died in Berlin in 1809.\n\nHe was a master of the learned languages, spoke and wrote French fluently, and understood English, Italian and Dutch.\n\nEberhard argued in books such as \"Neue Apologie des Socrates\" that salvation did not depend upon revelation, that it was possible for a to go to heaven, and that the notion of eternal punishment contradicted its supposed aim of morally improving the sinner.\n\nEberhard argued in support of John Locke's position that all knowledge comes through the senses, but developed this into a full-blooded phenomenalism. In aesthetics he held a position that he called \"subjective finalism\", a label later adopted by Immanuel Kant: rather than being an objective property of objects, beauty is the relationship between the object and the representative power of the observer. For him, then, art should aim to awake and stimulate the pleasurable passions. According to Eberhard, aesthetic activity first appears in children's play.\n\nIn his position as editor of the \"Philosophisches Magazin\" (1788–1792) and the \"Philosophisches Archiv\" (1792–1795), Eberhard published many articles (most of which he wrote himself) critical of Kant. He argued that Kant's work was wholly derivative, simply adopting the work of Gottfried Leibniz, and a variety of dogmatism. Kant responded to Eberhard's criticism in his \"Ueber eine Entdeckung, nach der alle neue Kritik der reinen Vernunft durch eine ältere entbehrlich gemacht werden soll\" (Königsberg, 1790).\n\n\n"}

After finishing the classical lyceum in Gorizia and the Theresianum in Vienna, he enrolled in the University of Vienna, where he studied law. After graduation in 1908, he worked in the local branches of the state administration in Carniola, and later in the ministerial offices in Vienna. In 1915, he obtained habilitation in Austrian civil law, and in 1917 in philosophy of law. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he became a member of the administrative commission of the National Government of the short-lived State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.\n\nIn 1919, he served as a legal expert in the Yugoslav delegation at the Versailles Peace Conference. The same year, he was named professor at the newly formed University of Ljubljana. In September 1920, he was named as Secretary for Internal Affairs in the Regional Government for Slovenia. In December of the same year, he became the last president of the regional government before its dissolution. In the 1920s, he worked as the Yugoslav deputy delegate at the League of Nations, and between 1929 and 1935 as the ambassador of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to the United States.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1927, he served as chancellor of the University of Ljubljana. After his return from the United States in 1935, he resumed teaching at the universities of Ljubljana and Zagreb. In the academic year 1940/41 was elected dean of the Faculty of Law and remained there as a professor until June 1952, when he finally retired.\n\nIn 1928, he became a member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts and in 1938 of the Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana (later renamed the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts). In 1948 the Communist regime expelled him from the academy. His academy membership was reinstated after his death in 1971 and it was unofficially reinstated after 1988 and officially in 1996.\n\nHe died in Ljubljana and was buried in Žale cemetery.\n\nPitamic published several treatises on philosophy of law. He was the follower of the theories of legal positivism established by Hans Kelsen. His most important work is the volume \"Država\" (The State), published in 1927 and translated into English in 1933 under the title \"A Treatise on the State\".\n\n"}

In his later work, Kolakowski increasingly focused on religious questions. In his 1986 Jefferson Lecture, he asserted that \"We learn history not in order to know how to behave or how to succeed, but to know who we are.\"\n\nDue to his criticism of Marxism and Communism, Kołakowski was effectively exiled from Poland in 1968. He spent most of the remainder of his career at All Souls College, Oxford. Despite this exile, Kołakowski was a major inspiration for the Solidarity movement that flourished in Poland in the 1980s and helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to his being described as the \"awakener of human hopes\".\n\nKołakowski was born in Radom, Poland. He did not enjoy formal schooling during the German occupation of Poland (1939–1945) in World War II, but did read books and took occasional private lessons, passing his school-leaving examinations as an external student in the underground school system. After the war he studied philosophy at Łódź University. By the late 1940s it was obvious that he was one of the most brilliant Polish minds of his generation, and in 1953 earned a doctorate from Warsaw University with a thesis on Baruch Spinoza in which he viewed Spinoza from a Marxist point of view. He served as a professor and chairman of Warsaw University's department of the history of philosophy from 1959 to 1968.\n\nIn his youth Kołakowski became a communist. In the period 1947 to 1966 he was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party. His intellectual promise earned him a trip to Moscow in 1950, where he saw communism in practice and found it repulsive. He broke with Stalinism, becoming a \"revisionist Marxist\" advocating a humanist interpretation of Marx. One year after the 1956 Polish October, Kołakowski published a four-part critique of Soviet-Marxist dogmas, including historical determinism, in the Polish periodical \"Nowa Kultura\". His public lecture at Warsaw University on the tenth anniversary of Polish October led to his expulsion from the Polish United Workers' Party. In the course of the 1968 Polish political crisis he lost his job at Warsaw University and was prevented from obtaining any other academic post.\n\nHe came to the conclusion that the totalitarian cruelty of Stalinism was not an aberration, but instead a logical end-product of Marxism, whose genealogy he examined in his monumental \"Main Currents of Marxism\", his major work, published in 1976–1978.\n\nKolakowski became increasingly fascinated by the contribution which theological assumptions make to Western, and, in particular, modern thought. For example, he begins his \"Main Currents of Marxism\" with an analysis of the contribution that various forms of mediaeval Platonism made, centuries later, to the Hegelian view of history. In this work he criticized the laws of dialectical materialism for being fundamentally flawed— finding some of them being \"truisms with no specific Marxist content\", others \"philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means\", yet others being just \"nonsense\".\n\nKołakowski defended the role which freedom plays in the human quest for the transcendent.\n\nHis \"Law of the Infinite Cornucopia\" asserts a doctrine of status quaestionis - that for any given doctrine one wants to believe, there is never a shortage of arguments by which one can support it. Nevertheless, although human fallibility implies that we ought to treat claims to infallibility with scepticism, our pursuit of the higher (such as truth and goodness) is ennobling.\n\nIn 1968 Kołakowski became a visiting professor in the department of philosophy at McGill University in Montreal and in 1969 he moved to the University of California, Berkeley. In 1970 he became a senior research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He remained mostly at Oxford, although he spent part of 1974 at Yale University, and from 1981 to 1994 was a part-time professor at the Committee on Social Thought and in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago.\n\nAlthough the Polish Communist authorities officially banned his works in Poland, underground copies of them influenced the opinions of the Polish intellectual opposition. His 1971 essay \"Theses on Hope and Hopelessness\" (full title : \"In Stalin's Countries: Theses on Hope and Despair\"), which suggested that self-organized social groups could gradually expand the spheres of civil society in a totalitarian state, helped to inspire the dissident movements of the 1970s that led to Solidarity and, eventually, to the collapse of Communist rule in Europe in 1989. In the 1980s, Kołakowski supported Solidarity by giving interviews, writing and fund-raising.\n\nIn Poland, Kołakowski is not only revered as a philosopher and historian of ideas, but also as an icon for opponents of communism. Adam Michnik has called Kołakowski \"one of the most prominent creators of contemporary Polish culture\".\n\nKołakowski died on 17 July 2009, aged 81, in Oxford, England. In his obituary, philosopher Roger Scruton said Kolakowski was a \"thinker for our time\" and that regarding Kolakowski's debates with intellectual opponents, \"even if ... nothing remained of the subversive orthodoxies, nobody felt damaged in their ego or defeated in their life's project, by arguments which from any other source would have inspired the greatest indignation.\"\n\nIn 1986, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Kołakowski for the Jefferson Lecture. Kołakowski's lecture \"The Idolatry of Politics\", was reprinted in his collection of essays \"Modernity on Endless Trial\".\n\nIn 2003, the Library of Congress named Kołakowski the first winner of the John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Humanities.\n\nHis other awards include the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

There he studied philosophy with Henri Bergson, who had a big influence on his thought. He aggregated in Philosophy in 1901. He taught at various \"lycées\" before traveling to Germany in 1904, where he studied at the University of Göttingen and worked on cataloging Leibniz's papers. He was nominated to co-edit an edition of Leibniz's work which never came to fruition.\n\nHe returned to France in 1905 and met Émile Durkheim, who sparked his interest in sociology. He soon joined the editorial board of \"L'Année Sociologique\", where he worked with François Simiand editing the Economics and Statistics sections. In 1909 he returned to Germany to study Marxism and economics in Berlin.\n\nHe also had a son, Pierre Halbwachs, who influenced Deleuze in the 1940s.\n\nFrom Deleuze ABCedaire : \n\"Deleuze says that it was there in Deauville, without his parents and his younger brother, where he was completely nil in his studies, until something happened, such that Deleuze ceased being an idiot. Until Deauville, and the year in the lycee there that he spent during the \"funny war,\" he had been null in class, but at Deauville, he met a young teacher, Pierre Halbwachs (son of a famous sociologist), with fragile health, only one eye, so deferred from military duty. For Deleuze, this encounter was an awakening, and he became something of a disciple to this young \"maître\". Halbwachs would take him out to the beach in winter, on the dunes, and introduced him, for example, to Gide's _Les Nourritures terrestres_, to Anatole France, Baudelaire, other works by Gide, and Deleuze was completely transformed. But since they spent so much time together, people began to talk, and the lady in whose pension Deleuze and his brother were staying warned Deleuze about Halbwachs, then wrote to his parents about it. The brothers were to return to Paris, but then the Germans invaded, and so they took off on their bicycles to meet their parents in Rochefort... and en route, they ran into Halbwachs with his father! Later in life, Deleuze met Halbwachs, without the same admiration, but at age 14, Deleuze feels he was completely right.\"\n\nThroughout World War I, Halbwachs worked at the War Ministry. Shortly after the end of the war, he became professor of sociology and pedagogy at the University of Strasbourg. He remained in this position for over a decade, taking leave for a year as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago, when he was called to the Sorbonne in 1935. There he taught sociology and worked closely with Marcel Mauss and served as the editor of \"Annales de Sociologie\", the successor journal to \"L'Année Sociologique\". In 1944 he received one of France's highest honors, a chair at the Collège de France in Social Psychology.\n\nA longtime socialist, Halbwachs was detained by the Gestapo after protesting the arrest of his Jewish father-in-law. He was deported to Buchenwald, where he died of dysentery in 1945.\n\nPart of his books were offered by his widow to the library of the \"Centre d'études sociologiques\" and are now held at the Human and Social Sciences Library Paris Descartes-CNRS.\n\nHalbwachs' most important contribution to the field of sociology came in his book \"La Mémoire collective\", 1950 (\"The Collective Memory\"), in which he advanced the thesis that a society can have a collective memory and that this memory is dependent upon the \"cadre\" or framework within which a group is situated in a society. Thus, there is not only an individual memory, but also a group memory that exists outside of and lives beyond the individual. Consequently, an individual's understanding of the past is strongly linked to this group consciousness.\n\nHalbwachs also wrote an important book on suicide, \"Les Causes du suicide\", 1930 (\"The Causes of Suicide\"). In this book he followed the footsteps of his mentor Émile Durkheim, expanding and elaborating upon the former's theories on suicide.\n\n\n"}

He was a professor at the University of Ljubljana, a member of the Slovene Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the founder of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

{"id": "21210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21210", "title": "Niels Bohr", "text": "Niels Bohr\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr (; 7 October 1885 – 18 November 1962) was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.\n\nBohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.\n\nBohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element bohrium was named after him.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from Nazism. After Denmark was occupied by the Germans, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the German nuclear weapon project. In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.\n\nBohr was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 7 October 1885, the second of three children of Christian Bohr, a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen, and Ellen Adler Bohr, who came from a wealthy Danish Jewish family prominent in banking and parliamentary circles. He had an elder sister, Jenny, and a younger brother Harald. Jenny became a teacher, while Harald became a mathematician and Olympic footballer who played for the Danish national team at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. Bohr was a passionate footballer as well, and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen-based Akademisk Boldklub (Academic Football Club), with Bohr as goalkeeper.\nBohr was educated at Gammelholm Latin School, starting when he was seven. In 1903, Bohr enrolled as an undergraduate at Copenhagen University. His major was physics, which he studied under Professor Christian Christiansen, the university's only professor of physics at that time. He also studied astronomy and mathematics under Professor Thorvald Thiele, and philosophy under Professor Harald Høffding, a friend of his father.\n\nIn 1905, a gold medal competition was sponsored by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\".\n\nHarald became the first of the two Bohr brothers to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a thesis on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger Doctor of Philosophy (dr. phil.) thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's thesis that is today known as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem.\nIn 1910, Bohr met Margrethe Nørlund, the sister of the mathematician Niels Erik Nørlund. Bohr resigned his membership in the Church of Denmark on 16 April 1912, and he and Margrethe were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall in Slagelse on 1 August. Years later, his brother Harald similarly left the church before getting married. Bohr and Margrethe had six sons. The oldest, Christian, died in a boating accident in 1934, and another, Harald, died from childhood meningitis. Aage Bohr became a successful physicist, and in 1975 was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, like his father. became a physician; , a chemical engineer; and Ernest, a lawyer. Like his uncle Harald, Ernest Bohr became an Olympic athlete, playing field hockey for Denmark at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nIn September 1911, Bohr, supported by a fellowship from the Carlsberg Foundation, travelled to England. At the time, it was where most of the theoretical work on the structure of atoms and molecules was being done. He met J. J. Thomson of the Cavendish Laboratory and Trinity College, Cambridge. He attended lectures on electromagnetism given by James Jeans and Joseph Larmor, and did some research on cathode rays, but failed to impress Thomson. He had more success with younger physicists like the Australian William Lawrence Bragg, and New Zealand's Ernest Rutherford, whose 1911 Rutherford model of the atom had challenged Thomson's 1904 plum pudding model. Bohr received an invitation from Rutherford to conduct post-doctoral work at Victoria University of Manchester, where Bohr met George de Hevesy and Charles Galton Darwin (whom Bohr referred to as \"the grandson of the real Darwin\").\n\nBohr returned to Denmark in July 1912 for his wedding, and travelled around England and Scotland on his honeymoon. On his return, he became a \"privatdocent\" at the University of Copenhagen, giving lectures on thermodynamics. Martin Knudsen put Bohr's name forward for a \"docent\", which was approved in July 1913, and Bohr then began teaching medical students. His three papers, which later became famous as \"the trilogy\", were published in \"Philosophical Magazine\" in July, September and November of that year. He adapted Rutherford's nuclear structure to Max Planck's quantum theory and so created his Bohr model of the atom.\n\nPlanetary models of atoms were not new, but Bohr's treatment was. Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin on the role of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.\n\nIn 1885, Johann Balmer had come up with his Balmer series to describe the visible spectral lines of a hydrogen atom:\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the absorbed or emitted light and \"R\" is the Rydberg constant. Balmer's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines, but for thirty years, no one could explain why it worked. In the first paper of his trilogy, Bohr was able to derive it from his model:\nwhere \"m\" is the electron's mass, \"e\" is its charge, \"h\" is Planck's constant and \"Z\" is the atom's atomic number (1 for hydrogen).\n\nThe model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines which did not fit Balmer's formula. When challenged on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, did not like the trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.\n\nBohr did not enjoy teaching medical students. He decided to return to Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a reader in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohr's subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King Christian X, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.\n\nIn April 1917, Bohr began a campaign to establish an Institute of Theoretical Physics. He gained the support of the Danish government and the Carlsberg Foundation, and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors, many of them Jewish. Legislation establishing the Institute was passed in November 1918. Now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, it opened on 3 March 1921, with Bohr as its director. His family moved into an apartment on the first floor. Bohr's institute served as a focal point for researchers into quantum mechanics and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s, when most of the world's best known theoretical physicists spent some time in his company. Early arrivals included Hans Kramers from the Netherlands, Oskar Klein from Sweden, George de Hevesy from Hungary, Wojciech Rubinowicz from Poland and Svein Rosseland from Norway. Bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague. Klein and Rosseland produced the Institute's first publication even before it opened.\nThe Bohr model worked well for hydrogen, but could not explain more complex elements. By 1919, Bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus and developed heuristics to describe them. The rare-earth elements posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar. An important development came in 1924 with Wolfgang Pauli's discovery of the Pauli exclusion principle, which put Bohr's models on a firm theoretical footing. Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of zirconium. He was immediately challenged by the French chemist Georges Urbain, who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called \"celtium\". At the Institute in Copenhagen, Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong. Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. They went through samples from Copenhagen's Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. The element, which they named hafnium (\"Hafnia\" being the Latin name for Copenhagen) turned out to be more common than gold.\n\nIn 1922, Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them\". The award thus recognised both the Trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics. For his Nobel lecture, Bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the correspondence principle, which he had formulated. This states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers.\n\nThe discovery of Compton scattering by Arthur Holly Compton in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of photons, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and John C. Slater, an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory (BKS). It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.\n\nModelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using \"virtual oscillators\" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They led to the development of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that \"there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible\".\n\nThe introduction of spin by George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit in November 1925 was a milestone. The next month, Bohr travelled to Leiden to attend celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Hendrick Lorentz receiving his doctorate. When his train stopped in Hamburg, he was met by Wolfgang Pauli and Otto Stern, who asked for his opinion of the spin theory. Bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields. When he arrived in Leiden, Paul Ehrenfest and Albert Einstein informed Bohr that Einstein had resolved this problem using relativity. Bohr then had Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit incorporate this into their paper. Thus, when he met Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan in Göttingen on the way back, he had become, in his own words, \"a prophet of the electron magnet gospel\".\n\nHeisenberg first came to Copenhagen in 1924, then returned to Göttingen in June 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. When he showed his results to Max Born in Göttingen, Born realised that they could best be expressed using matrices. This work attracted the attention of the British physicist Paul Dirac, who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926. Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger also visited in 1926. His attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed Bohr, who believed it contributed \"so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics\".\n\nWhen Kramers left the Institute in 1926 to take up a chair as professor of theoretical physics at the Utrecht University, Bohr arranged for Heisenberg to return and take Kramers's place as a \"lektor\" at the University of Copenhagen. Heisenberg worked in Copenhagen as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr from 1926 to 1927.\n\nBohr became convinced that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He felt that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers.\n\nIn Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle, which Bohr embraced. In a paper he presented at the Volta Conference at Como in September 1927, he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had good-natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives.\n\nIn 1914, Carl Jacobsen, the heir to Carlsberg breweries, bequeathed his mansion to be used for life by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts, as an honorary residence (). Harald Høffding had been the first occupant, and upon his death in July 1931, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters gave Bohr occupancy. He and his family moved there in 1932. He was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 1939.\n\nBy 1929, the phenomenon of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.\n\nThe discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek, Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that \"I have understood everything.\" Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on \"The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission\".\n\nBohr read the 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\" that Bohr was influenced by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's \"Stages on Life's Way\" as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, \"It is the only thing I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better ... I even think it is one of the most delightful things I have ever read.\" Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.\n\nThere has been some dispute over the extent to which Kierkegaard influenced Bohr's philosophy and science. David Favrholdt argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value, while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.\n\nThe rise of Nazism in Germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries, either because they were Jewish or because they were political opponents of the Nazi regime. In 1933, the Rockefeller Foundation created a fund to help support refugee academics, and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, Max Mason, in May 1933 during a visit to the United States. Bohr offered the refugees temporary jobs at the Institute, provided them with financial support, arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, and ultimately found them places at institutions around the world. Those that he helped included Guido Beck, Felix Bloch, James Franck, George de Hevesy, Otto Frisch, Hilde Levi, Lise Meitner, George Placzek, Eugene Rabinowitch, Stefan Rozental, Erich Ernst Schneider, Edward Teller, Arthur von Hippel and Victor Weisskopf.\n\nIn April 1940, early in the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Denmark. To prevent the Germans from discovering Max von Laue's and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia. In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.\n\nBohr was aware of the possibility of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.\nAccording to Heisenberg, he began to address nuclear energy, morality and the war, to which Bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving Heisenberg hints about his own opinions. Ivan Supek, one of Heisenberg's students and friends, claimed that the main subject of the meeting was Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who had proposed trying to persuade Bohr to mediate peace between Britain and Germany.\n\nIn 1957, Heisenberg wrote to Robert Jungk, who was then working on the book \"\". Heisenberg explained that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists, that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts, and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world's scientists on both sides. When Bohr saw Jungk's depiction in the Danish translation of the book, he drafted (but never sent) a letter to Heisenberg, stating that he never understood the purpose of Heisenberg's visit, was shocked by Heisenberg's opinion that Germany would win the war, and that atomic weapons could be decisive.\n\nMichael Frayn's 1998 play \"Copenhagen\" explores what might have happened at the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr. A BBC television film version of the play was first screened on 26 September 2002, with Stephen Rea as Bohr, and Daniel Craig as Heisenberg. The same meeting had previously been dramatised by the BBC's \"Horizon\" science documentary series in 1992, with Anthony Bate as Bohr, and Philip Anthony as Heisenberg. The meeting is also dramatized in the Norwegian/Danish/British miniseries \"The Heavy Water War\".\n\nIn September 1943, word reached Bohr and his brother Harald that the Nazis considered their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, and that they were therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.\nWhen the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram to Bohr asking him to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay. During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.\n\nBohr was warmly received by James Chadwick and Sir John Anderson, but for security reasons Bohr was kept out of sight. He was given an apartment at St James's Palace and an office with the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons development team. Bohr was astonished at the amount of progress that had been made. Chadwick arranged for Bohr to visit the United States as a Tube Alloys consultant, with Aage as his assistant. On 8 December 1943, Bohr arrived in Washington, D.C., where he met with the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. He visited Einstein and Pauli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and went to Los Alamos in New Mexico, where the nuclear weapons were being designed. For security reasons, he went under the name of \"Nicholas Baker\" in the United States, while Aage became \"James Baker\". In May 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper De frie Danske reported that they had learned that 'the famous son of Denmark Professor Niels Bohr' in October the previous year had fled his country via Sweden to London and from there travelled to Moscow from where he could be assumed to support the war effort.\n\nBohr did not remain at Los Alamos, but paid a series of extended visits over the course of the next two years. Robert Oppenheimer credited Bohr with acting \"as a scientific father figure to the younger men\", most notably Richard Feynman. Bohr is quoted as saying, \"They didn't need my help in making the atom bomb.\" Oppenheimer gave Bohr credit for an important contribution to the work on modulated neutron initiators. \"This device remained a stubborn puzzle,\" Oppenheimer noted, \"but in early February 1945 Niels Bohr clarified what had to be done.\"\n\nBohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations. In April 1944, he received a letter from Peter Kapitza, written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the Soviet Union. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting. Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that \"we did not speak the same language\". Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: \"It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes.\"\n\nOppenheimer suggested that Bohr visit President Franklin D. Roosevelt to convince him that the Manhattan Project should be shared with the Soviets in the hope of speeding up its results. Bohr's friend, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, informed President Roosevelt about Bohr's opinions, and a meeting between them took place on 26 August 1944. Roosevelt suggested that Bohr return to the United Kingdom to try to win British approval. When Churchill and Roosevelt met at Hyde Park on 19 September 1944, they rejected the idea of informing the world about the project, and the aide-mémoire of their conversation contained a rider that \"enquiries should be made regarding the activities of Professor Bohr and steps taken to ensure that he is responsible for no leakage of information, particularly to the Russians\".\n\nIn June 1950, Bohr addressed an \"Open Letter\" to the United Nations calling for international cooperation on nuclear energy. In the 1950s, after the Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon test, the International Atomic Energy Agency was created along the lines of Bohr's suggestion. In 1957 he received the first ever Atoms for Peace Award.\n\nWith the war now ended, Bohr returned to Copenhagen on 25 August 1945, and was re-elected President of the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences on 21 September. At a memorial meeting of the Academy on 17 October 1947 for King Christian X, who had died in April, the new king, Frederick IX, announced that he was conferring the Order of the Elephant on Bohr. This award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state, but the king said that it honoured not just Bohr personally, but Danish science. Bohr designed his own coat of arms which featured a taijitu (symbol of yin and yang) and a motto in , \"opposites are complementary\".\n\nThe Second World War demonstrated that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a brain drain to the United States, twelve European countries banded together to create CERN, a research organisation along the lines of the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake Big Science projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. Pierre Auger, who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and Geneva was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957. Victor Weisskopf, who later became the Director General of CERN, summed up Bohr's role, saying that \"there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of CERN. The enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Scandinavian countries formed the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957, with Bohr as its chairman. He was also involved with the founding of the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission, and served as its first chairman from February 1956.\n\nBohr died of heart failure at his home in Carlsberg on 18 November 1962. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there. On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.\n\nBohr received numerous honours and accolades. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received the Hughes Medal in 1921, the Matteucci Medal in 1923, the Franklin Medal in 1926, the Copley Medal in 1938, the Order of the Elephant in 1947, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1957 and the Sonning Prize in 1961. He became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1923, and of the Royal Society in 1926. The Bohr model's semicentennial was commemorated in Denmark on 21 November 1963 with a postage stamp depicting Bohr, the hydrogen atom and the formula for the difference of any two hydrogen energy levels: formula_3. Several other countries have also issued postage stamps depicting Bohr. In 1997, the Danish National Bank began circulating the 500-krone banknote with the portrait of Bohr smoking a pipe. An asteroid, 3948 Bohr, was named after him, as was the Bohr lunar crater and bohrium, the chemical element with atomic number 107.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33836248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33836248", "title": "Nietzsche and Asian Thought", "text": "Nietzsche and Asian Thought\n\nNietzsche and Asian Thought is an anthology of essays by a variety of contributors on the relationship of the thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to Asian philosophy; specifically, Indian, Chinese and Japanese philosophy. The book was edited by American philosopher Graham Parkes and was released in 1991 by the University of Chicago Press. The work was written for a Western audience of Nietzsche scholars and comparative philosophers, but features contributions from non-Western thinkers.\n\nThe work is split into four sections—Others, India, China and Japan—and each section contains between three and four essays, for a total of 14 articles by 13 different authors. The work was well received by academic reviewers upon its release, and praised as a \"must-read\" for both Nietzsche scholars and comparative philosophers. In 2004, a special edition of \"The Journal of Nietzsche Studies\" was published, aiming to build upon the scholarship in \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\".\n\nThe essays contained in \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" were collected to illustrate both the influence that Asian (specifically, Indian) philosophy had on Nietzsche, and the influence that Nietzsche's thought subsequently had on Asian schools (in particular, Chinese and Japanese philosophy). Despite the fact that published scholarship on Nietzsche had increased in the years preceding the appearance of the book, very little had been written on the relationship between Nietzsche's philosophy and Asian philosophy. Further, only a very small portion of works written in Western languages on Nietzsche had addressed the response his works had provoked in Asia, especially Japan, after his death. \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" was \"intended as an initial contribution towards redressing [the] imbalance\", and all but two of the essays in the anthology were written specifically for it.\n\nParkes wrote that the genre of the anthology is an appropriate one in which to write about Nietzsche, claiming that he is \"above all a writer in many voices, and one problem with books written about his work is that they have been mainly 'monological,' with the author speaking in only one voice.\" He argues that justice is more likely to be done to Nietzsche's work when a multiplicity of perspectives is possible, and that \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" takes this idea further, with the inclusion of thinkers from East Asia as well as Europe. However, the work does not seek to recast Nietzsche as some kind of multicultural thinker, but instead serves to \"complicate\" our understanding of Nietzsche. One \"significant absence\" from the work is the work of Nishitani Keiji, a Japanese philosopher who lists Nietzsche as a major influence. Originally, \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" had been intended to contain a translation of an essay by Nishitani, first published in the 1930s, comparing Nietzsche's Zarathustra to Meister Eckhart, but considerations of time and space prevented this.\n\nThe work is targeted primarily at a Western audience and is written in English, with a number of essays translated from other languages. However, despite Parkes's efforts to make the anthology accessible, it can be difficult and dense in places, with heavy use of foreign terminology and enough names to \"daunt the uninitiated\". The inclusion of Asian perspectives enables Western scholars of Nietzsche to see new aspects of his thought, and the work is written to be of interest primarily to scholars of Nietzsche, but also those of comparative philosophy generally.\n\nThe work contains 14 essays, split into four sections, covering Nietzsche's relationship to Asia and \"others\" (three essays, including Parke's introductory essay), Nietzsche and India (four essays), Nietzsche and China (three essays), and Nietzsche and Japan (four essays).\n\n\"The orientation of the Nietzschean text\" is an essay by Parkes that serves as an introduction to \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\". In addition to introducing the work and summarising the other essays, Parkes discusses the extent of Nietzschean scholarship in Asia both following Nietzsche's collapse, and at the time of \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publication. He also considers the implications of Nietzsche's use of a travel metaphor in \"Human, All Too Human\", concluding that responses from foreign interpreters may serve to \"open us to hitherto concealed aspects of the corpus.\"\n\n\"The other Nietzsche\" was written by Joan Stambaugh. The essay addresses a specific aspect of Nietzsche, which Stambaugh calls the \"other\" Nietzsche; specifically, the idea of \"Nietzsche the poet mystic\". However, apart from an indirect reference to Dōgen, the essay itself does not explicitly compare Nietzsche and Asian thought; instead, it selects \"some strains of Nietzsche's thought that are most consonant with an Eastern temper of experience\", allowing readers to reach their own conclusions. Instead, Stambaugh closely considers four sections of \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\"; \"Before Sunrise\" (part 3, section 4), \"On the Great Longing\" (part 3, section 14), \"At Noon\" (part 4, section 10) and \"The Drunken Song\" (part 4, section 19). The experiences of Zarathustra in these passages can be compared to the mystical experiences of Dōgen and Meister Eckhart.\n\n\"Questioning one's \"own\" from the perspective of the foreign\" is a hermeneutic essay by Eberhard Scheiffele, translated by Graham Parkes. Scheiffele argues that the concept of the \"foreign\" is essential to Nietzsche's perspectivism, and that Nietzsche uses foreign perspectives to render odd that which is his own. He then goes on to develop four levels at which Nietzsche uses the foreign to criticise his own, the strongest of which is that European culture can be shown to be strange when seen from the perspective of \"foreign\" Asian cultures. However, for Scheiffele, although Nietzsche ranks the foreign as higher, he is concerned primarily with the criticism of his own from the perspective of the foreign. Nietzsche's heavy use of optical metaphors encourages the reader to deliberately and consciously step outside of their own tradition, allowing them to view it from multiple angles that would otherwise have been impossible. This allows them to develop the most potent form of \"seeing\"; that is, a \"simultaneous seeing\" in which an individual is simultaneously able to see their tradition from both within the tradition and from outside it.\n\n\"Nietzsche's early encounters with Asian thought\" is an essay by Johann Figl, translated by Graham Parkes. Based on studies of both Nietzsche's published and unpublished notes, Figl recounts Nietzsche's encounters with Asian thought while at Pforta, and during his first year of study at the University of Bonn. Figl concludes that Nietzsche was exposed to a considerable amount of Indian thought, despite the fact that his published notes from this period make little mention of it.\n\n\"Nietzsche and the suffering of the Indian ascetic\" is an essay by Michel Hulin, translated by Graham Parkes. Hulin examines Nietzsche's relationship with the idea of Indian asceticism and his apparently contradictory views of the practice. Despite certain strong interpretations, Hulin argues, Nietzsche is wrong about many aspects of India, but appears to value Hindu asceticism, and respect the Brahmins, for a number of reasons. Hulin argues that Nietzsche has a very particular view of Buddhism that is filled with errors, seeing it as an individualist reaction to Brahmanism, and that he compares this \"Buddhism\" to Christianity. The essay closes with a consideration of Nietzsche's praise for Buddhism's rejection of the metaphysical, but his condemnation for its weakening of the will.\n\n\"Nietzsche's trans-European eye\" is an essay by Mervyn Sprung. Challenging the traditional assumption that Nietzsche was well acquainted with Indian thought, Sprung argues that while there is some evidence of it in Nietzsche's work, Nietzsche in fact had very little interest in Indian philosophy in its own right. Sprung claims that the most compelling evidence for this is the fact that he apparently never wrote to his friend Paul Deussen asking about Indian philosophy. In this regard, Sprung may be seen as supporting Scheiffele's thesis with regards to the importance of the foreign in Nietzsche's work.\n\n\"Deconstruction and breakthrough in Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna\" is an essay by Glen T. Martin. Martin compares the philosophy of Nietzsche to the philosophy of Nāgārjuna, aiming to illuminate the relationship between their respective attempts to develop \"spiritual break-throughs\", by considering each thinker in turn. First he looks at Nietzsche's distinct rejection of traditional values, and, subsequently, considers Nietzsche's answer to the problem. Second, Martin looks to Nāgārjuna, tracing his line of thought to the \"emptiness\" and \"ultimate truth\", and then to his conception of \"liberation\". Martin then compares Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna's thought directly, with reference to Nishitani, and concludes that Nietzsche's articulation of nihilism means that the \"emptiness\" spoken of by Nāgārjuna is something that can now be seen by a great many people.\n\n\"Zhuang Zi and Nietzsche: plays of perspectives\" is an essay by Chen Guying, translated by James D. Sellmann, comparing the respective philosophies of Nietzsche and Zhuangzi. Guying discusses a number of aspects in his essay, considering the philosophers' conceptions of emotions, dreams, escapism, physicality, spiritual freedom and relativism, as well as the world in which they lived and their engagement with it. He concludes the essay by listing nine similarities between the two, as well as five major differences, closing the essay with four criticisms. The piece is a modification of an excerpt from Guying's \"Beiju Zhexuejia Nicai\" (\"The Tragic Philosopher Nietzsche\"), and is, according to Parkes, \"exemplary of modern Chinese scholarship on Nietzsche\".\n\n\"\"Nietzsche's 'will to power' and Chinese 'virtuality' (\"de\")\" is a comparative essay by Roger T. Ames, considering the relationship between Nietzsche's will to power and the notion of \"de\" in Chinese philosophy. Ames attempts to reconstruct the disparate notions of \"de\" into a single \"classical Chinese notion\" by drawing out the cosmological and aesthetic principles underlying the ethical notion of \"de\" in Confucianism, and the ethical and social implications of the primarily cosmological \"de\" in Daoism. He interprets Nietzsche's will to power as \"an alternative to mechanistic physics\", an undogmatic cosmology; the term \"cosmology\" must be redefined if applied to Nietzsche. For Ames, Nietzsche's notion of \"power\" is the separating factor between Nietzsche's \"aesthetic perspectivism\" from an \"anything-goes relativism\". Having outlined his understanding of the two notions, Ames goes on to compare \"de\" with the will to power, concluding that there is \"some common ground in the notion of overcoming ego-self\", but that there remain significant differences; for instance, while \"de\" celebrates \"enjoyment\", Nietzsche's Übermensch strives for personal joy.\n\n\"Nietzsche and the Chinese mind\" is an essay by David A. Kelly. After explaining that a nihilism similar to that found in Nietzsche's Europe can be found in China, Kelly outlines the influence Nietzsche's thought had upon Lu Xun, one of the first Chinese thinkers to consider Nietzsche, and Li Shicen, whom he describes as the \"most explicit of Chinese 'Nietzscheans'\". Kelly then recounts the view of Nietzsche, and history of Nietzsche scholarship, in China as a whole throughout the twentieth century, concluding that at different times and by different groups, Nietzsche was both admired and despised.\n\n\"The early reception of Nietzsche's philosophy in Japan\" is an essay by Graham Parkes.\n\n\"Nietzsche's conception of nature from an east-Asian point of view\" is an essay by Ōkōchi Ryōgi.\n\n\"The problem of the body in Nietzsche and Dōgen\" is an essay by Arifuku Kōgaku.\n\n\"The eloquent silence of Zarathustra\" is an essay by Sonoda Muneto.\n\nAlexander Reynolds, whose review of \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" appeared in the \"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies\", considers the task of a philosophical dialogue between East and West to be one of great importance, but felt that the work offered little to contribute to this goal. For him, Sprung's piece reveals the lack of interest Nietzsche truly had in Asia, while Nietzsche's reception in Asia can only really be spoken of in Japan, which can be accounted for by Japan's westernization more so than anything else. Reynolds also sees philosophical and philological problems with attempts to offer comparisons between Nietzsche and certain Asian figures. He concludes that, if Nietzsche was to play any part in the covergence of eastern and western philosophy, \"it will not be by grace of our elaborating desperately and incredibly on his sporadic Orientalist velleities\".\n\nKathleen Marie Higgins sees \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" as filling a gap in Nietzsche scholarship. She praises the plurality of contributors, despite the fact that the work was prepared primarily for a Western audience, and is also complimentary of the way in which \"the volume's comparative essays attempt to do justice to the dissimilarities of both context and concept in cases where Nietzsche's ideas appear prima facie to resemble those of particular Eastern thinkers\", thus rendering \"more striking the real similarities between Nietzsche's thought and Asian ideas.\" She criticises the absence of an essay on Nietzsche's reception in India, but conceded that it was perhaps not comparable to his reception in China or Japan. She concludes by saying that \"As a work in comparative philosophy, Nietzsche and Asian Thought is exemplary. Its comparative approach is incisive yet accessible. I consider it a 'must read' for English-speaking Nietzsche scholars and comparativists alike.\"\n\n\"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" represents a significant contribution to the scholarship on Nietzsche's relationship with Asian philosophy, and subsequent works that failed to take account of its scholarship have received criticism on that score. However, since the time of its publication, some of the scholarship has been superseded; for instance, in 2004, Thomas H. Brobjer published a more extensive account of Nietzsche's reading than that offered by Figl, and, based on that evidence, argues that Sprung had underestimated the amount of Indian philosophy that Nietzsche had read. Other writers have challenged the conclusions entirely; S. M. Amadae, though acknowledging that \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" features \"state of the art\" scholarship reaching conclusions typical of work in the area, feels that the work shows that \"the extent to which [Nietzsche] developed his thought in dialogue with the East is almost wholly unacknowledged.\" Instead, Amadae argues that Indian philosophy (and, specifically, Theravada Buddhism) were \"biographically and intellectually relevant\" to Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nWriting in 2008, Purushottama Bilimoria argues that the approach taken in \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" is one of three taken to the relationship between Nietzschean and Asian philosophy. For Bilimoria, the school represented by \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\" \"indicates that Nietzsche did not pay serious attention to Asian thought\", but that Nietzsche's thinking \"had an impact on Asian thinking up to modern times.\" By comparison, other approaches come from \"Nietzsche and Buddhism: Prolegomenon to Comparative Study\" (1981) by Freny Mistry and \"Nietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities\" (1997) by Robert G. Morrison. For Bilimoria, Mistry's account \"underscores the positive influence that Asian thought had on Nietzsche’s philosophy, especially in light of the new direction he sought to give to Western intellectual culture\", while Morrison \"argues that Nietzsche looked at Buddhism to find an anchor for his thesis of the ‘physiological origins’ of religion that would supersede the prevailing ‘transcendental ones’.\"\n\nA special issue of the \"Journal of Nietzsche Studies\" was published in 2004, aiming to build upon \"Nietzsche and Asian Thought\", which editor Peter S. Groff called \"pioneering\", as well as subsequent scholarship on the relationship between the thought of Nietzsche and Asian philosophy. The journal contained six articles on the subject. The first three, \"Nietzsche's reading about eastern philosophy\", by Thomas H. Brobjer, \"Nietzsche's Hinduism, Nietzsche's India: another look\", by David Smith, and \"The 'exotic' Nietzsche—East and West\", by Hans-Georg Moeller, relate to Nietzsche's knowledge of Asian philosophy, and interpretations of Nietzsche in Asia. The remaining three, \"Wandering beyond the bounds: nomadism, health, and self-undermining\", by Steve Coutinho and Geir Sigurdsson, \"Zen after Zarathustra: the problem of the will in the confrontation between Nietzsche and Buddhism\" by Bret W. Davis, and \"Al-Kindī and Nietzsche on the Stoic art of banishing sorrow\" by Peter S. Groff, are dialogues between Nietzsche and Asian figures.\n\n\n"}

He was the leader of the revolutionary democratic movement of the 1860s, and had an influence on Vladimir Lenin, Emma Goldman, and Serbian political writer and socialist Svetozar Marković.\n\nThe son of a priest, Chernyshevsky was born in Saratov in 1828, and stayed there till 1846. He graduated at the local seminary where he learned English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek and Old Slavonic. It was there he gained a love of literature. At St Petersburg university he often struggled to warm his room. He kept a diary of trivia like the number of tears he shed over a dead friend. It was here that he became an atheist.\n\nHe was inspired by the works of Ludwig Feuerbach and Charles Fourier. After graduating from Saint Petersburg University in 1850, he taught literature at a gymnasium in Saratov. From 1853 to 1862, he lived in Saint Petersburg, and became the chief editor of \"Sovremennik\" (“The Contemporary”), in which he published his main literary reviews and his essays on philosophy.\n\nIn 1862, he was arrested and confined in the Fortress of St. Peter and Paul, where he wrote his famous novel \"What Is to Be Done?\" The novel was an inspiration to many later Russian revolutionaries, who sought to emulate the novel's hero Rakhmetov, who was wholly dedicated to the revolution, ascetic in his habits and ruthlessly disciplined, to the point of sleeping on a bed of nails and eating only raw steak in order to build strength for the Revolution. Among those who have referenced the novel include Lenin, who wrote a work of political theory of the same name.\n\nIn 1862, Chernyshevsky was sentenced to \"civil execution\" (mock execution), followed by penal servitude (1864–72), and by exile to Vilyuisk, Siberia (1872–83). He died at the age of 61.\n\nChernyshevsky was a founder of \"Narodism\", Russian populism, and agitated for the revolutionary overthrow of the autocracy and the creation of a socialist society based on the old peasant commune.\n\nChernyshevsky’s ideas were heavily influenced by Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky, and Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach. He saw class struggle as the means of society’s forward movement and advocated for the interests of the working people. In his view, the masses were the chief maker of history. He is reputed to have used the phrase “the worse the better”, to indicate that the worse the social conditions became for the poor, the more inclined they would be to launch a revolution.\n\nThere are those arguing, in the words of Professor Joseph Frank, that “Chernyshevsky’s novel \"What Is to Be Done?\", far more than Marx’s \"Das Kapital\", supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution”.\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky was enraged by what he saw as the simplicity of the political and psychological ideas expressed in the book, and wrote \"Notes from Underground\" largely as a reaction against it.\n\n\n\n"}

He was “an experienced preacher and promoter of crusades”. Over 1000 of his sermons survive.\nOdo was born at Châteauroux around the year 1190.\n\nHe preached murderous crusade in 1226. He was chancellor of the University of Paris 1238-1244, and perhaps also Cistercian abbot of Ourscamp, and then abbot of Grandselve. Odo of Ourscamp is a different figure, of the twelfth century. However, several sources deny, doubt or ignore that he was a monk.\n\nHe was involved in the aftermath of the Paris disputation of 1240, and subsequent condemnation of the \"Talmud\". After the disputation a tribunal was appointed to pass judgment upon the Talmud, among its members being Eudes de Chateauroux, Chancellor of the University of Paris; Guillaume d'Auvergne, Bishop of Paris; and the Inquisitor Henri de Cologne. After the same rabbis had been heard a second time, the Talmud was condemned to be burned. Two years after (in the middle of 1242) twenty-four cartloads of Hebrew books were burned at Paris. [...] A little later, while at Lyons, the pope listened to the complaints of the Jews, and in 1247 he asked Eudes de Chateauroux to examine the Talmud from the Jewish standpoint, and to ascertain whether it might not be tolerated as harmless to the Christian faith, and whether the copies which had been confiscated might not be returned to their owners. The rabbis had represented to him that without the aid of the Talmud they could not understand the Bible or the rest of their statutes. Eudes informed the pope that the change of attitude involved in such a decision would be wrongly interpreted, and on 15 May 1248 the Talmud was condemned for the second time. A long list of supposed \"errors and blasphemies\" contained the Talmud was compiled by Eudes de Chateauroux. He was made cardinal-bishop of Frascati (1244). He is given also as bishop of Toulouse and bishop of Maguelonne and legate, and was sent to preach murderous crusade in France by Pope Innocent IV. He accompanied Louis IX of France on the Seventh Crusade, and is mentioned by Joinville, returning in 1254, via Cyprus. Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals from December 1254 and Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church in 1270.\n\nHe brought back relics, which he gave to Viterbo, Tournai and Neuvy-Saint-Sépulcre, Indre, France. He also consecrated relics in the Sainte-Chapelle. He led the enquiry into the canonization of Richard of Chichester. In 1270, on the death of Louis IX, he announced official mourning for the whole of Christendom.\n\nHe died on 25 January 1273 at Orvieto.\n\n\nFor a list of manuscripts containing Super Psalterium see « Eudes de Châteauroux » in Viller, Marcel.

A phenomenological-hermeneutic Analysis\". He has an MA (mag.art.) in the History of Ideas from Aarhus University.\n\nAs a professional philosopher, Kirkeby focused on the event as the centre of being. In order to describe the event, he conceived it as a way in which the body-mind (his neologism) absorbed the event by being absorbed by it. The media in which this takes place is language. Thus Kirkeby combined the theory of language games, and the phenomenological tradition, with its emphasis on self-reflective being (Heidegger), and the theory of bodily incorporation developed by Merleau-Ponty, interpreted through the Stoic vocabulary of the event, into an epistemological theory of the way in which we are “evented”.\n\nIn his philosophical trilogy about the event, with the volumes ”Eventum Tantum – The Ethos of the Event (“Eventum Tantum - Begivenhedens ethos,” København: Samfundslitteratur, 2005); Beauty Happens.

Samfundslitteratur) 2008, he created a new framework for approaching the event.\n\nKirkeby developed a theory of the Good and Welfare, which will be published in the autumn 2011 by Gyldendal, Copenhagen.\n\nKirkeby also worked intensively with business economics, creating a new agenda for leadership, exerting a great influence on managers in Denmark. He focused a radical-normative perspective on leadership, emphasizing leadership virtues, the duty of the leader to make values real, and the indispensable importance of the leader to know himself. He wrote several bestsellers inside this field, among others \"The Philosophy of Management. A Radical-Normative Perspective\" (”Ledelsesfilosofi. Et Radikalt Normativt Perspektiv”, København: Samfundslitteratur, 1997, tranl. To Swedish); \"The New Leadership\" (”Det Nye Lederskab”.

Copenhagen: CBS Press 2009.\n\nKirkeby has been active as an author of fiction with the books \"Philosophical Stories\" (”Filosofiske Fortællinger”. København: Lindhardt & Ringhof, 2004); More Philosophical Short Stories (Flere filosofiske fortællinger: Lindhardt og Ringhof, København 2008).\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000, Kirkeby co-developed and was the head of the studyboard at the MSc study programmes in Economics & Business Administration (cand.merc.) at the Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. In 2002, Kirkeby founded the Center for Art and Leadership at CBS, with particular emphasis on the way arts are able to inspire leadership. He still functions as its director. In 2003 he co-founded a Danish think tank on Public Governance together with The SAS Institute, Denmark. From 2006-2008 he was Professor II at Trøndelag Research & Development, Norway, in Art, business and philosophy.\n\nIn 2007 he developed experimental theatre together with Bent Noergaard, developing and participating in the play \"The Creative Human Being\", Centre for Art and Science, SDU.

According to Diogenes, it was divided into three discourses; one on the universe, another on politics (and ethics), and one on theology. Theophrastus says (in Diogenes) \"... some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley.\"\n\nDiogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book, inscribed on a single papyrus roll, as a dedication in the great temple of Artemis, the Artemisium, at Ephesus, one of the largest temples of the 6th century BCE and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances; furthermore, many subsequent philosophers in this period refer to the work. Says Kahn: \"Down to the time of Plutarch and Clement, if not later, the little book of Heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out.\" Diogenes says: \"the book acquired such fame that it produced partisans of his philosophy who were called Heracliteans.\"\n\nAs with other pre-Socratics, his writings only survive in quoted by other authors.\n"}

Its proponents developed methods of structuralist literary analysis and a theory of the standard language and of language cultivation during the years 1928–1939. The linguistic circle was founded in the Café Derby in Prague, which is also where meetings took place during its first years.\n\nThe Prague School has had a significant continuing influence on linguistics and semiotics. Following the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948, the circle was disbanded in 1952, but the Prague School continued as a major force in linguistic functionalism (distinct from the Copenhagen school or English Firthian — later Hallidean — linguistics). American scholar Dell Hymes cites his 1962 paper, \"The Ethnography of Speaking,\" as the formal introduction of Prague functionalism to American linguistic anthropology.\n\nThe Prague linguistic circle included the Russian émigrés Roman Jakobson, Nikolai Trubetzkoy, and Sergei Karcevskiy, as well as the famous Czech literary scholars René Wellek and Jan Mukařovský. The instigator of the circle, and its first president until his death in 1945, was the Czech linguist Vilém Mathesius.\n\nIn 1929 the Circle promulgated its theses in a paper submitted to the First Congress of Slavists. \"The programmatic 1929 Prague \"Theses\", surely one of the most imposing linguistic edifices of the 20th century, incapsulated [sic] the functionalist credo.\" In the late 20th century, English translations of the Circle's seminal works were published by the Czech linguist Josef Vachek in several collections.\n\nAlso in 1929, the group launched a journal, \"Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Prague\".

In practice the present may be given before or after the birth, or even in the delivery room. The giving of push presents has supposedly grown in the United States in recent years.\nA \"push gift\" is any type of present loved ones give to a woman who has recently given birth to a child. There is no conclusive evidence that the present was invented by the jewelry industry to sell more goods, and until recently it was passed on largely by word of mouth or peer pressure among both mothers and fathers. According to Linda Murray, the executive editor of BabyCenter, \"It's an expectation of moms these days that they deserve something for bearing the burden for nine months, getting sick, ruining their body. The guilt really gets piled on.\" Other sources trace the development of the present to the increased assertiveness of women, allowing them to ask for a present more directly, or the increased involvement of the men in pregnancy, making them more informed of the pain and difficulty of pregnancy and labor.\n\nA 2004 survey of over 30,000 respondents by BabyCenter found that 38% of new mothers received a push present, and 55% of pregnant mothers wanted one, though fewer thought it was actually expected. About 40% of both groups said the baby itself was already a present and did not wish an additional reward. \n\nThe popularity of push presents has been attributed in part to media coverage of celebrities receiving them. Examples include a 10 carat diamond ring given to celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe by her husband Rodger after the 2011 birth of their son, a Bentley given to reality TV star Peggy Tanous of \"The Real Housewives of Orange County\" by her husband Micah after the 2007 birth of their daughter, and a diamond and sapphire necklace given to singer Mariah Carey by her husband Nick Cannon after the 2011 birth of their twins.\n\nThe trend has generated a backlash, as some couples dislike the implicit materialism of push presents, and would prefer increased help in chores or baby care, or save the money for the child's education.\n\nAccording to etiquette expert Pamela Holland, there are no set guidelines for push presents. \"The standard is that there is no standard,\" she said. \"It does make sense to have etiquette around wedding or baby shower gifts because you're inviting other people into it. But this is far too intimate to have a rule.\" In general it is the woman who lets her man know about push presents, not the other way around, although there can be peer pressure from friends to buy one on either the man or the woman.\n\nAnalysis of conversations on parenting website the BabyCentre's online community over the last three years found that mentions of push presents had increased by 41 per cent in the past 18 months, compared to only a two per cent increase between 2011 and 2012. A poll of 1,200 BabyCentre mothers also revealed that more than a quarter (27 per cent) were expecting, or had already received, a 'push present' this year. Diamonds were the most popular gift in the form of an eternity ring with the prices spent ranging from £500 to £1475. Tablet computers, charm bracelets and designer watches and handbags were also popular gifts to celebrate a new arrival.\n"}

The term was introduced by American philosopher Donald Davidson (1973) and is meant to suggest important similarity to W. V. O. Quine's term radical translation, which occurs in his work on the indeterminacy of translation. Radical translation\nis translation of a speaker's language, without prior knowledge, by observing the speaker's use of the language in context.\n\nEven more so than radical translation did for Quine, radical interpretation plays an important role in Davidson's work, but the exact nature of this role is up for debate. Some see Davidson as using radical interpretation directly in his arguments against conceptual relativism and the possibility of massive error--of most of our beliefs being false. But Davidson seems to explicitly reject this reading in \"Radical Interpretation Interpreted\".\n\nThere is also a more narrow and technical version of radical interpretation used by Davidson: given the speaker's attitudes of holding particular sentences true in particular circumstances, the speaker's hold-true attitudes, the radical interpreter is to infer a theory of meaning, a truth theory meeting a modified version of Alfred Tarski's Convention T, for the speaker's idiolect. Ernest Lepore and Kirk Ludwig characterize this as inference from sentences of the form:\n\nto corresponding T-sentences of the form\n\nwhere s is a sentence in the idiolect of the speaker S, t is a time, and p and q are filled in with sentences in the metalanguage.\n\n"}
{"id": "49720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49720", "title": "Robert Hooke", "text": "Robert Hooke\n\nRobert Hooke FRS (;  – 3 March 1703) was an English natural philosopher, architect and polymath.\n\nHis adult life comprised three distinct periods: as a scientific inquirer lacking money; achieving great wealth and standing through his reputation for hard work and scrupulous honesty following the great fire of 1666, and eventually becoming ill and party to jealous intellectual disputes (the last may have contributed to his relative historical obscurity).\n\nAt one time he was simultaneously the curator of experiments of the Royal Society, a member of its council, Gresham Professor of Geometry, and Surveyor to the City of London after the Great Fire of London (in which capacity he appears to have performed more than half of all the surveys after the fire). He was also an important architect of his time – though few of his buildings now survive and some of those are generally misattributed – and was instrumental in devising a set of planning controls for London whose influence remains today. Allan Chapman has characterised him as \"England's Leonardo\".\n\nHooke studied at Wadham College, Oxford during the Protectorate where he became one of a tightly knit group of ardent Royalists led by John Wilkins. Here he was employed as an assistant to Thomas Willis and to Robert Boyle, for whom he built the vacuum pumps used in Boyle's gas law experiments. He built some of the earliest Gregorian telescopes and observed the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. In 1665 he inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration with his book, \"Micrographia\". Based on his microscopic observations of fossils, Hooke was an early proponent of biological evolution. He investigated the phenomenon of refraction, deducing the wave theory of light, and was the first to suggest that matter expands when heated and that air is made of small particles separated by relatively large distances. He performed pioneering work in the field of surveying and map-making and was involved in the work that led to the first modern plan-form map, though his plan for London on a grid system was rejected in favour of rebuilding along the existing routes. He also came near to an experimental proof that gravity follows an inverse square law, and hypothesised that such a relation governs the motions of the planets, an idea which was independently developed by Isaac Newton. Much of Hooke's scientific work was conducted in his capacity as curator of experiments of the Royal Society, a post he held from 1662, or as part of the household of Robert Boyle.\n\nMuch of what is known of Hooke's early life comes from an autobiography that he commenced in 1696 but never completed. Richard Waller mentions it in his introduction to \"The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.\", printed in 1705. In the chapter \"Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits\", Hooke argues that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography, to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I. The work of Waller, along with John Ward's \"Lives of the Gresham Professors\" (with a list of his major works) and John Aubrey's \"Brief Lives\", form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of Hooke.\n\nRobert Hooke was born in 1635 in Freshwater on the Isle of Wight to John Hooke and Cecily Gyles. Robert was the last of four children, two boys and two girls, and there was an age difference of seven years between him and the next youngest. Their father John was a Church of England priest, the curate of Freshwater's Church of All Saints, and his two brothers (Robert's uncles) were also ministers. Robert Hooke was expected to succeed in his education and join the Church. John Hooke also was in charge of a local school, and so was able to teach Robert, at least partly at home perhaps due to the boy's frail health. He was a Royalist and almost certainly a member of a group who went to pay their respects to Charles I when he escaped to the Isle of Wight. Robert, too, grew up to be a staunch monarchist.\n\nAs a youth, Robert Hooke was fascinated by observation, mechanical works, and drawing, interests that he would pursue in various ways throughout his life. He dismantled a brass clock and built a wooden replica that, by all accounts, worked \"well enough\", and he learned to draw, making his own materials from coal, chalk and ruddle (iron ore).\n\nOn his father's death in 1648, Robert was left a sum of forty pounds that enabled him to buy an apprenticeship; with his poor health throughout his life but evident mechanical facility his father had it in mind that he might become a watchmaker or limner (a decorator of illuminated manuscripts), though Hooke was also interested in painting. Hooke was an apt student, so although he went to London to take up an apprenticeship, and studied briefly with Samuel Cowper and Peter Lely, he was soon able to enter Westminster School in London, under Dr. Richard Busby. Hooke quickly mastered Latin and Greek, made some study of Hebrew, and mastered Euclid's \"Elements\". Here, too, he embarked on his lifelong study of mechanics.\n\nIt appears that Hooke was one of a group of students whom Busby educated in parallel to the main work of the school. Contemporary accounts say he was \"not much seen\" in the school, and this appears to be true of others in a similar position. Busby, an ardent and outspoken Royalist (he had the school observe a fast-day on the anniversary of the King's beheading), was by all accounts trying to preserve the nascent spirit of scientific inquiry that had begun to flourish in Carolean England but which was at odds with the literal Biblical teachings of the Protectorate. To Busby and his select students the Anglican Church was a framework to support the spirit of inquiry into God's work, those who were able were destined by God to explore and study His creation, and the priesthood functioned as teachers to explain it to those who were less able. This was exemplified in the person of George Hooper, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, whom Busby described as \"the best scholar, the finest gentleman and will make the completest bishop that ever was educated at Westminster School\".\n\nIn 1653, Hooke (who had also undertaken a course of twenty lessons on the organ) secured a chorister's place at Christ Church, Oxford. He was employed as a \"chemical assistant\" to Dr Thomas Willis, for whom Hooke developed a great admiration. There he met the natural philosopher Robert Boyle, and gained employment as his assistant from about 1655 to 1662, constructing, operating, and demonstrating Boyle's \"machina Boyleana\" or air pump. It was not until 1662 or 1663 that was awarded a Master of Arts degree. In 1659 Hooke described some elements of a method of heavier-than-air flight to Wilkins, but concluded that human muscles were insufficient to the task.\n\nHooke himself characterised his Oxford days as the foundation of his lifelong passion for science, and the friends he made there were of paramount importance to him throughout his career, particularly Christopher Wren. Wadham was then under the guidance of John Wilkins, who had a profound impact on Hooke and those around him. Wilkins was also a Royalist, and acutely conscious of the turmoil and uncertainty of the times. There was a sense of urgency in preserving the scientific work which they perceived as being threatened by the Protectorate. Wilkins' \"philosophical meetings\" in his study were clearly important, though few records survive except for the experiments Boyle conducted in 1658 and published in 1660. This group went on to form the nucleus of the Royal Society. Hooke developed an air pump for Boyle's experiments based on the pump of Ralph Greatorex, which was considered, in Hooke's words, \"too gross to perform any great matter.\" It is known that Hooke had a particularly keen eye, and was an adept mathematician, neither of which applied to Boyle. It has been suggested that Hooke probably made the observations and may well have developed the mathematics of Boyle's law. Regardless, it is clear that Hooke was a valued assistant to Boyle and the two retained a mutual high regard.\n\nA chance surviving copy of Willis' pioneering \"De anima brutorum\", a gift from the author, was chosen by Hooke from Wilkins' library on his death as a memento at John Tillotson's invitation. This book is now in the Wellcome Library. The book and its inscription in Hooke's hand are a testament to the lasting influence of Wilkins and his circle on the young Hooke.\n\nThe Royal Society was founded in 1660, and in April 1661 the society debated a short tract on the rising of water in slender glass pipes, in which Hooke reported that the height water rose was related to the bore of the pipe (due to what is now termed capillary action). His explanation of this phenomenon was subsequently published in \"Micrography Observ.\" issue 6, in which he also explored the nature of \"the fluidity of gravity\". On 5 November 1661, Sir Robert Moray proposed that a Curator be appointed to furnish the society with Experiments, and this was unanimously passed with Hooke being named. His appointment was made on 12 November, with thanks recorded to Dr. Boyle for releasing him to the Society's employment.\n\nIn 1664, Sir John Cutler settled an annual gratuity of fifty pounds on the Society for the founding of a \"Mechanick Lecture\", and the Fellows appointed Hooke to this task. On 27 June 1664 he was confirmed to the office, and on 11 January 1665 was named \"Curator by Office\" for life with an additional salary of £30 to Cutler's annuity.\n\nHooke's role at the Royal Society was to demonstrate experiments from his own methods or at the suggestion of members. Among his earliest demonstrations were discussions of the nature of air, the implosion of glass bubbles which had been sealed with comprehensive hot air, and demonstrating that the \"Pabulum vitae\" and \"flammae\" were one and the same. He also demonstrated that a dog could be kept alive with its thorax opened, provided air was pumped in and out of its lungs, and noting the difference between venous and arterial blood. There were also experiments on the subject of gravity, the falling of objects, the weighing of bodies and measuring of barometric pressure at different heights, and pendulums up to .\n\nInstruments were devised to measure a second of arc in the movement of the sun or other stars, to measure the strength of gunpowder, and in particular an engine to cut teeth for watches, much finer than could be managed by hand, an invention which was, by Hooke's death, in constant use.\n\nIn 1663 and 1664, Hooke produced his microscopy observations, subsequently collated in \"Micrographia\" in 1665.\n\nOn 20 March 1664, Hooke succeeded Arthur Dacres as Gresham Professor of Geometry. Hooke received the degree of \"Doctor of Physic\" in December 1691.\nThere is a widely reported story that Dr Hooke corresponded with Thomas Newcomen in connection with Newcomen's invention of the steam engine. This story was discussed by Rhys Jenkins, a past President of the Newcomen Society, in 1936. Jenkins traced the origin of the story to an article \"Steam Engines\" by Dr. John Robison (1739–1805) in the third edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica”, which says \"There are to be found among Hooke's papers, in the possession of the Royal Society, some notes of observations, for the use of Newcomen, his countryman, on Papin's boasted method of transmitting to a great distance the action of an mill by means of pipes\", and that Hooke had dissuaded Newcomen from erecting a machine on this principle. Jenkins points out a number of errors in Robison's article, and questions whether the correspondent might in fact have been Newton, whom Hooke is known to have corresponded with, the name being misread as Newcomen. A search by Mr. H W Dickinson of Hooke's papers held by the Royal Society, which had been bound together in the middle of the 18th century, i.e. before Robison's time, and carefully preserved since, revealed no trace of any correspondence between Hooke and Newcomen. Jenkins concluded \"... this story must be omitted from the history of the steam engine, at any rate until documentary evidence is forthcoming.\"\n\nIn the intervening years since 1936 no such evidence has been found, but the story persists. For instance, in a book published in 2011 it is said that \"in a letter dated 1703 Hooke did suggest that Newcomen use condensing steam to drive the piston.\"\n\nHooke was irascible, at least in later life, proud, and prone to take umbrage with intellectual competitors, though he was by all accounts also a staunch friend and ally and was loyal always to the circle of ardent Royalists with whom he had his early training at Wadham College, particularly Christopher Wren. His reputation suffered after his death and this is popularly attributed to a dispute with Isaac Newton over credit for his work on gravitation, the planets and to a lesser degree light. His dispute with Oldenburg about whether Oldenburg had leaked or passed on details of Hooke's watch escapement to others is another well-known example.\n\nNewton, as President of the Royal Society, did much to obscure Hooke, including, it is said, destroying (or failing to preserve) the only known portrait of the man. It did not help that the first biography of Wren, \"Parentalia\", was written by Wren's son, and tended to exaggerate Wren's work over all others. Hooke's reputation was revived during the twentieth century through studies of Robert Gunther and Margaret 'Espinasse. After a long period of relative obscurity he has now been recognised as one of the most important scientists of his age.\n\nHooke was apt to use ciphers and guard his ideas. As curator of Experiments to the Royal Society he was responsible for demonstrating many ideas sent in to the Society, and there is evidence that he would subsequently assume some credit for these ideas. Hooke also was immensely busy and thus unable – or in some cases unwilling, pending a way of profiting from the enterprise via letters patent – to develop all of his own ideas. This was a time of immense scientific progress, and numerous ideas were developed in several places simultaneously.\n\nNone of this should distract from Hooke's inventiveness, his remarkable experimental facility, and his capacity for hard work. His ideas about gravitation, and his claim of priority for the inverse square law, are outlined below. He was granted a large number of patents for inventions and refinements in the fields of elasticity, optics, and barometry. The Royal Society's Hooke papers (recently discovered after disappearing when Newton took over) will open up a modern reassessment.\nMuch has been written about the unpleasant side of Hooke's personality, starting with comments by his first biographer, Richard Waller, that Hooke was \"in person, but despicable\" and \"melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous.\" Waller's comments influenced other writers for well over two centuries, so that a picture of Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon dominates many older books and articles. For example, Arthur Berry said that Hooke \"claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries of the time.\" Sullivan wrote that Hooke was \"positively unscrupulous\" and possessing an \"uneasy apprehensive vanity\" in dealings with Newton. Manuel used the phrase \"cantankerous, envious, vengeful\" in his description. More described Hooke having both a \"cynical temperament\" and a \"caustic tongue.\" Andrade was more sympathetic, but still used the adjectives \"difficult\", \"suspicious\", and \"irritable\" in describing Hooke.\n\nThe publication of Hooke's diary in 1935 revealed other sides of the man that 'Espinasse, in particular, has detailed carefully. She writes that \"the picture which is usually painted of Hooke as a morose and envious recluse is completely false.\" Hooke interacted with noted craftsmen such as Thomas Tompion, the clockmaker, and Christopher Cocks (Cox), an instrument maker. Hooke often met Christopher Wren, with whom he shared many interests, and had a lasting friendship with John Aubrey. Hooke's diaries also make frequent reference to meetings at coffeehouses and taverns, and to dinners with Robert Boyle. He took tea on many occasions with his lab assistant, Harry Hunt. Within his family, Hooke took both a niece and a cousin into his home, teaching them mathematics.\n\nRobert Hooke spent his life largely on the Isle of Wight, at Oxford, and in London. He never married, but his diary records that he had sexual relations with his niece, Grace, and several of his housekeepers. He at one point records that one of these housekeepers gave birth to a girl, but doesn't note the paternity of the child. On 3 March 1703, Hooke died in London, and a chest containing £8,000 in money and gold was found in his room at Gresham College. Although he had talked of leaving a generous bequest to the Royal Society which would have given his name to a library, laboratory and lectures, no will was found and the money passed to an illiterate cousin, Elizabeth Stephens. He was buried at St Helen's Bishopsgate, but the precise location of his grave is unknown.\n\nIn 1660, Hooke discovered the law of elasticity which bears his name and which describes the linear variation of tension with extension in an elastic spring. He first described this discovery in the anagram \"ceiiinosssttuv\", whose solution he published in 1678 as \"Ut tensio, sic vis\" meaning \"As the extension, so the force.\" Hooke's work on elasticity culminated, for practical purposes, in his development of the balance spring or hairspring, which for the first time enabled a portable timepiece – a watch – to keep time with reasonable accuracy. A bitter dispute between Hooke and Christiaan Huygens on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both; but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the Hooke Folio (see \"External links\" below), describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, has been held to favour Hooke's claim.\n\nIt is interesting from a twentieth-century vantage point that Hooke first announced his law of elasticity as an anagram. This was a method sometimes used by scientists, such as Hooke, Huygens, Galileo, and others, to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details.\n\nHooke became Curator of Experiments in 1662 to the newly founded Royal Society, and took responsibility for experiments performed at its weekly meetings. This was a position he held for over 40 years. While this position kept him in the thick of science in Britain and beyond, it also led to some heated arguments with other scientists, such as Huygens (see above) and particularly with Isaac Newton and the Royal Society's Henry Oldenburg. In 1664 Hooke also was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in London and Cutlerian Lecturer in Mechanics.\n\nOn 8 July 1680, Hooke observed the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates. He ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge. In acoustics, in 1681 he showed the Royal Society that musical tones could be generated from spinning brass cogs cut with teeth in particular proportions.\n\nWhile many of his contemporaries believed in the aether as a medium for transmitting attraction or repulsion between separated celestial bodies, Hooke argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in \"Micrographia\" (1665). Hooke's 1666 Royal Society lecture on gravity added two further principles: that all bodies move in straight lines till deflected by some force and that the attractive force is stronger for closer bodies. Dugald Stewart quoted Hooke's own words on his system of the world. \"I will explain,\" says Hooke, in a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, \"a system of the world very different from any yet received. It is founded on the following positions. 1. That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but that they also mutually attract each other within their spheres of action. 2. That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, an ellipse, or some other curve. 3. That this attraction is so much the greater as the bodies are nearer. As to the proportion in which those forces diminish by an increase of distance, I own I have not discovered it...\"\n\nHooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to \"all celestial bodies\" and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines.\n\nHooke published his ideas about the \"System of the World\" again in somewhat developed form in 1674, as an addition to \"An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations\". Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body.\n\nHooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions. Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses. Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration. On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: \"Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified\" (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow); and as to his whole proposal: \"This I only hint at present\", \"having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it\" (i.e. \"prosecuting this Inquiry\").\n\nIn November 1679, Hooke initiated a remarkable exchange of letters with Newton (of which the full text is now published). Hooke's ostensible purpose was to tell Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence. Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others; and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning \"compounding the celestial motions of the planetts of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body\", and \"my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse\", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton's reply offered \"a fansy of my own\" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall. The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre). Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move. A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1679|80 to Newton, communicated his \"supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance.\" (Hooke's inference about the velocity was actually incorrect)\n\nIn 1686, when the first book of Newton's \"Principia\" was presented to the Royal Society, Hooke claimed that he had given Newton the \"notion\" of \"the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center\". At the same time (according to Edmond Halley's contemporary report) Hooke agreed that \"the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby\" was wholly Newton's.\n\nA recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that \"by the late 1660s,\" the assumption of an \"inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons\". Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center. Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke. Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid \"at great distances from the center\".\n\nOn the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the 'Principia', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1. Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: \"yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things & for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it.\"\n\nOne of the contrasts between the two men was that Newton was primarily a pioneer in mathematical analysis and its applications as well as optical experimentation, while Hooke was a creative experimenter of such great range, that it is not surprising to find that he left some of his ideas, such as those about gravitation, undeveloped. This in turn makes it understandable how in 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, Alexis Clairaut, mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation. \"One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory\", Clairaut wrote; \"The example of Hooke\" serves \"to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated\".\n\nHooke made tremendously important contributions to the science of timekeeping, being intimately involved in the advances of his time; the introduction of the pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, the balance spring to improve the timekeeping of watches, and the proposal that a precise timekeeper could be used to find the longitude at sea.\n\nIn 1655, according to his autobiographical notes, Hooke began to acquaint himself with astronomy, through the good offices of John Ward. Hooke applied himself to the improvement of the pendulum and in 1657 or 1658, he began to improve on pendulum mechanisms, studying the work of Giovanni Riccioli, and going on to study both gravitation and the mechanics of timekeeping.\n\nHenry Sully, writing in Paris in 1717, described the anchor escapement as \"an admirable invention of which Dr. Hooke, formerly professor of geometry in Gresham College at London, was the inventor.\" William Derham also attributes it to Hooke.\n\nHooke recorded that he conceived of a way to determine longitude (then a critical problem for navigation), and with the help of Boyle and others he attempted to patent it. In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising, fitted with a coil spring attached to the arbour of the balance. Hooke's ultimate failure to secure sufficiently lucrative terms for the exploitation of this idea resulted in its being shelved, and evidently caused him to become more jealous of his inventions.\n\nHooke developed the balance spring independently of and at least 5 years before Christiaan Huygens, who published his own work in \"Journal de Scavans\" in February 1675.\n\nIn 1665 Hooke published \"Micrographia\", a book describing observations made with microscopes and telescopes, as well as some original work in biology. Hooke coined the term \"cell\" for describing biological organisms, the term being suggested by the resemblance of plant cells to cells of a honeycomb. The hand-crafted, leather and gold-tooled microscope he used to make the observations for \"Micrographia\", originally constructed by Christopher White in London, is on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Micrographia\" also contains Hooke's, or perhaps Boyle and Hooke's, ideas on combustion. Hooke's experiments led him to conclude that combustion involves a substance that is mixed with air, a statement with which modern scientists would agree, but that was not understood widely, if at all, in the seventeenth century. Hooke went on to conclude that respiration also involves a specific component of the air. Partington even goes so far as to claim that if \"Hooke had continued his experiments on combustion it is probable that he would have discovered oxygen\".\n\nOne of the observations in \"Micrographia\" was of fossil wood, the microscopic structure of which he compared to ordinary wood. This led him to conclude that fossilised objects like petrified wood and fossil shells, such as Ammonites, were the remains of living things that had been soaked in petrifying water laden with minerals. Hooke believed that such fossils provided reliable clues to the past history of life on earth, and, despite the objections of contemporary naturalists like John Ray who found the concept of extinction theologically unacceptable, that in some cases they might represent species that had become extinct through some geological disaster.\n\nCharles Lyell wrote the following in his (1832).\n'The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke M.D.,'... appeared in 1705, containing 'A Discourse of Earthquakes'... His treatise... is the most philosophical production of that age, in regard to the causes of former changes in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature. 'However trivial a thing,' he says, 'a rotten shell may appear to some, yet these monuments of nature are more certain tokens of antiquity than coins or medals, since the best of those may be counterfeited or made by art and design, as may also books, manuscripts, and inscriptions, as all the learned are now sufficiently satisfied has often been actually practised,' &c.; 'and though it must be granted that it is very difficult to read them and to raise a chronology out of them, and to state the intervals of the time wherein such or such catastrophes and mutations have happened, yet it is not impossible.\nOne of the more-challenging problems tackled by Hooke was the measurement of the distance to a star (other than the Sun). The star chosen was Gamma Draconis and the method to be used was parallax determination. After several months of observing, in 1669, Hooke believed that the desired result had been achieved. It is now known that Hooke's equipment was far too imprecise to allow the measurement to succeed. Gamma Draconis was the same star James Bradley used in 1725 in discovering the aberration of light.\n\nHooke's activities in astronomy extended beyond the study of stellar distance. His \"Micrographia\" contains illustrations of the Pleiades star cluster as well as of lunar craters. He performed experiments to study how such craters might have formed. Hooke also was an early observer of the rings of Saturn, and discovered one of the first observed double-star systems, Gamma Arietis, in 1664.\n\nA lesser-known contribution, however one of the first of its kind, was Hooke's scientific model of human memory. Hooke in a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society proposed a mechanistic model of human memory, which would bear little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models before it. This model addressed the components of encoding, memory capacity, repetition, retrieval, and forgetting – some with surprising modern accuracy. This work, overlooked for nearly 200 years, shared a variety of similarities with Richard Semon's work of 1919/1923, both assuming memories were physical and located in the brain. The model's more interesting points are that it (1) allows for attention and other top-down influences on encoding; (2) it uses resonance to implement parallel, cue-dependent retrieval; (3) it explains memory for recency; (4) it offers a single-system account of repetition and priming, and (5) the power law of forgetting can be derived from the model's assumption in a straightforward way. This lecture would be published posthumously in 1705 as the memory model was unusually placed in a series of works on the nature of light. It has been speculated that this work saw little review as the printing was done in small batches in a post-Newtonian age of science and was most likely deemed out of date by the time it was published. Further interfering with its success was contemporary memory psychologists' rejection of immaterial souls, which Hooke invoked to some degree in regards to the processes of attention, encoding and retrieval.\n\nHooke was Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant to Christopher Wren, in which capacity he helped Wren rebuild London after the Great Fire in 1666, and also worked on the design of London's Monument to the fire, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Montagu House in Bloomsbury, and the Bethlem Royal Hospital (which became known as 'Bedlam'). Other buildings designed by Hooke include The Royal College of Physicians (1679), Ragley Hall in Warwickshire, Ramsbury Manor in Wiltshire and the parish church of St Mary Magdalene at Willen in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. Hooke's collaboration with Christopher Wren also included St Paul's Cathedral, whose dome uses a method of construction conceived by Hooke. Hooke also participated in the design of the Pepys Library, which held the manuscripts of Samuel Pepys' diaries, the most frequently cited eyewitness account of the Great Fire of London.\n\nHooke and Wren both being keen astronomers, the Monument was designed to serve a scientific function as a telescope for observing transits, though Hooke's characteristically precise measurements after completion showed that the movement of the column in the wind made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy of this can be observed in the construction of the spiral staircase, which has no central column, and in the observation chamber which remains in place below ground level.\n\nIn the reconstruction after the Great Fire, Hooke proposed redesigning London's streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards and arteries, a pattern subsequently used in the renovation of Paris, Liverpool, and many American cities. This proposal was thwarted by arguments over property rights, as property owners were surreptitiously shifting their boundaries. Hooke was in demand to settle many of these disputes, due to his competence as a surveyor and his tact as an arbitrator.\n\nFor an extensive study of Hooke's architectural work, see the book by Cooper.\n\nNo authenticated portrait of Robert Hooke exists. This situation has sometimes been attributed to the heated conflicts between Hooke and Newton, although Hooke's biographer Allan Chapman rejects as a myth the claims that Newton or his acolytes deliberately destroyed Hooke's portrait. German antiquarian and scholar Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach visited the Royal Society in 1710 and his account of his visit specifically mentions him being shown the portraits of 'Boyle and Hoock' (which were said to be good likenesses), but while Boyle's portrait survives, Hooke's has evidently been lost. In Hooke's time, the Royal Society met at Gresham College, but within a few months of Hooke's death Newton became the Society's president and plans were laid for a new meeting place. When the move to new quarters finally was made a few years later, in 1710, Hooke's Royal Society portrait went missing, and has yet to be found.\n\nTwo contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance have survived. The first was recorded by his close friend John Aubrey, who described Hooke in middle age and at the height of his creative powers:\n\nThe second is a rather unflattering description of Hooke as an old man, written by Richard Waller:\n\n\"Time\" magazine published a portrait, supposedly of Hooke, on 3 July 1939. However, when the source was traced by Ashley Montagu, it was found to lack a verifiable connection to Hooke. Moreover, Montagu found that two contemporary written descriptions of Hooke's appearance agreed with one another, but that neither matched the \"Time\"'s portrait.\n\nIn 2003, historian Lisa Jardine claimed that a recently discovered portrait was of Hooke, but this claim was disproved by William Jensen of the University of Cincinnati. The portrait identified by Jardine depicts the Flemish scholar Jan Baptist van Helmont.\n\nOther possible likenesses of Hooke include the following:\n\nIn 2003 history painter Rita Greer embarked on a self-funded project to memorialise Hooke. The Rita Greer Robert Hooke project aimed to produce credible images of him, both painted and drawn, that fitted his contemporary descriptions by John Aubrey and Richard Waller. Greer's images of Hooke, his life and work have been used for TV programmes in UK and US, in books, magazines and for PR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2951290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2951290", "title": "Takis Fotopoulos", "text": "Takis Fotopoulos\n\nTakis Fotopoulos ( born October 14, 1940) is a political philosopher and economist who founded the Inclusive Democracy movement, aiming at a synthesis of classical democracy with libertarian socialism and the radical currents in the new social movements. He was an academic, and has written many books and over 900 articles. He is the editor of \"The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy\" (which succeeded \"Democracy & Nature\") and is the author of \"Towards An Inclusive Democracy\" (1997) in which the foundations of the Inclusive Democracy project were set. His latest book is \"The New World Order in Action: Volume 1: Globalization, the Brexit Revolution and the \"Left\"- Towards a Democratic Community of Sovereign Nations\" (December 2016). Fotopoulos is Greek and lives in London.\n\nFotopoulos was born on the Greek island of Chios and his family moved to Athens soon afterwards. After graduating from the University of Athens with degrees in Economics and Political Science and in Law, he moved to London in 1966 for postgraduate study at the London School of Economics on a Varvaressos scholarship from Athens University. He was a student syndicalist and activist in Athens and then a political activist in London, taking an active part in the 1968 student protests in London, and in organisations of the revolutionary Greek Left during the struggle against the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. During this period, he was a member of the Greek group called Revolutionary Socialist Groups in London, which published the newspaper \"Μαμή\" (\"Midwife\", from the Marxian dictum, \"violence is the midwife of revolution\") for which he wrote several articles. Fotopoulos married Sia Mamareli (a former lawyer) in 1966; the couple have a son, Costas (born in 1974), who is a Composer and Pianist.\n\nFotopoulos was a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the Polytechnic of North London from 1969 to 1989, until he began editing the journal \"Society & Nature\", later \"Democracy & Nature\" and subsequently the online \"International Journal of Inclusive Democracy\". He was also a columnist of \"Eleftherotypia\", the second-biggest newspaper in Greece.\n\nFotopoulos developed the political project of Inclusive Democracy (ID) in 1997 (an exposition can be found in \"Towards An Inclusive Democracy\"). The first issue of \"Society & Nature\" declared that:\n\nour ambition is to initiate an urgently needed dialogue on the crucial question of developing a new liberatory social project, at a moment in History when the Left has abandoned this traditional role.\n\nIt specified that the new project should be seen as the outcome of a synthesis of the democratic, libertarian socialist and radical Green traditions. Since then, a dialogue has followed in the pages of the journal, in which supporters of the autonomy project like Cornelius Castoriadis, social ecology supporters including its founder Murray Bookchin, and Green activists and academics like Steven Best have taken part.\n\nThe starting point for Fotopoulos' work is that the world faces a multi-dimensional crisis (economic, ecological, social, cultural and political) which is caused by the concentration of power in elites, as a result of the market economy, representative democracy and related forms of hierarchical structure. An inclusive democracy, which involves the equal distribution of power at all levels, is seen not as a utopia (in the negative sense of the word) or a \"vision\" but as perhaps the only way out of the present crisis, with trends towards its creation manifesting themselves today in many parts of the world. Fotopoulos is in favor of market abolitionism, although he would not identify himself as a market abolitionist as such because he considers market abolition as one aspect of an inclusive democracy which refers only to the economic democracy component of it.

The movement began in the writings of Maraimalai Adigal, Paventhar Bharathidasan, Devaneya Pavanar, and Pavalareru Perunchitthiranaar, and was propagated in the \"Thenmozhi\" literary magazine founded by Pavalareru Perunchithiranar. V G Suryanarayana Sastri (popularly known as Parithimar Kalaignar), a Professor, was a 20th-century figure in the movement; in 1902 he demanded classical-language status for Tamil, which it received in 2004.\n\nThe modern revival of the Tamil Purist Movement (also known as the Pure Tamil Movement) is attributed to Maraimalai Adigal, who publicly pledged to defend pure Tamil in 1916. Advocates of purism popularised Tamil literature and crusaded for it, organising rallies in villages and towns and making Tamil purism a political issue. The logical extension of this effort was to purge Tamil of the Sanskrit influence (including its negative social perceptions, which were thought to keep the Tamils in a state of economic, cultural, and political servitude) seen as making Tamil susceptible to northern political domination. Anti-Sanskrit and anti-Hindi Tamil Nadu policies alienated the Brahmins, who were seen as supporting both languages.\n\nTamil was favoured by language policy after Indian independence and had been used in high schools since 1938 (and in universities from 1960). In 1956, the Indian National Congress government passed a law making Tamil the official language of Tamil Nadu, and in 1959 set up the Tamil Development and Research Council to produce Tamil textbooks in the natural and human sciences, accounting, mathematics, and other subjects. A series of children's encyclopaedias, commentaries on Sangam poetry, and a history of the Tamil people were published in 1962-63. However, these measures seemed insufficient to the proponents of \"Pure Tamil\", as expressed by Mohan Kumaramangalam in 1965 at the peak of the anti-Hindi agitation:\n\nIn practice, the ordinary man finds that the Tamil language is nowhere in the picture ... In Madras city like any other metro, English dominates our life to an extraordinary extent ... I think it will be no exaggeration to say that a person who earns very high can live for years in Madras without learning a word of Tamil, except for some servant inconvenience!\n\nSince the Congress government had turned down a number of demands, such as the use of \"pure\" rather than \"Sanskritised Tamil\" in schoolbooks and resisting the name change from Madras to Tamil Nadu until 1969, it seemed unconcerned about separatism. This bred resentment among Tamil purists, as expressed by Devaneya Pavanar in 1967: \n\nNone of the Congress Ministers of Tamil Nadu was either a Tamil scholar or a Tamil lover. The Congress leaders of Tamil Nadu as betrayers of Tamil, cannot represent the State any more. Blind cannot lead the blind, much less the keen sighted. Moreover every political meeting, they will say \"Jai Hind!\". This Means, they are meant to rule only in broader (not specific) India.\n\nIn the elections that year, Congress was replaced by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government under C N Annadurai.\n\nThe Tamil purism movement successfully lobbied for Tamil to be declared a \"classical language\" (uyarthanichemai) of India in 2006, a status also accorded to Sanskrit in the Indian constitution. This gave rise to the Centre for the Study of Tamil as a Classical Language in Chennai, but it took another year to obtain official Tamil translations in Tamil Nadu courts.\n\n\n\n"}

Originally started as a letter for friends, the book itself began as a mimeographed pamphlet which Golas handed out on the streets of San Francisco in 1971. It was first published as a book in 1971 by Joe E. Casey, but was then taken over by the Palo Alto, California based Seed Center in 1972. The book was an underground bestseller, and in 1979, was published by Bantam Books. In 1995, Gibbs Smith, Publisher, of Utah, issued a hardcover edition, which included photographs and an introduction by Golas. In 2010, Seed Center Books issued an audio recording of the text read by the author, and an international edition of the book returning it to its original look and format, with three new chapters and revisions, penned by the author late in life.\n\nThaddeus Golas, inspired by the popularity of subatomic physics and his passion for Eastern Mysticism, began formulating his personal metaphysical paradigm in the mid-1950s. While living in San Francisco in 1969, he decided to publish his first short-run pamphlet \"Pleasure and Pain\", that would put him in touch with others who shared his interest in enlightenment. The immediate result was that Golas was invited by an enthusiastic Stephen Gaskin to join his famous \"Monday Night Class\" meetings. Thaddeus Golas had gathered his ideas in the form of dense manuscripts, over a twenty-year period, but by 1970, he resolved to use his background as a copy editor for women's magazines to pitch his language on a level that casual readers could easily understand. The writing of his final manuscript of The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment was swift, and took place over a few chaotic and sleepless weeks during which he experienced great pain in his right arm. He would write tirelessly in bursts of prose which included the first sentence of the published text, \"I am a lazy man\". Golas later indicated that he never considered another title for this book, besides The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment. He quickly distributed photocopies of his text hoping to receive feedback, and offering for others to \"do with it what they will,\" but his decision to self-publish resulted from the advice and encouragements of such authors as Alan Watts and Ram Dass.\nThe book was originally intended as a \"trip-guide\" for LSD enthusiasts; it could be used to guide them psychologically and steer them away from \"bummers\". Thaddeus Golas later said he was stunned to see that \"a general audience got off on it.\"\nWhile waiting for delivery of the first edition, Thaddeus Golas created a list of two hundred bookstores, including stores he had visited as a book salesman for Harper and Row in the early 1960s; he wrote every store manager, informing them that the book would be available from the distributor Bookpeople. He also visited bookstores in San Francisco, leaving them with consignment copies. These copies would eventually sell-out in a matter of days. The second printing, at 10,000 copies, sold out in two months. The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment became a rare publishing sensation in the Bay Area.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6157683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6157683", "title": "Theory of everything (philosophy)", "text": "Theory of everything (philosophy)\n\nIn philosophy, a theory of everything or ToE is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation or description of nature or reality. Adopting the term from physics, where the search for a theory of everything is ongoing, philosophers have discussed the viability of the concept and analyzed its properties and implications. Among the questions to be addressed by a philosophical theory of everything are: \"Why is reality understandable?\" \"Why are the laws of nature as they are?\" \"Why is there anything at all?\"\n\nThe \"system building\" style of metaphysics attempts to answer \"all\" the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. Plato and Aristotle could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building \"scope\" of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist \"method\" of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure \"a priori\" reason. Examples from the early modern period include Leibniz's monadology, Descartes's dualism, and Spinoza's monism. Hegel's absolute idealism and Whitehead's process philosophy were later systems. At present, work is underway on the structural-systematic philosophy (SSP), to which the following books are devoted: Lorenz B. Puntel, \"Structure and Being\" (2008; translation of \"Struktur und Sein\", 2006) and \"Being and God\" (2011; translation of \"Sein und Gott\", 2010) and Alan White, \"Toward a Philosophical Theory of Everything\" (2014). The SSP makes no claims to finality; it aims to be the best systematic philosophy currently available.\n\nOther philosophers do not believe philosophy should aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a ToE, for instance Stephen Hawking wrote in \"A Brief History of Time\" that even if we had a ToE, it would necessarily be a set of equations. He wrote, \"What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?\"\n\nIn \"The Price of an Ultimate Theory\", originally published in 2000, Nicholas Rescher specifies what he sees as the principal properties of a Theory of Everything and describes an apparent impasse on the road to such a theory.\n\nFirst, he takes as a presupposition the principle of sufficient reason, which in his formulation states that every fact \"t\" has an explanation \"t\"':\n\nwhere E predicates explanation, so that \"t<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" E \"t\" denotes \"\"t\"' explains \"t\"\".\n\nNext, he asserts that the most direct and natural construction of a Theory of Everything \"T*\" would confer upon it two crucial features: comprehensiveness and finality. Comprehensiveness says that wherever there is a fact \"t\", \"T*\" affords its explanation:\n\nFinality says that as an \"ultimate theory\", \"T*\" has no deeper explanation:\nso that the only conceivable explanation of \"T*\" is \"T*\" itself.\n\nRescher notes that it is obviously problematic to deploy a theory for its own explanation; at the heart of the traditional conception of explanatory adequacy, he says, is a principle of noncircularity stating that no fact can explain itself:\n\nThe impasse is then that the two critical aspects of a Theory of Everything, comprehensiveness and finality, conflict with the fundamental principle of noncircularity. A comprehensive theory which explains everything must explain itself, and a final theory which has no deeper explanation must, by the principle of sufficient reason, have \"some\" explanation; consequently it too must be self-explanatory. Rescher concludes that any Theorist of Everything committed to comprehensiveness and finality is bound to regard noncircularity as \"something that has to be jettisoned\". But how, he asks, can a theory adequately substantiate itself?\n\nRescher's proposal in \"The Price of an Ultimate Theory\" is to dualize the concept of explanation so that a fact can be explained either \"derivationally\", by the premises which lead to it, or \"systemically\", by the consequences which follow from it. With derivational explanation, a fact \"t\" is explained when it is subsumed by some prior, more fundamental fact \"t\"'. With systemic explanation, \"t\" is explained when it is a \"best fit\" for its consequences, where fitness is measured by uniformity, simplicity, connectedness, and other criteria conducive to systemic integration. Rescher concludes that while a theory of everything cannot be explained derivationally (since no deeper explanation can subsume it), it can be explained systemically by its capacity to integrate its consequences.\n\nIn his 1996 book \"The Conscious Mind\", David Chalmers argues that a theory of everything must explain consciousness, that consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical, and that therefore a fundamental theory in physics would not be a theory of everything. A truly final theory, he argues, needs not just physical properties and laws, but phenomenal or protophenomenal properties and psychophysical laws explaining the relationship between physical processes and conscious experience. He concludes that \"[o]nce we have a fundamental theory of consciousness to accompany a fundamental theory in physics, we may truly have a theory of everything.\" Developing such a theory will not be straightforward, he says, but \"it ought to be possible in principle.\"\n\nIn \"Prolegomena to Any Future Philosophy\", a 2002 essay in the \"Journal of Evolution and Technology\", Mark Alan Walker discusses modern responses to the question of how to reconcile \"the apparent finitude of humans\" with what he calls \"the traditional telos of philosophy—the attempt to unite thought and Being, to arrive at absolute knowledge, at a final theory of everything.\" He contrasts two ways of closing this \"gap between the ambitions of philosophy, and the abilities of human philosophers\": a \"deflationary\" approach in which philosophy is \"scaled down into something more human\" and the attempt to achieve a theory of everything is abandoned, and an \"inflationary\", transhumanist approach in which philosophers are \"scaled up\" by advanced technology into \"super-intelligent beings\" better able to pursue such a theory.\n\nIn \"Holistic Explanation and the Idea of a Grand Unified Theory\", originally presented as a lecture in 1998, Rescher identifies two negative reactions to the idea of a unified, overarching theory: reductionism and rejectionism. Reductionism holds that large-scale philosophical issues can be meaningfully addressed only when divided into lesser components, while rejectionism holds that questions about such issues are illegitimate and unanswerable. Against reductionism, Rescher argues that explaining individual parts does not explain the coordinating structure of the whole, so that a collectivized approach is required. Against rejectionism, he argues that the question of the \"reason\" – the \"why\" – behind existence is pressing, important, and not obviously meaningless.\n\n"}
{"id": "230550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230550", "title": "Vanity", "text": "Vanity\n\nVanity is the excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness to others. Prior to the 14th century it did not have such narcissistic undertones, and merely meant \"futility\". The related term vainglory is now often seen as an archaic synonym for \"vanity\", but originally meant \"boasting in vain\", i.e. unjustified boasting; although \"glory\" is now seen as having a predominantly positive meaning, the Latin term from which it derives, \"gloria\", roughly means \"boasting\", and was often used as a negative criticism.\n\nIn many religions, vanity, in its modern sense, is considered a form of self-idolatry in which one likens oneself to the greatness of God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby becomes separated and perhaps in time divorced from the Divine grace of God. In Christian teachings, \"vanity\" is an example of pride, one of the seven deadly sins. Also, in the Bahai Faith, Baha'u'llah uses the term 'vain imaginings'.\n\nPhilosophically, vanity may be a broader form of egotism and pride. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that \"vanity is the fear of appearing original: it is thus a lack of pride, but not necessarily a lack of originality.\" One of Mason Cooley's aphorisms is \"Vanity well fed is benevolent. Vanity hungry is spiteful.\"\n\nIn Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, and in Biblical terms, by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, vanity was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and the figure of death.\n\nSome depictions of vanity include scrolls that read \"Omnia Vanitas\" (\"All is Vanity\"), a quotation from the Latin translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes. Although the term vanitas (Latin, \"emptiness\") originally meant not obsession by one's appearance, but the ultimate fruitlessness of humankind's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture.\n\n\"The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her,\" writes Edwin Mullins, \"while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her.\" The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus.\n\nIn his table of the Seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil; behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier, which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is \"An Allegory of Justice and Vanity\": a young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her. Johannes Vermeer's painting \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, because the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.\n\n\"All is Vanity\", by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror. In the film \"The Devil's Advocate\", Satan (Al Pacino) claims that \"vanity is his favourite sin\".\n\nSuch artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.\n"}
{"id": "30603530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30603530", "title": "What Engineers Know and How They Know It", "text": "What Engineers Know and How They Know It\n\nWhat Engineers Know and How they Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990) () is a historical reflection on engineering practice in US aeronautics from 1908 to 1953 written by an accomplished practitioner and instructor. This period represents the dawn of aviation which was fraught with uncertainties and numerous paths to many possible worlds. The book captures two main conclusions from this period. The first order conclusion of this book is about \"what engineers know.\" Five case studies from the history of aeronautical engineering are used to argue engineering often demands its \"own\" scientific discoveries. Thus, engineering should be understood as a knowledge-generating activity that includes applied science but is not limited to applied science. The second order conclusion of this book pertains to \"how engineers know\" by using the same case studies to reveal patterns in the nature of all engineering. These patterns form an “epistemology” of engineering that may point the way to an “engineering method” as something distinct from scientific method. Walter Vincenti ends the work with a general \"variation-selection model\" for understanding the direction of technological innovation in human history. The book is filled with numerous additional observations and stories told by a practitioner and instructor. This may be why Dr. Michael A. Jackson, author of \"Structured Design\" and \"Problem Frames\", once concluded a keynote address to engineers with the statement, \"Read Vincenti's book. Read it carefully. Read it one hundred times.\"\n\nWalter G. Vincenti (commonly pronounced \"\"vin-sen-tee\" in the US or \"vin-chen-tee\"\" in Italian) (1917–present) is a Professor Emeritus of Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering at Stanford University. In 1987 he was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering, “for pioneering contributions to supersonic aircraft aerodynamics and to fundamental understanding of the physical gas dynamics of hypersonic flow.” His important textbook from the first part of his career is, \"Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics\" (1ed ed 1965, 2nd ed 1975). Vincenti in effect had two whole careers: one as a cutting-edge aeronautical engineer and another as a leading historian of technology. This gave him a dual vantage point to think about how technological innovation works. Further, he broadened the relevance of engineering to society by co-founding a Stanford discipline called Values, Technology and Society in 1971—now called Science, Technology and Society. At the age of 90 he published his most recent work with William M. Newman, \"On an Engineering Use of Engineering History\" which appears in \"Technology and Culture\".\n\n\"What Engineers Know\" was first published in 1990 when Mr. Vincenti was 73 years old after full careers in aerospace engineering, the history of technology, and instructing. The five case studies used for evidence in this book come from the first half of the 20th century, 1908-1953. During this period the author worked at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) from 1940 to 1957. Four of the five case studies used as evidence in this book were first published independently in \"Technology and Culture\" between 1979 and 1986. During this era, other authors were beginning to refute the view of engineering as only applied science. Then in 1990, Vincenti's five case studies indirectly supported this newer discourse about engineering as a knowledge-generating discipline.\n\nThe profession of \"engineering\" encompasses a wide scope of practice. Thus, the author narrows the scope of his five case studies in three ways. First, viewed end-to-end, the engineering process contains three phases including design, construction/production and operation. These cases come largely from the design phase of engineering. One exception is the fifth case study on flush-riveted joints which involved an intimate interplay between design and production. Second, design can be categorized as normal or radical. These case studies pertain to normal design. Third, normal design itself is multi-leveled. These levels proceed from project definition down to overall design, major component design, subdivision of component design, and highly specific problems (like planform, airfoil and high-lift devices). These five case studies come mostly from these lower levels. Thus when combined, the scope of these case studies is design, normal design and highly specific problems at the lowest level, \"to help redress the neglect of this large and essential area.\"\n\nThe five case studies are organized by chapter. Chapter 2 regards airfoil design generally. The early work of Davis illustrates how useful engineering has been done by people who have no formal training in engineering. The Davis wing was instrumental even though Davis did not have the theoretical basis to know how or why. Chapter 3 is about how engineers design in accord with flying qualities satisfactory to pilots. This case study illustrates there can be a key relationship between human behavior and engineering requirements that can greatly affect the outcomes. As such, \"artifactual design is a social activity.\" Chapter 4 instructs the importance of control-volume analysis situations in mechanical design. Control volume analysis was missing in physics textbooks at the time. Thus, engineers had a scientific requirement that was not addressed adequately by any natural science. Importantly, such case studies are examples of why there is such a thing as \"engineering science\". Chapter 5 regards the dynamic problem of propeller design and selection. The propeller case study illustrates how engineers develop methods to account for the absence of required scientific theory. In this case \"parameter variation\" was used to map-out and survey a subject where no comprehensive scientific theory (in physics) existed. Finally, chapter 6 describes the problem of designing flush-riveted joints for aircraft. This case study conveys how requirements of production can have a reverse influence on design thus driving iterations between production and design. This case study also illustrates how there are aspects of engineering that cannot adequately be described as science such as the \"feel\" rivet mechanics developed for how much pressure to apply when completing the aircraft's aluminum stressed-skin structure (see \"tacit knowledge\" discussion below).\n\nThroughout the book, Walter Vincenti makes epistemology observations pertaining to engineering. The following are six of several observations made throughout the book. These observations do not constitute an \"engineering method\" per se but offer a conjecture that they may point the way for further research. He wrote, \"in the final paragraph of chapter 5, I also raised the question of whether it might be profitable to look for \"engineering method\" analogous to but distinguishable from scientific method that has been a fruitful concern for the history of science. Could it be that the variation-selection process outlined here is that method, with its distinctive features lying in the criterion of selection and the vicarious methods used to shortcut direct trial?\"\n\nFirst, there is a pattern to the iterative engineering discovery process seen in the development of flying-quality specifications. This process is referred to as \"Seven Interactive Elements of Engineering Learning\" and includes:\n\n\nThe boldface from the original text isolates the steps in a subject-neutral manner.\n\nSecond, there is a pattern in the very categories of knowledge in engineering.\nThese six categories of engineering knowledge are:\n\nThird, Walter Vincenti sees a pattern in knowledge/science generating activities of engineering.\nThese seven Knowledge-Generating Activities include:\n\nFourth, by placing six categories of knowledge and the seven knowledge-generating activities on an x-y table, these knowledge generating activities cut across the categories of knowledge in a partially predictable way. The resulting table serves as an approximation for what engineering tasks may be likely to produce new engineering knowledge. The resulting diagram \"is intended for discussion more than a set of hard and fast divisions.\"\n\nFifth, he re-classifies engineering knowledge itself. Knowledge generated by engineering may normally be categorized by phases such as design, production or operations. Another way to think about engineering knowledge categories is descriptive knowledge, prescriptive knowledge and tacit knowledge. He adds Gilbert Ryle's terms \"knowing that\" and \"knowing how\" to illustrate the aim of each knowledge category. \"Knowing what or that\" to do in engineering is a mixture of descriptive and prescriptive knowledge. \"Knowing how\" to do it is a mixture of prescriptive and tacit knowledge. Thus, these case studies show the need for all three kinds of knowledge in engineering.\n\nFinally, he posits a variation-selection model for knowledge growth. At all levels of design hierarchy, growth of knowledge acts to increase the complexity and power of the variation-selection process by modifying both the mechanism for variation and expanding the processes of selection vicariously. Variation and selection each add two realistic principles for the advancement of technology: \"blindness\" to variation and \"unsureness\" of selection.\n\nVincenti concludes that our blindness to the vast potential in variations of design does not imply a random or unpremeditated search. A blind person in an unfamiliar alleyway uses a cane to provide information to explore the constraints in an intentional way without having any idea where the alleyway leads. Likewise, engineers proceed in design “blindly” in the sense that “the outcome is not completely foreseeable” thus the “best” potential variations are in some degree invisible. As a result, finding high functioning designs is not the norm. He notes, “from the outside or in retrospect, the entire process tends to seem more ordered and intentional—less blind—than it usually is.”\n\nHowever, Vincenti uses the differences between the Wright brothers and the French to show there is a range in how we manage blindness to variations. The Wright brothers designed a flying machine before the French even though they started experimenting at roughly the same time. The French 1) appealed to what little was known about the Wrights/Langley, 2) mental imaginings of what might succeed, and 3) guidance from growing flight experience. But “since [#1 and #3] were meager, however, the level of blindness, at least at first, was well nigh total.”\n\nWhat was the difference in the process between the Wrights and the French?\n\nThe French trial and error process had less theoretical analysis (or new engineering knowledge). Since, “the French were not inclined toward theoretical analysis, variations could be selected for retention and refinement only by trails in flight.” For the Wrights, advancement of basic principles in theory via analysis lent to precise shortcuts to direct trials making the French process appear more exploratory in retrospect. Thus, the process of selection is aided by 1) theoretical analysis and 2) experiments (in, say, wind tunnels) in place of direct trial of actual (“overt”) versions in the environment. The growth in knowledge increases the power of vicarious trials in place of actual/direct trials.\n\nIn the long term, “the entire variation-selection process—variation and selection together—is filled with uncertainty.” The level of uncertainty is affected by two things. First, “uncertainty comes from the degree of blindness in the variations.” Uncertainty in the whole process decreases as technology matures—he notes that aircraft designers of today operate with more “sure-footedness” than the French of the early 1900s or even his era working at NACA. Yet, there is a paradox in decreasing blindness. While blindness decreases over time, advances simultaneously become more difficult to come by and more sophisticated… which in turn increases blindness! Thus the temptation to see a net decrease in blindesss “stems from an illusion.” The variation-selection process can create as much blindness as it reduces; just ask “talented engineers who struggle to advance a mature technology like present-day aeronautics…”\n\nThe second factor on uncertainty in the whole variation-selection model is “unsureness” in the process of selection. Both vicarious and overt trials suffer from unsureness which adds complication to the variation selection model. But unlike blindness in variation, unsureness in selection decreases with the precision in both kinds of trials.\n\nBlindness and unsureness characterize the difficult or arduous nature of technology evolution in the variation-selection model. The author then reviews the five case studies retrospectively to demonstrate how variation-selection and blindness-unsureness were at work in each case. In total, \"the cumulative growth of engineering knowledge as the result of individual variation-selection processes acts to change the nature of how those processes are carried out.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "55683824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55683824", "title": "Xing Zi Ming Chu", "text": "Xing Zi Ming Chu\n\nXing Zi Ming Chu (), translated as Human Nature Is Brought Forth by Decree or The Inborn-Nature Comes from the Mandate, is a Warring States period (ca. 5th century – 221 BCE) text from the Kingdom of Chu, excavated in 1993 from the Guodian tomb, near Jingmen in Hubei, China. It is one of the earliest Chinese texts to discuss human nature, although it was lost until its re-discovery.\n\n\"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" is part of the Guodian Chu Slips, a corpus of manuscripts written on bamboo slips from the Guodian tomb excavated in 1993, which can be dated to approximately 300 BCE, when the tomb was sealed. This manuscript is one of the longer ones from Guodian, containing about 1,550 characters, written on sixty-seven slips which are long. Nine of the slips have been damaged, leading to a loss of 29 characters.\n\nThe author of \"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" is contested. According to some scholars it was written by Zi Si (483–402 BCE), a grandson of Confucius, based on the similarities in thought between this text and others which he or his disciples are traditionally held to have written, such as \"Zi Yi\" (). However, while acknowledging the likelihood that \"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" and the other Guodian texts circulated during Zi Si's lifetime, other scholars do not find this evidence persuasive, leaving the question of authorship open.\n\nThis bamboo manuscript has a counterpart silk manuscript, named \"Xing Qing Lun\", () or \"Discourse on Human Nature and Unshaped Feelings\", one of the Mawangdui silk texts. Their relationship is a matter of debate. The first halves of each are very similar, and they also feature similar punctuation. Despite that, their second halves diverge, and certain characters do not exactly match. These differences have been interpreted to mean that \"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" is either a version of \"Xing Qing Lun\", or that they share a common textual lineage, but are unlikely to have been copied from one another.\n\n\"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" discusses human nature in the context of the Way and an ethics which would be later viewed as \"Confucian,\" relating it to rightness, benevolence, the mind, and unshaped feelings. It first discusses the origin of human nature in Heaven and humanity. It continues by discussing what causes human nature to manifest, and how it does so. Next, it discusses the education of human nature through \"odes,\" \"documents,\" \"rites,\" and \"music,\" which themselves are said to be refined forms of natural human behaviour. Finally, the text becomes instructive, giving advice for particular situations.\n\n\"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" strongly states that human nature derives from Heaven. This means that human nature is not a blank slate, and merely one of the many things that are born from Heaven's \"decree.\" In its analysis, unshaped feelings derive from human nature; in turn the Way derives from unshaped feelings. The Way in \"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" transcends the phenomenological world, but is yet an innate part of human nature. Therefore humanity is predisposed to cultivation of human nature so as to transform its initial state. To begin with, human nature is characterized as responding to phenomena in the world emotionally. These responses become \"proper\" through ritual, \"i.e.\" the \"odes,\" \"documents,\" \"rites,\" and \"music,\" which had been categorized and organized by \"sages.\" However, there is no evidence in \"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" that these references to tradition refer to specific texts, which is often assumed in the context of early Chinese thought. Rather, the text refers to them as traditions to be performed. Thus humanity is drawn into a web of relations between Heaven, human nature, and moral cultivation, which reflects contemporary philosophical concerns with \"working within and transforming a discontinuous world.\"\n\nScholars note that the concept of human nature set out in \"Xing Zi Ming Chu\" bears similarities with other Warring States texts. As mentioned, it draws on a similar philosophical vocabulary to texts later classed as \"Confucian,\" some of which also discuss human nature, such as \"Mencius\" and \"Xunzi\"). In particular, its discussion of the relationship between unshaped feelings, ritual, and music has been compared to a similar discussion in a chapter of the \"Book of Rites\".
