{"id": "19887961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19887961", "title": "Agora (film)", "text": "Agora (film)\n\nAgora () is a 2009 Spanish English-language historical drama film directed by Alejandro Amenábar and written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil. The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.\n\nThe story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science at the time amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the \"agora\", a public gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman \"forum\". The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of \"The Rise and Fall of Alexandria\" (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.\n\n\"Agora\" was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest-grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.\n\nIn 391 AD, Alexandria is part of the Roman Empire, and Greek philosopher Hypatia is a teacher at the Platonic school, where future leaders are educated. Hypatia is the daughter of Theon, the director of the Musaeum of Alexandria. Hypatia, her father's slave, Davus, and two of her pupils, Orestes and Synesius, are immersed in the changing political and social landscape. She rejects Orestes's love as she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science. He is also secretly in love with her.\n\nMeanwhile, social unrest begins challenging the Roman rule of the city as Pagans and Christians come into conflict. When the Christians start defiling the statues of the pagan gods, the pagans, including Orestes and Theon, ambush the Christians. However, in the ensuing battle, the pagans unexpectedly find themselves outnumbered by a large Christian mob. Theon is gravely injured, and Hypatia and the pagans take refuge in the Library of the Serapeum. The Christian siege of the library ends when an envoy of the Roman Emperor Theodosius I declares that the pagans are pardoned, but the Christians shall be allowed to take possession of the library. Hypatia and the pagans flee while trying to save the most important scrolls before the Christians overtake the library and destroy its contents. Davus chooses to join the Christian forces. He later returns with a gladius and sexually assaults her, but he begins to sob and offers his sword to her. However, she removes his slave collar and tells him that he is free.\n\nSeveral years later, Orestes, now converted to Christianity, is prefect of Alexandria. Hypatia continues to investigate the motions of the Sun, the Moon, the five known \"wanderers\" (planets), and the stars. Some Christians ridicule the thinking that the Earth is a sphere by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus what his opinion is, he avoids conflict by saying that only God knows these things.\n\nHypatia also investigates the heliocentric model of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos by having an object dropped from the mast of a moving ship which demonstrates that a possible motion of the Earth would not affect the motion, relative to Earth, of a falling object on Earth. However, due to religious objections against heliocentrism, the Christians have now forbidden Hypatia to teach at the school. The Christians and the Jews come into violent conflict.\n\nThe leader of the Christians, Cyril, views Hypatia as having too much influence over Orestes and stages a public ceremony intended to force Orestes to subjugate her. Hypatia's former pupil, Synesius, now the Bishop of Cyrene, comes to her rescue as a religious authority counterweight but says he cannot help her unless she accepts Christianity; she refuses. Hypatia theorizes that the Earth orbits around the Sun in an elliptic orbit, not a circular orbit, with the Sun at one of the foci. Cyril convinces a mob of Christians that Hypatia is a witch, and they vow to kill her. Davus tries to run ahead to warn Hypatia, but she is captured. They strip Hypatia and are about to skin her alive until Davus persuades the mob otherwise, and they decide to stone her instead. When the mob goes outside to collect stones, Davus suffocates her to spare her the pain of being stoned and tells the mob that she fainted. Davus leaves as they begin to stone her.\n\n\nAfter Amenábar completed \"The Sea Inside\" (2004), he took a break and traveled to the island of Malta, where he used his free time to explore the night sky. Seeing the Milky Way galaxy, Amenábar began to discuss astronomy with his friends, speculating about extraterrestrial life on other planets. He started to research astronomy and came across \"\", by American astronomer Carl Sagan. Amenábar also studied historical figures such as Ptolemy, Copernicus, Johannes Kepler and Galileo, but found himself most interested in the story of Hypatia, a 4th-century Greek astronomer whose history, he felt, was still relevant in the 21st century: \"We realized that this particular time in the world had a lot of connections with our contemporary reality. Then the project became really, really intriguing, because we realized that we could make a movie about the past while actually making a movie about the present.\"\n\nTo prepare for the task of recreating the ancient city of Alexandria without relying on computer generated imagery, Amenábar reviewed older sword-and-sandal films such as \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), and \"Pharaoh\" (1966). A year before the start of pre-production, designer Guy Hendrix Dyas spent three weeks with Amenábar in Madrid to do some preliminary work on the set designs and the recreation of the ancient city of Alexandria so that previs animations could be generated.\n\nThe film was produced by Fernando Bovaira, with Telecinco Cinema as the primary producer along with Mod Producciones, Himenoptero, and Sogecable as co-producers.\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 17, 2008, on the island of Malta, and was scheduled to last 15 weeks. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas used large sets on location instead of computer generated imagery at Amenábar's direction. The construction of the set employed almost 400 people, and was the largest ever designed on the island. Actor Charles Thake (Hesiquius) suffered minor facial injuries on the set when he collided with extras running during a scene. Filming ended in June.\n\n\"Agora\" premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, but the film was initially unable to find a domestic distributor due to its large budget and length. The film also had trouble finding a distributor in both the United States and Italy, although it eventually found distributors in both countries. The North America premiere was held at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, 2009. \"Agora\" opened in Spain on October 9, 2009, breaking box office records for that country. A limited release in the United States began on May 28, 2010, opening on two screens at the Paris Theatre and the Sunshine Cinema in New York City. The film opened on the West Coast of the United States on June 4, playing only two screens: at The Landmark theatre in Los Angeles and at Regal's Westpark 8 in Irvine.\n\nIn March 2010, \"Agora\" was released in Region 2-locked DVD and Blu-ray formats. A Region 1-locked DVD was released October 2010.\n\nBritish writer and film critic Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" praised Alejandro Amenábar and his film, describing \"Agora\" as \"an ambitious, cerebral and complex movie... Unlike most toga movies, it doesn't rely on CGI spectacle, but real drama and ideas.\" Bradshaw also applauded Rachel Weisz's role as Hypatia, calling it \"an outstanding performance\".\nAmerican screenwriter and critic Roger Ebert liked the film and gave it three stars out of four. He said: \"I went to see \"Agora\" expecting an epic with swords, sandals and sex. I found swords and sandals, some unexpected opinions about sex, and a great deal more.\"\n\nThe film holds a 52% 'Rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 87 reviews.\n\nBefore its release, the distribution company insisted on screening the film at the Vatican. No objections were reported and Vatican officials assisted in some of the religious depictions. According to Amenábar, \"There’s one scene in which Cyril reads from St. Paul and [the Vatican] tried to look for the softest version. In the English version, [it is] taken from the King James version of the Bible.\" The line is excerpted from .\n\nThe Religious Anti-Defamation Observatory (Observatorio Antidifamación Religiosa), a Spanish Catholic group, claimed that the film was responsible for \"promoting hatred of Christians and reinforcing false clichés about the Catholic Church.\" Michael Ordoña of the \"Los Angeles Times\" acknowledges that the film has been criticized for \"perceived slights against Christians\" but that \"its lack of condemnation of specific dogma makes the film's target seem to be fundamentalism in general\".\n\nIn contrast, the New York-based Rev. Philip Grey wrote a positive review of the film and strongly recommended it: \"Christians who see themselves in the fanatic, murderous monks of the film and feel offended need to do some serious soul-searching.(...) Hypatia as depicted in the film is firmly opposed to what, in her time and at her city, is offered—or rather, imposed by brute force—under the name of 'Christianity'. Nevertheless, she seems to me far more a follower of the precepts of Christianity than are her persecutors and tormentors.(...) In particular, in watching the deeply moving final scene, her going calmly to her death amidst the jeering mob, I could not help but strongly recall Jesus Christ on his own way to Golgotha\".\n\n\"Agora\" was Spain's highest-grossing film of 2009, earning over $10.3 million within four days of its release on October 9.\n\nBased on North American theatre tracking data from Rentrak Theatrical, \"indieWIRE\" reported that \"Agora\" \"scored the highest per-theater-average of any film in the marketplace\" during the Memorial Day holiday weekend from May 28 through May 31, just after its U.S. limited release. Despite this very high per-theater average, \"Agora\" was never widely released in the United States. According to Box Office Mojo, its widest release in the United States was just 17 theaters.\n\nThe film grossed over $32.3 million (€21.4 million) by 1 December 2009, and about $35 million by 1 February 2010. As of 10 January 2011, \"Agora\"'s worldwide box office earnings were approximately $39 million. DVD and Blu-ray sales numbers are not publicly available.\n\n\"Agora\" was nominated for 13 Goya Awards, winning 7. The film won the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize ($25,000 USD) in 2009 at the Hamptons International Film Festival.\n\n, a Spanish astrophysicist and one of \"Agora\"'s scientific advisors, stated in an interview that \"We know that Hypatia lived in Alexandria in the IV and V centuries CE, until her death in 415. Only three primary sources mention Hypatia of Alexandria, apart from other secondary ones\". He added that none of Hypatia's work has survived but it is thought, from secondary sources, that her main fields of study and work were geometry and astronomy. Mampaso claimed that Hypatia invented the hydrometer, an instrument still in use today, and that probably her father Theon of Alexandria, together with Hypatia, invented the astrolabe. However, it is generally accepted that the astrolabe had already been invented a couple of centuries earlier, and that the instrument was known to the Greeks before the Christian era. Similarly, the hydrometer was invented before Hypatia, and already known in her time. In this regard, Pappus of Alexandria was recorded as using the hydrometer before Hypatia was even born. Synesius sent Hypatia a letter describing a hydrometer, and requesting her to have one constructed for him. There is no evidence that the historical Hypatia ever studied the heliocentric model proposed by Aristarchus of Samos or that she ever found any evidence to support it.\n\nThe set used in the film is meticulously historically authentic, showing a blend of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian architectural styles that would have been fitting to the time period, but the costumes are anachronistic. The Roman soldiers are shown wearing generic armor and weapons resembling the type used in the first century AD, but the film is actually set in the fifth century AD, by which time Roman troops no longer wore leather armor and would have instead worn scale armor or chain mail.\n\nThe film contains a scene, based on the final episode of Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\", in which Christians burn the \"Great Library of Alexandria\", but the historical Library of Alexandria had actually ceased to exist in any recognizable form centuries before Hypatia was even born. The last references to anyone having held membership in the Mouseion (the larger research institute which contained the library) date to the 260s AD. Theon was the head of a school called the \"Mouseion\", but it was a different school named after the Hellenistic Mouseion. Although Christians under the decree of the bishop Theophilus did destroy the Serapeum of Alexandria in 391 AD, which, at one time, had housed scrolls from the Library of Alexandria, the Serapeum probably no longer had any scrolls in it at the time of its destruction, since sources prior to 391 speak of its libraries in the past tense. Also, the Christians completely demolished the Serapeum to the ground, leaving no part of its structure intact; whereas, in the film, they merely knock over all the statues and burn the (probably nonexistent) scrolls. \"Agora\" also strongly implies that Hypatia was an atheist, which directly contradicts the historical fact that she was a Neoplatonist follower of the teachings of Plotinus, who believed that the goal of philosophy was \"a mystical union with the divine.\"\n\nRobert Barron, an American Catholic priest, writes in an article: \"Hypatia was indeed a philosopher and she was indeed killed by a mob in 415, but practically everything else about the story that Gibbon and Sagan and Amenábar tell is false\". Irene A. Artemi, a doctor of theology at Athens University, states that \"The movie—albeit seemingly not turning against the Christian religion—is in fact portraying the Christians as fundamentalist, obscurantist, ignorant and fanatic\". Similarly, the atheist historian Tim O'Neil remarks: \"Over and over again, elements are added to the story that are not in the source material: the destruction of the library, the stoning of the Jews in the theatre, Cyril condemning Hypatia's teaching because she is a woman, the heliocentric \"breakthrough\" and Hypatia's supposed irreligiosity.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at Duke University. He is also a novelist.\n\nRosenberg attended the City College of New York where he graduated with a B.A. in 1967. He received his Ph.D. from the Johns Hopkins University in 1971. He won the Lakatos Award in 1993 and was the National Phi Beta Kappa Romanell Lecturer in 2006.\n\nRosenberg is an atheist, and a metaphysical naturalist.\n\nRosenberg's early work focused on the philosophy of social science and especially the philosophy of economics. His doctoral dissertation, published as \"Microeconomic Laws\" in 1976, was the first treatment of the nature of economics by a contemporary philosopher of science. Over the period of the next decade he became increasingly skeptical about neoclassical economics as an empirical theory.\n\nHe later shifted to work on issues in the philosophy of science that are raised by biology. He became especially interested in the relationship between molecular biology and other parts of biology. Rosenberg introduced the concept of supervenience to the treatment of intertheoretical relations in biology, soon after Donald Davidson began to exploit Richard Hare's notion in the philosophy of psychology. Rosenberg is among the few biologists and fewer philosophers of science who reject the consensus view that combines physicalism with antireductionism (see his 2010 on-line debate with John Dupré at Philosophy TV).\n\nRosenberg also coauthored an influential book on David Hume with Tom Beauchamp, \"Hume and the Problem of Causation\", arguing that Hume was not a skeptic about induction but an opponent of rationalist theories of inductive inference.\n\nRosenberg’s treatment of fitness as a supervenient property, which is an undefined concept in the theory of natural selection, is criticized by Brandon and Beatty. His original development of how the supervenience of Mendelian concepts blocks traditional derivational reduction was examined critically by C. Kenneth Waters. His later account of reduction in developmental biology was criticized by Günter Wagner. Elliott Sober's \"Multiple realization arguments against reductionism\" reflects a shift towards Rosenberg's critique of anti-reductionist arguments of Putnam's and Fodor's.\n\nSober has also challenged Rosenberg’s view that the principle of natural selection is the only biological law.\n\nThe explanatory role of the principle of natural selection and the nature of evolutionary probabilities defended by Rosenberg were subject to counter arguments by Brandon and later by Denis Walsh. Rosenberg's account of the nature of genetic drift and the role of probability in the theory of natural selection draws on significant parallels between the principle of natural selection and the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn the philosophy of social science, Rosenberg’s more skeptical views about microeconomics were challenged first by Wade Hands and later by Daniel Hausman in several books and articles. The financial crisis of 2008–09 resulted in renewed attention to Rosenberg's skeptical views about microeconomics. Biologist Richard Lewontin and historian Joseph Fracchia express skepticism about Rosenberg’s claim that functional explanations in social science require Darwinian underlying mechanisms.\n\nIn 2011 Rosenberg published a defense of what he called \"Scientism\"—the claim that \"the persistent questions\" people ask about the nature of reality, the purpose of things, the foundations of value and morality, the way the mind works, the basis of personal identity, and the course of human history, could all be answered by the resources of science. This book was attacked on the front cover of The New Republic by Leon Wieseltier as \"The worst book of the year\". Leon Wiseltier's claim, in turn, was critiqued as exaggeration by Philip Kitcher in The New York Times Book Review. On February 1, 2013, Rosenberg debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig over the topics discussed in \"The Atheist's Guide to Reality.\"\n\nRosenberg has contributed articles to \"The New York Times\" Op/Ed series The Stone, on naturalism, science and the humanities, and meta-ethics, and the mind's powers to understand itself by introspection that arise from the views he advanced in \"The Atheist's Guide to Reality.\"\n\nRosenberg’s 2015 novel, \"The Girl From Krakow\", Lake Union Publishing, is a narrative about a young woman named Rita Feuerstahl from 1935 to 1947, mainly focusing on her struggles to survive in Nazi-occupied Poland and later in Germany, under a false identity. A secondary plot involves her lover’s experiences in France and Spain during its Civil War in the 1930s and then in Moscow during the war. Rosenberg has acknowledged that the novel is based on the wartime experiences of people he knew. He has also admitted the incongruity of writing a narrative, given his attack on the form in \"The Atheist’s Guide to Reality\". He has said that \"The Girl from Krakow\" began as an attempt to put some of the difficult arguments of \"The Atheist’s Guide to Reality\" into a form easier to grasp\". \"The Girl From Krakow\" has been translated into Italian, Hungarian, Polish and Hebrew.\n\nIn 2016 Rosenberg’s second novel, \"Autumn in Oxford\", appeared, also published by Lake Union Publishing. An afterword identifies the large number of real persons—academics, civil rights advocates, military officers, politicians and intelligence agents from the 1940s and '50s who figure in the narrative.\n\nIn 2018 Rosenberg published ’‘How History Gets Things Wrong: The Neuroscience of our Addiction to Stories’‘ This work develops the eliminative materialism of ‘‘The Atheist’s guide to Reality‘‘ applying it to the role ‘the theory of mind’ plays in history and other forms of story telling. Rosenberg argues that the work of Nobel Prize winners, Eric Kandel, John O'Keefe and May-Britt Moser along with Edvard Moser reveals that the ‘‘theory of mind‘‘ employed in every day life and narrative history has no basis in the organization of the brain. Evidence from evolutionary anthropology, child psychology, medical diagnosis and neural imaging reveals it is an innate or almost innate tool that arose in Hominini evolution to foster collaboration among small numbers of individuals in immediate contact over the near future, but whose predictive weakness beyond this domain reveals its explanatory emptiness. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "6395956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6395956", "title": "Analytic–synthetic distinction", "text": "Analytic–synthetic distinction\n\nThe analytic–synthetic distinction (also called the analytic–synthetic dichotomy) is a semantic distinction, used primarily in philosophy to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: analytic propositions and synthetic propositions. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world. However, philosophers have used the terms in very different ways. Furthermore, philosophers have debated whether there is a legitimate distinction.\n\nThe philosopher Immanuel Kant uses the terms \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781/1998, A6–7/B10–11). There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative subject-predicate judgments and defines \"analytic proposition\" and \"synthetic proposition\" as follows:\n\nExamples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:\n\nKant's own example is:\n\nEach of these statements is an affirmative subject-predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is \"contained\" within the subject concept. The concept \"bachelor\" contains the concept \"unmarried\"; the concept \"unmarried\" is part of the definition of the concept \"bachelor\". Likewise, for \"triangle\" and \"has three sides\", and so on.\n\nExamples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:\n\nKant's own example is:\n\nAs with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept \"bachelor\" does not contain the concept \"alone\"; \"alone\" is not a part of the \"definition\" of \"bachelor\". The same is true for \"creatures with hearts\" and \"have kidneys\"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept \"creature with a heart\" does not contain the concept \"has kidneys\".\n\nIn the Introduction to the \"Critique of Pure Reason\", Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between \"a priori\" and \"a posteriori\" propositions. He defines these terms as follows:\n\nExamples of \"a priori\" propositions include:\n\nThe justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether . (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts \"bachelor\", \"unmarried\", \"7\", \"+\" and so forth. However, the \"a priori\" / \"a posteriori\" distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the \"origins\" of the concepts but to the \"justification\" of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.)\n\nExamples of \"a posteriori\" propositions include:\n\nBoth of these propositions are \"a posteriori\": any justification of them would require one's experience.\n\nThe analytic/synthetic distinction and the \"a priori\" / \"a posteriori\" distinction together yield four types of propositions:\n\nKant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory. Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological frameworkeach, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, \"analytic\", \"synthetic a priori\", and \"empirical\" or \"a posteriori\" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible.\n\nPart of Kant's argument in the Introduction to the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. To know an analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one needs merely to take the subject and \"extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate\" (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, to know an analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true.\n\nThus, for example, one need not consult experience to determine whether \"All bachelors are unmarried\" is true. One need merely examine the subject concept (\"bachelors\") and see if the predicate concept \"unmarried\" is contained in it. And in fact, it is: \"unmarried\" is part of the definition of \"bachelor\" and so is contained within it. Thus the proposition \"All bachelors are unmarried\" can be known to be true without consulting experience.\n\nIt follows from this, Kant argued, first: All analytic propositions are \"a priori\"; there are no \"a posteriori\" analytic propositions. It follows, second: There is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions; we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true.\n\nAfter ruling out the possibility of analytic \"a posteriori\" propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic \"a priori\" propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic \"a posteriori\" propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic \"a priori\" propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic \"a priori\" propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic \"a priori\" propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic \"a priori\" propositions is possible.\n\nOver a hundred years later, a group of philosophers took interest in Kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions: the logical positivists.\n\nPart of Kant's examination of the possibility of synthetic \"a priori\" knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions, such as\n\nKant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic \"a priori\" propositions, and that we know them. That they are synthetic, he thought, is obvious: the concept \"equal to 12\" is not contained within the concept \"7 + 5\"; and the concept \"straight line\" is not contained within the concept \"the shortest distance between two points\". From this, Kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic \"a priori\" propositions.\n\nGottlob Frege's notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment: symmetry, transitivity, antonymy, or negation and so on. He had a strong emphasis on formality, in particular formal definition, and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms. \"All bachelors are unmarried\" can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as \"unmarried man\" to form \"All unmarried men are unmarried\", which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form: any statement of the form \"All \"X\" that are (\"F\" and \"G\") are \"F\"\". Using this particular expanded idea of analyticity, Frege concluded that Kant's examples of arithmetical truths are analytical \"a priori\" truths and \"not\" synthetic \"a priori\" truths.\n\nThe logical positivists agreed with Kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths, and further that mathematical propositions are \"a priori\". However, they did not believe that any complex metaphysics, such as the type Kant supplied, are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths. Instead, the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like \"all bachelors are unmarried\" and our knowledge of mathematics (and logic) are in the basic sense the same: all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language.\n\nThus the logical positivists drew a new distinction, and, inheriting the terms from Kant, named it the \"analytic/synthetic distinction\". They provided many different definitions, such as the following:\n\nSynthetic propositions were then defined as:\n\nThese definitions applied to all propositions, regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form. Thus, under these definitions, the proposition \"It is raining or it is not raining\" was classified as analytic, while for Kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form. And the proposition \"\" was classified as analytic, while under Kant's definitions it was synthetic.\n\nTwo-dimensionalism is an approach to semantics in analytic philosophy. It is a theory of how to determine the sense and reference of a word and the truth-value of a sentence. It is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time, namely: How is it possible to discover empirically that a necessary truth is true? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by Robert Stalnaker, but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including David Chalmers and Berit Brogaard.\n\nAny given sentence, for example, the words,\n\nis taken to express two distinct propositions, often referred to as a \"primary intension\" and a \"secondary intension\", which together compose its meaning.\n\nThe primary intension of a word or sentence is its sense, i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of \"water\" might be a description, such as \"watery stuff\". The thing picked out by the primary intension of \"water\" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take \"water\" to mean \"watery stuff\", but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not HO, it is not the case that water is HO for that world.\n\nThe \"secondary intension\" of \"water\" is whatever thing \"water\" happens to pick out in \"this\" world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign \"water\" the primary intension \"watery stuff\" then the secondary intension of \"water\" is HO, since HO is \"watery stuff\" in this world. The secondary intension of \"water\" in our world is HO, which is HO in every world because unlike \"watery stuff\" it is impossible for HO to be other than HO. When considered according to its secondary intension, \"Water is HO\" is true in every world.\n\nIf two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. Saul Kripke has argued that \"Water is HO\" is an example of the \"necessary a posteriori\", since we had to discover that water was HO, but given that it is true, it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not HO, for these are known to be \"identical\".\n\nRudolf Carnap was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called \"internal questions\", questions entertained within a \"framework\" (like a mathematical theory), and \"external questions\", questions posed outside any framework – posed before the adoption of any framework. The \"internal\" questions could be of two types: \"logical\" (or analytic, or logically true) and \"factual\" (empirical, that is, matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework). The \"external\" questions were also of two types: those that were confused pseudo-questions (\"one disguised in the form of a theoretical question\") and those that could be re-interpreted as practical, pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was \"more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended\". The adjective \"synthetic\" was not used by Carnap in his 1950 work \"Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology\". Carnap did define a \"synthetic truth\" in his work \"Meaning and Necessity\": a sentence that is true, but not simply because \"the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth\".\n\nThe notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is, whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone. Thus, what Carnap calls internal \"factual\" statements (as opposed to internal \"logical\" statements) could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require \"observations\", but some external statements also could be \"synthetic\" statements and Carnap would be doubtful about their status. The analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the internal–external distinction.\n\nIn 1951, Willard Van Orman Quine published the essay \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable. The argument at bottom is that there are no \"analytic\" truths, but all truths involve an empirical aspect. In the first paragraph, Quine takes the distinction to be the following:\n\nQuine's position denying the analytic-synthetic distinction is summarized as follows:\nTo summarize Quine's argument, the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy, but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact – synthetic propositions. Thus, there is no non-circular (and so no tenable) way to ground the notion of analytic propositions.\n\nWhile Quine's rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known, the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy. However, some (for example, Boghossian) argue that Quine's rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers, even if for poor reasons.\n\nPaul Grice and P. F. Strawson criticized \"Two Dogmas\" in their 1956 article \"In Defense of a Dogma\". Among other things, they argue that Quine's skepticism about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask \"What does it mean?\". If it makes sense to ask \"What does it mean?\", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question \"What does it mean?\" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book \"Word and Object\" was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of indeterminacy of translation.\n\nIn \"Speech Acts\", John Searle argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria, it does not follow that the notion itself is void. Considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria, which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements, it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity.\n\nIn \"'Two Dogmas' Revisited\", Hilary Putnam argues that Quine is attacking two different notions:\nAnalytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a tautology by putting synonyms for synonyms is near Kant's account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what, however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of \"a priori\". While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it.\n\nJerrold Katz, a one-time associate of Noam Chomsky, countered the arguments of \"Two Dogmas\" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.\n\nIn \"Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis\", Scott Soames has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:\n\nIt is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published \"Two Dogmas\". Today, however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. He says: \"Very few philosophers today would accept either [of these assertions], both of which now seem decidedly antique.\"\n\nPhilosopher Leonard Peikoff, in his essay \"The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy\", expands upon Ayn Rand's analysis. He posits that:\n\nThe theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logical argument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logic cannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of your \"concepts\", then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal to your \"percepts\", then you cannot be certain of it.\n\nTo Peikoff, the critical question is: What is included in the meaning of a concept? He rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concept's referents are excluded from the concept. Applying Rand's theory that a concept is a \"mental integration\" of similar existents, treated as \"units\", he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual existents, including all their characteristics, not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept. He states,\n\nSince a concept is an integration of units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a concept consists of the units — the existents — which it integrates, including all the characteristics of these units... The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept.\n\nFurthermore, he argues that there is no valid distinction between \"necessary\" and \"contingent\" facts, and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process: the application of logic to perceptual data. Associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that Objectivism also regards as false and artificial, such as logical truth vs. factual truth, logically possible vs. empirically possible, and a priori vs. the a posteriori.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41791650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41791650", "title": "Apostolic Pastoral Congress", "text": "Apostolic Pastoral Congress\n\nThe Apostolic Pastoral Congress or \"Apostolic Pastoral Congress of Great Britain\" (Conventum Apostolicae Pastoralis Magnae Britanniae) is a collegiate collective of Christian bishops, pastors and other clergy in Great Britain. It is part of the Pentecostal Holiness movement. Its bishops claim apostolic succession.\n\nThe Apostolic Pastoral Congress is one of the forty-three \"member-denominations\" that together make up the membership of England's national ecumenical instrument: Churches Together in England. The Congress is also a member of Churches Together in Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe presiding prelate and executive director of the Congress is Archbishop Doyé Agama. Archbishop Agama served as a trustee of Churches Together in England from March 2010 to November 2018. He is a past co-president of Greater Manchester Churches Together, and he was the moderator of the Forum of Churches Together in England between 2012 and 2015.\n\nThe Congress is listed in the UK Directory of Black & Multicultural Churches. However, the movement also includes several Asian churches and small numbers of white British churches as well.\n\nThe Congress is a member of the Evangelical Alliance of Great Britain.\n\nThe Congress was formed (initially under the name \"Apostolic Pastoral Association\") during the first decade of the 21st century. It started in the north of England and now has country-wide membership. The Congress remains particularly active in Greater Manchester and the surrounding areas, and has its administrative office at Manchester.\n\nIn 2013, the presiding prelate of the Congress was elevated to the status of archbishop, at a ceremony held in Southwark Cathedral at London Bridge in central London, England.\n\nThe Congress is Pentecostal in character, firmly evangelical in its soteriology, sacramental in theology and practice. members of the Congress use adapted forms of ancient church liturgy whenever sacraments are expressed, but at other times allow more open styles of Pentecostal worship. As such, it may be identified as being part of the Convergence Movement.\n\nThe Congress also promotes knowledge of and respect for the ancient Christian church of the first millennium in the British Isles, and indeed knowledge of and respect for the ancient Christian church worldwide, and encourages disciplined prayer life based on insights derived from the early monastics.\n\nCongress policy is to preach and practice Holy Baptism by full immersion in water, following confession of faith in Jesus Christ and a personal infilling of the Holy Spirit, evidenced by the biblical gifts (see spiritual gift) and fruit of the Holy Spirit. Congress is dedicated to promoting holy living which is the right result of salvation in Christ.\n\nThere is particular emphasis upon the spiritual heritage deriving from early monastic communities such as those at Whithorn (Candida Casa) (see St Ninian of Whithorn) in Galloway, Scotland, Iona and Lindisfarne and from the seventh century north African (Berber) scholar-monk Hadrian of Canterbury (Adrian of Canterbury) (Hadrian the African) (c.635 - 710) and Antony of Egypt.\n\nThere is particular focus upon the African and Asian diaspora community in the Atlantic Isles and upon BAME (Black, Asian and other minority ethnic) community interests and affairs generally.\n\nBishops are listed alphabetically by surname. The list is not necessarily exhaustive. Where known, the date of admission into the APC House of Bishops is indicated in parentheses. \n\nIn addition, bishops who are not members of the APC House of Bishops but who are associated with APC and whose sphere of ministry is believed to be wholly or mainly outside the United Kingdom are listed below. Where known, the date on which the bishop became associated with APC is indicated in parentheses. Again the information is provisional and is not necessarily exhaustive.\n\nFor several years now, the Congress has organized and hosted an annual conference or \"Pentecostal Summit\" in an English cathedral, usually Manchester Cathedral, though in 2013 Southwark Cathedral was used. This event is combined with the Congress's annual ordination ceremony, and also with awards by the Apostolic Order of St Hadrian of Canterbury (see below).\n\nThe Congress provides training, mentoring, networking, ordination and licensing.\n\nTraining provision is mainly through St Hadrian's College.\n\nThis is a group of Christian churches mainly in or around the Manchester area of England. The Congress's current Presiding Prelate is also Senior Pastor of the Christian Way of Life Churches. While the \"Christian Way of Life Churches\" and the Congress are distinct organizations, there is close synergy between them.\n\nThe Noble Communion and Holy Apostolic Order of St Hadrian of Canterbury is another organization very closely linked with the Congress. The Order declares itself to be a Pentecostal Christian and educational Order. The Order has as its grand patron Prince Ermias Sahle Selassie Haile Selassie. Prince Ermias is a grandson of the Emperor Haile Selassie (1892-1975), and president of Ethiopia's Crown Council (a council in exile). The Order aims to promote aspects of monastic prayer life within black Pentecostal Christian churches. The Order grants awards to individuals in recognition of outstanding service, and particularly recognizes outstanding community service by Christians from black and other minority ethnic backgrounds in the United Kingdom and beyond.\n\nAmong those who have been granted awards by the Order are Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, Bishop Nigel McCulloch, and Bishop David Walker.\n\nThis is the international arm of the organization and it is particularly active in Africa.\n\nIt has been said that there are close relations between the Church of England and the Apostolic Pastoral Congress. This is exemplified by the fact that the Congress's presiding prelate leads a church that operates in Church of England church buildings, that Church of England bishops attend and participate in the Congress's Annual Pentecostal Summit, that a greeting from the archbishop of Canterbury was read at the 2013 Summit, and that the Summit and the Congress's ordinations take place within Church of England cathedrals.\n\nThe Congress is a designated church under the provisions of the Church of England's Ecumenical Relations Measure.\n\nThe Congress is a member of Churches Together in England. The Congress's current (2014) presiding prelate is a member of the board of directors/trustees of Churches Together in England and he is moderator for the three year period 2012 to 2015 of the Forum of Churches Together in England.\n\nThe Congress's presiding prelate is a former member of this Joint College. He is also a member of the House of Bishops of the Pentecostal Churches of Christ (based in USA). \n\nIn 2013, the Consecration Mandate for elevating the Congress's presiding prelate, (Bishop (now Archbishop) Doyé Agama), to the status of archbishop was provided by J. Delano Ellis who is presiding prelate of the Joint College and also of the Pentecostal Churches of Christ. Archbishop Ellis also sent an episcopal delegation (comprising Bishop Darryl Woodson and Bishop Benjamin Douglass) from USA to London to take the lead role in the ceremony of elevation. Bishops Woodson and Douglass are bishops among the Pentecostal Churches of Christ.\n\nBishop Duke Akamisoko (Church of Nigeria) was one of the bishops who laid hands upon the Congress's presiding prelate Doye Agama, at the ceremony in London on 19 October 2013 elevating Bishop Agama to the status of archbishop. \n\nChurch of Nigeria is a church within the worldwide Anglican Communion. \n\nWebsite of Apostolic Pastoral Congress http://www.apostolicpastors.info \n\nWebsite of the principal congregation of the Christian Way of Life Churches http://www.wayoflifechurch.co.uk \n\nWebsite of Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops http://www.collegeofbishops.org \n\nWebsite of UK Directory of Black & Multicultural Churches http://www.blackmajoritychurches.co.uk \n\nChurches Together in England - website http://www.cte.org.uk \n\nApostolic Congress of Great Britain - website . \"Disambiguation: Apostolic Congress of Great Britain (an organization founded by Bishop Henry Paul Kontor and based at Ilford, Essex, England) is not the same organization as Apostolic Pastoral Congress (or Apostolic Pastoral Congress of Great Britain)\".\n\n\"An Apostolic Handbook - Volume One - Guidance on Faith and Order in the Apostolic Pastoral Congress\" (191 pages) author: Agama,DT publisher: FastPrint Publishing, Peterborough, England 2015 \n"}

It was founded in 1981 by Ravi Shankar. The Art of Living Foundation has centers in more than 156 countries.\n\nThe Foundation is working in special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations. The International Association for Human Values is a partner NGO that Shankar founded, that focuses on the upliftment of human values at the grassroots level.\n\nArt of Living Foundation (AOL) has its international headquarters in Bangalore, India at Ved Vignan Mahavidyapeeth or VVM campus (usually referred to as The Art of Living International Center or the Bangalore Ashram) and has regional centers in more than 150 countries. In Europe, the organization is known as the Association for Inner Growth. The Foundation was founded by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, and offers a variety of personal-development and trauma-relief programs around the world.\n\nAOL has been an educational and humanitarian organization in the U.S. since 1989. Accredited as a United Nations non-governmental organization in 1996, it works in special consultative status with the UN's Economic and Social Council, participating in a variety of committees and activities relating to health, education, sustainable development, conflict resolution, and disaster relief. The Art of Living is a DPI NGO (Department of Public Information), which means it plays an active role in communicating and contributing to various United Nations goals (such as the UN Millennium Goals and the Stand Up initiative).\n\nThe majority of the officers of the organization, along with most of its teachers and staff, are volunteers. Many humanitarian programs, disaster relief efforts, and training programs are conducted through, or in conjunction with partner organization, the International Association for Human Values (IAHV). Some of the key worldwide chapters include the Art of Living Foundation (U.S.A.), Vyakti Vikas Kendra (India), Die Kunst des Lebens (Germany), Art of Living Center (Canada), Art of Living South Africa, Art of Living Israel, Art of Living Brazil, and Art of Living Argentina.\n\nThe Foundation operates as a charitable organization actively conducting \"Art of Living\" stress-relief courses, based on yoga, breathing, and meditation.\n\nGuided by Sri Sri’s philosophy of peace, \"Unless we have a stress-free mind and a violence-free society, we cannot achieve world peace\", the Art of Living offers several stress-elimination and self-development programmes based mainly on breathing techniques, meditation and yoga. Art of living hopeline, a telephonic hotline available 24/7, is a dedicated program to reduce suicidal tendencies.\n\nThe organization is involved in community service through its centres, and programs are taken by people of many traditions and religious backgrounds. Its underlying principles are compatible with Vedic philosophy.\n\nIn March 2014, the organization's yoga center in Islamabad, Pakistan was burned down followed by reports of threats issued to the organization by Taliban.\n\nAccording to the tax return filed by the American chapter, AOL Foundation had total revenues of $US5.5 million mainly $US3.5 million from course fees and $US1.7 million from public support ) and expenditure of $US3.6 million from July 2006 to June 2007. Net assets at the beginning of July 2007 amounted to $US7.7 million. EIN for the American chapter of AOL Foundation is 77-0240101.\n\nArt of Living is engaged in many social services globally. Its areas of work covers conflict resolution, disaster and trauma relief, poverty alleviation, empowerment of women, prisoner rehabilitation, education for all, campaigns against female foeticide and child labour and environment sustainability.\n\nIn 2007, the foundation initiated the 'Project Vidarbha - 'Swavalamban programme'. The aim was to support, train and encourage farmers in severe drought hit regions to roll back their lives. Over 1000 volunteers provided training in organic farming, zero-budget farming, rainwater harvesting, hygiene, construction of toilets, etc. in addition to the Art of Living course. The program received official backing as a result of its success and was initiated in other areas as well. The foundation received Rs 1.4 million funding from the state Government compared with its total expenditure of nearly Rs 7.5 million, some of which was self-financed, most of it was raised from its corporate donors. A similar initiative was started to educate farmers in Andhra Pradesh to implement 'zero budget farming' to end suicides.\n\nIn partnership with United Nations Millennium Campaign and United Nations Environment Programme the 'Mission Green Earth Stand Up Take Action' campaign was launched in 2008 with a goal to plant 100 million trees across the world to help reduce global warming and protect the environment. Art of Living had already started tree plantations across India as part of its Mission Green Earth campaign to support the Millennium Development Goals of the UN. In 2010, in Bangladesh the foundation participated in the 'Billion Tree Campaign' started by United Nations Environment Programme.\n\nA three-year program to rejuvenate the Kumudavathi river (in Bangalore) was initiated by the foundation under its 'Volunteer for Better India' campaign in collaboration with civic authorities and environmentalists in February 2013. \"The project aims to address the water shortage problems through rainwater harvesting, increasing green cover and desilting existing step wells, among other methods.\" Volunteers join the villagers every Sunday to participate in these activities under guidance of a geological scientist. To create awareness about this program, Art of Living founder, Ravi Shankar joined by other NGOs, prominent citizens, civic authorities along with many farmers and volunteers led a walkathon in Bangalore City. Apart from reviving some water bodies used by birds and animals, the project revived five water-recharge wells, constructed 74 boulder checks, cleaned up 18 step wells and planted 2,350 saplings in seven villages by June 2014.\n\nThe Art of Living, along with UN agencies, NGOs and civil society, launched Volunteer For a Better India (VFABI) on 5 December 2012. VFABI is involved in many activities, including protest against the 2012 Delhi gang rape case.\n\nIn May 2013, through one hundred eight free health camps organized in collaboration with the Indian Medical Association, 1,634 volunteers distributed medicines worth Rs. 2.2 million under the guidance of 262 doctors to over 20,000 slum dwellers in Delhi.\n\nIn September 2013, the 'I vote for better India' initiative was launched to bring about awareness about the importance of voting as a responsibility towards the nation. In the city of Pune around 500 volunteers have covered more than 400 housing societies, 60 firms and 30 colleges enrolling over 35,000 people in the voters' list. Students of the YCCE College in Nagpur initiated this campaign in their college and registered themselves along with their family and friends for voter identity cards.\n\nSri Sri University in Odisha was established in 2009 on the initiative of Ravi Shankar. The school won a Best Innovative University Award at the 2017 National Education Excellence Awards.\n\nArt of Living organizes courses based on breathing exercises and meditation. Sudarshan Kriya is the pivot of the majority of Art of Living courses, which are conducted by instructors, most of whom do voluntary work. These courses have also been conducted for students and faculty, government officials, firemen, ex-militants, and prisoners.\n\nThe Art of Living has entered the \"Guinness Book of Records\" for a Mohiniyattam dance organised in Cochin The performance has been awarded the world record for the most people performing a Mohiniyattam dance, the traditional Kerala dance form.\nThe organization organized a sitar concert \"Brahm Naad\" which also entered \"Guinness Book of Records\". The proceeds of the event went towards rehabilitation of the victims of the Bihar floods.\n\n\"Taal Ninaad\" held on 17 January 2012 at Solapur, which included 1230 tablas and 318 pakhavaj also entered the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nOn 16 May 2012, The Art of Living Foundation, organized a cultural evening in Hall 1 of the National Palace of Culture, NDK, in downtown Sofia, Bulgaria, where 333 Bulgarian bagpipers played a 9.13 minutes suite. The youngest player was 9 years old and the oldest player was 80 years old.\nMass recital of Jnanappana, a devotional poem written by the 16th century Malayalam poet Poonthanam, organized by the foundation on 2 February 2014, has also found place in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nIn 2010, Art of Living sued two anonymous bloggers, \"Skywalker\" and \"Klim\", accusing them of defamation, trade libel, copyright infringement and disclosing trade secrets. Claiming to be former teachers/followers in the organisation they created blogs critical of Art of Living. Art of Living's request to unmask Skywalker and Klim's identities was denied. Further, the judge allowed only the trade secrets claim to go to trial.\n\nIn 2012, Art of Living and the bloggers reached a settlement under which the foundation dropped the lawsuit without prejudice, compensated the bloggers' attorneys fees, and agreed to never again prosecute Skywalker, Klim, or any of their contributors. Skywalker and Klim agreed to freeze their existing blogs with no restriction on starting up new blogs critical of Art of Living.\n\nIn 2011 a public-interest litigation petition was filed in the high court alleging that Art of Living had constructed huge structures, encroaching upon the water spread area of Udipalya tank. The irrigation department of the state government of Karnataka inspected the area and found that the foundation had encroached upon of the tank area.\n\nA show cause notice was issued to the foundation by the state government.\n\nArt of Living Foundation organised World Culture Festival starting on 11 March 2016 held on the Yamuna Flood plains. A committee appointed by National Green Tribunal (NGT) recommended a fine of Rs 1,200 million on Art of Living Foundation for damaging ecology on Yamuna flood plains. The fine was reduced to Rs 50 million, no such events will be allowed at the location in future. The Foundation had initially refused to pay the fine. Sri Sri Ravishankar said he would rather go to prison than pay the fine. The foundation gave in to the NGT directions and paid the amount on 3 June 2016.\n"}

{"id": "2524068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2524068", "title": "Bernard Ramm", "text": "Bernard Ramm\n\nBernard L. Ramm (1 August 1916 in Butte, Montana - 11 August 1992 in Irvine, California) was a Baptist theologian and apologist within the broad Evangelical tradition. He wrote prolifically on topics concerned with biblical hermeneutics, religion and science, Christology, and apologetics. The hermenuetical principles presented in his 1956 book \"Protestant Biblical Interpretation\" influenced a wide spectrum of Baptist theologians. During the 1970s he was widely regarded as a leading evangelical theologian as well known as Carl F.H. Henry. His equally celebrated and criticized 1954 book \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\" was the theme of a 1979 issue of the \"Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation\", while a 1990 issue of Baylor University's \"Perspectives in Religious Studies\" was devoted to Ramm's views on theology.\n\nRamm initially studied chemistry then switched to philosophy of science in preparation for ministry. His tertiary education included a B.A. (University of Washington), B.D. (Eastern Baptist Seminary), M.A. in 1947 & Ph.D in 1950 (University of Southern California). He undertook additional studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Basel, Switzerland (1957-1958 academic year with Karl Barth), and the Near Eastern School of Theology, Beirut, Lebanon.\n\nHis academic teaching career began in 1943, when he joined the faculty at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now Biola University, La Mirada, California). He became Professor of Philosophy at Bethel College and Seminary, and then Professor of Religion at Baylor University, Texas. Most of his academic teaching took place at the American Baptist Seminary of the West at Covina, California, where he taught 1958–74 and again 1978-86. At that seminary he held the post of Professor of Systematic Theology.\n\nRamm wrote eighteen books, contributed chapters to other books, and authored over one hundred articles and book reviews that were published in various theological periodicals.\n\nIn his contributions to Christian apologetics, Ramm began his career in the evidentialist camp, but his later work reflected a shift in viewpoint to a modified form of presuppositional apologetics that had some affinity with the work of Edward John Carnell. In spite of harsh criticisms of Karl Barth from more traditionally Calvinist apologists such as Cornelius Van Til, Gordon Clark, and Carl F. H. Henry, Ramm would explore much of Barth's theological viewpoint, eventually embracing Barth's theology almost wholeheartedly as outlined in Ramm's own book \"After Fundamentalism\" (Harper & Row, 1983).\n\nRamm did not utilise the classical or Thomist approach in arguments for God's existence. He maintained that apart from faith God was unknowable. He likewise emphasised that the noetic effects of sin rendered theistic proofs useless. In Ramm's view, the proof of God's existence is in Holy Scripture.\n\nHe argued that the primary use of apologetic evidences is to create a favourable climate of opinion so that the Gospel may be proclaimed, and believed. In this respect he felt that miracles and fulfilled prophecy provided a factual basis for that climate of opinion. Ramm placed strong emphasis on the inner witness of the Holy Spirit verifying the gospel to the believer.\n\nIn some respects Ramm's emphasis on the inner witness of the Spirit reflected the view of John Calvin, but it also reflected the influence of Karl Barth, under whom he studied in Switzerland.\n\nNear the end of his life, Ramm was honored with a book of essays by his colleagues and younger contemporaries.\n\nIn his book, \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\", published in 1954, he was critical of \"flood geology\" and the notion of a young earth and influenced the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) in not supporting \"flood geology\" during the 1950s before Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb popularised Young Earth Creationism and Flood geology in their 1961 book entitled \"The Genesis Flood\".\n\nReformed theologian Meredith G. Kline known for advancing the framework interpretation of Genesis cites this book in his influential article \"Because It Had Not Rained\" after having reviewed it three years earlier, stating \"It is, indeed, informative and provocative. Moreover, it has some good emphases. It can, therefore, be read profitably if read critically.\" yet cautioning \"It would be well...for teachers of God's people to be hesitant or, at the least, very careful in providing public documentation of the history of their personal struggle after the truth.\" Kline also found Ramm's defense of the authority of scripture potentially inconsistent and Ramm's hermeneutical question regarding the place of natural revelation in interpreting scripture while a valid one, his approach in exploring and attempting to answer it done with too much zeal and dangerously close to being error-prone.\n\nThe publisher's choice of title in particular its initial article \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\" turned out to be a magnet for criticism. Ramm's original title was 'The Evangelical Faith and Modern Science', but the publisher changed this in order for it to be similar to the title of James Orr's 1893 book \"The Christian View of God and the World\".\n\nThe year 1979 marked the book's 25th anniversary, which was celebrated by the American Scientific Affiliation in devoting that year's December issue of its journal \"JASA\" to Ramm by including evaluations from theologians on the influence of \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\" as well as an interview with Ramm and his wife Alta.\n\nIn a survey of Religion and Science books, Covenant Theological Seminary professor and ordained PCA minister C. John Collins called this book \"a classic from a conservative evangelical author.\"\n\nHis work \"Protestant Christian Evidences\" is considered a classic and is still often cited.\n\nProfessor Ramm is often quoted for writing the following in his work \"Protestant Christian Evidences\":\n\nRamm also stated, in his often cited work \"Protestant Christian Evidences\", the following: \nA historic person named Jesus gave certain men such an impact as to be unequaled by far in the entire annals of the human race. After nearly two thousand years the impact is not at all spent, but daily there are people who have tremendous revolutionary experiences which they associate with Jesus Christ, be He dead or risen in Heaven. The personality of Jesus is without parallel. It is unique and incomparable (Protestant Christian Evidences [Chicago: Moody, 1953], p. 171).\n\n\n\n\n"}

By the 1980s he believed he had discovered a secret underground base near Dulce populated by grey aliens and humans. The story spread rapidly within the UFO community and by 1987, UFOlogist John Lear claimed he had independent confirmations of the base's existence. In 1988, the tabloid \"Weekly World News\" published a story entitled \"UFO Base Found in New Mexico\" which claimed that \"diabolical invaders from another solar system have set up a secret underground base in the rugged mountains of northern New Mexico – so they can shanghai human guinea pigs for bizarre genetic experiments\". The \"Weekly World News\" story used supposed quotes from UFOlogist Leonard Stringfield as a source for its claims. Upon learning of the story, Stringfield protested, \"I never read such a distortion of facts in my life\". \n\nPolitical scientist Michael Barkun writes that Cold War underground missile installations in the area gave superficial plausibility to the rumors, making the Dulce base story an \"attractive legend\" within UFOlogy. According to Barkun, claims about experiments on abductees and firefights between aliens and the Delta Force place the Dulce legend \"well outside even the most far-fetched reports of secret underground bases.\"\n\nResidents of Dulce claim to have seen UFOs, moving lights, and other unexplained sights in the area, which has little economic activity. Jicarilla Apache Legislative Council president Ty Vicenti \"has embraced the notion of a Dulce Base, partly in a push to stimulate tourism\", and in 2016, the town hosted the Dulce Base UFO Conference at the local casino hotel.\n\n\n"}

We write the evidence as a vector (\"p\", \"n\"). Let \"c\" be a positive constant representing a \"unit\" of evidence. An opinion (\"b\", \"d\", \"u\") is formed on the basis of the evidence (\"p\", \"n\"), in which \"b\",\"d\", and \"u\" respectively quantify the level of belief, disbelief and uncertainty in P. There is a one-to-one mapping between the opinion and the evidence,\n\nIn the original literature on subjective logic the constant was set to\n\"c\" = 2.\nThe mapping (1) is the unique solution of the following set of constraints,\nAlternatively, (1) can be derived from an analysis of \na posteriori probability \ndistributions\n(beta distributions).\n<br>\nThere are three \"corner points\" in opinion space:\nthe full Belief B = (1,0,0),\nthe full Disbelief D = (0,1,0),\nand full Uncertainty U = (0,0,1).\nOpinions on the line between B and D (including B and D) are called \"dogmatic opinions\". They have zero uncertainty, which is achievable only with an infinite amount of evidence. Dogmatic opinions are often excluded from the algebra.\n\nThe consensus operation combines two opinions about the same predicate into one opinion by piling up the evidence.\nLet \"x\" = (\"x\",\"x\",\"x\") \nand \"y\" = (\"y\",\"y\",\"y\") \nbe the opinions that are to be fused, and \n\"z\" = \"x\" ⊕ \"y\" the result.\nWe denote their evidence vectors as\n(\"p\", \"n\"),\nand\nrespectively.\nIn evidence space the consensus is straightforwardly defined as\n\nIn opinion space this yields\n\nwhich using (1) can be rewritten as\n\nThe consensus rule can only be applied if the evidence underlying\n\"x\" and \"y\" is independent, otherwise \"double counting\" of evidence occurs.\n\nThe traditional discounting operation in Subjective Logic is denoted as \n⊗ and defined as\n\nThis operation suffers from a number of serious problems, e.g.\n\nThese problems make it very difficult to handle trust networks in subjective logic.\n\nLet \"x\" = (\"x\", \"x\", \"x\") be an opinion based on evidence (\"p\", \"n\").

She is the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). In 2018, she was awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry for pioneering the use of directed evolution to engineer enzymes.\n\nArnold is the daughter of Josephine Inman (née Routheau) and nuclear physicist William Howard Arnold, and the granddaughter of Lieutenant General William Howard Arnold. She grew up in Pittsburgh suburb Edgewood, and Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, graduating from the city's Taylor Allderdice High School in 1974. As a high schooler, she hitchhiked to Washington, D.C. to protest the Vietnam War and lived on her own working as a cocktail waitress at a local jazz club and a cab driver.\n\nArnold graduated in 1979 with a B.S. degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton University, where she focused on solar energy research. In addition to the courses required for her major, she took classes in economics, Russian, and Italian, and envisioned herself as becoming a diplomat or CEO, even considering getting an advance degree in international affairs. She took a year off from Princeton after her second year to travel to Italy and work in a factory that made nuclear reactor parts, then returned to finish out her studies. Back at Princeton, she began studying with Princeton's Center for Energy and Environmental Studies – a group of scientists and engineers, at the time led by Robert Socolow, working to develop sustainable energy sources, a topic that would become a key focus of Arnold's later work.\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton in 1979, Arnold worked as an engineer in South Korea and Brazil and at Colorado's Solar Energy Research Institute. At the Solar Energy Research Institute (now the National Renewable Energy Laboratory), she worked on designing solar energy facilities for remote locations and helped write United Nations (UN) position papers.\n\nShe then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering in 1985 and became deeply interested in biochemistry in the process. Her thesis work, carried out in the lab of Harvey Warren Blanch, investigated affinity chromatography techniques.\n\nAfter earning her Ph.D., Arnold completed postdoctoral research in biophysical chemistry at Berkeley. In 1986, she joined the California Institute of Technology as a visiting associate. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1986, associate professor in 1992, and full professor in 1996. She was named the Dick and Barbara Dickinson Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry in 2000 and, her current position, the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry in 2017. In 2013, she was appointed director of Caltech's Donna and Benjamin M. Rosen Bioengineering Center.\n\nArnold is a member of the Advisory Board of the Joint BioEnergy Institute and the Packard Fellowships in Science and Engineering, and she serves on the President's Advisory Council of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). She is currently serving as a judge for The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. She worked with the National Academy of Science's Science & Entertainment Exchange to help Hollywood screenwriters accurately portray science topics.\n\nShe is co-inventor on over 40 US patents. She co-founded Gevo, Inc., a company to make fuels and chemicals from renewable resources in 2005. In 2013, she and two of her former students, Peter Meinhold and Pedro Coelho, cofounded a company called Provivi to research alternatives to pesticides for crop protection. She has been on the corporate board of the genomics company Illumina Inc. since 2016.\n\nArnold is credited with pioneering the use of directed evolution to create enzymes (biochemical molecules—often proteins—that catalyze, or speed up, chemical reactions) with improved and/or novel functions. The directed evolution strategy involves iterative rounds of randomly mutating proteins' genes and screening for proteins with improved functions and it has been used to create useful biological systems, including enzymes, metabolic pathways, genetic regulatory circuits, and organisms. In nature, evolution by natural selection can lead to proteins (including enzymes) well-suited to carry out biological tasks, but natural selection can only act on existing sequence variations (mutations) and typically occurs over long time periods. Arnold speeds up the process by introducing mutations in the underlying sequences of proteins; she then tests these mutations' effects. If a mutation improves the proteins' function she can keep iterating the process to optimize it further. This strategy has broad implications because it can be used to design proteins for a wide variety of applications. For example, she has used directed evolution to design enzymes that can be used to produce renewable fuels and pharmaceutical compounds with less harm to the environment.\n\nOne advantage of directed evolution is that the mutations do not have to be completely random; instead they can be random enough to discover unexplored potential, but not so random as to be inefficient. The number of possible mutation combinations is astronomical, but instead of just randomly trying to test as many as possible, Arnold integrates her knowledge of biochemistry to narrow down the options, focusing on introducing mutations in areas of the protein that are likely to have the most positive effect on activity and avoiding areas in which mutations would likely be, at best, neutral and at worst, detrimental (such as disrupting proper protein folding).\n\nArnold applied directed evolution to the optimization of enzymes (although not the first person to do so, see e.g. Barry Hall). In her seminal work, published in 1993, she used the method to engineer a version of subtilisin E that was active in a highly unnatural environment, namely in the organic solvent DMF. She carried out the work using four sequential rounds of mutagenesis of the enzyme's gene, expressed by bacteria, through error-prone PCR. After each round she screened the enzymes for their ability to hydrolyze the milk protein casein in the presence of DMF by growing the bacteria on agar plates containing casein and DMF. The bacteria secreted the enzyme and, if it were functional, it would hydrolyze the casein and produce a visible halo. She selected the bacteria that had the biggest halos and isolated their DNA for further rounds of mutagenesis. Using this method, she designed an enzyme that had 256 times more activity in DMF than the original.\n\nFollowing her seminal work, Arnold has further developed her methods and applied them under different selection criteria in order to optimize enzymes for different functions. She showed that, whereas naturally evolved enzymes tend to function well at a narrow temperature range, enzymes could be produced using directed evolution that could function at both high and low temperatures. In addition to improving the existing functions of natural enzymes, Arnold has designed enzymes that perform functions for which no previous specific enzyme existed, such as when she evolved cytochrome P450 to carry out cyclopropanation and carbene and nitrene transfer reactions.\n\nIn addition to evolving individual molecules, Arnold has used directed evolution to co-evolve enzymes in biosynthetic pathways, such as those involved in the production of carotenoids and L-methionine in \"Escherichia coli\" (which has the potential to be used as a whole-cell biocatalyst).\n\nArnold has applied these methods to biofuel production. For example, she evolved bacteria to produce the biofuel isobutanol; it can be produced in \"E. coli\" bacteria, but the production pathway requires the cofactor NADPH, whereas E. coli makes the cofactor NADH. To circumvent this problem, Arnold evolved the enzymes in the pathway to use NADH instead of NADPH, allowing for the production of isobutanol.\n\nArnold has also used directed evolution to design highly specific and efficient enzymes that can be used as environmentally-friendly alternatives to some industrial chemical synthesis procedures. She, and others using her methods, have engineered enzymes that can carry out synthesis reactions more quickly, with fewer by-products, and in some cases eliminating the need for hazardous heavy metals. The method has been adopted by some groups in pharmacology. For example, one of Arnold's former students, Jeffrey Moore, and colleagues used directed evolution to evolve an enzyme to produce the diabetes drug sitagliptin (Januvia).\n\nArnold also uses structure-guided protein recombination to combine parts of different proteins to form protein chimeras with unique functions. She developed computational methods, such as SCHEMA, to predict how the parts can be combined without disrupting their parental structure, so that the chimeras will fold properly, and then applies directed evolution to further mutate the chimeras to optimize their functions.\n\nAt Caltech, Arnold runs a laboratory that continues to study directed evolution and its applications in environmentally-friendly chemical synthesis and green/alternative energy, including the development of highly active enzymes (cellulolytic and biosynthetic enzymes) and microorganisms to convert renewable biomass to fuels and chemicals.\n\nArnold lives in La Cañada Flintridge, California. She was married to James E. Bailey and they had one son, James. Bailey died of cancer in 2001. Arnold was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and underwent treatment for 18 months.\n\nArnold later married Caltech astrophysicist Andrew E. Lange and they had two sons, William and Joseph. Lange took his own life in 2010 and one of their sons, William Lange-Arnold, died in an accident in 2016. \n\nHer hobbies include traveling, scuba diving, skiing, dirt-bike riding and hiking.\n\nArnold's work has been recognized by many awards, including the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the 2011 National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Draper Prize (the first woman to receive it), and a 2011 National Medal of Technology and Innovation. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011 and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014. She was the first woman to be elected to all three National Academies in the United States – the National Academy of Engineering (2000), the National Academy of Medicine, formerly called the Institute of Medicine (2004), and the National Academy of Sciences (2008).\n\nArnold is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Microbiology, the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and an International Fellow of the UK's Royal Academy of Engineering in 2018.\n\nIn 2016 she became the first woman to win the Millennium Technology Prize, which she won for pioneering directed evolution. In 2017, Arnold was awarded the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Prize in Convergence Research by the National Academy of Sciences, which recognizes extraordinary contributions to convergence research.\n\nIn 2018 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work in directed evolution, making her the fifth woman to receive the award in its 117 years of existence, and the first American woman. She received a one-half share of the award, with the other half jointly awarded to George Smith and Gregory Winter \"for the phage display of peptides and antibodies.\" She is the first female graduate of Princeton to be awarded a Nobel Prize and the first person who got their undergraduate degree from Princeton (male or female) to receive a Nobel Prize in one of the natural sciences categories (chemistry, physics, and physiology of medicine).\n\n\n\n"}

The Technology for peace, , initiative in 1997, founded by Yiannis Laouris and Harry Anastasiou members of the Cyprus Conflict Resolution Trainers Group aimed to capitalize on the proliferation of the Internet as a means to break the communication barriers between the northern and the southern parts of divided Cyprus. Other notable peace projects include the Youth promoting Peace, Civil Society Dialogue, the Act Beyond Borders, Everybody's song, and many projects funded by HasNa Inc..\n\nFuture Worlds Center is leading a number of pan-European efforts, which aim to promote the Millennium Development Goals within Europe and in Sub-Saharan countries. It was a founding member of the Cyprus Islandwide Development NGO Platform and the Cyprus Community Media Centre. The Accessing Development Education project has collected teaching materials or guidance books on topics like Development Education, Global citizenship, Human Rights, Millennium Development Goals and many others from across Europe into one central depository. The Teach MDGs project focuses on increasing awareness and public support for the Millennium Development Goals by actively engaging teacher training institutes, teachers and pupils in developing local oriented teaching resources promoting the MDGs with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and integrate these into the educational systems of countries across Europe.\n\nFuture Worlds Center is the implementing organization of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Representation in Cyprus. Its Humanitarian Affairs Unit implements projects that aim strengthening asylum for refugees and asylum seekers on the island. This Unit has founded the Unit of Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture. As of January 2018, a spin-off was created and the Cyprus Refugee Council was created.\n\n\n"}

Following the work of Eichhorn, de Wette, Graf, Kuenen, Nöldeke, Colenso and others, in his \"Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels\" Wellhausen proposed that Joshua represented part of the northern Yahwist source (\"c\" 950 BC), detached from JE document by the Deuteronomist (\"c\" 650–621) and incorporated into the Deuteronomic history, with the books of Judges, Kings, and Samuel.\n\nReasons for this unity, in addition to the presumed presence of the other documentary traditions, are taken from comparisons of the thematic concerns that underlie the narrative surface of the texts. For instance, the \"Book of Joshua\" stresses the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua. Furthermore the theme of \"Joshua\", the fulfillment of God's promise to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land, complements the thematic material of the Pentateuch, which had ended with the Israelites on the border of the Promised Land ready to enter.\n\nThe thesis that \"Joshua\" completes the \"Torah\" in a \"Hexateuch\" may be contrasted with the view of scholars following the older rabbinic tradition, as expressed by the compilers of the Jewish Encyclopedia (compiled between 1901 and 1906), that the \"Pentateuch\" is a complete work in itself. The thesis may also be contrasted with the view put forward by Eduard Meyer (1855–1930) that there never was any \"Hexateuch\" per se, but that the \"Law\", \"Joshua\", \"Judges\", \"Samuel\", and \"Kings\" once formed one great historic work.\n\n\n"}

Jayne\n\nHorace Howard Furness Jayne (Cape May, New Jersey, 9 June 1898 – 6 August 1975, Palm Beach, Florida) was an American museum director and curator, art historian, and expert on Asian art.\n\nHe was the son of University of Pennsylvania professor Horace Jayne and author Caroline Furness Jayne, and the grandson and namesake of Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness. He grew up in Philadelphia and Wallingford, Pennsylvania, and attended Episcopal Academy. Both parents died when he was in his teens; afterward he and his sister Kate lived with their uncle Dr. William Henry Furness III. He graduated from Harvard University in 1919, and was a member of its 1923-24 and 1925-26 archaeological expeditions to northwest China, sponsored by the Fogg Art Museum. He received a master's degree in art history from the University of Pennsylvania in 1933.\n\nHe joined the staff of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) in 1921, and was made curator of East Asian art in 1923. He served as director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 1929-1940; and as vice-director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1941-1949.\n\nDuring World War II, he was a member of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas, which provided the U.S. military with lists of and reports on cultural treasures in Europe and the Pacific Arena. The committee's recommendations led to creation of the Monuments Men program. The U.S. State Department took over the program in 1946, and Jayne was the first American civilian sent to China after the war. He headed the China desk of Voice of America, 1949-1953.\n\nHe returned to PMA in 1953 as acting chief of Eastern Art, and was named vice-director of the museum the following year. He retired from PMA in 1960, and moved to Seminole, Florida. He was advisory curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Florida, 1961-1966; and curator of Asian arts at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida from 1966 to his death in 1975.\n\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art's massive new building opened in March 1928, but with only about a sixth of its planned galleries completed and open to the public. That summer, director Fiske Kimball sent Jayne on a major buying trip to acquire architectural settings in which to exhibit PMA's East Asian art. In Nara Prefecture, Japan, Jayne purchased a circa-1400 temple, and in Tokyo, a traditional teahouse by architect Ōgi Rodō (1863–1941). In China, he purchased a circa-1775 scholar's study and a circa-1640 reception hall, both in Beijing.\nAt age 31, Jayne became director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, with its collection that focused on archaeology and anthropology. He and Kimball entered into a gentleman's agreement that they would not compete for artworks or artifacts. Each assessed his museum's collections, and exchanged objects that would build on the strengths of the other's holdings.\n\nThe late-Ming dynasty reception hall was from a minor palace outside the Forbidden City. The palace was built by Wang Cheng'en, a eunuch and loyal attendant to the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen Emperor (reign: 1628-1644). Li Zicheng and the Shun rebel army began their invasion of Beijing on April 24, 1644. The next day, the emperor and his imperial household committed suicide.\n\nThe building was constructed of wood, but its columns rested upon stone footings and its roof was of tile. The interior of the main room – 26 ft (7.92 m) tall, 45 ft (13.72 m) wide, and 35.5 ft (10.82 m) deep – featured beams and carved brackets decorated with intricately painted animals, birds, flowers and Chinese characters. Much of its nearly-300-year-old painted decoration survived.\n\nThe building was disassembled, and the numbered pieces arrived in Philadelphia by ship in Summer 1929. The Great Depression dealt a crippling blow to private fund-raising to finish the PMA interiors. Beginning in 1935, unemployed craftsmen were given work completing the galleries under the WPA. Reassembly of the reception hall began in 1937, and it was unveiled with the opening of the museum's Asian art wing in 1940.\n\nJayne edited the letters of his grandfather, Horace Howard Furness. He wrote numerous articles for the \"Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin\", the \"University Museum Bulletin\", the \"Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin\", and other publications. He was co-editor (with Langdon Warner of the Fogg Art Museum) of \"Eastern Art\", a quarterly journal that debuted in 1930 and folded in 1931 after 5 issues.\n\n\nJayne inherited \"Lindenshade,\" his grandfather's house and estate in Wallingford, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn June 5, 1928, he married Henrietta M. E. Bache (1908–1977), and they had five sons: twins Horace Jr. (1929–1987) and Franklin Bache (1929–2003), Charles (b. 1930), Timothy (b. 1932), and Fairman Rogers (b. 1936).\n\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1934.\n\nHe and his wife are buried at Woodlands Cemetery in West Philadelphia.\n\n"}

The impulse for the day came from the Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of Detained-Disappeared \"(Federación Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos,\" or FEDEFAM), a non-governmental organization founded in 1981 in Costa Rica as an association of local and regional groups actively working against secret imprisonment, forced disappearances and abduction in a number of Latin-American countries.\n\nWork on secret imprisonment is an important part of the activities for a number of international bodies and organizations in the fields of human rights activism and humanitarian aid, including for example Amnesty International (AI), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The International Day of the Disappeared is an opportunity to highlight these institutions' work, increase public awareness, and to call for donations and volunteers.\n\nOf those agencies, the ICRC has additional privileges due to its special status as a non-governmental sovereign entity and its strict policy of neutrality. In some cases, the ICRC is the only institution granted access to specific groups of prisoners, thereby enabling a minimum level of contact and inspection of their treatment. For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners.\n\nVisiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to restore and maintain contact with their families, is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate. But the definition of the Missing or the Disappeared goes far beyond the victims of enforced disappearance. It includes all those whose families have lost contact as the result of conflicts, natural disasters or other tragedies. \n\nThese missing may be detained, stranded in foreign countries, hospitalized or dead. Through its tracing services and working with the 189 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world, the ICRC seeks to obtain information about their fate on behalf of their families. It reminds governments and other groups of their obligations to respect the families' right to know the fate of their loved ones. It also works with families of the missing to help them address their particular psychological, social legal and financial needs.\n\nImprisonment under secret or uncertain circumstances is a grave violation of some conceptions of human rights as well as, in the case of an armed conflict, of International Humanitarian Law. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance as resolution 47/133 on December 18, 1992. It is estimated that secret imprisonment is practiced in about 30 countries. The OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has registered about 46,000 cases of people who disappeared under unknown circumstances.\n\nOn August 30, 2007, hundreds of Philippine relatives and supporters of desaparecidos, mostly activists, missing after being abducted or killed by Philippine security forces protested against the government to mark International Day of the Disappeared. Edita Burgos remembered her missing son, Jonas, a member of the Peasants' Movement of the Philippines.\n\nOn August 30, 2008 the International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances, which gathers family member organizations and human rights organizations from around the world, joined hands for a global campaign event to promote the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.\n\n"}
{"id": "241981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241981", "title": "Jean-François Lyotard", "text": "Jean-François Lyotard\n\nJean-François Lyotard (; ; 10 August 1924 – 21 April 1998) was a French philosopher, sociologist, and literary theorist. His interdisciplinary discourse spans such topics as epistemology and communication, the human body, modern art and postmodern art, literature and critical theory, music, film, time and memory, space, the city and landscape, the sublime, and the relation between aesthetics and politics. He is best known for his articulation of postmodernism after the late 1970s and the analysis of the impact of postmodernity on the human condition. He was a director of the International College of Philosophy which was founded by Jacques Derrida, François Châtelet, Jean-Pierre Faye and Dominique Lecourt.\n\nJean François Lyotard was born on August 10, 1924 in Vincennes, France to Jean-Pierre Lyotard, a sales representative, and Madeleine Cavalli. He went to primary school at the Paris Lycée Buffon and Louis-le-Grand. As a child, Lyotard had many aspirations: to be an artist, a historian, a Dominican monk, and a writer. He later gave up the dream of becoming a writer when he finished writing an unsuccessful fictional novel at the age of 15. Ultimately, Lyotard describes the realization that he would not become any of these occupations as \"fate\" in his intellectual biography called \"Peregrinations\", published in 1988.\n\nHe studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in the late 1940s. His 1947 DES thesis (\"\", roughly equivalent to an MA thesis), \"Indifference as an Ethical Concept\" (\"L'indifférence comme notion éthique\"), analyzed forms of indifference and detachment in Zen Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, and Epicureanism. In 1950, Lyotard took up a position teaching philosophy in Constantine in French Algeria but returned to mainland France in 1952 to teach at the Prytanée military academy in La Flèche, where he wrote a short work on Phenomenology, published in 1954. Lyotard moved to Paris in 1959 to teach at the Sorbonne: introductory lectures from this time (1964) have been posthumously published under the title \"Why Philosophize?\". Having moved to teach at the new campus of Nanterre in 1966, Lyotard participated in the events following March 22 and the tumult of May 1968. In 1971, Lyotard earned a State doctorate with his dissertation \"Discours, figure\" under Mikel Dufrenne—the work was published the same year. Lyotard joined the Philosophy department of the experimental University at Vincennes, later Paris 8, together with Gilles Deleuze, in the academic year 1970-71; it remained his academic home in France until 1987. He married his first wife, Andrée May, in 1948 with whom he had two children, Corinne and Laurence, and later married for a second time in 1993 to Dolores Djidzek, the mother of his son David (born in 1986).\n\nIn 1954, Lyotard became a member of \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\", a French political organisation formed in 1948 around the inadequacy of the Trotskyist analysis to explain the new forms of domination in the Soviet Union. \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\" had an objective to conduct a critique of Marxism from within during the Algerian war of liberation. His writings in this period mostly concern with ultra-left politics, with a focus on the Algerian situation—which he witnessed first-hand while teaching philosophy in Constantine. He wrote optimistic essays of hope and encouragement to the Algerians, which was reproduced in Political Writings. Lyotard hoped to encourage an Algerian fight for independence from France, and a social revolution. Following disputes with Cornelius Castoriadis in 1964, Lyotard left \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\" for the newly formed splinter group \"Pouvoir Ouvrier\", before resigning from \"Pouvoir Ouvrier\" in turn in 1966. Although Lyotard played an active part in the May 1968 uprisings, he distanced himself from revolutionary Marxism with his 1974 book \"Libidinal Economy\". He distanced himself from Marxism because he felt that Marxism had a rigid structuralist approach and they were imposing 'systematization of desires' through strong emphasis on industrial production as the ground culture.\n\nLyotard taught at the , Algeria from 1950 to 1952. In 1972, Lyotard began teaching at the University of Paris VIII; he taught there until 1987 when he became Professor Emeritus. During the next two decades he lectured outside France, notably as a Professor of Critical Theory at the University of California, Irvine and as visiting professor at universities around the world. These included: Johns Hopkins University, University of California, Berkeley, Yale University, Stony Brook University and the University of California, San Diego in the U.S., the Université de Montréal in Quebec (Canada), and the University of São Paulo in Brazil. He was also a founding director and council member of the Collège International de Philosophie, Paris. Before his death, he split his time between Paris and Atlanta, where he taught at Emory University as the Woodruff Professor of Philosophy and French.\n\nLyotard's work is characterised by a persistent opposition to universals, meta-narratives, and generality. He is fiercely critical of many of the 'universalist' claims of the Enlightenment, and several of his works serve to undermine the fundamental principles that generate these broad claims.\n\nIn his writings of the early 1970s, he rejects what he regards as theological underpinnings of both Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud: \"In Freud, it is judaical, critical sombre (forgetful of the political); in Marx it is catholic. Hegelian, reconciliatory (...) in the one and in the other the relationship of the economic with meaning is blocked in the category of representation (...) Here a politics, there a therapeutics, in both cases a laical theology, on top of the arbitrariness and the roaming of forces\". Consequently, he rejected Theodor W. Adorno's negative dialectics because he viewed them as seeking a \"therapeutic resolution in the framework of a religion, here the religion of history.\" In Lyotard's \"libidinal economics\" he aimed at \"discovering and describing different social modes of investment of libidinal intensities\".\n\nLyotard is a skeptic for modern cultural thought. According to his \"La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge)\" (1979), the impact of the postmodern condition was to provoke skepticism about universalizing theories. Lyotard argues that we have outgrown our needs for \"grand narratives\" due to the advancement of techniques and technologies since World War II. He argues against the possibility of justifying the narratives that bring together disciplines and social practices, such as science and culture; \"the narratives we tell to justify a single set of laws and stakes are inherently unjust.\" A loss of faith in meta-narratives has an effect on how we view science, art, and literature. Little narratives have now become the appropriate way for explaining social transformations and political problems. Lyotard argues that this is the driving force behind postmodern science. As metanarratives fade, science suffers a loss of faith in its search for truth, and therefore must find other ways of legitimating its efforts. Connected to this scientific legitimacy is the growing dominance for information machines. Lyotard argues that one day, in order for knowledge to be considered useful, it will have to be converted into computerized data. Years later, this led him into writing his book \"The Inhuman\", published in 1988, in which he illustrates a world where technology has taken over.\n\nMost famously, in \"La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge)\" (1979), he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the \"postmodern\" as an 'incredulity towards meta-narratives'. These meta-narratives—sometimes 'grand narratives'—are grand, large-scale theories and philosophies of the world, such as the progress of history, the knowability of everything by science, and the possibility of absolute freedom. Lyotard argues that we have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain us all. He points out that no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real and everyone had their own perspective and story. We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives. For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of 'language-games' found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.\n\nIn Lyotard's works, the term 'language games', sometimes also called 'phrase regimens', denotes the multiplicity of communities of meaning, the innumerable and incommensurable separate systems in which meanings are produced and rules for their circulation are created. This involves, for example, an incredulity towards the metanarrative of human emancipation. That is, the story of how the human race has set itself free that brings together the language game of science, the language game of human historical conflicts and the language game of human qualities into the overall justification of the steady development of the human race in terms of wealth and moral well-being. According to this metanarrative, the justification of science is related to wealth and education. The development of history is seen as a steady progress towards civilization or moral well-being. The language game of human passions, qualities and faults (c.f. character flaws (narratives)), is seen as steadily shifting in favor of our qualities and away from our faults as science and historical developments help us to conquer our faults in favor of our qualities. The point is that any event ought to be able to be understood in terms of the justifications of this metanarrative; anything that happens can be understood and judged according to the discourse of human emancipation. For example, for any new social, political or scientific revolution we could ask the question, \"Is this revolution a step towards the greater well-being of the mass of human beings?\" It should always be possible to answer this question in terms of the rules of justification of the metanarrative of human emancipation.\n\nThis becomes more crucial in \"Au juste: Conversations (Just Gaming)\" (1979) and \"Le Différend (The Differend)\" (1983), which develop a postmodern theory of justice. It might appear that the atomisation of human beings implied by the notion of the micronarrative and the language game suggests a collapse of ethics. It has often been thought that universality is a condition for something to be a properly ethical statement: 'thou shalt not steal' is an ethical statement in a way that 'thou shalt not steal from Margaret' is not. The latter is too particular to be an ethical statement (what's so special about Margaret?); it is only ethical if it rests on a universal statement ('thou shalt not steal from anyone'). But universals are impermissible in a world that has lost faith in metanarratives, and so it would seem that ethics is impossible. Justice and injustice can only be terms within language games, and the universality of ethics is out of the window. Lyotard argues that notions of justice and injustice do in fact remain in postmodernism. The new definition of injustice is indeed to use the language rules from one 'phrase regimen' and apply them to another. Ethical behaviour is about remaining alert precisely to the threat of this injustice, about paying attention to things in their particularity and not enclosing them within abstract conceptuality. One must bear witness to the 'differend.' In a differend, there is a conflict between two parties that cannot be solved in a just manner. However, the act of being able to bridge the two and understand the claims of both parties, is the first step towards finding a solution.\n\n\"I would like to call a differend the case where the plaintiff is divested of the means to argue and becomes for that reason a victim. If the addressor, the addressee, and the sense of the testimony are neutralized, everything takes place as if there were no damages. A case of differend between two parties takes place when the regulation of the conflict that opposes them is done in the idiom of one of the parties while the wrong suffered by the other is not signified in that idiom.\"\nIn more than one book, Lyotard promoted what he called paganism and contrasted it with both the rejection of the pagan gods in Book II of Plato's The Republic and the monotheism of Judaism. Lyotard argued that the pagan gods, unlike Platonic philosophy and monotheism, never claimed to have universal truth, but instead were better than humans because they were better at deceit and metamorphosis. Lyotard's paganism was also feminist because he argued that women, like paganism, are antirational and antiphilosophical.\n\nIn \"The Differend\", based on Immanuel Kant's views on the separation of Understanding, Judgment, and Reason, Lyotard identifies the moment in which language fails as the differend, and explains it as follows: \"...the unstable state and instant of language wherein something which must be able to be put into phrases cannot yet be… the human beings who thought they could use language as an instrument of communication, learn through the feeling of pain which accompanies silence (and of pleasure which accompanies the invention of a new idiom)\". Lyotard undermines the common view that the meanings of phrases can be determined by what they refer to (the referent). The meaning of a phrase—an event (something happens)--cannot be fixed by appealing to reality (what actually happened). Lyotard develops this view of language by defining \"reality\" in an original way, as a complex of possible senses attached to a referent through a name. The correct sense of a phrase cannot be determined by a reference to reality, since the referent itself does not fix sense, and reality itself is defined as the complex of competing senses attached to a referent. Therefore, the phrase event remains indeterminate.\n\nLyotard uses the example of Auschwitz and the revisionist historian Faurisson’s demands for proof of the Holocaust to show how the differend operates as a double bind (a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions). Faurisson will only accept proof of the existence of gas chambers from eyewitnesses who were themselves victims of the gas chambers. However, any such eyewitnesses are dead and are not able to testify. Either there were no gas chambers, in which case there would be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, or there were gas chambers, in which case there would still be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, because they would be dead. Since Faurisson will accept no evidence for the existence of gas chambers, except the testimony of actual victims, he will conclude from both possibilities (gas chambers existed and gas chambers did not exist) that gas chambers did not exist. This presents a double bind. There are two alternatives, either there were gas chambers or there were not, which lead to the same conclusion: there were no gas chambers (and no final solution). The case is a differend because the harm done to the victims cannot be presented in the standard of judgement upheld by Faurisson.\n\nLyotard was a frequent writer on aesthetic matters. He was, despite his reputation as a postmodernist, a great promoter of modernist art. Lyotard saw postmodernism as a latent tendency within thought throughout time and not a narrowly limited historical period. He favoured the startling and perplexing works of the high modernist avant-garde. In them he found a demonstration of the limits of our conceptuality, a valuable lesson for anyone too imbued with Enlightenment confidence. Lyotard has written extensively also on many contemporary artists of his choice: Valerio Adami, Daniel Buren, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Monory, Ruth Francken, Shusaku Arakawa, Bracha Ettinger, Sam Francis, Karel Appel, Barnett Newman, René Guiffrey, Gianfranco Baruchello and Albert Ayme as well as on earlier artists, notably Paul Cézanne and Paul Klee.\n\nHe developed these themes in particular by discussing the sublime. The \"sublime\" is a term in aesthetics whose fortunes revived under postmodernism after a century or more of neglect. It refers to the experience of pleasurable anxiety that we experience when confronting wild and threatening sights like, for example, a massive craggy mountain, black against the sky, looming terrifyingly in our vision. A sublime is the conjunction of two opposed feelings, which makes it harder for us to see the injustice of it, or a solution to it.\n\nLyotard found particularly interesting the explanation of the sublime offered by Immanuel Kant in his \"Critique of Judgment\" (sometimes \"Critique of the Power of Judgment\"). In this book, Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms: there are two kinds of 'sublime' experience. In the 'mathematically' sublime, an object strikes the mind in such a way that we find ourselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely, we experience a clash between our reason (which tells us that all objects are finite) and the imagination (the aspect of the mind that organizes what we see, and which sees an object incalculably larger than ourselves, and feels infinite). In the 'dynamically' sublime, the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than we, whose weight, force, scale could crush us without the remotest hope of our being able to resist it. (Kant stresses that if we are in \"actual\" danger, our feeling of anxiety is very different from that of a sublime feeling. The sublime is an aesthetic experience, not a practical feeling of personal danger.) This explains the feeling of anxiety.\n\nWhat is deeply unsettling about the mathematically sublime is that the mental faculties that present visual perceptions to the mind are inadequate to the concept corresponding to it; in other words, what we are able to make ourselves see cannot fully match up to what we know is there. We know it's a mountain but we cannot take the whole thing into our perception. Our sensibility is incapable of coping with such sights, but our reason can assert the finitude of the presentation. With the dynamically sublime, our sense of physical danger should prompt an awareness that we are not just physical material beings, but moral and (in Kant's terms) noumenal beings as well. The body may be dwarfed by its power but our reason need not be. This explains, in both cases, why the sublime is an experience of pleasure as well as pain.\n\nLyotard is fascinated by this admission, from one of the philosophical architects of the Enlightenment, that the mind cannot always organise the world rationally. Some objects are simply incapable of being brought neatly under concepts. For Lyotard, in \"Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime\", but drawing on his argument in \"The Differend\", this is a good thing. Such generalities as 'concepts' fail to pay proper attention to the particularity of things. What happens in the sublime is a crisis where we realise the inadequacy of the imagination and reason to each other. What we are witnessing, says Lyotard, is actually the differend; the straining of the mind at the edges of itself and at the edges of its conceptuality.\n\nIn one of Lyotard's most famous books, \"Libidinal Economy\" he offers a critique of Marx’s \"false consciousness\" and claims that the 19th century working class enjoyed being a part of the industrialization process. Lyotard claims that this is due to libidinal energy. The term \"libidinal\" coming from the term \"libido\" which is used to refer to the psychoanalytical desires of our deeper consciousness. Lyotard’s writings in \"Libidinal Economy\" is an achievement in our attempts to live with the rejection of all religious and moral principles through an undermining of the structures associated with it. Structures conceal libidinal intensities while intense feelings and desires force us away from set structures. However, there also can be no intensities or desires without structures, because there would be no dream of escaping the repressive structures if they do not exist. \"Libidinal energy comes from this disruptive intervention of external events within structures that seek order and self-containment.\" This was the first of Lyotard's writings that had really criticized a Marxist view. It achieved great success, but was also the last of Lyotard's writings on this particular topic where he really went against the views of Karl Marx.\n\nIn 1985, Lyotard co-curated the exhibition \"Les Immatériaux\" at the Centre de Création Industrielle of Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, together with the design theorist and curator Thierry Chaput.\n\nLyotard was impressed by the importance of childhood in human life, which he saw as providing the opportunity of creativity, as opposed to the settled hubris of maturity. In 'The Grip', however, he also explored the hold of childhood experience on the individual through the (Roman) concept of the Mancipium, or authoritative right of possession. Because parental influences affect the new-born before it has the linguistic skill even to articulate – let alone oppose – them, Lyotard considered that \"We are born from others but also to others, given over defenceless to them. Subject to their \"mancipium\".\"\n\nSome of the latest works that Lyotard had been working on were both writings about a French writer, activist, and politician, André Malraux. One of them being a biography, \"Signed, Malraux\". Lyotard was interested in the aesthetic views of society that Malraux shared. Lyotard's other book was named \"The Confession of Augustine\" and was a study in the phenomenology of time. This work-in-progress was published posthumously in the same year of Lyotard's death.\n\nLyotard repeatedly returned to the notion of the Postmodern in essays gathered in English as \"The Postmodern Explained to Children\", \"Toward the Postmodern\", and \"Postmodern Fables\". In 1998, while preparing for a conference on postmodernism and media theory, he died unexpectedly from a case of leukemia that had advanced rapidly. He is buried in Division 6 of Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\n\nThere are three major criticisms of Lyotard's work. Each coincides with a school of thought. Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy have written deconstructions of Lyotard's work (Derrida 1992; Nancy 1985). They focus on Lyotard's postmodern work and on \"The Differend\" in particular. A differend depends upon a distinction drawn between groups that itself depends upon the heterogeneity of language games and genres of discourse. Why should these differences be privileged over an endless division and reconstruction of groups? In concentrating on specific differences, Lyotard's thought becomes overly dependent on differences; between categories that are given as fixed and well defined. From the point of view of deconstruction, Lyotard's philosophy gives too much credit to illegitimate categories and groups. Underlying any different there is a multiplicity of further differences; some of these will involve crossing the first divide, others will question the integrity of the groups that were originally separated.\n\nManfred Frank (1988) has put the Frankfurt School criticism best. It attacks Lyotard's search for division over consensus on the grounds that it involves a philosophical mistake with serious political and social repercussions. Lyotard has failed to notice that an underlying condition for consensus is also a condition for the successful communication of his own thought. It is a performative contradiction to give an account that appeals to our reason on behalf of a difference that is supposed to elude it. So, in putting forward a false argument against a rational consensus, Lyotard plays into the hands of the irrational forces that often give rise to injustice and differ ends. Worse, he is then only in a position to testify to that injustice, rather than put forward a just and rational resolution.\n\nFrom a Nietzschean and Deleuzian point of view (James Williams 2000), Lyotard's postmodern philosophy took a turn toward a destructive modern nihilism that his early work avoids. The different and the sublime are negative terms that introduce a severe pessimism at the core of Lyotard's philosophy. Both terms draw lines that cannot be crossed and yet they mark the threshold of that which is most valuable for the philosophy, that which is to be testified to and its proper concern. It is not possible repetitively to lend an ear to the sublime without falling into despair due to its fleeting nature. Whenever we try to understand or even memorize: the activity of testimony through the sublime, it can only be as something that has now dissipated and that we cannot capture.\n\nCharles J. Stivale, of Wayne State University, wrote a critique of Lyotard's \"The Differend\" for \"The French Review\", in 1990. In it, he states: \"Jean-François Lyotard's is a dense work of philosophical, political and ethical reflection aimed at a specialized audience versed in current debates in logic, pragmatics and post-structuralism. Even George Van Den Abbeele's excellent translation, complete with a glossary of French terms not available in the original text (Paris: Minuit, 1983), does not, indeed cannot, alleviate the often terse prose with which Lyotard develops his reasoning. With this said, I must also observe that this work is of vital importance in a period when revisionism of all stripes attempts to rewrite, and often simply deny, the occurrence of historical and cultural events, i.e. in attempting to reconstruct 'reality\" in the convenient names of \"truth\" and \"common sense\" … This overview must leave unexplored the broad philosophical bases from which Lyotard draws support, as well as important questions that he raises regarding history, justice and critical judgement. I can conclude only by suggesting that this work, despite the formidable difficulties inherent to its carefully articulated arguments, offers readers a rich formulation of precise questions for and about the current period of critical transition and re-opening in philosophy, ethics and aesthetics.\"\n\nThe collective tribute to Lyotard following his death was organized by the Collège International de Philosophie, and chaired by Dolores Lyotard and Jean-Claude Milner, the College's director at that time. The proceedings were published by PUF in 2001 under the general title \"Jean-François Lyotard, l'exercice du différend\".\n\nLyotard's work continues to be important in politics, philosophy, sociology, literature, art, and cultural studies. To mark the tenth anniversary of Lyotard's death, An international symposium about Jean-François Lyotard organized by the Collège International de Philosophie (under the direction of Dolores Lyotard, Jean-Claude Milner and Gerald Sfez) was held in Paris from January 25–27 in 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

He also served as Senator of Colombia, and Ambassador to France and Austria and is an author of several books.\n\nHe was born in Paris, France on August 21, 1923 to Colombian parents, Francisco Laserna Bravo and Elena Pinzón Castillo, and was raised first in Colombia where he attended the Instituto La Salle and then from 1931 to 1932 in Queens in NYC. He graduated from the Gimnasio Moderno in 1940 and went on to study Law for three years at Our Lady of the Rosary University to later change his career and move to the United States to attend Columbia University where he completed his undergraduate studies in Mathematics, Physics, and Humanities in 1948. He would go on to obtain a Master's degree at Princeton University and to study German and philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, and he later obtained a Doctorate at the Free University of Berlin.

The practice has traditionally been associated with the Apostleship of Prayer. While since 1929 the Pope has added a general and a mission intention to the traditional morning offering prayer each month, Pope Francis has restored this to the original. single monthly intention. Over time other forms of the morning offering prayer have been suggested.\n\nThe morning offering has been an old practice in the Church but it started to spread largely through the Apostleship of Prayer, started by Fr. Francis X. Gautrelet, S.J., and especially through the book written by another Jesuit, Fr. Henri Ramière, S.J., who in 1861 adapted the Apostleship of Prayer for parishes and various Catholic institutions, and made it known by his book \"The Apostleship of Prayer\" which has been translated into many languages. \n\nHistoric roots of such a practice can be traced to those like Saint Mechtilde (1241-1298) who had visions of Jesus Christ and transmitted the following words of Jesus: \"When you awake in the morning, let your first act be to salute My Heart, and to offer Me your own. ...Whoever shall breathe a sigh toward Me from the bottom of his heart when he awakes in the morning and shall ask Me to work all his works in him throughout the day, will draw Me to him. ...For never does a man breathe a sigh of longing aspiration toward Me without drawing Me nearer to him than I was before.\"\n\nSaint John Mary Vianney has also said: \"All that we do without offering it to God is wasted.\" Catholic authors encourage repeating this offering throughout the day, especially at the start of one's professional work which takes a large part of each day.\n\nThe \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" states:\n\nThe other element in this theology is the actual work done with spirit of excellence in consonance with the intention of offering something \"worthy\" to the sanctity, majesty, and goodness of our God.\n\nThis theology is also supported by private revelation. Sister Josefa Menéndez (1890-1923) reported that she heard Jesus Christ tell her: \"When you awake, enter at once into My Heart, and when you are in it, offer My Father all your actions united to the pulsations of My Heart. ...If [a person is] engaged in work of no value in itself, if she bathes it in My Blood or unites it to the work I Myself did during My mortal life, it will greatly profit souls, ... more, perhaps, than if she had preached to the whole world.\"\n\nThe Morning offering is meant to be prayed first thing in the morning, upon waking up. In its simplest form, a morning offering is nothing more than a brief prayer that recognizes the presence of God, and puts the day ahead in God's hands. Many forms of this offering are proposed on the website of the Apostleship of Prayer.\n\nThe traditional \"Morning offering to the Sacred Heart of Jesus\" was composed by French Jesuit Fr. François-Xavier Gautrelet in 1844. It reflects the \"Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary\".\nTraditional Morning Offering\n\nChildren's daily offering prayer\n\nSt. Mechtilde revelation, with two other mystics\n\nA daily offering for pro-life activists\n\n"}

Neats consider that solutions should be elegant, clear and provably correct. Scruffies believe that intelligence is too complicated (or computationally intractable) to be solved with the sorts of homogeneous system such neat requirements usually mandate.\n\nMuch success in AI came from combining neat and scruffy approaches. For example, there are many cognitive models matching human psychological data built in Soar and ACT-R. Both of these systems have formal representations and execution systems, but the rules put \"into\" the systems to create the models are generated ad hoc.\n\nThe distinction was originally made by Roger Schank in the mid-1970s to characterize the difference between his work on natural language processing (which represented commonsense knowledge in the form of large amorphous semantic networks) from the work of John McCarthy, Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, Robert Kowalski and others whose work was based on logic and formal extensions of logic. Roger Schank actually notes that he originally made this distinction in linguistics, related to Chomskian vs. non-Chomskian, but discovered it works in AI too, and other areas.\n\nThe distinction was also partly geographical and cultural: \"scruffy\" was associated with AI research at MIT under Marvin Minsky in the 1960s. The laboratory was famously \"freewheeling\" and researchers often developed AI programs by spending long hours tweaking programs until they showed the required behavior. This practice was named \"hacking\" and the laboratory gave birth to the hacker culture. Important and influential \"scruffy\" programs developed at MIT included Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA, which behaved as if it spoke English, without any formal knowledge at all, and Terry Winograd's SHRDLU, which could successfully answer queries and carry out actions in a simplified world consisting of blocks and a robot arm. SHRDLU, while enormously successful, could not be scaled up into a useful natural language processing system, however, because it had no overarching design and maintaining a larger version of the program proved to be impossible; it was too scruffy to be extended.\n\nOther AI laboratories (of which the largest were Stanford, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Edinburgh) focused on logic and formal problem solving as a basis for AI. These institutions supported the work of John McCarthy, Herbert A. Simon, Allen Newell, Donald Michie, Robert Kowalski, and many other \"neats\".\n\nThe contrast between MIT's approach and other laboratories was also described as a \"procedural/declarative distinction\". Programs like SHRDLU were designed as agents that carried out actions; they executed \"procedures\". Other programs were designed as inference engines that manipulated formal statements (or \"declarations\") about the world and translated these manipulations into actions.\n\nThe debate reached its peak in the middle 1980s. Nils Nilsson in his presidential address to Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 1983, discussed the issue, arguing that \"the field needed both\". He wrote \"much of the knowledge we want our programs to have can and should be represented declaratively in some kind of declarative, logic like formalism. Ad hoc structures have their place, but most of these come from the domain itself.\" Alex P. Pentland and Martin Fischler of MIT argued in response that \"There is no question that deduction and logic-like formalisms will play an important role in AI research; however, it does not seem that they are up to the Royal role that Nils suggests. This pretender King, while not naked, appears to have a limited wardrobe.\" Many other researchers also weighed in on one side or the other of the issue.\n\nThe scruffy approach was applied to robotics by Rodney Brooks in the middle 1980s. He advocated building robots that were, as he put it, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control (the title of a 1989 paper co-authored with Anita Flynn). Unlike earlier robots such as Shakey or the Stanford cart, they did not build up representations of the world by analyzing visual information with algorithms drawn from mathematical machine learning techniques, and they did not plan their actions using formalizations based on logic, such as the 'Planner' language. They simply reacted to their sensors in a way that tended to help them survive and move.\n\nDoug Lenat's Cyc project, one of the oldest and most ambitious projects to capture all of human knowledge in machine readable form, is \"a determinedly scruffy enterprise\" (according to Pamela McCorduck). The Cyc database contains millions of facts about all the complexities of the world, each of which must be entered one at a time, by knowledge engineers. Each of these entries is an ad hoc addition to the intelligence of the system. While there may be a \"neat\" solution to the problem of commonsense knowledge (such as machine learning algorithms with natural language processing that could study the text available over the internet), no such project has yet been successful.\n\nNew statistical and mathematical approaches to AI were developed in the 1990s, using highly developed formalisms such as Bayesian nets and mathematical optimization. This general trend towards more formal methods in AI is described as \"the victory of the neats\" by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell. Pamela McCorduck, in 2004: \"As I write, AI enjoys a Neat hegemony, people who believe that machine intelligence, at least, is best expressed in logical, even mathematical terms.\" Neat solutions have been highly successful in the 21st century and are now used throughout the technology industry. These solutions, however, have mostly been applied to specific problems with specific solutions, and the problem of general intelligence remains unsolved.\n\nThe terms \"neat\" and \"scruffy\" are rarely used by AI researchers in the 21st century, although the issue remains unresolved. \"Neat\" solutions to problems such as machine learning and computer vision, have become indispensable throughout the technology industry, but ad-hoc and detailed solutions still dominate research into robotics and commonsense knowledge.\n\nAs might be guessed from the terms, \"neats\" use formal methods – such as logic or pure applied statistics – exclusively. \"Scruffies\" are hackers, who will cobble together a system built of anything – even logic. Neats care whether their reasoning is both provably sound and complete and that their machine learning systems can be shown to converge in a known length of time. Scruffies would like their learning to converge too, but they are happier if empirical experience shows their systems working than to have mere equations and proofs showing that they \"ought\" to.\n\nTo a neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only by accident and unlikely to produce insights about how intelligence actually works. To a scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and to be too slow, fragile or boring to be applied to real systems.\n\nThis conflict goes much deeper than computer programming practices, (though it clearly has parallels in software engineering). For philosophical or possibly scientific reasons, some people believe that intelligence is fundamentally rational, and can best be represented by logical systems incorporating truth maintenance. Others believe that intelligence is best implemented as a mass of learned or evolved hacks, not necessarily having internal consistency or any unifying organizational framework.\n\nThe apparently scruffy philosophy may also turn out to be provably (under typical assumptions) optimal for many applications. Intelligence is often seen as a form of search, and as such not believed to be perfectly solvable in a reasonable amount of time (see also NP and Simple Heuristics, commonsense reasoning, memetics, reactive planning).\n\nIt is an open question whether \"human\" intelligence is inherently scruffy or neat. Some claim that the question itself is unimportant: the famous neat John McCarthy has said publicly he has no interest in how human intelligence works, while famous scruffy Rodney Brooks is openly obsessed with creating humanoid intelligence. (See Subsumption architecture, Cog project (Brooks 2001)).\n\nNeats\n\n\nScruffies\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was an enlightenment era writer and a member of a circle of Illuminati. He was a diplomat and a free mason. He was also a friend of the composer Mozart.\n\nOtto Heinrich von Gemmingen-Hornberg was born at the Free imperial city Heilbronn where his parents were based for a period. His father, also called Otto Heinrich von Gemmingen (1727–90) worked as a judge at the imperial district court in Wetzlar, and it was here that he spent the first ten years of his life, receiving his schooling from his father, probably with backup from a tutor.\n\nHis mother, Marie Elis von Gemmingen-Hornberg (1723-1775), was the widow of Count von Virmont and a daughter of Johann Hermann Franz von Nesselrode.\n\nAfter the death of his grandfather his father gave up his work as a judge in 1766 and the family relocated to Heilbronn. From the lawyerly social milieu in the bustling commercial centre, he would move to a more traditionally aristocratic lifestyle during his earl teenage years, with parties and concerts and fireworks in summer evenings and tobogganing in the winter. It was in this context that the younger Otto Heinrich - generally known as Heinrich in the family - had his first experience of \"theatre\" at the \"Komödiensaal\" in the town hall, making frequent stage appearances in the works of Lessing, Schiller, Shakespeare and other playwrights fashionable at the time. His father nevertheless continued to place emphasis on more serious aspects of his education. Important for any future career in politics or diplomacy was mastery of the French language, and both French and Jurisprudence featured prominently in his studies. Literature and Music were not ignored, however. Heinrich had access not merely to his father's extensive library but also to the public library in the town, which afforded excellent opportunities for building his knowledge. He also became a competent performer on the 'cello and on the piano. He was a frequent visitor at the home of , the longstanding mayor of Heilbronn, by whose wife, Charlotte Sophie von Wacks, a great lover of the arts, Heinrich's own taste was greatly influenced. During these teenage years he also had a brief but intense love affair with Lotte, the daughter of a Heilbronn businessman. His artistic mentor, Charlotte Sophie von Wacks, attempted to end the affair which she believed might obstruct Heinrich's subsequent education. She warned Lotte's mother what was happening. When that failed to have any effect she arranged a meeting between the two fathers. In the end Lotte was persuaded that Heinrich's commitment was not as absolute as she had thought, while Heinrich's father brought forward the date on which the boy should be sent away to pursue his studies. Heinrich von Gemmingen later recycled the experience in his play, \"Der deutsche Hausvater\", with which he established his reputation as a dramatist virtually overnight.\n\nWhen he was still only 19 he was sent to Mannheim to pursue his legal studies, although he still made frequent returns to Heilbronn where he continued to participate in the drama productions at the town hall. As far as theatre was concerned, the atmosphere in Mannheim was at this stage strikingly less carefree than in provincial Heilbronn, and tainted by an undercurrent of piety: the absolutist rulers had let it be known that scholars and aristocrats should attend theatre, if at all, discreetly, observing performances only from the back of the auditorium. Von Gemmingen's love for the theatre persisted, however, and Mannheim was changing. Its position on one of Europe's main communication channels, the River Rhine, gave the city quick access to new currents of \"Enlightenment\" thinking. He settled quickly into Mannheim society and soon came to the attention of the authorities. After barely half a year in the city he was appointed a chamberlain, although he never showed any appetite for the life of a courtier. In any case, jobs of this nature disappeared when the royal court left Mannheim for Munich in 1778 after Charles Theodore, the Prince-Elector, inherited the dukedom of Bavaria. Meanwhile, von Gemmingen continued to read extensively and to profit from the cultural opportunities provided by Mannheim and nearby Schwetzingen. He attended and was deeply affected by a performance of what was said to be the first opera sung in the German language. Around this time he took the decision to devote his free time in future to learning how to become a writer. He wanted to be able to use these skills to enlighten and, in the words of one source, to liberate the simple people from ignorance.\n\nMeanwhile, in or before 1777 he became a \"Hofkammerrath\" in Mannheim, which cemented his membership of society and gave him oversight responsibilities for education and schools which also extended to the \"deutsche Bühne\" (principal Mannheim theatre), (a set of duties from which Gotthold Ephraim Lessing had just resigned).\n\nMozart arrived in Mannheim at the start of his second visit to the city on 30 October 1777. Gemmingen-Hornberg and the composer quickly got to know one another and to value each other's company. They shared a love of music and a passion for the theatre. Together they worked on \"Semiramis\", an opera which is believed subsequently to have been lost (and may very well never have been completed). Mozart mentions Gemmingen a number of times in letters to his father. He writes about their work together on the first act of \"Semiramis\" in which the work is described as an \"opera\" and then as a \"duodrama\". During the next few months Mozart and Gemmingen were frequently seen out and about together, for instance in rehearsals for the Holzbauer opera \"Günter von Schwarzburg\". They were seen together on 6 November 1777 when Mozart was presented to the prince-elector, and again on 3 December when Mozart was giving lessons to the (\"extra-marital\") four children of the prince-elector born in rapid succession to Josepha Seyffert (who later became the Countess von Heydeck). Although himself a member of the influential \"Kurpfälzischen Deutschen Gesellschaft\" (\"Kurpfalz German Society\") only since 1776, Gemmingen was well known to fellow members, having already given many presentations and lectures to it, and he was able to introduce Mozart to the membership. That led to a number of intense discussions over how the German language might be promoted, at a time when much literature was in French and operas normally featured Italian lyrics. There was also discussion over how a German national theatre might be established.\n\nOn 15 March 1778 Mozart set out on a journey to Paris, accompanied by his mother. He had already been obliged to sell his own carriage to finance the trip, and Gemmingen was able to improve the quality of his journey, providing three gold \"Louis d'or\" coins, \"to repay the expense of writing out the music\" of a recently composed quartet.\n\nMeanwhile, the national theatre project became a reality and on 1 September 1778 Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg was appointed intendant (in effect, director) of the National Theatre in Mannheim. A permanent theatre company was created, headed up by August Wilhelm Iffland. The first production was presented on 7 October 1779 and within a few years Mannheim became one of the leading theatres in Germany. The premier of The Robbers on 13 January 1782 was a huge success with the public, marking as it did the public launch of the career of a new playwright, Friedrich Schiller. The success also made the National Theatre itself a cultural focus for intellectual elites. In recognition of his contribution to launching and sustaining the theatre project Heinrich von Gemmingen zu Hornberg was invited to assume oversight of dramaturgy. He also became a frequent and committed theatre critic. In 1779 it became apparent that he had also been working on a play of his own.\n\nMeanwhile, early in July 1778, news came through that Mozart's mother had died suddenly while accompanying her son in Paris. Mozart returned to Mannheim where Gemmingen showed him the translation he was working on of Rousseau's Pygmalion, and discussed his plans for translating Shakespeare's Richard III. However, Mozart received a forceful letter from his father, dated 9 December 1778, ordering him urgently back to Vienna. There was no question of disobeying his father, but Mozart gave free rein to his anger.\n\nIn 1779 Gemmingen revisited the thwarted love affair of his youth with his performance piece \"Der deutsche Hausvater\" (\"loosely: \"The German house father\"\"). The play was presented in the Autumn/Fall before the \"Kurpfälzischen Deutschen Gesellschaft\" (\"Kurpfalz German Society\"). It was consciously and unusually political, denouncing the division between aristocracy and bourgeoisie, and the treatment of the peasantry by both. Gemmingen used the piece as a passionate attack on class barriers. The audience included both friends and critics - those who had criticised him in the past for excessive restraint and vagueness. At the end of the first reading, resounding applause broke out. Apprehension on the part of some of the aristocratic audience members could not prevent the piece becoming a success. The actor manager Friedrich Ludwig Schröder (who later became a personal friend), immediately accept the play for his company, and headed up the first performance at Hamburg on 4 October 1779. Within a few months \"Der deutsche Hausvater\" was enjoying long runs in Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, Vienna, Prague and a number of smaller cities. It was even translated into Italian. Friedrich Schiller, whose own later play Intrigue and Love was clearly influenced by \"Hausvater\", wrote effusively to Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg at the National Theatre, with warm words to be passed to the author of the work.\n\nIt is believed that Gemmingen joined the freemasons around 1779 when he was 24. He had connections with several lodges, not just in Mannheim itself but also in Heidelberg, Worms and Vienna. There are also indications that he introduced the young Mozart to freemasonry during the composer's time in Mannheim, although there is no firm evidence for this. It is probable that Gemmingen became a member of the in Mannheim in 1779, some 23 years after the establishment of the lodge, which came under the direction of the Grand Lodge . He appears already to have reached the degree of \"Master\" by 1782 when he relocated to Vienna where, between 1782 and 1787, he was regarded as one of the city's leading free masons.\n\nHis court appointment involved working in the Schwetzingen Palace, and Gemmingen therefore took rooms in the palace \"for reasons of economy\" (as he wrote to his father). This meant regularly dining at the Prince-elector's table, and in the palace grounds he frequently met the Countess Palatine accompanied by her ladies in waiting. One of these was the Countess Charlotte von Sicklingen (1756-1826). Gemmingen and Charlotte married on 8 September 1779. Shortly afterwards the couple were temporarily separated when the Prince-elector acquired Bavaria and moved the court to Munich. Gemmingen moved with the court. The Prince-elector's wife, the Countess Palatine remained in Mannheim, however, together with her ladies in waiting.\n\nIn Munich Gemmingen oversaw the first Munich productions of \"The Inheritance\" and \"The House-father\", which had to be adapted for Bavarian conditions. However, in 1780 he was able to return to Mannheim for the birth of .\n\nIn 1781 oversight of schools, which had fellan within the Gemmingen's remit, was transferred to the Catholic Church. That would have been a setback to any ambitions Gemmingen may have had to implement the new Enlightenment values in the electorate. A little earlier, in November 1780, the death of the Empress Maria Theresa had left her eldest son, as Emperor Joseph II, free to pursue Enlightenment ideals in the Hapsburg lands, unencumbered by his mother's pragmatic conservatism. Heinrich von Gemmingen's position at court was worth 950 Gulden per month plus bonuses. He now resigned his position and moved to Vienna where he hoped to be able to progress his goals under more favourable conditions. In Vienna he received a friendly welcome: it is possible that his friend Mozart had prepared the ground for his arrival. He quickly gained access to the household of the , who was exceptionally well connected in literary and musical circles. In her house he would have met members of the nobility, writers and musicians. The emperor himself, arriving incognito, was also a frequent visitor.\n\nFriedrich Münter wrote that Gemmingen \"was very influential in the background through his connections with Kaunitz, Swieten and . Backed by other influential freemasons, Gemmingen tried to support Joseph II's policy of reform, using his contributions to the weekly political journals \"Weltmann\" and \"Wahrheiten\" for which, in 1783, he became editor. As editor, he continued to write many of the articles himself, using the pseudonym \"O. H. Edler von Hoffenheim\", a reference to the estate at Hoffenheim which his father had inherited in 1781. There were contributions from other freemasons, and some of the ideas of the \"Illuminati\" (of whom he evidently became one) also found a resonance in the journals. However, his publications attracted some hostility in aristocratic and, more particularly, church circles. The established church in Vienna was still the Roman Catholic Church. One article Gemmingen published appeared under the headline, \"Dabei schaffe sich der Mensch zwischen sich und Gott Mittelwesen, wobei er über diese Gott vergisst\" (\"Thus mankind creates intermediaries [i.e. saint] enabling him to forget about God\"). Another was headed \"Schutzpatrone, Heilige überhaupt und besonders Maria: Was sind dies anderes als Mittelwesen? … Noch ein allgemeiner Zug des Aberglaubens ist die übertriebene Verehrung des Priestertum.\" (\"Protectors, saints in general and the Blessed Mary in particular: These are nothing more than intermediaries - one more piece of pressure to honour the priests excessively\").\n\nGemmingen's time in Viemnna coincided with a struggle in the city's energetic masonic community. This had been unleashed by new types of teaching associated with the reformist \"Strict Observance\" movement, which Gemmingen opposed because of the enhanced role it gave to \"occult mysticism\". This led him to support the creation of a new lodge, respecting the older obligations and the differenatiation between the difference degrees (ranks) of members, along with backing for Enlightenment goals, charity, toloeration, rejection of superstition, and support for the emperor's (pro-enlightenment) reforms by word and deed. That led to the establishment a new lodge based on the so-called . The development was made known in a letter dated 14 February 1783, and Gemmingen himself became Master of the Lodge which received strong backing from the original (itself founded in Vienna in 1781) .\n\nSoon afterwards he became the district lodge secretary for Vienna, with the mandate to draft up some constitutional statutes. It was under these statutes that on 22 April 1784 The Austrian Grand Lodge was set up under the leadership of Prince Dietrichstein. This was seen as a great achievement on Gemmingen's part. By the end of 1784 the \"lodge of good deeds\" (\"Loge Zur Wohltätigkeit\") comprised around 40 members. A highlight was the recruitment of Gemmingen's friend, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, after the composer became aware that Gemmingen was a member of the at that time secret organisation.\n\nAfter he had been appointed editor in chief of \"Wöchentlichen Wahrheiten für und über die Prediger in Wien\" (\"Weekly Truths for and about Priests in Vienna\") in 1783 and, at about the same time, taken charge of \"Der Weltmann\", which was if anything less restrained in discussion of church matters, Gemmingen found himself on the receiving end of attacks from Leopold Alois Hoffmann, founder of \"Wöchentlichen Wahrheiten\" and Gemmingen's predecessor as its editor in chief. Gemmingen's editorial appointments had been made in response to \"orders from on high\", which seems to refer to behind the scenes string pulling on the part of the emperor himself. But now it was Hoffmann who complained that fees due to him had not been paid and promises had not been kept. In fact, Gemmingen had taken care to ensure that Hoffmann received a dispensation meaning that, despite his relative youth, he could become a member of the \"lodge of good deeds\" (\"Loge Zur Wohltätigkeit\"). He also employed Hoffmann as his secretary, and used his influence with his friend Swieten to see to it that Hoffmann received a post as a professor at the University of Pest. In later years Hoffmann acquired a reputation as a leading critic in the media of freemasonry. It is possible that even in 1784 his hostility to Gemmigen was conflated with a negative view of the movement. It is also possible that after publication of \"Wöchentlichen Wahrheiten\" ended on 10 June 1784, Gemmingen could no longer justify (or afford) retaining Hoffmann as his secretary, and Hoffmann's subsequent attacks were a form a \"pay back\".\n\nSince 1783 or earlier Gemmingen had been thinking that the weekly political journals for which he was responsible, targeted on members of the upper classes, were too restricted in their appeal, and in 1784 he launched \"Magazin für Wissenschaften und Literature\" (\"Magazine for Sciences and Literature\"), intended to appeal to the growing ranks of Vienna's bourgeoisie. However, by 1785 this project was abandoned, having failed to interest its intended readership. One source speculates that it was pitched \"at too high a level\". In 1784 financial pressures drove Gemmingen to try and obtain a position at court, but in this he was not successful. Shortly afterwards, on 22 August 1784, he was placed under police surveillance, and his written work was subjected to censorship for the first time. He made one more attempt to launch a political journal with a more popular appeal, this time under the title \"Vienna Ephemeris\". This fared better than his earlier attempt, and was published till 1787, the year in which he left Vienna.\n\nGemmingen's departure from Vienna was sudden and largely unexplained. There are suggestions that he had made too many enemies in the city. He certainly faced financial challenges. These arose in connection with the indebtedness of his brother-in-law, Franz von Sickingen. Gemmingen's wife was certainly always very close to her brother whose approach to his finances seems to have been excessively \"easy going\".\n\nGemmingen's father died on 3 February 1790 and he moved with his family into the patrimonial estate at Hoffenheim, between Heidelberg and Heilbronn. Six weeks later, on 26 March 1790, he issued an \"Ordinance\" which reads like a cross between the constitution for a small state and a set of instructions to his tenants. The details in this prescriptive document document are characterised by practical attention to detail worthy of a German product of the enlightnement. Sources are silent over the implementation phase of the Hoffenheim Ordinance, but by the end of 1790 Gemmingen had sold the Hoffenheim estate to his younger brother, Sigmund, for 40,000 Gulden. On 11 May 1791 he purchased an estate at nearby , on the farther bank of the Rhine, for 36,000 Gulden. In an age before railroads and motorways the river was the principal transport artery for the region, and his new estate was less than an hour away from Mannheim, Heidelberg, Schwetzingen and Speyer. Gemmingen moved in with his family, spending a lot of time in Mannheim on the opposite bank. However, in 1795 the French revolution came to his Maudach estate, the \"revolutionary army\" badly damaging the estate and destroying part of his book collection. With his brother-in-law Franz von Sickingen he now exchanged the Maudach property for an estate at Mühlbach near Karlstadt am Main which was in a slightly less exposed position with regard to marauding armies, and which he had inherited via his wife.\n\nIn 1799 Gemmingen was sent on a special mission to Vienna on behalf of the court. In Vienna his initial reception was cool. Enlightenment principals had lost their appeal in the light of the French Revolution and the Emperor Joseph had died in 1790, but there were many in the political establishment who still remembered Gemmingen from his time in Vienna during the 1780s. However, his diplomatic skills soon won him recognition at the court. The Margrave of Baden was more than pleased with his performance and appointed him a permanent plenipotentiary to the Court at Vienna, for which he received annual remuneration of 22,000 Gulden.\n\nWith Napoleon's decisive victory at Austerlitz, Baden benefitted substantially from the French empoeror's favour, its territory substantially enlarged as it became the Grand Duchy of Baden, a development in which Gemmingen played his part.\n\nAfter 1806 Gemingen returned to Mühlbach with his family, spending the last three decades of his life away from public life and increasingly impoverished. His high level of indebtedness mey have resulted from excessive cash tranasfers and guarnatees on behalf of his impecunious brother in law. He then attempted to increase his income by increasing the charges on the tenant farmers on the estates. This met with particularly strong resistance at Hoffenheim where at one stage troops had to be called in and set on the tenants. His own financial difficulties led him to forget earlier backing for unjustly treated peasants. In 1817 the estate at Mühlbach had to be given up and he moved back, briefly, to Hoffenheim, and then to Heidelberg where, in 1819, he was obliged to file for bankruptcy. When the were computed he was found to have debts in excess of 200,000 Gulden and the Mannheim High Court was obliged to intervene. His wife died in 1826, and he died ten years later, completely impoverished. He retained only a small collection of books. During his final years this once esteemed enlightement write and diplomat fell into a level of obscurity from which his reputation has not yet recovered.\n\n"}
{"id": "248256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248256", "title": "Principle of double effect", "text": "Principle of double effect\n\nThe principle of double effect—also known as the rule of double effect; the doctrine of double effect, often abbreviated as DDE or PDE, double-effect reasoning; or simply double effect—is a set of ethical criteria which Christian philosophers, and some others, have advocated for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one's otherwise legitimate act (for example, relieving a terminally ill patient's pain) may also cause an effect one would otherwise be obliged to avoid (sedation and a slightly shortened life). The first known example of double-effect reasoning is Thomas Aquinas' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work \"Summa Theologica\".\n\nThis set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true:\n\nThe principle of double effect is based on the idea that there is a morally relevant difference between an \"intended\" consequence of an act and one that is foreseen by the actor but not calculated to achieve his motive. So, for example, the principle is invoked to consider the terror bombing of non-combatants having as its goal victory in a legitimate war morally out of bounds, while holding as ethically in bounds an act of strategic bombing that similarly harms non-combatants with foresight as a side effect of destroying a legitimate military target. Because advocates of double effect propose that consequentially similar acts can be morally different, double effect is most often criticized by consequentialists who consider the consequences of actions entirely determinative of the action's morality.\n\nIn their use of the distinction between intent and foresight without intent, advocates of double effect make three arguments. First, that intent differs from foresight, even in cases in which one foresees an effect as inevitable. Second, that one can apply the distinction to specific sets of cases found in military ethics (terror bombing/strategic bombing), medical ethics (craniotomy/hysterectomy), and social ethics (euthanasia). Third, that the distinction has moral relevance, importance, or significance.\n\nThe doctrine consists of four conditions that must be satisfied before an act is morally permissible:\n\n\nThe second of these four conditions is an application of the more general principle that good ends do not justify evil means.\n\nThe principle of double effect is frequently cited in cases of pregnancy and abortion. A doctor who believes abortion is always morally wrong may still remove the uterus or fallopian tubes of a pregnant woman, knowing the procedure will cause the death of the embryo or fetus, in cases in which the woman is certain to die without the procedure (examples cited include aggressive uterine cancer and ectopic pregnancy). In these cases, the intended effect is to save the woman's life, not to terminate the pregnancy, and the effect of not performing the procedure would result in the greater evil of the death of both the mother and the foetus.\n\nIn cases of terminally ill patients who would hasten their deaths because of unbearable pain, or whose caregivers would do so for them (euthanasia, medical aid in dying, etc.), a principle of \"double effect death\" could be applied to justify the deliberate administration of a pain-killer in potentially unsafe doses—not in an attempt to end life but the pain suffered is considered harmful to the patient. The U.S. Supreme Court has voiced support for this principle in its deliberations over the constitutionality of medical aid in dying.\n\nConsequentialists, in particular, reject the notion that two acts can differ in their moral permissibility if both have exactly the same consequences, or expected consequences. John Stuart Mill, a nineteenth-century advocate of the utilitarian version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: \"He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations.\" According to Mill, scrutiny of motives will show that almost all good behavior proceeds from questionable intentions. Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and unintended consequences. Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions.\n\n\n"}

In 1984, Vujcic was imprisoned in Tuzla for seven days (for his writing and criticizing of Yugoslavia's communist regime) where he wrote his second book of poetry titled \"Kastriranje vetra\" which was also banned by the Communist government.\n\nIn January 1987, Vujcic moved to Canada. Upon arrival in Canada, he helped raise funds for the construction of the Church of Saint Sava in Belgrade and the Živojin Mišić monument in Mionica. On 28 June 1989, Vujcic helped organize the 600th Anniversary Ceremony commemorating the Battle of Kosovo throughout Canada. The \"Canada Gazette\" wrote about Vujcic and his beginnings in Canada in a 1989 edition. In 1992, he founded the United Serbs FC soccer club for which he and Mike Stojanović played (as a child, Vujcic played soccer in the youth categories of FK Železničar Požarevac). During this period, Vujcic was a contributor to Serbian magazine \"Pogledi\". In 1999, he was one of the organizers of the Toronto-based demonstrations against the bombing of Serbia and Montenegro. In terms of the Serbian diaspora, the demonstrations lasted all 78 days only in Toronto.\n\nVujcic is a member of the Association of Writers of Serbia, the Royal Canadian Legion, the Canadian Association of Journalists, the Serbian Literary Society, the Association of Writers of Republika Srpska and the US-based International Association of Writers. In 2007, the International Association of Writers named him a Poetry Ambassador of the United States. He is also an honourable member of the Desanka Maksimović Serbian Canadian Association. Vujcic is featured in the book \"Moždana veza sa Srbijom, 100 dragulja srpskog rasejanja\" (\"Brain Connection with Serbia, 100 Jewels of the Serbian Diaspora)\" by Radivoje Petrović, PhD. The book features the \"one hundred most-known Serbs throughout the world-wide Serbian diaspora.\" He was also featured on the cover of the Ministry of Diaspora of the Republic of Serbia book called \"U čast pisaca iz rasejanja / In honour of writers in the diaspora\" in which literary critics Miodrag Perišić and Čedomir Mirković said that \"Vujcic is one of the most significant living Serbian poets and dissidents.\"\n\nHe is the founder of the Urban Book Circle, based in Canada.\n\n\nVujcic has four children.\n\n"}

{"id": "97511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97511", "title": "Shangdi", "text": "Shangdi\n\nShangdi (), also written simply, \"Emperor\" (), is the Chinese term for \"Supreme Deity\" or \"Highest Deity\" in the theology of the classical texts, especially deriving from Shang theology and finding an equivalent in the later \"Tian\" (\"Heaven\" or \"Great Whole\") of Zhou theology.\n\nAlthough in Chinese religion the usage of \"Tian\" to refer to the absolute God of the universe is predominant, \"Shangdi\" continues to be used in a variety of traditions, including certain philosophical schools, certain strains of Confucianism, some Chinese salvationist religions (notably Yiguandao) and Chinese Protestant Christianity. In addition, it is common to use such term among contemporary and secular Chinese, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese societies typically for a singular universal deity and a non-religion translation for the God in Christianity.\n\n\"Shang Di\" is the pinyin romanization of two Chinese characters. The first , \"Shàng\" means \"high\", \"highest\", \"first\", \"primordial\"; the second , \"Dì\" is typically considered as a short hand for \"huangdi\" （皇帝）in modern Chinese, the title of the emperors of China first employed by Qin Shi Huang, and is usually translated as \"emperor\". The word itself is derived from Three \"Huang\" and Five \"Di\", including Yellow Emperor (Huangdi 黃帝), the mythological originator of the Chinese civilization and the ancestor of the Chinese race. However, 帝 refers to the High God of Shang, thus means \"deity\" (manifested god), . Thus, the name \"Shangdi\" should be translated as \"Highest Deity\", but also have the implied meaning of \"Primordial Deity\" or \"First Deity\" in Classical Chinese. The deity preceded the title and the emperors of China were named after him in their role as \"Tianzi\", the sons of Heaven. In the classical texts the highest conception of the heavens is frequently identified with Shang Di, who is described somewhat anthropomorphically. He is also associated with the pole star. The conceptions of the Supreme Ruler (Shang Di) and of the Sublime Heavens (Huang-t'ien)afterward coalesce or absorb each other.\n\nThe earliest references to Shangdi are found in oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty in the 2nd millennium BC, although the later work \"Classic of History\" claims yearly sacrifices were made to him by Emperor Shun, even before the Xia Dynasty.\n\nShangdi was regarded as the ultimate spiritual power by the ruling elite of the Huaxia during the Shang dynasty: he was believed to control victory in battle, success or failure of harvests, weather conditions such as the floods of the Yellow River, and the fate of the kingdom. Shangdi seems to have ruled a hierarchy of other gods controlling nature, as well as the spirits of the deceased. These ideas were later mirrored or carried on by the Taoist Jade Emperor and his celestial bureaucracy.\n\nShangdi was probably more transcendental than immanent, only working through lesser gods. Shangdi was considered too distant to be worshiped directly by ordinary mortals. Instead, the Shang kings proclaimed that Shangdi had made himself accessible through the souls of their royal ancestors, both in the legendary past and in recent generations as the departed Shang kings joined him in the afterlife. The emperors could thus successfully entreat Shangdi directly. Many of the oracle bone inscriptions record these petitions, usually praying for rain but also seeking approval from Shangdi for state action.\n\nIn the later Shang and Zhou dynasties, Shangdi was conflated with Heaven (, \"Tiān\"). The Duke of Zhou justified his clan's usurpation through the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, which proposed that the protection of Shangdi was not connected to their clan membership but by their just governance. Shangdi was not just a tribal but instead an unambiguously good moral force, exercising its power according to exacting standards. It could thus be lost and even \"inherited\" by a new dynasty, provided they upheld the proper rituals.\n\nNonetheless, the connection of many rituals with the Shang clan meant that Shang nobles continued to rule several locations (despite their rebellions) and to serve as court advisors and priests. The Duke of Zhou even created an entire ceremonial city along strict cosmological principals to house the Shang aristocracy and the nine tripods representing Huaxia sovereignty; the Shang were then charged with maintaining the \"Rites of Zhou\". Likewise, the Shang's lesser houses, the \"shi\" knightly class, developed directly into the learned Confucian gentry and scholars who advised the Zhou rulers on courtly etiquette and ceremony. The Confucian classics carried on and ordered the earlier traditions, including the worship of Shangdi. All of them include references:\n\nThe Four Books mention Shangdi as well but, as it is a later compilation, the references are much more sparse and abstract. Shangdi appears most commonly in earlier works: this pattern may reflect increasing rationalization of Shangdi over time, the shift from a known and arbitrary tribal god to a more abstract and philosophical concept, or his conflation and absorption by other deities.\n\nBy the time of the Han dynasty, the influential Confucian scholar Zheng Xuan glossed: \"\"Shangdi\" is another name for Heaven\". Dong Zhongshu said: \"Heaven is the ultimate authority, the king of gods who should be admired by the king\".\n\nIn later eras, he was commonly known by the name \"Heavenly Ruling Highest Deity\" (皇天上帝, \"Huángtiān Shàngdì\") and, in this usage, he is especially conflated with the Taoist Jade Emperor.\n\nIn Shang sources, Di is already described as the supreme ordainer of the events which occur in nature, such as wind, lightning and thunder, and in human affairs and politics. All the gods of nature are conceived as his envoys or manifestations. Shang sources also attest his cosmological Five Ministries. Di, or Tian, as later texts explain, did not receive cult for being too remote for living humans to sacrifice to directly. Instead, an intermediary such as an ancestor was necessary to convey to Di the offerings of the living.\n\nAccording to some prominent scholars, including Guo Moruo, Shangdi was originally identical to Ku (or Kui) or Diku (\"\"Divus\" Ku\"), the progenitor (first ancestor) of the Zi (子) lineage, the founders of the Shang dynasty, attested in the \"Shiji\" and other texts. According to this interpretation, this identification had profound political implications, because it meant that the earthly Shang kings were themselves by birth aspects of divinity.\n\nFurther evidence from Shang sources suggests that there wasn't a complete identification between the two, as Di controls spirits of nature, while Kui does not; Di is frequently pictured sending down \"approvals\", while Kui is never so pictured; and Kui received cult, while Di did not. Moreover, Kui is frequently appealed in \"horizontal\" relationship with other powers, undermining any portrait of him as the apex of the pantheon.\n\nDavid Pankenier has studied the astral connections of Shangdi, drawing on a view that interest in the sky was a focal character of the religious practices of the Shang, but also of the earlier Xia and Erlitou cultures. Especially intriguing is the fact that palatial and ceremonial structures of these cultures were carefully aligned to the celestial pole and the procession of pole stars. Pankenier notes that the true celestial pole lies in a sky template which is vacant of significant stars, and that the various pole stars are those nearest to this vacant apex which is of crucial importance.\n\nHe illustrates how the Shang oracular script for Di can be projected on the north pole template of the ancient sky in such a way that its extremity points correspond with the visible star, while the intersection of the linear axes at the centre will map to the vacant celestial pole. Pankenier argues that the supreme Di was identified with the celestial pole, an idea familiar in later stages of Chinese religion, linking with the \"Tàiyī\" 太一 (\"Great One\") fully documented as early as the 4th century BCE.\n\nThe interpretation of Shangdi as the celestial pole, Taiyi and as Ku the progenitor of the Shang is not contradictory. Feng Shi argues that Ku and Di are indeed identical. The Shang probably deliberately identified their ancestor with a universal god recognized in different regions and local cultures in order to legitimize their power.\n\nContemporary Confucian theologians have emphasised differences between the Confucian idea of Shangdi, conceived as both transcendent and immanent, and act only as a governor of the world, and the Christian idea of God, which they conceived contrary to those of Christian as a deity that is completely otherwordly (transcendent) and is merely a creator of the world.\n\nAs mentioned above, sacrifices offered to Shangdi by the king are claimed by traditional Chinese histories to predate the Xia dynasty. The surviving archaeological record shows that by the Shang, the shoulder blades of sacrificed oxen were used to send questions or communication through fire and smoke to the divine realm, a practice known as scapulimancy. The heat would cause the bones to crack and royal diviners would interpret the marks as Shangdi's response to the king. Inscriptions used for divination were buried into special orderly pits, while those that were for practice or records were buried in common middens after use.\n\nUnder Shangdi or his later names, the deity received sacrifices from the ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty annually at a great Temple of Heaven in the imperial capital. Following the principles of Chinese geomancy, this would always be located in the southern quarter of the city. During the ritual, a completely healthy bull would be slaughtered and presented as an animal sacrifice to Shangdi. The \"Book of Rites\" states the sacrifice should occur on the \"longest day\" on a round-mound altar. The altar would have three tiers: the highest for Shangdi and the Son of Heaven; the second-highest for the sun and moon; and the lowest for the natural gods such as the stars, clouds, rain, wind, and thunder.\n\nIt is important to note that Shangdi is never represented with either images or idols. Instead, in the center building of the Temple of Heaven, in a structure called the \"Imperial Vault of Heaven\", a \"spirit tablet\" (神位, shénwèi) inscribed with the name of Shangdi is stored on the throne, \"Huangtian Shangdi\" (皇天上帝). During an annual sacrifice, the emperor would carry these tablets to the north part of the Temple of Heaven, a place called the \"Prayer Hall For Good Harvests\", and place them on that throne.\n\nIt was during Ming and Qing dynasty, when Roman Catholicism was introduced by Jesuit Priest Matteo Ricci, that the idea of \"Shangdi\" started to be applied to the Christian conception of God.\n\nWhile initially he utilized the term \"Tianzhu\", Ricci gradually changed the translation into \"Shangdi\" instead. His usage of Shangdi was contested by Confucians, as they believed that the concept of \"Tian\" and \"Shangdi\" is different from that of Christian's God: Zhōng Shǐ-shēng, through his books, stated that Shangdi only governs, while Christian's God is a creator, and thus differ. Ricci's translation also invited the displeasure of Dominicans and that of the Roman Curia; On March 19, 1715, Pope Clement XI released the Edict \"Ex Illa Die\", stating that Catholics must use \"Tianzhu\" instead of \"Shangdi\" for Christianity's God.\n\nWhen Protestantism entered China in the mid of 19th century, the Protestant missionaries also encountered a similar issue; some preferred the term \"Shangdi\", while some preferred the term \"Shen\" (god). A conference held in 1877 in Shanghai, discussing the translation issue, also believed that \"Shangdi\" of Confucianism and the Christian concept of God are different in nature.\n\nHowever, by the 20th century, most British missionaries, some Catholics, Chinese Orthodox Christians, and Evangelicals preferred Shangdi as a connection with Chinese native monotheism with some further the argument by linking it with the unknown god as described in bible passage of . Catholics preferred to avoid it, due to compromises with the local authority in order to do their missions, as well as fear such translation may associate the Christian God to Chinese polytheism.\n\nNowadays, through the secular Chinese-language media, the Chinese word of \"Shangdi\" and \"Tian\" are frequently used to as a translation for the singular universal deity with minimal religious attachment to the Christian idea of God, while Confucians and intellectuals in contemporary mainland China and Taiwan attempt to realign the term to its original meaning. The Catholics officially use the term Tianzhu (Chinese: 天主, Tiānzhǔ), lit. \"The Lord of Heaven\", while Evangelicals typically utilize Shangdi (上帝) and/or Shen (神, \"The God\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "898990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=898990", "title": "The Rebel (book)", "text": "The Rebel (book)\n\nThe Rebel () is a 1951 book-length essay by Albert Camus, which treats both the metaphysical and the historical development of rebellion and revolution in societies, especially Western Europe. Camus relates writers and artists as diverse as Epicurus and Lucretius, the Marquis de Sade, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Stirner, André Breton, and others in an integrated, historical portrait of man in revolt. Examining both rebellion and revolt, which may be seen as the same phenomenon in personal and social frames, Camus examines several 'countercultural' figures and movements from the history of Western thought and art, noting the importance of each in the overall development of revolutionary thought and philosophy. This work has received ongoing interest, influencing modern philosophers and authors such as Paul Berman and others.\n\nFred Rosen has examined the influence of ideas of Simone Weil on Camus' thinking in \"The Rebel\". George F Selfer has analysed parallels between Camus and Friedrich Nietzsche in philosophical aesthestics.\n\nOne of Camus' primary arguments in \"The Rebel\" concerns the motivation for rebellion and revolution. While the two acts - which can be interpreted from Camus' writing as states of being - are radically different in most respects, they both stem from a basic human rejection of normative justice. If human beings become disenchanted with contemporary applications of justice, Camus suggests that they rebel. This rebellion, then, is the product of a basic contradiction between the human mind's unceasing quest for clarification and the apparently meaningless nature of the world. Described by Camus as \"absurd,\" this latter perception must be examined with what Camus terms \"lucidity.\" Camus concludes that such an 'absurdist' sensibility contradicts itself because when it claims to believe in nothing, it believes in its own protest and in the value of the protester's life. Therefore, this sensibility is logically a \"point of departure\" that irresistibly \"exceeds itself.\" In the inborn impulse to rebel, on the other hand, we can deduce values that enable us to determine that murder and oppression are illegitimate and conclude with \"hope for a new creation.\" \n\nAnother prominent theme in \"The Rebel\", which is tied to the notion of incipient rebellion, is the inevitable failure of attempts at human perfection. Through an examination of various titular revolutions, and in particular the French Revolution, Camus argues that most revolutions involved a fundamental denial of both history and transcendental values. Such revolutionaries aimed to kill God. In the French Revolution, for instance, this was achieved through the execution of Louis XVI and subsequent eradication of the divine right of kings. The subsequent rise of utopian and materialist idealism sought \"the end of history.\" Because this end is unattainable, according to Camus, terror ensued as the revolutionaries attempted to coerce results. This culminated in the \"temporary\" enslaving of people in the name of their future liberation. Notably, Camus' reliance on non-secular sentiment does not involve a defense of religion; indeed, the replacement of divinely-justified morality with pragmatism simply represents Camus' apotheosis of transcendental, moral values.\n\nFaced with the manifest injustices of human existence on one hand, and the poor substitute of revolution on the other, Camus' rebel seeks to fight for justice without abandoning transcendental values, including the principle of the intrinsic value of human life. Consequently, of all the modern revolutionaries, Camus admires the \"fastidious assassins\", namely the Russian terrorists led by Kalyayev, active in the early twentieth century were prepared to offer their own lives as payment for the lives they took, rather than licensing others to kill others.\n\nA third is that of crime, as Camus discusses how rebels who get carried away lose touch with the original basis of their rebellion and offer various defenses of crime through various historical epochs.\n\nAt the end of the book, Camus espouses the possible moral superiority of the ethics and political plan of syndicalism. He grounds this politics in a wider \"midday thought\" which opposes love of this life, and an unrelativisable normative commitment to fellow human beings, against ideological promises of the other world, end of history, or triumph of an alleged master race.\n"}
{"id": "57688660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57688660", "title": "Theosophy and science", "text": "Theosophy and science\n\nImmediately after formation the Theosophical Society in 1875, the founders of modern Theosophy were aimed to show that their ideas can be confirmed by science. According to professor Olav Hammer, at the end of the 19th century the Theosophical doctrine has acquired in Europe and America wide popularity, thanking to numerous publications, which contained its simplified exposition and, in particular, asserted that Theosophy \"includes\" both science and religion, thus, positioning itself as \"a scientific religion,\" or \"a religious science.\" Professor Joscelyn Godwin wrote that the Theosophical Society was formed at the \"crucial historical moment when it seemed possible to unite science and occultism, West and East\" in modern Theosophy, adding into western civilization the esoteric eastern wisdom.\n\nFor the modern Theosophy, which Hammer considered as a standard of the esoteric tradition, conventional science is called upon to play \"two diametrically opposite roles.\" On the one hand, Theosophy has always expressed its clearly negative attitude towards it. On the other hand, in the process of building the occult doctrine, it gave to certain fragments of scientific discourse the status of valued elements. In this case, science was not used as an object of criticism, but as \"a basis of legitimacy and source of doctrinal elements.\" Thus, in Hammer's opinion, the main goal was achieved: the doctrine acquired a \"scientistic\" appearance.\n\nThe Theosophical Society proclaimed its third main task, \"To investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man.\" Thus, it set itself one of its goals to investigate phenomena whose existence itself is highly controversial, that is, the very premises of Theosophy have become \"fertile ground\" for the search for \"scientistic formulations.\" Scientism and the ambivalence relation to science were already evident in the first Theosophical publications. It can be seen in both Blavatsky's early articles, and in \"Isis Unveiled,\" the book that became the \"first full-scale attempt\" to create the Theosophical doctrine, where she stated that Theosophy does not contradict science, but is, in fact, a \"higher form of science\", in comparison with what is usually understood by this term. This statement by Blavatsky is quoted in Hammer's thesis:\nThe exercise of \"magical\" power is the exercise of \"natural\" powers, but superior to the ordinary functions of Nature. A miracle is not a violation of the laws of Nature, except for ignorant people. Magic is but a \"science,\" a profound knowledge of the Occult forces in Nature, and of the laws governing the visible or the invisible world... A powerful mesmerizer, profoundly learned in his science, such as Baron du Potet, Regazzoni, Pietro d'Amicis of Bologna, are \"magicians,\" for they have become the adepts, the initiated ones, into the great mystery of our Mother Nature.\"\n\nA dual relation of Blavatsky to science remained unchanged, in Hammer's opinion, throughout her theosophical career. It was manifested also in the mahatma letters and later continued in \"The Secret Doctrine.\" In one of the letters, terms and theories of the conventional science are characterized with words such as \"misleading\", \"vacillating\", \"uncertain\" and \"incomplete\". It is this last word that is most important, that is, \"science is a half-truth.\" The Theosophical doctrine \"not so much\" denies the truth of science, how much condemns its inability to explain an essence of the spiritual processes that \"are supposedly the real causes\" of the physical and chemical phenomena. According to Hammer, \"The Secret Doctrine\" is completely \"imbued with the rhetoric of scientism\". Although the \"basic cosmological\" concept in this work ultimately derives \"from ancient wisdom\" that was received by Blavatsky, as she claimed, from her \"Masters,\" many of the details of this declassified cosmology are accompanied by references to archaeological discoveries, modern biological theories such as evolutionary theory of Haeckel, etc. She believed that the positioning of Theosophy in relation to science is of great importance, and the third parts of both the 1st and 2nd volumes of her book have the common heading \"Science and the Secret Doctrine Contrasted.\" These sections are devoted both to the refutation of the conventional science, and to the search in it the support of occult teachings. Blavatsky repeatedly returned to the assertion that modern physical sciences point to the same reality as the esoteric doctrines:\n\"If there is anything on earth like progress, Science will some day have to give up, \"nolens volens,\" such monstrous ideas as her physical, self-guiding \"laws\"—void of soul and Spirit,—and then turn to the occult teachings. It has done so already, however altered are the title-page and revised editions of the Scientific Catechism.\"\n\nBlavatsky generally did not reject science, suggesting the possibility of \"reconciliation\" of science and Theosophy. She believed that they have \"important common grounds\", and that the \"weaknesses\" of the traditional science are only its \"temporary shortcomings.\" The main point of contact, which unites science and \"occultism\" against the common enemy, a dogmatic religion, was the refusal to recognize \"unknowable, absolutely transcendent causes.\" Theosophical cosmos appears and disappears in an infinite sequence of \"cycles of evolution and involution.\" This is pantheistic position, because the beginning of this process does not require \"transcendent God.\" Hammer has cited:\n\"Well may a man of science ask himself, 'What power is it that directs each atom?' <...> Theists would solve the question by answering 'God'; and would solve nothing philosophically. Occultism answers on its own pantheistic grounds.\"\n\nIn his thesis Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that, criticizing science of the 19th century, the Theosophists claimed on the \"futility\" its attempts to adequately explain \"the greatest enigmas\" of Universe. They evaluated the \"occult based\" hypotheses as more accurate than those presented by science.\n\nHammer wrote Blavatsky defined her position regarding science \"from the beginning of her theosophical career.\" Thus, the \"Mahatma Letters\" contain, in his opinion, the \"rather unsystematic\" accusations the modern science and the fragments of the occult doctrine, supposedly \"far superior\" the scientific ideas of the day. The essence of Blavatsky's \"later argument\" is anticipated in the next passage from letter No. 11: \"Modern science is our best ally. Yet it is generally that same science which is made the enemy to break our heads with.\" She constantly condemned the traditional science as \"limited, materialistic and prejudiced\" and blamed in this the famous thinkers and scholars. Bacon was the first among the culprits \"due to the materialism of his method, 'the general tenor' of his writing and, more specifically, his misunderstanding of spiritual evolution.\" Newton's materialist error allegedly consisted in the fact that in his law of gravitation the primary was the power, not the influence of the \"spiritual causes.\" In addition, she repeated the baseless, according to Hammer, assertion that Newton came to his ideas after reading Böhme.\n\nAn American author Joseph Tyson wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the mechanistic science's adepts of her time were the \"animate corpses.\" She wrote that \"they have no spiritual sight because their spirits have left them.\" She called their hypotheses \"the sophisms suggested by cold reason,\" which future generations would banish to the \"limbo of exploded myths.\" Also Henry Olcott proclaimed that the Theosophists must break \"the walls of incredulous and despotic Western science.\"\n\nSome scientists, according to Blavatsky, were more prone to spiritual, and she \"selectively approved\" them. \"The positive side of Descartes' work\" was supposedly his faith in the \"magnetic doctrine\" and alchemy, although he was a \"worshipper of matter.\" She was admired by Kepler's method, \"combining scientific and esoteric thought.\" She gave also some excerpts from Newton's most \"speculative\" works, where he supports a \"spiritualized\" approach to gravity. Thus, according to her words, these \"greatest scientists\" rediscovered the esoteric knowledge already available to \"Western occultists including Paracelsus... kabbalists and alchemists.\"\n\nA religious studies scholar Alvin Kuhn wrote Blavatsky claimed in \"The Secret Doctrine\" that occultism does not combat with conventional science, when \"the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact.\" But when its opponents try \"to wrench the formation of Kosmos... from Spirit, and attribute all to blind matter, that the Occultists claim the right to dispute and call in question their theories.\" She stated that \"science is limited\" to researching one aspect of human life that relates to the sphere of material nature. \"There are other aspects\" of this life—metaphysical, supersensory, for the knowledge of which science has no tools. Science devotes its strength to the study of vital forces, which are expressed in a phenomenal or sensual area. Consequently, it sees nothing but the residual effects of such forces. \"These are but the shadow of reality,\" Blavatsky claimed. Thus, science deals \"only with appearances\" and hints of life, and that is all that it is capable of until the postulates of the occult are recognized. Science is tied to \"the plane of effects\", but occultism is take to \"the plane of causes.\" Science \"studies the expression of life\", esotericism sees life itself. So that the scientist can learn \"the elements of real causality\", he will have to develop in himself such abilities which today almost all Europeans and Americans absolutely lack. There is no other way to get enough facts to substantiate his conclusions.\n\nTim Rudbøg wrote in his thesis: \"A large part of Blavatsky's critique of modern science consisted in the critical view that many of these so-called new discoveries and theories were actually known to the ancients, but lost to the moderns due to their arrogance. In other words, any 'new' discovery was, to a large extent, simply 'old wine in new bottles'.\"\n\nModern Theosophy, as professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke stated, \"adapting contemporary scientific ideas,\" raised the concept of \"spiritual evolution through countless worlds and eras.\" According to professor Donald Lopez, the occult \"system of spiritual evolution\" was more profound and advanced than that proposed by Charles Darwin. Theosophists accepted his theory but rejected the assertion that life originated from matter, and not from spirit.\n\nKuhn wrote that, according to Blavatsky, between the spiritual evolution of man and his physical development \"there is an abyss which will not be easily crossed by any man in the full possession of his intellectual faculties.\" Physical development, \"as modern Science teaches it, is a subject for open controversy; spiritual and moral development on the same lines is the insane dream of a crass materialism.\" Darwinian theory and the materialistic science suggest that the development of matter in an organic form leads to the emergence of the psyche and intelligence as the products of two elements: matter and energy. Occultism claims that such a process can lead to the creation of physical forms only. Instead of considering intellect and consciousness as properties of evolved organisms, Theosophy speaks of a \"spiritual evolution\" as a concomitant biological one and associated with it. \"Evolution in its higher aspect\" can't be explained if its factors are reduced to blind material forces arising under the impact of the \"mechanical influences of environment.\"\n\nAn American author Gary Lachman wrote that, according to Blavatsky, the \"scientific\" theory of evolution reflects only that part of it that takes place in our present physical world. Darwinism does not take into account what happens before and after. In her opinion, Darwin \"begins his evolution of species at the lowest point and traces upward. His only mistake may be that he applies his system at the wrong end.\" After passing through the period of necessary separation, the spirit returns to itself enriched during its journey. Consequently, the biological evolution is not a \"random\" event that could \"occur\" due to some \"rare\" combination of chemical matters and then continued driven by the need for survival and suitable mutations. Blavatsky claimed that, not spirit is in matter, but on the contrary, \"matter\" \"clings temporarily to spirit.\" Thus, the spirit (or consciousness) is primary, and matter is a temporary means used in its \"work.\" According to Theosophy, evolution is the basic phenomenon of the Universe that does not coincide with the materialistic vision, which, in Blavatsky's opinion, is \"a hideous, ceaseless procession of sparks of cosmic matter created by \"no one\"... floating onward from \"nowhence\"... and it rushes \"nowhither\".\" She proposed the kabalistic scheme of evolution: \"A stone becomes a plant; a plant a beast; a beast a \"man\"; a man a \"spirit\"; and the spirit a god.\" In this scheme: \"Each perfected species in the physical evolution only affords more scope to the directing intelligence to act within the improved nervous system.\"\n\nAccording to words of Dimitry Drujinin, Olcott claimed, \"Theosophy shows the student that evolution is a fact, but that it has not been partial and incomplete as Darwin's theory makes it.\" Professor Iqbal Taimni wrote that, it is not known to science that the main goal \"of the evolution of forms\" is to obtain more effective means for the development of the mind and \"unfolding consciousness.\" This barbarism is quite standard because the ordinary scientists decline to view everything that is \"invisible\" and can't be investigated \"by purely physical means.\" Occultism allows one to obtain the \"missing knowledge\" and makes the concept of the evolution of forms not only more complete, but also explains the cause of the entire process, without which it seems completely meaningless.\n\nIn 1888, the president of the Theosophical Society Henry Olcott met in Oxford with Max Müller, \"the father of the 'Science of religion',\" as Lopez named his. Olcott wrote later in his diary that professor Müller, in a conversation with him, highly appreciated the work of Theosophists in translating and re-publishing the sacred books of the East. \"But as for our more cherished activities,\" Olcott wrote, \"the discovery and spread of ancient views on the existence of Siddhas and of the \"siddhis\" in man, he was utterly incredulous.\" In Müller's opinion, nor in the Vedas, nor in the Upanishads there are any esoteric overtones announced by the Theosophists, and they only sacrifice their reputation, pandering \"to the superstitious belief of the Hindus in such follies.\" In response to Olcott's attempt to argue his point of view by references to the Gupta-Vidya and Patanjali the professor said, \"We had better change the subject.\" The president has remembered well not only this conversation, but also \"two marble statuettes of the Buddha sitting in meditation, placed to the right and left of the fireplace.\" He noted this fact, having written in his diary in brackets: \"Buddhists take notice.\"\n\nProfessor Lopez claimed that this was a significant meeting, because both, Buddhist Olcott, and the Buddhist studies scholar Müller, although both were directly related to Buddhism, nevertheless took different positions and lived in different worlds. The world of Olcott, an American emigre and convinced Theosophist \"no formal training in the classical languages of Buddhism\", but who was knowing well both the Buddhist world, and many reputable monks, collided with the world of Müller, a German emigre and outstanding sanskritologist, who was reading \"Buddhist manuscripts in the original Sanskrit and Pali,\" and however failed to recognize theirs esoteric meaning and \"never traveled beyond Europe.\" In Asia, Olcott faced with Buddhist superstition, which is why he argued with some of the leading monks of Sri Lanka. But he deeply revered the Buddhist mores. After his travels through the countries of Asia, he knew that for Buddhists it was absolutely unacceptable and offensive to place anything connected with dharma on the floor [or even on a chair]. Moreover, he knew that Buddhists \"would never place a statue of the Buddha on the floor.\" \n\nOlcott asked all the same of the origin of these statuettes and inquired about their placement. Müller answered that \"the statues of the Buddha\" standing on the floor near his fireplace were taken out of \"the great temple of Rangoon (presumably the Shwedagon).\" The professor was so imbued with the British imperialism, as Lopez noted, that he was not at all embarrassed to use the military trophies captured in the Buddhist temple. The \"more interesting\" was Müller's answer to the question why he put the Buddha statues on the floor: \"Because with the Greeks the hearth was the most sacred spot.\" According to Lopez, the answer \"sounds slightly disingenuous, but its implication is important.\" For Müller, the image of the Buddha, captured in Asia and taken to England, has ceased to be Asian, and therefore its owner was not obliged allegedly to follow the \"Asian custom.\" For him, the Buddha became part \"of European culture, like a Greek god,\" and therefore he should follow the customs of Western civilization.\n\nFive years after the meeting with Olcott, professor Müller published an article \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" in which he tried again, in a different form, to prove that there is no esotericism in Buddhism and never was. All his indignation the professor directed against Blavatsky, believing that the Buddhist esotericism is only her invention. \"I love Buddha and admire Buddhist morality\", Müller wrote, \"that I cannot remain silent when I see his noble figure lowered to the level of religious charlatans, or his teaching misrepresented as esoteric twaddle.\" Theosophists often disagreed with the European Orientalists and ridiculed their limitation. In 1882, in his letter to Alfred Sinnett mahatma Kuthumi offered, \"Since those gentlemen—the Orientalists—presume to give to the world their \"soi-disant\" translations and commentaries on our sacred books, let the theosophists show the great ignorance of those 'world' pundits, by giving the public the right doctrines and explanations of what they would regard as an absurd, fancy theory.\"\n\nFor Hindus, the supernatural powers of a person, who was specially trained, aren't something special. Professor Radhakrishnan noted that in Indian psychology \"the psychic experiences, such as telepathy and clairvoyance, were considered to be neither abnormal nor miraculous.\"\n\nKuhn wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, to consider magic as a deception is to offend humanity: \"To believe that for so many thousands of years, one-half of mankind practiced deception and fraud on the other half, is equivalent to saying that the human race was composed only of knaves and incurable idiots.\" However, according to the Theosophical Masters, the \"recent persecutions\" for alleged witchcraft, magic, mediumship convincingly show that the \"only salvation\" of the genuine occultists lies in the public skepticism, because the attribution to the \"charlatans and the jugglers\" securely protects them.\n\nA member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Eugene Alexandrov argued that the paranormal phenomena don't exist. He wrote, \"There is no telepathy (a transmission and reading of thoughts), there is no clairvoyance, levitation is impossible, there is no 'dowsing', there is no phenomena of a 'poltergeist', there is no psychokinesis.\" As Edi Bilimoria wrote, a typical western scientist don't distinguish (or can't distinguish) two things: a \"map\" (the scientific model of the world) and \"territory\" (Nature). \n\nA religious studies scholar Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that in this work Blavatsky outlines her \"typical\" views about science.\n\nKalnitsky wrote that at the beginning of her article, Blavatsky distinguishes \"modern science\" from \"esoteric science\", and argues that the methodology of the latter is preferable because it ultimately has a more practical, solid basis. He cited the passage from hers article:\n\"Every new discovery made by modern science vindicates the truths of the archaic philosophy. The true occultist is acquainted with no single problem that esoteric science is unable to solve, if approached in the right direction.\"\nHe concluded Blavatsky considers modern science to be a form of the \"archaic philosophy\", which, as a synthesized worldview, includes the \"esoteric science.\" According to her, this is the position of the \"true occultist,\" who can solve any problem by the proper use of esoteric methodology.\n\nBlavatsky criticizes, Kalnitsky noted, the perspective of modern science, by disagreeing with the idea that the manipulation of matter presents a real scientific challenge. She asserts that replacing the word \"matter\" with the term \"spirit\" would result in a greater goal. She tries to show that knowledge of mere matter is not enough to provide the answers sought by science, because such knowledge does not adequately explain even the simplest phenomena of nature. Blavatsky notes that spiritualistic phenomena, with which she claims her audience would be well familiar, show the need for revising the prevailing scientific consensus. She argues that there is another form of \"proof\" of the existence of extrasensory abilities, citing the example of the use of narcotics, which allegedly had facilitated the demonstration of such abilities. Blavatsky's statement on \"natural phenomena\" is quoted in Kalnitsky thesis:\n\"No doubt the powers of human fancy are great; no doubt delusion and hallucination may be generated for a shorter or a longer period in the healthiest human brain either naturally or artificially. But natural phenomena that are not included in that 'abnormal' class do exist; and they have at last taken forcible possession even of scientific minds.\"\nRecognizing the potential errors inherent in relying upon imagination, and the unreliability of \"delusion and hallucination,\" Blavatsky is still trying to gain the \"stamp of legitimation\" from reputable scientific judgement that could confirm that supersensory abilities \"do exist.\" It was a constant aim of Theosophy, though implicit, and it was accompanied always by a distrust to the scientific approach. On the one hand, Blavatsky gives occasion for a reconciliation with the scientists, on the other—continues to denounce them. In Kalnitsky's opinion, she demonstrates a desire to show that the scientific evidence of the extrasensory perception is quite possible:\n\"The phenomena of hypnotism, of thought-transference, of sense-provoking, merging as they do into one another and manifesting their occult existence in our phenomenal world, succeeded finally in arresting the attention of some eminent scientists.\"\nKalnitsky stated Blavatsky shows a dualistic approach in her interpretation of these phenomena, distinguishing between \"their occult existence\" and their manifestation \"in our phenomenal world.\" Apparently, this means that there is noumenal \"sphere of reality,\" which is the basis of the phenomenal world. Furthermore, the assertion that \"some eminent scientists\" had shown interest in various forms of ESP, obviously, indicates that most scientists are not interested in it, and that widely recognizing of their paranormal nature did not happen. In particular, she criticizes the findings of the doctor Charcot and some other scientists in France, England, Russia, Germany and Italy, who \"have been investigating, experimenting and theorising for over fifteen years.\" This is quoted in work by Kalnitsky:\n\"The sole explanation given to the public, to those who thirst to become acquainted with the real, the intimate nature of the phenomena, with their productive cause and genesis—is that the sensitives who manifest them are all hysterical! They are psychopates, and neurosists—we are told—no other cause underlying the endless variety of manifestations than that of a purely physiological character.\"\n\nKalnitsky wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the scientists, who are trying to explore the controversial paranormal phenomena, find themselves in a situation of utter helplessness, but it is not their fault. They simply do not have an appropriate set of conceptual \"tools\" for the right approach to these phenomena. Without an elementary familiarization with occult principles and the adoption, at least as a working hypothesis, the notion of the subtle worlds of nature, the science is not able to reveal the true depth and scope of the universal laws that underlie all cosmic processes. The orthodox scientists-materialists are constrained by the limitations of their sciences, and so they need a new orientation based on the attraction of occult knowledge. However, according to Blavatsky, even admitting the legitimacy of the occult hypothesis, they will not be able to bring their research to the end:\n\"Therefore, having conducted their experiments to a certain boundary, they would desist and declare their task accomplished. Then the phenomena might be passed on to transcendentalists and philosophers to speculate upon.\"\nTurning to the consideration of conflicting opinions about the paranormal experience, Blavatsky says that the scientific recognition of the hypothesis about the nature of the psychic phenomena is not excluded, but it requires a discussion in relation to their underlying causes. She also claims that to defend the Theosophical position harder than spiritualistic, because the Theosophists categorically reject as a materialist theory so and a belief in spirits, presented in a traditional spiritualistic approach. Blavatsky classifies the spiritualists as the \"idealists\" and the scientists—as the \"materialists,\" who both fully convinced that modern science can, respectively, or to confirm, or to deny the authenticity of the kingdom of the spirits. But those who believe in the ability of a science to accept the occult presentation will be disappointed, because its modern methodology simply does not allow it. Kalnitsky has quoted:\n\"Science, unless remodelled entirely, can have no hand in occult teachings. Whenever investigated on the plan of the modern scientific methods, occult phenomena will prove ten times more difficult to explain than those of the spiritualists pure and simple.\"\nHe wrote that Blavatsky believes that modern scientific methods need to be rethought and remodeled to make it possible to study phenomena that can not be adequately explained from the materialistic standpoint. She expresses her disappointment with the existing state of affairs, doubting in achieving any progress. After ten years of a careful monitoring of the debate, she does not believe in the possibility of an objective and impartial investigation of the paranormal phenomena, not to mention the real revision of the well-established scientific views and the adoption of more adequate occult theory. The few scientists who could believe in the authenticity of such phenomena do not accept the hypothesis beyond the spiritualistic representations. Even in the midst of doubt of the truth of the materialist worldview, they are unable to move from spiritualism to the occult theory. In the study of unexplained side of the nature their respect for the traditional scientific orthodoxy always prevails over their personal views. Thus, according to Blavatsky, a necessary condition of objectivity is the impartiality and a change of the opinions.\n\nIn Kalnitsky's opinion, considering the methodology of science, Blavatsky understood that the inductive reasoning, based on data supplied by the physical senses, can not adequately provide a reliable way to study the abnormal phenomena. He has quoted:\n\"Science—I mean Western Science—has to proceed on strictly defined lines. She glories in her powers of observation, induction, analysis and inference. Whenever a phenomenon of an abnormal nature comes before her for investigation, she has to sift it to its very bottom, or let it go. And this she has to do, and she cannot, as we have shown, proceed on any other than the inductive methods based entirely on the evidence of physical senses.\"\n\nKalnitsky wrote Blavatsky argues that the fruits of materialistic scientific worldview, reaching the sphere of practical interests of the people, shape their ethics. She sees a direct logical connection between a faith in the soulless mechanistic universe and by the fact that is for her as a purely egoistic attitude to life. He has quoted:\n\"The theoretical materialistic science recognizes nought but substance. Substance is its deity, its only God.\" We are told that practical materialism, on the other hand, concerns itself with nothing that does not lead directly or indirectly to personal benefit. \"Gold is its idol,\" justly observes Professor Butleroff (a spiritualist, yet one who could never accept even the elementary truths of occultism, for he \"cannot understand them\"). – \"A lump of matter,\" he adds, \"the beloved substance of the theoretical materialists, is transformed into a lump of mud in the unclean hands of ethical materialism. And if the former gives but little importance to inner (psychic) states that are not perfectly demonstrated by their exterior states, the latter disregards entirely the inner states of life... The spiritual aspect of life has no meaning for practical materialism, everything being summed up for it in the external. The adoration of this external finds its principal and basic justification in the dogma of materialism, which has legalized it.\"\nKalnitsky wrote Blavatsky clearly expresses her utter contempt for the values of \"practical materialists.\" She accuses the ideological foundations of theoretical materialism for its an ignoring of the spiritual dimension of reality. This aversion to the complete unspirituality of the materialism reflects her \"implicit gnostic ethical stance.\" A materialistic-physical and selfish interests are not compatible with the idealised world of the spirit and the transcendental purpose of mystical enlightenment. The practical materialists, even professing adherence to a moral code, do not cease to be by ethical materialists. According to Kalnitsky, \"Blavatsky's radical gnostic dualism is allowing no room for compromise or alternative options.\" Thus, she considers the esoteric vision of reality the only viable alternative.\n\nKalnitsky wrote that science was seen in the West as the dominant category of knowledge and for the Theosophists it was not so an enemy, as a potential ally. However, the stereotypes of the materialistic thinking were one of the main obstacles to the esoteric representation of reality. Thus, at every opportunity Blavatsky tries to dispel what was for Theosophy, as she considered, alien and wrong. It is meant to challenge to many of the basic principles that supported the materialistic basis of science. However, a neutral and objective approach of the science to the analysis of the facts seemed, for the Theosophists, trustworthy. Blavatsky's striving to apply this approach to the consideration of the paranormal and mystical phenomena pursued a goal: to achieve the legitimacy and public acceptance of Theosophy. A skeptical position, which was taken by Blavatsky in respect of the materialistic science, was motivated by her outrage over the ignore by the scientists the spiritual dimension of reality. On the other hand, the assertion that spiritual truths can be proven from a scientific point of view, was a constant theme of Blavatsky's claims. The efforts of the Theosophists were focused on the legitimation of all forms of extrasensory and mystical experience.\n\nA few years after Blavatsky's death, the \"second generation\" of the Theosophists came to the leadership of the Theosophical Society. As Hammer wrote, during this period, the \"foci\" of the Theosophical scientism shifted from the theory of evolution to other areas of science. Charles Leadbeater, who became \"the chief ideologist\" of the Society, had involved with Annie Besant in the study of a functioning of the human mind. A religious studies scholar Gregory Tillett wrote that, according their claim, the functioning of mind \"extrudes into the external world\" the thought-forms which can be observed using clairvoyance methods. In 1901 Besant and Leadbeater published a book named \"Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation\" contained a lot of color illustrations of forms, \"created,\" according to its authors, by thoughts, emotions, and senses of men, as well by music. They argued that main source of the forms is the aura of man, the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his \"subtle bodies,\" interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body.\n\nAccording to Hammer and other scholars, in parallel with the \"psychophysiological\" researches, the Theosophists were busy an occult chemistry based on a \"greatly modified\" atomic theory. Leadbeater began \"the occult investigation\" of chemical elements as early as 1895, and Besant soon joined him. They argued that, using clairvoyance, can describe the intra-atomic structure of any element. In their words, each element composed of atoms containing a certain number of \"smaller particles.\" They published \"these and other results\" in 1908 in a book \"Occult Chemistry: Clairvoyant Observations on the Chemical Elements.\" Hammer wrote, \"Although Leadbeater was the principal clairvoyant, the enduring interest in... chemistry is probably due to Annie Besant's fascination with science, especially chemistry.\"\n\nA historian of religion Egil Asprem informed that in 1923, an astronomer and Theosophist G. E. Sutcliffe published a book \"Studies in Occult Chemistry and Physics\" which was a \"critical analysis\" of the theory of relativity. The author has pursued the goal: to equalize the meaning of \"Eastern\" and \"Western science,\" describing their \"as two complementary 'schools'.\" In this book, the theory of relativity is regarded as the highest achievement of \"Western science,\" whereas the results of the Theosophical study \"of atoms and etheric structures\" known as \"occult chemistry\" are presented as the achievement of \"the 'Eastern' school\". In an effort to show that the results of occult research can be compared with the theory of relativity, Sutcliffe \"proposes a wholly new theory of gravity,\" based on physics of ether. From his reasoning it can be seen that he is thoroughly erudite in the Theosophical literature, while also having a background in \"conventional physics from Britain\" in the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Sutcliffe tries to reinterpret the theory of Albert Einstein in \"a tradition of British anti-relativism\", operating with the liberal \"concept of ether.\" The concept of Sutcliffe is based on \"contraction and expansion of the accompanying ether of bodies,\" so, according to him, gravitation \"is one of the effects of an expanding sphere of ether,\" and the electrical phenomena are a function of the \"contracting sphere.\"\n\nProfessor Taimni wrote that the theory of relativity apparently gave \"a new direction to our civilization\" and created problems that \"are a challenge\" to our current worldview and ways of thinking. In the \"scientific circles\" it is considered that if mathematics is used to prove something, then the question \"is finally settled\", and it can't be discussed. However, most such conclusions are not always based on proven assumptions, and this makes possible a mistake in \"the final conclusion.\" Often one does not take into account the fact that mathematical inference can then be correct if he accepts into account \"all factors\" concerning this issue, and if it is not, the conclusion may be incorrect \"or only partially correct.\" This should be borne in mind when considering the nature of space and time, as well as the Einstein's method used to solve this problem. He based his theory \"only on facts of the physical world\" and if there are other, more subtle worlds \"besides the physical\", and they exist in accordance with the occult, then his theory has no authority \"with respect to those worlds.\" Since his theory is based only on physical facts, it can be true, at best, \"only for purely physical phenomena.\" It can't be assumed that it reveals the nature of space and time \"in general\", because it is presented \"to the human mind\" functioning within the boundaries of \"the physical brain.\" \"The very fact that the concept of the time-space continuum\" given in his theory is too difficult for the human mind, indicates its limitations. In fact, its author simply tried to interpret \"imperfectly the shadows of some realities cast on the screen in a shadow play of the mind.\"\n\nTaimni wrote that anyone who closely studied the nature of space and time could be convinced that the human mind is \"also a very important factor in this problem\", therefore, to understand the space and time, it is necessary to take into account this factor. And since the human mind is not only what is manifested through its physical brain, but has \"many degrees of subtlety and modes of expression,\" the entire human nature is \"really involved in the problem\" of space and time. And therefore only the one who \"dived\" into his consciousness and has \"unraveled\" his deepest secrets, having reached the source from which space and time come, is really capable of saying what the true nature \"of these basic realities of the universe is.\" \"Who is more competent to pronounce a correct opinion about the nature of an orange,\" Taimni is asking, \"he who has merely scratched the rind or he who has peeled the orange and eaten it?\"\n\nAccording to words of Kuhn, Blavatsky claimed, \"It is on the doctrine of the illusive nature of matter, and the infinite divisibility of the atom, that the whole science of Occultism is built.\" The researchers in esotericism Emily B. Sellon and Renée Weber have written: \n\"Anticipating the conclusions of Einsteinian relativity and field theory, as well as quantum mechanics, Blavatsky proposed a universe in which billiard-ball atoms and push-pull forces were replaced by space, time, motion, and energy, yielding a picture of a dynamic universe far in advance of her time.\"\n\nAccording to a philosopher and religious studies scholar Vladimir Trefilov, the modern Theosophists were among the first who attempted to create \"a new paradigm of thinking through the synthesis of scientific and non-scientific knowledge.\" As professor of Buddhist studies and Buddhist Evgeny Torchinov said, \"Discussion between physicists, philosophers, psychologists, and scholars of religious studies in order to find the solutions of a problem of the general scientific paradigm change, the isomorphism of consciousness and physical world, and even the ontology of consciousness in general could well take place, if don't resort to sticking labels like 'mysticism'.\" Professor Stanislav Grof, psychologist, wrote that Western science has raised matter to a status of the prime cause of Universe, reducing life, consciousness, and mind to the forms of its accidental products. Dominance in Western science a paradigm of Newton-Descartes became one of the causes of the emergence and development of the \"planetary crisis.\"\n\nAn Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova has believed that \"the post-materialist scientific paradigm and the worldview idealism\" should become a conceptual basis of the future civilization. The Russian cyberneticist Sergei Kurdyumov and philosopher Helena Knyazeva, in a book \"Laws of Evolution and Self-organization of Complex Systems,\" suggested that the \"paradigm of self-organization and non-linearity\" would become the basis of the new scientific paradigm, taking from the West \"the positive aspects of the tradition of analysis\", and from the East—ideas of the integrity, cyclicity, and the one law for Universe and man.\n\"Eastern ideas about the universal coherence, the unity of everything in the world, and the cyclic flowing into each other of Non-Being and Being (unmanifested and manifested) can resonate with the synergetic models... We can assume that there is a kind of an origin environment, in which all other observable and studied environments have grown. Then all the environments, with which we are dealing in life and scientific experiment, appear as some fluctuations (disturbances), the visible to us manifestations (modifications) of this one substrate—the origin environment.\" \nAccording to a historian of religion Egil Asprem, an Indian scientist and engineer Edi Bilimoria was one of the most significant characters \"in the Theosophical discourse on science of the last decade and a half.\" In his work \"Mirages in Western Science Resolved by Occult Science\" he confirms the division into \"Western\" and \"occult\" science which took place already at the time of the formation of the Theosophical Society, and also \"conceptually\" updates the discussion of \"modern physics and cosmology.\" Playing back the well-known Theosophical \"rhetoric,\" Bilimoria suggests to move forward to \"a reconciliation and reuniting of the wise old parent, Occult Science, with its adolescent prodigal son, Western science.\"\n\"Occult science is not bent on toppling, but rather on uplifting Western science to an even nobler position, by using examples from Western science itself to show how it is rooted in the deeper substratum of Occult Science and Philosophy.\"\n\nA Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovyov wrote that modern Theosophy is a doctrine not only \"anti-religious\" and \"antiphilosophic\", but also \"anti-scientific.\" A religious philosopher Sergius Bulgakov stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a \"vulgar pseudoscientific mythology.\" In Berdyaev's opinion, modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a \"mixture\" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.\n\nThe ambiguous attitude of the Theosophists towards science was especially abruptly criticized by the servants of the Christian church. In 1912, John Driscoll, an author of \"The Catholic Encyclopedia,\" has described Theosophy's attitude to science as follows:\n\"Modern theosophy claims to be a definite science. Its teachings are the product of thought, and its source is consciousness, not any Divine revelation. <...> Judging it as presented by its own exponents, it appears to be a strange mixture of mysticism, charlatanism, and thaumaturgic pretension combined with an eager effort to express its teaching in words which reflect the atmosphere of Christian ethics and modern scientific truths.\"\n\nA Russian theologian, Andrey Kuraev, accused the Theosophists of violation of the principles of scientific aethics, arguing they do not react to the opponents' objections, do not bring \"a scientific arguments in support of their position\", and also put themselves \"beyond all criticism from side of science.\" In support of his words, Kurayev quoted Blavatsky's statement on the need to fight with \"every modern scholar's\" pretension to evaluate \"of ancient Esotericism\", when he is not \"a Mystic\" or \"a Kabalist\". In connection with the special attention of the Theosophists to the theory of evolution, a Russian Orthodox cleric and theologian Dimitry Drujinin wrote that \"Theosophy began to parasitize on the central tendencies of thought and science of its time.\" And also: \"The rough and cheeky Blavatsky's criticism of Darwinism turned into personal insults to scholars.\" According to Drujinin, \"the statements of Theosophy are an absurd nonsense.\" Lydia Fesenkova, an employee of the Institute of philosophy, also severely criticized the occult statements of Blavatsky, which described anthropogenesis: \"From the point of view of science, such beliefs are an explicit profanity and don't have the right to exist in the serious literature.\"\n\nAn answering the question about pseudoscience said, \"The dominant value of the scientific rationality begins to influence other spheres of culture—and religion, the myth are modernized often under this influence. On the border between them and science arise the parascientific concepts, which are trying to find a place in the field of science.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1956, when the Hungarian Revolution broke out, she left Hungary as a political refugee. She finished high school in Innsbruck, graduated from a bilingual gymnasium, and won a scholarship to the University of Vienna where she studied languages.\n\nBudapest immigrated to the United States in 1959, where she studied at the University of Chicago, with groundbreaking originator of the art of improvisation, Viola Spolin, and the improvisational theater group The Second City. She married and had two sons, Laszlo and Gabor, but later divorced. She realized she is a lesbian and chose, in her words, to avoid the \"duality\" between man and woman.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles from New York City in 1970, and became an activist in the women's liberation movement. She was on the staff of the first Women's Center in the U.S. there for many years, and became the Founder and High Priestess of Susan B. Anthony Coven #1, the first feminist, women-only, witches' coven, which was founded in 1971. She was responsible for the creation of an Anti-Rape Squad and the Take Back the Night Movement in Southern California, and facilitated many of their street marches.\n\nIn 1975, she was arrested for \"fortune telling\" at her candle and book store in Venice, California following a \"sting\" by an undercover police woman Rosalie Kimberlin, who received a tarot reading from her. Subsequently, Budapest was charged with violating a municipal by-law, Code 43.30, which meant fortune telling was unlawful. Budapest and her defense team described the event as \"the first witch prosecuted since Salem,\" and the ensuing trial became a focus for media and pagan protesters. Budapest was found guilty.\n\nDuly, Budapest and her legal counsel set out to establish Wicca, and more specifically Dianic Wicca, as a bona fide religion. The state's Supreme Court reversed the guilty verdict as unconstitutional and in violation of the Freedom of Religion Act.\n\nFollowing her conviction, she engaged in nine years of appeals on the grounds that reading the Tarot was an example of women spiritually counseling women within the context of their religion. With pro bono legal representation she was acquitted, and the laws against \"fortune telling\" were struck from California law.\n\nIn 2012, Budapest requested via Facebook that the song she wrote, \"We All Come From The Goddess\" be performed as written and not be altered to include male gods. She initially stated that anyone changing her song was cursed, but clarified in comments section of this post that she was joking.\n\nBudapest claims that her first job in television was as a Color Girl for the CBS Network in New York; that she was assigned to \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", and that it was her face that CBS adjusted their camera's settings to. In the eighties, she created the TV show \"13th Heaven\", which ran on syndicated cable in the San Francisco Bay area for seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
