{"id": "1630583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1630583", "title": "Arica School", "text": "Arica School\n\nThe Arica School, also known as the Arica Institute (which is its incorporated educational organization) or simply as Arica, is a human potential movement group founded in 1968 by Bolivian-born philosopher Oscar Ichazo (born 1931). The school is named after the city of Arica, Chile, where Ichazo once lived and where he led an intensive months-long training in 1970 and 1971 before settling in the United States where the Arica Institute (incorporated in 1971) has since been headquartered.\n\nThe Arica School can be considered, as \"Ramparts\" magazine put it in 1973, \"A body of techniques for cosmic consciousness-raising and an ideology to relate to the world in an awakened way.\"\n\nThe Arica School's origins began in 1956 when groups of people formed in major cities in South America to study the theory and method that Ichazo was proposing. For fourteen years these different groups studied his teachings. In 1968 Ichazo presented lectures on his theories of Protoanalysis and the ego-fixations at the Institute of Applied Psychology in Santiago, Chile.\n\nIchazo's theories are based upon such traditional metaphysical questions such as: \"What is humankind?\"; \"What is the supreme good of humanity?\"; and \"What is the truth that gives meaning and value to human life?\"\n\nThe entire theory is referred to as based on the idea of the Innate Structure of Mind. That is, the questions come from the Instincts and the Instincts are a result of a pre-existing structure that is the foundation of Mind itself. It is a concept considered logical because there must be a pre-existing order if all minds share essential similarities. \n\nIchazo refined the ancient concept that a human soul has components by approaching the issue through three instinctual questions that he considered basic to human existence: \"How am I?\", \"Who am I with?\", \"What am I doing?\" Ichazo labeled these conservation, relations, and syntony (later modified to adaptation). Recognizing interactions among the three, he developed a 3 x 3 = 9 component system, which he correlated with several schemas that have long existed in diverse fields: spectrum of light, chakras, physiological systems, the enneagram, etc.\n\nFor example, each component of the psyche was assigned a corresponding color, which was reinforced through a wide variety of self-development exercises. The Hypergnostic meditation utilized the ancient notion of vertically arranged chakras, expanding the seven chakra system widely used in Hindu meditation into nine by adding the sacrum and the nape of the neck. Modern biology was incorporated into the theory by associating the hypergnostic rings (chakras) with anatomy rather than energy centers.\n\nFor self-observation of habitual patterns, Ichazo employed the enneagram, among other tools. Transformative practices sometimes involved linking a specific mudra and / or bija with each of the nine points of the enneagram. During the first three decades or so, most aspects of his theory that were mapped onto the enneagram were circular mappings (e.g., closing of the spectrum into a circular Rainbow Eye) that involved little or no utilization of the interconnecting lines that constitute the enneagram's form. In other words, most of the maps were enneagons rather than enneagrams (refer to enneagram figure for drawings that show the difference).\n\nLike some other systems of self-actualization, Arica works with the (ultimately illusory) separation of essence and ego. An important aspect of this work is to observe one's habits and reactions in accordance with a typology of nine. However, Ichazo referred to the characterizations as \"fixations\" rather than \"personality types\" and he repeatedly emphasized that every human being contains all nine types (\"we have to awaken all the nine positions\"). The fixation was simply a key to self-discovery, not a form of identity like one's sun sign in astrology.\n\nThe inherent difficulty of working with the ego and essence distinction while maintaining an ultimate philosophical stance of nondualism can be appreciated by mystics of any path. Such \"inner work\" entails the risk of inflating one's ego with notions such as \"I am a special person because I have higher knowledge\" or \"I am aware of my ego, but you are not aware of yours\". To avoid problems that could arise from this delicate type of work, Ichazo emphasized group exercises and honest interpersonal encounters (\"ego reduction\"). He also insisted on secrecy, specifically not propagating the theory without his permission. With this essential context in mind a person is prepared to understand Ichazo's position in the enneagram controversy.\n\nIchazo is considered by many to be the father of the Enneagram of Personality (usually just called the Enneagram) movement which uses an enneagram figure. The United States Court of Appeals ruled that Ichazo is the original author of the application of the enneagram figure to a theory of ego fixations (which are the precursor to personality disorders). However, this ruling denied copyright injunction under the \"fair use\" doctrine of copyright law. Because the enneagram symbol is a discovery (not an invention), the legal issue was not use of the symbol but rather the copyrightability of specific \"enneagrams\", meaning symbol plus descriptive words (or other information) associated with each point. Ichazo had earlier described the enneagrams as a set of immutable laws but he had also said that he \"developed\" the enneagrams.\n\nIchazo has applied the enneagram figure in connection with his theory of mechanical ego mechanisms which grow out of psychological traumas suffered at an early age in specific aspects of the human psyche. In his basic theory, these aspects of the human psyche include the sense of well-being (conservation instinct); the sense of relations with others (relation instinct); and the sense of adapting to our environment (adaptation instinct). Ichazo's goal with regard to the study of the enneagram is to facilitate the recognition of repetitive, mechanistic thinking and behavior in a person's psychological process and to eliminate the suffering rooted in the attachment to, and identification with, these mechanisms (which, Ichazo teaches, attempt to protect us from suffering but actually tend to perpetuate it).\n\nThe popular use of the Enneagram of Personality (as contrasted with the use of enneagrams within the Arica School) began principally with Claudio Naranjo who had studied with Ichazo in Chile. Ichazo considers Naranjo's understanding of the Enneagram to be limited and incomplete. Naranjo's major contribution to the Enneagram of Personality was his addition of defense mechanisms to the model developed by Ichazo: \"His contribution to the Enneagram successfully joined the insight and methods of a mystical path of transformation with the intellectual power of a Western psychological model.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that Ichazo \"either came under the influence of the school that taught G.I. Gurdjieff or, at least, studied under students of Gurdjieff.\" Ichazo, however, has denied any connection between his and Gurdjieff's teachings. Some writers in the Enneagram of Personality field have claimed that the enneagram figure is a Sufi symbol. Although the symbolism of the number 9 is ancient, there does not appear to be any evidence for the enneagram figure before Gurdjieff in Sufism or elsewhere.\n\nAs presented in later years (post-2000), a large part of Arica is the study of classical philosophy as compared to \"modern\" philosophy. This is a departure from the early 1990s when Ichazo was intent on correlating Arica with Tantric Buddhism. In recent years, Ichazo has pointedly asserted that his understanding of the Enneagram originated with reading classical philosophy and Plotinus' Enneads and not as any consequence of any writing or work of Gurdjieff. In \"Interviews With Oscar Ichazo\" he states that he encountered the enneagram figure before he encountered the works of Gurdjieff, implying that it was before he joined (circa 1950) a group of mystics in Buenos Aires that included some people who had participated in the Fourth Way work presented by Gurdjieff.\n\nThe tools that the Arica School teaches are called the “Protoanalytical Theory, System and Method” or \"Protoanalysis\". Before 1980, the term \"protoanalysis\" was misunderstood to be narrower in scope, used specifically as the name for Ichazo's theory of types, from which the Enneagram of Personality was derived.\n\nProtoanalysis is proposed by Ichazo to be a comprehensive analysis of the complete human being, from the grossest aspects of the human process (e.g., enneagramatic and mentational analyses of human anatomy and physiology), progressing systematically to the higher states of consciousness where enlightenment can be attained (e.g., the direct and ceaseless experience of non-dual union with the Divine).\n\nThe Arica School presents a detailed map of the human psyche that aims to serve as a guide for discovering the basis of one's ego process, enabling individuals to transcend that process into a higher state of consciousness that is found in and available to every person. This state of being is seen as the recognition of one's true essential self, experienced as an internal state of great happiness, light, and liberation.\n\n\n"}

It was first discussed by Jan Narveson in 1967, and Jeff McMahan coined the term 'the Asymmetry' 1981. McMahan formulates the Asymmetry as follows: “while the fact that a person's life would be worse than no life at all ... constitutes a strong moral reason for not bringing him into existence, the fact that a person's life would be worth living provides no (or only a relatively weak) moral reason for bringing him into existence.” Professor Nils Holtug formulates the Asymmetry evaluatively in terms of the value of outcomes instead of in terms of moral reasons. Holtug's formulation says that “while it detracts from the value of an outcome to add individuals whose lives are of overall negative value, it does not increase the value of an outcome to add individuals whose lives are of overall positive value.”\n\nMuch of the literature on the ethics of procreation deals with the Asymmetry. A number of authors have defended the Asymmetry, and a number of authors have argued against it.\n\n"}

{"id": "302185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302185", "title": "Bernard Bolzano", "text": "Bernard Bolzano\n\nBernard Bolzano (, , , ; born Bernardus Placidus Johann Gonzal Nepomuk Bolzano; 5 October 1781 – 18 December 1848) was a Bohemian mathematician, logician, philosopher, theologian and Catholic priest of Italian extraction, also known for his antimilitarist views.\n\nBolzano wrote in German, his native language. For the most part, his work came to prominence posthumously.\n\nBolzano was the son of two pious Catholics. His father, Bernard Pompeius Bolzano, was an Italian who had moved to Prague, where he married Maria Cecilia Maurer who came from Prague's German-speaking family Maurer. Only two of their twelve children lived to adulthood.\n\nBolzano entered the University of Prague in 1796 and studied mathematics, philosophy and physics. Starting in 1800, he also began studying theology, becoming a Catholic priest in 1804. He was appointed to the new chair of philosophy of religion at Prague University in 1805. He proved to be a popular lecturer not only in religion but also in philosophy, and he was elected Dean of the Philosophical Faculty in 1818.\n\nBolzano alienated many faculty and church leaders with his teachings of the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social and economic systems that would direct the nation's interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations. Upon his refusal to recant his beliefs, Bolzano was dismissed from the university in 1819.\n\nHis political convictions, which he was inclined to share with others with some frequency, eventually proved to be too liberal for the Austrian authorities. He was exiled to the countryside and then devoted his energies to his writings on social, religious, philosophical, and mathematical matters.\n\nAlthough forbidden to publish in mainstream journals as a condition of his exile, Bolzano continued to develop his ideas and publish them either on his own or in obscure Eastern European journals. In 1842 he moved back to Prague, where he died in 1848.\n\nBolzano made several original contributions to mathematics. His overall philosophical stance was that, contrary to much of the prevailing mathematics of the era, it was better not to introduce intuitive ideas such as time and motion into mathematics . To this end, he was one of the earliest mathematicians to begin instilling rigor into mathematical analysis with his three chief mathematical works \"Beyträge zu einer begründeteren Darstellung der Mathematik\" (1810), \"Der binomische Lehrsatz\" (1816) and \"Rein analytischer Beweis\" (1817). These works presented \"...a sample of a new way of developing analysis\", whose ultimate goal would not be realized until some fifty years later when they came to the attention of Karl Weierstrass .\n\nTo the foundations of mathematical analysis he contributed the introduction of a fully rigorous ε–δ definition of a mathematical limit. Bolzano was the first to recognize the greatest lower bound property of the real numbers. Like several others of his day, he was skeptical of the possibility of Gottfried Leibniz's infinitesimals, that had been the earliest putative foundation for differential calculus. Bolzano's notion of a limit was similar to the modern one: that a limit, rather than being a relation among infinitesimals, must instead be cast in terms of how the dependent variable approaches a definite quantity as the independent variable approaches some other definite quantity.\n\nBolzano also gave the first purely analytic proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, which had originally been proven by Gauss from geometrical considerations. He also gave the first purely analytic proof of the intermediate value theorem (also known as Bolzano's theorem). Today he is mostly remembered for the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, which Karl Weierstrass developed independently and published years after Bolzano's first proof and which was initially called the Weierstrass theorem until Bolzano's earlier work was rediscovered .\n\nBolzano's posthumously published work \"Paradoxien des Unendlichen (The Paradoxes of the Infinite)\" (1851) was greatly admired by many of the eminent logicians who came after him, including Charles Sanders Peirce, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind. Bolzano's main claim to fame, however, is his 1837 \"Wissenschaftslehre\" (\"Theory of Science\"), a work in four volumes that covered not only philosophy of science in the modern sense but also logic, epistemology and scientific pedagogy. The logical theory that Bolzano developed in this work has come to be acknowledged as ground-breaking. Other works are a four-volume \"Lehrbuch der Religionswissenschaft\" (\"Textbook of the Science of Religion\") and the metaphysical work \"Athanasia\", a defense of the immortality of the soul. Bolzano also did valuable work in mathematics, which remained virtually unknown until Otto Stolz rediscovered many of his lost journal articles and republished them in 1881.\n\nIn his 1837 \"Wissenschaftslehre\" Bolzano attempted to provide logical foundations for all sciences, building on abstractions like part-relation, abstract objects, attributes, sentence-shapes, ideas and propositions in themselves, sums and sets, collections, substances, adherences, subjective ideas, judgments, and sentence-occurrences. These attempts were basically an extension of his earlier thoughts in the philosophy of mathematics, for example his 1810 \"Beiträge\" where he emphasized the distinction between the objective relationship between logical consequences and our subjective recognition of these connections. For Bolzano, it was not enough that we merely have \"confirmation\" of natural or mathematical truths, but rather it was the proper role of the sciences (both pure and applied) to seek out \"justification\" in terms of the fundamental truths that may or may not appear to be obvious to our intuitions.\n\nBolzano begins his work by explaining what he means by \"theory of science\", and the relation between our knowledge, truths and sciences. Human knowledge, he states, is made of all truths (or true propositions) that men know or have known. This is, however, only a very small fraction of all the truths that exist, although still too much for one human being to comprehend. Therefore, our knowledge is divided into more accessible parts. Such a collection of truths is what Bolzano calls a science (\"Wissenschaft\"). It is important to note that not all true propositions of a science have to be known to men; hence, this is how we can make discoveries in a science.\n\nTo better understand and comprehend the truths of a science, men have created textbooks (\"Lehrbuch\"), which of course contain only the true propositions of the science known to men. But how to know where to divide our knowledge, that is, which truths belong together? Bolzano explains that we will ultimately know this through some reflection, but that the resulting rules of how to divide our knowledge into sciences will be a science in itself. This science, that tells us which truths belong together and should be explained in a textbook, is the \"Theory of Science\" (\"Wissenschaftslehre\").\n\nIn the \"Wissenschaftslehre\", Bolzano is mainly concerned with three realms:\n\n(1) The realm of language, consisting in words and sentences. <br>\n(2) The realm of thought, consisting in subjective ideas and judgements. <br>\n(3) The realm of logic, consisting in objective ideas (or ideas in themselves) and propositions in themselves.\n\nBolzano devotes a great part of the \"Wissenschaftslehre\" to an explanation of these realms and their relations.\n\nTwo distinctions play a prominent role in his system. Firstly, the distinction between parts and wholes. For instance, words are parts of sentences, subjective ideas are parts of judgments, objective ideas are parts of propositions in themselves. Secondly, all objects divide into those that exist, which means that they are causally connected and located in time and/or space, and those that do not exist. Bolzano's original claim is that the logical realm is populated by objects of the latter kind.\n\n\"Satz an Sich\" is a basic notion in Bolzano's \"Wissenschaftslehre\". It is introduced at the very beginning, in section 19. Bolzano first introduces the notions of proposition (spoken or written or thought or in itself) and idea (spoken or written or thought or in itself). \"The grass is green\" is a proposition (\"Satz\"): in this connection of words, something is said or asserted. \"Grass\", however, is only an idea (\"Vorstellung\"). Something is represented by it, but it does not assert anything. Bolzano's notion of proposition is fairly broad: \"A rectangle is round\" is a proposition — even though it is false by virtue of self-contradiction — because it is composed in an intelligible manner out of intelligible parts.\n\nBolzano does not give a complete definition of a \"Satz an Sich\" (i.e. proposition in itself) but he gives us just enough information to understand what he means by it. A proposition in itself (i) has no existence (that is: it has no position in time or place), (ii) is either true or false, independent of anyone knowing or thinking that it is true or false, and (iii) is what is 'grasped' by thinking beings. So a written sentence ('Socrates has wisdom') grasps a proposition in itself, namely the proposition [Socrates has wisdom]. The written sentence does have existence (it has a certain location at a certain time, say it is on your computer screen at this very moment) and expresses the proposition in itself which is in the realm of in itself (i.e. \"an sich\"). (Bolzano's use of the term \"an sich\" differs greatly from that of Kant; for Kant's use of the term see \"an sich\".)\n\nEvery proposition in itself is composed out of ideas in themselves (for simplicity, we will use \"proposition\" to mean \"proposition in itself\" and \"idea\" to refer to an objective idea or idea in itself. Ideas are negatively defined as those parts of a proposition that are themselves not propositions. A proposition consists of at least three ideas, namely: a subject idea, a predicate idea and the copula (i.e. 'has', or another form of \"to have\"). (Though there are propositions which contain propositions, but we won't take them into consideration right now.)\n\nBolzano identifies certain types of ideas. There are simple ideas that have no parts (as an example Bolzano uses [something]), but there are also complex ideas that consist of other ideas (Bolzano uses the example of [nothing], which consists of the ideas [not] and [something]). Complex ideas can have the same content (i.e. the same parts) without being the same — because their components are differently connected. The idea [A black pen with blue ink] is different from the idea [A blue pen with black ink] though the parts of both ideas are the same.\n\nIt is important to understand that an idea does not need to have an object. Bolzano uses \"object\" to denote something that is represented by an idea. An idea that has an object, represents that object. But an idea that does not have an object represents nothing. (Don't get confused here by terminology: an objectless idea is an idea without a representation.)\n\nLet's consider, for further explanation, an example used by Bolzano. The idea [a round square], does not have an object, because the object that ought to be represented is self-contrary. A different example is the idea [nothing] which certainly does not have an object. However, the proposition [the idea of a round square has complexity] has as its subject-idea [the idea of a round square]. This subject-idea does have an object, namely the idea [a round square]. But, that idea does not have an object.\n\nBesides objectless ideas, there are ideas that have only one object, e.g. the idea [the first man on the moon] represents only one object. Bolzano calls these ideas 'singular ideas'. Obviously there are also ideas that have many objects (e.g. [the citizens of Amsterdam]) and even infinitely many objects (e.g. [a prime number]).\n\nBolzano has a complex theory of how we are able to sense things. He explains sensation by means of the term intuition, in German called \"Anschauung\". An intuition is a simple idea, it has only one object (\"Einzelvorstellung\"), but besides that, it is also unique (Bolzano needs this to explain sensation). Intuitions (\"Anschauungen\") are objective ideas, they belong to the \"an sich\" realm, which means that they don’t have existence. As said, Bolzano’s argumentation for intuitions is by an explanation of sensation.\n\nWhat happens when you sense a real existing object, for instance a rose, is this: the different aspects of the rose, like its scent and its color, cause in you a change. That change means that before and after sensing the rose, your mind is in a different state. So sensation is in fact a change in your mental state. How is this related to objects and ideas? Bolzano explains that this change, in your mind, is essentially a simple idea (\"Vorstellung\"), like, ‘this smell’ (of this particular rose). This idea represents; it has as its object the change. Besides being simple, this change must also be unique. This is because literally you can’t have the same experience twice, nor can two people, who smell the same rose at the same time, have exactly the same experience of that smell (although they will be quite alike). So each single sensation causes a single (new) unique and simple idea with a particular change as its object. Now, this idea in your mind is a subjective idea, meaning that it is in you at a particular time. It has existence. But this subjective idea must correspond to, or has as a content, an objective idea. This is where Bolzano brings in intuitions (\"Anschauungen\"); they are the simple, unique and objective ideas that correspond to our subjective ideas of changes caused by sensation. So for each single possible sensation, there is a corresponding objective idea. Schematically the whole process is like this: whenever you smell a rose, its scent causes a change in you. This change is the object of your subjective idea of that particular smell. That subjective idea corresponds to the intuition or \"Anschauung\".\n\nAccording to Bolzano, all propositions are composed out of three (simple or complex) elements: a subject, a predicate and a copula. Instead of the more traditional copulative term 'is', Bolzano prefers 'has'. The reason for this is that 'has', unlike 'is', can connect a concrete term, such as 'Socrates', to an abstract term such as 'baldness'. \"Socrates has baldness\" is, according to Bolzano, preferable to \"Socrates is bald\" because the latter form is less basic: 'bald' is itself composed of the elements 'something', 'that', 'has' and 'baldness'. Bolzano also reduces existential propositions to this form: \"Socrates exists\" would simply become \"Socrates has existence (\"Dasein\")\".\n\nA major role in Bolzano’s logical theory is played by the notion of \"variations\": various logical relations are defined in terms of the changes in truth value that propositions incur when their non-logical parts are replaced by others. Logically analytical propositions, for instance, are those in which all the non-logical parts can be replaced without change of truth value. Two propositions are 'compatible' (\"verträglich\") with respect to one of their component parts x if there is at least one term that can be inserted that would make both true. A proposition Q is 'deducible' (\"ableitbar\") from a proposition P, with respect to certain of their non-logical parts, if any replacement of those parts that makes P true also makes Q true. If a proposition is deducible from another with respect to all its non-logical parts, it is said to be 'logically deducible'.\nBesides the relation of deducibility, Bolzano also has a stricter relation of 'consequentiality' (\"Abfolge\"). This is an asymmetric relation that obtains between true propositions, when one of the propositions is not only deducible from, but also explained by the other.\n\nBolzano distinguishes five meanings the words \"true\" and \"truth\" have in common usage, all of which Bolzano takes to be unproblematic. The meanings are listed in order of properness:\n\nI. Abstract objective meaning: \"Truth\" signifies an attribute that may apply to a proposition, primarily to a proposition in itself, namely the attribute on the basis of which the proposition expresses something that in reality is as is expressed. Antonyms: \"falsity, falseness, falsehood\".\n\nII. Concrete objective meaning: (a) \"Truth\" signifies a proposition that has the attribute \"truth\" in the abstract objective meaning. Antonym: (a) \"falsehood\".\n\nIII. Subjective meaning: (a) \"Truth\" signifies a correct judgment. Antonym: (a) \"mistake\".\n\nIV. Collective meaning: \"Truth\" signifies a body or multiplicity true propositions or judgments (e.g. the biblical truth).\n\nV. Improper meaning: \"True\" signifies that some object is in reality what some denomination states it to be. (e.g. the true God). Antonyms: \"false, unreal, illusory\".\n\nBolzano's primary concern is with the concrete objective meaning: with concrete objective truths or truths in themselves. All truths in themselves are a kind of propositions in themselves. They do not exist, i.e. they are not spatiotemporally located as thought and spoken propositions are. However, certain propositions have the attribute of being a truth in itself. Being a thought proposition is not a part of the concept of a truth in itself, notwithstanding the fact that, given God’s omniscience, all truths in themselves are also thought truths. The concepts ‘truth in itself’ and ‘thought truth’ are interchangeable, as they apply to the same objects, but they are not identical.\n\nBolzano offers as the correct definition of (abstract objective) truth: a proposition is true if it expresses something that applies to its object. The correct definition of a (concrete objective) truth must thus be: a truth is a proposition that expresses something that applies to its object. This definition applies to truths in themselves, rather than to thought or known truths, as none of the concepts figuring in this definition are subordinate to a concept of something mental or known.\n\nBolzano proves in §§31–32 of his \"Wissenschaftslehre\" three things:\n\nA There is at least one truth in itself (concrete objective meaning):\nB. There is more than one truth in itself:\nC. There are infinitely many truths in themselves:\n\nA known truth has as its parts (\"Bestandteile\") a truth in itself and a judgment (Bolzano, \"Wissenschaftslehre\" §26). A judgment is a thought which states a true proposition. In judging (at least when the matter of the judgment is a true proposition), the idea of an object is being connected in a certain way with the idea of a characteristic (§ 23). In true judgments, the relation between the idea of the object and the idea of the characteristic is an actual/existent relation (§28).\n\nEvery judgment has as its matter a proposition, which is either true or false. Every judgment exists, but not \"für sich\". Judgments, namely, in contrast with propositions in themselves, are dependent on subjective mental activity. Not every mental activity, though, has to be a judgment; recall that all judgments have as matter propositions, and hence all judgments need to be either true or false. Mere presentations or thoughts are examples of mental activities which do not necessarily need to be stated (behaupten), and so are not judgments (§ 34).\n\nJudgments that have as its matter true propositions can be called cognitions (§36). Cognitions are also dependent on the subject, and so, opposed to truths in themselves, cognitions do permit degrees; a proposition can be more or less known, but it cannot be more or less true. Every cognition implies necessarily a judgment, but not every judgment is necessarily cognition, because there are also judgments that are not true. Bolzano maintains that there are no such things as false cognitions, only false judgments (§34).\n\nBolzano came to be surrounded by a circle of friends and pupils who spread his thoughts about (the so-called Bolzano Circle), but the effect of his thought on philosophy initially seemed destined to be slight.\n\nHis work was rediscovered, however, by Edmund Husserl and Kazimierz Twardowski, both students of Franz Brentano. Through them, Bolzano became a formative influence on both phenomenology and analytic philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The subject of the belief may even be correct, but a credulous person will believe it without good evidence.\n\nThe words \"gullible\" and \"credulous\" are commonly used as synonyms. state that while both words mean \"unduly trusting or confiding\", gullibility stresses being duped or made a fool of, suggesting a lack of intelligence, whereas credulity stresses uncritically forming beliefs, suggesting a lack of skepticism. states the difference is a matter of degree: the gullible are \"the easiest to deceive\", while the credulous are \"a little too quick to believe something, but they usually aren't stupid enough to act on it.\"\n\nMany societies mark April Fools' Day or All Fools' Day on April 1 each year. The day features the commission of hoaxes and other practical jokes of varying sophistication on friends, family members, enemies, and neighbors, or sending them on a fool's errand, the aim of which is to embarrass the gullible.\n\nCold reading, a magic trick that gives the appearance of a psychic experience, relies on the credulous belief of an audience that something psychic is occurring. Hence the audience fits the utterances of the cold reader to be consistent with psychic abilities, while ignoring any contrary evidence.\n\nA confidence trick or confidence game is an attempt to defraud a person or group by gaining their confidence. Confidence men exploit human characteristics such as greed and dishonesty, and have victimized individuals from all walks of life.\n\nPolitics and practical jokes are also related to credulity.\n\nPseudoscience, a methodology, belief, or practice that is claimed to be scientific, or that is made to appear to be scientific, but which does not adhere to an appropriate scientific methodology,\nlacks supporting evidence or plausibility,\nor otherwise lacks scientific status.\nProfessor Paul DeHart Hurd\nargued that a large part of gaining scientific literacy is \"being able to distinguish science from pseudo-science such as astrology, quackery, the occult, and superstition\".\n\nA religion is a system of human thought which usually includes a set of narratives, symbols, beliefs and practices that give meaning to the practitioner's experiences of life through reference to a higher power, God or gods, or ultimate truth.\nAtheist‘s and members of other religions may regard many other religious faiths as credulous cults. \n\nA snipe hunt, a form of wild-goose chase that is also known as a fool's errand, is a type of practical joke that involves experienced people making fun of credulous newcomers by giving them an impossible or imaginary task. The origin of the term is a practical joke where inexperienced campers are told about a bird or animal called the snipe as well as a usually preposterous method of catching it, such as running around the woods carrying a bag or making strange noises.\n\nSuperstition is a credulous belief or notion, not based on reason or knowledge. The word \"superstition\" is often used pejoratively to refer to folk beliefs deemed irrational. This leads to some superstitions being called \"old wives' tales.\" It is also commonly applied to beliefs and practices surrounding luck, prophecy and spiritual beings, particularly the irrational belief that future events can be influenced or foretold by specific unrelated prior events.\n\nTreacle mining is the fictitious mining of treacle, similar to molasses in a raw form similar to coal. The subject purports to be a serious topic, but is in fact an attempt to test the credulity of the reader. The thick black nature of treacle makes the deception plausible. The topic has been a standing joke in British humor for a century or more.\n\nIn literature, Lewis Carroll provides a discussion of credulity:\nAlice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said, 'one \"can't\" believe impossible things.'<br>\n'I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. [...]'\n"}
{"id": "16136723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16136723", "title": "Discursive dilemma", "text": "Discursive dilemma\n\nDiscursive dilemma or doctrinal paradox is a paradox in social choice theory. The paradox is that aggregating judgments with majority voting can result in self-contradictory judgments.\n\nConsider a community voting on a road repairs. The same group may return a \"Yes\" if asked three questions, but a \"No\" if asked one question. This paradox emerges because the community may vote 'Yes' - the roads are important, and 'Yes' - the weather is right for road repair, and 'Yes' - there are available funds for the repairs. However, due to complexity of individual opinion and disagreement, the majority may at the same time rule that \"No, all three requirements for road repair are not present\". Thus the road repair team gets different feedback depending on how they poll their community.\n\nPhilosopher Philip Pettit believes the discursive dilemma makes it impossible to make simple statements about the beliefs of a collective.\n\nPrinceton philosopher Philip Pettit says there are hidden challenges of describing the group as though it were a single individual - a metaphorical agent - the way the law sometimes talks about corporations. It is a mistake, he says, to think things can be that simple.\n\nIn reality, it can be quite difficult to construct a model of the \"group mind\" by merely asking for a majority opinion. This is because contradictory conceptions of a group can emerge depending on the type of questioning that is chosen.\n\nTo see how, imagine that a three-member court must decide whether someone is liable for a breach of contract. For example, a lawn caretaker is accused of violating a contract not to mow over the land-owner's roses. The judges have to decide which of the following propositions are true:\nAdditionally, all judges accept the proposition formula_1. In other words, the judges agree that a defendant should be liable if and only if the two propositions, P and Q, are both true.\n\nEach judge could make consistent (non-contradictory) judgments, and the paradox will still emerge. Most judges could think P is true, and most judges could think Q is true. In this example, that means they would vote that the caretaker probably mowed over the roses, and that the contract did indeed forbid that action. This suggests the caretaker is \"liable\". \n\nAt the same time, most judges may think that P and Q are not both true at once. In this example, that means most judges conclude the caretaker is \"not liable\". The table above illustrates how majority decisions can contradict (because the judges vote in favor of the premises, and yet reject the conclusion). The paradox lies in choosing between two group liability opinions.\n\nThis dilemma results because an actual decision-making procedure might be premise-based or conclusion-based. In a premise-based procedure, the judges decide by voting whether the conditions for liability are met. In a conclusion-based procedure, the judges decide directly whether the defendant should be liable. In the above formulation, the paradox is that the two procedures don't necessarily lead to the same result; the two procedures can even lead to opposite results.\n\nPettit believes that the lesson of this paradox is that there is no simple way to aggregate individual opinions into a single, coherent \"group entity\". These ideas are relevant to sociology, which endeavors to understand and predict group behaviour. Petitt warns that we need to understand groups because they can be very powerful, can effect greater change, and yet the group as a whole may not have a strong conscience (see Diffusion of responsibility). He says we sometimes fail to hold groups (e.g. corporations) responsible because of the difficulties described above. Collective responsibility is important to sort out, and Petitt insists that groups should have limited rights, and various obligations and checks on their power.\n\nThe discursive dilemma (which concerns general proposition sets) can be seen as a generalization of the Condorcet paradox (which concerns preference sets, a kind of proposition set). Furthermore, the Condorcet paradox can be generalized to Arrow's theorem. List and Pettit argue that the discursive dilemma can be likewise generalized to a sort of \"List-Pettit theorem\". Their theorem states that the inconsistencies remain for any aggregation method which meets a few natural conditions.\n\n"}

{"id": "350945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=350945", "title": "Eliminative materialism", "text": "Eliminative materialism\n\nEliminative materialism (also called eliminativism) is the claim that people's common-sense understanding of the mind (or folk psychology) is false and that certain classes of mental states that most people believe in do not exist. It is a materialist position in the philosophy of mind. Some supporters of eliminativism argue that no coherent neural basis will be found for many everyday psychological concepts such as belief or desire, since they are poorly defined. Rather, they argue that psychological concepts of behaviour and experience should be judged by how well they reduce to the biological level. Other versions entail the non-existence of conscious mental states such as pain and visual perceptions.\n\nEliminativism about a class of entities is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist about the existence of luminiferous aether. Eliminative \"materialism\" is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland, and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.\n\nIn the context of materialist understandings of psychology, eliminativism stands in opposition to reductive materialism which argues that mental states as conventionally understood \"do\" exist, and that they directly correspond to the physical state of the nervous system. An intermediate position is revisionary materialism, which will often argue that the mental state in question will prove to be \"somewhat\" reducible to physical phenomena—with some changes needed to the common sense concept.\n\nSince eliminative materialism claims that future research will fail to find a neuronal basis for various mental phenomena, it must necessarily wait for science to progress further. One might question the position on these grounds, but other philosophers like Churchland argue that eliminativism is often necessary in order to open the minds of thinkers to new evidence and better explanations.\n\nVarious arguments have been put forth both for and against eliminative materialism over the last forty years. Most of the arguments in favor of the view are based on the assumption that people's commonsense view of the mind is actually an implicit theory. It is to be compared and contrasted with other scientific theories in its explanatory success, accuracy, and ability to allow people to make correct predictions about the future. Eliminativists argue that, based on these and other criteria, commonsense \"folk\" psychology has failed and will eventually need to be replaced with explanations derived from the neurosciences. These philosophers therefore tend to emphasize the importance of neuroscientific research as well as developments in artificial intelligence to sustain their thesis.\n\nPhilosophers who argue against eliminativism may take several approaches. Simulation theorists, like Robert Gordon and Alvin Goldman argue that folk psychology is not a theory, but rather depends on internal simulation of others, and therefore is not subject to falsification in the same way that theories are. Jerry Fodor, among others, argues that folk psychology is, in fact, a successful (even indispensable) theory. Another view is that eliminativism assumes the existence of the beliefs and other entities it seeks to \"eliminate\" and is thus self-refuting.\nEliminativism maintains that the common-sense understanding of the mind is mistaken, and that the neurosciences will one day reveal that the mental states that are talked about in everyday discourse, using words such as \"intend\", \"believe\", \"desire\", and \"love\", do not refer to anything real. Because of the inadequacy of natural languages, people mistakenly think that they have such beliefs and desires. Some eliminativists, such as Frank Jackson, claim that consciousness does not exist except as an epiphenomenon of brain function; others, such as Georges Rey, claim that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses. Consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues and it is possible to take an eliminative stance on one but not the other. The roots of eliminativism go back to the writings of Wilfred Sellars, W.V. Quine, Paul Feyerabend, and Richard Rorty. The term \"eliminative materialism\" was first introduced by James Cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by Rorty. The later Ludwig Wittgenstein was also an important inspiration for eliminativism, particularly with his attack on \"private objects\" as \"grammatical fictions\".\n\nEarly eliminativists such as Rorty and Feyerabend often confused two different notions of the sort of elimination that the term \"eliminative materialism\" entailed. On the one hand, they claimed, the cognitive sciences that will ultimately give people a correct account of the workings of the mind will not employ terms that refer to common-sense mental states like beliefs and desires; these states will not be part of the ontology of a mature cognitive science. But critics immediately countered that this view was indistinguishable from the identity theory of mind. Quine himself wondered what exactly was so eliminative about eliminative materialism after all:\n\nOn the other hand, the same philosophers also claimed that common-sense mental states simply do not exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be explained in terms of lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain in the same way that demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.\n\nWhile it was a minority view in the 1960s, eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during the 1980s. Proponents of this view, such as B.F. Skinner, often made parallels to previous superseded scientific theories (such as that of the four humours, the phlogiston theory of combustion, and the vital force theory of life) that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis about the nature of the mental. In these cases, science has not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories, but rejected them altogether as obsolete. Radical behaviorists, such as Skinner, argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and should be replaced by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment. Such views were eventually abandoned. Patricia and Paul Churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures.\n\nEliminativism is not only motivated by philosophical considerations, but is also a prediction about what form future scientific theories will take. Eliminativist philosophers therefore tend to be concerned with the data coming from the relevant brain and cognitive sciences. In addition, because eliminativism is essentially predictive in nature, different theorists can, and often do, make different predictions about which aspects of folk psychology will be eliminated from folk psychological vocabulary. None of these philosophers are eliminativists \"tout court\".\n\nToday, the eliminativist view is most closely associated with the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered to be an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to summarize the difference between the Churchlands's views and Dennett's view is that the Churchlands are eliminativists when it comes to propositional attitudes, but reductionists concerning qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist with respect to propositional attitudes, and an eliminativist concerning qualia.\n\nEliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland argue that folk psychology is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It is used to explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view is often referred to as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.\n\nSuch eliminativists have developed different arguments to show that folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory and needs to be abolished. They argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.\n\nFolk psychology retains characteristics of now obsolete theories or legends from the past. Ancient societies tried to explain the physical mysteries of nature by ascribing mental conditions to them in such statements as \"the sea is angry\". Gradually, these everyday folk psychological explanations were replaced by more efficient scientific descriptions. Today, eliminativists argue, there is no reason not to accept an effective scientific account of people's cognitive abilities. If such an explanation existed, then there would be no need for folk-psychological explanations of behavior, and the latter would be eliminated the same way as the mythological explanations the ancients used.\n\nAnother line of argument is the meta-induction based on what eliminativists view as the disastrous historical record of folk theories in general. Ancient pre-scientific \"theories\" of folk biology, folk physics, and folk cosmology have all proven to be radically wrong. Eliminativists argue the same in the case of folk psychology. There seems no logical basis, to the eliminativist, for making an exception just because folk psychology has lasted longer and is more intuitive or instinctively plausible than the other folk theories. Indeed, the eliminativists warn, considerations of intuitive plausibility may be precisely the result of the deeply entrenched nature in society of folk psychology itself. It may be that people's beliefs and other such states are as theory-laden as external perceptions and hence intuitions will tend to be biased in favor of them.\n\nMuch of folk psychology involves the attribution of intentional states (or more specifically as a subclass, propositional attitudes). Eliminativists point out that these states are generally ascribed syntactic and semantic properties. An example of this is the language of thought hypothesis, which attributes a discrete, combinatorial syntax and other linguistic properties to these mental phenomena. Eliminativists argue that such discrete and combinatorial characteristics have no place in the neurosciences, which speak of action potentials, spiking frequencies, and other effects which are continuous and distributed in nature. Hence, the syntactic structures which are assumed by folk psychology can have no place in such a structure as the brain. Against this there have been two responses. On the one hand, there are philosophers who deny that mental states are linguistic in nature and see this as a straw man argument. The other view is represented by those who subscribe to \"a language of thought\". They assert that the mental states can be multiply realized and that functional characterizations are just higher-level characterizations of what's happening at the physical level.\n\nIt has also been argued against folk psychology that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning is determined by the things that they are about in the external world. This makes it difficult to explain how they can play the causal roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes.\n\nIn recent years, this latter argument has been fortified by the theory of connectionism. Many connectionist models of the brain have been developed in which the processes of language learning and other forms of representation are highly distributed and parallel. This would tend to indicate that there is no need for such discrete and semantically endowed entities as beliefs and desires.\n\nThe thesis of eliminativism seems to be so obviously wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies from the history of science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.\n\nBut even if one accepts the susceptibility to error of people's intuitions, the objection can be reformulated: if the existence of mental conditions seems perfectly obvious and is central in people's conception of the world, then enormously strong arguments are needed in order to successfully deny the existence of mental conditions. Furthermore, these arguments, to be consistent, need to be formulated in a way which does not pre-suppose the existence of entities like \"mental states\", \"logical arguments\", and \"ideas\", otherwise they are self-contradictory. Those who accept this objection say that the arguments in favor of eliminativism are far too weak to establish such a radical claim; therefore there is no reason to believe in eliminativism.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have attempted to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing that in order to assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.\n\nGeorges Rey and Michael Devitt reply to this objection by invoking deflationary semantic theories that avoid analysing predicates like \"x is true\" as expressing a real property. They are construed, instead, as logical devices so that asserting that a sentence is true is just a quoted way of asserting the sentence itself. To say, \"'God exists' is true\" is just to say, \"God exists\". This way, Rey and Devitt argue, insofar as dispositional replacements of \"claims\" and deflationary accounts of \"true\" are coherent, eliminativism is not self-refuting.\n\nAnother problem for the eliminativist is the consideration that human beings undergo subjective experiences and, hence, their conscious mental states have qualia. Since qualia are generally regarded as characteristics of mental states, their existence does not seem to be compatible with eliminativism. Eliminativists, such as Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey, respond by rejecting qualia. This is seen to be problematic to opponents of eliminativists, since many claim that the existence of qualia seems perfectly obvious. Many philosophers consider the \"elimination\" of qualia implausible, if not incomprehensible. They assert that, for instance, the existence of pain is simply beyond denial.\n\nAdmitting that the existence of qualia seems obvious, Dennett nevertheless states that \"qualia\" is a theoretical term from an outdated metaphysics stemming from Cartesian intuitions. He argues that a precise analysis shows that the term is in the long run empty and full of contradictions. The eliminativist's claim with respect to qualia is that there is no unbiased evidence for such experiences when regarded as something more than propositional attitudes. In other words, they do not deny that pain exists, but that it exists independently of its effect on behavior. Influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\", Dennett and Rey have defended eliminativism about qualia, even when other portions of the mental are accepted.\n\nSome philosophers argue that folk psychology is a quite successful theory. Simulation theorists doubt that people's understanding of the mental can be explained in terms of a theory at all. Rather they argue that people's understanding of others is based on internal simulations of how they would act and respond in similar situations. Jerry Fodor is one of the objectors that believes in folk psychology's success as a theory, because it makes for an effective way of communication in everyday life that can be implemented with few words. Such an effectiveness could never be achieved with a complex neuroscientific terminology.\n\n\n\n"}

The Druze claim that an understanding of these is necessary, but that their \"al-ʻUqqāl\" (عقال), (\"the Knowledgeable Initiates\") have access to writings of their own that supersede these. The Epistles of Wisdom are also referred to as the Kitab al-Hikma (Book of Wisdom) and Al-Hikma al-Sharifa. Other ancient Druze writings include the \"Rasa'il al-Hind (Epistles of India)\" and the previously lost (or hidden) manuscripts such as \"al-Munfarid bi-Dhatihi\" and \"al-Sharia al-Ruhaniyya\" as well as others including didactic and polemic treatises.\n\nThe Epistles of Wisdom were written in the Arabic language and contain one hundred and eleven epistles in total. They are organised into six books first compiled by one of the greatest Druze sages 'Abd-Allah Al-Tanukhi in 1479 AD. According to oral traditions there were originally twenty-four books. Eighteen are reasonably assumed to have been lost, hidden or destroyed. Epistle number six is dated earliest and was written in July 1017 AD by Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and he is specifically mentioned as the author of thirty more epistles in the first two books. Epistles 109 and 110 are dated latest, written by Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin in 1042 AD. Epistles 36 to 40 are attributed to Isma'il al-Tamimi ibn Muhammad. The first epistle opens with the goodbye message from Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the original teacher of the Druze. He details his efforts to assist his people's welfare and peace and urges them to remain upright.\n\nThe Druze religious establishment's interpretation of \"taqiyya\" (تقیة) and the esoteric nature of the faith led to the restriction of access, inquiry and investigation from even their own uninitiated Druze known as \"al-Juhhāl\" (جهال) (\"the Ignorant\") or \"jismaniyeen\" (\"the Material Ones\"). Such restrictions aimed to prevent possible damage to the individual and community if the writings were interpreted incorrectly, since the study of the Epistles of Wisdom is better accompanied by commentary texts and guidance from the higher ranking Druze \"Uqqal\" (\"Knowledgeable Ones\").\n\nDruze manuscripts are generally written in a language, grammar and diction that, to the uninitiated is hard to understand and includes ambiguous words and highly obscure and cryptic phrases, in-addition to the extensive usage of symbology and numerology in much of the writings.\n\nA Syrian physician gave one of the first Druze manuscripts to Louis XIV in 1700, which is now kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale. Local disturbances such as the invasion of Ibrahim Pasha between 1831 and 1838, along with the 1860 Lebanon conflict caused some of these texts to fall into the hands of academics. Other original manuscripts are held in the Robert Garrett collection at Princeton University. Sami Makarem has published sections of the works in English with commentary from a Druze compendium held in the Shaykh Nasib Makarem collection in Aytat, Lebanon. The first French translation was published in 1838 by linguist and orientalist Antoine Isaac, Baron Silvestre de Sacy in \"Expose de la religion des Druzes\".\n\nAnother edition of the \"Rasa'il al-hikma\" was published by pseudonymous writers in Lebanon in 1986 as part of the highly controversial \"The Hard Truth\" series which included several anti-Druze, anti-Alawite and anti-Islamic books and was banned by the authorities for containing misleading information and hate speech, also an unpublished dissertation by David Bryer was prepared on the first two volumes. A French translation and critical examination of these first two volumes (epistles one to forty) from the Epistles of Wisdom was published in 2007 by Daniel de Smet who has provided a doctrinal introduction, notes, a description and inventory of the manuscripts and studies of their contents and characteristics.\n\nThe epistles contain philosophical discourses about Neoplatonic and Gnostic subjects, Ptolemaic cosmology, Arabic paraphrases of the philosophies of Farabi, Plotinus and Proclus, writings on the Universal Soul along with several polemic epistles concerning other faiths and philosophies that were present during that time and towards individuals who were considered renegades or those who tried to distort and tarnish the reputation of the faith and its teachings such as the \"Answering the Nusayri\" epistle and the fifth volume of the Epistles. Most of the Epistles are written in a post-classical language, often showing similarities to Arab Christian authors. The texts provide formidable insight into the incorporation of the Universal Intellect and Soul of the world in 11th century Egypt, when the deity showed itself to men through Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim and his doctrines. These display a notable form of Arabic Neoplatonism blended with Ismailism and adopted Christian elements of great interest for the philosophy and history of religions. It is believed by the Druze from interpretation of the epistles that Al-Hakim did not die, but merely withdrew into occultation and will return one day and reveal the Druze wisdom to the world in order to inaugurate a golden age.\n\nOn the concept of God, Hamza ibn Ali wrote\n\nOn the concept of reincarnation and the universal soul, Baha'uddin wrote \n\nOn the concept of atheism, Baha'uddin argued \n\nRegarding the secrecy of the epistles of wisdom, Hamza ibn Ali wrote \nHowever he did remark \n\nWith regards the unity of God and how to remain in a state of peace of mind and contentment (Rida (Arabic: رضا)) and find knowledge of true love, Hamza ibn Ali left us a message \n\n"}
{"id": "32888804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32888804", "title": "Everett Hall", "text": "Everett Hall\n\nEverett Wesley Hall (April 24, 1901 – June 17, 1960) was an American philosopher, known for his advocacy of common-sense realism and his notion of what he called the \"categorial\" primacy of certain assertions. Hall received his A.B. and M.A. degrees from Lawrence College, and his Ph.D. from Cornell University (in 1929). Between 1929 and his death in 1960, he taught at the following universities: the University of Chicago, Ohio State, Stanford, the University of Iowa, and the University of North Carolina (he was Department Chairman at the last two schools and was Kenan Professor at North Carolina). He also held visiting appointments at Northwestern University, the University of Southern California, and Kyoto University. Hall was the author of four books as well as numerous papers. The books are \"What is Value\" (1952), \"Modern Science and Human Values\"(1956), \"Philosophical Systems\"(1960), and \"Our Knowledge of Fact and Value\" (1961). After his death a number of his papers were collected by his colleague, E. M. Adams and published as \"Categorial Analysis\" (1964).\n\nHall's philosophy was a linguistic variant of naive realism according to which values as well as physical objects and properties are much as generally understood by common sense. He was thus in the tradition of 18th-century Scottish realist, Thomas Reid. In spite of his claimed adherence to common sense and the \"grammar\" of ordinary language, Hall was an advocate of mind-body identity theory, claiming that some neurological events simply have a \"mental dimension.\" His was, however, a property-dualistic version of identity theory, since he took Intentionality to be irreducible. In the theory of perception, he argued that perceptual errors and hallucinations can be explained by various properties being present in a manner other than exemplification. Such \"ascriptions\" of sensuous properties give evidence, but never provide certainty that the represented properties are also exemplified. This \"intentional realism\" in his view made the sense-data theory unnecessary. His views on perception are akin to later representationists such as Gilbert Harman, William Lycan and Fred Dretske, and \"color realists\" such as J. J. C. Smart, D. M. Armstrong, Alex Byrne, and Michael Tye. Hall's denial that the commonsense worldview must eventually be supplanted by a \"scientific image\" foreshadows positions later taken by Amie Thomasson. His view that Coherentism provides a reasonable foundation for human knowledge only if certain (perceptual) experiences provide their own inherent evidence was a precursor to the Foundherentism of Susan Haack.\n\nHall's meta-ethical views were similarly characterized by the belief that emotions, also being intentional (in Franz Brentano's sense), provide evidence of the presence of various values in the world. However, Hall did not agree with G. E. Moore that values are non-natural properties. In his view, values are neither properties nor relations: they are unnameable \"ought-to-be-exemplifieds\". A's being F is good \"if, and only if\" \"it were good\" that A be F. He held that values are in this way akin to semantic dimensions, like truth. That is, just as \"Snow is white\" is true if, and only if snow is white, Jones being saved is called for, if and only if \"it were good that Jones be saved.\" His views regarding what may be named and what can only be \"shown\" by the grammar of one's language was heavily influenced by Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\". His normative ethics involved support for a consequentialism that maximizes \"implementable free choices\" as well as a complaint that the purely negative liberties supported by Natural Rights theory at least since the time of John Locke are insufficient for contemporary society. This position is set forth in his 1943 paper \"An Ethics for Today\".\n\nIn metaphilosophy, Hall held that there could be neither empirical nor deductive proofs of the superiority of one basic philosophy over another (say, of realism over phenomenalism), because he took preference of one or the other to be a function of acceptance of the view's basic categories, an attitude he called \"categorial commitment\". We are all, he claimed, trapped within a \"categorio-centric predicament\", since we cannot step outside of all categorial frameworks to determine which is best from some preferable outside footing. All we can do is try to determine which is most consonant with both common sense and modern science (which he denied were in irresolvable conflict). Cognizers do this, in his view, by examining what Hall called \"the grammar of common sense\", which he contrasted with individual common-sense beliefs such as those (like \"Here are two hands\") included in G.E.Moore's famous list. It was Hall's view that any philosophical position that conflicts too deeply or frequently with those features of common sense that are reflected in the basic grammatical forms that natural languages can take will be implausible not only to non-philosophers, but to philosophers as well when they are not actively engaging in revisionary metaphysics.\n\nIn 1966, The \"Southern Journal of Philosophy\" published a \"festschrift\" in Hall's honor which contained papers by, among others, his former colleague Wilfrid Sellars and his former student Romane Clark.\n\n"}

It contains a pair of combat boots to represent every American soldier and marine that has died in the war, as well as shoes representing Iraqi civilians who have lost their lives during the invasion and occupation. The exhibit was first shown in Chicago's Federal Plaza in January 2004. At that time, the exhibit contained 504 pairs of boots.\n\nAs of March 2007, the national exhibit contained over 3,400 pairs of boots and had visited more than 100 cities in 40 states. However, as a result of its unmanageable size, the exhibit has been broken down state-by-state. Currently, nearly every state has its own state exhibit. The national exhibit in its entirety would currently contain more than 4,000 pairs of empty boots.\n\nAccording to the American Friends Service Committee, the intent of the exhibit is to present a visual reminder of the \"human cost\" of the Iraq War and provide a place for public mourning. Based on public information, the American Friends Service Committee writes the name, age, rank and home state of each soldier and attaches it to a representative pair of boots. As the exhibit travels across the country, family members, friends and sympathizers leave flags, flowers and other mementos with individual pairs of boots. If a family wishes to have their child's name removed from the exhibit, AFSC will replace the serviceman's name with the information \"name removed request of family\". September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows co-sponsors the exhibit.\n\nIn addition to boots representing the deaths of service men and women, AFSC has collected shoes representing Iraqis who have lost their lives during occupation. Few names of Iraqi dead are known. Raed Jarrar, an Iraqi social activist, has collected the names of several thousand Iraqi civilians. These are the names that appear on tags of civilian shoes at \"Eyes Wide Open\" exhibits and for another exhibit entitled, \"Dreams and Nightmares\". AFSC’s Dreams and Nightmares is a memorial to Iraqi civilians that includes photographs and stories of individuals who have lost their lives during occupation.\n\nSince the inauguration of the original exhibit, several other exhibits have been created to assist in the original one's goal.\n\nThe national exhibit had grown so large by spring of 2007 that it had become difficult to transport by semi-truck. As a result, it has been divided into state exhibits. Illinois established the first state exhibit in August 2006. As of July 2008, there are 48 state exhibits: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, two in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine/Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri/Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York/New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. With the conclusion of the national exhibit, all but six states currently have their own exhibit. All of the \"Eyes Wide Open\" state exhibits continue to be under the leadership of The American Friends Service Committee.\n\nThe National Guard Exhibit was created in summer of 2005 and contains 400+ pairs of boots for National Guard soldiers that have lost their lives in Iraq. The exhibit often also displays the boots of all soldiers lost from the exhibition state. In addition, the exhibit contains 50 pairs of civilian shoes representing the Iraqi civilians killed during occupation. The exhibit has visited more than 30 cities in 22 states. National Guard units are not often sent abroad.\n\nAt the conclusion of the National Eyes Wide Open Exhibit in June 2007, AFSC introduced the Cost of War Exhibit. The Exhibit contains ten 7 by 3 foot vinyl, full-color banners that compare the U.S. budget for the War in Iraq to the U.S. budget for human needs such as health care and education. Based on a report by economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, one day of the Iraq War costs the U.S. $720 million or $500,000 per minute. In partnership with The National Priorities Project, AFSC has used these numbers on the daily cost of the Iraq War to determine how many human services one day of the Iraq War budget could cover. For example, \"one day of the Iraq War\" would buy 1,153,846 children school lunches for a year or provide 163,525 adults with full health coverage for one year. This exhibit is either shown alone or in conjunction with Eyes Wide Open Exhibits. There are currently 17 Cost of War Exhibits.\n\nAlarming studies of the suicide rate among veterans returning from the Iraq War led to the addition of a Veteran Suicide component to several state exhibits. Veteran suicides are considered a \"hidden casualty count\" of the Iraq War and are represented by white combat boots.\n\nThe exhibit was featured in blues musician Robert Cray’s music video for \"Twenty\". The song \"Twenty\" tells the story of a fictional serviceman who returns to The U.S. haunted by his experience in Iraq. The video stars an actual Iraq War veteran, 23-year-old Aidan Delgado. Cray did not know of the \"Eyes Wide Open\" exhibit when he came up with the concept for the song, but realized that the exhibit would be a meaningful way for the character in his song to come to terms with the death he faced in Iraq. Robert Cray’s album, also titled \"Twenty\" was nominated for a Grammy as Best Contemporary Blues Album of 2006.\n\n"}
{"id": "573880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=573880", "title": "Fine-tuned Universe", "text": "Fine-tuned Universe\n\nThe fine-tuned universe is the proposition that the conditions that allow life in the universe can occur only when certain universal dimensionless physical constants lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.\n\nVarious possible explanations of ostensible fine-tuning are discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents and detractors of creationism. The fine-tuned universe observation is closely related to, but is not exactly synonymous with, the anthropic principle, which is often used as an explanation of apparent fine-tuning.\n\nIn 1913, the chemist Lawrence Joseph Henderson (1878–1942) wrote \"The Fitness of the Environment,\" one of the first books to explore concepts of fine tuning in the universe. Henderson discusses the importance of water and the environment with respect to living things, pointing out that life depends entirely on the very specific environmental conditions on Earth, especially with regard to the prevalence and properties of water.\n\nIn 1961, physicist Robert H. Dicke claimed that certain forces in physics, such as gravity and electromagnetism, must be perfectly fine-tuned for life to exist anywhere in the universe. Fred Hoyle also argued for a fine-tuned universe in his 1984 book \"Intelligent Universe\". He compares \"the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of amino acids to a star system full of blind men solving Rubik's Cube simultaneously\".\n\nJohn Gribbin and Martin Rees wrote a detailed history and defence of the fine-tuning argument in their book \"Cosmic Coincidences\" (1989). According to Gribbin and Rees, \"The conditions in our Universe really do seem to be uniquely suitable for life forms like ourselves, and perhaps even for any form of organic complexity. But the question remains - \"is\" the Universe tailor-made for man?\"\n\nThe premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the dimensionless physical constants would make the universe radically different. As Stephen Hawking has noted, \"The laws of science, as we know them at present, contain many fundamental numbers, like the size of the electric charge of the electron and the ratio of the masses of the proton and the electron. ... The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life.\"\n\nIf, for example, the strong nuclear force were 2% stronger than it is (i.e. if the coupling constant representing its strength were 2% larger), while the other constants were left unchanged, diprotons would be stable; according to physicist Paul Davies, hydrogen would fuse into them instead of deuterium and helium. This would drastically alter the physics of stars, and presumably preclude the existence of life similar to what we observe on Earth. The existence of the diproton would short-circuit the slow fusion of hydrogen into deuterium. Hydrogen would fuse so easily that it is likely that all of the universe's hydrogen would be consumed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang. This \"diproton argument\" is disputed by other physicists, who calculate that as long as the increase in strength is less than 50%, stellar fusion could occur despite the existence of stable diprotons.\n\nThe precise formulation of the idea is made difficult by the fact that physicists do not yet know how many independent physical constants there are. The current standard model of particle physics has 25 freely adjustable parameters and general relativity has one additional parameter, the cosmological constant, which is known to be non-zero, but profoundly small in value. However, because the standard model is not mathematically self-consistent under certain conditions (e.g., at very high energies, at which both quantum mechanics and general relativity are relevant), physicists believe that it is underlaid by some other theory, such as a grand unified theory, string theory, or loop quantum gravity. In some candidate theories, the actual number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant, but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, \"the small value of the cosmological constant is telling us that a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics, the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics.\"\n\nMartin Rees formulates the fine-tuning of the universe in terms of the following six dimensionless physical constants.\n\n\nAn older example is the Hoyle state, the third-lowest energy state of the carbon-12 nucleus, with an energy of 7.656 MeV above the ground level. According to one calculation, if the state's energy level was lower than 7.3 or greater than 7.9 MeV, insufficient carbon would exist to support life. Furthermore, to explain the universe's abundance of carbon, the Hoyle state must be further tuned to a value between 7.596 and 7.716 MeV. A similar calculation, focusing on the underlying fundamental constants that give rise to various energy levels, concludes that the strong force must be tuned to a precision of at least 0.5%, and the electromagnetic force to a precision of at least 4%, to prevent either carbon production or oxygen production from dropping significantly.\n\nPhysicist Paul Davies has asserted that \"There is now broad agreement among physicists and cosmologists that the universe is in several respects 'fine-tuned' for life\". However, he continues, \"the conclusion is not so much that the universe is fine-tuned for life; rather it is fine-tuned for the building blocks and environments that life requires.\" He also states that anthropic' reasoning fails to distinguish between minimally biophilic universes, in which life is permitted, but only marginally possible, and optimally biophilic universes, in which life flourishes because abiogenesis occurs frequently\". Among scientists who find the evidence persuasive, a variety of explanations have been proposed, such as the anthropic principle along with multiple universes. George F. R. Ellis states \"that no possible astronomical observations can ever see those other universes. The arguments are indirect at best. And even if the multiverse exists, it leaves the deep mysteries of nature unexplained.\"\n\nRegarding recently discovered dark energy and its implication on the cosmological constant, Leonard Susskind says \"The great mystery is not why there is dark energy. The great mystery is why there is so little of it [10]... The fact that we are just on the knife edge of existence, [that] if dark energy were very much bigger we wouldn’t be here, that's the mystery.\" A slightly larger quantity of dark energy, or a slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused space to expand rapidly enough that galaxies would not form. Despite this, Susskind does not necessarily see the universe as being fine-tuned, suggesting that some parts of the \"megaverse\" in which we live might just, by chance, be suitable for the emergence of life, while other parts might not be.\n\nSteven Weinberg rejects the argument about the fine-tuning of the carbon cycle, arguing that \"the fine-tuning of the constants of nature here does not seem so fine\". He acknowledges that he currently has no explanation (apart from a multiverse) for the smallness of the cosmological constant, but cautions that \"It is still too early to tell whether there is some fundamental principle that can explain why the cosmological constant must be this small.\"\n\nPhysicist Victor Stenger objected to the fine-tuning, and especially to theist use of fine-tuning arguments. His numerous criticisms included what he called \"the wholly unwarranted assumption that only carbon-based life is possible.\" In turn, the astrophysicist Luke Barnes has criticised much of Stenger's work.\n\nThe validity of fine tuning examples is sometimes questioned on the grounds that such reasoning is subjective anthropomorphism applied to natural physical constants. Critics also suggest that the fine-tuned universe assertion and the anthropic principle are essentially tautologies.\n\nThe fine-tuned universe argument has also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, as it assumes no other forms of life, sometimes referred to as carbon chauvinism. Conceptually, alternative biochemistry or other forms of life are possible. Regarding this, Stenger argued: \"We have no reason to believe that our kind of carbon-based life is all that is possible. Furthermore, modern cosmology theorises that multiple universes may exist with different constants and laws of physics. So, it is not surprising that we live in the one suited for us. The universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the universe.\"\n\nIn addition, critics argue that humans are adapted to the universe through the process of evolution, rather than the universe being adapted to humans (see puddle thinking, below). They also see it as an example of the logical flaw of hubris or anthropocentrism in its assertion that humans are the purpose of the universe.\n\nThere are fine tuning arguments that are naturalistic. As modern cosmology developed, various hypotheses have been proposed. One is an oscillatory universe or a multiverse, where fundamental physical constants are postulated to resolve themselves to random values in different iterations of reality. Under this hypothesis, separate parts of reality would have wildly different characteristics. In such scenarios, the appearance of fine-tuning is explained as a consequence of the weak anthropic principle and selection bias (specifically survivor bias) that only those universes with fundamental constants hospitable to life (such as the universe we observe) would have living beings emerge and evolve capable of contemplating the questions of origins and of fine-tuning. All other universes would go utterly unbeheld by any such beings.\n\nThe Multiverse hypothesis proposes the existence of many universes with different physical constants, some of which are hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). Because we are intelligent beings, it is unsurprising that we find ourselves in a hospitable universe if there is such a multiverse. The Multiverse hypothesis is therefore thought to provide an elegant explanation of the finding that we exist despite the required fine-tuning. (See for a detailed discussion of the arguments for and against this suggested explanation.)\n\nThe multiverse idea has led to considerable research into the anthropic principle and has been of particular interest to particle physicists, because theories of everything do apparently generate large numbers of universes in which the physical constants vary widely. As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory do make predictions that some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence of soon. Some multiverse theories are not falsifiable, thus scientists may be reluctant to call any multiverse theory \"scientific\". UNC-Chapel Hill professor Laura Mersini-Houghton claims that the WMAP cold spot may provide testable empirical evidence for a parallel universe, although this claim was recently refuted as the WMAP cold spot was found to be nothing more than a statistical artifact.\nVariants on this approach include Lee Smolin's notion of cosmological natural selection, the Ekpyrotic universe, and the Bubble universe theory.\n\nCritics of the multiverse-related explanations argue that there is no independent evidence that other universes exist. Some criticize the inference from fine-tuning for life to a multiverse as fallacious, whereas others defend it against that challenge.\n\nStephen Hawking, along with Thomas Hertog of CERN, proposed that the universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions we see today. According to their theory, it is inevitable that we find our universe's \"fine-tuned\" physical constants, as the current universe \"selects\" only those past histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why we find ourselves in a universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the ontic existence of the Multiverse.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the universe may have been designed by extra-universal aliens. Some believe this would solve the problem of how a designer or design team capable of fine-tuning the universe could come to exist. Cosmologist Alan Guth believes humans will in time be able to generate new universes. By implication previous intelligent entities may have generated our universe. This idea leads to the possibility that the extraterrestrial designer/designers are themselves the product of an evolutionary process in their own universe, which must therefore itself be able to sustain life. However it also raises the question of where that universe came from, leading to an infinite regress.\n\nThe Designer Universe theory of John Gribbin suggests that the universe could have been made deliberately by an advanced civilization in another part of the Multiverse, and that this civilization may have been responsible for causing the Big Bang.\n\nAs with theistic evolution, some individual scientists, theologians, and philosophers as well as certain religious groups argue that providence or creation are responsible for fine-tuning.\n\nChristian philosopher Alvin Plantinga argues that random chance, applied to a single and sole universe, only raises the question as to why this universe could be so \"lucky\" as to have precise conditions that support life at least at some place (the Earth) and time (within millions of years of the present). \n\nThis fine-tuning of the universe is cited by philosopher and Christian apologist William Lane Craig as an evidence for the existence of God or some form of intelligence capable of manipulating (or designing) the basic physics that governs the universe. Craig argues, however, \"that the postulate of a divine Designer does not settle for us the religious question.\"\n\nPhilosopher and theologian Richard Swinburne reaches the design conclusion using Bayesian probability.\n\nScientist and theologian Alister McGrath has pointed out that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature’s ability to tune itself to any degree.[The entire biological] evolutionary process depends upon the unusual chemistry of carbon, which allows it to bond to itself, as well as other elements, creating highly complex molecules that are stable over prevailing terrestrial temperatures, and are capable of conveying genetic information (especially DNA). […] Whereas it might be argued that nature creates its own fine-tuning, this can only be done if the primordial constituents of the universe are such that an evolutionary process can be initiated. The unique chemistry of carbon is the ultimate foundation of the capacity of nature to tune itself.\n\nTheoretical physicist and Anglican priest John Polkinghorne has stated: \"Anthropic fine tuning is too remarkable to be dismissed as just a happy accident.\"\n\nProponents of intelligent design argue that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection. The fine-tuned universe argument is a central premise or presented as given in many of the published works of prominent intelligent design proponents, such as William A. Dembski and Michael Behe.\n\nMark Colyvan, Jay Garfield and Graham Priest (2005) have argued that a theistic explanation for fine tuning is faulted due to fallacious probabilistic reasoning.\n\nMathematician Michael Ikeda and astronomer William H. Jefferys have argued that the anthropic principle and selection effect are not properly taken into account in the fine tuning argument for a designer, and that in taking them into account, fine tuning does not support the designer hypothesis. Philosopher of science Elliott Sober makes a similar argument.\n\nPhysicist Robert L. Park has also criticized the theistic interpretation of fine-tuning:\n\nVictor Stenger argues that \"The fine-tuning argument and other recent intelligent design arguments are modern versions of God-of-the-gaps reasoning, where a God is deemed necessary whenever science has not fully explained some phenomenon\". Stenger argues that science may provide an explanation if a Theory of Everything is formulated, which he says may reveal connections between the physical constants. A change in one physical constant may be compensated by a change in another, suggesting that the apparent fine-tuning of the universe is a fallacy because, in hypothesizing the apparent fine-tuning, it is mistaken to vary one physical parameter while keeping the others constant.\n\nImagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, “This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!” This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of a spiritual lineage of female practitioners, or yogini, a nunnery of 350 nuns and the heart of a renowned practice tradition. Gebchak’s practices come mainly from the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, while the Nunnery has been closely affiliated over its history with the Drukpa Kagyu lineage and with the Nangchen royal family. \n\nGebchak Gonpa is renowned for its training of female practitioners, and its large number of branch nunneries and monasteries following its practice traditions. Gebchak's yogini nuns are famed for their accomplishments in profound yogas and meditation, particularly in tsa lung and Dzogchen. Elderly nuns resident today say they witnessed practitioners attain the rainbow body of spiritual accomplishment in the early days of the nunnery.\n\nThe first Tsoknyi Rinpoche instructed his heart son, Tsang-Yang Gyamtso, to build nunneries so that women would have the opportunity to practice. Prior to that, there had been an almost complete absence of female monastic communities in Nangchen for spiritually-minded women to join. Tsang-Yang Gyamtso founded Gebchak Gonpa in 1892 and over time great numbers of women came from many parts of Tibet to join in its unique system of practice. According to Tulku Urgyen:\nTsang-Yang followed Tsoknyi’s command and built two major nunneries, one of which had thirteen retreat centers. His benefit for beings became broader than his master’s. Most of the nuns practiced the revealed treasures of Ratna Lingpa, which include Hayagriva as well as the peaceful and wrathful deities. Each retreat center focused on a different cycle of these treasures.\nGebchak Gonpa's intensive retreat system includes a three-year retreat for all nuns followed by entry into one of sixteen retreat divisions, where they remain in practice for the rest of their lives. The Nunnery’s practice system follows the terma (revealed treasure) collection of Ratna Lingpa, and Tsang-Yang Gyamtso’s 16 volumes of commentary adapting the Ratna Lingpa practices to the needs of his disciples.\n\nDuring the cultural revolution of the 1960s Gebchak Gonpa was destroyed and the remaining nuns were dispersed, threatening to destroy the tradition entirely. \n\nToday, new generations of nuns and lamas are preserving Gebchak’s practice lineage. The majority of Gebchak’s nuns today are 45-55 years old, and were trained in all aspects of their practice lineage by the elderly nuns who had survived the Cultural Revolution. Beginning in China’s open and reform era of the 1980s, these elderly nuns and a group of new nuns rebuilt and re-established Gebchak Gonpa, despite extreme physical hardships. Even today, Gebchak Gonpa’s remote, high altitude location and rough physical conditions are challenging for the average visitor. It is a community of nuns for whom the contemplative quality of Buddhist practice takes precedence over the outer, material world. \n\nThe third reincarnation of Tsang-Yang Gyamtso is cherished by the nuns as the head guru of Gebchak Gonpa. Tsoknyi Rinpoche is also a key root guru of the Gebchak nuns and their lineage. Four Gebchak lamas presently live in Nangchen and look after the Nunnery’s religious and practical affairs: Tsang-Yang Gyamtso III, Tsogyal Rinpoche III, Ngaksam Rinpoche III and Wangdrak Rinpoche III. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2452856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2452856", "title": "Giovanni Vailati", "text": "Giovanni Vailati\n\nGiovanni Vailati (24 April 1863 – 14 May 1909) was an Italian proto-analytic philosopher, historian of science, and mathematician.\n\nVailati was born in Crema, Lombardy, and studied engineering at the University of Turin. He went on to lecture in the history of mechanics there from 1896 to 1899, after working as assistant to Giuseppe Peano and Vito Volterra. He resigned his university post in 1899 so that he could pursue his independent studies, making a living from high-school mathematics teaching. During his lifetime he became internationally known, his writings having been translated into English, French, and Polish, though he was largely forgotten after his death in Rome. He was rediscovered in the late 1950s. He did not publish any complete books, but left about 200 essays and reviews across a range of academic disciplines.\n\nVailati's view of philosophy was that it provided a preparation and the tools for scientific work. For that reason, and because philosophy should be neutral between rival beliefs, conceptions, theoretical structures, etc., the philosopher should avoid the use of special technical language, but should use the language that he finds used in those areas in which he is interested. That is not to say that the philosopher should merely accept whatever he finds; an ordinary-language term may be problematic, but its deficiencies should be corrected rather than replacing it with some new technical term.\n\nHis view of truth and meaning was influenced by philosophers such as C.S. Peirce and Ernst Mach. He carefully distinguished between meaning and truth: \"the question of determining \"what we mean\" when we propound a given proposition is entirely different from the question of deciding \"whether it is true or false\". Nevertheless, having decided what is meant, the work of deciding whether it is true or false is crucial. Vailati held a moderate positivist view, in both science and philosophy:\n\n\"it must be demanded of anybody who advances a thesis that he be capable of indicating the facts which according to him should obtain (or have obtained) if his thesis were true, and also their difference from other facts which according to him would obtain (or have obtained) if it were not true\"\n\nVailati's influences and contacts were many and varied, belying the oversimple label often attached to him: \"the Italian pragmatist\". While owing much to Peirce and William James (between whose thought he was one of the first to distinguish), he also acknowledged the influence of Plato and George Berkeley (both of whom he saw as important precursors of, or influences on, pragmatism), Gottfried Leibniz, Victoria Welby-Gregory G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, Peano, and Franz Brentano. He corresponded with many of his contemporaries.\n\nHis early work included papers on symbolic logic, focusing on its rôle in philosophy, and distinguishing between logic and psychology and epistemology.\n\nVailata's main historical interests concerned mechanics, logic, and geometry, and he was an important contributor to a number of areas, including the study of post-Aristotelian Greek mechanics, of Galileo's predecessors, of the notion and rôle of definition in the work of Plato and Euclid, of mathematical influences on logic and epistemology, and of the non-Euclidean geometry of Gerolamo Saccheri. He was particularly interested in the ways in which what might be seen as the same problems are addressed and dealt with at different times.\n\nHis historical work was interrelated with his philosophical work, involving the same fundamental views and methodology. Vailati saw the two as differing in approach rather than subject matter, and believed that there should be co-operation between philosophers and scientists in the pursuit of historical studies. He also held that a complete history demanded that one take into account the relevant social background.\n\nOf a certain interest is the participation of Vailati in the scientific activity of the chair of \"Calculus infinitesimal\" held by Giuseppe Peano. We are in Turin in 1892. The period is full of \"Prolusions\" and there are the emergence of disciplines such as anthropology and sociology, which have produced a new scientific concept in the nineteenth century (see Antonio Santucci, \"Pragmatism in Italy\", Bologna, Il Mulino, 1963, p 157 and sg. [BNI] 63-8109) The \"Turin Prolusions\" (1896-1898) open the horizon to new discoveries and to the formulations of scientific theories and hypotheses concerning the relationship between science and its history. In this context are the famous \"questions of words\", which concern language and its functioning as a means of transmitting ideas (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, \"Giovanni Vailati. Storia e metodologia delle scienze\" and \"Giuseppe Peano, Giovanni Vailati. Contributi invisibili\", idem \"Una epistemologia senza storia\", Rome, Nuova Cultura, 2013, ).\n\nThe superseding of scientific theories and other results doesn't involve their destruction, for their importance is increased by their being superseded: \"Every error shows us a rock to be avoided, while not every discovery shows us a path to be followed\".\n\n"}

{"id": "251223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251223", "title": "John Toland", "text": "John Toland\n\nJohn Toland (30 November 1670 – 11 March 1722) was an Irish rationalist philosopher and freethinker, and occasional satirist, who wrote numerous books and pamphlets on political philosophy and philosophy of religion, which are early expressions of the philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment. Born in Ireland, he was educated at the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leiden and Oxford and was influenced by the philosophy of John Locke.\n\nHis first, and best known work, was \"Christianity not Mysterious\" (1696).\n\nVery little is known of Toland's early life. He was born in Ardagh on the Inishowen Peninsula, a predominantly Catholic and Irish-speaking region in northwestern Ireland. His parents are unknown. He would later write that he had been baptised \"Janus Junius\", a play on his name that recalled both the Roman two-faced god Janus and Junius Brutus, reputed founder of the Roman republic. According to his biographer Pierre des Maizeaux, he adopted the name John as a schoolboy with the encouragement of his school teacher.\n\nHaving formally converted from Catholicism to Protestantism at the age of 16, Toland got a scholarship to study theology at the University of Glasgow. In 1690, at age 19, the University of Edinburgh conferred a master's degree on him. He then got a scholarship to spend two years studying at University of Leiden in Holland, and subsequently nearly two years at Oxford in England (1694–95). The Leiden scholarship had been provided by wealthy English Dissenters, who hoped Toland would go on to become a minister for Dissenters.\n\nIn Toland's first book \"Christianity not Mysterious\" (1696), he argued that the divine revelation of the Bible contains no true mysteries; rather, all the dogmas of the faith can be understood and demonstrated by properly trained reason from natural principles. For this argument he was prosecuted by a grand jury in London. As he was a subject of the Kingdom of Ireland, members of the Parliament of Ireland proposed that he should be burnt at the stake, and in his absence three copies of the book were burnt by the public hangman in Dublin as the content was contrary to the core doctrines of the Church of Ireland. Toland bitterly compared the Protestant legislators to \"Popish Inquisitors who performed that Execution on the Book, when they could not seize the Author, whom they had destined to the Flames\".\n\nAfter his departure from Oxford Toland resided in London for most of the rest of his life, but was also a somewhat frequent visitor to the European continent, particularly Germany and the Netherlands. He lived on the Continent from 1707 to 1710. Toland died in Putney on 10 March 1722. The \"1911 Encyclopædia Britannica\" says of him that at his death in London at age 51 \"he died... as he had lived, in great poverty, in the midst of his books, with his pen in his hand.\" Just before he died, he composed his own epitaph: \"He was an assertor of liberty, a lover of all sorts of learning ... but no man’s follower or dependent. Nor could frowns or fortune bend him to decline from the ways he had chosen.\"\n\nVery shortly after his death a lengthy biography of Toland was written by Pierre des Maizeaux.\n\nJohn Toland was the first person called a freethinker (by Bishop Berkeley) and went on to write over a hundred books in various domains but mostly dedicated to criticising ecclesiastical institutions. A great deal of his intellectual activity was dedicated to writing political tracts in support of the Whig cause. Many scholars know him for his role as either the biographer or editor of notable republicans from the mid-17th century such as James Harrington, Algernon Sidney and John Milton. His works \"Anglia Libera\" and \"State Anatomy\" are prosaic expressions of an English republicanism which reconciles itself with constitutional monarchy.\nAfter \"Christianity Not Mysterious\", Toland's views became gradually more radical. His opposition to hierarchy in the church also led to opposition to hierarchy in the state; bishops and kings, in other words, were as bad as each other, and monarchy had no God-given sanction as a form of government. In his 1704 \"Letters to Serena\" – in which he used the expression 'pantheism' – he carefully analyses the manner by which truth is arrived at, and why people are prone to forms of 'false consciousness.'\n\nIn politics his most radical proposition was that liberty was a defining characteristic of what it means to be human. Political institutions should be designed to guarantee freedom, not simply to establish order. For Toland, reason and tolerance were the twin pillars of the good society. This was Whiggism at its most intellectually refined, the very antithesis of the Tory belief in sacred authority in both church and state. Toland's belief in the need for perfect equality among free-born citizens was extended to the Jewish community, tolerated, but still outsiders in early 18th century England. In his 1714 \"Reasons for Naturalising the Jews\" he was the first to advocate full citizenship and equal rights for Jewish people.\n\nToland's world was not all detached intellectual speculation, though. There was also an incendiary element to his political pamphleteering, and he was not beyond whipping up some of the baser anti-Catholic sentiments of the day in his attacks on the Jacobites.\n\nHe also produced some highly controversial polemics, including the \"Treatise of the Three Impostors\", in which Christianity, Judaism and Islam are all condemned as the three great political frauds. The \"Treatise of the Three Imposters\" was rumoured to exist in manuscript form since the Middle Ages and excoriated throughout all of Europe. It is now thought that the work did not exist.\n\nToland claimed to have a personal copy of the manuscript which he passed to the circle of Jean Rousset in France. Rumours that it was then translated into French were taken seriously by some: however, not by Voltaire who issued a satirical reply.\n\nHis republican sympathies were also evidenced by his editing of the writings of some of the great radicals of the 1650s, including James Harrington, Algernon Sydney, Edmund Ludlow and John Milton. In his support for the Hanoverian monarchy he somewhat moderated his republican sentiments; though his ideal kingship was one that would work towards achieving civic virtue and social harmony, a 'just liberty' and the 'preservation and improvement of our reason.' But George I and the oligarchy behind Walpole were about as far from Toland's ideal as it is possible to get. In many ways he was thus a man born both too late and too early.\n\nToland influenced Baron d'Holbach's ideas about physical motion. In his \"Letters to Serena\", Toland claimed that rest, or absence of motion, is not merely relative. Actually, for Toland, rest is a special case of motion. When there is a conflict of forces, the body that is apparently at rest is influenced by as much activity and passivity as it would be if it were moving.\n\nToland identified himself as a pantheist in his publication \"Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist\" in 1705. At the time when he wrote \"Christianity not Mysterious\" he was careful to distinguish himself from both sceptical atheists and orthodox theologians. After having formulated a stricter version of Locke's epistemological rationalism, Toland then goes on to show that there are no facts or doctrines from the Bible which are not perfectly plain, intelligible and reasonable, being neither contrary to reason nor incomprehensible to it. All revelation is human revelation; that which is not rendered understandable is to be rejected as gibberish.\n\nHowever, David Berman has argued for an atheistic reading of Toland, demonstrating contradictions between \"Christianity not Mysterious\" and Toland's \"Two Essays\" (London, 1695). Berman's reading of Toland and Charles Blount attempts to show that Toland deliberately obscured his real atheism so as to avoid prosecution whilst attempting to subliminally influence unknowing readers, specifically by creating contradictions in his work which can only be resolved by reducing Toland's God to a pantheistic one, and realising that such a non-providential God is, for Blount, Toland and Colins, \"...no God, or as good as no God...In short, the God of theism is \"blictri\" for Toland; only the determined material God of pantheism exists, and he (or it) is really no God.\"\n\nAfter his \"Christianity not Mysterious\", Toland's \"Letters to Serena\" constitute his major contribution to philosophy. In the first three letters, he develops a historical account of the rise of superstition arguing that human reason cannot ever fully liberate itself from prejudices. In the last two letters, he founds a metaphysical materialism grounded in a critique of monist substantialism. Later on, we find Toland continuing his critique of church government in \"Nazarenus\" which was first more fully developed in his \"Primitive Constitution of the Christian Church\", a clandestine writing in circulation by 1705. The first book of \"Nazarenus\" calls attention to the right of the Ebionites to a place in the early church. The thrust of his argument was to push to the very limits the applicability of canonical scripture to establish institutionalised religion. Later works of special importance include Tetradymus wherein can be found Clidophorus, a historical study of the distinction between esoteric and exoteric philosophies.\n\nHis \"Pantheisticon, sive formula celebrandae sodalitatis socraticae\" (Pantheisticon, or the Form of Celebrating the Socratic Society), of which he printed a few copies for private circulation only, gave great offence as a sort of liturgic service made up of passages from pagan authors, in imitation of the Church of England liturgy. The title also was in those days alarming, and still more so the mystery which the author threw around the question how far such societies of pantheists actually existed. The term \"pantheism\" was used by Toland to describe the philosophy of Spinoza.\n\nToland was famous for distinguishing exoteric philosophy—what one says publicly about religion—from esoteric philosophy—what one confides to trusted friends. In 2007 Fouke's \"Philosophy and Theology in a Burlesque Mode: John Toland and the Way of Paradox\" presented an analysis of Toland's 'exoteric strategy' of speaking as others speak, but with a different meaning. He argues that Toland's philosophy and theology had little to do with positive expression of beliefs, and that his philosophical aim was not to develop an epistemology, a true metaphysical system, an ideal form of governance, or the basis of ethical obligation, but to find ways to participate in the discourses of others while undermining those discourses from within. Fouke traces Toland's practices to Shaftesbury's conception of a comic or 'derisory' mode of philosophising aimed at exposing pedantry, imposture, dogmatism, and folly.\n\nToland was a man not of his time; one who advocated principles of virtue in duty, principles that had little place in the England of Robert Walpole, governed by cynicism and self-interest. His intellectual reputation, moreover, was subsequently eclipsed by the likes of John Locke and David Hume, and still more by Montesquieu and the French radical thinkers. Edmund Burke in his \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" wrote dismissively of Toland and his fellows: \"Who, born within the last 40 years, has read one word of Collins, and Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and that whole race who called themselves Freethinkers?\"\n\nStill, in \"Christianity not Mysterious\", the book for which he is best known, Toland laid down a challenge not just to the authority of the established church, but to all inherited and unquestioned authority. It was thus as radical politically and philosophically, as it was theologically.\n\nOf his influence, humanities professor Robert Pattison wrote: \"Two centuries earlier the establishment would have burned him as a heretic; two centuries later it would have made him a professor of comparative religion in a California university. In the rational Protestant climate of early 18th-century Britain, he was merely ignored to death.\"\n\nHowever, Toland managed to find success after his death: Thomas Hollis, the great 18th century book collector and editor, commissioned the London bookseller Andrew Millar to publish works advocating republican government - a list of titles which included Toland's work in 1760. \n\n\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list (and it does not clearly distinguish pamphlets from books):\n\n"}

Mechanical philosophy is associated with the scientific revolution of Early Modern Europe. One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of \"Leviathan\" by Hobbes published in 1651.\n\nSome intellectual historians and critical theorists argue that early mechanical philosophy was tied to disenchantment and the rejection of the idea of nature as living or animated by spirits or angels. Other scholars, however, have noted that early mechanical philosophers nevertheless believed in magic, Christianity and spiritualism.\n\nSome ancient philosophies held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the motion and collision of matter. This view was closely linked with materialism and reductionism, especially that of the atomists and to a large extent, stoic physics. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution of the 17th century had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of \"mechanical laws\": natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that imply a determinism. If all phenomena can be explained entirely through the motion of matter under physical laws, as the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined, past, present or future.\n\nThe natural philosophers directly concerned with developing the mechanical philosophy were largely a French group, together with some of their personal connections. They included Pierre Gassendi, Marin Mersenne and René Descartes. Also involved were the English thinkers Sir Kenelm Digby, Thomas Hobbes and Walter Charleton; and the Dutch natural philosopher Isaac Beeckman.\n\nRobert Boyle used \"mechanical philosophers\" to refer both to those with a theory of \"corpuscles\" or atoms of matter, such as Gassendi and Descartes, and those who did without such a theory. One common factor was the clockwork universe view. His meaning would be problematic in the cases of Hobbes and Galileo Galilei; it would include Nicolas Lemery and Christiaan Huygens, as well as himself. Newton would be a transitional figure. Contemporary usage of \"mechanical philosophy\" dates back to 1952 and Marie Boas Hall.\n\nIn France the mechanical philosophy spread mostly through private academies and salons; in England in the Royal Society. In England it did not have a large initial impact in universities, which were somewhat more receptive in France, the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nOne of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of \"Leviathan\" (1651) by Hobbes (1651); the book's second chapter invokes the principle of inertia, foundational for the mechanical philosophy. Boyle did not mention him as one of the group; but at the time they were on opposite sides of a controversy. Richard Westfall deems him a mechanical philosopher.\n\nHobbes's major statement of his natural philosophy is in \"De Corpore\" (1655). In part II and III of this work he goes a long way towards identifying fundamental physics with geometry; and he freely mixes concepts from the two areas.\n\nDescartes was also a mechanist. A substance dualist, he argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended matter, on the one hand, and immaterial mind, on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was mechanistic in nature:\n\nHis scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic automata. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.\n\nIsaac Beeckman's theory of mechanical philosophy described in his books \"Centuria\" and \"Journal\" is grounded in two components: matter and motion. To explain matter, Beeckman relied on atomism philosophy which explains that matter is composed of tiny inseparable particles that interact to create the objects seen in life. To explain motion, he supported the idea of inertia, a theory generated by Isaac Newton.\n\nIsaac Newton ushered in a weaker notion of mechanism that tolerated the action at a distance of gravity. Interpretations of Newton's scientific work in light of his occult research have suggested that he did not properly view the universe as mechanistic, but instead populated by mysterious forces and spirits and constantly sustained by God and angels. Later generations of philosophers who were influenced by Newton example were nonetheless often mechanists. Among them were Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Denis Diderot.\n\nThe French mechanist and determinist Pierre Simon de Laplace formulated some implications of the mechanist thesis, writing:\n\n\n"}

The survivors wrote the classics in the contemporary characters of their time, and these texts were later dubbed as \"New Text\". New Text school attained prominence in the Western Han dynasty and became the official interpretation for Confucianism, which was adopted as the official ideology by Emperor Wu of Han. Represented by Confucians such as Dong Zhongshu, this school advocated a holistic interpretation of Confucian classics and viewed Confucius as a charismatic, visionary prophet, a sage who deserved the Mandate of Heaven but did not attain kingship due to circumstances. The school competed with Old Text Confucianism in the later Han dynasty and its dominance waned as the latter became the new orthodoxy. The school fell into obscurity during the chaotic period after the fall of the Han dynasty and remained so until late Ming dynasty in the 17th century.\n\nThe school was reinvigorated by a group of scholars who were dissatisfied with the popular Neo-Confucianism at the time in the late Ming dynasty. The movement gained momentum in eighteenth century with the rise of the Changzhou School of Thought. It became a major intellectual trend in Chinese philology and political ideology. As formulated by B. Elman, it was intended to offer a solution to the crisis of confidence between the Chinese state and its gentry constituency in the transition from the Qianlong era to the Jiaqing era in the Qing dynasty.\n\n\nBy far the most important feature of the New Text Confucianism as political movement was advocating reform (Zhuang Cunyu, Liu Fenglu), drawing from the \"Gongyang\" legalist-style ideology of \"weighing the circumstances\".

Lewis met in 1919 as students at Oxford University and were close friends for 44 years. \"It is no exaggeration to say that his friendship with Barfield was one of the most important in his [Lewis's] life…” The relationship was reciprocated. Almost a year after Lewis's death, Barfield spoke of his friendship in a talk in the USA: \"Now, whatever he was, and as you know, he was a great many things, CS Lewis was for me, first and foremost, the absolutely unforgettable friend, the friend with whom I was in close touch for over 40 years, the friend you might come to regard hardly as another human being, but almost as a part of the furniture of my existence.” When they met, Lewis was an atheist who told Barfield, \"I don’t accept God!\" Barfield was influential in converting Lewis. Lewis developed the concept of two kinds of friends, a first friend with whom you feel at home and agree and a second friend who brings to you a different point of view. He found Barfield's contribution in this way particularly helpful despite, or because of, the fact that “during the 1920s, the two were to engage in a long dispute over Barfield's (and their mutual friend, A.C. Harwood's) connection to anthroposophy and the kind of knowledge that imagination can give us… which they affectionately called 'The Great War'. Through their conversations, Lewis gave up materialist realism – the idea that our sensible world is self-explanatory and is all that there is – and moved closer to what he had always disparagingly referred to as “supernaturalism.” These conversations influenced Lewis towards writing his Narnia series. As well as being friend and teacher to Lewis, Barfield was (professionally) his legal adviser and trustee.\n\nBarfield was an important intellectual influence on Lewis, who dedicated his 1936 book \"Allegory of Love\" to Barfield. Lewis wrote his 1949 book \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", the first Narnia chronicle, for his friend's adopted daughter Lucy Barfield and dedicated it to her. He also dedicated \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" to Barfield's son Geoffrey in 1952. Barfield also influenced his scholarship and world view. He dedicated his first scholarly book, The Allegory of Love (1936) to his 'wisest and best of my unofficial teachers,' stating in its preface that he asked no more than to disseminate Barfield's literary theory and practice. Barfield's more than merely intellectual approach to philosophy and type of influence is illustrated by a well-known interchange that took place between Lewis and Barfield. Lewis one day made the mistake of referring to philosophy as \"a subject.\" \"It wasn't a \"subject\" to Plato,\" said Barfield, \"It was a way.\"., had some influence on Lewis. In the third lecture of The Abolition of Man (1947), Lewis suggests that Barfield's mentor, Rudolf Steiner, may have found the way to a 'redeemed scientific method that does not omit the qualities of the observed object'.\n\nBarfield was also an important influence on Tolkien. In a letter to C.A.Furth of Allen and Unwin in 1937, Tolkien wrote, \"the only philological remark (I think) in The Hobbit is...: an odd mythological way of referring to linguistic philosophy, and a point that will (happily) be missed by any who have not read Barfield (few have), and probably by those who have.\" The reference in question comes when Bilbo visits the dragon Smaug's treasure hoard within the Lonely Mountain:\n\"To say that Bilbo's breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment...\"\n\nLewis wrote to Barfield in around 1928 about his influence on Tolkien: \"You might like to know that when Tolkien dined with me the other night he said, apropos of something quite different, that your conception of the ancient semantic unity had modified his whole outlook, and he was always just going to say something in a lecture when your concept stopped him in time. 'It is one of those things,' he said, 'that when you have once seen it there are all sorts of things you never say again.\"\n\nBarfield's notion of final participation (the idea of a fully conscious participative unity with nature) brought to the Inklings ideas similar to those later expounded by others as Radical Orthodoxy, with its long theological history. It has roots in the Platonic idea of \"methexis\" passed on by Augustine and Aquinas and offered a sacramental view of reality, which Tolkien takes up in the Ring, in for example the contemplative artistry and natural oneness of the elves, Tom Bombadil and the hobbits’ simple pleasures.\n\nBarfield became an anthroposophist after attending a lecture by Rudolf Steiner in 1924. He studied the work and philosophy of Rudolf Steiner throughout his life and translated some of his works, and had some early essays published in anthroposophical publications. This part of Barfield's literary work includes the book \"The Case for Anthroposophy\" containing his Introduction to selected extracts from Steiner's \"Riddles of the Soul\". A study of Steiner's basic texts provides information on some of the ideas that influenced Barfield's work, but Barfield's work ought not be considered derivative of Steiner's. Barfield expert G. B. Tennyson suggests the relation: \"Barfield is to Steiner as Steiner was to Goethe\". But though Barfield's writing was profoundly original and not derivative, he would not have agreed with Tennyson's characterization. Barfield considered Steiner a much greater man and mind than Goethe. From that point of view, Tennyson's analogy implies that Barfield was much greater than Steiner. But Barfield considered himself very small beside Steiner, or Goethe. (Tennyson may have meant the analogy to suggest influence, rather than relative stature.)\n\nBarfield might be characterised as both a Christian writer and a learned anti-reductionist writer. All of his books are in print again in new editions, and include \"Unancestral Voice\"; \"History, Guilt, and Habit\"; \"Romanticism Comes of Age; The Rediscovery of Meaning; Speaker's Meaning;\" and \"Worlds Apart\". \"History in English Words\" seeks to retell the history of Western civilization by exploring the change in meanings of various words. \"Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry\" is on the 1999 \"100 Best Spiritual Books of the Century\" list by Philip Zaleski.\n\nBarfield was also an influence on T. S. Eliot who called Barfield's book \"Worlds Apart\" \"a journey into seas of thought very far from ordinary routes of intellectual shipping.\"\n\nIn her book \"Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien's World\", Verlyn Flieger analyzes the influence of Barfield's \"Poetic Diction\" on the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nMore recent discussions of Barfield's work are published in Stephen Talbott's \"The Future Does Not Compute: Transcending the Machines in Our Midst\", Neil Evernden's \"The Social Creation of Nature\", Daniel Smitherman's \"Philosophy and the Evolution of Consciousness\", Morris Berman's \"The Reenchantment of the World,\" and Gary Lachman's \"A Secret History of Consciousness.\" In 1996 Lachman conducted perhaps the last interview with Barfield, versions of which appeared in \"Gnosis\" magazine and the magazine \"Lapis.\"\n\nIn his book \"Why the World Around You isn't as it Appears: A Study of Owen Barfield\" (SteinerBooks, 2012), Albert Linderman presents Barfield's work in light of recent societal examples and scholarship while writing for an audience less familiar with philosophical categories and history.\n\nIn a foreword to \"Poetic Diction\", Howard Nemerov, US Poet Laureate, stated: \"Among the poets and teachers of my acquaintance who know POETIC DICTION it has been valued not only as a secret book, but nearly as a sacred one.\"\n\nSaul Bellow, the Nobel Prize–winning novelist, wrote: \"We are well supplied with interesting writers, but Owen Barfield is not content to be merely interesting. His ambition is to set us free. Free from what? From the prison we have made for ourselves by our ways of knowing, our limited and false habits of thought, our 'common sense'.\" \n\nThe culture critic and psychologist James Hillman called Barfield \"one of the most neglected important thinkers of the 20th Century\".\n\nHarold Bloom, describing \"Poetic Diction\", referred to it as \"a wonderful book, from which I keep learning a great deal\".\n\nThe film \"Owen Barfield: Man and Meaning\" (1994), co-produced and written by G. B. Tennyson and David Lavery, directed and edited by Ben Levin, is a documentary portrait of Barfield.\n\nBarfield has been held in high esteem by many contemporary poets, including Robert Kelly, Charles Stein, George Quasha, Tom Cheetham, and others.\n\nBarfield's \"Poetic Diction\" opens with examples of \"felt changes\" arising in reading poetry, and discusses how these relate to general principles of poetic composition. But Barfield's greater agenda is \"a study of meaning\". Using poetic examples, he attempts to demonstrate how the imagination works with words and metaphors to create meaning. \nHe shows how the imagination of the poet creates new meaning, and how this same process has been active, throughout human experience, to create and continuously expand language. For Barfield this is not just literary criticism: \nit is evidence for the evolution of human consciousness. This, for many readers, is his real accomplishment: his unique presentation of \"not merely a theory of poetic diction, but a theory of poetry, and not merely a theory of poetry, but a theory of knowledge\". This theory was developed directly from a close study of the evolution of words and meaning, starting with the relation between the primitive mind's myth making capacity, and the formation of words. Barfield uses numerous examples to demonstrate that words originally had a unified \"concrete and undivided\" meaning, which we now distinguish as several distinct concepts. \nFor example, the single Greek word \"pneuma\" (which can be variously translated as \"breath\", \"spirit\", or \"wind\") reflects, Barfield argues, the primordial unity of these concepts of air, spirit, wind, and breath, all included in one \"holophrase\". This Barfield considers not the application of analogy to natural phenomena, but the discernment of its pre-existence. This is the perspective Barfield believes is original in the evolution of consciousness, which was \"fighting for its life\", as he phrases it, in the philosophy of Plato, and which, in a regenerate and more sophisticated form, benefiting from the development of rational thought, needs to be recovered if consciousness is to continue to evolve.\n\nBarfield's \"Worlds Apart\" is one of his most important books. It is a fictional dialogue between a physicist, a biologist, a psychiatrist, a lawyer-philologist, a linguistic analyst, a theologian, a retired Waldorf School teacher, and a young man employed at a rocket research station. During a period of three days, the characters discuss and debate first principles.\n\n\"Saving the Appearances\" explores some three thousand years of history—particularly the history of human consciousness. Barfield argues that the evolution of nature is inseparable from the evolution of consciousness. What we call matter interacts with mind and wouldn't exist without it. In Barfield's lexicon, there is an \"unrepresented\" underlying base of reality that is extra-mental. This is comparable to Kant's notion of the \"noumenal world\". However, unlike Kant, Barfield entertained the idea that the \"unrepresented\" could be directly experienced, under some conditions.\n\nSimilar conclusions have been made by others, and the book has influenced, for example, the physicist Stephen Edelglass (who wrote \"The Marriage of Sense and Thought\"), and the Christian existentialist philosopher Gabriel Marcel, who wanted the book to be translated into French.\n\nBarfield points out that the \"real\" world of physics and particles is completely different from the world we see and live in of things with properties. The particle world of physics is independent of human thought, and only indirectly accessible to humans. The world we see and perceive directly is dependent on and alterable by human thought (this is not to say there aren't or are limits.) Both are 'real' or 'unreal' depending on the meaning of real; that this changes over time in human thought is exactly Barfield's point.\n\nFor a full bibliography including all essays, see Hipolito, \"Bibliography of the published Writings of Owen Barfield\" in sources section below. \n\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated by humanists, learning Greek and Latin, and establishing an important collection of rare books. Vespasiano, in his \"Lives of illustrious men of the 15th century\" described him as rich, handsome, a family man, a scholar, and a great builder and collector. Palla Strozzi was the richest man in Florence with a gross taxable assets of 162,925 florins in 1427, including 54 farms, 30 houses, a banking firm with a capital of 45,000 florins, and communal bonds. Despite his abundant wealth, Strozzi lived well beyond his means and had little interest in his family’s banking business, which would help lead to his eventual economic and political downfall in the later half of the 15th century.\n\nIn his sixties, together with Rinaldo degli Albizzi, he became the leader of the opposition against Cosimo de' Medici, the man who practically controlled the political power in Florence. Initially successful, the two secured the imprisonment of Cosimo, forcing him into exile in 1433. However, when Cosimo returned, both the Strozzi and Albizzi families were exiled in turn. In 1434, Strozzi moved to Padua, where he started to plan a return to his native city.

{"id": "47564660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47564660", "title": "Petre P. Negulescu", "text": "Petre P. Negulescu\n\nPetre Paul Negulescu (October 18, 1870 – September 28, 1951) was a Romanian philosopher and conservative politician, known as a disciple and continuator of Titu Maiorescu. Affiliated with Maiorescu's \"Junimea\" society from his early twenties, he debuted as a positivist and monist, attempting to reconcile art for art's sake with an evolutionist philosophy of culture. He was a lecturer and tenured professor at the University of Iași, where he promoted the \"Junimist\" lobby against left-wing competitors, and formalized his links with the Conservative Party in 1901. From 1910, he taught at the University of Bucharest, publishing works on Renaissance philosophy and other historical retrospectives.\n\nAfter World War I, Negulescu was an affiliate (later president) of the radical-conservative People's Party, and an advocate of labor and education reform. Serving several terms in Parliament, he was twice the Public Education Minister in the 1920s, but failed to enact his project for vocational-centered schooling.\n\nBy 1934, as an adversary of the nationalist far-right, he wrote tracts rejecting biological determinism of all sorts, and scientific racism in particular. Pushed in the minority by supporters of statism, Negulescu supported meritocracy within the framework of classical liberalism. He was sidelined by right-wing totalitarian regimes after 1940, and ultimately banned, shortly before his death, by the communist regime.\n\nPetre Negulescu is widely believed to have been born in Ploiești in October 1872. However, his early papers give his birth date as October 18, 1870, a date he probably concealed and replaced for vanity reasons. As a youth, he attended Saints Peter and Paul High School in his native city, and subsequently enrolled in the sciences faculty of the University of Bucharest, being especially interested in mathematics. After hearing several lectures on the history of philosophy delivered by Titu Maiorescu, he transferred to the literature and philosophy faculty, graduating in 1892. In March 1891, by that time a student of Maiorescu's, he began attending meetings of \"Junimea\" literary society, where he met Simion Mehedinți and Mihail Dragomirescu.\n\nFrom his student days, Negulescu supported the patriotic activism of Romanians in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania. In 1890, together with Mehedinți, he edited \"Memoriul studenților universitari români privitor la situația românilor din Transilvania și Ungaria\" (\"A Memorandum of Romanian University Students Regarding the Situation of Romanians in Transylvania and Hungary\"), a document that also appeared in French and was meant to draw European public attention to the Magyarization policy of the Budapest government. He belonged to the leadership committee of the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, founded in Bucharest the same year.\n\nEncouraged by his mentor, he completed his theoretical preparation at the universities of Berlin, Leipzig and Paris. He became an associate professor in 1894, aged 22, in the history of modern philosophy and logic department of the University of Iași. Both Negulescu and Teohari Antonescu, the archaeologist, were moved there in a bid to ensure \"Junimea\" control over the university, and to consolidate the conservative circles of Iași, against a rising tide of socialist influence. Although he found the city \"repulsive\" and a \"place of exile\", Negulescu accepted his appointment as a political and cultural mission. He was soon disappointed by the local \"Junimea\" branch and its president, N. Volenti, asking Maiorescu to send them better cultural material. In these early years, Negulescu was heavily indebted to Maiorescu's influence, down to oratory: he was known (and ridiculed) for copying Maiorescu's speech mannerisms. Also like Maiorescu, he was an atheist and a positivist, who read religion in functionalist terms.\n\nNegulescu's publishing debut came in 1892, with a metaphysical essay, \"Critica apriorismului și a empirismului\" (\"A Critique of Apriorism and Empiricism\"), earning him the Romanian Academy award in philosophy. The title indicates the two main philosophical currents rejected by Negulescu, who sought a middle road between transcendental idealism and resurgent anti-realism, finalism, and theism. He found it in \"realistic empiricism\", a brand of monism, evolutionism and scientism that quoted heavily from Herbert Spencer. His monistic outlook fell short of classical positivism and historical materialism, since it rehabilitated metaphysical inquiry as a legitimate pursuit. Various authors have regretfully noted that Negulescu never truly developed his tentative metaphysical system, which appeared to them inconclusive.\n\nNegulescu followed up with works of aesthetics, including: \"Psihologia stilului\" (\"The Psychology of Style\", 1892), \"Impersonalitatea și morala în artă\" (\"Impersonality and Morality in Art\", 1893), \"Religiunea și arta\" (\"Religion and Art\", 1894), \"Socialismul și arta\" (\"Socialism and Art\", 1895). Later, he published works of applied philosophy: \"Filosofia în viața practică\" (\"Philosophy in Practical Life\", 1896), and \"Rolul ideilor în progresul social\" (\"The Role of Ideas in Social Progress\", 1900). The latter works, of which \"Psihologia stilului\" was serialized in Maiorescu's \"Convorbiri Literare\" journal, were also attacks against the socialist literary critic, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who had tackled \"Junimea\"s art for art's sake ideology with calls for didacticism.\n\nDragomirescu and Negulescu remained the only two Maiorescu disciples who carried on his work in pure aesthetics; others, such as Alexandru Philippide and Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, began as aestheticists, but later veered into more applied science. According to historian Z. Ornea, Negulescu stood further apart from Maiorescu not just because he questioned the more detailed aspects of his agenda, but also because he was a moderate, whereas Dragomirescu was a man of \"rigid convictions\" and \"systematic dogmatism\".\n\nHis polemic with the socialists, inaugurated in \"Psihologia stilului\", was largely tributary to the theories of Spencer, Frédéric Paulhan, and Jean-Marie Guyau, trying to show that \"Junimism\" was more in tune with modern literary criticism. The implicit target was Dobrogeanu-Gherea, depicted by Negulescu as a pale imitator of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and his \"social destination\" of art. However, with \"Religiunea și arta\", Negulescu went beyond Maiorescu's theories, and closer to Dobrogeanu-Gherea's, proposing that poetic art was not just a luxury of advanced societies, but also a functional entity that contributed to social progress. He also proposed interpreting style and tastefulness as variables emerging from objective psychological criteria, such as the \"economy of attention\" and \"nervous excitement\". On this basis, he proposed a general hierarchy of art by appeal and subject matter, ranking old Egyptian murals below Italian Renaissance painting, but above the minor art of medieval goldsmiths. He believed that art and religion served similar purposes in stirring up vital emotions, and amended the art for art's sake theory with his ideas on \"impersonality\", implying objectivity for the artist, but also a subjective, self-absorbed, relevancy for his artistic creation.\n\nNegulescu spent those years traveling extensively in Europe, cementing his friendship with Maiorescu and with fellow \"Junimists\". In 1894, he and Dumitru Evolceanu were in Gräfenberg, where the latter was curing his \"sexual neurasthenia\". It was in that context that Negulescu discovered and promoted Evolceanu as a storyteller, the literary hope of \"Junimea\". Later, Maiorescu took Negulescu along on vacations to Abbázia. In Romania and abroad, Negulescu spent much time with Antonescu, who left notes about Negulescu's eccentric habits, including his asceticism, complete sexual abstinence, and social awkwardness.\n\nIn 1894, Maiorescu wrote confidently that the stage now belonged to \"the second-generation \"Junimea\"\", comprising Negulescu, Evolceanu, Antonescu, and Dragomirescu. While preparing for print \"Religiunea și arta\", Negulescu found himself caught in a conflict with Nicolae Basilescu and other non-orthodox \"Junimists\", who rejected his theories from a historicist perspective. In resisting Basilescu, he reaffirmed his purist reading of Maiorescu's credo, namely that \"truth\" was the universal artistic criterion, and formal perfection an objective trait. He restated these tenets in an extended polemic with the anti-\"Junimist\" ideologue N. Petrașcu, the bulk of which became a standalone essay, \"Lucruri vechi\" (\"Old Things\", 1898). However, by then, he himself had embraced some of Basilescu's historicist views about art as an expression of civilization, trying to bring them into agreement with arguments picked up from Hippolyte Taine. Negulescu still argued that subjectivity was the main driver of cultural accomplishment, citing extreme (and, according to Ornea, flawed) examples of artists and intellectuals who withstood all immersion in contemporary life, from Galilei to Ingres.\n\nNegulescu rose to full professor in 1896, in spite of not having a doctorate; he benefited from Maiorescu's influence and intrigues. Maiorescu preferred him over Rădulescu-Motru, who had parted with mainline \"Junimism\". Counteracting the anti-\"Junimists\", Negulescu and Antonescu gave full support to Dragomirescu, when the latter presented his candidature for a professorship in Bucharest. Meanwhile, Negulescu had a personal conflict with philologist Ilie Bărbulescu, intervening to have him denied employment at Iași. His teaching and research were supplemented by articles he wrote for various magazines, including \"Convorbiri Literare\" (of which he became an editor in 1895), \"Arhiva Societății Științifice și Literare\", and \"Revista Română Politică și Literară\". The latter review was largely under his control, and marked his distancing from the Cultural League, publishing critical articles by Ovid Densusianu.\n\nAccording to biographer Eugen Lovinescu, Negulescu was a monotonous intellectual, among the handful of students who lived up to Maiorescu's demand for \"absolute fidelity\" and \"moral servitude\". Eventually, Maiorescu even persuaded his pupil to consider marrying into a better-off family, and to renounce his \"sickly romanticism\". For a while in 1898, he was engaged to Mariette Dabija, the owner of a large country estate. Abandoning such plans, Negulescu remained a recluse and \"pedantic\" teetotaler, also noted for his aversion to smoking.\n\nNegulescu entered politics in 1901, as a member of Maiorescu's Conservative Party. He was seen by Maiorescu as a good minister in training, but, in his own account, he only rallied because his teacher had asked him to; overall, he resented political life and disliked the political class. In effect, he followed the \"Junimist\" or \"constitutionalist\" inner-Conservative faction, which was quasi-independent from the main party. The year 1902 also marked his split with the Cultural League, after the latter no longer invited him and other \"Junimea\" men to attend its congresses.\n\nAccording to a note by their former student Ioan Lupu, before 1910 Antonescu and Negulescu were the most popular professors at Iași, their courses attended by more people than the halls could fit. In December 1910, upon Maiorescu's retirement, Negulescu was finally transferred to the history and encyclopedia of philosophy department at Bucharest; his professorship in Iași was assigned in 1915 to another \"Junimea\" favorite, Ion Petrovici. In Bucharest, his assistant was a docent, Mircea Florian, for whom Negulescu created a lecture-master's position in 1924. Negulescu became Florian's friend and godfather, but blocked his academic advancement, refusing to award him a full professorship. Reportedly, this was because he feared that Petrovici, whom he deeply resented, would use the opportunity and place a claim on a Bucharest chair.\n\nNegulescu returned to philosophy with a two volumes of \"Filosofia Renașterii\" (\"Renaissance Philosophy\"), respectively published in 1910 and 1914. He continued to maneuver in support of \"Junimea\" favorites, working to find Mihai Ralea a professor's chair in Iași, and supporting Dimitrie Gusti, Vasile Pârvan and Ion A. Rădulescu-Pogoneanu when they placed similar bids in Bucharest. He also tried (and failed) to rebuild trust between Maiorescu and the former \"Junimist\" playwright Ion Luca Caragiale. During that stage of his career, Negulescu exercised his influence on a new generation of philosophers, including Eugeniu Sperantia, Camil Petrescu, and Tudor Vianu. Petrescu was reportedly his favorite, considered an intellectual equal. Although better known as a novelist, Petrescu always credited Negulescu as an influence on his own work in philosophy and political theory.\n\nNegulescu was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1915. A year later, Romania entered World War I, and suffered a German invasion. Negulescu fled occupied Bucharest, and in early 1917, took refuge in the Russian Republic, at Odessa. It was there that he came up with the idea of creating a new party \"of National Renaissance\", to challenge both the dominant National Liberal Party (PNL) and the pro-German Conservatives, and to promote a functional electoral democracy. Over the following months, he co-opted members of the old establishment: the \"Junimist\" Gusti, the Conservative Constantin Argetoianu, and the PNL's Constantin Angelescu.\n\nIn April 1918, he entered the Alexandru Averescu-led People's League upon its establishment in Iași; in 1920, this would become the People's Party (PP), for a while the main opposition force to the PNL. Its mission, according to Negulescu, was to give legal expression to the revolutionary anti-PNL grievances. In November 1918, right after the Armistice with Germany and at the height of European revolutions, Negulescu's Bucharest home hosted negotiations between the radicalized PP and the Socialist Party of Romania (PS), during which it was proposed to turn Romania into a republic, in exchange for socialist participation in government.\n\nEarly in 1919, Negulescu presided over a Bucharest faculty of philosophy \"review commission\", tasked with investigating colleagues accused of having collaborated with the occupation authorities—such cases included Florian, Rădulescu-Motru, and Rădulescu-Pogoneanu. Negulescu was unenthusiastic about this assignment, and the investigations were cut short when he fell ill (or feigned illness), then resigned. This was the era of Transylvania's union with Romania, which Negulescu fully endorsed, signing at least one petition addressed to the Paris Peace Conference, pleading for the union's recognition.\n\nNegulescu continued to take up anti-establishment causes, and, against Argetoianu's advice, convinced the People's League to abstain in protest from participating in the November 1919 election. Although the negotiations of 1918 had failed, Negulescu supported a rapprochement with the PS. After the latter's leadership was arrested for its role in the general strike of 1920, he appeared as a defense witness, arguing that striking was a legitimate tool within capitalist competition.\n\nElected to the Senate in 1920, he won a seat in the Assembly of Deputies in 1926. After successfully competing with Petrovici for the position, he was twice Public Education Minister under Averescu: March–December 1921 and March–June 1926. His first term saw tensions inside the PP: Negulescu claimed to have exposed embezzlement by his Transylvanian subordinate, Ioan Lupaș, but that such finds were covered by up on Averescu's order.\n\nDuring his first term, Negulescu tried to implement a law on reforming education in Romania, that would undercut the PNL's project. However, as noted at the time by Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, \"everything stood in his way\". Writing at the time, social theorist Ștefan Zeletin suggested that Negulescu's plan was daring and innovative, if heavily indebted to Germanic models and not fully responsive to actual social needs. Concluding that intellectualism had failed, Negulescu favored an 11-year pre-university education, with the introduction of unitary vocational education, the upgrading of normal schools, and the development of secondary education around \"citizen schools\". Another part of his program, on which he could agree with the PNL shadow minister, Angelescu, was the Romanianization of Transylvanian schools, particularly those catering to Hungarians, and the secularization of faith schools. Negulescu wrote that he considered the measure imperative, because of the schools' alleged role in spreading Hungarian irredentism. However, he was lenient toward expressions of Hungarian resentment, vetoing a government clampdown on Hungarian nationalist protesters, and speaking out in Senate in favor of political tolerance; he suggested that Hungarians had reason to view the Treaty of Trianon as a collective shock.\n\nHis party was ousted from power before he could enact the reform, and Angelescu overturned his conservative policies. His second term cut short by the political power shifts, Negulescu was appointed President of the Assembly, serving from July 1926, when Petrovici took over as Education Minister, and being reelected on November 14, before ultimately stepping down in June 1927. This period was one of political uncertainty: Negulescu's term coincided with revelations that King Ferdinand I was terminally ill with cancer, which renewed calls for a national unity government. His time in office also saw the adoption of labor legislation in April 1927. He remained a vocal critic of Angelescu, noting the \"dizzying\" and \"chaotic\" opening of new schools under his mandate, arguing that the whole effort was low-quality and therefore deceptive.\n\nOver those years, Negulescu focused his research on the history of philosophy, as well as one practical and political issues. As noted by Traian Herseni, this new interest was \"related\", albeit not in fact identical, to the sociology of culture. Such works include: \"Reforma învățământului\" (\"Education Reform\", 1922), \"Partidele politice\" (\"The Political Parties\", 1926), \"Geneza formelor culturii\" (\"The Genesis of Cultural Forms\", 1934), \"Academia platonică din Florența\" (\"The Platonic Academy in Florence\", 1936), \"Nicolaus Cusanus\" (1937) and \"Destinul Omenirii\" (\"The Destiny of Mankind\", Vol. I, 1938; Vol. II, 1939). With his new work in aesthetics, Negulescu expanded his system into psychological determinism, from personality types; he also proposed that art history was a continuous dialogue between \"critical analysis\" and \"imagination\", which succeeded and tempered each other. Scholar Dan Grigorescu views \"Geneza formelor culturii\" as Negulescu's masterpiece, but notes that its system of references, comprising Georges Dumas, Joseph Jastrow, Ernst Kretschmer, Theodor Lipps and Paulin Malapert, was quickly outdated. At core, Grigorescu proposes, \"Geneza\" was a Renaissance idea, but also similar to contemporary musings by Albert Einstein and Leslie White.\n\nAt the university, Negulescu held a series of courses that were later also published: \"Enciclopedia filosofiei\" (\"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", 1924–1926), \"Istoria filosofiei. Pozitivismul francez contemporan\" (\"A History of Philosophy. Contemporary French Positivism\", 1924–1925), \"Problema ontologică\" (\"The Ontological Issue\", 1927–1928), \"Problema epistemologiei\" (\"The Epistemological Issue\", 1930–1932) and \"Enciclopedia filosofiei. Problema cosmologică\" (\"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Cosmological Issue\", 1935–1937). His work was carried in interwar newspapers and magazines, primarily the PP's \"Îndreptarea\", \"Ideea Europeană\", and \"Revista de Filosofie\".\n\nNegulescu advanced to the rank of titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1936. By then, he was an increasingly isolated critic of the prevailing cultural and political tendencies. Against the protectionism favored by the intellectual class, who felt threatened by the Great Depression, he developed a meritocratic and classically liberal scheme, outlined in \"Destinul Omenirii\". He suggested that intellectuals were clients of the state, who expected secure jobs in the bureaucracy, but who took no personal responsibility for their fate; he favored deregulation and saw the crisis as an opportunity for advancement. Such ideas were expressly rejected by the young right-wing radicals Mircea Eliade and Mihail Polihroniade, who noted that, in his day, Negulescu had had an irreplicable chance at social advancement. Criticism also came in from the left: the communist philosopher Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu argued that \"Destinul Omenirii\" was no longer in keeping with Negulescu's earlier materialistic monism, but \"finalistic\" and borderline \"mystical\".\n\n\"Geneza formelor culturii\", which sought to discover the natural preconditions of individual philosophical stances, was primarily a critique of popular biological determinism, including degeneration theory and psychoanalytic theory. To these, he opposed a combination of functionalism, mutationism, and environmental determinism. In \"Geneza\", but also in his public pronouncements, Negulescu stood out as a vocal antifascist and a critic of scientific racism. He had a polemic with the staff of the far-right \"Gândirea\", arguing against them that neither biology, nor the Romanian Orthodox ethos, made for concrete realities in grounding national identity and a \"national philosophy\"; in his view, \"nation\" was a social construct with no biological basis. Moreover, Negulescu separated \"peaceful and productive\" liberal nationalism from its ethnic counterpart. Implicitly and explicitly, Negulescu also took a stand against the radically fascist and antisemitic Iron Guard.\n\nHis work upheld the notion that miscegenation was inescapable and observable in Romanian ethnogenesis, and expressed skepticism toward racial serology studies, taken up locally by Sabin Manuilă. Such observations may have contributed to curbing the influence of Nazi racialism on Romanian eugenicists such as Ovidiu Comșia. However, Nichifor Crainic of \"Gândirea\" restated the racialist argument in 1934, in a brochure which referred to Negulescu as an \"old philosopher shaped by the ideological school of the bygone century\".\n\nAlthough celebrated at an official level, Negulescu was losing the respect of his students, who visited him in his salon and heard him speak for hours. One of them, the diarist Jeni Acterian, complained that the Negulescu home was \"sinister\". The professor himself, she argued, was \"smart\" but \"dry to the bone\", his voice \"raucous and monotonous\". By his own standards, Negulescu insisted that a professor's job was not primarily about transmitting information, but about \"advancing the science.\" Also a student of his, Eliade recalled him as an \"honest\" man of great \"self-discipline\", but generally \"colorless\". The target of his jibes against metaphysics, he argued that Negulescu's scientism was most of all shaped by popular science. They quarreled most bitterly about Eliade's study of Indian philosophy, which Negulescu refused to allow in his university.\n\nWhile speaking out against fascism, Negulescu was also critical of the authoritarian King Carol II who, from 1934, used the state of emergency against both the Iron Guard and liberal democrats. In March 1935, alongside envoys from other groups, he participated in negotiations with Grigore Filipescu's new Conservative Party, seeking a common platform against censorship and repression. Shortly before the start of World War II, Negulescu and Filipescu's political vision was defeated by the rise of successive fascist regimes. The first of these was the National Renaissance Front (FRN), established by Carol. As noted by scholar Maria Bucur, it formalized the clientele system that Negulescu had spoken out against. In February 1938, Averescu resigned the PP presidency and joined the king's supporters; Negulescu replaced him as the head of the moribund party, which survived until the authoritarian constitution came into force later that year, and possibly dissolved itself voluntarily.\n\nIn 1940, aged 70, Negulescu was forced to retire by the Iron Guard's National Legionary State regime, the onset of a political purge. Partly recovered by the regime of Ion Antonescu, in March 1941 he worked with Gusti, Mihai Ciucă, Radu R. Rosetti, and Liviu Rebreanu on an Academy reform project. It called for increased national propaganda in the Romanian rump state, to compensate for the losses of Bessarabia and Northern Transylvania during the previous year. His inaugural speech at the Academy, held that May, dealt with generational conflict and the factor of progress. In 1942, during Petrovici's term as Education Minister, Vasile Netea of \"Vremea\" magazine interviewed him on the topic of education policies.\n\nNegulescu had a brief return to cultural prominence in 1945, during a democratic interlude that came after the fall of Antonescu. His political stances were probed by Ion Biberi, in an interview that was published in \"Democrația\" weekly. In June 1948, the new communist regime stripped him of membership in the Academy. In his late years, he was persecuted and branded a \"decadent\" philosopher by the official ideologist, Constantin Ionescu Gulian.\n\nNegulescu died in obscurity, aged 80, and was buried in Plot 92 of Bellu cemetery. In the 1960s, communist censorship of his work became more lenient, and, by 1979, he was effectively rehabilitated. From 1969 to 1977, volumes of his unpublished works (including university lectures) were put out by the Academy, under the care of Al. Posescu and N. Gogoneață.\n\n"}
{"id": "592450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=592450", "title": "Pierre-Simon Ballanche", "text": "Pierre-Simon Ballanche\n\nPierre-Simon Ballanche (4 August 1776 – 12 June 1847) was a French writer and counterrevolutionary philosopher, who elaborated a theology of progress that possessed considerable influence in French literary circles in the beginning of the nineteenth century. He was the ninth member elected to occupy seat 4 of the Académie française in 1842.\n\nBorn in Lyon, Ballanche was seventeen when his imagination was marked for life by the horrors of the French Revolution. In 1793, the city's royalist revolt against the authority of the revolutionary Convention ended with guillotining or summary execution of about 700 people. This, and an unhappy love affair early in life, left him with an abidingly tragic view of life as sanctified suffering, a view that he embodied in his works, of which the best known was an unfinished multi-part work entitled \"Essais de palingénésie sociale\" (\"Essays on Social Palingenesis\"). \"Palingenesis\" was a term by which Ballanche referred to the successive regenerations of the society, and he incorporated a progressive vision of Christianity in his work even as he insisted reverently that Christianity was forever immutable.\n\nBallanche first earned his living as a printer. His first published work was \"Du sentiment considéré dans son rapport avec la littérature\" (1802), a work in the vein of Chateaubriand's recently published \"Génie du christianisme\". He made the acquaintance of Julie Récamier in 1812, and moved to Paris shortly thereafter, where he attended regularly her salon at l'Abbaye-aux-Bois.\n\nIn works like \"Antigone\" (1814), \"Essais sur les institutions sociales\" (\"Essay on Social Institutions\", 1818), \"Le Vieillard et le jeune homme\" (\"The Old Man and the Youth\", 1819), \"L'Homme sans nom\" (\"The Man without a Name\", 1820) and \"Élégie\" (\"Elegy\", 1820), he developed the idea that the French Revolution was endowed with a divine significance. Such a view was common enough in counterrevolutionary circles. But unlike religious thinkers who conferred upon the Church the task of interpreting this significance, Ballanche developed a theory of language. In Ballanche's view, to name something was in some way to participate in creation. For Ballanche, this creative power of speech had the same essence as poetry, and he developed a poetics of the symbol that played a role in the thinking of those who gave birth to a new vision of the poet and of poetry that soon came to be known as romanticism.\n\nBallanche's life work, never finished, is generally known as \"Palingénésie\". The idea of this \"great work\" germinated in him in the 1820s, and he announced what was intended to be a vast philosophico-poetic epic of the past, present and future in its opening volume, \"Prolégomènes\", published in 1827. There he described his ambition to write \"the true history of the human race\". The first volume dealt with Greece in \"Orphée\" (\"Orpheus\", 1829), and the second, never finished, with the Roman Republic in \"Formule générale de l'histoire de tous les peuples appliquée à l'histoire du peuple romain\" (\"General Formula of the History of All Peoples Applied to the History of the Roman People\"), fragments of which were published in reviews from 1829 to 1834. The third and final volume, which was never finished, was first announced to be \"La Ville des expiations\" (\"The City of Expiations\"), though Ballanche published \"La Vision d'Hébal\" (\"Hébal's Vision\", 1831). Because Ballanche's thought continued to develop in the 1830s and 1840s he changed plans for the work many times, and the history of his works is enormously complicated and confusing.\n\nIn a sense, this was because of Ballanche's awareness of the difficulty of the task he had set himself. He never worked out his system to his own satisfaction. The turbulence of nineteenth-century French history constantly gave him new food for thought. It is possible, however, to sketch the elements of his fundamental vision.\n\nBallanche's highly original system was a working out of the notion of \"progress through ordeals\". In a sense, his thought is a secular version of Fall and Redemption, adapted to a theological progressivism – an \"optimistic theory of original sin and its consequences\", in the words of Paul Bénichou, who has written extensively on Ballanche's historical importance in \"Le Sacre de l'écrivain\" (1973), \"Le Temps des prophètes\" (1977) and \"Le Grand Œuvre de Ballanche\", \"Revue d'histoire littéraire de la France\" (Sept.-Oct. 1975), collected in \"Variétés critiques\" (1996).\n\nFor Ballanche, a particular form of political authority – Louis XVI, for example – could be doomed to fall without being contemptible. The historical vision that he was developing, and which he expressed in a symbolic language that many found difficult, was one in which a past epoch could possess its own rightness and legitimacy, even as it had lost the right to continue.\n\nBallanche compared himself to Janus, the two-headed god of mythology, because he looked simultaneously in two different directions. His tragic view of history embraced change, while regarding the means by which it was accomplished as the source of an endless need for future expiation.\n\nBallanche occupied – and continues to occupy – an uneasy borderland between progressive and counterrevolutionary camps. He dreamed of himself, timidly, as the one who could reconcile them. But this was not to be: his view of the social order as supernatural in character was not intelligible (or not acceptable) to those on the left, and his willingness to acknowledge the legitimacy of radical change did not endear him to those on the right.\n"}
{"id": "1846440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846440", "title": "Politics of the Joseon dynasty", "text": "Politics of the Joseon dynasty\n\nThe politics of the Joseon Dynasty, which ruled Korea from 1392 to 1897, were governed by the reigning ideology of Korean Confucianism, a form of Neo-Confucianism. Political struggles were common between different factions of the scholar-officials. Purges frequently resulted in leading political figures being sent into exile or condemned to death.\n\nThe political system of this period was dominated by a Confucianist bureaucracy. The government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from senior first rank (jeong-il-pum, Hangul: 정1품, Hanja: 正一品) down to junior ninth rank (jong-gu-pum, 종9품, 從九品) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examinations and recommendations.\n\nThe power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until the 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual.\n\nThe king ruled for life, unlike any of his appointees. The kings of Joseon were all of the Jeonju Yi clan and notionally descended from Taejo, although some were adopted. For a list of Joseon kings, see List of Korean monarchs. Under Confucian philosophy, the king commanded absolute loyalty from his officials and subjects, but the officials were also expected to try to guide the king to the right path if the latter was mistaken. The natural disasters were thought to be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences.\n\nIn order to serve in the positions of responsibility outside the military in Joseon Dynasty, one had to take a series of gwageo literary examinations and pass each of them (usually four to five times). Theoretically, any male other than cheonmin (lowest class) and children of concubines could take gwageo examinations to enter a civil service and thus become yangban (nobility class). In actuality, only yangban class had the luxury of time and money as well as necessary connections to pass gwageo exams. In addition, people from the troublesome northern provinces of Hamgyeong and Pyeongan were barred from office for much of the dynasty.\n\nOfficials served in positions for fixed terms, varying from one year to five years. A successful official might serve in tens of positions in the course of a career.\n\nState Council (Uijeongbu, Hangul: 의정부, Hanja: 議政府) was the highest deliberative body of the Joseon Dynasty although it faded in importance after first centuries of rule. It was composed of twelve officials. The Chief State Councillor (Yeonguijeong, 영의정, 領議政), Left State Councillor (Jwauijeong, 좌의정), and Right State Councillor (Uuijeong, 우의정) were the highest-ranking officials in the government (senior first rank). They were assisted by Left Minister (Jwachanseong, 좌찬성) and Right Minister (Uichangseong, 우찬성), both of junior first rank, and seven lower ranking officials. The power of State Council was inversely proportional to the king's power. Sometimes it directly controlled Six Ministries, the chief executive body of Joseon government, but primarily served in advisory role under stronger kings. State councillors served in several other positions including a tutor to the crown prince.\n\nThe Six Ministries (Yukjo, Hangul: 육조, Hanja: 六曹) were the chief executive body of Joseon. Each Minister (Panseo, 판서) was of senior second rank (2a, third highest rank) and was assisted by a Deputy-Minister (Champan, 참판) of junior second rank (2b, fourth highest rank) and a Secretary (Chamui, 참의) of rank 3a. Apart from these three Dangsanggwan (당상관, 堂上官) officials, each Ministry was headed by three Jeongrang (정랑, rank 5a) and three Jwarang (좌랑, rank 6a), adding to nine officials ranked 6a or above.\n\n\nThree Offices (Samsa, Hangul: 삼사, Hanja: 三司) is a collective name for three offices that provided checks and balance on the king and the officials. The officials who served in these offices tended to be younger and of lower rank compared to other offices but enjoyed special privileges and prestige. They went through more thorough review of moral character and family background. \n\nThe Samsa provided a key check on the powers of the other branches of government. The Inspector-General and Censor-General had the unique power to vet potential appointees for all positions, and examine their family backgrounds. They thus played a role in maintaining the integrity of the yangban aristocracy.\n\n\nThe ranked officials were sent from the central government. Sometimes a secret royal inspector (Amhaeng-eosa, 암행어사) was sent to travel incognito and monitor the provincial officials. Secret inspectors were generally young officials of lower rank but invested with royal authority to dismiss corrupt officials.\n\n\nEach county and hyeon was overseen by a local magistrate appointed by the central government. The yangban of each county (\"gun\") composed a Local Office. This interacted with local officials, typically of a lower class, who were known as \"hyangni\". The \"hyangni\" typically served for life in hereditary posts. The \"hyangni\" of each county had an ambassador in the capital who was charged with communicating among them and the central government .\n\nThroughout the dynasty, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance in the political system. In the earliest years of Joseon, tension between the capital faction and the Yeongnam-based Sarim faction dominated national politics. The different Seowon across the country, which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elite. In the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the Easterners (\"Dongin\") and Westerners (\"Seoin\"), and within decades the Easterners eventually split into the Northerners (\"Bukin\") and the more moderate Southerners (\"Namin\") In the seventeenth century, the Westerners too divided into the Patriarchs (\"Noron\") and the Disciples (\"Soron\").\n\nUnder the reigns of Yeongjo and Jeongjo in the 18th century, the kings generally pursued the *tangpyeongchaek*, a policy of balance favoring no faction over another. In Jeongjo's reign, strife emerged between the Intransigents (\"Byeokpa\") and the Expedients (\"Shipa\"), two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning certain royal policies; the Intransigents were more opposed to the king and largely composed of Patriarchs. In the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families (called \"cheokga\") rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong Kim clan was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang Cho clan.\n\nDuring the reign of Gojong, real power initially belonged to his father the Heungseon Daewongun, who on one hand sought to reform corrupt state institutions but on the other hand pursued a policy of isolationism, opposing the opening of the country to Western and Japanese influences. From the 1870s onwards, Queen Min (known posthumously as Empress Myeongseong) became more dominant and pursued a policy of cautious modernisation and opening up. Her dominance was opposed by reactionaries and progressives alike. The Enlightenment Party (also known as Progressives) sought to modernise the country along Western and Japanese lines. Even amongst the modernisers factions emerged, with one faction favouring the Russian Empire and a second favouring the Japanese Empire, initially the influence of the Russians was strongest but waned with their defeat to Japan in the Russo-Japanese War. These factional struggles led to the Imo Incident and Gapsin Coup, as well as increased foreign interference in Korean affairs.\n\nPurges in Joseon Dynasty were often violent, leading to the execution and internal exile of many members of the losing side. In some cases, even the graves of their ancestors were desecrated. Purges were especially widespread during Sukjong's reign, when there was change of faction in power four times, each time accompanied by cycle of revenge for earlier wrongdoings.\n\nThe most famous rebellions took place in the 19th century, as the social system of Joseon was beginning to collapse: the rebellion of Hong Gyeong-nae in the northern provinces in 1811, the Imo Incident of 1882, and the Donghak uprising of 1894–1895.\n\nOccasional rebellions also took place among the country's small ethnic minorities. The Tungusic tribes of the northeast rose in 1583 under Nitanggae and seized a number of towns; they were put down by the general Shin Rip. Thereafter markets were established in the region to help supply the tribesmen with needed goods. In 1510, Japanese merchants and settlers had risen in rebellion against a local commander; this was followed by the expulsion of all Japanese and the closure of the ports for two years. After the Seven Year War, Japanese access to the country was sharply constrained, and such incidents ceased to occur.\n\nJoseon's international relations implemented Korean Neo-Confucian ideal of \"serving the great\" (\"sadae\") to Chinese Ming dynasty and later Manchu Qing dynasty.\n\nOn a lower level, the country maintained ties with various neighboring nations, including the Jurchen tribes of the north and the Japanese and Ryūkyū states across the sea. To this end, interpreting schools were set up in the capital and in border towns such as Jeju and Busan.\n\nThe Joseon Dynasty endured two major invasions prior its progressive loss of sovereignty in the late 19th century. These were the Seven Year War, a two-stage Japanese invasion led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1590s, and the First and Second Manchu invasions in the early 17th century. Although the Japanese were ultimately repelled, Joseon was compelled to surrender to the Manchus, who later became the Qing Dynasty.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Ganghwa and the opening of the ports in 1876, the diplomatic approach changed, and the government of Joseon began to enter into diplomatic relations with both neighboring and European countries.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Unequal treaty\n\n"}
{"id": "5454132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5454132", "title": "Problem of future contingents", "text": "Problem of future contingents\n\nFuture contingent propositions (or simply, future contingents) are statements about states of affairs in the future that are \"contingent:\" neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.\n\nThe problem of future contingents seems to have been first discussed by Aristotle in chapter 9 of his \"On Interpretation\" (\"De Interpretatione\"), using the famous sea-battle example. Roughly a generation later, Diodorus Cronus from the Megarian school of philosophy stated a version of the problem in his notorious \"master argument\". The problem was later discussed by Leibniz.\n\nThe problem can be expressed as follows. Suppose that a sea-battle will not be fought tomorrow. Then it was also true yesterday (and the week before, and last year) that it will not be fought, since any true statement about what will be the case in the future was also true in the past. But all past truths are now necessary truths; therefore it is now necessarily true in the past, prior and up to the original statement \"A sea battle will not be fought tomorrow\", that the battle will not be fought, and thus the statement that it will be fought is necessarily false. Therefore, it is not possible that the battle will be fought. In general, if something will not be the case, it is not possible for it to be the case. \"For a man may predict an event ten thousand years beforehand, and another may predict the reverse; that which was truly predicted at the moment in the past will of necessity take place in the fullness of time\" (\"De Int.\" 18b35).\n\nThis conflicts with the idea of our own free choice: that we have the power to determine or control the course of events in the future, which seems impossible if what happens, or does not happen, is \"necessarily\" going to happen, or not happen. As Aristotle says, if so there would be no need \"to deliberate or to take trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain course, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result would not follow\".\n\nAristotle solved the problem by asserting that the principle of bivalence found its exception in this paradox of the sea battles: in this specific case, what is impossible is that both alternatives can be possible at the same time: either there \"will\" be a battle, or there won't. Both options can't be simultaneously taken. Today, they are neither true nor false; but if one is true, then the other becomes false. According to Aristotle, it is impossible to say today if the proposition is correct: we must wait for the contingent realization (or not) of the battle, logic realizes itself afterwards:\n\nFor Diodorus, the future battle was either impossible or necessary. Aristotle added a third term, contingency, which saves logic while in the same time leaving place for indetermination in reality. What is necessary is not that there will or that there won't be a battle tomorrow, but the dichotomy itself is necessary:\n\nThus, the event always comes in the form of the future, undetermined event; logic always comes afterwards. Hegel would say the same thing by claiming that wisdom came at dusk. For Aristotle, this is also a practical, ethical question: to pretend that the future is determined would have unacceptable consequences for man.\n\nLeibniz gave another response to the paradox in §6 of \"Discourse on Metaphysics\": \"That God does nothing which is not orderly, and that it is not even possible to conceive of events which are not regular.\" Thus, even a miracle, the Event by excellence, does not break the regular order of things. What is seen as irregular is only a default of perspective, but does not appear so in relation to universal order. Possibility exceeds human logics. Leibniz encounters this paradox because according to him:\nIf everything that happens to Alexander derives from the haecceity of Alexander, then fatalism threatens Leibniz's construction:\nAgainst Aristotle's separation between the subject and the predicate, Leibniz states:\nThe predicate (what happens to Alexander) must be completely included in the subject (Alexander) \"if one understands perfectly the concept of the subject\". Leibniz henceforth distinguishes two types of necessity: necessary necessity and contingent necessity, or universal necessity vs singular necessity. Universal necessity concerns universal truths, while singular necessity concerns something necessary that \"could\" not be (it is thus a \"contingent necessity\"). Leibniz hereby uses the concept of compossible worlds. According to Leibniz, contingent acts such as \"Caesar crossing the Rubicon\" or \"Adam eating the apple\" are necessary: that is, they are singular necessities, contingents and accidentals, but which concerns the principle of sufficient reason. Furthermore, this leads Leibniz to conceive of the subject not as a universal, but as a singular: it is true that \"Caesar crosses the Rubicon\", but it is true only of \"this\" Caesar at this \"time\", not of any dictator nor of Caesar at any time (§8, 9, 13). Thus Leibniz conceives of substance as plural: there is a plurality of singular substances, which he calls monads. Leibniz hence creates a concept of the individual as such, and attributes to it events. There is a universal necessity, which is universally applicable, and a singular necessity, which applies to each singular substance, or event. There is one proper noun for each singular event: Leibniz creates a logic of singularity, which Aristotle thought impossible (he considered that there could only be knowledge of generality).\n\nOne of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician Jan Łukasiewicz proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the \"as-yet-undetermined\". This approach was later developed by Arend Heyting and L. E. J. Brouwer; see Łukasiewicz logic.\n\nIssues such as this have also been addressed in various temporal logics, where one can assert that \"\"Eventually\", either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be.\" (Which is true if \"tomorrow\" eventually occurs.)\n\nBy asserting “\"A sea-fight must either take place tomorrow or not, but it is not necessary that it should take place tomorrow, neither is it necessary that it should not take place, yet it is necessary that it either should or should not take place tomorrow.\"” Aristotle is simply claiming “necessarily (a or not-a)”, which is correct.\n\nHowever, the next step in Aristotle’s reasoning seems to be : “If a is the case, then necessarily, a is the case”. This is known as the modal fallacy. \nExpressed in another way:\n\nThat is, there are no contingent propositions. Every proposition is either necessarily true or necessarily false.\nThe fallacy arises in the ambiguity of the first premise. If we interpret it close to the English, we get:\n\nHowever, if we recognize that the original English expression (i) is potentially misleading, that it assigns a necessity to what is simply nothing more than a necessary condition, then we get instead as our premises:\n\nFrom these latter two premises, one cannot validly infer the conclusion:\n\n\n\n"}

(also called de Panasz in some sources; , ; ; ; ; 4 October 1570 – 19 March 1637), was a Hungarian Jesuit who was a noted philosopher, theologian, cardinal, pulpit orator and statesman. He was an important figure in the Counter-Reformation in Royal Hungary.\n\nPázmány's most important legacy was his creation of the Hungarian literary language. As an orator he was dubbed \"the Hungarian Cicero in the purple\". In 1867, a street in Vienna, the Pazmanitengasse, was named after him.\n\nPázmány was born in 1570 in Nagyvárad, in the Principality of Transylvania (today Oradea, Romania), the son of Miklós Pázmány, vice-ispán of Bihar County. As a young he was educated there and, under the Jesuits, in Kolozsvár (Cluj), which is where he converted from the Calvinist Reformed Church of Hungary to Roman Catholicism in 1583, partly under the influence of his stepmother, a Catholic. In 1587 he entered the Society of Jesus.\n\nUpon entering the Jesuit Order, Pázmány went through his novitiate at Kraków, after which he studied philosophy in University of Vienna (1589-1592), and then theology at the Collegio Romano in Rome (now the Pontifical Gregorian University) under St. Robert Bellarmine, S.J. (1592-1596), after which he was ordained to the priesthood there. He was made a Doctor of Theology in 1597.\n\nAfter his studies, Pázmány was sent to Graz, Austria, first serving on the staff of the Jesuit college there for a year, then lecturing in theology at the University of Graz. In 1601 he was sent to the Society's establishment at Sellye (today Šaľa, Slovakia), where his eloquence and dialectic won hundreds to Catholicism, including many of the noblest families. Count Miklós Esterházy and Pál Rákóczi were among his converts.\n\nIn 1607 Pázmány entered the court of Archbishop Ferenc Forgách of Esztergom. The following year he attracted attention in the Diet of Hungary by his denunciation of the 8th point of the Peace of Vienna, which prohibited the Jesuits from acquiring landed property in Hungary. Particularly remarkable from this period is Pázmány's \"Guide to Truth\", which appeared in 1613. This manual was judged to have united all the advantages of scientific depth, methodical arrangement and popular style.\n\nAt the initiative of the archbishop and the request of King Matthias II of Hungary, Pope Paul V, by an apostolic brief dated 5 March 1616, granted Pázmány permission to leave the Society of Jesus and to enter the Somascan Clerics Regular; he never left the Jesuit Order, however, so there was only the submission of a request by third parties and the granting of a permission to leave.\n\nOn 25 April 1616 Pázmány was appointed the Provost of Turóc (Slovak Turiec), and on 28 September he was appointed by the Holy See as Archbishop of Esztergom, the Primate of Hungary. Pázmány was to become the soul of the Catholic Counter-Reformation in Hungary.\n\nAs the chief pastor of the Catholic Church in Hungary, Pázmány used every means in his power, short of absolute contravention of the laws, to obstruct and weaken Protestantism, which had risen during the 16th century. In 1619 he founded a seminary for theological candidates at Nagyszombat (today Trnava, Slovakia), and in 1623 laid the foundations of a similar institution at Vienna, the still famous Pázmáneum, at a cost of 200,000 florins. In 1635 he contributed 100,000 florins towards the foundation of the University in Nagyszombat (today's Trnava). The Faculty of Theology was later turned into Pázmány Péter Catholic University, and the rest of the university became what is now known as Eötvös Loránd University, which from 1921-1950 was known as Péter Pázmány University. Its theological faculty became Catholic Péter Pázmány University, Budapest/Piliscsaba, in 1992. Pázmány also built Jesuit colleges and schools at Pressburg (Bratislava), and Franciscan monasteries at Érsekújvár (now: Nové Zámky) and Körmöcbánya (now: Kremnica) (all in modernday Slovakia).\n\nPázmány played a considerable part in the politics of his day. It was chiefly due to him that the Diet of 1618 elected Archduke Ferdinand to succeed the childless Matthias. He also repeatedly thwarted the martial ambitions of Gabriel Bethlen, and prevented George I Rákóczi, over whom he had a great influence, from allying with the Ottoman Empire and the Protestants.\n\nPázmány was created a Cardinal Priest by Pope Urban VIII in the consistory of 19 November 1629. He received the red hat of a cardinal from the pope on 31 May 1629 at which time he was assigned for his titular church to Saint Jerome of the Croats.\n\nPázmány died in Pozsony (today Bratislava) in 1637 and was buried underneath the floor of St. Martin's Cathedral, at the foot of the ancient tomb of St. John the Almsgiver, which he had embellished during his reign.\n\nPázmány's grave was discovered during reconstruction on 12 September 1859 by the Rev. Ferdinand Knauz and others. They found the body dry yet almost intact. His face was missing the nose and lips but was still bearded, and he still had his biretta on his head with some hair underneath. He was wearing red damask vestments and had simple leather shoes on his feet.\n\n\n\"Grazer philosophische Disputationen\" von Péter Pázmány, ed.

{"id": "4408655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4408655", "title": "Ramsey sentence", "text": "Ramsey sentence\n\nRamsey sentences are formal logical reconstructions of theoretical propositions attempting to draw a line between science and metaphysics. A Ramsey sentence aims at rendering propositions containing non-observable theoretical terms (terms employed by a theoretical language) clear by substituting them with observational terms (terms employed by an observation language, also called empirical language).\n\nRamsey sentences were introduced by the logical empiricist philosopher Rudolf Carnap. They are also known as Carnap sentences.\n\nFor Carnap, questions such as: “Are electrons real?” and: “Can you prove electrons are real?” were not legitimate questions implying great philosophical/metaphysical import. They were meaningless \"pseudo-questions without cognitive content,” asked from outside a language framework of science. Inside this framework, entities such as electrons or sound waves, and relations such as mass and force not only exist and have meaning, but are \"useful\" to the scientists who work with them. To accommodate such internal questions in a way that would justify their theoretical content empirically – and to do so while maintaining a distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions – Carnap set out to develop a systematized way to consolidate theory and empirical observation in a meaningful language formula.\n\nCarnap began by differentiating observable things from non-observable things. Immediately, a problem arises: neither the German nor the English language naturally distinguish predicate terms on the basis of an observational categorization. As Carnap admitted, \"The line separating observable from non-observable is highly arbitrary.\" For example, the predicate \"hot\" can be perceived by touching a hand to a lighted coal. But \"hot\" might take place at such a microlevel (e.g., the theoretical \"heat\" generated by the production of proteins in a eukaryotic cell) that it is virtually non-observable (at present). Physicist-philosopher Moritz Schlick characterized the difference linguistically, as the difference between the German verbs \"kennen\" (knowing as being acquainted with a thing – perception) and \"erkennen\" (knowing as understanding a thing – even if non-observable). This linguistic distinction may explain Carnap’s decision to divide the vocabulary into two artificial categories: a vocabulary of non-observable (\"theoretical\") terms (hereafter \"V\"): i.e., terms we know of but are not acquainted with (erkennen), and a vocabulary of observable terms (\"V\"), those terms we are acquainted with (kennen) and will accept arbitrarily. Accordingly, the terms thus distinguished were incorporated into comparable sentence structures: T-terms into theoretical sentences (T-sentences); O-terms into observational sentences (O-sentences).\n\nThe next step for Carnap was to connect these separate concepts by what he calls \"correspondence rules\" (C-rules), which are \"mixed\" sentences containing both T- and O-terms. Such a theory can be formulated as: T + C = df: the conjunction of T-postulates + the conjunction of C-rules – i.e., formula_1. This can be further expanded to include class terms such as for the class of all molecules, relations such as \"betweenness,\" and predicates: e.g., TC ( t, t, . . ., t, o, o, . . ., o). Though this enabled Carnap to establish what it means for a theory to be \"empirical,\" this sentence neither defines the T-terms explicitly nor draws any distinction between its analytic and its synthetic content, therefore it was not yet sufficient for Carnap’s purposes.\n\nIn the theories of Frank P. Ramsey, Carnap found the method he needed to take the next step, which was to substitute variables for each T-term, then to quantify existentially all T-terms in both T-sentences and C-rules. The resulting \"Ramsey sentence\" effectively eliminated the T-terms as such, while still providing an account of the theory’s empirical content. The evolution of the formula proceeds thus:\n\nStep 3 is the complete Ramsey sentence, expressed \"TC,\" and to be read: \"There are some (unspecified) relations such that TC (\"x\" . . . \"x\", \"o\" . . . \"o\") is satisfied when the variables are assigned these relations. (This is equivalent to an interpretation as an appropriate model: there are relations \"r\" . . . \"r\" such that TC (\"x\" . . . \"x\", \"o\" . . . \"o\") is satisfied when x is assigned the value r, and formula_4.)\n\nIn this form, the Ramsey sentence captures the factual content of the theory. Though Ramsey believed this formulation was adequate to the needs of science, Carnap disagreed, with regard to a comprehensive\nreconstruction. In order to delineate a distinction between analytic and synthetic content, Carnap thought the reconstructed sentence would have to satisfy three desired requirements:\n\nRequirement 1 is satisfied by TC in that the existential quantification of the T-terms does not change the logical truth (L-truth) of either statement, and the reconstruction FT has the same O-sentences as the theory itself, hence TC is observationally equivalent to TC : (i.e., for\nevery O-sentence: O, formula_6 ). As stated, however, requirements 2 and 3 remain unsatisfied. That is, taken individually, A does contain observational information (such-and-such a theoretical entity is observed to do such-and-such, or hold such-and-such a relation); and A does not necessarily follow from F.\n\nCarnap’s solution is to make the two statements conditional. If there are some relations such that [TC (x1 . . . xn, o1 . . . om)] is satisfied when the variables are assigned some relations, then the relations assigned to those variables by the original theory will satisfy [TC (t1 . . . tn, o1 . . . om)] – or: TC → TC. This important move satisfies both remaining requirements and effectively creates a distinction between the total formula’s analytic and synthetic components. Specifically, for requirement 2: The conditional sentence does not make any information claim about the O-sentences in TC, it states only that \"if\" the variables in are satisfied by the relations, \"then\" the O-sentences will be true. This means that every O-sentence in TC that is logically implied by the sentence TC → TC is L-true (i.e., every O-sentence in AT is true or not-true: the metal expands or it does not; the chemical turns blue or it does not, etc.). Thus TC can be taken as the non-informative (i.e., non-factual) component of the statement, or A. Requirement 3 is satisfied by inference: given A, infer F → A. This makes A + F nothing more than a reformulation of the original theory, hence A Ù F\nó TC.\n\nCarnap took as a fundamental requirement a respect for the analytic–synthetic distinction. This is met by using two distinct processes in the formulation: drawing an empirical connection between the statement’s factual content and the original theory (observational equivalence), and by requiring the analytic content to be observationally non-informative.\n\nCarnap’s reconstruction as it is given here is not intended to be a literal method for formulating scientific propositions. To capture what Pierre Duhem would call the entire \"holistic\" universe relating to any specified theory would require long and complicated renderings of TC → TC. Instead, it is to be taken as demonstrating logically that there is a way that science could formulate empirical, observational explications of theoretical concepts – and in that context the Ramsey and Carnap construct can be said to provide a formal justificatory\ndistinction between scientific observation and metaphysical inquiry.\n\nAmong critics of the Ramsey formalism are John Winnie, who extended the requirements to include an \"observationally non-creative\" restriction on Carnap’s A – and both W. V. O. Quine and Carl Hempel attacked Carnap’s initial assumptions by emphasizing the ambiguity that persists between observable and non-observable terms.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the doctrine that God created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted \"rationes seminales\", from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing.\n\nThe roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the Stoics and Neoplatonism\nThe idea was incorporated into Christian thought through the writings of authors such as Athenagoras of Athens, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine of Hippo, Bonaventure, Albertus Magnus, and Roger Bacon, until mostly rejected in the modern period.

It states that:\n\nNote that \"randomly selected\" is weighted by the probability of the observers existing: under SIA you are still unlikely to be an unlikely observer, unless there are a lot of them. It is one of the two major schools of anthropic probability, the other being the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA).\n\nFor instance, if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails it will create two, then we have three possible observers (1st observer on heads, 1st on tails, 2nd on tails), each existing with probability 0.5, so SIA assigns 1/3 probability to each. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as saying there are two possible observers (1st observer on either heads or tails, 2nd observer on tails), the first existing with probability one and the second existing with probability 1/2, so SIA assigns 2/3 to being the first observer and 1/3 to being the second - which is the same as the first interpretation.\n\nThis is why SIA gives an answer of 1/3 probability of heads in the Sleeping Beauty Problem.\n\nNotice that unlike SSA, SIA is not dependent on the choice of reference class, as long as the reference class is large enough to contain all subjectively indistinguishable observers. If the reference class is large, SIA will make it more likely, but this is compensated by the much reduced probability that the agent will be \"that particular agent\" in the larger reference class.\n\nAlthough this anthropic principle was originally designed as a rebuttal to the Doomsday argument (by Dennis Dieks in 1992) it has general applications in the philosophy of anthropic reasoning, and Ken Olum has suggested it is important to the analysis of quantum cosmology.\n\nKen Olum has written in defense of the SIA.

This includes, among others, the rules by which the requirements of the Oral Law and the Halakha are derived from and established by the written law.\n\nThese rules relate to: \n\nCompilations of such hermeneutic rules were made in the earliest times. The tannaitic tradition recognizes three such collections, namely: \n\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor Eliezer ben Jose sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day. For some reason they restricted themselves to a compilation of the principal methods of logical deduction, which they called \"middot\" (measures), although the other rules also were known by that term (comp. Sifre, Num. 2 [ed. Friedmann, p. 2a])..\n\nThose rules are traditionally studied and applied to the religious texts of some biblical canon, which were commonly believed to be inspired by God himself, through the words and the actions of human people. Therefore, those rules were related in coordination with the four independent level of biblical reading, as in the acronym Pardes.\n\nAll the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in \"Ayyelet HaShachar,\" the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra, and have been reckoned at 613, to correspond with the 613 commandments. The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them, meaning that they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot of Hillel and the 13 of Rabbi Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them. At all events, he did not invent them, but merely collected them as current in his day, though he possibly amplified them. They were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricting or expanding them, in various ways.\n\nThe Talmud itself gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim regarded them as Sinaitic (הלכה למשה מסיני, \"Law given to Moses at Mount Sinai\"; comp. Rabbi Samson of Chinon in his \"Sefer HaKeritot\").\n\nRabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. Rabbi Akiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Rabbi Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles which guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous. He established two principles broadening the scope of the rule of his teacher Nahum of Gimzo, who had declared that certain particles, like את, גם and או, were inclusive and certain others, such as אך, רק and מן, were exclusive. These two principles are: \nHence he interprets the following forms of expression as amplifications: an infinitive before a finite verb, e.g., הכרת תכרת (Sanhedrin 64b); the doubling of a word, e.g., איש איש (Yeb. 71a); and the repetition of a term by a synonym, e.g., ודבר ואמר (Jerusalem Talmud Soṭah viii. 22b). Ishmael, on the contrary, lays down the principle, (דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם = \"the Torah speaks in the language of men\"; Sifre, Num. 112). The Bible may, therefore, have employed superfluous words and sounds; and forced values should not be assigned to them for the purpose of deducing new rules therefrom.\n\nThe same statement holds with regard to the repetition of an entire section. Ishmael is of the opinion that \"the Torah at times repeats a whole section of the Law in order to give a new application to it\" (כל פרשה שנאמרה במקום אחד וחזרו שנאה במקום אחר לא שנאה אלא בשביל דבר שנתחדש בה ; Sifre, Num. 2, according to the reading of Elijah of Vilna). It is not necessary, therefore, to draw a new inference from every repetition. Thus, for instance, in Num. v. 5-8 the Torah repeats the section on אשם גזלות in Lev. v. 20-26 (vi. 1-7, A. V.) for the purpose of teaching the new ruling that in certain cases recompense for sin shall be made directly to the priests. Akiva asserts, on the other hand (in Sifre, l.c., according to the reading of Elijah of Vilna), that \"Everything that is said in a section so repeated must be interpreted\" (= כל מה שנאמר בה צריך להדרש), and that new deductions may be drawn from it. According to this view, in Num. v. 5-8, for example, a new meaning must be sought in the repetition of the Law.\n\nAccording to Akiva, the traditional vocalization in the Bible of a word which may be read in various ways is well founded (יש אם למקרא); and he deduces many rules from the meanings which such words have according to traditional pointing. This rule had been formulated before Akiva by a tanna named Rabbi Judah ben Ro'eẓ, who is not mentioned elsewhere, and of whom, consequently, nothing more is known (comp. Sanhedrin 4a). Ishmael, in opposition to Akiva, follows the principle יש אם למסורת, i.e., that the tradition regarding only the consonantal text is authoritative, and that rules may be deduced only from that text. A single example will serve to illustrate the difference between the methods of the two schools. In Lev. xxi. 11, in the law which forbids a priest to defile himself by touching a corpse, the word נפשת is written defectively. Since the traditional reading indicates the plural, \"nafshot\", Akiva draws the conclusion that a quarter-log of blood, the minimum quantity by which a priest may be rendered unclean through contact with a single corpse, also defiles him when it issues from two bodies. According to Ishmael, however, this minimum quantity defiles a priest only when it issues from a single corpse; for the word, according to the consonantal text, is to be read in the singular \"nafshat\" (comp. Sanhedrin 4a, b, Hullin 72a, and Tosafot to both passages).\n\nAccording to Akiva, laws may be deduced from the juxtaposition of two legal sections, since \"every passage which stands close to another must be explained and interpreted with reference to its neighbor\" (כל פרשה שהיא סמוכה לחבירתה למדה הימנה; Sifre, Num. 131). According to Ishmael, on the contrary, nothing may be inferred from the position of the individual sections, since it is not at all certain that every single portion now stands in its proper place. Many a paragraph which forms, strictly speaking, the beginning of a book and should stand in that position, has been transposed to the middle. Ishmael explains the occurrence of a section in a place where it does not properly belong (ולמה נכתב כאן) by declaring that \"there is no first or last in the Scriptures\" (אלא מפני שאין מקדם ומאחר בתורה), not as due to any special reason (Mekhilta, ed. Weiss, p. 48a; Ecclesiastes Rabbah i.; comp. Pesahim 6b, where Rav Papa defines this principle in such a manner that it does not contradict Ishmael's rules concerning \"Kelal uferat\"). Eliezer ben Jose expanded this rule in his baraita (Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules) and divided it into two parts (Nos. 31 and 32).\n\nNonetheless, this method is utilized in many instances, for example: Deuteronomy 22:11 speaks of the commandment forbidding the wearing of shaatnez, a specific mixture of wool and linen. The next verse discussed the directive to make tzitzit, the fringes tied to four-cornered garments. The juxtaposition of these two verses is used to teach that the transgression of shaatnez is not violated when one wears a four cornered garment of linen bearing tzitzis of wool (the wool here is actually the thread(s) of tekhelet, a blue-dyed woolen thread. While the white strings of the tzitzit could be of any material, the blue string must be wool, even when the subsequent garment would be a mixture of wool and linen.)\n\nJuxtaposition through \"exemplification\" or משל has recently been described by Talmudist Daniel Boyarin as the \"sine qua non\" of Talmudic hermeneutics (Boyarin 2003: 93), for \"until Solomon invented the \"mashal\", no one could understand Torah at all\" (\"Song of Songs Rabba\"). The phenomenon has been compared to the more recent phenomenon of sampling in modern popular music, especially hip-hop (Levy 2010).\n\nThe opposition between the schools of Ishmael and Akiva lessened gradually, and finally vanished altogether, so that the later tannaim apply the axioms of both indiscriminately, although the hermeneutics of Akiva predominated.\n\nThe first rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael is \"kal va-chomer\" (), called also \"din\" (conclusion). This is the argument \"a minori ad majus\" or \"a majori ad minus\". In the Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules this rule is divided into two (Nos. 5 and 6), since a distinction is made between a course of reasoning carried to its logical conclusion in the Holy Scriptures themselves (\"kal va-chomer meforash\") and one merely suggested there (\"kal va-chomer satum\"). The completed argument is illustrated in ten examples given in Genesis Rabbah xcii.\n\nThe full name of this rule should be \"kal va-chomer, chomer ve-kal\" (simple and complex, complex and simple), since by it deductions are made from the simple to the complex or vice versa, according to the nature of the conclusion required. The major premise on which the argument is based is called \"nadon\", or, at a later period, \"melammed\" (that which teaches); the conclusion resulting from the argument is termed בא מן הדין (\"ba min ha-din\", that which \"comes from the rule\") or, later, \"lamed\" (that which learns). The process of deduction in the kal va-chomer is limited by the rule that the conclusion may contain nothing more than is found in the premise. This is the so-called \"dayyo\" law, which many teachers, however, ignored. It is formulated thus: דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון (\"The conclusion of an argument is satisfied when it is like the major premise\").\n\nThere is a dispute regarding the thirteen principles: Either the kal va-chomer is unique among the thirteen rules in that it may be applied by anyone in any circumstance in which it logically applies and the remaining twelve rules may only be applied with a tradition of application descending from Moses (or another authoritative legal board of the era) or all thirteen except a gezerah shava are open to all and only the latter is restricted in its application.\n\nFor example, one may make the following logical reasoning and support it using the basis of this rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if the parent is so upset about one item of clothing, surely he or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. A somewhat easier construct would be to assert \"if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make the same three-pointer,\" but this might be attacked as a poor analogy because not everyone can make every shot.\n\nHowever, one must be careful of falling into the trap of an illogical deduction, as explained above by \"dayyo\". An example of this would be as follows: If a parent will punish his or her child with a minor punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child with a major punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. This is an illogical deduction; although it might be a fair speculation, it cannot be proven with logic. All that can be proven is at least the result of the lesser offense. This would be akin to asserting \"if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make a half-court shot.\"\n\nThe discovery of a fallacy in the process of deduction is called \"teshuvah\" (objection), or, in the terminology of the amoraim, \"pirka\". The possibility of such an objection is never wholly excluded, hence the deduction of the kal va-chomer has no absolute certainty. The consequences of this are: (a) that the conclusions have, according to many teachers, no real value in criminal procedure, a view expressed in the axiom that the conclusion is insufficient to punish the violator of an inferred prohibition (אין עונשין מן הדין ; Sifre, Num. 1); (b) that very often a passage is interpreted to mean something which may be inferred by means of a kal va-chomer (מילתא דאתיא בק\"ו טרח וכתב לה קרא ; Pesahim 18b; Yoma 43a).\n\nAn example of a situation in which transgressions are specifically not punished according to \nkal va-chomer is as follows: Leviticus 18:21 speaks of the prohibition of worshiping Molech, a form of worship in which children were passed through fire (presumably until dead). Now, one would assume that if it were prohibited to pass some of one's children through the fire, surely it would be prohibited to pass \"all\" of one's children through the fire –- a kal va-chomer. However, it is derived from the verse's use of the word \"ומזרעך\", lit. \"and from your seed\", that this prohibition is only when \"some\" of one's children are sacrificed in this worship; when all of one's children are sacrificed, this is not punishable. This is explained with the reasoning that the intention of the Molech worship is to improve the health and well-being of one's remaining children, whereas complete sacrifice defeats the purported purpose of the service, rendering it unpunishable by lack of intent to perform it properly.\n\nThe \"gezerah shavah\" (\"Similar laws, similar verdicts\") is the second rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael, and the seventh of Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili. This may be described as argument by analogy, which infers from the similarity of two cases that the legal decision given for the one holds good for the other also. The term \"gezerah shavah\" originally included arguments based on analogies either in word or in fact. Before long, however, the latter class was designated as \"hekkesh\", while the phrase \"gezerah shavah\" was limited to analogy in the case of two different Biblical laws containing a word common to both. The \"gezerah shavah\" was originally restricted to a δὶς λεγόμενον (bis legomenon), i.e., a word occurring only in the two passages offering the analogy. Since such a word is found nowhere else, there is no reason to assume that it bears different meanings in the two passages. The \"gezerah shavah\" consequently attaches to the word in the one passage the entire sequence of ideas which it bears in the other. Such a \"gezerah shavah\" is purely lexicographical, as seeking to determine the exact signification of a word by comparison with another passage in which the full meaning of such word is clear. The rule thus demonstrates itself.\n\nAn example will illustrate this more clearly. The phrase מלק את ראשו (\"to wring off the head\") occurs only twice in the Pentateuch, namely, in Leviticus i. 15 and ib. v. 8. In the latter passage, however, the meaning of the phrase is more closely defined by ממול ערפו (\"from the neck\"). The Sifra (ed. Weiss, p. 9a) concludes, therefore, that the nearer definition, \"from the neck\", in the second passage, is part of the concept of the word מלק, and, consequently, that in the former passage, also, מלק means \"to wring the head from the neck\". At a later period, however, the gezerah shavah emerged from these narrow bounds and inferred the identity of legal requirements from the identity of their terminology, even when such terminology occurred in many passages besides the two which formed the analogy. Thereby the gezerah shavah lost its inherent power of demonstration; for it is wholly unreasonable to attribute to a word a meaning which happens to be associated with it in a single passage, when various other passages connect ideas entirely different with the same word. Since, moreover, each individual teacher might choose which two expressions he would select for a \"gezerah shavah\", contradictory conclusions might be drawn, which would each have the same claim to validity, since both were obtained by a \"gezerah shavah\". Consequently, in order to be binding, a \"gezerah shavah\" was obliged to conform to two requirements which, on the one hand, greatly restricted its application, and, on the other, gave legal decisions thus obtained the value of those deduced from a superfluous word in the Holy Scriptures. These conditions are:\n\n\nIn \"binyan ab mi-katub echad\" (\"A standard from a passage of Scripture\") a certain passage serves as a basis for the interpretation of many others, so that the decision given in the case of one is valid for all the rest.\n\nBy this rule of \"binyan ab mi-shene ketubim\" (\"A standard from two passages of Scripture\") a decision in two laws having a characteristic in common (הצד השוה) is applied to many other laws which have this same characteristic. Rabbi Ishmael unites rules 2 and 4 in his third rule, while the same combination forms the eighth rule of Rabbi Eliezer.\n\nThe rules of \"Kelal u-perat\" and \"perat u-kelal\" (\"General and particular, particular and general\") is a limitation of the general by the particular and vice versa. According to Rabbi Ishmael, this principle has eight special applications, and thus includes eight separate rules in his scheme (Nos. 4-11). This method of limitation is one of the main points of difference between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the former, who follows his teacher Rabbi Nehunya ben HaKanah, the particular is only an elucidation of the preceding general expression, so that the latter includes only what is contained in the particular (כלל ופרט אין בכלל אלא מה שבפרט). But if still another general follows the particular, the two general expressions are defined by the intermediate particular, so that the law applies only to what is like the particular (כלל ופרט וכלל אי אתה מרבה אלא כעין הפרט). Akiva, on the contrary, applies the rule of increase and decrease (רבוי ומיעוט) which had been taught him by his teacher Nahum of Gimzo. According to this principle, the general followed by a particular subsumes everything which is like the particular (Sanhedrin 45b, 46a). If, however, another general term follows the particular, the former subsumes also what is not similar to the latter. The two general terms are decreased in only one respect by the intermediate particular (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי ריבה הכל ומאי מיעט דבר אחר ; Shebu. 26a; comp. also Rashi on Sanhedrin l.c.).\n\nThe difference between \"kelal u-perat u-kelal\" (כלל ופרט וכלל) and \"ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui\" (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי) is exemplified in the following example: Exodus 25:31 states ועשית מנרת זהב טהור מקשה תיעשה המנורה, \"You shall make a \"Menorah\" of pure gold, hammered out shall the \"Menorah\" be made.\" The repetitive fashion of the statement can be explained by the \"kelal u-perat u-kelal\" or the \"ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui\".\n\nWhichever method of deduction is employed, the word ועשית (\"You shall make\") is an objective generalization, the words מנרת זהב (\"pure gold\") are an objective specification and the word תיעשה (shall be made\") is again an objective generalization. The rule of \"kelal u-perat u-kelal\" works to teach that anything similar to the specification is deemed appropriate, while the rule of \"ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui\" is more inclusive, allowing everything \"except\" the thing \"most dissimilar\" to the specification.\n\nThus, Rashi's commentary in \"Rosh Hashanah\" 24b asserts that, according to the former method of learning this verse, the \"Menorah\" could, when necessary, be constructed of any metal (deemed in the same category of and thus similar to gold), whereas use of the latter method of learning would allow the \"Menorah\" to be constructed of anything but clay (deemed the material most dissimilar to gold). This argument arose because the \"gemarah\" made reference to a wooden \"Menorah\" overlaid with tin that was constructed in the times of the \"Chashmunaim\" and used in the Temple service.\n\nThe rule \"Ka-yotze bo mi-makom acher\" (\"Like that in another place\") refers to explaining a Biblical passage according to another of similar content.\n\nDabar ha-lamed me-inyano (\"Something proved by the context\") refers to definition from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead which is not found in Hillel, and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם (\"If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage\"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by the help of a third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, Simeon ben Eleazar laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא (\"Do not read so, but so\"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.\n\nTo support a halakic decision, and more especially to find a point of departure in the aggadah, the traditional reading of a word is altered by transposition of its consonants or by substitution of others which are related to them, or the consonant-group is retained with alteration of its vowels, the last method being the most frequent. A halakic example of this form of hermeneutics is the interpretation of the word \"kapot\" (bough; Leviticus 23:40) as though it were \"kaput\" (bound; Sifra, ed. Weiss, p. 102d; Sukkah 32a). It is noteworthy, moreover, that only the tannaim derived new halakot with the aid of these rules, while the amoraim employed them only in advancing haggadic explanations or in establishing the old halakhot of the Tannaim.\n\n"}
{"id": "32589779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32589779", "title": "Vortex Garden", "text": "Vortex Garden\n\nThe Vortex Garden is a privately owned public garden in the Hessian city of Darmstadt (Germany). It is a pantheistic permaculture garden at the art nouveau area of Mathildenhoehe and alludes to Viktor Schauberger’s discovery of “levitational force” through artistic depictions by internationally renowned sculptors including John Wilkes, Jacopo Foggini, Jerome Abel Seguin and Hyesung Hyun. The garden is the private property of Henry Nold of Darmstadt, but is open to the public.\n\nThe term “Vortex” denotes an eddy or whirling movement. For the owner of the garden it means spirals or helix-shaped forms and, by extension, evokes concepts such as DNA, double helix and the building blocks of life.\nThe Vortex Garden, along with the “Haus Hubertus” built in 1921 by the architect Jan Hubert Pinand for the Diefenbach family, is the basis of a new form of “sacred topography”, a tribute to the life reform movement, which considered itself an alternative to both communism and capitalism.\n\nThe charismatic effect of the German and Swiss artists’ colonies of Mathildenhoehe, Worpswede, Amden and Monte Verità nurtured creativity in bohemians and free thinkers and was conducive to the emergence of other utopian projects and a new context of alternative thinking in Europe. Behind this was the dream of all those who suffered from the loss of paradise and longed to find a new one: Anarchists, Nudists, Feminists, Dadaists, Pacifists, Freemasons, Theosophists and Self-seekers. What appealed to these people more and more was the spirit of utopia and a new definition of self through the creation of their own mythology far removed from time-honoured life processes and habits. \nThe Vortex Garden mirrors this desire for a place where energies operating invisibly are recollected and brought together and, when reflected upon, can manifest themselves.\n\nAnother theme in the Vortex Garden is that of sacred geometry and cosmological numerical relationships, such as the “golden mean” and the Fibonacci number sequence derived from it, frequently found in the crop circles, often 70 meters in diameter, that mysteriously appear each year mainly in fields in England up until the grain harvest. Smaller versions of these crop circles are immortalised at Prinz-Christians-Weg 13, Darmstadt in the form of mosaics and tiling pictograms, as well as three-dimensionally in sculpture of meticulous craftsmanship. The highly complex patterns of these corn circles are drawn as step-by-step comprehensible geometric designs and have an orderly, decorous effect on the environment in which they are located—as in the case of the side entrance staircase, where a row of engraved bronze coins stands side by side interspersed at short intervals with 48 various crop circle pictograms. A photograph of Goethe’s summerhouse in Weimar showing a stone pentagram on the floor provided the inspiration for the crop circle mosaic of limestone slabs in the pavilion with sparkling glass prisms in the dome design. \n\nThe 108 egg-shaped walkway stepping-stones placed around the house provide a lunar evocation, mirrored in silver precious metal with an atomic weight of 108 and reminiscent of the radius of the moon, 1080 miles.\n\nIn the organically-shaped cascading pools by John Wilkes, the water makes flowing lemniscate patterns with various rhythms according to the different basin widths. The trick fountains are supplied with rainwater from the gutters through three tanks; enhanced by the invigorating motion in the flowform basins, the water is used for garden irrigation. \n\nIn the Vortex Garden, garden soil and plant maintenance is based on principles of the permaculture approach. On the recommendations of Hermann Benjes, a relatively large number of dead wood stacks and woodpiles provide choice breeding grounds for microorganisms in this town garden.\n\nThe pond, dug out in a crater-like, ovoid form and topped with a round wooden walkway and magenta-coloured Stalattite sculpture by Jacopo Foggini, is styled on runic exercise “funnels” that were dug into the ground for gymnastics practice and entailed considerable earth movement. A three-legged copper funnel with a bell-shaped and spirally swirling waterflow brings vitality to the biotope.\n\nSet on a ledge between the two large bat nesting boxes in front of the upstairs bedroom windows are a large number of short logs with thousands upon thousands of holes on the end grain side to form possible dwellings for insects (see also insect hotel). Elsewhere a canopied clay egg almost 2 meters high with holes cut into its surface may be considered a home for solitary bees and a nesting site for other insects. Several honeycombed boxes are set in the garden for honeybees.\n\nFrom his findings gleaned over 30 years spent observing nature in pristine areas of Austria, Viktor Schauberger sought to implement basic life and movement processes and principles for the production of alternative fuel energy for machines, turbines, engines or to generate heat. Visitors to the Vortex Garden can experience such implosive forces and empathize with the way that life forces can or may emerge, grow and develop.\n\nThe name “Vortex” derives from the many flowform water features and funnels with spiralling and lemniscate (figure-eight shaped) forms of water movement.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2430637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2430637", "title": "What I Believe", "text": "What I Believe\n\n\"What I Believe\" is the title of two essays espousing humanism, one by Bertrand Russell (1925) and one by E. M. Forster (1938).\n\nSeveral other authors have also written works with the same title, alluding to either or both of these essays.\n\n\"What I Believe\" was first published as a book in 1925. As Russell wrote in the preface, \"In this little book, I have tried to say what I think of man's place in the universe, and of his possibilities in the way of achieving the good life. \"\n\nHis essay may be summed in his quote: \"The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge\".\n\nHe does not claim this is a logically necessary belief, but instead he wishes to convince the most people to believe in it by providing examples and its consequences.\nI believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am not young and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation. Happiness is nonetheless true happiness because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are not everlasting. Many a man has borne himself proudly on the scaffold; surely the same pride should teach us to think truly about man's place in the world. Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cosy indoor warmth of traditional humanizing myths, in the end the fresh air brings vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their own.\nE. M. Forster says that he does not believe in creeds; but there are so many around that one has to formulate a creed of one’s own in self-defence. Three values are important to Forster: tolerance, good temper and sympathy.\n\nIt was first published in \"The Nation\" on July 16, 1938.\n\nForster argues that one should invest in personal relationships: “one must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life”. In order to do so, one must be reliable in one’s relationships. Reliability, in turn, is impossible without natural warmth. Forster contrasts personal relationships with causes, which he hates. In an often quoted sentence he argues: “If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country”. He goes on to explain:\n\nForster cautiously welcomes democracy for two reasons:\n\n\nThus, he calls for \"two cheers for democracy\" (also the title of the book which contains his essay) but argues that this is \"quite enough\" and that \"there is no occasion to give three.\"\n\nForster goes on to argue that, although the state ultimately rests on force, the intervals between the use of force are what makes life worth living. Some people may call the absence of force decadence; Forster prefers to call it civilization.\n\nThe author also criticises hero-worship and profoundly distrusts so-called “great men”. Heroes are necessary to run an authoritarian regime in order to make it seem less dull “much as plums have to be put into a bad pudding to make it palatable”. As a contrast Forster believes in an “aristocracy”, not based on rank or influence but an aristocracy of the sensitive, the considerate and the plucky. For Forster it is a tragedy that no way has been found to transmit private decencies into public life:\n\nThe more highly public life is organized the lower does its morality sink; the nations of today behave to each other worse than they ever did in the past, they cheat, rob, bully and bluff, make war without notice, and kill as many women and children as possible; whereas primitive tribes were at all events restrained by taboos. It is a humiliating outlook - though the greater the darkness, the brighter shine the little lights, reassuring one another, signalling: \"Well, at all events, I'm still here. I don’t like it very much, but how are you?\"\n\nForster concludes by stating that these “are the reflections of an individualist and a liberal\" who has \"found liberalism crumbling beneath him\", taking comfort from the fact that people are born separately and die separately. Therefore, no dictator will be able to eradicate individualism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4444260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4444260", "title": "Wilhelm Feldberg", "text": "Wilhelm Feldberg\n\nWilhelm Siegmund Feldberg CBE FRS (19 November 1900 – 23 October 1993) was a German-British physiologist and biologist.\n\nFeldberg was born in Hamburg to a wealthy middle class Jewish family. He studied medicine at Heidelberg, Munich and Berlin, graduating in 1925. In the same year he moved with his new wife to England and studied first under John Newport Langley at Cambridge and then Henry Dale at Hampstead. In 1927 he returned to the Physiological Institute in Berlin but he was dismissed in 1933 during the Nazi purge of Jewish scientists. With the aid of Archibald Hill's Academic Assistance Council, Feldberg was relocated to Britain's National Institute for Medical Research in 1934–36. Here, he worked with Henry Hallett Dale, providing a significant impetus for Dale's Nobel Prize winning research into chemical neurotransmission. Feldberg was subsequently offered a place in Australia, at the behest of Charles Kellaway, director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He spent two years (1936–38) in Melbourne, joining Kellaway's snake venom research programme. This work developed into a study of tissue responses to direct and indirect insult, focusing particularly on the liberation of histamine and other endogenous mediators. A finding of lasting pharmacological interest from these studies was the identification and partial isolation of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. Although Feldberg had earned a fellowship supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, in 1938 he was offered a readership in physiology at Cambridge University. He returned to England to take up this post, remaining there throughout World War II until 1949. Feldberg's subsequent appointments include: Head of Physiology and Pharmacology Division, National Institute for Medical Research, London, 1949–65 (Honorary Head of Division, 1965–66); Head, Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, National Institute for Medical Research, 1966–74. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947 and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1963.\n\nWilhelm Feldberg assisted many research workers who came to England as a part of their Commonwealth Medical Fellowship and Wellcome Research Fellowship. Under this Fellowships, Professor PN Saxena and Prof. KP Gupta of the Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, during the 1970s got many papers published together with Wilhelm Feldberg while their vocation at National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill.\n\nFeldberg's career was ended in 1990 when two animal rights activists gained access to his lab on the pretence of writing a biography and filming an educational video. Their claims were printed in \"The Independent\". An investigation by the Medical Research Council found that some breaches of regulations had occurred. While these may not have been Feldberg's fault, he was deemed responsible and his Home Office Project Licence was revoked. One of the animal rights activists involved, Melody MacDonald, detailed her claims in her 1994 book \"Caught in the Act: The Feldberg Investigation\" ().\n\nFeldberg became infamous, as MacDonald puts it, for his severe cruelty during animal research experiments. In the year of 1990, an investigation by the animal rights group Advocates for Animals revealed experiments in which rabbits were regularly burned and operated on without adequate anaesthesia, or even at all, and sometimes even without being covered by a licence.\n\nThese revelations came when Feldberg was 89 years old. These experiments took place at the National Institute for Medical Research laboratories, Mill Hill, in London, which relate to the functions and decisions of the Home Department. These experiments took place between 1989 and 1990.\n\nAlong with Feldberg's technician Mr. Stean, the Medical Research Council Inquiry found that he caused both unnecessary suffering to animals.\n\nMacDonald reports that Feldberg experimented by pouring various chemicals into the brains of cats while alive and fully conscious. However, as MacDonald and the inquiry found, it was his experiments on rabbits that brought about his downfall and subsequent sacking in 1990. This was just four months after he was awarded the Wellcome Gold Medal in Pharmacology by the British Pharmacological Society.\n\nOn 26 May 1994 the book \"Caught in the Act: The Feldberg Investigation\" by Melody MacDonald exposed his alleged malpractice to the world.\n\nDr. Vernon Coleman writes that \"Just before Christmas 1989 two undercover operators finally persuaded Feldberg to allow them to take video and still photographs of him at work. Flattered by the attention he was getting (one of the investigators, Melody MacDonald, was a former fashion model (she published her investigation in the above mentioned book)) Feldberg agreed.\" Vernon goes on to state that \"\"As a result of film which the investigators took just after Feldberg's eightyninth birthday, the Medical Research Council held an inquiry. The published report of the inquiry shows that according to the Medical Research Council Feldberg failed to ensure that four of the rabbits he used were sufficiently anaesthetized during experiments performed at the National Institute for Medical Research, in Mill Hill, London. The Medical Research Council's report describes the benefit likely to accrue from Feldberg's work as 'negligible' and admitted that 'applied to the methodology the word \"crude\" is not inappropriate'. They conclude that 'a number of animals perished for no discernible beneficial reason' and criticized the British Home Secretary for the fact that he 'failed to weigh adequately the likely benefit of the research against the likely adverse effects on the animals involved'. In some ways Feldberg was probably unlucky. I very much doubt if he was the only scientist in Britain who was failing to anaesthetize laboratory animals properly. He certainly wasn't the only scientist doing research work of negligible value. It's quite clear from this case history that it is a lie to say that animals which are experimented on are invariably and adequately anaesthetized. The truth is that most animals have no anaesthetic at all; and even when an anaesthetic is used the chances are high that it will be inadequate.\"\"\n\n"}
{"id": "49373387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49373387", "title": "Wollheim's paradox", "text": "Wollheim's paradox\n\nWollheim's paradox is a problem in political philosophy that points to an inherent contradiction in the concept of democracy. The paradox highlights the fact that a person can simultaneously advocate two conflicting policy options A and B, provided that the person believes that democratic decisions should be followed. The paradox was formulated by the British philosopher Richard Wollheim in 1962 in an article entitled \"A paradox in the theory of democracy\".\n\nIn his article, Wollheim describes a machine for making that compiles the votes of voters in such a way that the result invariably give the most democratic outcome. He also assumes that a voting person has preferences that enable them to prefer policy proposal A in front of B, and that the proposals are mutually exclusive. The person believes that Proposal A should be realized, and moreover that he should vote on the proposals he believes should be implemented. So he gives his vote to option A in the machine. Once the machine has tallied all votes, proposal B has received more votes than option A. Since the person is democratically minded, he believes now that the proposal that the democratic process has chosen should be realized, in this case B. So the person believes that both proposals A and B should be implemented, which is a contradiction.\n\nWollheim presents in his essay two ways to resolve the paradox, which he rejects.\n\nThe first strategy is based on the idea that the person does not really prefer A, but his preference should really be formulated as \"A, if the majority vote for it\". Wollheim rejects this formulation because it is about what result the machine gives, and not about what the person himself thinks of the two proposals. There is no distinction between \"A, if enough people vote as\" and \"B, if enough people vote so\". These preferences are equivalent to \"what result the machine gives\" meaning that the person concerned gives its consent to the democratic machine itself. But the machine's function assumes that it can compile the voters' preferences on different policy options. The machine cannot work without voters having preferences, yet the voters prefer the result of the machine over their own preferences.\n\nThe other solution that Wollheim rejects is that the person doesn't really prefer B, but rather consider it wise or tactically smart to accept the machine's result. The preference for B is of a different type from the moral-based preference for A, which means that the paradox is dissolved. The problem with this solution is that, while perhaps some people accept the machine's result because they think it is wise or tactically smart to do so, there are probably at least a few people who believe that there are moral reasons to accept the democratic decision of the machine. For these people, the paradox remains, and must be solved in a different way.\n\nWollheim sketches an analysis in which the paradox may not arise. He postulates two principles of moral values, \"direct\" and \"oblique\":\n\n\"Direct principles to the morality of actions, policies, motives, etc., where these are picked out or designated by means of some general descriptive expressions, e.g., murder, envy, benevolence, birth control, telling lies, etc. Oblique principles, by contrast, refer to the morality of actions, policies, motives, etc., where these actions, policies, motives, etc., are not picked out by reference to some common quality of characteristic that they possess, but are identified by means of an artificial property bestowed on them either as the result of an act of will of some individual or in consequence of the corporate actions of some institution.\n\nNow, my suggestion is that two judgements of the form 'A ought to be the case' and 'B ought to be the case' are not incompatible even though A and B cannot be simultaneously realized if one of these judgements is asserted as a direct principle whereas the other is asserted as a derivation from an oblique principle-provided that the direct and oblique principle are not themselves incompatible\".\n"}
