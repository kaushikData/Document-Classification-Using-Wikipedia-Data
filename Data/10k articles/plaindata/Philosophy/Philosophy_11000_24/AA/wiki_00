Ayer\n\nSir Alfred Jules \"Freddie\" Ayer, (; 29 October 1910 – 27 June 1989), usually cited as A. J. Ayer, was a British philosopher known for his promotion of logical positivism, particularly in his books \"Language, Truth, and Logic\" (1936) and \"The Problem of Knowledge\" (1956).\n\nHe was educated at Eton College and Oxford University, after which he studied the philosophy of logical positivism at the University of Vienna. From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford.\n\nDuring the Second World War Ayer was a Special Operations Executive and MI6 agent.\n\nHe was Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become Wykeham Professor of Logic at New College. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1951 to 1952 and knighted in 1970. He was known for his advocacy of humanism, and was the second President of the British Humanist Association (now known as Humanists UK).\n\nAyer was born in St John's Wood, in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe. His mother, Reine Citroën, was from the Dutch-Jewish family who founded the Citroën car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss Calvinist financier who worked for the Rothschild family.\n\nAyer was educated at Ascham St Vincent's School, a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of Eastbourne in Sussex, in which he started boarding at the comparatively early age of seven for reasons to do with the First World War, and Eton College, a boarding school in Eton (near Windsor) in Berkshire. It was at Eton that Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity. Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the Eton Wall Game very well. In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of corporal punishment at the school. He won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.\n\nAfter graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, \"Language, Truth and Logic\" in 1936. The first exposition in English of Logical Positivism as newly developed by the Vienna Circle, this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy. In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and MI6). Ayer was commissioned second lieutenant into the Welsh Guards from Officer Cadet Training Unit on 21 September 1940.\n\nAfter the war he briefly returned to Oxford University where he became a fellow and Dean of Wadham College. He thereafter taught philosophy at London University from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television. He was an extrovert and social mixer who liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of Tottenham Hotspur football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.\n\nAyer was married four times to three women. His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel) Renée (d. 1980), who subsequently married philosopher Stuart Hampshire, Ayer's friend and colleague. In 1960 he married Alberta Constance (Dee) Wells, with whom he had one son. Ayer's marriage to Wells was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married Vanessa Salmon, former wife of politician Nigel Lawson. She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried Dee Wells, who survived him. Ayer also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist Sheilah Graham Westbrook.\n\nFrom 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir Alfred held the Wykeham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford. He was knighted in 1970.\n\nAyer died on 27 June 1989. From 1980 to 1989, Ayer lived at 51 York Street, Marylebone, where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.\n\nIn \"Language, Truth and Logic\" (1936), Ayer presents the verification principle as the only valid basis for philosophy. Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like \"God exists\" or \"charity is good\" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored. Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry. The stance that a belief in \"God\" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism (for example, by Paul Kurtz). In later years Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God and began to refer to himself as an atheist. He followed in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell by debating with the Jesuit scholar Frederick Copleston on the topic of religion.\n\nAyer's version of emotivism divides \"the ordinary system of ethics\" into four classes:\nHe focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.\n\nAyer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition of non-empirical moral truths as \"worthless\" since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are \"mere pseudo-concepts\":\n\nBetween 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and George Orwell, he contributed a series of articles to \"Polemic\", a short-lived British \"Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics\" edited by the ex-Communist Humphrey Slater.\n\nAyer was closely associated with the British humanist movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded Julian Huxley as president of the British Humanist Association, a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited \"The Humanist Outlook\", a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. In addition he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nHe taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at Bard College in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer Fernando Sanchez, Ayer, then 77, confronted Mike Tyson who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model Naomi Campbell. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: \"Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world,\" to which Ayer replied: \"And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men\". Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out.\n\nIn 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, \"What I saw when I was dead\", describing an unusual near-death experience. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it \"slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be.\" However, a few days later he revised this, saying \"what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief\".\n\nIn 2001 Dr Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: \"I saw a Divine Being. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions.\" Ayer's son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.\n\nAyer is best known for popularising the verification principle, in particular through his presentation of it in \"Language, Truth, and Logic\" (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called Vienna Circle which Ayer visited as a young guest. Others, including the leading light of the circle, Moritz Schlick, were already offering their own papers on the issue. Ayer's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable empirical import, otherwise it is either \"analytical\" if tautologous, or \"metaphysical\" (i.e. meaningless, or \"literally senseless\"). He started to work on the book at the age of 23 and it was published when he was 26. Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and David Hume. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes \"Language, Truth and Logic\" essential reading on the tenets of logical empiricism– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century analytic philosophy, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour', an argument which anticipates the Turing test published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.\n\nAyer wrote two books on the philosopher Bertrand Russell, \"Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage\" (1971) and \"Russell\" (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of David Hume and a short biography of Voltaire.\n\nAyer was a strong critic of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. As a logical positivist Ayer was in conflict with Heidegger's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence. These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.\n\nIn 1972–1973 Ayer gave the Gifford Lectures at University of St Andrews, later published as \"The Central Questions of Philosophy\". In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord Gifford wished to promote \"natural theology\", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are \"able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth\". He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called \"philosophy\"– including the whole of metaphysics, theology and aesthetics– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.\n\nIn \"The Concept of a Person and Other Essays\" (1963), Ayer heavily criticized Wittgenstein's private language argument.\n\nAyer's sense-data theory in \"Foundations of Empirical Knowledge\" was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian J. L. Austin in \"Sense and Sensibilia\", a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay \"Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?\", which can be found in his \"Metaphysics and Common Sense\" (1969).\n\nHe was awarded a Knighthood as Knight Bachelor in the London Gazette on 1 January 1970.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Frege went on to employ his logical calculus in his research on the foundations of mathematics, carried out over the next quarter century.\n\nThe calculus contains the first appearance of quantified variables, and is essentially classical bivalent second-order logic with identity. It is bivalent in that sentences or formulas denote either True or False; second order because it includes relation variables in addition to object variables and allows quantification over both. The modifier \"with identity\" specifies that the language includes the identity relation, =.\n\nFrege presents his calculus using idiosyncratic two-dimensional notation: connectives and quantifiers are written using lines connecting formulas, rather than the symbols ¬, ∧, and ∀ in use today. For example, that judgement \"B\" materially implies judgement \"A\", i.e. formula_1 is written as .\n\nIn the first chapter, Frege defines basic ideas and notation, like proposition (\"judgement\"), the universal quantifier (\"the generality\"), the conditional, negation and the \"sign for identity of content\" formula_2 (which he used to indicate both material equivalence and identity proper); in the second chapter he declares nine formalized propositions as axioms.\n\nIn chapter 1, §5, Frege defines the conditional as follows:\n\n\nLet\nsignify that the third of those possibilities does not obtain, but one of the three others does. So if we negate , \nthat means the third possibility is valid, i.e. we negate A and assert B.\"\n\nFrege declared nine of his propositions to be axioms, and justified them by arguing informally that, given their intended meanings, they express self-evident truths. Re-expressed in contemporary notation, these axioms are:\n\n\nThese are propositions 1, 2, 8, 28, 31, 41, 52, 54, and 58 in the \"Begriffschrifft\". (1)–(3) govern material implication, (4)–(6) negation, (7) and (8) identity, and (9) the universal quantifier. (7) expresses Leibniz's indiscernibility of identicals, and (8) asserts that identity is a reflexive relation.\n\nAll other propositions are deduced from (1)–(9) by invoking any of the following inference rules:\n\nThe main results of the third chapter, titled \"Parts from a general series theory,\" concern what is now called the ancestral of a relation \"R\". \"\"a\" is an \"R\"-ancestor of \"b\" is written \"aR\"*\"b\".\n\nFrege applied the results from the \"Begriffsschrifft\", including those on the ancestral of a relation, in his later work \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\". Thus, if we take \"xRy\" to be the relation \"y\" = \"x\" + 1, then 0\"R\"*\"y\" is the predicate \"y\" is a natural number.\" (133) says that if \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" are natural numbers, then one of the following must hold: \"x\" < \"y\", \"x\" = \"y\", or \"y\" < \"x\". This is the so-called \"law of trichotomy\".\n\nFor a careful recent study of how the \"Begriffsschrift\" was reviewed in the German mathematical literature, see Vilko (1998). Some reviewers, especially Ernst Schröder, were on the whole favorable. All work in formal logic subsequent to the \"Begriffsschrift\" is indebted to it, because its second-order logic was the first formal logic capable of representing a fair bit of mathematics and natural language.\n\nSome vestige of Frege's notation survives in the \"turnstile\" symbol formula_17 derived from his \"Urteilsstrich\" (\"judging/inferring stroke\") │ and \"Inhaltsstrich\" (i.e. \"content stroke\") ──. Frege used these symbols in the \"Begriffsschrift\" in the unified form ├─ for declaring that a proposition is true. In his later \"Grundgesetze\" he revises slightly his interpretation of the ├─ symbol.\n\nIn \"Begriffsschrift\" the \"Definitionsdoppelstrich\" (i.e. \"definition double stroke\") │├─ indicates that a proposition is a definition. Furthermore, the negation sign formula_18 can be read as a combination of the horizontal \"Inhaltsstrich\" with a vertical negation stroke. This negation symbol was reintroduced by Arend Heyting in 1930 to distinguish intuitionistic from classical negation. It also appears in Gerhard Gentzen's doctoral dissertation.\n\nIn the \"Tractatus Logico Philosophicus\", Ludwig Wittgenstein pays homage to Frege by employing the term \"Begriffsschrift\" as a synonym for logical formalism.\n\nFrege's 1892 essay, \"On Sense and Reference,\" recants some of the conclusions of the \"Begriffsschrifft\" about identity (denoted in mathematics by the \"=\" sign). In particular, he rejects the \"Begriffsschrift\" view that the identity predicate expresses a relationship between names, in favor of the conclusion that it expresses a relationship between the objects that are denoted by those names.\n\n\"If the task of philosophy is to break the domination of words over the human mind [...], then my concept notation, being developed for these purposes, can be a useful instrument for philosophers [...] I believe the cause of logic has been advanced already by the invention of this concept notation.\" (Preface to the \"Begriffsschrift\")\n\n\nTranslations:\n\nSecondary literature:\n\n"}

{"id": "42371992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42371992", "title": "Dual consciousness", "text": "Dual consciousness\n\nDual consciousness is a theoretical concept in neuroscience. It is proposed that it is possible that a person may develop two separate conscious entities within their one brain after undergoing a corpus callosotomy. The idea first began circulating in the neuroscience community after some split-brain patients exhibited the alien hand syndrome, which led some scientists to believe that there must be two separate consciousnesses within the brain's left and right hemispheres in competition with one another once the corpus callosum is severed.\n\nThe idea of dual consciousness has caused controversy in the neuroscience community. It has not been conclusively proven or disproven.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th Century, some neurosurgeons concluded that the best option of treating severe epilepsy was by severing the patient's corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is the primary communication mechanism between the brain's two cerebral hemispheres. For example, communication across the callosum allows information from both the left and right visual fields to be interpreted by the brain in a way that makes sense to comprehend the person's actual experience (visual inputs from both eyes are interpreted by the brain to make sense of the experience that you are looking at a computer that is directly in front of you). The procedure of surgically removing the corpus callosum is called a corpus callosotomy. Patients who have undergone a corpus callosotomy are colloquially referred to as \"split-brain patients\". They are called so because now their brain's left and right hemispheres are no longer connected by the corpus callosum.\n\nSplit-brain patients have been subjects for numerous psychological experiments that sought to discover what occurs in the brain now that the primary interhemispheric pathways have been disrupted. Notable researchers in the field include Roger Sperry, one of the first to publish ideas involving a dual consciousness, and his famous graduate student, Michael Gazzaniga. Their results found a pattern amongst patients: severing the entire corpus callosum stops the interhemispheric transfer of perceptual, sensory, motor, and other forms of information. For most cases, corpus callosotomies did not in any way affect patients' real world functioning, however, those psychology experiments have demonstrated some interesting differences between split-brain patients and normal subjects.\n\nThe first successful corpus callosotomies on humans were performed in the 1930s. The purpose of the procedure was to alleviate the effects of epilepsy when other forms of treatment (medications) had failed to stop the violent convulsions associated with the disorder. Epileptic seizures occur because of abnormal electrical discharges that spread across areas of the brain. William Van Wagenen proposed the idea of severing the corpus callosum to eliminate transcortical electrical signals across the brain's hemispheres. If this could be achieved, then the seizures should be reduced or even completely eliminated.\n\nThe general procedure of a corpus callosotomy is as follows. The patient is put under anesthesia. Once the patient is in deep sleep, a craniotomy is performed. This procedure removes a section of the skull, leaving the brain exposed and accessible to the surgeon. The dura mater is pulled back so the deeper areas of the brain, including the corpus callosum, can be seen. Specialized instruments are placed into the brain that allows safe severing of the corpus. Initially, a partial callosotomy is performed, which only severs the front two thirds of the callosum. It is important to note that because the back section of the callosum is preserved, visual information is still sent across both hemispheres. Though the corpus callosum loses a majority of its functioning during a partial callosotomy, it does not completely lose its capabilities. If this operation does not succeed in reducing the seizures, a complete callosotomy is needed to reduce the severity of the seizures.\n\nA similar type of procedure, known as a commissurotomy, involves severing a number of interhemispheric tracts (such as the anterior commissure, the hippocampal commissure and the massa intermedia of the thalamus) in addition to the corpus callosum.\n\nAfter surgery, the split-brain patients are often given extensive neuropsychological assessments. An interesting finding among split-brain patients is many of them claim to feel normal after the surgery and do not feel that their brains are \"split\". The corpus callosotomy and commissurotomy have been successful in reducing, and in some cases, completely eliminating epileptic seizures. Van Wagenen's theory was correct.\n\nAlien hand syndrome, sometimes used synonymously with anarchic hand is a neurological disorder in which the afflicted person's hand appears to take on a mind of its own. Alien hand syndrome has been documented in some split brain patients.\n\nThe classic sign of Alien Hand Syndrome is that the affected person cannot control one of their hands. For example, if a split-brain patient with Alien Hand Syndrome is asked to pick up a glass with their right hand, as the right hand moves over to the glass, the left hand will interfere with the action, thwarting the right hand's task. The interference from the left hand is completely out of the control of the patient and is not being done “on purpose”. Affected patients at times cannot control the movements of their hands. Another example included patients unbuttoning a shirt with one hand, and the other hand simultaneously re-buttoning the shirt (although some reported feeling normal after their surgery).\n\nWhen scientists first started observing the alien hand syndrome in split-brain patients, they began to question the nature of consciousness and began to theorize that perhaps when the corpus callosum is cut, consciousness also is split into two separate entities. This development added to the general appeal of split-brain research.\n\nIn 1978, Michael Gazzaniga and Joseph DeLoux discovered a unique phenomenon among split-brain patients who were asked to perform a simultaneous concept task. The patient was shown 2 pictures: of a house in the winter time and of a chicken's claw. The pictures were positioned so they would exclusively be seen in only one visual field of the brain (the winter house was positioned so it would only be seen in the patient's left visual field (LVF), which corresponds to the brain's right hemisphere, and the chicken's claw was placed so it would only be seen in the patient's right visual field (RVF), which corresponds to the brain's left hemisphere.\n\nA series of pictures was placed in front of the patients. Gazzaniga and LeDoux then asked the patient to choose a picture with his right hand and a picture with his left hand. The paradigm was set up so the choices would be obvious for the patients. A snow shovel is used for shoveling the snowy driveway of the winter house and a chicken's head correlates to the chicken's claw. The other pictures do not in any way correlate with the 2 original pictures. In the study, a patient chose the snow shovel with his left hand (corresponding to his brain's right hemisphere) and his right hand chose the chicken's head (corresponding to the brain's left hemisphere). When the patient was asked why he had chosen the pictures he had chosen, the answer he gave was “The chicken claw goes with the chicken head, and you need a snow shovel to clean out the chicken shed”.\n\nWhy would he say this? Wouldn't it be obvious that the shovel goes with the winter house? For people with an intact corpus callosum, yes it is obvious, but not for a split-brain patient. Both the winter house and the shovel are being projected to the patient from his LVF, so his right hemisphere is receiving and processing the information and this input is completely independent from what is going on in the RVF, which involves the chicken's claw and head (the information being processed in the left hemisphere). The human brain's left hemisphere is primarily responsible interpreting the meaning of the sensory input it receives from both fields, however the left hemisphere has no knowledge of the winter house. Because it has no knowledge of the winter house, it must invent a logical reason for why the shovel was chosen. Since the only objects it has to work with are the chicken's claw and head, the left hemisphere interprets the meaning of choosing the shovel as “it is an object necessary to help the chicken, which lives in a shed, therefore, the shovel is used to clean the chicken’s shed”. Gazzaniga famously coined the term left brain interpreter to explain this phenomenon.\n\nWhat does the results of Gazzaniga and LeDoux's work suggest about the existence of a dual consciousness? There are varying possibilities.\n\n\nThe Gazzaniga-LeDoux studies were based off previous studies done by Sperry-Gazzaniga. Sperry examined split-brain patients. Sperry's experiment included a subject being seated at a table, with a shield blocking the visions from the subject's hands, including the objects on the table and the examiner seated across. The shield was also used as a viewing screen. On the shield, the examiner can select to present the visual material to both hemispheres or to selective hemispheres by means of having the patient look at certain points on the viewing screen. The patient is briefly exposed to the stimuli on the viewing screen. The stimuli shown to the left eye goes to the right hemisphere and the visual material shown to the right eye will be projected to the left hemisphere. During the experiment, when the stimulus was shown to the left side of the screen, the patient indicated he did not see anything. Patients have shown the inability to describe in writing or in speech the stimuli that was shown briefly to left side. The speaking hemisphere, which in most people is the left hemisphere, would not have awareness of stimulus being shown to the right hemisphere (left visual field), except the left hand was able to point to the correct object. Based off his observations and data, Sperry concluded each hemisphere possessed its own consciousness.\n\nRevonsuo explains a procedure that was similar in nature to the Sperry-Gazzaniga design. Split-brain patients are shown a picture with two objects: a flower and a rabbit. The flower is exclusively shown in the right visual field, which is interpreted by the left hemisphere and the rabbit is exclusively shown in the left visual field, which is interpreted by the right hemisphere. The left brain is seeing the flower as the right brain is simultaneously viewing the rabbit. When the patients were asked what they saw, patients said they only saw the flower and did not see the rabbit. The flower is in the right visual field and the left hemisphere can only see the flower. The left hemisphere dominates the interpretation of the stimulus and since it cannot see the rabbit (only being represented in the right hemisphere), patients do not believe they saw a rabbit. They can, however, still point to the rabbit with their left hand. Revonsuo stated that it seemed that one consciousness saw the flower and another consciousness saw the rabbit independently from one another.\n\nRhawn Joseph observed two patients who had both undergone a complete corpus callosotomy. Joseph observed that one of the patient's right hemisphere is able to gather, comprehend, and express information. The right hemisphere was able to direct activity to the patient's left arm and leg. The execution of the left arm and leg's action as was inhibited by the left hemisphere. Joseph found that the patient's left leg would attempt to move forward as if to walk straight but the right leg would either refuse move or begin to walk in the opposite direction. After observing the struggles of the execution of activities involving the left and right arms and legs, led Joseph to believe that the two hemispheres possessed their own consciousness.\n\nJoseph also noted that the patient had other specific instances of conflict between the right and left hemispheres including, the left hand (right hemisphere) carrying out actions contrary to the left hemisphere's motives such as the left hand turning off the television immediately after the right hand turned it on. Joseph found that the patient's left leg would only allow the patient to return home when the patient was going for a walk and would reject continuing to go for that walk.\n\nIn the laboratory, a patient was given two different fabrics: a wire screen in his left hand and a piece of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the left hand, he was able to correctly indicate and point with the left hand to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his left hand, however, the right hand tried to stop the left hand and make the left hand point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The left hand continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the left hand. During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”. Joseph concluded that the left hemisphere did not understand at all why the left hand (right hemisphere) would point to a different material.\n\nProponents of the dual consciousness theory have caused a great amount of controversy and debate within the neuroscience community. The magnitude of such a claim: that consciousness can be split into two entities within the one brain are considered by some scientists to be audacious. There is no concrete evidence to validate the theory and the current evidence provided is, at best, anecdotal.\n\nThe most powerful claims against the dual consciousness theory are:\n\n\nGonzalo Munevar has proposed an alternative explanation to demonstrate that these strange behaviors are spawned from areas in the brain and not by a dual consciousness. Two cortical areas in particular, the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex, are crucial in the planning of executing motor tasks to external stimuli presented in the person's perceptual field. For example, a person may pick up a glass of water with his right hand and put it up to his lips for a drink. The person may have picked up the glass with his right hand, but well before this action takes place, the PMC and SMA consider a variety of different possibilities of how this action could be performed. He could have picked it up with his left hand, his mouth, even his foot! He could have done it quickly or slowly. Many possibilities are entertained, but few are actually executed. These actions are sent from the PMC to the Motor Cortex for execution. The rest are inhibited by the SMA and are not performed.\n\nIt is also important to understand that the processes of the SMA and PMC are done unconsciously. The SMA and PMC consider the many alternative actions many milliseconds before the chosen action takes place. The person is never consciously aware of these alternative possibilities the brain has juggled with before he picks it up with the right hand; he just does it. The action of picking up the glass with the right hand is also performed unconsciously. It may be preferable to use his right hand because he is right handed and doing so is therefore more comfortable or perhaps the glass is placed on his right side and the possibility that expends the least amount of energy is using the right hand to pick it up.\n\nAnother important fact about the PMC is that its activation is bilateral. When it is activated, it is activated in both hemispheres of the brain. Gazzaniga observed and wrote about this phenomenon. When the corpus callosum is severed, many interhemispheric interactions are disrupted. Many areas of the brain become compromised, including the SMA. If the SMA has trouble regulating and inhibiting the actions of the PMC, it is very possible that conflicting sets of actions may be sent to the MC and performed (accounting for both hands reaching for the glass, even if only one hand is intended to grab it). It would make the appearance that there is a dual consciousness competing for dominance over the other for control of the brain, but it is not the case.\n\nThe fact that the Alien Hand Syndrome eventually goes away in some split-brain patients is not evidence of one consciousness “defeating” the other and taking complete control of the brain. It is likely that the plasticity of the brain may be the cause for alleviating the disorder. Eventually the split patient's brain may find adaptive routes to compensate for the lost interhemispheric communication, such as alternative pathways involving subcortical structures that perform subcortical interhemispheric inhibition to regain a sense of normalcy between the two hemispheres.\n\nMichael Gazzaniga, while working on the model of dual consciousness, came to the conclusion that simple dual consciousness (i.e. right-brain/left-brain model of the mind) is a gross oversimplification and the brain is organized into hundreds maybe even thousands of modular-processing systems.\n\nThe theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by Carl Jung in 1935 when he stated, \"The so-called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not.\"\n\nSimilar models (which also claim that mind is formed from many little agents, i.e. the brain is made up of a constellation of independent or semi-independent agents) were also described by:\n\n"}

This is typically described as following the imposition of martial law in the United States after a major disaster or crisis. In some versions of the theory, only suspected dissidents will be imprisoned. In more extreme versions, large numbers of US citizens will be imprisoned for the purposes of extermination as a New World Order is established.\n\nThe conspiracy theory has existed since the late 1970s but it has picked up greatly in popularity with the advent of the internet and social media platforms.\n\nFEMA is a United States government agency tasked with the effective management of major emergencies within the country, including ensuring the continuity of government during a large-scale disaster such as a nuclear war. It provides federal relief to areas afflicted by natural disasters.\n\nThe precursor agency to FEMA was the Federal Civil Defense Administration established by President Harry S. Truman in 1950 pursuant to executive order #10186.\n\nFEMA was established in 1979 under executive order by President Jimmy Carter. It was established to coordinate the response to a major disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms local and state authorities.\n\nIn 2002 it was finally codified into law and made a component of the Department of Homeland Security. As well as providing large-scale emergency-management, FEMA is also the largest flood-insurer in the United States, mainly because most private insurance companies don't offer flood-insurance.\n\nProponents of the conspiracy theory argue FEMA's mission is a cover up for real purpose — to assume control of the United States following a major disaster or threat — and that the organization is 'the executive arm of the coming police state'.\n\nThe theory in general states that once a disaster or threat of one comes into being, martial law will be declared and FEMA's emergency powers will come into operation. It will effectively be the government. The constitution will be suspended, and citizens will be moved into camps.\n\nIn many versions, 'dissidents' (typically defined as constitutionalists/patriots etc...) will merely be imprisoned. Others have gone so far as to argue that they will be sent to these camps to be murdered.\n\nExtreme versions state that plans are in place to imprison and kill apolitical American citizens in camps as part of a 'population control' plot. In April 2014 Snopes posted a claim that FEMA was marking houses by political affiliation to round people up for these camps. In reality the bright, color coded stickers serve varying purposes for newspaper and mail delivery personnel.\n\nAlthough they do not mention FEMA specifically, the Oath Keepers list of 10 \"Orders We Will Not Obey,\" contains many of the fears shared by proponents of FEMA conspiracies.\n\nProponents often play into racial fear, asserting that FEMA will use 'urban gangs' as auxiliaries to ensure order.\n\nFEMA conspiracies are often worked in larger conspiracy narratives about ushering in a 'New World Order', meaning a totalitarian global government.\n\nOne of the first known references to FEMA concentration camps comes from a newsletter issued by Posse Comitatus in 1982, with the warning that 'hardcore patriots' were to be detained in them. The prevalence of the conspiracy theory increased in line with the rise of the militia movement in the 1990s.\n\nThe conspiracy was part of the rhetoric of the now largely disbanded Militia of Montana. The self-styled congressional analyst David Fletcher was their spokesman and brought it up in meetings, even pointing out \"United Nations Reserves\" that the government was building concentration camps for in the Northern Cascades.\n\nA supposed FEMA camp was featured in Linda Thompson's 1994 film \"America Under Siege\" (in reality, the 'FEMA camp' was an Amtrak repair facility). She accused the government of using \"black helicopters\" against patriots to prevent them from interfering with plans to establish a \"New World Order\".\n\nFollowing the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the conspiracy theory was discussed by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Domestic Terrorism.\n\nThe theory's inclusion in the plot of the 1998 X-Files movie showed its growing reach.\n\nFears of FEMA declined in the early 2000s as foreign terrorists were perceived as the major threat but the late-2000s recession and the election of Barack Obama had renewed opposition among conservatives to the federal government. Obama's election also enabled the theory to reach more mainstream right-wing circles whereas it had previously been confined to the fringes. There was a resurgence in the militia movement and with it a resurgence of the FEMA camps conspiracy theory and a corresponding boom in the \"prepper\" economy.\n\nEmails from the magazine \"National Review\" have also promoted the theory.\n\nCongresswoman Michele Bachmann alluded to the theory while in office, as have other Republican Party politicians.\n\nIn December 2011 Camille Marino of the hard-left animal liberation website Negotiation is Over posted an alert on her website titled \"Military Now Recruiting Guards for FEMA Domestic Detainment/Internment Camps.\" containing the usual warnings about the end of civil liberties and the announcement that the U.S. Army is looking for \"a Few Good Totalitarians\" to herd dissenters into camps.\n\nIn 2015, fears of the FEMA roundup beginning surfaced with the announcement of a domestic military training operation called Jade Helm 15.County and state officials in Texas denounced the fears and the exercise was completed with no one being placed into an internment camp.\n\nAlso in 2015 additional speculation about the theory was stoked by retired general Wesley Clark when he called for World War II-style internment camps to be revived to combat Muslim extremism. He stated, \"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right. It’s our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.\"\n\nWith the end of Obama's presidency and the 2016 election approaching conspiracy theories (including the FEMA death camp idea) were heavily promoted by many on the right, from Alex Jones to Donald Trump. In February 2016 right wing radio host Rick Wiles went so far as to state a belief that Obama murdered Antonin Scalia to remove the last impediment to shredding the constitution and starving people into FEMA death camps.\n\nAccording to the Las Vegas Police Department and witnesses in the weeks leading up to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting gunman Stephen Paddock reportedly espoused right-wing anti-government and conspiratorial views, including FEMA conspiracies. He reportedly told a friend that \"sometimes, sacrifices have to be made\" in order to encourage the American public to arm themselves.\n\n\"Popular Mechanics\" has published a debunking of some of the various claims proponents of the theory make and FOX News personality Glenn Beck did a 2009 interview with James Meigs, editor-in-chief there, where he walked through a debunking of one purported camp. \"This video,\" Meigs said, \"actually dates from about 1995. But like so many of these conspiracy theories, it gets re-cut and re-edited and circulated around the Internet.\"\n\nBloggers at the Skeptic Project have posted detailed lists where they claim to debunk many of the FEMA camp locations in the U.S. elsewhere.\n\nNewsweek emailed FEMA to inquire about the FEMA camps rumors. Press Secretary Alexa Lopez replied, \"We are currently focusing our efforts on providing assistance to disaster survivors, and the ongoing response and recovery efforts in Louisiana. As to your first question, over the years there have been many myths or rumors surrounding FEMA, and I am glad I have the chance to set the record straight with you. There is absolutely no truth to these rumors—they are nothing more than conspiracy theories.\"\n\nHowever, an internal FEMA memo shows the agency brass understands the nature of trying quell the conspiracies, \"Most people know us as the agency that responds to natural disasters. Others believe we have a somewhat sinister role. For the latter, it is not realistic to think that we can convince them otherwise and it is advisable not to enter into debate on the subject.\"\n\nProponents have cited a contingency plan (Rex 84) drafted in part by Oliver North calling for the suspension of the Constitution and the detainment of citizens in the event of a national crisis. This was aimed at left-wing activists, not the libertarians and right-wingers generally associated with FEMA theories. This has been linked to a 1970 document by Louis Giuffrida (years later, the director of FEMA) calling for the establishment of martial law in the event of an uprising by African American militants and the internment of millions of African Americans.\n\nConspiracy theorists have used the actual internment of Japanese Americans during World War II in specifically constructed camps as evidence that such a scenario at least has historic precedent. Similarly, the forced removal of Native Americans from their lands is an earlier precedent.\n\n"}

It is a practice that has been recommended by Catholic leaders and saints as a powerful means of growing in love with God, in humility, and having sorrow for sins, since it is considered a personal encounter with Jesus who is the source of God's grace, help, and forgiveness. \n\nA recommended frequency, based on the teachings of the Pope and Catholic Church law, is between once a month and once a week.\n\nThis practice \"was introduced into the Church by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\", according to Pius XII. Confession of everyday faults is \"strongly recommended by the Church\", according to the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" 1458. Paul VI said that frequent confession is \"of great value\". According to the study of Sal Ferigle of Church law and teachings, \"whenever possible, frequent confession will ordinarily mean between once a month and once a week.\"\n\nMany Lutheran Churches also encourage going to frequent Holy Absolution, and follow similar teachings as Roman Catholics on frequent confession.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that everyone is called to sanctity, since man was created to love and serve God, the ultimate source of man's happiness. For this, God has given the sacraments as God's way of giving divine life to each person. \n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches:\n\nPaul VI who presided over the Second Vatican Council taught that frequent confession is \"of great value\". \n\nJohn Paul II who went to confession weekly, said:\n\nIn his Apostolic Exhortation, \"Reconcilatio et Paenitentia\", St. John Paul II also encouraged frequent confession even if only of venial sins: \n\nThe advantages of frequent confession was discussed by Pius XII. He said that \"the pious practice of frequent Confession which was introduced into the Church by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit [is] to be earnestly advocated.\"\n\nPius XII, who went to confession daily, explained that by frequent confession: \n\nHe then warned those \"who make light of or lessen esteem for frequent Confession know what they are doing. What they are doing is alien to the spirit of Christ and disastrous for the Mystical Body of Christ.\" \n\nBenedict Baur's book, \"Frequent Confession\" is a classic in explaining the advantages of frequent confession:\n\nJohn Paul II also enumerated these:\n\nHe said those who discourage frequent confession \"are lying.\"\n\nAccording to Rev. Fr. Sal Ferigle, \"For those who sincerely wish to do their best to avail themselves of the opportunity of frequent confession in order to grow spiritually, frequent confession will ordinarily be linked to having a fixed confessor. The confessor will be the best qualified person to suggest the frequency suited to the spiritual development and the physical and moral possibilities of the penitent. \n\nWithin those rather broad limits of flexibility and to seek a general rule of common sense, we can refer to [Paul VI's General Audiences] which speaks about 'receiving the Sacrament of Penance frequently, that is twice a month.' Previous legislation which specified regular intervals for confession spoke about weekly confession. One can therefore say in general terms that, whenever possible, frequent confession will ordinarily mean between once a month and once a week.\"\n\n\n"}

Registry managers will often not divulge who has purchased the registered items. In the United Kingdom, a gift registry is frequently referred to as a \"gift list\" and has become an established part of British weddings, with the service often provided by most department stores.\nTraditionally, registries were limited to the stock of a given retailer, which maintained the list for the registrant and ensured that items were removed from the list as they were purchased. \n\nHowever, online gift registries that are not specific to any retailer have become an increasingly popular alternative to retailer-specific registries, as the former offers more flexible means of adding gifts and coordinating purchases, as well as social networking capabilities. In 2004, North American shopping centers (notably Galleria Edina) began to extend this concept by offering registries that had access to multiple shops within individual centers.\n\nA managed registry system has several goals:\n\nGift registries are often used for a variety of occasions, such as anniversaries, baby showers, birthdays, civil ceremonies, graduations, and housewarming parties. \n"}

It is the primary method of interpretation for many conservative Protestant exegetes who reject the historical-critical method to various degrees (from the complete rejection of historical criticism of some fundamentalist Protestants to the moderated acceptance of it in the Roman Catholic tradition since Pope Pius XII), in contrast to the overwhelming reliance on historical-critical interpretation, often to the exclusion of all other hermeneutics, in liberal Christianity.\n\nThe Orthodox Church primarily employs a spiritual, allegorizing hermeneutic heavily dependent on typological connections drawn by New Testament writers and the church fathers of the first several centuries of Christianity. The Roman Catholic Church divides hermeneutic into four senses: the literal, allegorical, moral, and anagogical; however, interpretation is always subject to the Church's magisterium. The process for determining the original meaning of the text is through examination of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre as well as theological (canonical) considerations. \nThe historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning of the text and its significance. The significance of the text is essentially the application or contextualization of the principles from text.\n\nThe aim of the historical-grammatical method is to discover the meaning of the passage as the original author would have intended and what the original hearers would have understood. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As Milton S. Terry said, \"A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture.\"\n\nMany practice the historical-grammatical method using the inductive method, a general three-fold approach to the text: observation, interpretation, and application. Each step builds upon the other, which follows in order. The first step of observation involves an examination of words, structure, structural relationships and literary forms. After observations are formed, then the second step of interpretation involves asking interpretative questions, formulating answers to those questions, integration and summarization of the passage. After the meaning is derived through interpretation, the third step of application involves determining both the theoretical and practical significance of the text and appropriately applying this significance to today's modern context. There is also a heavy emphasis on personal application that extends into all aspects of the practitioner's life. Theologian Robert Traina, in his 1952 \"Methodical Bible Study\", wrote that \"the applicatory step is that for which all else exists. It represents the final purpose of Bible study.\"\n\nTechnically speaking, the grammatical-historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage's significance in light of that interpretation. Together, interpretation of the passage and determining the meaning define the term \"hermeneutics.\"\n\nIn the reader-response method, the focus is on how the book is perceived by the reader, not on the intention of the author. Those who regard the text as divinely inspired and seek to determine the intention of the divine author tend to stay away from this method because of the many interpretations, often contrary to scripture, arising from a reader response of the text without any formal foundation of the text.\n\nThe historical-critical method is used by many academic Bible scholars in universities, including many Roman Catholic and Protestant institutions. The method uses higher criticism, in an attempt to discover the sources and factors that contributed to the making of the text as well as to determine what it meant to the original audience. Scholars who use the historical-critical method treat the Bible as they would any other text. Historical-critical scholars as such are also typically less interested in determining what the text means for people today. For those reasons, some traditional scholars and conservative Christians tend to reject the method, but even many of them use aspects of it that naturally overlap with the historical-grammatical method, such as attempting to determine what was meant when the passage in question was written.\n\n\n"}

Organized every autumn by the Warsaw-based OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the meeting is considered to be Europe's largest human rights conference.\n\nThe Human Dimension Implementation Meeting (HDIM) was established in the early 1990s to create a forum for participating States of the OSCE to discuss the implementation of the \"human dimension\" commitments they have adopted by consensus at prior Summits and Ministerial Meetings.

Historian Jim Powell has called Paterson one of the three founding mothers of American libertarianism, along with Rose Wilder Lane and Ayn Rand, who both acknowledged an intellectual debt to Paterson. Paterson's best-known work, \"The God of the Machine\" (1943), a treatise on political philosophy, economics, and history, reached conclusions and espoused beliefs that many libertarians credit as a foundation of their philosophy. Her biographer Stephen D. Cox (2004) believes Paterson was the \"earliest progenitor of libertarianism as we know it today.\" In a letter of 1943, Rand wrote that \"\"The God of the Machine\" is a document that could literally save the world ... \"The God of the Machine\" does for capitalism what \"Das Kapital\" does for the Reds and what the Bible did for Christianity.\"\n\nBorn Isabel Mary Bowler in rural Manitoulin Island, Ontario, she moved with her family to the west when she was very young. She grew up on a cattle ranch in Alberta. Paterson's family was quite poor and she had eight siblings. A voracious reader who was largely self-educated, she had brief and informal public schooling during these years: about three years in a country school, from the ages of 11 to 14. In her late teen years, Bowler left the ranch for the city of Calgary, where she took a clerical job with the Canadian Pacific Railway. As a teenager, she worked as a waitress, stenographer, and bookkeeper, working at one point as an assistant to future Canadian Prime Minister R. B. Bennett.\n\nThis hardscrabble youth probably led Paterson to attach great importance to productive \"self-starters\". Although she was articulate, well-read, and erudite, Paterson had extremely limited formal education, an experience she shared with Rose Wilder Lane, who was also Paterson's friend and correspondent for many years.\n\nIn 1910, at the age of 24, Bowler entered into a short-lived marriage with Canadian Kenneth B. Paterson. The marriage was not happy, and they parted in 1918. It was during these years, in a foray south of the border, that Paterson landed a job with a newspaper, the \"Inland Herald\" in Spokane, Washington. Initially she worked in the business department of the paper, but later transferred to the editorial department. There her journalistic career began. Her next position was with a newspaper in Vancouver, British Columbia, where for two years she wrote drama reviews.\n\nIn 1914, Paterson started submitting her first two novels, \"The Magpie's Nest\" and \"The Shadow Riders,\" to publishers, without much success. It was not until 1916 that her second novel \"The Shadow Riders\" was accepted and published by John Lane Company, which also published \"The Magpie's Nest\" the following year in 1917.\n\nAfter World War I, she moved to New York City, where she worked for the sculptor Gutzon Borglum. He was creating statues for the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine and would later carve the memorial at Mount Rushmore. Paterson also wrote for the \"World\" and the \"American\" in New York.\n\nIn 1921, Paterson became an assistant to Burton Rascoe, the new literary editor of the \"New York Tribune\", later the \"New York Herald Tribune\". For 25 years, from 1924 to 1949, she wrote a column (signed \"I.M.P.\") for the \"Herald Tribune's\" \"Books\" section. Paterson became one of the most influential literary critics of her time. She covered a time of great expansion in the United States literary world, with new work by the rising generation of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and many others, African Americans of the Harlem Renaissance, as well as the first American generation of the great waves of European immigrants. Her friends during this period included the famous humorist Will Cuppy. In 1928 she became an American citizen, at the age of 42.\n\nShe was notorious for demonstrating her sharp wit and goring of sacred cows in her column, where she also first articulated many of the political ideas that reached their final form in \"The God of the Machine\". Her thinking, especially on free trade, was also foreshadowed in her historical novels of the 1920s and 1930s. Paterson opposed most of the economic program known as the New Deal, which American president Franklin D. Roosevelt put into effect during the Great Depression. She advocated less government involvement in both social and fiscal issues.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Paterson led a group of younger writers, many of them other \"Herald Tribune\" employees, who shared her views. One was future \"Time\" magazine correspondent and editor Sam Welles.\n\nAnother was the young Ayn Rand. From their many discussions, Paterson is credited with adding to Rand's knowledge of American history and government, and Rand with contributing ideas to \"The God of the Machine\". Paterson believed Rand's ethics to be a unique contribution, writing to Rand in the 1940s, \"You still don't seem to know yourself that your idea is \"new\". It is not Nietzsche or Max Stirner... Their supposed Ego was composed of whirling words – your concept of the Ego is an entity, a person, a living creature functioning in concrete reality.\"\n\nPaterson and Rand promoted each other's books and conducted an extensive correspondence over the years, in which they often touched on religion and philosophy. An atheist, Rand was critical of the deist Paterson's attempts to link capitalism with religion. Rand believed the two to be incompatible, and the two argued at length. Their correspondence ended after they quarreled in 1948. During a visit to Rand at her home in California, Paterson's remarks about writer Morrie Ryskind and abrasive behavior toward businessman William C. Mullendore, other guests of Rand, resulted in Rand's disillusionment with \"Pat.\"\n\nSimilarly, Paterson had broken with another friend and political ally, Rose Wilder Lane, in 1946.\n\nAs a sign of the political tenor of the times, \"The God of the Machine\" was published in the same year as Rand's novel \"The Fountainhead\" and Rose Wilder Lane's \"The Discovery of Freedom\". Writer Albert Jay Nock wrote that Lane's and Paterson's nonfiction books were \"the only intelligible books on the philosophy of individualism that have been written in America this century.\" The two women had \"shown the male world of this period how to think fundamentally... They don't fumble and fiddle around – every shot goes straight to the centre.\" Journalist John Chamberlain credits Paterson, Lane and Rand with his final \"conversion\" from socialism to what he called \"an older American philosophy\" of libertarian and conservative ideas. Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Paterson, Lane, and Rand to be the three most important women of modern American libertarianism.\n\nPaterson further influenced the post-WWII rise of lettered American conservatism through her correspondence with the young Russell Kirk in the 1940s, and with the young William F. Buckley in the 1950s. Buckley and Kirk went on to found the \"National Review,\" to which Paterson contributed for a brief time. However, she sometimes sharply differed from Buckley, for example by disagreeing with the magazine's review of Rand's novel, \"Atlas Shrugged\".\n\nIn her retirement, Paterson declined to enroll in Social Security and kept her Social Security card in an envelope with words \"'Social Security' Swindle\" written on it.\n\nPaterson died on January 10, 1961, and was interred in the Welles family plot at Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard in Burlington, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1996, he has been Research Professor at the National Research Council of Spain (CSIC). He is a fellow of the Center for Philosophy of Science in Pittsburgh and a member of several international academies. He has played a crucial role in the introduction of mathematical logic, analytical philosophy and philosophy of science in Spain and Latin America. Besides his academic duties, he has fulfilled important functions in the international publishing industry, especially in the Salvat and Hachette groups. He was actively involved in the protection of wildlife and its defense in the mass media. He died the 4th of October, 2017 from pleural mesothelioma, caused by exposure to asbestos.\n\nMosterín acquired his initial logical formation at the Institut für mathematische Logik und Grundlagenforschung in Münster (Germany). He published the first modern and rigorous textbooks of logic and set theory in Spanish. He has worked on topics of first and second order logic, axiomatic set theory, computability and complexity. He has shown how the uniform digitalization of each type of symbolic object (such as chromosomes, texts, pictures, movies or pieces of music) can be considered to implement a certain positional numbering system. This result gives a precise meaning to the notion that the set of natural numbers constitutes a universal library and indeed a universal data base. Mosterín has edited the first edition of the complete works of Kurt Gödel in any language. Together with Thomas Bonk, he has edited an unpublished book of Rudolf Carnap on axiomatics (in German). He has also delved in the historical and biographical aspects of the development of modern logic, as shown in his original work on the lives of Gottlob Frege, Georg Cantor, Bertrand Russell, John von Neumann, Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing, intertwined with a formal analysis of their main technical contributions.\n\nKarl Popper tried to establish a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned with the question of the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes the best we can do is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, and use it as a model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.\n\nBesides actively participating in the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, as long as we do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.\n\nThe role of our scientific image of the universe in a rational world view has always caught the attention of Mosterín. He has devoted much work to the epistemic analysis of cosmological theories and of the reliability of their claims. Together with John Earman, he has undertaken a thorough critical review of the paradigm of cosmic inflation. Earman and Mosterín conclude that, despite the widespread influence of the inflationary paradigm and the fact that it does not contradict any known results, there are as yet no good grounds for admitting any of the models of inflation into the standard core of scientific cosmology. He has also dealt with the role of speculation in cosmology. In particular, Mosterín has shown the multiple misunderstandings underlying the so-called anthropic principle and the use of anthropic explanations in cosmology. Mosterín concludes that \"in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation\". Mosterín also points to the flawed “anthropic” inferences from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:\n\nKant had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist Jesús Mosterín makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy. Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform. Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to logical consistency and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other. Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one’s best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible. Practical rationality has also a formal component, that reduces to Bayesian decision theory, and a material component, rooted in human nature (lastly, in our genome).\n\nMosterín’s interest in wildlife led to an early collaboration with Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente, the famous Spanish naturalist and documentary director, for promoting public awareness and appreciation of wild nature; this included the successful \"Fauna\" Encyclopedia. Opposed to all spectacles of cruelty, Mosterín has taken a firm stand against bullfighting. He contributed decisively to the discussion leading to the ban of bullfights in Catalonia (Spain) in 2010. Subsequently, he has published two books analyzing this cruel tradition and offering a devastating refutation of all proposed attempts to justify it. As honorary president of the Spanish Great Ape Project, he has cooperated with Peter Singer in advocating certain minimal legal rights for great apes. While firmly rejecting all forms of gross cruelty to animals, Mosterín has adopted a realist point of view in the controversies about the use of animals in research and nutrition, taking into account the various dimensions of the problems and insisting in the implementation of obligatory standards of animal welfare. He proposes the elimination of unnecessary and painful experiments, the abolition of factory farming based on confinement that prevents animals from displaying their genetically programmed behavior, and stopping the specially destructive and cruel forms of commercial fisheries like bottom trawling. In as far as meat continues to be eaten in the future, Mosterín suggests that the steaks could be grown in vitro from stem cells.\n\nAs a moral philosopher, Mosterín does not believe in the existence of intrinsic or natural rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but he thinks that any political society can create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with the role played by perception in empirical science.\n\nModern liberal democracy is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed a vigorous revival of the idea of human nature in the hands of authors like Edward Wilson, Steven Pinker and Jesús Mosterín. The successful sequencing of the human genome and the ongoing research on the function of genes and of regulatory sequences, together with the insights on the workings of the brain, have brought a new actuality and significance to this classical notion. According to Mosterín, the nature of our species \"Homo sapiens\" is the information genetically transmitted and present in the human genome (in the genetic pool). Your individual nature lies in your own genome, present in the chromosomes of your cells. The human genome has a layered structure and (up to a point) recapitulates the history of our human lineage. The oldest and deepest strata of our nature represent the living functions common to all life on Earth. Subsequent strata reflect later novelties. The newest layers are devoted to the most recent acquisitions, like bipedalism, grip of precision, large brain cortex, language and other abstract or recursive cognitive processes. Mosterín has dealt with the methods and criteria for distinguishing natural from cultural aspects of human capacities and behaviors and has provided a solid basis to theoretical anthropology. He has also engaged in the discussion and clarification of bioethical issues, like research with embryonic stem cells, birth control, abortion and euthanasia, taking always a scientific point of view and a position in favor of human freedom.\n\nBuilding on the wide understanding of culture brought about by cultural anthropology, archeology and biology, Mosterín has developed a new philosophical understanding of what culture is, where it is localized and how it evolves in time. Human nature is information, and so is human culture, but both are distinguished by their different means of transmission: whereas nature is transmitted genetically and is encoded in the genome, culture is transmitted through social learning and is encoded in the brain. Only individuals have a brain, and only they have a culture. Talk of collective cultures has to be understood as a statistical artifact for talking about a plurality of individual cultures. The set of elementary chunks of culture (variously known as memes, cultural variants or cultural traits) codified as neuronal circuits in the long term memory of the individual make up that individual’s culture. Corresponding to the different uses of ‘culture’ in ordinary and scientific language, Mosterín defines several notions of collective culture, going from the cultural pool (the union of the cultures of all individuals of the group) to the unanimous culture (the intersection of all those cultures). In 2009 he has completed a thoroughgoing analysis of the forces driving cultural change, paying special attention to the role of Internet and other factors of information technology. He considers that preserving the freedom and efficiency of Internet is crucial for the future thriving of human culture.\n\nAn admirer of the freshness and clarity of Bertrand Russell’s \"History of Western Philosophy\", whose foreword he composed, as well as a critic of some of its shortcomings, Mosterín has undertaken the ambitious plan of writing all by himself a universal history of thought, not only Western, but also Asian and even Archaic. His series of books on \"Historia del Pensamiento\" aims at covering all main intellectual traditions from an interdisciplinary approach dealing simultaneously with developments in philosophy, science and ideology. The analysis of the ideas is critical and uncompromising, combining rigor with clarity and straightforward language. Besides, he delves into the arguments and does not hesitate to dig out their eventual flaws.\n\nSome of the books of the series are devoted, for example, to Archaic thought, Aristotle and the philosophy of India. The examination of Archaic thought delves mainly into the intellectual contributions of old Mesopotamia, well documented in the cuneiform texts. Aristotle is presented not only as a philosopher, but also as a seminal scientist in different fields. The volume on India, besides dealing with linguistics and mathematics, contains a compact presentation of the main philosophical schools, from the Upanishad, through the Jaina and Buddhist developments, to the Advaita Vedanta of Shankara, which obviously attracts the author.\n\nThe three most recent volumes of the series, devoted to the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims, deal with the different traditions of monotheism. The Jewish tradition is presented as the source of the others. The Jewish myths are not spared, but a deeply sympathetic position is taken to such important thinkers as Maimonides (ben Maimon), Spinoza and Einstein. The book on the Christians is the largest of the series. Jesus is presented as a typical Jew. Most of the original Christian ideas come from Paul, not from Jesus. After Constantine became a sort of Christian, theological discussions about such issues as the Holy Trinity were settled by force. The intellectual contributions of the main Christian thinkers (like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and Luther) are analyzed and evaluated, but also the great historical processes are covered, like the Crusades, the universities, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. Less attention is devoted to the last two centuries, as Mosterin thinks that in this period Christianity has decoupled itself from all new developments in science and philosophy, and Christian ideas have become increasingly irrelevant. The book devoted to Islam offers a critical description of the formation of the Quran and of the history of Muslim law, theology, Sufism, philosophy, mathematics and empirical science. Special attention is paid to the main thinkers of the period of splendor of Islamic civilization (8th to 12th centuries), like Avicenna, Averroes, Omar Khayyam and Al-Khwarizmi. The coverage of the contemporary period is more superficial, but up-to-date, as Mosterín deals with the 2011 Arab revolutions and gives his own assessment of the actual Islamic dilemmas.\n\n"}

Epiphanius (\"Haer\". 51.427) made Leucius a disciple of John who joined his master in opposing the Ebionites, a characterization that appears unlikely, since other patristic writers agree that the cycle attributed to him was Docetist, denying the humanity of Christ. Augustine knew the cycle, which he attributed to \"Leutius\", which his adversary Faustus of Mileve thought had been wrongly excluded from the New Testament canon by the Catholics.

{"id": "205466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205466", "title": "Lexical semantics", "text": "Lexical semantics\n\nLexical semantics (also known as lexicosemantics), is a subfield of linguistic semantics. The units of analysis in lexical semantics are lexical units which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as affixes and even compound words and phrases. Lexical units make up the catalogue of words in a language, the lexicon. Lexical semantics looks at how the meaning of the lexical units correlates with the structure of the language or syntax. This is referred to as syntax-semantic interface.\n\nThe study of lexical semantics looks at:\n\nLexical units, also referred to as syntactic atoms, can stand alone such as in the case of root words or parts of compound words or they necessarily attach to other units such as prefixes and suffixes do. The former are called free morphemes and the latter bound morphemes. They fall into a narrow range of meanings (semantic fields) and can combine with each other to generate new meanings.\n\nLexical items contain information about category (lexical and syntactic), form and meaning. The semantics related to these categories then relate to each lexical item in the lexicon. Lexical items can also be semantically classified based on whether their meanings are derived from single lexical units or from their surrounding environment.\n\nLexical items participate in regular patterns of association with each other. Some relations between lexical items include hyponymy, hypernymy, synonymy, and antonymy, as well as homonymy.\n\nHyponymy and hypernymy refers to a relationship between a general term and the more specific terms that fall under the category of the general term.\n\nFor example, the colors \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\" and \"yellow\" are hyponyms. They fall under the general term of \"color\", which is the hypernym.\n\nHyponyms and hypernyms can be described by using a taxonomy, as seen in the example.\n\nSynonymy refers to words that are pronounced and spelled differently but contain the same meaning.\nAntonymy refers to words that are related by having the opposite meanings to each other.\nThere are three types of antonyms: graded antonyms, complementary antonyms, and relational antonyms.\nHomonymy refers to the relationship between words that are spelled or pronounced the same way but hold different meanings.\n\nLexical semantics also explores whether the meaning of a lexical unit is established by looking at its neighbourhood in the semantic net, (words it occurs with in natural sentences), or whether the meaning is already locally contained in the lexical unit.\n\nIn English, WordNet is an example of a semantic network. It contains English words that are grouped into synsets. Some semantic relations between these synsets are meronymy, hyponymy, synonymy, and antonymy.\n\nFirst proposed by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes that a group of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words \"boil\", \"bake\", \"fry\", and \"roast\", for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of \"cooking\". Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy \"(big\" and \"large),\" antonymy \"(big\" and \"small),\" hypernymy and hyponymy \"(rose\" and \"flower),\" converseness \"(buy\" and \"sell),\" and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.\n\nKnowing the meaning of a lexical item therefore means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words \"rose\" and \"rabbit\" without knowing what a \"marigold\" or a \"muskrat\" is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word \"red\" without knowing the meaning of \"scarlet,\" but understanding \"scarlet\" without knowing the meaning of \"red\" may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like \"German shepherd,\" would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. \"corgi\", or \"poodle\"), thus expanding the semantic field further.\n\nEvent structure is defined as the semantic relation of a verb and its syntactic properties.\nEvent structure has three primary components:\nVerbs can belong to one of three types: states, processes, or transitions.\n\n(1a) defines the state of the door being closed; there is no opposition in this predicate. (1b) and (1c) both have predicates showing transitions of the door going from being implicitly \"open\" to \"closed\". (1b) gives the intransitive use of the verb close, with no explicit mention of the causer, but (1c) makes explicit mention of the agent involved in the action.\n\nThe analysis of these different lexical units had a decisive role in the field of \"generative linguistics\" during the 1960s. The term \"generative\" was proposed by Noam Chomsky in his book Syntactic Structures published in 1957. The term \"generative linguistics\" was based on Chomsky's generative grammar, a linguistic theory that states systematic sets of rules (X' theory) can predict grammatical phrases within a natural language. Generative Linguistics is also known as Government-Binding Theory.\nGenerative linguists of the 1960s, including Noam Chomsky and Ernst von Glasersfeld, believed semantic relations between transitive verbs and intransitive verbs were tied to their independent syntactic organization. This meant that they saw a simple verb phrase as encompassing a more complex syntactic structure.\n\nLexicalist theories became popular during the 1980s, and emphasized that a word's internal structure was a question of morphology and not of syntax. Lexicalist theories emphasized that complex words (resulting from compounding and derivation of affixes) have lexical entries that are derived from morphology, rather than resulting from overlapping syntactic and phonological properties, as Generative Linguistics predicts. The distinction between Generative Linguistics and Lexicalist theories can be illustrated by considering the transformation of the word \"destroy\" to \"destruction\":\n\n\nA lexical entry lists the basic properties of either the whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes that make up the word itself. The properties of lexical items include their category selection \"c-selection\", selectional properties \"s-selection\", (also known as semantic selection), phonological properties, and features. The properties of lexical items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the lexical items that they describe.\n\nThe following is an example of a lexical entry for the verb \"put\":\nLexicalist theories state that a word's meaning is derived from its morphology or a speaker's lexicon, and not its syntax. The degree of morphology's influence on overall grammar remains controversial. Currently, the linguists that perceive one engine driving both morphological items and syntactic items are in the majority.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Chomsky's minimalist framework on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages. These probing techniques analyzed negative data over prescriptive grammars, and because of Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved to in order to fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as ditransitive, inchoative, and causative verbs), could select their own specifier element within a syntax tree construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).\n\nThis brought the focus back on the syntax-lexical semantics interface; however, syntacticians still sought to understand the relationship between complex verbs and their related syntactic structure, and to what degree the syntax was projected from the lexicon, as the Lexicalist theories argued.\n\nIn the mid 90's, linguists Heidi Harley, Samuel Jay Keyser, and Kenneth Hale addressed some of the implications posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template. \"Predicates\" are verbs and state or affirm something about the subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates \"went\" and \"is here\" below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.\n\nThe subunits of Verb Phrases led to the Argument Structure Hypothesis and Verb Phrase Hypothesis, both outlined below. The recursion found under the \"umbrella\" Verb Phrase, the VP Shell, accommodated binary-branching theory; another critical topic during the 1990s. Current theory recognizes the predicate in Specifier position of a tree in inchoative/anticausative verbs (intransitive), or causative verbs (transitive) is what selects the theta role conjoined with a particular verb.\n\nKenneth Hale and Samuel Jay Keyser introduced their thesis on lexical argument structure during the early 1990s.\nThey argue that a predicate's argument structure is represented in the syntax, and that the syntactic representation of the predicate is a lexical projection of its arguments. Thus, the structure of a predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle. This lexical projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis. This idea coincides with Chomsky's Projection Principle, because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).\n\nBased on the interaction between lexical properties, locality, and the properties of the EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.\n\nMorris Halle and Alec Marantz introduced the notion of distributed morphology in 1993. This theory views the syntactic structure of words as a result of morphology and semantics, instead of the morpho-semantic interface being predicted by the syntax. Essentially, the idea that under the Extended Projection Principle there is a local boundary under which a special meaning occurs. This meaning can only occur if a head-projecting morpheme is present within the local domain of the syntactic structure. The following is an example of the tree structure proposed by distributed morphology for the sentence \"John's destroying the city\". \"Destroy\" is the root, V-1 represents verbalization, and D represents nominalization.\n\nIn her 2008 book, \"Verb Meaning and The Lexicon: A First-Phase Syntax\", linguist Gillian Ramchand acknowledges the roles of lexical entries in the selection of complex verbs and their arguments. 'First-Phase' syntax proposes that event structure and event participants are directly represented in the syntax by means of binary branching. This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.\n\nRamchand also introduced the concept of Homomorphic Unity, which refers to the structural synchronization between the head of a complex verb phrase and its complement. According to Ramchand, Homomorphic Unity is \"when two event descriptors are syntactically Merged, the structure of the complement must unify with the structure of the head.\"\n\nThe unaccusative hypothesis was put forward by David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures. These are unaccusative verbs and unergative verbs. These classes of verbs are defined by Perlmutter only in syntactic terms. They have the following structures underlyingly:\n\n\nThe following is an example from English:\n\nIn (2a) the verb underlyingly takes a direct object, while in (2b) the verb underlyingly takes a subject.\n\nThe change-of-state property of Verb Phrases (VP) is a significant observation for the syntax of lexical semantics because it provides evidence that subunits are embedded in the VP structure, and that the meaning of the entire VP is influenced by this internal grammatical structure. (For example, the VP \"the vase broke\" carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: inchoative and causative.\n\nInchoative verbs are intransitive, meaning that they occur without a direct object, and these verbs express that their subject has undergone a certain change of state. Inchoative verbs are also known as anticausative verbs. Causative verbs are transitive, meaning that they occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.\n\nLinguist Martin Haspelmath classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs under three main categories: causative, anticausative, and non-directed alternations. Non-directed alternations are further subdivided into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.\n\nEnglish tends to favour labile alternations, meaning that the same verb is used in the inchoative and causative forms. This can be seen in the following example: \"broke\" is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).\n\nAs seen in the underlying tree structure for (3a), the silent subunit BECOME is embedded within the Verb Phrase (VP), resulting in the inchoative change-of-state meaning (y become z). In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).\n\nEnglish change of state verbs are often de-adjectival, meaning that they are derived from adjectives. We can see this in the following example:\n\nIn example (4a) we start with a stative intransitive adjective, and derive (4b) where we see an intransitive inchoative verb. In (4c) we see a transitive causative verb.\n\nSome languages (e.g., German, Italian, and French), have multiple morphological classes of inchoative verbs. Generally speaking, these languages separate their inchoative verbs into three classes: verbs that are obligatorily unmarked (they are not marked with a reflexive pronoun, clitic, or affix), verbs that are optionally marked, and verbs that are obligatorily marked. The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked. Haspelmath refers to this as the anticausative alternation.\n\nFor example, inchoative verbs in German are classified into three morphological classes. \"Class A\" verbs necessarily form inchoatives with the reflexive pronoun ', \"Class B\" verbs form inchoatives necessarily without the reflexive pronoun, and \"Class C\" verbs form inchoatives optionally with or without the reflexive pronoun. In example (5), the verb ' is an unmarked inchoative verb from \"Class B\", which also remains unmarked in its causative form.\n\nIn contrast, the verb \"öffnete\" is a \"Class A\" verb which necessarily takes the reflexive pronoun \"sich\" in its inchoative form, but remains unmarked in its causative form.\nThere has been some debate as to whether the different classes of inchoative verbs are purely based in morphology, or whether the differentiation is derived from the lexical-semantic properties of each individual verb. While this debate is still unresolved in languages such as Italian, French, and Greek, it has been suggested by linguist Florian Schäfer that there are semantic differences between marked and unmarked inchoatives in German. Specifically, that only unmarked inchoative verbs allow an unintentional causer reading (meaning that they can take on an \"x unintentionally caused y\" reading).\n\nCausative morphemes are present in the verbs of many languages (e.g., Tagalog, Malagasy, Turkish, etc.), usually appearing in the form of an affix on the verb. This can be seen in the following examples from Tagalog, where the causative prefix \"pag-\" (realized here as \"nag\") attaches to the verb \"tumba\" to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a). Haspelmath refers to this as the causative alternation.\n\nRichard Kayne proposed the idea of unambiguous paths as an alternative to c-commanding relationships, which is the type of structure seen in examples (8). The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument. When applied to ditransitive verbs, this hypothesis introduces the structure in diagram (8a). In this tree structure it can be seen that the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English. This analysis was a step toward binary branching trees, which was a theoretical change that was furthered by Larson's VP-shell analysis.\n\nLarson posited his Single Complement Hypothesis in which he stated that every complement is introduced with one verb. The Double Object Construction presented in 1988 gave clear evidence of a hierarchical structure using asymmetrical binary branching. Sentences with double objects occur with ditransitive verbs, as we can see in the following example:\nIt appears as if the verb \"send\" has two objects, or complements (arguments): both \"Mary\", the recipient and \"parcel\", the theme. The argument structure of ditransitive verb phrases is complex and has undergone different structural hypothesis.\n\nThe original structural hypothesis was that of ternary branching seen in (9a) and (9b), but following from Kayne's 1981 analysis, Larson maintained that each complement is introduced by a verb.\n\nTheir hypothesis shows that there is a lower verb embedded within a VP shell that combines with an upper verb (can be invisible), thus creating a VP shell (as seen in the tree diagram to the right). Most current theories no longer allow the ternary tree structure of (9a) and (9b), so the theme and the goal/recipient are seen in a hierarchical relationship within a binary branching structure.\n\nFollowing are examples of Larson's tests to show that the hierarchical (superior) order of any two objects aligns with a linear order, so that the second is governed (c-commanded) by the first. This is in keeping with X'Bar Theory of Phrase Structure Grammar, with Larson's tree structure using the empty Verb to which the V is raised.\n\nReflexives and reciprocals (anaphors) show this relationship in which they must be c-commanded by their antecedents, such that the (10a) is grammatical but (10b) is not:\n\nA pronoun must have a quantifier as its antecedent:\n\nQuestion words follow this order:\nThe effect of negative polarity means that \"any\" must have a negative quantifier as an antecedent:\nThese tests with ditransitive verbs that confirm c-command also confirm the presence of underlying or invisible causative verbs. In ditransitive verbs such as \"give someone something\", \"send someone something\", \"show someone something\" etc. there is an underlying causative meaning that is represented in the underlying structure. As seen in example in (9a) above, \"John sent Mary a package\", there is the underlying meaning that 'John \"caused\" Mary to have a package'.\n\nLarson proposed that both sentences in (9a) and (9b) share the same underlying structure and the difference on the surface lies in that the double object construction \"John sent Mary a package\" is derived by transformation from a NP plus PP construction \"John sent a package to Mary\".\n\nBeck and Johnson, however, give evidence that the two underlying structures are not the same. In so doing, they also give further evidence of the presence of two VPs where the verb attaches to a causative verb. In examples (14a) and (b), each of the double object constructions are alternated with NP + PP constructions.\n\nBeck and Johnson show that the object in (15a) has a different relation to the motion verb as it is not able to carry the meaning of HAVING which the possessor (9a) and (15a) can. In (15a), Satoshi is an animate possessor and so is caused to HAVE kisimen. The PP \"for Satoshi\" in (15b) is of a benefactive nature and does not necessarily carry this meaning of HAVE either.\n\nThe underlying structures are therefore not the same. The differences lie in the semantics and the syntax of the sentences, in contrast to the transformational theory of Larson. Further evidence for the structural existence of VP shells with an invisible verbal unit is given in the application of the adjunct or modifier \"again\". Sentence (16) is ambiguous and looking into the two different meanings reveals a difference in structure.\nHowever, in (17a), it is clear that it was Sally who repeated the action of opening the door. In (17b), the event is in the door being opened and Sally may or may not have opened it previously. To render these two different meanings, \"again\" attaches to VPs in two different places, and thus describes two events with a purely structural change.\n"}

Philosophers related to School include Slavoj Žižek, Rastko Močnik, Mladen Dolar, Alenka Zupančič, Miran Božovič and Eva Bahovec. Other scholars associated with the school include philosophers Zdravko Kobe, Rado Riha, Jelica Šumič Riha, sociologist Renata Salecl and philosopher Peter Klepec.\n\nThe school was founded in the late 1970s by young Slovenian followers of the theories of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, in what was then the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Founding members of the school included Slavoj Žižek, Mladen Dolar and Rastko Močnik. Their main aim was to bring together the philosophy of German idealism, Marxism and psychoanalytic theories as a means of analysis of contemporary social, cultural and political phenomena. The school rose to prominence in the international academic environment in the 1990s. The school never engaged in Lacanian psychoanalysis.\n\nThe group was formed around a young generation of Marxist students at the University of Ljubljana, in Socialist Slovenia. Contrary to their older colleagues, affiliated with the Praxis school, these young students rejected Marxist humanism and turned towards the \"antihumanism\" of the French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser and, to a lesser extent, to the Frankfurt School.\n\nThe main goal of the Ljubljana School was to re-interpret Marxism by emphasizing the rootedness of Karl Marx's thought in the tradition of German idealism. They favoured an anti-historicist interpretation of Hegel's philosophy, with an emphasis on his epistemology and dialectic philosophy. Most of the members of the Ljubljana school have been indebted to the Slovenian Marxist Božidar Debenjak, professor of philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, renowned for his attentive reading of German idealism, who introduced the Frankfurt School in Slovenia.\n\nA specific feature of the Ljubljana School was to connect the Marxist and Hegelian traditions with Lacanian psychoanalysis and with Structuralism. The combined reading of Lacan, German idealism (especially Hegel), Marx, the Frankfurt school and authors from the structuralist tradition, especially Claude Lévi-Strauss, has since been the distinctive feature of the Ljubljana School.\n\nThe Ljubljana School of Psychoanalysis focuses on the following areas:\n\nThe school first emerged in the late 1970s as a distinct intellectual group within the alternative journal \"Problemi\". Since the mid-1960s, this journal served as the only alternative media in Slovenia where critical and dissenting opinions against the mainstream Titoist ideology could be heard. The journal thus hosted an extremely wide range of contributors, from apolitical modernist literates, civic nationalists, conservatives, liberals, social democrats up to radical Marxists, Lacanians and followers of the Frankfurt school. By the early 1980s, the tensions within the editorial board reached their height, causing the more conservative and non-Marxist contributors to publicly petition the authorities of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia to be allowed to establish their own journal. Their demands were accepted in 1981, where a new alternative journal, the \"Nova revija\", was founded. From then on, the followers of the Ljubljana School gradually took over the journal \"Problemi\", transforming it into the main platform of their intellectual activities.\n\nIn 1985, the journal \"Problemi\" launched the \"Analecta\" book series, publishing more than 60 monographs since, mostly translations of classical and contemporary philosophers (e.g. Spinoza, Hume, Hegel, Kant, Derrida, Lyotard and Badiou), as well as Slovene authors.In the late 1980s, the Society for Theoretical Psychoanalysis was founded as the central coordinating body of publishing and editorial activities of the group. The current president of the society is Slavoj Žižek.\n\nNevertheless, the academic activity has mostly been taking place within the University of Ljubljana and the various institutes and departments associated to it (such as the Faculty of Arts and the Institute for Sociology) and the Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nThe popular name of \"Ljubljana School of Psychoanalysis\" is seen as problematic by some, since none of its members is a practicing psychoanalyst. The issue was raised by The Slovenian Society For Lacanian Psychoanalysis in 2015.\n\nThe Slovene Society for Theoretical Analysis, around which the popular name is centered, responded that its work is »focused on intersections and encounters between philosophy and psychoanalysis. It has never pretended to deal with anything else but the theoretical psychoanalysis, and this entails no conflict with psychoanalytic practice nor has anyone ever maintained that the one would be a replacement for the other.«\n\nIn 2008 and 2010, the Slovene Society for Theoretical Analysis published two Lacan's Seminars into Slovene without authorisation, while violating a copyright policy.\n\nIn 2016 the Slovenian Lacanian psychoanalyst Nina Krajnik launched an international initiative with the claim that Ljubljana School tried to prevent the presence of the Lacanian psychoanalysis in Slovenia and that several academic articles of the members of Ljubljana School are based on plagiarism. In 2017 the World Association for Psychoanalysis gave a support to Krajnik's claim.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21173", "title": "Natural language", "text": "Natural language\n\nIn neuropsychology, linguistics, and the philosophy of language, a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing. They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or to study logic.\n\nThough the exact definition varies between scholars, natural language can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or constructed languages (such as computer programming languages and international auxiliary languages) and to other communication systems in nature. Such examples include bees' waggle dance and whale song, to which researchers have found or applied the linguistic cognates of dialect and even syntax. \n\nAll language varieties of world languages are natural languages, although some varieties are subject to greater degrees of published prescriptivism or language regulation than others. Thus nonstandard dialects can be viewed as a wild type in comparison with standard languages. But even an official language with a regulating academy, such as Standard French with the French Academy, is classified as a natural language (for example, in the field of natural language processing), as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a constructed language or controlled enough to be classified as a controlled natural language.\n\nControlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity (for instance, by cutting down on rarely used superlative or adverbial forms or irregular verbs). The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled natural language typically is to aid non-native speakers of a natural language in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a natural language. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is Simplified English, which was originally developed for aerospace industry maintenance manuals.\n\nConstructed international auxiliary languages such as Esperanto and Interlingua (even those that have native speakers) are not generally considered natural languages. Natural languages have been used to communicate and have evolved in a natural way, whereas Esperanto was designed by L.L. Zamenhof selecting elements from natural languages, not grown from natural fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax. Some natural languages have become naturally \"standardized\" by children's natural tendency to correct for illogical grammatical structures in their parents' speech, which can be seen in the development of pidgin languages into creole languages (as explained by Steven Pinker in \"The Language Instinct\"), but this is not the case in many languages, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, where strict rules are in place as an attempt to consciously remove such irregularities. The possible exception to this are true native speakers of such languages. More substantive basis for this designation is that the vocabulary, grammar, and orthography of Interlingua are natural; they have been standardized and presented by a linguistic research body, but they predated it and are not themselves considered a product of human invention. Most experts, however, consider Interlingua to be naturalistic rather than natural. Latino Sine Flexione, a second naturalistic auxiliary language, is also naturalistic in content but is no longer widely spoken.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4344340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4344340", "title": "Neidan", "text": "Neidan\n\nNeidan, or internal alchemy (), is an array of esoteric doctrines and physical, mental, and spiritual practices that Taoist initiates use to prolong life and create an immortal spiritual body that would survive after death (Skar and Pregadio 2000, 464). Also known as Jindan (金丹 \"golden elixir\"), inner alchemy combines theories derived from external alchemy (\"waidan\" 外丹), correlative cosmology (including the Five Phases), the emblems of the \"Yijing\", and medical theory, with techniques of Daoist meditation, daoyin gymnastics, and sexual hygiene (Baldrian-Hussein 2008, 762).\n\nIn Neidan the human body becomes a cauldron (or \"ding\") in which the Three Treasures of Jing (\"Essence\"), Qi (\"Breath\") and Shen (\"Spirit\") are cultivated for the purpose of improving physical, emotional and mental health, and ultimately returning to the primordial unity of the Tao, i.e., becoming an Immortal. It is believed the \"Xiuzhen Tu\" is such a cultivation map. In China, it is an important form of practice for most schools of Taoism.\n\nThe Chinese compound \"nèidān\" combines the common word \"nèi\" 內 meaning \"inside; inner; internal\" with \"dān\" 丹 \"cinnabar; vermillion; elixir; alchemy\". The antonym of \"nèi\" is \"wài\" 外 \"outside; exterior; external\", and \"nèidān\" \"internal elixir / alchemy\" was coined from the earlier complementary term \"wàidān\" 外丹 \"external elixir / alchemy\".\n\nChinese alchemical texts and sources ordinarily call \"neidan\" the \"jīndān dào\" 金丹道 or Way of the Golden Elixir. In Modern Standard Chinese usage, the term \"nèidān shù\" 內丹術 (with 術 \"art; skill; technique; method\") refers generally to internal alchemical practices.\n\nThe date for the earliest use of the term \"neidan\" is uncertain. Arthur Waley proposed that it was first recorded in the 559 vow taken by Tiantai Buddhist patriarch Nanyue Huisi praying to successfully make an elixir that would keep him alive till the coming of Maitreya (1930: 14). Many scholars agreed, including Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen who translated Huisi's vow to live as an ascetic in the mountains:\nI am seeking for the longevity in order to defend the Faith, not in order to enjoy worldly happiness. I pray that all the saints and sages will come to my help, so that I may get some good magic mushrooms [\"zhi\" 芝], and numinous elixirs [\"shendan\" 神丹], enabling me to cure all illnesses and to stop both hunger and thirst. In this way I shall be able to practice continually the way of the Sutras and to engage in the several forms of meditations. I shall hope to find a peaceful dwelling in the depths of the mountains, with enough numinous elixirs and medicine to carry out my plans. Thus by the aids of external elixirs [\"waidan\"] I shall be able to cultivate the elixir within [\"neidan\"]. (1983: 140) \nOthers believed that \"neidan\" first occurred in the biographies of Deng Yuzhi 鄧郁之 (fl. 483–493) and Su Yuanming 蘇元明 (fl. c. 600). However, the authenticity of the relevant passages in these \"pseudo-historical sources\" is doubtful (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 164–171).\n\nThe term \"neidan\" was seldom used throughout the late Tang dynasty (618–907) and Five dynasties (907–960) period, and only became widespread around the beginning of the Song dynasty (960–1279) period, when \"neidan\" evolved into a highly complex system in both its theoretical and practical aspects (Baldrian-Hussein 2008: 763). Tang texts described internal alchemical practices with the words \"fúyào\" 服藥 \"take drug/medicine\" and \"chángshēng\" 長生 \"long life, longevity; (Daoism) eternal life\" (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 170). Liu Xiyue's 劉希岳 988 \"Taixuan langranzi jindao shi\" 太玄朗然子進道詩 (Master Taixuan Langran's Poems on Advancing in the Dao) has the earliest datable mention of the terms \"neidan\" and \"waidan\" (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 174, 178, 180). The c. 1019 \"Yunji Qiqian\" Daoist anthology mentions the term \"neidan\" (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 178).\n\nEarly texts that mention \"neidan\" define it as synonymous or similar with some \"qi\" circulation techniques: Cultivation and Transmutation (\"xiulian\" 修煉), Embryonic Breathing (\"taixi\" 胎息), the Cyclical Elixir (\"huandan\" 還丹), the Golden Elixir (\"jindan\" 金丹), the Great Elixir (\"dadan\" 大丹), the Interior and Exterior Medicines (\"nei/waiyao\" 内外藥), the Inner and Outer Counterparts (\"nei/waixiang\" 内外象), and the Yin Elixir and Yang Elixir (\"yindan\" 陰丹 and \"yangdan\" 陽丹) (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 179–186). \n\nBased upon the textual evidence, Farzeen Baldrian-Hussein concludes that in early texts, \"neidan\" refers to a specific technique, and by Song Emperor Zhenzong's reign (997–1022), the term designates a group of techniques, expressed in specific alchemical language (1989: 187).\n\nNeidan is part of the Chinese alchemical meditative tradition that is said to have been separated into internal and external (\"Waidan\") at some point during the Tang dynasty. The \"Cantong qi\" (The Kinship of the Three) is the earliest known book on theoretical alchemy in China; it was written by the alchemist Wei Boyang in 142 AD. This text influenced the formation of Neidan, whose earliest existing texts date from the first half of the 8th century. The authors of several Neidan articles refer to their teachings as the Way of the Golden Elixir (\"jindan zhi dao\"). The majority of Chinese alchemical sources is found in the \"Daozang\" (Taoist Canon), the largest collection of Taoist texts.\n\nNeidan shares a significant portion of its notions and methods with classical Chinese medicine, \"fangshi\" and with other bodies of practices, such as meditation and the methods for \"nourishing life\" (\"yangsheng\"). What distinguishes alchemy from these related traditions is its unique view of the elixir as a material or immaterial entity that represents the original state of being and the attainment of that state. The Neidan tradition of internal alchemy is practiced by working with the energies that were already present in the human body as opposed to using natural substances, medicines or elixirs, from outside of the body. The Shangqing School of Daoism played an important role in the emergence of Neidan alchemy, after using Waidan mainly as a meditative practice, and therefore turning it from an external to an internal art.\n\nInternal alchemy focuses upon transforming the bodily \"sanbao\" \"three treasures\", which are the essential energies sustaining human life: \nAccording to the 13th-century \"Book of Balance and Harmony\":\nWhen the \"three treasures\" are internally maintained, along with a balance of yin and yang, it is possible to achieve a healthy body and longevity, which are the main goals of internal alchemy (Ching 1996, 395).\n\n\"Jing\" \"essence\" referring to the energies of the physical body. Based upon the idea that death was caused by depleting one's \"jing\", Daoist internal alchemy claimed that preserving \"jing\" allowed one to achieve longevity, if not immortality. (Schipper 1993, 154).\n\n\"Qi\" or \"ch'i\" is defined as the \"natural energy of the universe\" and manifests in everyone and everything (Carroll 2008). By means of internal alchemy, Taoists strive to obtain a positive flow of \"qi\" through the body in paths moving to each individual organ (Smith 1986, 201).\n\nHealing practices such as acupuncture, massage, cupping and herbal medicines are believed to open up the \"qi\" meridians throughout the body so that the \"qi\" can flow freely. Keeping \"qi\" in balance and flowing throughout the body promotes health; imbalance can lead to sickness.\n\n\"Shen\" is the original spirit of the body. Taoists try to become conscious of \"shen\" through meditation (Smith 1986, 202).\n\n\n"}

Nomothetic approaches are most appropriate to the deductive approach to social research inasmuch as they include the more highly structured research methodologies which can be replicated and controlled, and which focus on generating quantitative data with a view to explaining causal relationships.\n\nIn anthropology, nomothetic refers to the use of generalization rather than specific properties in the context of a group as an entity.\n\nIn law, nomothetic propositions are law \"stricto sensu\". That is, a nomo thesis (legal position) is an invariable \"fact of life\" and is invariable and cannot be other than it is. Legal science is generally not considered nomothetical in late modernity though some scholars in antiquity and in the Middle Ages seemed to believe that law, or at least some laws, were nomothetic (see natural law). The field of \"nomothetics\" can also refer to the science of the creation of legal systems, as in jurisprudence and the ordered arrangement of law systemization in new and constructed ways.\n"}

She's also served as the Deputy Director of the Center for Social Media for American University's School of Communications, and has occupied a number of other posts.\n\nBesides her academic appointments, McAfee has also founded and directed the Council for Public Media in Austin, Texas from 1991-1995, on the board of the National Writers United Service Organization from 1995 to 1997, as a board member of Public Deliberation '96, as an advisor for various research projects and in various other politically-minded roles since. She began to serve as a consultant to the Kettering Foundation in 1988, and continues to do so.\n\nMcAfee's research primarily focuses on questions of democracy and democratic practice, the same questions that had her enter academic philosophy in the first place. Her most recent research draws on prior work in psychoanalytic theory, democratic media, performative ethics, transitional justice, and feminist political theory to examine the role of informal political institutions in the formation of a democratic public. McAfee has done significant work on the writings of Julia Kristeva and Jürgen Habermas, and also delved extensively into feminist theory and the works of Hannah Arendt.\n\nMcAfee has authored three books; the first, \"Habermas, Kristeva, and Citizenship\" was published by Cornell University Press in 2000; the second \"Julia Kristeva\" was published in 2003 by Routledge, and the third \"Democracy and the Political Unconscious\" was published in 2008 by Columbia University Press. A fourth book, tentatively titled \"Democracy Otherwise\" is in progress. McAfee has also served as editor for a number of books and journal issues, and has also published a large number of peer-reviewed papers and several encyclopedia articles.\n\n\"Habermas, Kristeva, and Citizenship\" attempts to join the discourses of modernity and postmodernity in political theory and bring them to bear on the problem of deliberative democracy. McAfee's view is strongly informed by feminist theory, and she believes that political life is rooted in participation in political and that political agency is not a trait of rational individuals, but rather something enacted collectively through interactions with others in civil society.\n\nMcAfee's \"Democracy and the Political Unconscious\" examines some of the pathologies that have been created in the United States in the wake of the Collapse of the World Trade Center. She believes that the way that the event was handled has resulted in the United States continually reliving the trauma of that day, and believes that the War on Terror is one significant cause of this cycle of unending trauma. She points towards South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a model of how the United States could move past that trauma.\n"}

H. Tawney to Puritan concerns for system and method in 17th-century England. The same period saw English prose developing the qualities Matthew Arnold described as \"regularity, uniformity, precision, balance\".\n\n\"Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time\" is a saying attributed to Benjamin Franklin in 1730, while he was 20 years old. It was part of his 13 virtues.\n\nA darker view of the early modern internalisation of order and discipline was taken by Michel Foucault in \"The Order of Things\" and \"Discipline and Punish\"; but for Rousseau love of order both in nature and in the harmonious psyche of the natural man was one of the tap-roots of moral conscience.\n\nThe Romantic reaction against reason, industry and the sober virtues, led to a downgrading of order as well. In art, spontaneity took precedence over method and craft; in life, the Bohemian call of wildness and disorder eclipsed the appeal of ordered sobriety – as with the cultivated disorganization of the sixties hippie.\n\n\"Latter-day attempts such as those of Deidre McCloskey to reclaim the bourgeois virtues like order may be met in some quarters only by laughter.\"\n\nSociologists, while noting that praise of order is generally associated with a conservative stance – one that can be traced back through Edmund Burke and Richard Hooker to Aristotle - point out that many taken-for-granted aspects of social order (such as which side of the road to drive on) produce substantial and equitable advantages for individuals at very little personal cost. Conversely, breakdowns in public order reveal everyone's daily dependence upon the smooth functioning of the wider society.\n\nDurkheim saw anomie as the existential reaction to the ordered disorder of modern society.\n\nJungians considered orderliness (along with restraint and responsibility) as one of the virtues attributable to the senex or old man - as opposed to the spontaneous openness of the puer or eternal youth.\n\nFreud saw the positive traits of orderliness and conscientiousness as rooted in anal eroticism.\n\nFreud himself was a highly organised personality, ordering his life – at work and play – with the regularity of a timetable.\n\nWilliam Osler was another highly successful physician who built his life on a highly organised basis.\n\nWallace Stevens wrote of the \"blessed rage for order\" in \"Ideas of Order\" (1936).\n\n\nWilliam Osler, \"Aequanimitas\" (New York 1963)\n"}
{"id": "20554218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20554218", "title": "Perates", "text": "Perates\n\nThe Perates or Peratae (, \"to pass through\"; , \"to penetrate\") were a Gnostic sect from the 2nd century AD. The \"Philosophumena\" of Hippolytus is our only real source of information on their origin and beliefs. The founders of the school were a certain Euphrates (whom Origen calls the founder of those Ophites to whom Celsus referred about 175 AD) and Celbes, elsewhere called Acembes and Ademes.\n\nIt had been known from Clement of Alexandria that there was a sect of that name, though he tells nothing as to its tenets. Hippolytus was acquainted with more books of the sect than one. One called \"Oi Proasteioi\" appears to have been of an astrological character, treating of the influence of the stars upon the human race, and connecting various mythologies with the planetary powers. There was besides a treatise which resembles the doctrine of the Naassenes.\n\nAccording to the Peratics, the cosmos is one, but also consists of a threefold division; this rendering of the cosmos they symbolized by a circle circumscribing a triangle. The circle denoted the unity and oneness of the cosmos, while the triangle represented the \"Three Worlds\" of \"Patēr, Huios, Hulē\" [Greek: πατηρ, ὕιος, ὕλη]. These \"three Minds\" or \"three Gods,\" as they were called, each possessed certain characteristics:\n\nIn this conception of the cosmos, the Son sits as an intermediary between the immovable source of all existence (the Father) and the formless chaos of Matter. The Son, as the Word [λογος] and represented by an ever-turning Serpent, first faces the Father, collecting the outflow of divine powers (or Ideas, Forms), then turns to face Hulē, pouring the powers upon the Matter. It is in this way that formless Hulē is transformed into material reality, the sensible cosmos that mirrors the divine, noetic one from which it receives its existence. This process is akin to several other cosmogonic conceptions of the ancient world (especially those found in Stoicism (see also Stoic Physics), Platonism (see also Plato's Theory of Forms), Neoplatonism, Hermetism, and Aristotelian hylomorphism).\n\nThe Peratic conception of the cosmos was used to explain certain biblical verse. For example, when, Jesus says, \"Your Father which is in heaven,\" they understood him to mean Patēr, the heavenly father, the first principle, from which the forms have been derived. But when he says \"your father was a murderer from the beginning,\" he means the ruler and framer of Hulē, who, taking the forms transmitted by the Son, works generation in the material cosmos, a work which is destruction and death (because of the transitory nature of the world of becoming).\n\nFor the redemption of this world below, Christ was made to descend in the days of Herod, from the region of the unbegotten, a man himself threefold, having in himself powers from the three parts of the world, \"for in Him the whole Pleroma was pleased to dwell bodily,\" and in Him was the whole Godhead. His mission is in order that those elements which descended from above may by him be enabled to return, while those elements which plotted against the higher ones shall be separated and left for punishment.\nWhen, then, the Saviour comes into the world, just as the amber attracts the chaff, and the magnet the iron, and the spine of the sea hawk the gold, so this serpent attracts to himself those whose nature is such as to be capable of receiving his influence. Such persons are called Peratae because, by means of their \"gnosis\" they have learned how safely to pass through (\"perasai\") the corruption to which everything that is generated is subject.\n\nAll the ignorant are Egyptians. Egypt is the body, coming out of Egypt is coming out of the body, and passing the Red Sea, that is the water of destruction; or, in other words, generation. Those, however, who suppose themselves to have passed the Red Sea, are still liable to be assailed by the gods of destruction, whom Moses called the serpents of the desert, who bite and destroy those who had hoped to escape the power of the gods of generation. For these Moses exhibited the true and perfect serpent, on whom they who believed were not bitten by the gods of destruction. None but this true serpent, the perfect of the perfect, can save and deliver those who go out of Egypt, that is to say from the body and from the world.\n\nWe are given additional insight by Hippolytus into what G.R.S. Mead calls an \"analogical psycho-physiological process in man\":\n\nFor a proof of this, they adduce the anatomy of the brain, assimilating, from the fact of its immobility, the brain itself to the Father, and the cerebellum to the Son, because of its being moved and being of the form of (the head of) a serpent. And they allege that this (cerebellum), by an ineffable and inscrutable process, attracts through the pineal gland the spiritual and life-giving substance emanating from the vaulted chamber (in which the brain is embedded). And on receiving this, the cerebellum in an ineffable manner imparts the ideas, just as the Son does, to matter; or, in other words, the seeds and the genera of the things produced according to the flesh flow along into the spinal marrow. Employing this exemplar, (the heretics) seem to adroitly introduce their secret mysteries, which are delivered in silence.\n\nHippolytus, followed by Theodoret, speaks of the Peratae as founded by Euphrates the \"Peratic,\" and Acembes the Carystian. There is certainly a case for suspicion that this Euphrates the Peratic, the supposed founder of the sect of Peratics, may be as mythical a personage as Ebion, the eponymous founder of the Ebionites. We do not read elsewhere of any Euphrates but the Stoic philosopher, who lived in the reign of Hadrian, whom we cannot supposed to have been a teacher of Ophite doctrine. But the name of the river Euphrates was largely used among the Peratae with a mystical signification; and it is conceivable that members of the sect, knowing the name to be held in honour among them, and knowing also that there had been an eminent teacher so called, may have been led to claim him as their founder. On the other hand, it is plain that the Peratic treatise of which Hippolytus gives an abstract, and which may have been also seen by Origen, contained the name of Euphrates coupled with that of Acembes the Carystian, a personage whom there was no motive for inventing. There is nothing incredible in the supposition that these are the names of real Ophite teachers, too obscure to leave any record of their existence, outside their own sect.\n\nThe title \"Peratic,\" as applied to the sect, is explained by Clement of Alexandria as one derived from place. In this sense it may have taken its origin from the phrase Ἅβραμ ὁ περατής (, LXX), which was understood to mean one who came from the other side of the Euphrates. Pliny, speaking of a certain gum which came from Arabia, India, Media, and Babylon, adds that that which came from Media was called by some Peratic. This seems to be the same as the Peratic frankincense spoken of by Arrian. It is probably a mere corruption that Sophronius of Jerusalem speaks of Euphrates \"Persicus,\" for he clearly got the name from Theodoret; yet the corruption may have originated in the change of an unfamiliar word into a supposed equivalent. On the whole, we may conclude that this Euphrates, if he existed, came from the extreme east.\n\nBunsen has suggested that this designation can mean Euboean. He founds this conjecture on the facts that Acembes, with whom Euphrates is coupled, came from Euboea, and that Euboea is sometimes spoken of as ἡ πέραν, the other side. But this does not prove that the name \"Peratic\" would ever have been understood as equivalent to \"Euboean;\" it is nowhere stated that Euphrates and Acembes were fellow countrymen, and if they were, it is not likely that the one would have been designated after his town and the other generally after the island.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "685895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=685895", "title": "René Guénon", "text": "René Guénon\n\nRené-Jean-Marie-Joseph Guénon (; 15 November 1886 – 7 January 1951), also known as ʿAbd al-Wāḥid Yaḥyá (), was a French author and intellectual who remains an influential figure in the domain of metaphysics, having written on topics ranging from sacred science and traditional studies, to symbolism and initiation.\n\nHe wrote and published in French, and his works have been translated into more than twenty languages. He is considered to be an important writer in the Traditionalist School.\n\nRené Guénon was born in Blois, a city in central France approximately from Paris. Guénon, like most Frenchmen of the time, was born into a Roman Catholic family. Little is known of his family, although it appears that his father was an architect. By 1904, Guénon was living as a student in Paris, where his studies focused on mathematics and philosophy. He was known as a brilliant student, notably in mathematics, in spite of his poor health.\n\nAs a young student in Paris, Guénon observed and became involved with some students who were, at that time, under the supervision of Gérard Encausse, alias Papus. Guénon soon discovered that the Esoteric Christian Martinist order, supervised by Papus, was irregular. He joined the Gnostic Church founded by Fabre des Essarts-Synesius. Under the name \"Tau Palingenius\" Guénon became the founder and main contributor of a periodical review, \"La Gnose\" (\"Gnosis\"), writing articles for it until 1922. From his incursions into the French occultist and pseudo-masonic orders, he despaired of the possibility of ever gathering these diverse and often ill-assorted doctrines into a \"stable edifice\". In his book \"The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times\" he also pointed out what he saw as the intellectual vacuity of the French occultist movement, which, he wrote, was utterly insignificant, and more importantly, had been compromised by the infiltration of certain individuals of questionable motives and integrity. Following his desire to join a regular masonic obedience, he became a member of the Thebah Lodge of the \"Grande Loge de France\" following the \"Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite\".\n\nAround this time (according to indications reproduced by his biographer Paul Chacornac), it is possible that René Guénon became acquainted with Hinduism, specifically via the initiatic lineage of Shankarâchârya, and with Taoism, due to his friendship with Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville, alias Matgioi. It is likely that Guénon learned to use opium from de Pouvourville, and Guénon later described the use of opium as an aid to meditation. He met Léon Champrenaud, alias Abdul-Haqq, and John-Gustav Ageli, alias Abdul-Hadi who had been initiated by Abder-Rhaman el Kébir in Cairo. According to Paul Chacornac, Guénon chose a conversion to Islam rather than to Hinduism because the Hindu ritual life is not compatible with the Western way of life, whereas following Islamic rituals is compatible with modern Western life. He believed that Islam is the only traditional religious world that is practically accessible to Westerners. In 1910, Guénon was initiated into the Sufi Shadhili order by Ivan Aguéli, taking the name \"ʿAbd al-Wāḥid Yaḥyā\".\n\nIn 1917, Guénon began a one-year stay at Sétif, Algeria, teaching philosophy to college students. After World War I, he left teaching to dedicate his energies to writing; his first book, \"Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines\", was published in 1921. The book was first proposed as a thesis, but the thesis was rejected by Indologist Sylvain Lévi. From 1925 Guénon became a contributor to a review edited by P. Chacornac, \"Le Voile d'Isis\" (\"The Veil of Isis\"); after 1935 and under Guénon's influence, this periodical became known as \"Les Etudes Traditionnelles\" (\"Traditional Studies\").\n\nAlthough the exposition of Hindu doctrines to European audiences had already been attempted in piecemeal fashion at that time by many orientalists, Guénon's \"Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines\" advanced its subject in a uniquely insightful manner, by referring to the concepts of metaphysics and Tradition in their most general sense, which Guénon precisely defined, along with the necessary distinctions and definitions of seemingly unambiguous terms such as religion, tradition, exoterism, esoterism and theology. Guénon explained that his purpose was not to describe all aspects of Hinduism, but to give the necessary intellectual foundation for a proper understanding of its spirit. The book also stands as a harsh condemnation of works presented by certain other European writers about Hinduism and Tradition in general; according to Guénon, such writers had lacked any profound understanding of their subject matter and of its implications. The book also contains a critical analysis of the political intrusions of the British Empire into the subject of Hinduism (and India itself) through Madame Blavatsky's Theosophy.\n\nIn September 1920, Père Peillaube asked Guénon to write a book against the Theosophical Society. In 1921, Guénon debuted a series of articles in the French \"Revue de Philosophie\", which, along with some supplements, led to the book \"Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion\". His critique of Theosophy was received positively by conservative Catholics. However his later book \"Orient et Occident\" distanced him from his Catholic supporters. His friend and erstwhile supporter Jacques Maritain argued that Guénon's views were \"radically irreconcilable with the [Catholic] faith and called them a \"Hinduist restoration of ancient Gnosis, mother of heresies\". Maritain later unsuccessfully tried to have Guénon's works put on the Catholic Index of Prohibited Books. During the decade 1920–1930, Guénon began to acquire a broader public reputation, and his work was noted by various intellectual and artistic figures both within and outside of Paris. Also at this time were published some of his books explaining the \"intellectual divide\" between the East and West, and the peculiar nature, according to him, of modern civilization: \"Crisis of the Modern World\", and \"East and West\". In 1927 was published the second major doctrinal book of his works: \"Man and His Becoming according to the Vedânta\", and in 1929, \"Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power\". The last book listed offers a general explanation of what Guénon saw as the fundamental differences between \"sacerdotal\" (priestly or sacred) and \"royal\" (governmental) powers, along with the negative consequences arising from the usurpation of the prerogatives of the latter with regard to the former. From these considerations, René Guénon traces to its source the origin of the modern deviation, which, according to him, is to be found in the destruction of the Templar order in 1314.\n\nIn 1930, Guénon left Paris for Cairo. During his lengthy sojourn in Egypt, René Guénon carried on an austere and simple life, entirely dedicated to his writings and spiritual development. In 1949, he obtained Egyptian citizenship. Sedgwick wrote about Guénon's life in Egypt that even though he continued his interest in Hinduism and other religions, Guénon's own practice was purely Islamic. He is \"not known ever to have recommended anyone to become a Hindu, whereas he introduced many to Islam\".\n\nUrged on by some of his friends and collaborators, Guénon agreed to establish a new Masonic Lodge in France founded upon his \"Traditional\" ideals, purified of what he saw as the inauthentic accretions which so bedeviled other lodges he had encountered during his early years in Paris. This lodge was called \"La Grande Triade\" (\"The Great Triad\"), a name inspired by the title of one of Guénon's books. The first founders of the lodge, however, separated a few years after its inception. Nevertheless, this lodge, belonging to the Grande Loge de France, remains active today.\n\nRené Guénon died on Sunday, January 7, 1951; his final word was \"Allah\".\n\nIn 1921, Guénon published an \"Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines\". His goal, as he writes it, is an attempt at presenting to westerners eastern metaphysics and spirituality as they are understood and thought by easterners themselves, while pointing at what René Guénon describes as all the erroneous interpretations and misunderstandings of western orientalism and \"neospiritualism\" (for the latter, notably the proponents of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophy). Right from that time, he presents a rigorous understanding, not only of Hindu doctrines, but also of eastern metaphysics in general.\n\nHis work comprises:\n\nGuénon's writings make use of words and terms of fundamental signification, which receive a precise definition throughout his books. These terms and words, although receiving a usual meaning and being used in many branches of human sciences, have, according to René Guénon, lost substantially their original signification (e.g. words such as \"metaphysics\", \"initiation\", \"mysticism\", \"personality\", \"form\", \"matter\"). He insisted notably on the danger represented by the perversion of the signification of words seen by him as essential for the study of metaphysics.\n\nThe exposition of metaphysical doctrines, which forms the cornerstone of Guénon's work, consists of the following books:\n\n\"Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines\", published in 1921, on topics which were later included in the lecture he gave at the Sorbonne on December 17, 1925 (\"Oriental Metaphysics\"), consists of four parts.\n\nThe first part (\"preliminary questions\") exposes the hurdles that prevented classical orientalism from a deep understanding of eastern doctrines (without forgetting that Guénon had of course in view the orientalism of his time): the \"classical prejudice\" which \"consists essentially in a predisposition to attribute the origin of all civilization to the Greeks and Romans\", the ignorance of certain types of relationships between the ancient peoples, linguistic difficulties, and the confusions arising about certain questions related to chronology, these confusions being made possible through the ignorance of the importance of oral transmission which can precede, to a considerable and indeterminate extent, the written formulation. A fundamental example of that latter mistake being found in the orientalist's attempts at providing a precise birth date to the Vedas sacred scriptures.\n\nThe \"general characters of eastern thought\" part focuses on the principles of unity of the eastern civilizations, and on the definition of the notions of \"tradition\" and \"metaphysics\". Guénon also proposes a rigorous definition of the term \"religion\", and states the proper differences between \"tradition\", \"religion\", \"metaphysics\" and \"philosophical system\". The relations between \"metaphysics\" and \"theology\" are also explored, and the fundamental terms of \"esoterism\" and \"exoterism\" are introduced. A chapter is devoted to the idea of \"metaphysical realization\". The first two parts state, according to Guénon, the necessary doctrinal foundations for a correct understanding of Hindu doctrines.\n\nThe \"Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines\" had, among its objectives, the purpose of giving the proper intellectual basis to promote openness to the study of eastern intellectuality. The study of Hindu doctrines is continued in his book \"Man and his Becoming according to the Vedanta\" by taking the specific viewpoint of the human being's constitution according to the Vêdantâ: Guénon states that his goal is not to present a synthetic exposition of all vedic doctrines \"which would be quite an impossible task\", but to consider \"a particular point of that doctrine\", in that case the definition of the human being, in order to contemplate afterwards other aspects of metaphysics.\n\n\"The Symbolism of the Cross\" is a book \"dedicated to the venerated memory of Esh-Sheikh Abder-Rahman Elish El-Kebir\". Its goal, as Guénon states it, \"is to explain a symbol that is common to almost all traditions, a fact that would seem to indicate its direct attachment to the great primordial tradition\". To alleviate the hurdles bound to the interpretations of a symbol belonging to different traditions, Guénon distinguishes \"synthesis\" from \"syncretism\": syncretism consists in assembling from the outside a number of more or less incongruous elements which, when so regarded, can never be truly unified. Syncretism is something outward: the elements taken from any of its quarters and put together in this way can never amount to anything more than borrowings that are effectively incapable of being integrated into a doctrine \"worthy of that name\". To apply these criteria to the present context of the symbolism of the cross:\n\nsyncretism can be recognized wherever one finds elements borrowed from different traditional forms and assembled together without any awareness that there is only one single doctrine of which these forms are so many different expressions or so many adaptations related to particular conditions related to given circumstances of time and place. \n\nThis book expands on the multiple states of Being, a doctrine already tackled in \"The Symbolism of the Cross\", leaving aside the geometrical representation exposed in that book \"to bring out the full range of this altogether fundamental theory\".\nFirst and foremost is asserted the necessity of the \"metaphysical Infinity\", envisaged in its relationship with \"universal Possibility\". \"The Infinite, according to the etymology of the term which designates it, is that which has no limits\", so it can only be applied to what has absolutely no limit, and not to what is exempted from certain limitations while being subjected to others like space, time, quantity, in other words all countless other things that fall within the indefinite, fate and nature. There is no distinction between the Infinite and universal Possibility; simply the correlation between these terms indicates that in the case of the Infinite, it is contemplated in its active aspect, while the universal Possibility refers to its passive aspect: these are the two aspects of Brahma and its \"Shakti\" in the Hindu doctrines. From this results that \"the distinction between the possible and the real [...] has no metaphysical validity, for every possible is real in its way, according to the mode befitting its own nature\". This leads to the metaphysical consideration of the \"Being\" and \"Non-Being\":\n\nIf we [...] define Being in the universal sense as the principle of manifestation, and at the same time as comprising in itself the totality of possibilities of all manifestation, we must say that Being is not infinite because it does not coincide with total Possibility; and all the more so because Being, as the principle of manifestation, although it does indeed comprise all the possibilities of manifestation, does so only insofar as they are actually manifested. Outside of Being, therefore, are all the rest, that is all the possibilities of non-manifestation, as well as the possibilities of manifestation themselves insofar as they are in the unmanifested state; and included among these is Being itself, which cannot belong to manifestation since it is the principle thereof, and in consequence is itself unmanifested. For want of any other term, we are obliged to designate all that is thus outside and beyond Being as \"Non-Being\", but for us this negative term is in no way synonym for 'nothingness'.\n\nIn his book \"Perspectives on initiation\", Guénon clarifies the signification given by the ancient Greeks to the classical names of \"lesser\" and \"greater\" mysteries: \"they are not different \"types\" of initiations, but stages or degrees of a same initiation\".\n\nLesser mysteries lead to the \"perfection of the human state\", in other words to \"something traditionally designated by the restoration of the \"primordial state\", a state that Dante, in the Divine comedy, relates symbolically to the \"terrestrial paradise\". On another hand, \"greater mysteries\" refer properly to \"the realization of supra-human states\"; they correspond to the Hindu doctrine of \"deliverance\" (Moksha) and to what Islamic esoterism calls the \"realization of the Universal Man\": in that latter tradition, \"lesser\" and \"greater\" \"mysteries\" correspond exactly to the signification of the terms \"el-insân el-qadîm\" (the Primordial Man) and \"el-insan el-kâmil\" (the Universal Man). These two phases are related to an interpretation of the symbolism of the cross with the notions of \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" realization. They also correspond respectively to what is traditionally designated in \"western hermeticism\" by the terms \"royal initiation\" and \"sacerdotal initiation\".\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that symbolism refers to something very different from a mere 'code', an artificial or arbitrary meaning, and that \"it holds an essential and spontaneous echoing power\", for René Guénon, this 'echoing power' goes immensely farther than the psychological realm: symbolism is \"the metaphysical language at its highest\", capable of relating all degrees of universal Manifestation, and all the components of the Being as well: symbolism is the means by which man is capable of \"assenting\" orders of reality that escape, by their very nature, any description by ordinary language. This understanding of the profound nature of symbolism, writes René Guénon, has never been lost by an intellectual (i.e. spiritual) elite in the East. It is inherent in the transmission of initiation which, he says, gives the real key to man to penetrate the deeper meaning of the symbols; in this perspective, meditation on symbols (visual or heard, dhikr, repetition of the Divine Names) is an integral part both of initiation and of spiritual realization.\n\nFor René Guénon art is above all knowledge and understanding, rather than merely a matter of sensitivity. Similarly, the symbolism has a conceptual vastness \"not exclusive to a mathematical rigor\": symbolism is before all a science, and it is based, in its most general signification, on \"connections that exist between different levels of reality\". And, in particular, the analogy itself, understood following a formula used in Hermeticism as the \"relation of what is down with what is above\" is likely to be symbolized: there are symbols of the analogy (but every symbol is not necessarily the expression of an analogy, because there are correspondences that are not analogical). The analogical relation essentially involves the consideration of an \"inverse direction of its two terms\", and symbols of the analogy, which are generally built on the consideration of the primitive six-spoke wheel, also called the chrism in the Christian iconography, indicate clearly the consideration of these \"inverse directions\"; in the symbol of the Solomon's seal, the two triangles in opposition represent two opposing ternaries, \"one of which is like a reflection or mirror image of the other\" and \"this is where this symbol is an exact representation of analogy\". This consideration of a \"reverse meaning\" allows René Guénon to propose an explanation of some artistic depictions, such as that reported by Ananda Coomaraswamy in his study \"The inverted tree\": some images of the \"World Tree\", a symbol of universal Manifestation, represent the tree with its roots up and its branches down: the corresponding positions correspond to two complementary points of view that can be contemplated: point of view of the manifestation and of the Principle. This consideration of \"reverse meaning\" is one of the elements of a \"science of symbolism\" in which Guénon refers to, and used by him in many occasions.\n\nGuénon was critical of modern interpretations regarding symbolism which often rested on naturalistic interpretations of the symbol in question which Guénon regarded as a case of the symbol of the thing being mistaken for the thing itself. He was also critical of the psychological interpretations found in the psychiatrist Carl Jung.\n\nGuénon denounced the Theosophical Society, many pseudo-Masonic orders in the French and Anglo-Saxon occult scenes and the Spiritist movement. They formed the topic of two of his major books written in the 1920s, \"Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion\" and \"The Spiritist Fallacy\". He denounced the syncretic tendencies of many of these groups, along with the common Eurocentric misconceptions that accompanied their attempts to interpret Eastern doctrines. René Guénon especially develops some aspects of what he refers to as the manifestation of \"antitraditional\" currents in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His first book on that subject is devoted to a detailed historical examination of Madame Blavatsky's theosophy: \"Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion\". Guénon examines the role and intervention that played in that movement organizations that are described in more detail in \"The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times\", as under what he called the \"pseudo-initiation\"; in particular what he calls \"pseudo-Rosicrucian\" organizations holding no affiliation with the real authentic Rosicrucians, like the \"Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia\" founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little, the \"Order of the esoteric Rose-Cross\" of Dr. Franz Hartmann etc. He denounces the syncretic nature of theosophy and its connection with the theory of evolution in \"The Secret Doctrine\" (Madame Blavastky's main work); he also examines the role and relationship that the Theosophical Society had with multitude of \"pseudo-initiatic\" organizations, among others the O.T.O. founded in 1895 by Carl Kellner and propagated in 1905 by Theodor Reuss, and the Golden Dawn, to which belongs a large number of key figures of the Anglo-Saxon \"neo-spiritualism\" of the early twentieth century etc. Some authors have argued that Guénon's analysis of Theosophy is flawed and that it is debatable whether Theosophy is really hostile to Islam and Christianity.\n\nThese are precisely some members of the \"inner circle\" of the H.B. of L., to which belonged Emma Hardinge Britten, who would have produced the phenomena giving rise to spiritist movement that is to say, another \"antitraditional\" current born in 1848. To support this assertion, he relies on statements from Emma Hardinge Britten herself, which will be confirmed much later, in 1985, by the publication from French publishing house \"Editions Archè\" of the documents of the H.B. of L. This organization would have received in part the legacy of other secret societies, including the \"Eulis Brotherhood\", to which belonged Paschal Beverly Randolph, a character designated by René Guénon as \"very enigmatic\" who died in 1875. He denounces \"the confusion of the psychic and the spiritual\" and especially the psychoanalytic interpretation of symbols, including the Jungian branch of it, which he condemned with the greatest firmness, seeing in it the beginnings of a reversed – or at least distorted – interpretation of symbols. This aspect is reflected in some studies, especially in a book published in 1999 by Richard Noll who incidentally speaks of the role played by the Theosophical Society in Jung.\n\nA commentator of René Guénon, Charles-André Gilis, has published a book in 2009 which proposes some insights and developments of the idea of 'counter-tradition' introduced by Guénon, based on Mohyddin Ibn Arabi's writings (\"The profanation of Israël in the light of Sacred Law\").\n\nGuénon is commonly linked to the Traditionalist School, also called \"perennialism\", although Guénon never used the term of Traditionalist School or perennialism in his works. Beside Guénon, the principal thinkers in this tradition are Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon. Other important thinkers in this tradition include Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, Huston Smith, Hossein Nasr, Jean Borella, Julius Evola and William Chittick. The central belief of this school is the existence of a \"perennial wisdom\", or perennial philosophy, which says that there are primordial and universal truths which form the source for, and are shared by all the major world religions.\n\nThe impact of Guénon's work has been very broad, including many artists, in particular in the surrealist movement. For instance, writers and artists influenced by Guénon include Alain Danielou, André Malraux, Albert Gleizes, André Breton, Antonin Artaud, Marco Pallis, René Daumal, Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille and Paul Ackerman. René Guénon had a discrete impact in the field of comparative religion, particularly on the young Mircea Eliade and on contemporary scholars such as Huston Smith, William Chittick, Harry Oldmeadow, James Cutsinger and Hossein Nasr. For instance, Carl Schmitt wrote in 1942 that Guénon was an important \"teacher\" for Mircea Eliade. However, Eliade also wrote that he preferred the writings of the tradionalist Ananda Coomaraswamy to both Guénon and Evola, whom he defined as \"dilettantes\" in an essay written in 1937, and Eliade also thought that Sri Aurobindo was more \"perfected\" than Guénon.\n\nJust before and after World War I, Guénon was close to some circles of the far right Action Française including Léon Daudet, Jacques Bainville and, above all, the major Catholic philosopher Maritain (Maritain, as many Catholics, left the Action française later on). The main goal of Guénon during this period was to convince Maritain and the Catholic Church to revitalize Christianity through a dialogue with oriental religions and he envisaged a restoration of traditional \"intellectualité\" in the West on the basis of Roman Catholicism and Freemasonry. The project was unsuccessful. Several authors see in Guénon a successor of the monarchist, ultramontanist Joseph de Maistre, who was a Freemason like Guénon. Guénon's second book was published by a publishing house (Nouvelle Librairie Nationale directed by Maritain at that time) associated with the Action Française, and he also wished for his first book to be published there (it was published finally in the publishing house of the syndicalist Marcel Rivière). Among Guénon's acquaintances was also George Valois, who was at first an Anarcho-syndicalist, later member of the Action Française, founder of the fascist Faisceau and finally member of the French Resistance who died in a concentration camp, and Pierre Winter (former member of the Faisceau party).\n\nEven though Guénon repeated on many occasions that he was apolitical and that he rejected in advance any political interpretation of his work, he has been sometimes associated with far right and anti-democratic politics and he also influenced several writers who are on the far right of the political spectrum. The main reason is the fact that he had a strong influence on Julius Evola with whom he kept up an epistolary correspondence. For instance, Evola wrote that \"Guénon's deductions assume a radical character: hierarchical, aristocratic, anti-individualist, anti-social and anti-collectivist.\" In the same line, Robert Horvath wrote that Guénon refused not only the principle of equality, democratism and liberalism, but also socialism. In addition, Carl Schmitt, the \"crown jurist of the Nazi Third Reich\", told scholar of comparative religion Mircea Eliade that he regarded René Guénon as “the most interesting man alive today”. Guénon has influenced Schmitt in formulating his theory of the Absolute State and the forces that work against it.\n\nHowever, several studies dismiss any intellectual connection between Guénon and monarchist, far right politics. In a study based on the correspondences exchanged between Guénon and Evola and also some articles, P.-G. de Roux has pointed the harsh criticism of Guénon against Evola. In the same manner, in his book \"Guénon ou le renversement des clartés\", French scholar Xavier Accart disputes the connection made between the Traditionalist school and the far right movements. He claims, for instance, that Guenon was highly critical of Evola's political involvements and was worried about the possible confusion between his own ideas and Evola's. Guénon also clearly denounced the ideology of the fascist regimes in Europe before and during the Second World War. Guénon consented to having extracts of his writings published in the fascist newspaper \"Regime fascista\", a newspaper curated by Evola, but always refused to publish Evola's books and articles. Some authors consider that Evola should not be considered a member of the Traditionalist school due to the large differences between his thought and that of Guénon. A well known if controversial definition by Bergier and Louis Pauwels defined Adolf Hitler as Guénon plus the 'Panzerdivisonen'. However, Pauwels recognized himself on the radio later that the connection between Guénon and Hitler was totally wrong. In addition, Guénon also influenced many leftist or even apolitical writers and artists.\n\nHowever, Guénon has remained on the reading lists of the New Right. The work of Russian New Right author Aleksander Dugin is influenced by René Guénon and Julius Evola. Dugin repeatedly claimed Guénon as one of his teachers, and even suggested naming Rostov State University after Guénon. Italian neo-fascist and convicted terrorist Vincenzo Vinciguerra quoted Guenon and Evola in justification of his assassinations and bombings. Italian far right and anti-semitic writer Claudio Mutti was also influenced by Evola and Guénon. However, Alain de Benoist, the founder of the New Right declared in 2013 on the radio that the influence of Guénon on his political school has been globally very weak. In addition, Guénon was an outspoken opponent of the concept of Aryan race or Indo-European race and of any form of nationalism.\n\nBiographers also recall that Guénon disclaimed in his writings any connection to a \"school\" or \"movement\". George Santayana compared him to C. S. Lewis. The religious scholar Huston Smith acknowledges a debt to Guénon and the Traditionalist School while remaining outside the school as an academic.\n\n\nNew English translation, 23 volumes, Sophia Perennis (publisher)\n\n\n\n"}

He studied philosophy at the Jesuit Faculty of Philosophy in Kraków from 1955-1958 and theology at the Jesuit Faculty of Theology: Bobolanum in Warsaw from 1958-1962. Afterwards, he continued his philosophical studies at the Gregorian University in Rome from 1963-1966, where he obtained a Ph.D, and in Munich from 1966/67. Since 1990 he had been a full professor (professor ordinarius).\n\nSince 1967, Darowski had been a lecturer in philosophy, mainly in philosophical anthropology, at the Jesuit Faculty of Philosophy in Kraków, now Akademia Ignatianum. He would then become a dean of the Faculty of Philosophy (1968-1982, 1994-1997, and 2001–2007); rector of the Jesuit College in Kraków (1978-1984); founder and the first editor (1996-2006) of a multilingual review called \"Forum Philosophicum\"; and member of the Committee for the History of Science and Technology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\n\nDarowski published mainly in the field of philosophical anthropology and in the field of the history of philosophy in Poland, especially that of the Jesuits. He has published 15 books and over 300 articles – over 50 of them in foreign languages.\n\nDarowski’s philosophical views are presented most clearly in his books: \"Filozofia człowieka\" [Philosophy of Man, 5 Polish editions] and \"Philosophical Anthropology.

He also takes into consideration new currents of philosophical thought, especially the personalistic and axiological tendencies, but also, in some fashion, the dialogical one (cf. \"Philosophical Anthropology\", especially the chapter entitled “Human Being as a Dialogical Being”, pp. 123–126). He does not avoid the new achievements of the life sciences; instead, he attempts to integrate them with philosophy (cf. the chapters entitled “Human Corporeality”, pp. 38–43, and “The Origin of Human Being”, pp. 95–99 of the work just mentioned). Especially in its initial stages, there are many elements in his application of his method resembling a phenomenological description.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5094956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5094956", "title": "Sin Chaeho", "text": "Sin Chaeho\n\nSin Chaeho, or Shin Chae-ho (1880–1936), was a Korean independence activist, historian, anarchist, nationalist, and a founder of Korean ethnic nationalist historiography (민족 사학, \"minjok sahak\"; sometimes shortened to \"minjok\"). He is held in high esteem in both North and South Korea. Two of his works, \"A New Reading of History\" (\"Doksa Sillon\"), written in 1908, and \"The Early History of Joseon\" (\"Joseon Sanggosa\"), published in 1931, are considered key works of nationalist historiography in modern Korea. He argued that modern Koreans and the people of Manchuria were of a single race which has an ancestral claim to both Korea and Manchuria, Shin also studied Korean mythology. During his exile in China, Shin joined the Eastern Anarchist Association and wrote anti-imperialist and pro-independence articles in various outlets; his anarchist activities lead to his arrest and subsequent death in prison, February 21, 1936.\n\nShin was born on November 7, 1880. His grandfather was an official in the royal advisory department. His pen name was \"Dansaeng\", which he later changed to \"Danjae\". Shin was taught various Neo-Confucian books and concepts by his grandfather, and later enrolled in the Confucian academy \"Seonggyungwan\", receiving a doctoral degree in 1905. Shin, to a limited capacity, read Italian literature and history and published some Italian-related works; There is some speculation that Dante might be an influence on Shin Chae-ho's work, in particular \"Dream Sky\" (1916).\n\nShin went on to work for the editorial boards for two newspapers, the \"Hwangseong Shinmun\" (Hangul: 황성신문; Hanja: 皇城新聞) and the \"Daehan Maeil Shinbo\" (대한매일신보; 大韓每日新報), and became the leader of the underground \"patriotic enlightenment\" group, the \"Sinminhoe\". His group would later migrate to Manchuria in 1910 and attract such radicals as Yi Tong-hwi, a Korean Bolshevik who participated in \"The Conspiracy case of 1911,\" which was an effort to assassinate Japanese Governor-General Terauchi, leading to the arrests of several \"Sinminhoe\" members and eventually the dissolution of the \"Sinminhoe\".\n\nShin went into voluntary exile in 1910 when Japan declared its annexation of Korea; he then traveled to Vladivostok, then throughout China. Shin never returned to Korea, and since he refused to file for citizenship with the Empire of Japan he became stateless. Shin avoided politicized organizations until the March First Independence Movement, in 1919, which spurred him to join the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai. Shin quickly became frustrated with the Provisional Government, culminating in a clash with interim leader Syngman Rhee (\"I Seung-man\") and Shin leaving to embrace anarchism and draft the \"Declaration of Korean Revolution\" for the Righteous Brotherhood (\"Uiyeoldan\") in 1923. Shin went on to join the Eastern Anarchist Association (동방 무정부주의 연맹; 東方無政府主義聯盟) in 1926.\n\nShin was arrested by the Japanese Military Police in Taiwan in May 1928 for the attempted smuggling of 12,000 yuan in forged banknotes out of Taiwan under the pseudonym \"Yu Byeong-taek\" (유병택; 柳烟澤) in an effort to help fund the Eastern Anarchist Association's general activities and bomb factory. He was sentenced to a 10-year prison term by the Dalian District Court to be served in Lüshun Prison. Shin died while in solitary confinement at Lüshun Prison of a brain hemorrhage on the 21st of February, 1936. The Republic of Korea posthumously awarded Shin with the \"Presidential Order of Merit for National Foundation\" in 1962 and citizenship on April 13, 2013.\n\nShin Chae-ho wrote extensively on a theory of ethnic history which sought to challenge traditional border concepts in Korea and encourage Korean nationalism. This theory is broadly referred to as the Korean \"minjok\" (민족; 民族); An early form of the \"minjok\" is found in his article \"New History Reader.\" Shin's \"minjok\" works contested the traditional conception of Korea as a geographically defined \"peninsular nation\" (반도 국; \"pandoguk\"), which was born out of politics associated with the \"Mandate of Heaven\" in classical Chinese political philosophy. This Chinese hegemony was interpreted as Sinocentric by Shin, and others, as it placed border control in the hands of the Chinese Court.\n\nShin's \"minjok\" historiographical work traced a nation's history by its racial genealogy and lineage, relying on heritable race and culture. The \"minjok\" was defined by the terms of its history, and history was shaped by the \"minjok\", hence these two concepts were reciprocal and inseparable. For Shin, \"if one dismisses the \"minjok\", there is no history\"; to ignore or to down-play the \"minjok\" was to devitalize history itself.\n\nWithin the greater \"minjok\" history of a nation there was a host race, the \"chujok\" (주족); the identification of the \"chujok\" was necessary for tracing the authentic history of a nation, and solidified an ethnocentric national history. For Korea, the \"chujok\" was the ancient Korean-Manchurian Kingdom of the Buyeo (부여; 夫餘), which, by Shin's estimate, began 5,000 years ago with the birth of Dangun, the legendary son of a bear who was transformed into a human by the god Whanin. By combining mythology and genealogy, a common ancestry of Koreans and Manchurians was traced, effectively making them family. Shin thereby attempted to erase the geographical border between Korea and Manchuria in favour of ethnic re-unification.\n\nDistinct from the \"minjok\" was the state, the \"gukga\" (국가; 國家; or \"kukka\"). The \"minjok\" as a more basal concept than the \"gukga\" and did not substantially change between generations, whereas the \"gukga\" could change between kingdoms, government, and rules.\n\nBy defining the \"minjok\" as a rich and powerful ethnic history, Shin constructed an anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism social defence. Largely, the goal was rejection of both Chinese and Japanese governmental oversight and influence. Contemporaneous Japanese historians also argued that Koreans and Manchurians were the same group, but their efforts were to prove Korea was historically indistinct from other nations and thus mitigate Korea's importance.\n\nShin is sometimes called a social Darwinist, a popular concept in the early 20th century. Within Shin's work, the Manchurian-Korean Buyeo \"minjok\" is interpreted as the standard of measure for historical progress in Korea. Shin described a racial history of conflict between the various races of East Asia, as well as a political history. Towards this progress, Shin's \"minjok\" project was laid out in terms of racial victories: specifically for the Buyeo, victory would be complete reunification of the race and then-on defending against cultural assimilation and imperialism.\n\nThis \"Darwinian-Spencerian\" framework, which prized ethnic nationalism and purity, allowed Shin to write a race-centred history of Korea that attempted to shut down the Japanese colonial justifications by conjoining ethnic history and progress, necessarily making harmful the adulteration of Korean society with Japanese culture, not a progressive one. This is somewhat analogous to Nordicism, or progressivist ethnography, but from a Korean-centric perspective.\n\nShin did not describe Korea as the \"victor\" of these racial battles. Shin described a slow fall of the \"minjok\", primarily attributing a high point to King Muyeol of Silla, and then descent through the fall of Barhae and slow fracturing of Korean social unity through politics and war. Shin praised the Koryeo and Choseon dynasties, but insisted that the successes that they brought were only partial, lamenting that if scholars \"are searching for a full unification, it cannot be found after Tangun.\"\n\nShin Chae-ho is often credited as the primary source in the \"Juche\" (주체; 主體; meaning \"Self-reliance\" or \"Autonomy\"; sometimes spelt \"Chuch'e\") political ideology. \"Juche\" aspires towards a country's complete autonomy, both in a national sense and in an historical sense. However, it is not clear whether the North Korean \"Juche\" is modelled upon or is merely similar to Shin's \"Juche\". Scholars such as Sheila Miyoshi Jager have written that strong references about the history of North Korean ideology are uncommon, but similarities in language, symbolism, and the concepts make Shin Chae-ho a good candidate as an influence on Kim Il Sung and his own \"Juche\" state ideology. Shin's \"Juche\" concept is also specifically Korean; however it bears a likeness to Japanese \"Kokutai\" (국체; \"Kukche\").\n\nShin Chae-ho's anarchist philosophy is largely ignored by contemporary Korean scholars. One of his later works, \"The Dream Sky\", is considered one of these anarchist-themed works, and explores themes of \"clear understanding,\" an individual's \"own way\", and praises \"human struggle\" as a righteous path. The book also challenged literary standards by ending on an ellipsis and breaking historical continuity by borrowing characters from Korean history.\n\nIn South Korea, after the emancipation from Japan, Shin was not considered an important author. The term \"minjok\" was decried as politically unacceptable by Shin's old acquaintance from the Provisional Government, and now the first president of South Korea, Syngman Rhee. The new South Korean government favoured the term \"kukka\", which implied loyalty to the Republic of Korea, over Shin's \"minjok\". In the 1960s, Rhee's political regime ended and anti-imperialism sentiments redoubled, followed by scholars pursuing a new autonomous history of Korea, and revived the term \"minjok\". By 1908, Shin Chae-ho had become a powerful figure in Korean historiography, but concepts like \"minjok\", among others, are interpreted in ways that favour the South Korean Government over the North's.\n\nThe Park military regime in South Korea pushed for capitalist economic development, noting that dismantling the North Korean communist state would do the \"minjok saengjon\" good. Following nationalist trends, some South Korean \"Minjung\" movements made appeals to national self-reliance (\"minjok juchesung\").\n\nNorth Korea also sponsored re-reading Shin, among other Korean authors. In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Il Sung is said to be the leader of the \"minjok\", and follows similar genealogical tracings of Koreans into ancient Korean-Manchuria.\n\nShin Chae-ho is held in high esteem by North Korea and made a lasting impact on the Korean perception of Japan and imperialism generally. Two of his works, \"Doksa Sillon\" (\"A New Reading of History\"), written in 1908, and \"Joseon Sanggosa\" (\"The Early History of Joseon\"), published in 1931, are particularly important in the nationalist historiography of modern Korea.\n\nA consequence of Shin's nationalistic thought might be the discouragement of the Korean diaspora—the closer a Korean was to Korean soil the closer they were to their cultural \"space.\" For Shin, space, culture, and patriotism became inseparable. A worry of some Koreans is their ethno-cultural continuation, and the loss of \"Korean-ness\" as Koreans either travel abroad or adopt foreign customs.\n\nShin Chae-ho's high standards of education and early enrollment of children in school (at age 4) were criticized as excessive. He responded that some four-year-olds already knew the first one thousand characters in Chinese and that some had already begun the Children's First Learning Programme (\"Dongmong seonseup\"). He also argued that historical standards of education were steeper than the contemporary standards. All the while, Shin believed all Korean citizens should learn both Hangul and Hanja to aid in preserving Korean identity, rather than subject thdemselves to the Chinese language system, and to study Korean patriotic literature.\n\nAs part of the \"minjok\" historiography, Shin rebuked some scholars for focusing too much on geography and borders rather than \"minjok\" ethnic boundaries; he called these scholars \"territorial historians\". However, his own works consistently employed territorial terms, boundaries, borders that only differ by how Shin justified them by a very ancient Korea, while the \"territorial historians'\" terms are usually traced to younger Chinese courts. This is aggravated by the fact that Shin had few, if any, compelling references for his historical claims, making his boundaries largely arbitrary or folk-history based.\n\nShin Chae-ho's \"Dream Sky\" at times resembles Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". If Shin had knowingly presented a Korean-ized \"Divine Comedy\" as an authentic work of Korean fiction, it would be an adulteration of the \"minjok\" historiography project by Shin's own standards of ethno-cultural autonomy. Whether or not Shin even read Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" is purely speculative.\n\nShin Chae-ho wrote at least 12 novels and 28 poems (17 Chinese, 3 Sijo style); he also wrote essays on literary criticism, articles published in news papers and journals, historical books, and a translation of \"Three Great Founders of Italy\" from Chinese into Korean.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "315006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315006", "title": "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", "text": "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962; second edition 1970; third edition 1996; fourth edition 2012) is a book about the history of science by the philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn. Its publication was a landmark event in the history, philosophy, and sociology of scientific knowledge. Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in \"normal science\". Normal scientific progress was viewed as \"development-by-accumulation\" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of such conceptual continuity in normal science were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science. The discovery of \"anomalies\" during revolutions in science leads to new paradigms. New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere \"puzzle-solving\" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the \"map\" directing new research.\n\nFor example, Kuhn's analysis of the Copernican Revolution emphasized that, in its beginning, it did not offer more accurate predictions of celestial events, such as planetary positions, than the Ptolemaic system, but instead appealed to some practitioners based on a promise of better, simpler, solutions that might be developed at some point in the future. Kuhn called the core concepts of an ascendant revolution its \"paradigms\" and thereby launched this word into widespread analogical use in the second half of the 20th century. Kuhn's insistence that a paradigm shift was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise, but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his work. Kuhn addressed concerns in the 1969 postscript to the second edition. For some commentators \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" introduced a realistic humanism into the core of science, while for others the nobility of science was tarnished by Kuhn's introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its greatest achievements.\n\n\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" was first published as a monograph in the \"International Encyclopedia of Unified Science\", then as a book by University of Chicago Press in 1962. In 1969, Kuhn added a postscript to the book in which he replied to critical responses to the first edition. A 50th Anniversary Edition (with an introductory essay by Ian Hacking) was published by the University of Chicago Press in April 2012.\n\nKuhn dated the genesis of his book to 1947, when he was a graduate student at Harvard University and had been asked to teach a science class for humanities undergraduates with a focus on historical case studies. Kuhn later commented that until then, \"I'd never read an old document in science.\" Aristotle's \"Physics\" was astonishingly unlike Isaac Newton's work in its concepts of matter and motion. Kuhn wrote \"... as I was reading him, Aristotle appeared not only ignorant of mechanics, but a dreadfully bad physical scientist as well. About motion, in particular, his writings seemed to me full of egregious errors, both of logic and of observation.\" This was in an apparent contradiction with the fact that Aristotle was a brilliant mind. While perusing Aristotle's \"Physics\", Kuhn formed the view that in order to properly appreciate Aristotle's reasoning, one must be aware of the scientific conventions of the time. Kuhn concluded that Aristotle's concepts were not \"bad Newton,\" just different. This insight was the foundation of \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\".\n\nPrior to the publication of Kuhn’s book, a number of ideas regarding the process of scientific investigation and discovery had already been proposed. Ludwik Fleck developed the first system of the sociology of scientific knowledge in his book \"The Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact\" (1935). He claimed that the exchange of ideas led to the establishment of a thought collective, which, when developed sufficiently, served to separate the field into esoteric (professional) and exoteric (laymen) circles. Kuhn wrote the foreword to the 1979 edition of Fleck's book, noting that he read it in 1950 and was reassured that someone \"saw in the history of science what I myself was finding there.\"\n\nKuhn was not confident about how his book would be received. Harvard University had denied his tenure, a few years before. However, by the mid-1980s, his book had achieved blockbuster status. \n\nOne theory to which Kuhn replies directly is Karl Popper’s “falsificationism,” which stresses falsifiability as the most important criterion for distinguishing between that which is scientific and that which is unscientific. Kuhn also addresses verificationism, a philosophical movement that emerged in the 1920s among logical positivists. The verifiability principle claims that meaningful statements must be supported by empirical evidence or logical requirements.\n\nKuhn's approach to the history and philosophy of science focuses on conceptual issues like the practice of normal science, influence of historical events, emergence of scientific discoveries, nature of scientific revolutions and progress through scientific revolutions. What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing traditional thought to earlier investigators, Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities. Such an approach is largely commensurate with the general historical school of non-linear history.\n\nKuhn did not see scientific theory as proceeding linearly from an objective, unbiased accumulation of all available data, but rather as paradigm-driven. “The operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the laboratory are not ‘the given’ of experience but rather ‘the collected with diffculty.’ They are not what the scientist sees—at least not before his research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are concrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as such they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only because they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an accepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience from which they in part derive, operations and measurements are paradigm-determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations.”\nKuhn explains his ideas using examples taken from the history of science. For instance, eighteenth century scientists believed that homogenous solutions were chemical compounds. Therefore, a combination of water and alcohol was generally classified as a \"compound\". Nowadays it is considered to be a \"solution\", but there was no reason then to suspect that it was not a compound. Water and alcohol would not separate spontaneously, nor will they separate completely upon distillation (they form an azeotrope). Water and alcohol can be combined in any proportion.\n\nUnder this paradigm, scientists believed that chemical reactions (such as the combination of water and alcohol) did not necessarily occur in fixed proportion. This belief was ultimately overturned by Dalton’s atomic theory, which asserted that atoms can only combine in simple, whole-number ratios. Under this new paradigm, any reaction which did not occur in fixed proportion could not be a chemical process. This type world-view transition among the scientific community exemplifies Kuhn's paradigm shift.\n\nA famous example of a revolution in scientific thought is the Copernican Revolution. In Ptolemy's school of thought, cycles and epicycles (with some additional concepts) were used for modeling the movements of the planets in a cosmos that had a stationary Earth at its center. As accuracy of celestial observations increased, complexity of the Ptolemaic cyclical and epicyclical mechanisms had to increase to maintain the calculated planetary positions close to the observed positions. Copernicus proposed a cosmology in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth was one of the planets revolving around it. For modeling the planetary motions, Copernicus used the tools he was familiar with, namely the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic toolbox. Yet Copernicus' model needed more cycles and epicycles than existed in the then-current Ptolemaic model, and due to a lack of accuracy in calculations, his model did not appear to provide more accurate predictions than the Ptolemy model. Copernicus' contemporaries rejected his cosmology, and Kuhn asserts that they were quite right to do so: Copernicus' cosmology lacked credibility.\n\nKuhn illustrates how a paradigm shift later became possible when Galileo Galilei introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but unless something keeps pushing it, it will eventually stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.\n\nGalileo put forward a bold alternative conjecture: suppose, he said, that we always observe objects coming to a halt simply because some friction is always occurring. Galileo had no equipment with which to objectively confirm his conjecture, but he suggested that without any friction to slow down an object in motion, its inherent tendency is to maintain its speed without the application of any additional force.\n\nThe Ptolemaic approach of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: there seemed to be no end to the mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler was the first person to abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.\n\nGalileo's conjecture was merely that — a conjecture. So was Kepler's cosmology. But each conjecture increased the credibility of the other, and together, they changed the prevailing perceptions of the scientific community. Later, Newton showed that Kepler's three laws could all be derived from a single theory of motion and planetary motion. Newton solidified and unified the paradigm shift that Galileo and Kepler had initiated.\n\nOne of the aims of science is to find models that will account for as many observations as possible within a coherent framework. Together, Galileo's rethinking of the nature of motion and Keplerian cosmology represented a coherent framework that was capable of rivaling the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic framework.\n\nOnce a paradigm shift has taken place, the textbooks are rewritten. Often the history of science too is rewritten, being presented as an inevitable process leading up to the current, established framework of thought. There is a prevalent belief that all hitherto-unexplained phenomena will in due course be accounted for in terms of this established framework. Kuhn states that scientists spend most (if not all) of their careers in a process of puzzle-solving. Their puzzle-solving is pursued with great tenacity, because the previous successes of the established paradigm tend to generate great confidence that the approach being taken guarantees that a solution to the puzzle exists, even though it may be very hard to find. Kuhn calls this process \"normal science\".\n\nAs a paradigm is stretched to its limits, \"anomalies\" — failures of the current paradigm to take into account observed phenomena — accumulate. Their significance is judged by the practitioners of the discipline. Some anomalies may be dismissed as errors in observation, others as merely requiring small adjustments to the current paradigm that will be clarified in due course. Some anomalies resolve themselves spontaneously, having increased the available depth of insight along the way. But no matter how great or numerous the anomalies that persist, Kuhn observes, the practicing scientists will not lose faith in the established paradigm until a credible alternative is available; to lose faith in the solvability of the problems would in effect mean ceasing to be a scientist.\n\nIn any community of scientists, Kuhn states, there are some individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a \"crisis\" exists, embark on what Kuhn calls \"revolutionary science\", exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear to be accompanied by numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a \"paradigm shift\" will have occurred.\n\nKuhn explains the process of scientific change as the result of various phases of paradigm change.\n\n\nA science may go through these cycles repeatedly, though Kuhn notes that it is a good thing for science that such shifts do not occur often or easily.\n\nAccording to Kuhn, the scientific paradigms preceding and succeeding a paradigm shift are so different that their theories are incommensurable — the new paradigm cannot be proven or disproven by the rules of the old paradigm, and vice versa. (A later interpretation by Kuhn of 'commensurable' versus 'incommensurable' was as a distinction between \"languages\", namely, that statements in commensurable languages were translatable fully from one to the other, while in \"in\"commensurable languages, strict translation is not possible.) The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, what questions are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.\nSuch incommensurability exists not just before and after a paradigm shift, but in the periods in between conflicting paradigms. It is simply not possible, according to Kuhn, to construct an impartial language that can be used to perform a neutral comparison between conflicting paradigms, because the very terms used are integral to the respective paradigms, and therefore have different connotations in each paradigm. The advocates of mutually exclusive paradigms are in a difficult position: \"Though each may hope to convert the other to his way of seeing science and its problems, neither may hope to prove his case. The competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle that can be resolved by proofs.\" Scientists subscribing to different paradigms end up talking past one another.\n\nKuhn states that the probabilistic tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall under one of the paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.\n\nKuhn further developed his ideas regarding incommensurability in the 1980s and 1990s. In his unpublished manuscript \"The Plurality of Worlds\", Kuhn introduces the theory of \"kind concepts:\" sets of interrelated concepts that are characteristic of a time period in a science and differ in structure from the modern analogous kind concepts. These different structures imply different “taxonomies” of things and processes, and this difference in taxonomies constitutes incommensurability. This theory is strongly naturalistic and draws on developmental psychology to “found a quasi-transcendental theory of experience and of reality.”\n\nKuhn introduced the concept of an exemplar in a postscript to the second edition of \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1970). He noted that he was substituting the term 'exemplars' for 'paradigm', meaning the problems and solutions that students of a subject learn from the beginning of their education. For example, physicists might have as exemplars the inclined plane, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, or instruments like the calorimeter.\n\nAccording to Kuhn, scientific practice alternates between periods of normal science and revolutionary science. During periods of normalcy, scientists tend to subscribe to a large body of interconnecting knowledge, methods, and assumptions which make up the reigning paradigm (see paradigm shift). Normal science presents a series of problems that are solved as scientists explore their field. The solutions to some of these problems become well known and are the exemplars of the field.\n\nThose who study a scientific discipline are expected to know its exemplars. There is no fixed set of exemplars, but for a physicist today it would probably include the harmonic oscillator from mechanics and the hydrogen atom from quantum mechanics.\n\nThe first edition of \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" ended with a chapter titled \"Progress through Revolutions\", in which Kuhn spelled out his views on the nature of scientific progress. Since he considered problem solving to be a central element of science, Kuhn saw that for a new candidate paradigm to be accepted by a scientific community, \"First, the new candidate must seem to resolve some outstanding and generally recognized problem that can be met in no other way. Second, the new paradigm must promise to preserve a relatively large part of the concrete problem solving activity that has accrued to science through its predecessors.\n\nWhile the new paradigm is rarely as expansive as the old paradigm in its initial stages, it must nevertheless have significant promise for future problem-solving. As a result, though new paradigms seldom or never possess all the capabilities of their predecessors, they usually preserve a great deal of the most concrete parts of past achievement and they always permit additional concrete problem-solutions besides.\n\nIn the second edition, Kuhn added a postscript in which he elaborated his ideas on the nature of scientific progress. He described a thought experiment involving an observer who has the opportunity to inspect an assortment of theories, each corresponding to a single stage in a succession of theories. What if the observer is presented with these theories without any explicit indication of their chronological order? Kuhn anticipates that it will be possible to reconstruct their chronology on the basis of the theories' scope and content, because the more recent a theory is, the better it will be as an instrument for solving the kinds of puzzle that scientists aim to solve. Kuhn remarked: \"That is not a relativist's position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.\"\n\n\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" has been credited with producing the kind of \"paradigm shift\" Kuhn discussed. Since the book’s publication, over one million copies have been sold, including translations into sixteen different languages. In 1987, it was reported to be the twentieth-century book most frequently cited in the period 1976–1983 in the arts and the humanities.\n\nThe first extensive review of \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" was authored by Dudley Shapere, a philosopher who interpreted Kuhn's work as a continuation of the anti-positivist sentiment of other philosophers of science, including Paul Feyerabend and Norwood Russell Hanson. Shapere noted the book’s influence on the philosophical landscape of the time, calling it “a sustained attack on the prevailing image of scientific change as a linear process of ever-increasing knowledge.” According to the philosopher Michael Ruse, Kuhn discredited the ahistorical and prescriptive approach to the philosophy of science of Ernest Nagel's \"The Structure of Science\" (1961). Kuhn's book sparked a historicist \"revolt against positivism\" (the so-called \"historical turn in philosophy of science\" which looked to the history of science as a source of data for developing a philosophy of science), although this may not have been Kuhn’s intention; in fact, he had already approached the prominent positivist Rudolf Carnap about having his work published in the \"International Encyclopedia of Unified Science\". The philosopher Robert C. Solomon noted that Kuhn's views have often been suggested to have an affinity to those of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Kuhn's view of scientific knowledge, as expounded in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", has been compared to the views of the philosopher Michel Foucault.\n\nThe first field to claim descent from Kuhn’s ideas was the sociology of scientific knowledge. Sociologists working within this new field, including Harry Collins and Steven Shapin, used Kuhn’s emphasis on the role of non-evidential community factors in scientific development to argue against logical empiricism, which discouraged inquiry into the social aspects of scientific communities. These sociologists expanded upon Kuhn’s ideas, arguing that scientific judgment is determined by social factors, such as professional interests and political ideologies.\n\nBarry Barnes detailed the connection between the sociology of scientific knowledge and Kuhn in his book \"T. S. Kuhn and Social Science.\" In particular, Kuhn’s ideas regarding science occurring within an established framework informed Barnes's own ideas regarding finitism, a theory wherein meaning is continuously changed (even during periods of normal science) by its usage within the social framework.\n\n\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" elicited a number of reactions from the broader sociological community. Following the book's publication, some sociologists expressed the belief that the field of sociology had not yet developed a unifying paradigm, and should therefore strive towards homogenization. Others argued that the field was in the midst of normal science, and speculated that a new revolution would soon emerge. Some sociologists, including John Urry, doubted that Kuhn's theory, which addressed the development of natural science, was necessarily relevant to sociological development.\n\nDevelopments in the field of economics are often expressed and legitimized in Kuhnian terms. For instance, neoclassical economists have claimed “to be at the second stage [normal science], and to have been there for a very long time – since Adam Smith, according to some accounts (Hollander, 1987), or Jevons according to others (Hutchison, 1978).” In the 1970s, Post Keynesian economists denied the coherence of the neoclassical paradigm, claiming that their own paradigm would ultimately become dominant.\n\nWhile perhaps less explicit, Kuhn’s influence remains apparent in recent economics. For instance, the abstract of Olivier Blanchard’s paper “The State of Macro” (2008) begins:\n\nIn 1974, \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" was ranked as the second most frequently used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhn’s theory has been used by political scientists to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable. The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a political scientists constituted a theory, or something else.\n\nThe changes that occur in politics, society and business are often expressed in Kuhnian terms, however poor their parallel with the practice of science may seem to scientists and historians of science. The terms \"paradigm\" and \"paradigm shift\" have become such notorious clichés and buzzwords that they are sometimes viewed as effectively devoid of content.\n\n\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" was soon criticized by Kuhn's colleagues in the history and philosophy of science. In 1965, a special symposium on the book was held at an International Colloquium on the Philosophy of Science that took place at Bedford College, London, and was chaired by Karl Popper. The symposium led to the publication of the symposium's presentations plus other essays, most of them critical, which eventually appeared in an influential volume of essays. Kuhn expressed the opinion that his critics' readings of his book were so inconsistent with his own understanding of it that he was \"...tempted to posit the existence of two Thomas Kuhns,\" one the author of his book, the other the individual who had been criticized in the symposium by \"Professors Popper, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Toulmin and Watkins.\"\n\nA number of the included essays question the existence of normal science. In his essay, Feyerabend suggests that Kuhn’s conception of normal science fits organized crime as well as it does science. Popper expresses distaste with the entire premise of Kuhn's book, writing, “the idea of turning for enlightenment concerning the aims of science, and its possible progress, to sociology or to psychology (or. . .to the history of science) is surprising and disappointing.”\n\nIn his 1972 work, \"Human Understanding\", Stephen Toulmin argued that a more realistic picture of science than that presented in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" would admit the fact that revisions in science take place much more frequently, and are much less dramatic than can be explained by the model of revolution/normal science. In Toulmin's view, such revisions occur quite often during periods of what Kuhn would call \"normal science.\" For Kuhn to explain such revisions in terms of the non-paradigmatic puzzle solutions of normal science, he would need to delineate what is perhaps an implausibly sharp distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic science.\n\nIn a series of texts published in the early 1970s, Carl R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this made it impossible to explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because they admit the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.\n\nKordig maintains that there is a common observational plane. For example, when Kepler and Tycho Brahe are trying to explain the relative variation of the distance of the sun from the horizon at sunrise, both see the same thing (the same configuration is focused on the retina of each individual). This is just one example of the fact that \"rival scientific theories share some observations, and therefore some meanings.\" Kordig suggests that with this approach, he is not reintroducing the distinction between observations and theory in which the former is assigned a privileged and neutral status, but that it is possible to affirm more simply the fact that, even if no sharp distinction exists between theory and observations, this does not imply that there are no comprehensible differences at the two extremes of this polarity.\n\nAt a secondary level, for Kordig there is a common plane of inter-paradigmatic standards or shared norms that permit the effective confrontation of rival theories.\n\nIn 1973, Hartry Field published an article that also sharply criticized Kuhn's idea of incommensurability. In particular, he took issue with this passage from Kuhn:\n\nField takes this idea of incommensurability between the same terms in different theories one step further. Instead of attempting to identify a persistence of the reference of terms in different theories, Field's analysis emphasizes the indeterminacy of reference within individual theories. Field takes the example of the term \"mass\", and asks what exactly \"mass\" means in modern post-relativistic physics. He finds that there are at least two different definitions:\n\n\nProjecting this distinction backwards in time onto Newtonian dynamics, we can formulate the following two hypotheses:\n\n\nAccording to Field, it is impossible to decide which of these two affirmations is true. Prior to the theory of relativity, the term \"mass\" was \"referentially indeterminate\". But this does not mean that the term \"mass\" did not have a different \"meaning\" than it now has. The problem is not one of meaning but of \"reference\". The reference of such terms as mass is only \"partially determined\": we don't really know how Newton intended his use of this term to be applied. As a consequence, neither of the two terms fully denotes (refers). It follows that it is improper to maintain that a term has changed its reference during a scientific revolution; it is more appropriate to describe terms such as \"mass\" as \"having undergone a denotional refinement.\"\n\nIn 1974, Donald Davidson objected that the concept of incommensurable scientific paradigms competing with each other is logically inconsistent. \"In his article Davidson goes well beyond the semantic version of the incommensurability thesis: to make sense of the idea of a language independent of translation requires a distinction between conceptual schemes and the content organized by such schemes. But, Davidson argues, no coherent sense can be made of the idea of a conceptual scheme, and therefore no sense may be attached to the idea of an untranslatable language.\"\n\nThe close connection between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs is at the root of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient \"conceives\" the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.\n\nJerry Fodor attempts to establish that this theoretical paradigm is fallacious and misleading by demonstrating the impenetrability of perception to the background knowledge of subjects. The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the Müller-Lyer illusion are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.\n\nIn epistemology, for example, the criticism of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then it is possible to maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is that it is necessary to distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.\n\nOther critics, such as Israel Scheffler, Hilary Putnam and Saul Kripke, have focused on the Fregean distinction between sense and reference in order to defend scientific realism. Scheffler contends that Kuhn confuses the meanings of terms such as \"mass\" with their referents. While their meanings may very well differ, their referents (the objects or entities to which they correspond in the external world) remain fixed.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35646487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35646487", "title": "Theodicy and the Bible", "text": "Theodicy and the Bible\n\nTheodicy, in its most common form, is the attempt to answer the question of why a good God permits the manifestation of evil. Theodicy attempts to resolve the evidential problem of evil by reconciling the traditional divine characteristics of omnibenevolence and omnipotence, in either their absolute or relative form, with the occurrence of evil or suffering in the world. “Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years,” and \"debates about theodicy continue among believers and unbelievers alike\".\n\nTheodicy is an \"intensely urgent\" and \"constant concern\" of \"the entire Bible\". Relating theodicy and the Bible is crucial to understanding Abrahamic theodicy because the Bible \"has been, both in theory and in fact, the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world\". The Bible raises the issue of theodicy by its portrayals of God as inflicting evil and by its accounts of people who question God's goodness by their angry indictments. However, the Bible \"contains no comprehensive theodicy\".\n\n\"The most common theodicy is the \"free will theodicy\".\" It lays the blame for all moral evil and some natural evil on humanity's misuse of its free will. This article shows that the free will theodicy interacts with the Bible at its core: what Jesus and Paul say about the freedom of the will and with what kind of freedom of the will God endowed humanity at the Creation.\n\nThe Bible contains numerous examples of God inflicting evil, both in the form of \"moral evil\" resulting from \"man's sinful inclinations\" and the \"physical evil\" of suffering. These two biblical uses of the word \"evil\" parallel the Oxford English Dictionary's definitions of the word as (a) \"morally evil\" and (b) \"discomfort, pain, or trouble.\" The Bible sometimes portrays God as inflicting evil in the generic sense\n\nIn other cases, the word \"evil\" refers to suffering. Suffering results from either (a) \"‘moral' evil, due to human volition\" or (b) \"‘physical' evil, directly due to nature.\" The Bible portrays God as inflicting evil in both senses because its writers \"regarded God as the ultimate Cause of evil.\" The Bible contains examples of suffering caused by nature that are attributed to God, as well as examples of suffering caused by humans that are attributed to God.\n\nBarry Whitney gives the reason why a theodicy is important for those who believe in the biblical God when he observes that \"it is the believer in God, more so than the skeptic, who is forced to come to terms with the problem of evil.\"\n\nBiblical scholar Walter Brueggemann observes that \"theodicy is a constant concern of the entire Bible,\" and he describes theodicy, from the biblical perspective, as a subject that \"concerns the question of God's goodness and power in a world that is manifestly marked by disorder and evil.\" The Bible evokes a need for a theodicy by its indictments of God coupled with expressions of anger at God, both of which question God's righteousness.\n\nTyron Inbody avers that \"there is no biblical theodicy.\" However, Inbody observes that the Bible proffers \"various solutions\" to questions about God and the evil of human suffering. These \"various solutions\" to the \"why\" of suffering and other evils are delineated in the Bible's \"responses\" (James Crenshaw) or \"approaches\" (Daniel J. Harrington) or \"answers\" (Bart Ehrman) to evil that these biblical scholars have identified. These scholars see a range of responses including punishment for sin, teaching or testing, or the means to some greater good.\n\nGregory Boyd, while appreciating \"expositions of various biblical motifs that explain why we suffer, goes on to warn that \"none of these motifs claim to be a comprehensive theodicy.\" In agreement with Boyd, Milton Crum comments that although such biblical passages might lessen the weight of suffering, ad hoc interpretations of evils do not provide a blanket theodicy. N. T. Wright \"reminds us\" that \"the scriptures are frustratingly indirect and incomplete in answering questions of theodicy.\"\n\nBrueggemann observes that, while the various biblical books do not agree on a theodicy, there was a temporary \"theodic settlement\" in the biblical Book of Deuteronomy.\n\nThe \"theodic settlement\" in the Book of Deuteronomy interprets all afflictions as just punishment for sin, that is, as retribution. Brueggemann defines \"the theological notion of retribution\" as \"the assumption or conviction that the world is ordered by God so that everyone receives a fair outcome of reward or punishment commensurate with his or her conduct.\" Brueggemann points to Psalm One as a succinct summary of this retribution theodicy: \"the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish\" (Psalm 1:6).\n\nDeuteronomy elaborates its \"theodic settlement\" in Chapter 28. Verse two promises that \"blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the Lord your God.\" This general promise of blessings is followed by a lengthy list of fourteen specific blessings. But, on the other hand, verse fifteen warns that \"if you will not obey the Lord your God . . . , curses shall come upon you.\" This general warning of curses is followed by a list of fifty-four specific curses, all of which would fit into the biblical use of the word \"evil.\"\n\nThe Deuteronomic retribution theodic settlement interpreted whatever evils (\"curses\") people suffered as just retribution meted out by a just God. However, at least as early as the early 6th century BC, Jeremiah was asserting that the retribution theodicy was contrary to fact. Jeremiah upbraided God for endowing the wicked with prosperity: \"Why does the way of the guilty prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive? You plant them, and they take root.\" \n\nIn John 9:1–34, Jesus dismisses this \"theodic settlement\" by explaining that \"It was neither that [a blind] man sinned, nor his parents [that caused his infirmity]; but it was so that the works of God might be displayed in him.\" \n\nBrueggemann treats the biblical Book of Job as the prime example of the \"newly voiced theodic challenges\" to the \"old [Deuteronomic] theodic settlement\" Job \"was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil,\" but nonetheless he suffered \"all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him.\" In the midst of his suffering, Job explicitly contradicted the Deuteronomic theodic settlement: \"it is all one; therefore I say, [God] destroys both the blameless and the wicked.\"\n\nNot only did Job challenge the Deuteronomic theodic settlement by the fact of his own innocent suffering and by explicit contradiction of the old settlement, he interrogated God, \"Why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power?\" Brueggemann judges the fact that God had no answer to Job's \"why?\" to be so important that \"the Book of Job turns on the refusal, unwillingness, or inability of [God] to answer\" Job's query. Even worse, God says of himself: \"...you [Satan] incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.\"\n\nBrueggemann explains that the \"turn\" he sees in the Book of Job is a turn from seeing the 'right' as accepting the old theodic settlement. Now, he continues, \"perhaps what is 'right' is Job's refusal to concede, and therefore what is celebrated is his entire defiant argument...That is, what Yahweh intends as ‘right' is that Job (Israel, humankind) should make a legitimate case\" before God \"without timidity or cowardice\" to \"carry the human question of justice into the danger zone of God's holiness.\"\n\nA theodicy is an attempt \"to reconcile the power and goodness attributed to God with the presence of evil in the human experience.\" The Bible attributes both \"power\" and \"goodness\" to God.\n\nThe free will theodicy, first developed by Augustine, defends God by placing all the blame for evil on \"the misuse of free will by human beings.\" This free will theodicy is \"perhaps the most influential theodicy ever constructed,\" and it is currently \"the most common theodicy\"\n\nExplaining the free will theodicy, Nick Trakakis writes that \"the free will theodicist proceeds to explain the existence of moral evil as a consequence of the misuse of our freedom.\" Then \"the free will theodicist adds, however, that the value of free will (and the goods it makes possible) is so great as to outweigh the risk that it may be misused in various ways.\"\n\nIn parallel with the free will theodicy, \"The New Bible Dictionary\" finds that the Bible attributes evil \"to the abuse of free-will.\" Others have noted the free will theodicy's \"compatibility with and reliance upon the [biblical Book of] Genesis account of creation\" and the fall of Adam and Eve into sin. Because of the compatibility between the free will theodicy and the Genesis account of the Creation and Fall of humanity \"the Fall-doctrine\" has been characterized as \"fundamentally an exercise in theodicy-making.\"\n\nThe two terms, \"freedom\" and \"free will,\" are treated together (a) because, by definition, a \"free will\" means a \"will\" that possesses \"freedom\" and (b) because \"free will\" is \"commonly used\" as synonymous with \"freedom.\" Likewise, Robert Kane, writing about \"what is often called the free will issue or the problem of free will,\" says that it \"is really a cluster of problems or questions revolving around the conception of human freedom\"\n\nIn writing about free will, R. C. Sproul points out that \"at the heart of the problem is the question of the definition of free will.\" Manual Vargas adds that \"it is not clear that there is any single thing that people have had in mind by the term ‘free will'.\"\nBecause of the confusion created when \"definitions of \"free will\" are assumed without being stated,\" Randy Alcorn urges, \"be sure to define terms.\"\n\nMortimer Adler recognized the confusion resulting from the fact that there are \"several different objects men have in mind when they use the word \"freedom\".\" In \"The Idea of Freedom\", Adler resolved this confusion by distinguishing the \"three kinds of freedom\" that various writers have in mind when they use the word. He calls these three kinds of freedom (1) \"circumstantial freedom,\" (2) \"natural freedom,\" and (3) \"acquired freedom.\" \"Natural freedom\" and \"acquired freedom\" are germane to the Bible in relation to the free will theodicy.\n\n\"Natural freedom,\" in Adler's terminology, is the freedom of \"self-determination\" regarding one's \"decisions or plans.\" Natural freedom is \"(i) inherent in all men, (ii) \"regardless\" of the circumstances under which they live and (iii) \"without regard\" to any state of mind or character which they may or may not acquire in the course of their lives\"\n\nBiblical scholars find that the Bible views all humanity as possessing the \"natural freedom\" of the will that enables \"self-determination.\" \"In this sense of the term\", biblical scholars say that, although the Bible does not use the term, it assumes human \"free will.\" For example, what Adler calls \"natural freedom\" matches the definition of the biblical concept of \"free will\" in the \"Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms\", namely, \"the free choice of the will that all persons possess.\" Other scholars describe free will in the Bible as follows:\n\nThe proper interpretation of biblical passages relating to the freedom of the human will has been the subject of debate for most of the Christian era. The Pelagius versus Augustine of Hippo debate over free will took place in the 5th century. The Erasmus versus Martin Luther arguments in 16th century included disagreements about free will, as did the Arminians versus Calvinists debates in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\nThere is still no resolution of the free will debate because as Robert Kane observes, \"debates about free will are more alive than ever today.\"\n\n\"Acquired freedom,\" in Adler's terminology, is the freedom \"to live as [one] ought to live,\" and to live as one ought requires \"a change or development\" whereby a person acquires \"a state of mind, or character, or personality\" that can be described by such qualities as \"good, wise, virtuous, righteous, holy, healthy, sound, flexible, etc.\"\n\nThus, while Adler ascribes the \"natural freedom\" of \"self-determination\" to everyone, he asserts that the freedom \"to live as [one] ought to live\" must be acquired by \"a change or development\" in a person. The \"New Bible Dictionary\" finds these two distinct freedoms in the Bible:\n\nThe Bible gives a basic reason why a person must acquire a freedom \"to live as [one] ought to live\" when it applies Adam and Eve's sin to all humanity: \"the Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually\" (Genesis 6:5). Or, in Paul's view, \"by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners\" (Romans 5:19). Thus, the Bible describes humanity as connaturally \"enslaved to sin\" (Romans 6:6; John 8:34). Therefore, in biblical thinking, a freedom from being \"enslaved to sin\" in order to \"live as one ought\" must be acquired because \"sin\" is \"the failure to live up to Jesus' commandments to love God and love neighbor.\"\n\nJesus told his hearers that they needed to be \"made\" free: \"if you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free\" (John 8:32). But Jesus' hearers did not understand that he was not talking about freedom from \"economic or social slavery,\" so they responded, \"we are descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone. What do you mean by saying, ‘You will be made free'?\" (John 8:33).\"\n\nTo clarify what he meant by being \"made free,\" Jesus answered them, \"very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin\" (John 8:34). By his words being \"made free,\" Jesus meant being \"made free\" from \"bondage to sin.\" Continuing his reply, Jesus added, \"if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed\" (John 8:36). \"Free indeed [\"ontós\"]\" can be more literally translated \"truly free\" or \"really free,\" as it is in the following translations.\n\nIn the John 8:32–36 passage, Jesus taught that \"those who sin are slaves to their sin whether they realize it or not\" and \"they cannot break away from their sin.\" The freedom of being \"truly free\" or \"really free\" had to be acquired by being \"made\" free by \"the truth,\" John's name for Jesus in 14:6. Thus, Jesus characterized being made \"truly free\" as freedom \"from\" being a \"slave to sin.\" At the same time, the Bible holds that it is freedom \"for\" righteous living because \"from the very beginning God's people were taught that the alternative to servitude was not freedom in some abstract sense, but rather \"freedom to serve the Lord\".\"\n\nWhen the \"New Bible Dictionary\" says of humanity's connatural condition that \"all his voluntary choices are in one way or another acts of serving sin,\" it references Romans 6:17–22. In this passage, Paul depicts the connatural human condition as being \"slaves of sin.\" To be \"set free from sin,\" Paul told his readers that they must \"become slaves of righteousness.\"\n\nRegarding the transformation from being \"slaves of sin\" to being \"slaves of righteousness,\" Douglas J. Moo comments that Paul uses the image of slavery to say that \"being bound to God and his will enables the person to become ‘free'\" – in the sense of being free \"to be what God wants that person to be.\" The slavery image underscores, as Moo says, that what Paul has in mind \"is not freedom to do what one wants, but freedom to obey God\" and that the obedience is done \"willingly, joyfully, naturally,\" and not by coercion as with literal slaves.\n\nThe Fall (sometimes lowercase) in its theological use refers to \"the lapse of human beings into a state of natural or innate sinfulness through the sin of Adam and Eve.\" The story of the Fall is narrated in Genesis 3:1–7.\n\n\"Nelson's Student Bible Dictionary\" describes \"the fall\" as \"the disobedience and sin of Adam and Eve that caused them to lose the state of innocence in which they had been created. This event plunged them and all mankind into a state of sin and corruption.\" \"A Concise Dictionary of Theology\" provides a similar description of the Fall. In their fall, Adam and Eve \"disobeyed God and so lost their innocent, ideal existence\" and \"brought moral evil into the world.\"\n\nThe Bible testifies to the deleterious impact of the Fall on all humanity. Shortly after the Fall, \"the Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually\" (Genesis 6:5). Or, in Paul's view, \"sin came into the world through one man,\" and \"by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners\" (Romans 5:12, 19).\n\nWriting about God's creation and Adam and Eve, \"Baker's Dictionary of Biblical Theology\" says that \"creation is climaxed by persons who possess wills that can choose to either obey or disobey.\" The Book of Ecclesiasticus, which pre-Protestant Reformation churches consider part of the Bible but which Protestants classify among the Apocrypha, explicitly names freedom of the will as an element in God's creation: God \"created humankind in the beginning, and he left them in the power of their own free choice\" (Ecclesiasticus 15:14).\n\nAdam and Eve were created with \"free will,\" that is, \"the ability to choose either good or evil.\" The Fall evidences that Adam and Eve were not created with the freedom that Paul calls being \"slaves of righteousness\" (Romans 6:18): a phrase that denotes \"freedom to obey God – willingly, joyfully, naturally.\"\n\nCritics of the free will theodicy believe that it \"fails\" because \"God could have created free agents without risking bringing moral evil into the world. There is nothing logically inconsistent about a free agent that always chooses the good.\"\nRelating God's creation of Adam and Eve and the Fall to theodicy, J. L. Mackie argues \"there was open to [God] the obviously better possibility of making beings who would freely act but always do right.\" And, Mackie adds, \"clearly, [God's] failure to avail himself of this possibility is inconsistent with his being both omnipotent and wholly good.\"\n\nThe free will theodicy justifies God by ascribing all evil to \"the evil acts of human free will.\" At the same time, the Bible teaches that God \"rules the hearts and actions of all men.\" The Bible contains many portrayals of God as ruling \"hearts and actions\" for evil. Following are a few examples:\n\nThe existence of evil in the world, in the view of Raymond Lam, \"presents the gravest challenge to the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God.\" Lam also observes that \"no theodicy is easy.\"\n\nThe \"Dictionary of Theology\" explains why Lam asserts that \"no theodicy is easy.\" It explains that \"the [theodic] issue is raised in light of the sovereignty of God,\" and it asks, \"how could a holy and loving God who is in control of all things allow evil to exist?\" The difficulty of the question is attested by the fact that \"the answer has been debated for as long as the church has existed,\" but \"we still do not have a definitive answer and the Bible does not seek to justify God's actions.\"\n\nRegarding theodicy and the Bible, \"Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology\" concludes that \"the Bible does not answer the oft-posed problem of how a just, omnipotent, and loving God could permit evil to exist in a universe he had created.\"\n\nWith no \"definitive answer\" to the theodic question, \"debates about theodicy continue among believers and unbelievers alike,\" observes Robert F. Brown. Therefore, Brown adds, \"theodicy remains a perennial concern for thoughtful religious commitment.\" Theodicy remains a \"perennial concern\" because, Brown reports, \"how the divine can be compatible with the existence of evil in the world has perplexed profound thinkers and ordinary people right down to the present day.\"\n\n"}

(Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants of Hungary, Moravia, et al.) is one of the many works by an Abbot monk named Antoine Augustin Calmet, an exegete and an 18th century Lorraine scholar of the Benedictine Order; also known as Dom Calmet. The work was published in 2 volumes that dealt with the extensive investigation into occult matters regarding the apparitions of angels, demons and other spirits but also included dissertations on various topics of Magic, sorcery, witchcraft and instances of vampires, revenants and individuals returning from the grave. This study analyzed accounts of these various topics located in the Bible, mythology, cultural legends and famous accounts of historically documented cases or claims.\n\nThe work was first published in 1746 under the title \"Dissertations sur les apparitions des anges, des démons et des esprits, et sur les revenants et vampires de Hongrie, de Bohême, de Moravie et de Silésie\" after a great deal of praise and response from his readers, the work was expanded and published with Privilege of the King of France in 1751 under the new title \"Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &c.\" and included letters and dissertations by some of his readers and extra chapters as a response to refutations and various claims.\n\n\nThe total work consists of 115 chapters contained in two volumes. The dissertation itself is divided into four parts: In the first, Calmet speaks of good angels; in the second, of the appearance of bad angels; in the third, of the apparitions of souls of the dead; and in the fourth, of the appearance of living men to others living, absent, distant, and this unknown to those who appear; occasionally adding research on magic, wizards, and witches; on the Sabbath, oracles, and the obsession and possession by demons throughout the volumes. He used a scientific approach when looking into pre-modern cases of witchcraft, vampires, superstitious beliefs and various other topics of the occult. He delved into the use of the scientific method, biology, psychology, chemistry, etymology and investigated the history of various legends of folklore to determine whether a claim of hauntings, apparitions or magic were truth or fraud.\n\nThe treatise as a whole consists of extensive research across a wide range of topics. The first tome contains 52 chapters and mostly deals with the apparitions of spirits, angels and demons while also covering the study of magic, sorcery and witchcraft. Topics also include:\n\n\nThe second tome consists of 63 chapters and includes a series of letters thereafter. The study includes:\n\n\nIncluded in the printing of the second tome were many letters. Some were of approbation but also contained in this collection was a letter written by Marquis of Maffei that was of itself a selected dissertation on magical studies that was written in 16 chapters.\n\nCalmet, doubtful of the circumstances involved in the Loudun Possessions, made a detailed comparison to other cases he believed was more true to the principle symptoms of demonic possession. \n\nCalmet researched a judicial case that described the possession of Mademoiselle Elizabeth de Ranfaing, who having become a widow in 1617, was later sought in marriage by a physician (afterwards burned under judicial sentence for being a practicing magician). After being rejected, he gave her philters to make her love him which occasioned strange developments in her health and proceeded to continuously give her some other forms of medicament. The maladies which she suffered were incurable by the various physicians that attended her and eventually led to a recourse of exorcisms as prescribed by several physicians that examined her case. They began to exorcise her in September, 1619. During the exorcisms, the demon that possessed her made detailed and fluid responses in varying languages including French, Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Italian and was reportedly able to know and recite the thoughts and sins of various individuals who examined her. She was further also able to describe in detail with the use of various languages the rites and secrets of the church to experts in the languages she spoke. There was even a mention of how the demon interrupted an exorcist, who after making a mistake in his recital of an exorcism rite in Latin, corrected his speech and mocked him.\n\nCalmet describes the vampire as a \"revenant corpse\" thus distinguishing the intangible ghosts such as phantoms or spirits. He conducted a synthesis of studies on the subject and considers that vampirism is the result of undernourished Balkan. As Calmet amassed numerous reports on events of vampires, his attempt to refute false claims of vampirism proved difficult:\n\n\"[T]hey see, it is said, men who have been dead for several months, come back to earth, talk, walk, infest villages, ill use both men and beasts, suck the blood of their near relations, make them ill, and finally cause their death; so that people can only save themselves from their dangerous visits and their hauntings by exhuming them, impaling them, cutting off their heads, tearing out the heart, or burning them. These revenants are called by the name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, leeches; and such particulars are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these revenants come out of their tombs and produce those effects which are proclaimed of them.\"\n\nCalmet anazlyzed many famous cases including Arnold Paole. Calmet also investigated the Lettres juives in which an account of a vampire had been recorded in 1732 Hungary, witnessed by officers of the tribunal of Belgrade and an officer to the emperor's troops at Graditz. Although the letters were published as an epistolary novel, it was widely believed to be accurate and true records by the populace at the time. \n\nAlso investigated were various judicial cases of dead persons reported to return from the grave attack and suck the blood of the living. One such case was in 1730 of a soldier lodged at the house of a peasant in Hungary. As the soldier sat with the homeowner and the rest of the company at the table for dinner, a person he did not know come into the home and quietly sat at the table with them. The homeowner appeared frightened and was discovered deceased the next day. After inquiry, the soldier learned that the father of the homeowner had died and was buried 10 years before and the family believed the man who came the previous night was the father's body. The soldier informed the regiment, giving notice to the general officers who commissioned the captain of the infantry to further investigate. The captain, accompanied by other officers, a surgeon and an auditor had recorded dispositions of the family who confirmed the soldier's report and also received dispositions of all the residents of the village. The corpse of father was ordered to be exhumed and was found to be in the likeness of a man recently deceased but with the blood-flow of a living man. The Count de Cabreras ordered the corpse's head to be cut off and to be re-entered in his tomb. The count also received other information of another man dead for more than thirty years that was reported by family to have come back to his house on three separate occasions during meal time. On the first he had sucked the blood from the neck of his brother, the second time from one of his sons, and the third from one of the servants in the house; all three of which had died immediately after. Upon this disposition, the commissary took the suspected corpse from the grave finding it to be like the first corpse discovered with a living blood-flow and he ordered them to run a large nail through the temple then placed back into the grave.\n\nCalmet's treatise was awarded numerous approbations and letters of criticism following his first publication in 1746, many of which were included in its republication and expanded 1751 version that included new chapters to answer his audience.\n\nThe treatise received 'Approbation of the King' to the 7th Register on the registry of The Chamber of Royal Booksellers and Printers to Paris on June 9, 1751.\n\nHe is mentioned by Voltaire who in his \"Dictionnaire philosophique\" explains:\n\nCalmet became their historian, and treated vampires as he treated the Old and New Testament, reporting faithfully all that had been said before him\n\nCalmet analyzed a report that was written from a priest who learned information of a town being tormented by a vampiric entity 3 years earlier. After having traveled to the town to investigate and collect information of the various inhabitants there, the priest learned that a vampire had tormented many of the inhabitants at night by coming out from the nearby cemetery to haunt many of the residents at their beds. An unknown Hungarian traveler came to the town during this time and helped the town by setting a trap at the cemetery which ultimately led to the decapitation of the vampire that resided there and curing the town of their torment. This story was retold by Sheridan Le Fanu and adapted into the thirteenth chapter of the novella \"Carmilla\", a work that heavily inspired Bram Stoker's classic Dracula.\n\n\n"}

The sutra was authored by the Hindu sage Kanada, also known as Kashyapa. According to some scholars, he flourished before the advent of Buddhism because the \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" makes no mention of Buddhism or Buddhist doctrines; however, the details of Kanada's life are uncertain, and the \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" was likely compiled sometime between 6th and 2nd century BCE, and finalized in the currently existing version before the start of the common era.\n\nA number of scholars have commented on it since the beginning of common era; the earliest commentary known is the \"Padartha Dharma Sangraha\" of Prashastapada. Another important secondary work on \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" is Maticandra's \"Dasha padartha sastra\" which exists both in Sanskrit and its Chinese translation in 648 CE by Yuanzhuang.\n\nThe \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" is written in aphoristic sutras style, and presents its theories on the creation and existence of the universe using naturalistic atomism, applying logic and realism, and is one of the earliest known systematic realist ontology in human history. The text discusses the meaning of dharma, the importance of the Vedas, a theory of epistemology, the basis of Atman (self, soul), and the nature of yoga and moksha.\n\nThe name \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक सूत्र) is derived from \"Viśeṣa\", which many medieval era scholars such as Gunaratna and modern scholars such as Karl Potter translate as \"ultimate particularity\". However, other scholars such as Udayana and Wilhelm Halbfass state that the contextual root \"Viśeṣa\" in this school refers to \"pluralism and particularity, or more specifically to demarcation, characterization and differentiation\".\n\nTill the 1950s, only one manuscript of \"Vaiseshika sutra\" was known and this manuscript was part of a bhasya by the 15th century Sankaramisra. Scholars had doubted its authenticity, given the inconsistencies in this manuscript and the quotes in other Hindu, Jaina and Buddhist literature claiming to be from the \"Vaisheshika Sutra\". In the 1950s and early 1960s, new manuscripts of \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" were discovered in distant parts of India, which were later identified as this Sutra. These newer manuscripts are quite different, more consistent with the historical literature, and suggests that, like other major texts and scriptures of Hinduism, \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" too suffered interpolations, errors in transmission and distortion over time. A critical edition of the \"Vaiśeṣika Sūtra\" is now available.\n\nThe \"Vaisheshika Sutras\" mention the doctrines of competing schools of Indian philosophy such as Samkhya and Mimamsa, but make no mention of Buddhism, which has led scholars in more recent publications to posit estimates of 6th to 2nd century BCE.\n\nThe critical edition studies of \"Vaisheshika Sutras\" manuscripts discovered after 1950, suggest that the text attributed to Kanada existed in a finalized form sometime between 200 BCE and the start of the common era, with the possibility that its key doctrines are much older. Multiple Hindu texts dated to the 1st and 2nd century CE, such as the \"Mahavibhasa\" and \"Jnanaprasthana\" from the Kushan Empire, quote and comment on Kanada's doctrines. Although the \"Vaisheshika Sutras\" makes no mention of the doctrines of Jainism and Buddhism, their ancient texts mention \"Vaisheshika Sutras\" doctrines and use its terminology, particularly Buddhism's Sarvastivada tradition, as well as the works of Nagarjuna.\n\nThe philosophy in \"Vaiseshika sutra\" is atomistic pluralism, states Jayatilleke. Its ideas are known for its contributions to \"inductive inference\", and often coupled with the \"deductive logic\" of the sister school of Hinduism called the Nyaya. James Thrower and others call Vaiśeṣika philosophy to be naturalism, one that rejects the supernatural.\n\nThe text states:\nSeveral traits of substances (dravya) are given as colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, the separate, coupling and uncoupling, priority and posterity, comprehension, pleasure and pain, attraction and revulsion, and wishes. Like many foundational texts of classical schools of Hindu philosophy, God is not mentioned in the sutra, and the text is non-theistic.\n\nThe critical edition of the \"Vaisheshika Sutras\" are divided into ten chapters, each subdivided into two sections called āhnikas:\n\n\n"}

The Vedangas were sciences that focused on helping understand and interpret the Vedas that had been composed many centuries earlier.\n\nVedangas developed as ancillary studies for the Vedas, but its insights into meters, structure of sound and language, grammar, linguistic analysis and other subjects influenced post-Vedic studies, arts, culture and various schools of Hindu philosophy.

During World War II, he served in military intelligence. He then taught at the University of Iowa (1938–1946), the University of Minnesota (1947–1958), Yale University (1958–1963), and from 1963 until his death, at the University of Pittsburgh. He served as president of the Metaphysical Society of America in 1977. He was a founder of the journal \"Philosophical Studies\".\n\nSellars is well known as a critic of foundationalist epistemology—the \"Myth of the Given\" as he called it. However, his philosophical works are more generally directed toward the ultimate goal of reconciling intuitive ways of describing the world (both those of common sense and traditional philosophy) with a thoroughly naturalist, scientific account of reality. He is widely regarded both for great sophistication of argument and for his assimilation of many and diverse subjects in pursuit of a synoptic vision. Sellars was perhaps the first philosopher to synthesize elements of American pragmatism with elements of British and American analytic philosophy and Austrian and German logical positivism. His work also reflects a sustained engagement with the German tradition of transcendental idealism, most obviously in his book \"Science and Metaphysics: Kantian Variations\".\n\nSellars coined certain now-common idioms in philosophy, such as the \"space of reasons\". This idiom refers to two things. It:\nNote: (2) corresponds in part to the distinction Sellars makes between the manifest image and the scientific image.\n\nSellars' most famous work is the lengthy and difficult paper, \"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\" (1956). In it, he criticises the view that knowledge of what we perceive can be independent of the conceptual processes which result in perception. He named this \"The Myth of the Given,\" attributing it to phenomenology and sense-data theories of knowledge.\n\nThe work targets several theories at once, especially C. I. Lewis' Kantian pragmatism and Rudolf Carnap's positivism. He draws out \"The Myth of Jones,\" to defend the possibility of a strict behaviorist worldview. The parable explains how thoughts, intelligent action, and even subjective inner experience can be attributed to people within a scientific model. Sellars used a fictional tribe, \"Ryleans,\" since he wanted to address Gilbert Ryle's \"The Concept of Mind\".\n\nSellar's idea of \"myth,\" heavily influenced by Ernst Cassirer, is not necessarily negative. He saw it as something that can be useful or otherwise, rather than true or false. He aimed to unite the conceptual behavior of the \"space of reasons\" with the concept of a subjective sense experience. This was one of his most central goals, which his later work described as Kantian.\n\nIn his paper, \"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\" (1961), Sellars introduces the concept of Kantian empiricism. Kantian empiricism features a distinction between (1) claims whose revision requires abandonment or modification of the system of concepts in terms of which they are framed (i.e., modification of the fallible set of constitutive principles underlying knowledge, otherwise known as framework-relative \"a priori\" truths) and (2) claims revisable on the basis of observations formulated in terms of a system of concepts which remained fixed throughout.\n\nIn his \"Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man\" (1962), Sellars distinguishes between the \"manifest image\" and the \"scientific image\" of the world.\n\nThe manifest image includes intentions, thoughts, and appearances. Sellars allows that the manifest image may be refined through 'correlational induction', but he rules out appeal to imperceptible entities.\n\nThe scientific image describes the world in terms of the theoretical physical sciences. It includes notions such as causality and theories about particles and forces.\n\nThe two images sometimes complement one another, and sometimes conflict. For example, the manifest image includes practical or moral claims, whereas the scientific image does not. There is conflict, e.g. where science tells us that apparently solid objects are mostly empty space. Sellars favours a synoptic vision, wherein the scientific image takes ultimate precedence in cases of conflict, at least with respect to empirical descriptions and explanations.\n\nAs a student at the University of Michigan, Wilfrid Sellars was one of the founding members of the first North-American cooperative house for university students, which was then called \"Michigan Socialist House\" (and which was later renamed \"Michigan Cooperative House\").\n\nRobert Brandom, his junior colleague at Pittsburgh, named Sellars and Willard Van Orman Quine as the two most profound and important philosophers of their generation. Sellars' goal of a synoptic philosophy that unites the everyday and scientific views of reality is the foundation and archetype of what is sometimes called the Pittsburgh School, whose members include Brandom, John McDowell, and John Haugeland.\n\nOther philosophers strongly influenced by Sellars span the full spectrum of contemporary English-speaking philosophy, from neopragmatism (Richard Rorty) to eliminative materialism (Paul Churchland) to rationalism (Laurence BonJour). Sellars' philosophical heirs also include Ruth Millikan, Hector-Neri Castaneda, Bruce Aune, Jay Rosenberg, Johanna Seibt, Matthew Burstein, Ray Brassier, Andrew Chrucky, Jeffrey Sicha, Pedro Amaral, Thomas Vinci, Willem A. de Vries, David Rosenthal, Ken Wilber and Michael Williams. Sellar's work has been drawn upon in feminist standpoint theory, for example in the work of Rebecca Kukla.\n\nSellars' death in 1989 was the result of long-term alcoholism. A collection of essays devoted to 'Sellars and his Legacy' was published by Oxford University Press in 2016 (ed., James O'Shea), with contributions from Brandom, deVries, Kraut, Kukla, Lance, McDowell, Millikan, O'Shea, Rosenthal, Seibt, and Williams.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His adoptive parents were followers of the teachings of Swedish philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg. Chidley attended several different schools in Melbourne, leaving school at the age of 13 and continuing his education by reading in public libraries.\n\nChidley was apprenticed first to a solicitor and then to an architect, unsuccessfully. He began working for his adoptive father where he learned photography and developed a talent for drawing. As a younger man, Chidley supported himself by drawing for medical texts. This exposed him to various contemporary medical theories about human sexuality and Chidley formed the conviction that \"there was something profoundly wrong with the way in which modern people had sex\". He believed he had made an important scientific discovery that the human race had been living in error.\n\nIn 1911, Chidley published \"The Answer\" in Melbourne. The authorities attempted to prevent distribution by prosecuting booksellers and Chidley on the grounds that the pamphlet contained material \"which would tend to deprave and corrupt the morals of any person reading it.\" Chidley sold copies to curious passers-by on the footpath. In 1912, Chidley moved to Sydney where he became a familiar bearded figure dressed in a Grecian-style tunic and sandals, giving public lectures and wandering the streets, carrying a bundle of his pamphlets. He preached the \"Answer\" to living a natural life to Sydneysiders. \"Do nothing which is unnatural however slight\" was his precept. He believed people should return to nudity, natural coition and a diet comprising only fruit and nuts to \"be at one with Nature and one another\". Chidley suffered constant persecution by the authorities, was committed to various asylums and even jailed. Regarded as a pervert, because he dared to mention sex in a repressed society, he was on the contrary something of a puritan in his teachings and lifestyle. In 1912 the courts imposed fines on booksellers who stocked \"The Answer\", and in 1914 the Supreme Court suppressed the publication.\n\nChidley was charged with offensive behaviour, deemed insane by the Lunacy Court on 3 August 1912 and sent to the Callan Park Hospital. His case sparked a lot of public debate about the use of the law to imprison people in asylums and he won a lot of public support, people regarding him as a well meaning eccentric or crank deprived of his liberty and his right to speak freely. In August 1916 Chidley was released from an asylum under conditions that he \"not address persons, and particularly women, by circular asking them to grant him interviews, in order that he might explain his theory to them.\" He was banned from holding meetings in public parks but he was soon addressing Sydney crowds in The Domain. On 16 February 1916 Chidley was again found insane and committed to Kenmore Mental Hospital at Goulburn.\n\nChidley wrote his autobiography, entitled \"Confessions\" and sent a copy of the manuscript to Henry Havelock Ellis in 1935 Ellis sent this manuscript to the Mitchell Library, Sydney, remarking \"Not only is it a document of much psychological interest, but as a picture of the intimate aspects of Australian life in the nineteenth century it is of the highest interest, and that value will go on increasing as time passes\".\n\nChidley attempted suicide on 12 October 1916 and later died suddenly on 21 December 1916 of arteriosclerosis, an inmate at Callan Park Hospital for the Insane.\n\n"}

Yoga-darsana is based on the exposition of the epistemological, metaphysical, and methodological ideas of an age-long meditative tradition codified in the work of Patanjali and widely known as Yoga Sutras. \n\nYoga-darsana is concerned primarily with acquisition and perpetuation of two states of mind referred to as \"collocative\" (\"sapaksa\") with Yoga, namely, the state of the onepointed mind (\"ekāgratā\") and the state of the inhibited mental functions (\"niruddha\"). The Yoga itself is being equated with samādhi.\n\n"}
