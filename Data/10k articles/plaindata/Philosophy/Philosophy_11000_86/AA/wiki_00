{"id": "301496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301496", "title": "Advaita Vedanta", "text": "Advaita Vedanta\n\nAdvaita Vedanta (; , IAST: ', literally, \"not-two\"), originally known as Puruṣavāda\"', is a school of Hindu philosophy and religious practice, and one of the classic Indian paths to spiritual realization. The term \"Advaita\" refers to its idea that the soul (true Self, Atman) is the same as the highest metaphysical Reality (Brahman). The followers of this school are known as \"Advaita Vedantins\", or just \"Advaitins\", and they seek spiritual liberation through acquiring \"vidyā\", meaning knowledge, of one's true identity as \"Atman\", and the identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta traces its roots in the oldest Upanishads. It relies on three textual sources called the Prasthanatrayi. It gives \"a unifying interpretation of the whole body of Upanishads\", the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. Advaita Vedanta is the oldest extant sub-school of Vedanta, which is one of the six orthodox (\"āstika\") Hindu philosophies (). Although its roots trace back to the 1st millennium BCE, the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Vedanta is considered by the tradition to be 8th century scholar Adi Shankara.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta emphasizes \"Jivanmukti\", the idea that \"moksha\" (freedom, liberation) is achievable in this life in contrast to Indian philosophies that emphasize \"videhamukti\", or \"moksha\" after death. The school uses concepts such as Brahman, Atman, Maya, Avidya, meditation and others that are found in major Indian religious traditions, but interprets them in its own way for its theories of moksha. Advaita Vedanta is one of the most studied and most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Many scholars describe it as a form of monism, others describe the \"Advaita\" philosophy as non-dualistic.\n\nAdvaita influenced and was influenced by various traditions and texts of Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, other sub-schools of Vedanta, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, the Puranas, the Agamas, as well as social movements such as the Bhakti movement. Beyond Hinduism, Advaita Vedanta interacted and developed with the other traditions of India such as Jainism and Buddhism. Advaita Vedanta texts espouse a spectrum of views from idealism, including illusionism, to realist or nearly realist positions expressed in the early works of Shankara. In modern times, its views appear in various Neo-Vedanta movements. It has been termed as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta school has been historically referred to by various names, such as \"Advaita-vada\" (speaker of Advaita), \"Abheda-darshana\" (view of non-difference), \"Dvaita-vada-pratisedha\" (denial of dual distinctions), and \"Kevala-dvaita\" (non-dualism of the isolated).\n\nAccording to Richard King, a professor of Buddhist and Asian studies, the term \"Advaita\" first occurs in a recognizably Vedantic context in the prose of Mandukya Upanishad. In contrast, according to Frits Staal, a professor of Philosophy specializing in Sanskrit and Vedic studies, the word \"Advaita\" is from the Vedic era, and the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya (8th or 7th-century BCE) is credited to be the one who coined it. Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, translates the \"Advaita\" containing verse excerpt in \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", as follows:\nAdvaita is a subschool of Vedanta, the latter being one of the six classical Hindu \"darśanas\". It, like nearly all these philosophies, has an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices for what Hinduism considers four proper aims of life: virtue (\"dharma\"), material prosperity (\"artha\"), desire (\"kama\") and the fourth and final aim being \"moksha\", the spiritual liberation or release from cycles of rebirth (samsara). Traditional Advaita Vedanta centers on the study of the \"sruti\" especially the Principal Upanishads, along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nWithin the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism are many sub-schools, of which Advaita is one. Unlike Buddhism, but like Jainism, all Vedanta schools consider the existence of Atman (real self, soul) as self-evident. The Vedanta tradition also posits the concept of Brahman as the eternal, unchanging metaphysical reality. The sub-schools of Vedanta disagree on the relation between \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\". The Advaita \"darsana\" considers them to be identical.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta believes that the knowledge of one's true self or Atman is liberating. Along with self-knowledge, it teaches that \"moksha\" can be achieved by the correct understanding of one's true identity as Ātman, the dispassionate and unmoveable observer, and the identity of Ātman and Brahman.\n\nThe process of acquiring this knowledge entails realising that one’s True Self, the Atman, is essentially the same as Brahman. This is achieved through what Sankara refers to as \"anubhava\", immediate intuition. Sankara contends that this direct awareness is construction-free, and not construction-filled. Self-knowledge is, therefore, not seen as an awareness \"of Brahman\", but instead an awareness that \"is Brahman\", since one will transcend any form of duality in this state of consciousness.\n\nCorrect knowledge, which destroys \"avidya\", psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, is obtained through three stages of practice, \"sravana\" (hearing), \"manana\" (thinking) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation).\n\nThe Vedanta tradition of Hinduism rejects the dualism of Samkhya. The Samkhya school of Hindu thought proposes two metaphysical realities, namely Purusha (spirit) and Prakriti (inert primal matter), then states that Purusha is the efficient cause of all existence while Prakriti is its material cause. Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman is both the efficient and the material cause, \"that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed.\" What created all existence is also present in and reflected in all beings and inert matter, the creative principle was and is everywhere, always. This Brahman it postulates is \"sat-cit-ananda\" (truth-consciousness-bliss). By accepting this postulation, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedanta traditions offer different answers for: first, how did \"sat\" Brahman without any distinction become manifold universe? second, how did \"cit\" Brahman create material world? third, if \"ananda\" Brahman is pure bliss, why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? These are the questions that Advaita Vedanta thinkers have historically attempted to answer, as did the non-Advaita schools of Hinduism.\n\nAdvaita establishes its truths, in part, from the oldest Principal Upanishads (\"sruti\"), the Brahma Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita and numerous other Hindu texts. Reason is used to support revelation, the \"sruti\", the ultimate source of truth. Reason clarifies the truth and removes objections, according to the Advaita school, however it believes that pure logic cannot lead to philosophical truths and only experience and meditative insights do. The \"Sruti\", it believes is a collection of experience and meditative insights about liberating knowledge. The Advaita literature also provide a criticism of opposing systems, including the dualistic school of Hinduism, as well as non-Hindu philosophies such as Buddhism.\n\nAdvaita, like other schools, accepts Puruṣārtha - the four goals of human life as natural and proper:\n\nOf these, much of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy focuses on the last, gaining liberation in one's current life. The first three are discussed and encouraged by Advaitins, but usually in the context of knowing Brahman and Self-realization.\n\nThe soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of Atman and Brahman. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to liberation, Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life. This is stated by Shankara as follows:\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, liberation can be achieved while living, and is called \"Jivanmukti\". The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self and its relationship to Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought. Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is that state of full awareness, liberation and freedom which overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others and all beings, the non-dual Oneness, that Brahman is in everything, and everything is Brahman.\n\nAccording to Rambachan, in Advaita, this state of liberating self-knowledge includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\"\n\nIn Advaita Vedanta, the interest is not in liberation in after life, but in one's current life. This school holds that liberation can be achieved while living, and a person who achieves this is called a \"Jivanmukta\".\n\nThe concept of \"Jivanmukti\" of Advaita Vedanta contrasts with \"Videhamukti\" (moksha from samsara after death) in theistic sub-schools of Vedanta. Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, after which the liberated individual shows attributes such as:\n\n\"Sruti\" (scriptures), proper reasoning and meditation are the main sources of knowledge (\"vidya\") for the Advaita Vedanta tradition. It teaches that correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is achievable by \"svādhyāya\", study of the self and of the Vedic texts, and three stages of practice: \"sravana\" (perception, hearing), \"manana\" (thinking) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation), a three-step methodology that is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\".\n\n\"Sravana\" literally means hearing, and broadly refers to perception and observations typically aided by a counsellor or teacher (guru), wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers. \"Manana\" refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on \"svadhyaya\" and \"sravana\". \"Nididhyāsana\" refers to meditation, realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state where there is a fusion of thought and action, knowing and being. Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as \"sadhana\" practice that unifies \"Yoga\" and \"Karma\" ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions.\n\nAdi Shankara uses \"anubhava\" interchangeably with \"pratipatta\", \"understanding\". Dalal and others state that \"anubhava\" does not center around some sort of \"mystical experience,\" but around the correct knowledge of Brahman. Nikhalananda states that (knowledge of) \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\" can only be reached by \"buddhi\", \"reason,\" stating that mysticism is a kind of intuitive knowledge, while \"buddhi\" is the highest means of attaining knowledge.\n\nSeveral \"Mahavakyas\", or \"the great sentences\", have Advaitic theme, that is \"the inner immortal self and the great cosmic power are one and the same\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta entails more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature, but also includes self-restraint, textual studies and ethical perfection. It is described in classical Advaita books like Shankara's Upadesasahasri and the Vivekachudamani, which is also attributed to Shankara.\n\nClassical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain moksha. It consists of fourfold qualities, or behavioral qualifications (\"Samanyasa\", \"Sampattis\", \"sādhana-catustaya\"):\n\nCorrect knowledge, which destroys \"avidya\", psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, is obtained in \"jnanayoga\" through three stages of practice, \"sravana\" (hearing), \"manana\" (thinking) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation). This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\":\n\nWhile Shankara emphasized sravana (\"hearing\"), manana (\"reflection\") and nididhyasana (\"repeated meditation\"), later texts like the \"Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka\" (14th century) and \"Vedantasara (of Sadananda)\" (15th century) added samadhi as a means to liberation, a theme that was also emphasized by Swami Vivekananda.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta school has traditionally had a high reverence for Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality. However, the Guru is not mandatory in Advaita school, states Clooney, but reading of Vedic literature and followed by reflection is. Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words \"such as \"Sastracaryopadesa\" (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and \"Vedantacaryopadesa\" (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru\". This reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization.\n\nA guru is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the \"guru\" serving as a \"counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student. The guru, states Joel Mlecko, is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a \"counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.\"\n\nThe classical Advaita Vedanta explains all reality and everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman. To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, and there is no dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman. With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality, the theory of two truths, and by developing and integrating these ideas with its theory of errors (\"anirvacaniya khyati\").\n\nShankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion:\n\nAdvaita Vedanta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions. It states that everything and each reality has multiple perspectives, both absolute and relative. All these are valid and true in their respective contexts, states Advaita, but only from their respective particular perspectives. This \"absolute and relative truths\" explanation, Advaitins call as the \"two truths\" doctrine. John Grimes, a professor of Indian Religions specializing on Vedanta, explains this Advaita doctrine with the example of light and darkness. From sun's perspective, it neither rises nor sets, there is no darkness, and \"all is light\". From the perspective of a person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not \"all is light\", there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. What is true from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another. To Advaita Vedanta, this does not mean there are two truths and two realities, but it only means that the same one Reality and one Truth is explained or experienced from two different perspectives.\n\nAs they developed these theories, Advaita Vedanta scholars were influenced by some ideas from the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy. These theories have not enjoyed universal consensus among Advaitins, and various competing ontological interpretations have flowered within the Advaita tradition.\n\nAdvaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings, and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine:\n\nAdvaita also posits the fourth state of Turiya, which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya is the state of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (\"ananta\") and non-different (\"advaita/abheda\"), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the \"Jivanmukta\".\n\nAdvaita traces the foundation of this ontological theory in more ancient Sanskrit texts. For example, chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the \"four states of consciousness\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep. One of the earliest mentions of \"Turiya\", in the Hindu scriptures, occurs in verse 5.14.3 of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\". The idea is also discussed in other early Upanishads.\n\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the highest Reality, That which is unborn and unchanging, and \"not sublatable\", and cannot be superseded by a still higher reality. Other than \"Brahman\", everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is \"Paramarthika Satyam\", \"Absolute Truth\", and\nIn Advaita, Brahman is the substrate and cause of all changes. Brahman is considered to be the material cause and the efficient cause of all that exists. Brahman is the \"primordial reality that creates, maintains and withdraws within it the universe.\" It is the \"creative principle which lies realized in the whole world\".\n\nAdvaita's Upanishadic roots state Brahman's qualities to be \"Sat-cit-ānanda\" (being-consciousness-bliss) It means \"true being-consciousness-bliss,\" or \"Eternal Bliss Consciousness\". Adi Shankara held that \"satcitananda\" is identical with Brahman and Atman. The Advaitin scholar Madhusudana Sarasvati explained Brahman as the Reality that is simultaneously an absence of falsity (sat), absence of ignorance (cit), and absence of sorrow/self-limitation (ananda). According to Adi Shankara, the knowledge of Brahman that Shruti provides cannot be obtained in any other means besides self inquiry.\n\nĀtman (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is a central idea in Hindu philosophy and a foundational premise of Advaita Vedanta. It is a Sanskrit word that means \"real self\" of the individual, \"essence\", and soul.\n\nĀtman is the first principle in Advaita Vedanta, along with its concept of Brahman, with Atman being the perceptible personal particular and Brahman the inferred unlimited universal, both synonymous and interchangeable. It is, to an Advaitin, the unchanging, enduring, eternal absolute. It is the \"true self\" of an individual, a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware (\"svaprakashata\")\". Atman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual. It asserts that there is \"spirit, soul, self\" (Atman) within each living entity, which are same as each other and identical to the universal eternal Brahman. It is an experience of \"oneness\" which unifies all beings, in which there is the divine in every being, in which all existence is a single Reality, and in which there is no \"divine\" distinct from the individual Atman.\n\nAtman is not the constantly changing body, not the desires, not the emotions, not the ego, nor the dualistic mind in Advaita Vedanta. It is the introspective, inwardly self-conscious \"on-looker\" (\"saksi\"). To Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance, see their \"I-ness\" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.\n\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, Atman is identical to Brahman. This is expressed in the \"mahavakya\" \"tat tvam asi\", \"thou are that.\" There is \"a common ground, viz. consciousness, to the individual and Brahman.\" Each soul, in Advaita view, is non-different from the infinite. According to Shankara, Atman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical.\n\nMoksha is attained by realizing the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life. This is frequently stated by Advaita scholars, such as Shankara, as:\n\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the sole reality. The status of the phenomenal world is an important question in Advaita Vedanta, and different solutions have been proposed. The perception of the phenomenal world as real is explained by \"maya\" (constantly changing reality) and \"avidya\" (\"ignorance\"). Other than \"Brahman\", everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is \"Paramarthika Satyam\", \"Absolute Truth\", and \"the true Self, pure consciousness, the only Reality (\"sat\"), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublatable\".\n\nAll schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of \"Satkāryavāda\", which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The \"Brahma Sutras\", the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, support \"Parinamavada\", the idea that the world is a real transformation (\"parinama\") of Brahman.\n\nScholars disagree on the whether Adi Shankara and his Advaita system explained causality through \"vivarta\". According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of \"parinama-vada\", the competing causality theory is \"Vivartavada\", which says \"the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (\"vivarta\") of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts\". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara. \"Although the world can be described as conventionally real\", adds Nicholson, \"the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman’s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated\".\n\nHowever, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree. Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate \"Vivartavada\", and his explanations are \"remote from any connotation of illusion\". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to \"Vivarta\", and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position. Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the \"vivarta-vada\" isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to \"parinama-vada\", and the \"vivarta\" explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later.\n\nAccording to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta states that from \"the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation\" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification.\n\nThe doctrine of Maya is used to explain the empirical reality in Advaita. Jiva, when conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, states Vedanta school, which leads it to misunderstand Maya and interpret it as the sole and final reality. Advaitins assert that the perceived world, including people and other existence, is not what it appears to be\". It is Māyā, they assert, which manifests and perpetuates a sense of false duality or divisional plurality. The empirical manifestation is real but changing, but it obfuscates the true nature of metaphysical Reality which is never changing. Advaita school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of the unchanging Reality and truths – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).\n\nIn Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical reality) and \"Paramarthika\" (absolute, spiritual Reality). Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self—the Cosmic Spirit also known as Brahman. This theory of māyā was expounded and explained by Adi Shankara. Competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory, and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā. A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, \"Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world.\"\n\nBrahman is the sole metaphysical truth in Advaita Vedanta, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Complete knowledge of true Reality includes knowing both \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical) and \"Paramarthika\" (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the unity and Oneness of all reality.\n\nDue to ignorance (), Brahman is perceived as the material world and its objects (nama rupa vikara). According to Shankara, Brahman is in reality attributeless and formless. Brahman, the highest truth and all (Reality), does not really change; it is only our ignorance that gives the appearance of change. Also due to , the true identity is forgotten, and material reality, which manifests at various levels, is mistaken as the only and true reality.\n\nThe notion of avidyā and its relationship to Brahman creates a crucial philosophical issue within Advaita Vedanta thought: how can avidyā appear in Brahman, since Brahman is pure consciousness? Sengaku Mayeda writes, in his commentary and translation of Adi Shankara's Upadesasahasri:\nTo Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance of this Universal Self, see their \"I-ness\" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.\n\nSubsequent Advaitins gave somewhat various explanations, from which various Advaita schools arose.\n\nThe ancient and medieval texts of Advaita Vedanta and other schools of Hindu philosophy discuss \" Pramana\" (epistemology). The theory of Pramana discusses questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. Advaita Vedānta, accepts the following six kinds of :\n\n\"Pratyakṣa\" (प्रत्यक्षाय), perception, is of two types: external - that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, and internal - perception of inner sense, the mind. Advaita postulates four pre-requisites for correct perception: 1) \"Indriyarthasannikarsa\" (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), 2) \"Avyapadesya\" (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), 3) \"Avyabhicara\" (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and 4) \"Vyavasayatmaka\" (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe). The internal perception concepts included \"pratibha\" (intuition), \"samanyalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and \"jnanalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).\n\n\"Anumāṇa\" (अनुमान), inference, is defined as applying reason to reach a new conclusion about truth from one or more observations and previous understanding of truths. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of \"Anumana\". This epistemological method for gaining knowledge consists of three parts: 1) \"Pratijna\" (hypothesis), 2) \"Hetu\" (a reason), and 3) \"drshtanta\" (examples). The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts: 1) \"Sadhya\" (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and 2) \"Paksha\" (the object on which the \"Sadhya\" is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if \"Sapaksha\" (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if \"Vipaksha\" (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies further demand \"Vyapti\" - the requirement that the \"hetu\" (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in \"all\" cases, in both \"sapaksha\" and \"vipaksha\". A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a \"nigamana\" (conclusion).\n\n\"Upamāṇa\" (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge. \"Upamana\", states Lochtefeld, may be explained with the example of a traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called \"upameyam\", the object of comparison is called \"upamanam\", while the attribute(s) are identified as \"samanya\".\n\n\"Arthāpatti\" (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, derivation from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this \"pramana\" is similar to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this \"Pramana\" as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable.\n\n\"Anupalabdi\" (अनुपलब्धि), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. \"Anupalabdhi pramana\" suggests that knowing a negative, such as \"there is no jug in this room\" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means. In Advaita school of Hindu philosophy, a valid conclusion is either \"sadrupa\" (positive) or \"asadrupa\" (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other \"pramana\", Indian scholars refined \"Anupalabdi\" to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept \"non-perception\" as a \"pramana\". Advaita considers this method as valid and useful when the other five \"pramanas\" fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth. A variation of \"Anupaladbi\", called Abhava (अभाव) has also been posited as an epistemic method. It means non-existence. Some scholars consider \"Anupalabdi\" to be same as \"Abhava\", while others consider \"Anupalabdi\" and \"Abhava\" as different. \"Abhava-pramana\" has been discussed in Advaita in the context of \"Padārtha\" (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A \"Padartha\" is defined as that which is simultaneously \"Astitva\" (existent), \"Jneyatva\" (knowable) and \"Abhidheyatva\" (nameable). \"Abhava\" was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: \"dhvamsa\" (termination of what existed), \"atyanta-abhava\" (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), \"anyonya-abhava\" (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and \"pragavasa\" (prior, antecedent non-existence).\n\n\"Śabda\" (शब्द), relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains \"Sabda-pramana\" as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through \"Sabda\" (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the \"Sabda\" of reliable sources. The disagreement between Advaita and other schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability.\n\nSome claim, states Deutsch, \"that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character\". However, adds Deutsch, ethics \"does\" have a firm place in this philosophy. Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers \"an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary\". According to Advaita Vedanta, states Deutsch, there cannot be \"any absolute moral laws, principles or duties\", instead in its axiological view Atman is \"beyond good and evil\", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of \"distinctionless Oneness\" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman. Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own soul and another being's, good and just Karma.\n\nThe values and ethics in Advaita Vedanta emanate from what it views as inherent in the state of liberating self-knowledge. This state, according to Rambachan, includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\" Such knowledge and understanding of the indivisibility of one's and other's Atman, Advaitins believe leads to \"a deeper identity and affinity with all\". It does not alienate or separate an Advaitin from his or her community, rather awakens \"the truth of life's unity and interrelatedness\". These ideas are exemplified in the Isha Upanishad – a \"sruti\" for Advaita, as follows:\n\nAdi Shankara, a leading proponent of Advaita, in verse 1.25 to 1.26 of his \"Upadeśasāhasrī\", asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by the observation of Yamas (ethical precepts) such as Ahimsa (non-violence, abstinence from injuring others in body, mind and thoughts), Satya (truth, abstinence from falsehood), Asteya (abstinence from theft), Aparigraha (abstinence from possessiveness and craving) and a simple life of meditation and reflection. Rituals and rites can help focus and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge, however, Shankara discourages ritual worship and oblations to \"Deva\" (God), because that assumes the Self within is different than Brahman. The \"doctrine of difference\" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, \"he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman\".\n\nElsewhere, in verses 1.26-1.28, the Advaita text Upadesasahasri states the ethical premise of equality of all beings. Any \"Bheda\" (discrimination), states Shankara, based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge. This text states that the fully liberated person understands and practices the ethics of non-difference.\n\nThe Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, providing the truths about the identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\" and their changeless nature.\n\nAdi Shankara gave a nondualist interpretation of these texts in his commentaries. Adi Shankara's \"Bhashya\" (commentaries) have become central texts in the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, but are one among many ancient and medieval manuscripts available or accepted in this tradition. The subsequent Advaita tradition has further elaborated on these sruti and commentaries.\n\nThe \"Vedanta\" tradition provides exegeses of the \"Upanishads\", the \"Brahma Sutras\", and the \"Bhagavadgita\", collectively called the \"Prasthanatrayi\", literally, \"three sources\".\n\nThe identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\", and their unchanging, eternal nature, are basic truths in Advaita Vedanta. The school considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its \"karma-kanda\" (ritual injunctions). The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman and Brahman are found in the Upanishads, which Advaita Vedanta has regarded as \"errorless revealed truth.\" Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta, like all orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, accepts as an epistemic premise that Śruti (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge. The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts - the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads. Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts in the Advaita school.\n\nThe possibility of different interpretations of the Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars. The Brahmasutra (also called Vedanta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts the need for the Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining pramanas. This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the Brahmasutra as a common reference and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, similarly in parts can be interpreted to be a monist Advaita text, and in other parts as theistic Dvaita text. It too has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta existed prior to Adi Shankara but found in him its most influential expounder.\n\nOf the Vedanta-school before the composition of the Brahma Sutras (400–450 CE), wrote Nakamura in 1950, almost nothing is known. The two Advaita writings of pre-Shankara period, known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th-century, were the \"Vākyapadīya\", written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century), and the \"Māndūkya-kārikā\" written by Gaudapada (7th century CE).\n\nScholarship after 1950 suggests that almost all Sannyasa Upanishads have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook. Six of these Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century.\n\nThe strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient texts may be, states Patrick Olivelle, because major Hindu monasteries of this period (early 1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.\n\nThe Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Vedanta gives an interpretation. The Upanishads do not contain \"a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments\". This philosophical inquiry was performed by the darsanas, the various philosophical schools.\n\nThe Brahma Sutras of Bādarāyana, also called the \"Vedanta Sutra\", were compiled in its present form around 400–450 CE, but \"the great part of the \"Sutra\" must have been in existence much earlier than that\". Estimates of the date of Bādarāyana's lifetime differ between 200 BCE and 200 CE.\n\nThe Brahma Sutra is a critical study of the teachings of the Upanishads. It was and is a guide-book for the great teachers of the Vedantic systems. Bādarāyana was not the first person to systematise the teachings of the Upanishads. He refers to seven Vedantic teachers before him:\nAccording to Nakamura, \"there must have been an enormous number of other writings turned out in this period, but unfortunately all of them have been scattered or lost and have not come down to us today\". In his commentaries, Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya. In the beginning of his commentary on the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad Shankara salutes the teachers of the Brahmavidya Sampradaya. Pre-Shankara doctrines and sayings can be traced in the works of the later schools, which does give insight into the development of early Vedanta philosophy.\n\nThe names of various important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the \"Siddhitraya\" by Yamunācārya (c.1050), the \"Vedārthasamgraha\" by Rāmānuja (c.1050–1157), and the \"Yatīndramatadīpikā\" by Śrīnivāsa-dāsa. Combined together, at least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahman Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.\n\nAlthough Shankara is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Vedanta school, according to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of these early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought \"were advocated by someone before Śankara\". Shankara \"was the person who synthesized the \"Advaita-vāda\" which had previously existed before him\". In this synthesis, he was the rejuvenator and defender of ancient learning. He was an unequalled commentator, due to whose efforts and contributions the Advaita Vedanta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy.\n\nGaudapada (6th century) was the teacher of Govinda Bhagavatpada and the grandteacher of Shankara. Gaudapada uses the concepts of Ajativada and Maya to establish \"that from the level of ultimate truth the world is a cosmic illusion,\" and \"suggests that the whole of our waking experience is exactly the same as an illusory and insubstantial dream.\" In contrast, Adi Shankara insists upon a distinction between waking experience and dreams.\n\nGaudapada wrote or compiled the ', also known as the ' or the '. The ' is a commentary in verse form on the \"Mandukya Upanishad\", one of the shortest Upanishads consisting of just 13 prose sentences. Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedanta, the oldest surviving complete text is the \"Māṇḍukya Kārikā\". Many other texts with same type of teachings and which were older than \"Māṇḍukya Kārikā\" existed and this is unquestionable because other scholars and their views are cited by Gaudapada, Shankara and Anandagiri, according to Hajime Nakamura. Gaudapada relied particularly on \"Mandukya Upanishad\", as well as \"Brihadaranyaka\" and \"Chandogya Upanishads\".\n\nThe \"Mandukya Upanishad\" was considered to be a Śruti before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important. In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy. The entire \"Karika\" became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era.\n\nAround 740 AD Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, also known as . It is located in Kavale, Ponda, Goa, and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins.\n\nAdi Shankara (788–820), also known as and , represents a turning point in the development of Vedanta. After the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedanta, culminating in the works of Gaudapada, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works, synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita. Using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita Vedanta in the 8th century CE, though the school was founded many centuries earlier by Badarayana. His thematic focus extended beyond metaphysics and soteriology, and he laid a strong emphasis on \"Pramanas\", that is epistemology or \"means to gain knowledge, reasoning methods that empower one to gain reliable knowledge\". Rambachan, for example, summarizes the widely held view on one aspect of Shankara's epistemology before critiquing it as follows,\nSengaku Mayeda concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (\"vastutantra\"), and considered subjective opinions (\"purushatantra\") and injunctions in Śruti (\"codanatantra\") as secondary. Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (\"pramana-janya\") in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra-bhasya.\n\nAdi Shankara cautioned against cherrypicking a phrase or verse out of context from Vedic literature, and remarked that the \"Anvaya\" (theme or purport) of any treatise can only be correctly understood if one attends to the \"Samanvayat Tatparya Linga\", that is six characteristics of the text under consideration: \n\nWhile this methodology has roots in the theoretical works of Nyaya school of Hinduism, Shankara consolidated and applied it with his unique exegetical method called \"Anvaya-Vyatireka\", which states that for proper understanding one must \"accept only meanings that are compatible with all characteristics\" and \"exclude meanings that are incompatible with any\".\n\nHacker and Phillips note that this insight into rules of reasoning and hierarchical emphasis on epistemic steps is \"doubtlessly the suggestion\" of Shankara in Brahma-sutra, an insight that flowers in the works of his companion and disciple Padmapada. Merrell-Wolff states that Shankara accepts Vedas and Upanishads as a source of knowledge as he develops his philosophical theses, yet he never rests his case on the ancient texts, rather proves each thesis, point by point using \"pranamas\" (epistemology), reason and experience.\n\nShankara lived in the time of the so-called \"Late classical Hinduism\", which lasted from 650 to 1100CE. This era was one of political instability that followed Gupta dynasty and King Harsha of the 7thcenturyCE. It was a time of social and cultural change as the ideas of Buddhism, Jainism, and various traditions within Hinduism were competing for members. Buddhism in particular influenced India's spiritual traditions in the first 700 years of the 1st millennium CE. Shankara and his contemporaries made a significant contribution in understanding Buddhism and the ancient Vedic traditions; they then transformed the extant ideas, particularly reforming the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism, making it India's most important tradition for more than a thousand years.\n\nAdi Shankara is best known for his systematic reviews and commentaries (\"Bhasyas\") on ancient Indian texts. Shankara's masterpiece of commentary is the \"Brahmasutrabhasya\" (literally, commentary on Brahma Sutra), a fundamental text of the Vedanta school of Hinduism. His commentaries on ten Mukhya (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars. Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita (part of his Prasthana Trayi Bhasya).\n\nShankara's \"Vivarana\" (tertiary notes) on the commentary by Vedavyasa on Yogasutras as well as those on Apastamba Dharma-sũtras (\"Adhyatama-patala-bhasya\") are accepted by scholars as authentic works of Adi Shankara. Among the \"Stotra\" (poetic works), the Daksinamurti Stotra, Bhajagovinda Stotra, Sivanandalahari, Carpata-panjarika, Visnu-satpadi, Harimide, Dasa-shloki, and Krishna-staka are likely to be authentic. He also authored Upadesasahasri, his most important original philosophical work. Of other original \"Prakaranas\" (प्रकरण, monographs, treatise), 76 works are attributed to Adi Shankara. Modern era Indian scholars Belvalkar and Upadhyaya accept five and thirty nine works, respectively, as authentic.\n\nSeveral commentaries on Nrisimha-Purvatatapaniya and Shveshvatara Upanishads have been attributed to Adi Shankara, but their authenticity is highly doubtful. Similarly, commentaries on several early and later Upanishads attributed to Shankara are rejected by scholars as his works, and are likely works of later Advaita Vedanta scholars; these include the Kaushitaki Upanishad, Maitri Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Sakatayana Upanishad, Mandala Brahmana Upanishad, Maha Narayana Upanishad, and Gopalatapaniya Upanishad.\n\nThe authenticity of Shankara being the author of has been questioned, and \"modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara.\" The authorship of Shankara of his Mandukya Upanishad \"Bhasya\" and his supplementary commentary on Gaudapada's \"\" has been disputed by Nakamura. However, other scholars state that the commentary on Mandukya, which is actually a commentary on Madukya-Karikas by Gaudapada, may be authentic.\n\nShankara's status in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta is unparallelled. He travelled all over India to help restore the study of the Vedas. His teachings and tradition form the basis of Smartism and have influenced Sant Mat lineages. He introduced the form of worship, the simultaneous worship of five deitiesGanesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi. Shankara explained that all deities were but different forms of the one Brahman, the invisible Supreme Being.\n\nBenedict Ashley credits Adi Shankara for unifying two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines in Hinduism, namely Atman and Brahman. Isaeva states that Shankara's influence extended to reforming Hinduism, founding monasteries, edifying disciples, disputing opponents, and engaging in philosophic activity that, in the eyes of Indian tradition, helped revive \"the orthodox idea of the unity of all beings\" and Vedanta thought.\n\nSome scholars doubt Shankara's early influence in India. According to King and Roodurmun, until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Mandana-Misra, who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita. Other scholars state that the historical records for this period are unclear, and little reliable information is known about the various contemporaries and disciples of Shankara.\n\nSeveral scholars suggest that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later, particularly during the era of the Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India. Many of Shankara's biographies were created and published in and after the 14th century, such as the widely cited Vidyaranya's Śankara-vijaya. Vidyaranya, also known as Madhava, who was the 12th Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from 1380 to 1386, inspired the re-creation of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India in response to the devastation caused by the Islamic Delhi Sultanate. He and his brothers, suggest Paul Hacker and other scholars, wrote about Śankara as well as extensive Advaitic commentaries on the Vedas and Dharma. Vidyaranya was a minister in the Vijayanagara Empire and enjoyed royal support, and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values, spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara's Vedanta philosophies, and establish monasteries (\"mathas\") to expand the cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta.\n\nSureśvara (fl. 800-900 CE) and Maṇḍana Miśra were contemporaries of Shankara, Sureśvara often (incorrectly) being identified with Maṇḍana Miśra. Both explained Sankara \"on the basis of their personal convictions\". Sureśvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nMaṇḍana Miśra was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the \"Brahma-siddhi\". According to tradition, Maṇḍana Miśra and his wife were defeated by Shankara in a debate, after which he became a follower of Shankara. Yet, his attitude toward Shankara was that of a \"self-confident rival teacher of Advaita\", and his influence was such that some regard the \"Brahma-siddhi\" to have \"set forth a non-Shankaran brand of Advaita\"\" The \"theory of error\" set forth in this work became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error. It was Vachaspati Misra's commentary on this work that linked it to Shankara's teaching. His influential thesis in the Advaita tradition has been that errors are opportunities because they \"lead to truth\", and full correct knowledge requires that not only should one understand the truth but also examine and understand errors as well as what is not truth.\n\nHiriyanna and Kuppuswami Sastra have pointed out that Sureśvara and Maṇḍana Miśra had different views on various doctrinal points:\n\nAfter Shankara's death, several sub-schools developed. Two of them still exist today, the Bhāmatī and the Vivarana. Two defunct schools are the \"Pancapadika\" and \"Istasiddhi\", which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.\n\nThese schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines. Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of māyā and avidya.\n\nPadmapada (c. 800 CE) was a direct disciple of Shankara who wrote the \"Pancapadika\", a commentary on the \"Sankara-bhaya\". Padmapada diverged from Shankara in his description of \"avidya\", designating \"prakrti\" as \"avidya\" or \"ajnana\".\n\nVachaspati Misra (800–900 CE) wrote the \"Brahmatattva-samiksa\", a commentary on Maṇḍana Miśra's \"Brahma-siddhi\", which provides the link between Mandana Misra and Shankara and attempts to harmonise Shankara's thought with that of Mandana Misra. According to Advaita tradition, Shankara reincarnated as Vachaspati Misra \"to popularise the Advaita System through his Bhamati\". Only two works are known of Vachaspati Misra, the \"Brahmatattva-samiksa\" on Maṇḍana Miśra's \"Brahma-siddhi\", and his \"Bhamati\" on the \"Sankara-bhasya\", Shankara's commentary on the Brahma-sutras. The name of the Bhamati sub-school is derived from this \"Bhamati\".\n\nThe Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the Jiva as the source of avidya. It sees meditation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors.\n\nPrakasatman (c. 1200–1300) wrote the \"Pancapadika-Vivarana\", a commentary on the \"Pancapadika\" by Padmapadacharya. The \"Vivarana\" lends its name to the subsequent school. According to Roodurmum, \"[H]is line of thought [...] became the leitmotif of all subsequent developments in the evolution of the Advaita tradition.\"\n\nThe Vivarana school takes an epistemological approach. Prakasatman was the first to propound the theory of \"mulavidya\" or \"maya\" as being of \"positive beginningless nature\", and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. Another problem is that contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman.\n\nVimuktatman (c. 1200 CE) wrote the \"Ista-siddhi\". It is one of the four traditional \"siddhi\", together with Mandana's \"Brahma-siddhi\", Suresvara's \"Naiskarmya-siddhi\", and Madusudana's \"Advaita-siddhi\". According to Vimuktatman, absolute Reality is \"pure intuitive consciousness\". His school of thought was eventually replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.\n\nMichael s. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studies, but \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedanta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\"\n\nAccording to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in the later Advaita tradition are:\n\nWhile Indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara's system as the measure for an \"orthodox\" Advaita Vedanta, the living Advaita Vedanta tradition in medieaval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the \"Yoga Vasistha\" and the \"Bhagavata Purana\". The \"Yoga Vasistha\" became an authoritative surce text in the Advaita vedanta tradition in the 14th century, while Vidyāraņya's \"Jivanmuktiviveka\" (14th century) was influenced by the \"(Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha\", which in turn was influenced by Kashmir Shaivism. Vivekananda's 19th century emphasis on \"nirvikalpa samadhi\" was preceded by medieaval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In thee 16th and 17th centuries, some Nath and hatha yoga texts also came within the scope of the Advaita vedanta tradition.\n\nAlready in medieval times, Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as the highest of the Indian religious philosophies, a development which was reinforced in modern times due to western interest in Advaita Vedanta, and the subsequent influence on western perceptions on Indian perceptions of Hinduism.\n\nIn contrast, King states that its present position was a response of Hindu intellectuals to centuries of Christian polemic aimed at establishing \"Hindu inferiority complex\" during the colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent. The \"humanistic, inclusivist\" formulation, now called Neo-Vedanta, attempted to respond to this colonial stereotyping of \"Indian culture was backward, superstitious and inferior to the West\", states King. Advaita Vedanta was projected as the central philosophy of Hinduism, and Neo-Vedanta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the Buddha a part of the Vedanta tradition, all in an attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. Thus, states King, neo-Vedanta developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism. With the efforts of Vivekananda, modern formulation of Advaita Vedanta has \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought\", though Hindu beliefs and practices are diverse.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta came to occupy a central position in the classification of various Hindu traditions. To some scholars, it is with the arrival of Islamic rule, first in the form of Delhi Sultanate thereafter the Mughal Empire, and the subsequent persecution of Indian religions, Hindu scholars began a self-conscious attempts to define an identity and unity. Between the twelfth and the fourteen century, according to Andrew Nicholson, this effort emerged with a classification of astika and nastika systems of Indian philosophies. Certain thinkers, according to Nicholson thesis, began to retrospectively classify ancient thought into \"six systems\" (\"saddarsana\") of mainstream Hindu philosophy.\n\nOther scholars, acknowledges Nicholson, present an alternate thesis. The scriptures such as the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, texts such as Dharmasutras and Puranas, and various ideas that are considered to be paradigmatic Hinduism are traceable to being thousands of years old. Unlike Christianity and Islam, Hinduism as a religion does not have a single founder, rather it is a fusion of diverse scholarship where a galaxy of thinkers openly challenged each other's teachings and offered their own ideas. The term \"Hindu\" too, states Arvind Sharma, appears in much older texts such as those in Arabic that record the Islamic invasion or regional rule of Indian subcontinent. Some of these texts have been dated to between the 8th and the 11th century. Within these \"doxologies\" and records, Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system.\n\nAccording to Sangeetha Menon, Sadaśiva Brahmendra was a prominent 18th century Advaita Vedantin.\n\nAccording to King, along with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule came orientalism wherein the new rulers viewed Indians through \"colonially crafted lenses\". In response, emerged Hindu nationalism for collective action against the colonial rule, against the caricature by Christian and Muslim communities, and for socio-political independence. In this colonial era search of identity, Vedanta came to be regarded as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as \"then paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion\" and umbrella of \"inclusivism\". This umbrella of Advaita Vedanta, according to King, \"provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression\".\n\nAmong the colonial era intelligentsia, according to Anshuman Mondal, a professor of Literature specializing in post-colonial studies, the monistic Advaita Vedanta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism. Mahatma Gandhi professed monism of Advaita Vedanta, though at times he also spoke with terms from mind-body dualism schools of Hinduism. Other colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda, presented Advaita Vedanta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity, and the rise of Hindu nationalism as a counter weight to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the Muslim League, to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions.\n\nA major proponent in the popularisation of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was Vivekananda, who played a major role in the revival of Hinduism, and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the Ramakrishna Mission. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called \"Neo-Vedanta\". Vivekananda discerned a universal religion, regarding all the apparent differences between various traditions as various manifestations of one truth. He presented karma, bhakti, jnana and raja yoga as equal means to attain moksha, to present Vedanta as a liberal and universal religion, in contrast to the exclusivism of other religions.\n\nVivekananda emphasised \"nirvikalpa\" samadhi as the spiritual goal of Vedanta, he equated it to the liberation in Yoga and encouraged Yoga practice he called \"Raja yoga\". This approach, however, is missing in historic Advaita texts. In 1896, Vivekananda claimed that Advaita appeals to modern scientists:\nAccording to Rambachan, Vivekananda interprets \"anubhava\" as to mean \"personal experience\", akin to religious experience, whereas Shankara used the term to denote liberating understanding of the \"sruti\".\n\nVivekananda's claims about spirituality as \"science\" and modern, according to David Miller, may be questioned by well informed scientists, but it drew attention for being very different than how Christianity and Islam were being viewed by scientists and sociologists of his era.\n\nSarvepalli Radhakrishnan, first a professor at Oxford University and later a President of India, further popularized Advaita Vedanta, presenting it as the essence of Hinduism. According to Michael Hawley, a professor of Religious Studies, Radhakrishnan saw other religions, as well as \"what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,\" as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby \"in a sense Hindusizing all religions\". To him, the world faces a religious problem, where there is unreflective dogmatism and exclusivism, creating a need for \"experiential religion\" and \"inclusivism\". Advaita Vedanta, claimed Radhakrishnan, best exemplifies a Hindu philosophical, theological, and literary tradition that fulfills this need. Radhakrishnan did not emphasize the differences between Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism versus Hinduism that he defined in terms of Advaita Vedanta, rather he tended to minimize their differences. This is apparent, for example, in his discussions of Buddhist \"Madhyamika and Yogacara\" traditions versus the Advaita Vedanta tradition.\n\nRadhakrishnan metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for contemporary needs and context. He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the transcendent metaphysical absolute concept (\"nirguna\" Brahman). Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of \"maya\". According to Radhakrishnan, \"maya\" is not a strict absolute idealism, but \"a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real.\"\n\nGandhi declared his allegiance to Advaita Vedanta, and was another popularizing force for its ideas. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that \"atman\" exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this \"atman\". Gandhi called himself advaitist many times, including his letters, but he believed that others have a right to a viewpoint different than his own because they come from a different background and perspective. According to Gier, Gandhi did not interpret \"maya\" as illusion, but accepted that \"personal theism\" leading to \"impersonal monism\" as two tiers of religiosity.\n\nContemporary teachers are the orthodox Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham; the more traditional teachers Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963), Chinmayananda Saraswati, and Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya); and less traditional teachers such as Narayana Guru. According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in 20th century Advaita tradition are Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami, Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal, Sacchidānandendra Saraswati.\n\n\"Neo-Advaita\" is a New Religious Movement based on a popularised, western interpretation of Advaita Vedanta and the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. Neo-Advaita is being criticised for discarding the traditional prerequisites of knowledge of the scriptures and \"renunciation as necessary preparation for the path of \"jnana\"-yoga\". Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja, his students Gangaji Andrew Cohen, and Eckhart Tolle.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta has gained attention in western spirituality and New Age, where various traditions are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience. Nonduality points to \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\". It is also used to refer to interconnectedness, \"the sense that all things are interconnected and not separate, while at the same time all things retain their individuality\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation. Philosophy and renunciation are closely related:\n\nShankara organized monks under 10 names and established mathas for them. These mathas contributed to the influence of Shankara, which was \"due to institutional factors\". The mathas which he built exist until today, and preserve the teachings and influence of Shankara, \"while the writings of other scholars before him came to be forgotten with the passage of time\".\n\nAround 740 CE, Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, also known as . It is located in Kavale, Ponda, Goa, and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins.\n\nShankara, himself considered to be an incarnation of Shiva, established the Dashanami Sampradaya, organizing a section of the Ekadandi monks under an umbrella grouping of ten names.\nSeveral Hindu monastic and Ekadandi traditions, however, remained outside the organisation of the Dasanāmis.\n\nSankara organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four (Sanskrit: ) (monasteries), called the \"Amnaya Mathas\", with the headquarters at Dvārakā in the West, Jagannatha Puri in the East, Sringeri in the South and Badrikashrama in the North. Each math was first headed by one of his four main disciples, and the tradition continues since then. According to another tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's samadhi at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the four \"Amnaya Mathas\" founded by Adi Shankara, and their details.\nMonks of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes made by Shankara. While the dasanāmis associated with the Sankara maths follow the procedures enumerated by Adi Śankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Sankara maths. The advaita sampradaya is not a Saiva sect, despite the historical links with Shaivism. Nevertheless, contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedanta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism) of Ramanuja, and the 14th-century Dvaita (theistic dualism) of Madhvacharya.\n\nRamanuja's Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedanta believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned. Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (soul) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the \"nirguna\" Brahman. In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and \"saguna\" Brahman with attributes is also real. God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God's body. The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (\"saguna\" Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with \"nirguna\" Brahman.\n\nVallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world. That is why shuddhadvaita is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss).\n\nMadhvacharya was also a critic of Advaita Vedanta. Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are identical, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, and there are no pluralities. Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities. Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism were a nihilistic school of thought. Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including \"Upadhikhandana\" and \"Tattvadyota\", primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.\n\nScholars are divided on the historical influence of Advaita Vedanta. Some Indologists state that it is one of the most studied Hindu philosophy and the most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Advaita Vedanta, states Eliot Deutsch, \"has been and continues to be the most widely accepted system of thought among philosophers in India, and it is, we believe, one of the greatest philosophical achievements to be found in the East or the West\".\n\nThe Smarta tradition of Hinduism is an ancient tradition, particularly found in south and west India, that revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit. Their worship practice is called \"Panchayatana puja\". The worship symbolically consists of five deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata or any personal god of devotee's preference.\n\nIn the Smarta tradition, Advaita Vedanta ideas combined with bhakti are its foundation. Adi Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smarta. According to Alf Hiltebeitel, Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and practices became the doctrinal unifier of previously conflicting practices with the \"smarta\" tradition.\n\nPhilosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images and statues (murti), or just five marks or any anicons on the ground, are visibly convenient icons of spirituality \"saguna Brahman\". The multiple icons are seen as multiple representations of the same idea, rather than as distinct beings. These serve as a step and means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman – as \"That art Thou\".\n\nWithin the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, the ideas of Advaita Vedanta have had a major influence. Advaita Vedanta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India. One of its most popular text, the \"Bhagavata Purana\", adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedanta philosophy. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE.\n\nIn the ancient and medieval literature of Shaivism, called the \"Āgamas\", the influence of Advaita Vedanta is once again prominent. Of the 92 \"Āgamas\", ten are \"Dvaita\" texts, eighteen are \"Bhedabheda\", and sixty-four are \"Advaita\" texts. According to Natalia Isaeva, there is an evident and natural link between 6th-century Gaudapada's Advaita Vedanta ideas and Kashmir Shaivism.\n\nShaktism, the Hindu tradition where a goddess is considered identical to Brahman, has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of Advaita Vedanta and dualism premises of Samkhya–Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as \"Shaktadavaitavada\" (literally, the path of nondualistic \"Shakti\").\n\nOther influential ancient and medieval classical texts of Hinduism such as the \"Yoga Yajnavalkya\", \"Yoga Vashishta\", \"Avadhuta Gita\", \"Markandeya Purana\" and \"Sannyasa Upanishads\" predominantly incorporate premises and ideas of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism share similarities and have differences, their relationship a subject of dispute among scholars. The similarities between Advaita and Buddhism have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention, and have also been criticised by concurring schools. The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta, while others deny such influences, or see them as variant expressions. According to Daniel Ingalls, the Japanese Buddhist scholarship has argued that Adi Shankara did not understand Buddhism.\n\nSome Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its \"Maya\" and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism. Ramanuja, the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, accused Adi Shankara of being a \"Prachanna Bauddha\", that is, a \"crypto-Buddhist\", and someone who was undermining theistic Bhakti devotionalism. The non-Advaita scholar Bhaskara of the Bhedabheda Vedanta tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as \"this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists\", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.\n\nA few Buddhist scholars made the opposite criticism in the medieval era toward their Buddhist opponents. In the sixth century CE, for example, the Mahayana Buddhist scholar Bhaviveka redefined Vedantic concepts to show how they fit into Madhyamaka concepts, and \"equate[d] the Buddha's Dharma body with Brahman, the ultimate reality of the Upanishads.\" In his \"Madhyamakahṛdayakārikaḥ\", Bhaviveka stages a Hinayana (Theravada) interlocutor, who accuses Mahayana Buddhists of being \"crypto-Vedantins\". Medieval era Tibetan Gelugpa scholars accused the Jonang school of being \"crypto-Vedantist.\" Contemporary scholar David Kalupahana called the seventh century Buddhist scholar Chandrakirti a \"crypto-Vedantist\", a view rejected by scholars of Madhayamika Buddhism.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on \"Atman\", \"Anatta\" and \"Brahman\".\n\nAccording to scholars, the influence of Mahayana Buddhism on Advaita Vedanta has been significant. Advaita Vedanta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism. According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O. Rozenberg, \"a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.\"\n\nBoth traditions hold that \"the empirical world is transitory, a show of appearances\", and both admit \"degrees of truth or existence\". Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions. Adi Shankara, states Natalia Isaeva, incorporated \"into his own system a Buddhist notion of \"maya\" which had not been minutely elaborated in the Upanishads\". Similarly, there are many points of contact between Buddhism's Vijnanavada and Shankara's Advaita.\n\nAccording to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism.\n\nDasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta represent \"different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara.\" The influence of Mahayana Buddhism on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the Visuddhimagga of Theravada Buddhism tradition contains \"some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the Yogacarins\". According to John Plott,\nThe influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gaudapada has been a vexed question.\n\nOne school of scholars, such as Bhattacharya and Raju, state that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (\"vijñapti-mātra\") and \"that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation, which is the structure of Māyā\".\n\nOf particular interest is Chapter Four of Gaudapada's text \"Karika\", in which according to Bhattacharya, two karikas refer to the Buddha and the term \"Asparsayoga\" is borrowed from Buddhism. According to Murti, \"the conclusion is irresistible that Gaudapada, a Vedanta philosopher, is attempting an Advaitic interpretation of Vedanta in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines. He even freely quotes and appeals to them.\" However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Chapter One, Two and Three are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Further, state both Murti and King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three. According to Sarma, \"to mistake him [Gaudapada] to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd\". The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti:\n\nAdvaitins have traditionally challenged the Buddhist influence thesis. Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. Gaudapada adopted some Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings. While there is shared terminology, the Advaita doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta holds the premise, \"Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \"Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or \"Anatta\", non-self) is self evident\".\n\nIn Buddhism, \"Anatta\" (Pali, Sanskrit cognate An-atman) is the concept that in human beings and living creatures, there is no \"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\". Buddhist philosophy rejects the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (\"maya\"), asserting instead the theory of \"no-self\" and \"no-soul\". Most schools of Buddhism, from its earliest days, have denied the existence of the \"self, soul\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In contrast to Advaita, which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to \"nirvana\", in its soteriological themes Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has \"no self, no soul\".\n\nSome Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtras\" suggest self-like concepts, variously called \"Tathagatagarbha\" or \"Buddha nature\". These have been controversial idea in Buddhism, and \"eternal self\" concepts have been generally rejected. In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these \"self-like\" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. Some scholars posit that the \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.\n\nThe epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article). However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's \"Śabda\" pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta posits a substance ontology, an ontology which holds that underlying the change and impermanence of empirical reality is an unchanging and permanent absolute reality, like an eternal substance it calls Atman-Brahman. In its substance ontology, as like other philosophies, there exist a universal, particulars and specific properties and it is the interaction of particulars that create events and processes.\n\nIn contrast, Buddhism posits a process ontology, also called as \"event ontology\". According to the Buddhist thought, particularly after the rise of ancient Mahayana Buddhism scholarship, there is neither empirical nor absolute permanent reality and ontology can be explained as a process. There is a system of relations and interdependent phenomena (\"pratitya samutpada\") in Buddhist ontology, but no stable persistent identities, no eternal universals nor particulars. Thought and memories are mental constructions and fluid processes without a real observer, personal agency or cognizer in Buddhism. In contrast, in Advaita Vedanta, like other schools of Hinduism, the concept of self (atman) is the real on-looker, personal agent and cognizer.\n\nThe Pali Abdhidhamma and Theravada Buddhism considered all existence as \"dhamma\", and left the ontological questions about reality and the nature of \"dhamma\" unexplained.\n\nAccording to Renard, Advaita's theory of three levels of reality is built on the two levels of reality found in the Madhyamika.\n\nA central concern for Shankara, in his objections against Buddhism, is what he perceives as nihilism of the Buddhists. Shankara states that there \"must be something beyond cognition, namely a cognizer,\" which he asserts is the self-evident \"Atman\" or witness. Buddhism, according to Shankara, denies the cognizer. He also considers the notion of Brahman as pure knowledge and \"the quintessence of positive reality.\"\n\nThe teachings in Brahma Sutras, states Shankara, differ from both the Buddhist realists and the Buddhist idealists. Shankara elaborates on these arguments against various schools of Buddhism, partly presenting refutations which were already standard in his time, and partly offering his own objections. Shankara's original contribution in explaining the difference between Advaita and Buddhism was his \"argument for identity\" and the \"argument for the witness\". In Shankara's view, the Buddhist are internally inconsistent in their theories, because \"the reservoir-consciousness that [they] set up, being momentary, is no better than ordinary consciousness. Or, if [they] allow the reservoir-consciousness to be lasting, [they] destroy [their] theory of momentariness.\" In response to the idealists, he notes that their \"alaya-vijnana\", or store-house consciousness, runs counter to the Buddhist theory of momentariness. With regard to the \"Sunyavada\" (Madhyamaka), Shankara states that \"being contradictory to all valid means of knowledge, we have not thought worth while to refute\" and \"common sense (\"loka-vyavahara\") cannot be denied without the discovery of some other truth\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is most often regarded as an idealist monism. According to King, Advaita Vedanta developed \"to its ultimate extreme\" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads. In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedanta \"monistic,\" since this confuses the \"negation of difference\" with \"conflation into one.\" \"Advaita\" is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the \"negation of a difference,\" between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived. \n\nAccording to Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta teaches monistic oneness, however without the multiplicity premise of alternate monism theories. According to Jacqueline Hirst, Adi Shankara positively emphasizes \"oneness\" premise in his Brahma-sutra Bhasya 2.1.20, attributing it to all the Upanishads.\n\nNicholson states Advaita Vedanta contains realistic strands of thought, both in its oldest origins and in Shankara's writings.\n\nBhramara-kita-nyaya is based on the analogy of the wasp and the caterpillar, which states how the caterpillar gets transformed into a wasp by intense thinking of the latter. Similarly, the Jiva becomes Brahman itself by meditating intensely on Brahman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He made his doctoral studies under Martin Heidegger's direction, in 1940.\n\nDragomir refused to publish any of his writing. He always maintained that publishing was of no importance to him; instead, genuine understanding was all that mattered. Thus he never got involved with the public cultural milieu. Before his death, no one even knew whether he had actually written anything, or not.\n\nWalter Biemel recollects that Heidegger much appreciated Dragomir's brightness. Dragomir attended Heidegger's private seminars and it is said that, when the discussion seemed to stall, Heidegger would turn to him and say: “Eh, what do the Latins say? ”. Dragomir was a close friend of Biemel, with whom he translated “What is metaphysics? ” into Romanian (in 1942).\n\nAt the end of 1943, Dragomir was obliged to leave Freiburg im Breisgau and Heidegger's seminars and return to Romania to be conscripted. It was the beginning of war. Even Heidegger's insistence to prolong his stay in Freiburg could not prevent his departure. In 1945, the end of the war coincided with the Russian occupation and the introduction of communism in Romania; Dragomir saw himself unable to continue his thesis with Heidegger. He understood that his connections with Germany could be reasons for political persecution and that his interest in philosophy could trigger his prosecution. Dragomir understood that his life depended on his ability to hide his interest in philosophy and to efface his ties with Germany. While continuously erasing the traces of his past, Dragomir worked in all possible trades: welder, salesman, civil servant or accountant, always changing jobs, being regularly fired because of his politically unsuitable “file”. Finally, he was an economist with the Ministry for Wood until his retirement in 1976. After 1985, he agreed to make a compromise as far as his silence on his philosophical activity: he decided to hold several seminars with the disciples of Noica: Gabriel Liiceanu, Andrei Pleșu, Sorin Vieru.\n\nIn 2002, a hundred books with notes, comments on traditional philosophical texts, tests of investigation and phenomenologic analysis, philosophical and extremely subtle descriptions were found at his home. Most of the texts are phenomenologic microanalyses of various concrete aspects of life. Texts were found that dealt with themes such as the mirror, lapse of memory, error, [...], the morning alarm clock, what one calls ugly and disgusting, attention - because of being wrong about oneself, writing and orality - because of distinguishing and [...], uniqueness and so on. They are disparate and heterogeneous subjects, as if Dragomir had let his phenomenologic magnifier fall upon the diversity of the world and chose to analyze, for his own desire to comprehend, with no other end, such and such fact or such and such aspect of reality.\n\nHowever, one of his topics is constant: it is to be found in a series of books, entitled Chronos, in which Dragomir systematically looked into the problem of time for several decades: the first book goes back to 1948 and it includes several notes written in German, while the last one covers the period between 1980 and 1990. This discovery enabled the recovery of Dragomir's work. Three volumes have been already published by the Humanitas publishing house to-date: \"Crase banalităţi metafizice\" (\"Utter metaphysical banalities\", 2004), \"Cinci plecări din prezent. Exerciţii fenomenologice\" (\"Five departures from present. Phenomenological exercises\", 2005), and \"Caietele timpului\" (\"The Time Notebooks\", 2006). Five more volumes are envisaged for publication. Lastly, to prevent any further delay in the reception of this thinker abroad, a number of the Studia Phænomenologica magazine was dedicated to him, featuring texts by Dragomir translated into French, English and German, as well as texts about his personality, according to the ones who knew him and who could testify for his life and his manner of philosophizing. Other translations appeared in the French review “Alter”.\n\n\n"}

He is the author of \"The Secular Conscience: Why Belief Belongs in Public Life\", \"The Future of Blasphemy: Speaking of the Sacred in an Age of Human Rights\", and a 2006 \"New York Times\" op-ed entitled \"Believing in Doubt,\" which criticized the ethical views of Pope Benedict. He is a representative to the United Nations for the International Humanist and Ethical Union and the creator and director of The Impossible Music Sessions.\n\nDacey was raised in the rural Midwest by liberal Catholics. His father Philip Dacey is a poet. As a young teenager, Dacey became an evangelical Protestant, playing in the Christian alternative rock band, The Swoon, which in 1990 released an EP produced by Charlie Peacock. While studying music and philosophy at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, Dacey lost his religion, explaining later that \"God stopped returning my calls.\" He studied applied ethics and social philosophy at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, and was awarded a doctorate in 2002. In 2005, he debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig over the existence of God.\n\nBeginning in 1999, Dacey worked for the Center for Inquiry (CFI), a think tank that seeks \"to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values.\" He opened the New York City branch office of CFI and later served as the organization's representative to the United Nations. In 2009, Dacey left CFI and published a critique of the secular movement. In 2010, he created The Impossible Music Sessions, a forum in New York City for censored and persecuted musicians. He has taught ethics at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University.\n\nDacey has defended a form of secularism emphasizing the values of \"individual autonomy, equal rights and freedom of conscience.\" Religion News Service dubbed him a member of Atheism 3.0, a designation he contests. He claims that secularism is not atheistic, but instead that it comes \"before God.\" Aspects of Dacey's position have been embraced by religious thinkers such as Richard John Neuhaus, Andrew Sullivan, and Rabbi Marc Gellman as well as secular figures such as Sam Harris, Susan Jacoby, Ibn Warraq, and Peter Singer.\n\nIn \"The Secular Conscience\", Dacey argues that contemporary secular liberalism has \"lost its soul\" due to misconceptions he labels the Privacy Fallacy and the Liberty Fallacy. The Privacy Fallacy lies in thinking that \"because matters of conscience are private in the sense of nongovernmental, they are private in the sense of personal preference.\" The Liberty Fallacy lies in thinking that \"because conscience must be free from coercion, its moral conclusions must also be free from public criticism.\" This confused thinking, according to Dacey, leads to \"the conclusion that controversial religious and moral claims are beyond evaluation by reason, truth and objective standards of right and wrong, and should therefore be precluded from public conversation.\"\n\nIn place of the \"privacy of conscience,\" Dacey defends a model of the \"openness of conscience,\" comparing conscience to a free press. It is to be protected from coercion so that it can be free to play an important role in the public sphere and free to follow its own objective standards. Reasons of conscience are by their nature shareable, not subjective. Dacey uses the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac to illustrate the thesis that \"any act of faith depends on a prior act of conscience.\"\n\nBy precluding conscience from public debate, secular liberals had hoped to prevent believers from introducing sectarian beliefs into politics. Instead, the \"gag order\" has prevented secular liberals from subjecting religious claims to \"due public scrutiny\" and from advancing their own views in robustly moral terms, granting a \"monopoly on the language of ethics and values\" to the religious on the Right and the Left. Dacey argues that claims of conscience—including religious claims—cannot be barred from public debate, but that they can and must be held to the same critical conversational standards as all serious contributions to public debate.\n\nWhile advocating the separation of religion and state, Dacey has suggested that political institutions should be designed to protect the exercise of conscience, not religion as such. In \"Against Religious Freedom\", a 2010 article in Dissent co-authored with Colin Koproske, he argues that religious freedom should be regarded as \"one manifestation of more fundamental rights held by all people, religious and secular alike: private property, personal autonomy, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and perhaps most important, freedom of conscience.\"\n\nCriticizing the failure of some on the Left in the West to support secular liberal forces in the Arab and Muslim world, Dacey has stressed the importance of religious rationales for secularism. He has analogized religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries to dissident Protestant sects such as the Anabaptists who constructed theological arguments for toleration and church-state separation in early modern Europe.\n\nDacey was a lead organizer of the Secular Islam Summit in March 2007, described by the \"Wall Street Journal\" as \"a landmark.\" The conference issued the St. Petersburg Declaration, a statement of principles endorsed by Mithal al-Alusi, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and Shahriar Kabir among others. Reviewing The Secular Conscience for Asharq Al-Awsat, Amir Taheri wrote, \"[m]aking this book available in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and other languages of the Muslim nations would be an immense service.\"\n\nAs a representative of civil society organizations at the United Nations, Dacey has participated in lobbying at Human Rights Council in Geneva. to oppose efforts by some member states to diminish international standards of freedom of expression out of \"respect for religions and beliefs.\" \"The ultimate aim of this effort is not to protect the feelings of Muslims,\" Dacey has commented, \"but to protect illiberal Islamic states from charges of human rights abuse, and to silence the voices of internal dissidents calling for more secular government and freedom.\"\n\nIn defending a universal human right to blaspheme, Dacey has emphasized that it is a matter of freedom of conscience as much as just freedom of speech. In \"The Future of Blasphemy\", Dacey contends that debates in the international community about religiously offensive expression should be understood as \"contests over what counts as sacred\" in which unbelievers and heterodox believers reserve a right of conscience to express their views.\n\nIn September 2008, Dacey co-authored the CFI report, \"Islam and Human Rights: Defending Universality at the United Nations\", which puts these efforts in the context of a campaign by the intergovernmental Organization of the Islamic Conference to promulgate culturally specific \"Islamic human rights.\"\n\nDacey also authored a CFI position paper accusing the UN Alliance of Civilizations of neglecting secular perspectives and perpetuating the \"problematic division of the social world by religion\" for which the \"clash of civilizations\" thesis is often faulted. There is a \"clash of values\" but it is taking place \"\"within\" societies and cultures, not only between them.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Dacey launched The Impossible Music Sessions, a forum in Brooklyn that features \"artists who cannot appear and the music they are not free to make.\" Featured artists join via Internet streaming or phone as a counterpart with whom they have collaborated in advance performs a live interpretation of their music. Mark LeVine wrote in the Huffington Post that the first Impossible Music Session \"will go down in the annals of rock history.\" The Sessions are produced in cooperation with Freemuse: The World Forum on Music and Censorship.\n\nIn an interview, Dacey commented, \"Ironically, in the Internet age, the live performance has become even more important. The thing that's frustrating for these groups is that while they can record on their Macbook in their basement and share the music with their friends, the government and other powerful forces in society—they control the public spaces. . . . there's something magical about standing in front of people and playing.\"\n\nSince 2010, the Sessions have facilitated collaborations between musicians in North America and musicians in Iran, Guinea Bissau, Cameroon, and Cuba. Dacey told the \"Wall Street Journal\" that the purpose is to \"crosspollinate musically\" and \"banish isolation.\"\n\nFrom his early work with the Center for Inquiry, Dacey has been interested in the cultural implications of science. In 2004 he argued in Skeptical Inquirer that \"science is making us more ignorant\" by unsettling received cultural understandings of the self, meaning, and morality without replacing them with coherent alternatives. In a column for \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Dacey explores the significance of the \"culture of science\" in Islamic, Chinese, and Indian cultural contexts.\n\nDacey coined the term \"accommodationism\" to describe those \"who either recognize no conflicts between religion and science, or who recognize such conflicts but are disinclined to discuss them publicly,\" a usage which has been adopted in blogosphere debates about creationism and the New Atheism.\n\nA sympathetic critic of organized transhumanism, Dacey is an advocate of culturing meat as an ethical alternative to using animals for meat.\n\nIn a 2004 article for Free Inquiry magazine, \"Atheism is Not a Civil Rights Issue,\" Dacey and co-author DJ Grothe criticized comparisons between the atheist cause in the United States and the causes of civil rights and LGBT rights, concluding that atheists \"need a public awareness campaign, not a liberation movement.\" The article was attacked by humanists and the atheist blogger PZ Myers.\n\nThe Secular Islam Summit was criticized by representatives of the Council on American-Islamic Relations as being organized by non-Muslims and \"neo-cons\" with no standing in Islam.\n\n\"The Guardian\" compared Dacey to the British conservative author Melanie Phillips and associated him with the idea that \"our civilization depends on the freedom to publish racist cartoons.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" questioned whether Dacey has fairly characterized secular liberalism, and commented that many people \"will balk at his plea that liberalism place 'global resistance to theocratic Islam at the center of its agenda,' much the way a generation of cold-war liberals once mobilized around anti-Communism.\n\n"}
{"id": "1022185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1022185", "title": "Baldwin effect", "text": "Baldwin effect\n\nIn evolutionary biology, the Baldwin effect describes the effect of learned behavior on evolution. In brief, James Mark Baldwin and others suggested during the eclipse of Darwinism in the late 19th century that an organism's \"ability to learn\" new behaviors (e.g. to acclimatise to a new stressor) will affect its reproductive success and will therefore have an effect on the genetic makeup of its species through natural selection. Though this process appears similar to Lamarckian evolution, Lamarck proposed that living things \"inherited\" their parents' acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect has been independently proposed several times, and today it is generally recognized as part of the modern synthesis.\n\nThe effect, then unnamed, was put forward in 1896 in a paper \"A New Factor in Evolution\" by American psychologist James Mark Baldwin. The paper proposed a mechanism for specific selection for general learning ability. As Robert Richards explains:\nIf animals entered a new environment—or their old environment rapidly changed—those\nthat could flexibly respond by learning new behaviors or by ontogenetically adapting would\nbe naturally preserved. This saved remnant would, over several generations, have the\nopportunity to exhibit spontaneously congenital variations similar to their acquired traits and\nhave these variations naturally selected. It would look as though the acquired traits had sunk\ninto the hereditary substance in a Lamarckian fashion, but the process would really be neo-Darwinian.\nSelected offspring would tend to have an increased capacity for learning new skills rather than being confined to genetically coded, relatively fixed abilities. In effect, it places emphasis on the fact that the sustained behavior of a species or group can shape the evolution of that species. The \"Baldwin effect\" is better understood in evolutionary developmental biology literature as a scenario in which a character or trait change occurring in an organism as a result of its interaction with its environment becomes gradually assimilated into its developmental genetic or epigenetic repertoire (Simpson, 1953; Newman, 2002). In the words of Daniel Dennett,\nThanks to the Baldwin effect, species can be said to pretest the efficacy of particular different designs by phenotypic (individual) exploration of the space of nearby possibilities. If a particularly winning setting is thereby discovered, this discovery will \"create\" a new selection pressure: organisms that are closer in the adaptive landscape to that discovery will have a clear advantage over those more distant.\nAn update to the Baldwin Effect was developed by Jean Piaget, Paul Weiss, and Conrad Waddington in the 1960s–1970s. This new version included an explicit role for the social in shaping subsequent natural change in humans (both evolutionary and developmental), with reference to alterations of selection pressures.\n\nAs is to be expected from Stigler's law, subsequent research shows that Baldwin was not the first to identify the process; Douglas Spalding mentioned it in 1873.\n\nSuppose a species is threatened by a new predator and there is a behavior that makes it more difficult for the predator to kill individuals of the species. Individuals who learn the behavior more quickly will obviously be at an advantage. As time goes on, the ability to learn the behavior will improve (by genetic selection), and at some point it will seem to be an instinct.\n\nBaldwin gives the following case involving cooperation: \"Animals may be kept alive let us say in a given environment by social cooperation only; these transmit this social type of variation to posterity; thus social adaptation sets the direction of physical phylogeny and physical heredity is determined in part by this factor\" (Baldwin, 1896, p. 553).\n\nThe appearance of lactose tolerance in human populations with a long tradition of raising domesticated animals for milk production has been suggested as another example. This argument holds that a feedback loop operates whereby a dairy culture increases the selective advantage from this genetic trait, while the average population genotype increases the collective rewards of a dairy culture.\n\nInitially Baldwin's ideas were not incompatible with the prevailing, but uncertain, ideas about the mechanism of transmission of hereditary information and at least two other biologists put forward very similar ideas in 1896. In 1901, Maurice Maeterlinck referred to behavioural adaptations to prevailing climates in different species of bees as ‘what had merely been an idea, therefore, and opposed to instinct, has thus by slow degrees become an instinctive habit’. The Baldwin effect theory subsequently became more controversial, with scholars being split between \"Baldwin boosters\" and \"Baldwin skeptics\". The theory was first called the \"Baldwin effect\" by George Gaylord Simpson in 1953. Simpson \"admitted that the idea was theoretically consistent, that is, not inconsistent with the modern synthesis\", but he doubted that the phenomenon occurred very often, or if so, could be proven to occur. In his discussion of the reception of the Baldwin-effect theory Simpson points out that the theory appears to provide a reconciliation between a neo-Darwinian and a neo-Lamarckian approach and that \"Mendelism and later genetic theory so conclusively ruled out the extreme neo-Lamarckian position that reconciliation came to seem unnecessary\". In 1942, the evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley promoted the Baldwin effect as part of the modern synthesis, saying the concept had been unduly neglected by evolutionists.\n\nIn the 1960s, the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr contended that the Baldwin effect theory was untenable because\n\nIn 1987 Geoffrey Hinton and Steven Nowlan demonstrated by computer simulation that learning can accelerate evolution, and they associated this with the Baldwin effect.\n\nPaul Griffiths suggests two reasons for the continuing interest in the Baldwin effect. The first is the role \"mind\" is understood to play in the effect. The second is the connection between \"development\" and evolution in the effect. Baldwin’s account of how neurophysiological and conscious mental factors may contribute to the effect brings into focus the question of the possible survival value of consciousness.\n\nStill, observes David Depew, \"it is striking that a rather diverse lot of contemporary evolutionary theorists, most of whom regard themselves as supporters of the Modern Synthesis, have of late become 'Baldwin boosters These Baldwin boosters\nare typically evolutionary psychologists who are searching for scenarios in which a population can get itself by behavioral trial and error onto a \"hard to find\" part of the fitness landscape in which human brain, language, and mind can rapidly coevolve. They are searching for what Daniel Dennett, himself a Baldwin booster, calls an \"evolutionary crane,\" an instrument to do some heavy lifting fast.\nAccording to Daniel Dennett, recent work has rendered the Baldwin effect \"no longer a controversial wrinkle in orthodox Darwinism\". Potential genetic mechanisms underlying the Baldwin effect have been proposed for the evolution of natural (genetically-determinant) antibodies. In 2009, empirical evidence for the Baldwin effect was provided from the colonisation of North America by the house finch.\n\nThe Baldwin effect has been confused with, and sometimes conflated with, a different evolutionary theory also based on phenotypic plasticity, C. H. Waddington's genetic assimilation. The Baldwin effect includes genetic accommodation, of which one type is genetic assimilation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "315845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315845", "title": "Executive privilege", "text": "Executive privilege\n\nExecutive privilege is the power of the President of the United States and other members of the executive branch of the United States Government to resist certain subpoenas and other interventions by the legislative and judicial branches of government in pursuit of information or personnel relating to the executive. The power of Congress or the federal courts to obtain such information is not mentioned explicitly in the United States Constitution, nor is there any explicit mention in the Constitution of an executive privilege to resist such requests from Congress or courts. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled this privilege may qualify as an element of the separation of powers doctrine, derived from the supremacy of the executive branch in its own area of Constitutional activity.\n\nThe Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in \"United States v. Nixon\" in the context of a subpoena emanating from the judiciary, instead of emanating from Congress. The Court held that there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked, creates a presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must then make a \"sufficient showing\" that the \"Presidential material\" is \"essential to the justice of the case\". Chief Justice Warren Burger further stated that executive privilege would most effectively apply when the oversight of the executive would impair that branch's national security concerns. Regarding requests from Congress (instead of from the courts) for executive branch information, as of a 2014 study by the Congressional Research Service, only two federal court cases had addressed the merits of executive privilege in such a context, and neither of those cases reached the Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition to which branch of government is requesting the information, another characteristic of executive privilege is whether it involves a \"presidential communications privilege\" or instead a \"deliberative process privilege\" or some other type of privilege. The deliberative process privilege is often considered to be rooted in common law, whereas the presidential communications privilege is often considered to be rooted in separation of powers, thus making the deliberative process privilege less difficult to overcome. Generally speaking, presidents, congresses and courts have historically tended to sidestep open confrontations through compromise and mutual deference in view of previous practice and precedents regarding the exercise of executive privilege.\n\nDeliberative process privilege is a specific instance of the more general principle of executive privilege. It is usually considered to be based upon common law rather than separation of powers, and its history traces back to the English crown privilege (now known as public-interest immunity). In contrast, the presidential communications privilege is another specific instance of executive privilege, usually considered as being based upon separation of powers, and for that reason it is more difficult to overcome than deliberative process privilege. A significant requirement of the presidential communications privilege is that it can only protect communications sent or received by the President or his immediate advisors, whereas the deliberative process privilege may extend further down the chain of command.\n\nIn the context of privilege assertions by United States presidents, law professor Michael Dorf has written: \"In 1796, President George Washington refused to comply with a request by the House of Representatives for documents related to the negotiation of the then-recently adopted Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Senate alone plays a role in the ratification of treaties, Washington reasoned, and therefore the House had no legitimate claim to the material. Therefore, Washington provided the documents to the Senate but not the House.\"\n\nPresident Thomas Jefferson continued the precedent for this in the trial of Aaron Burr for treason in 1809. Burr asked the court to issue a \"subpoena duces tecum\" to compel Jefferson to testify or provide his private letters concerning Burr. Chief Justice John Marshall, a strong proponent of the powers of the federal government but also a political opponent of Jefferson, ruled that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which allows for these sorts of court orders for criminal defendants, did not provide any exception for the president. As for Jefferson's claim that disclosure of the document would imperil public safety, Marshall held that the court, not the president, would be the judge of that. Jefferson refused to personally testify but provided selected letters.\n\nIn 1833, President Andrew Jackson cited executive privilege when Senator Henry Clay demanded he produce documents concerning statements the president made to his cabinet about the removal of federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War.\n\nDuring the period of 1947–49, several major security cases became known to Congress. There followed a series of investigations, culminating in the famous Hiss-Chambers case of 1948. At that point, the Truman Administration issued a sweeping secrecy order blocking congressional efforts from FBI and other executive data on security problems. Security files were moved to the White House and Administration officials were banned from testifying before Congress on security related matters. Investigation of the State Department and other cases was stymied and the matter left unresolved.\n\nDuring the Army–McCarthy hearings in 1954, Eisenhower used the claim of executive privilege to forbid the \"provision of any data about internal conversations, meetings, or written communication among staffers, with no exception to topics or people.\" Department of Defense employees were also instructed not to testify on any such conversations or produce any such documents or reproductions. This was done to refuse the McCarthy Committee subpoenas of transcripts of monitored telephone calls from Army officials, as well as information on meetings between Eisenhower officials relating to the hearings. This was done in the form of a letter from Eisenhower to the Department of Defense and an accompanying memo from Eisenhower Justice. The reasoning behind the order was that there was a need for \"candid\" exchanges among executive employees in giving \"advice\" to one another. In the end, Eisenhower would invoke the claim 44 times between 1955 and 1960.\n\nThe Supreme Court addressed \"executive privilege\" in \"United States v. Nixon\", the 1974 case involving the demand by Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox that President Richard Nixon produce the audiotapes of conversations he and his colleagues had in the Oval Office of the White House in connection with criminal charges being brought against members of the Nixon Administration. Nixon invoked the privilege and refused to produce any records.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not reject the claim of privilege out of hand; it noted, in fact, \"the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties\" and that \"[h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process.\" This is very similar to the logic that the Court had used in establishing an \"executive immunity\" defense for high office-holders charged with violating citizens' constitutional rights in the course of performing their duties. The Supreme Court stated: \"To read the Article II powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of 'a workable government' and gravely impair the role of the courts under Article III.\" Because Nixon had asserted only a generalized need for confidentiality, the Court held that the larger public interest in obtaining the truth in the context of a criminal prosecution took precedence.\n\n\"Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government are set on a collision course. The Judiciary is forced into the difficult task of balancing the need for information in a judicial proceeding and the Executive's Article II prerogatives. This inquiry places courts in the awkward position of evaluating the Executive's claims of confidentiality and autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions of separation of powers and checks and balances. These 'occasion[s] for constitutional confrontation between the two branches' are likely to be avoided whenever possible. United States v. Nixon, supra, at 692.\"\n\nIn November 1982, President Ronald Reagan signed a directive regarding congressional requests for information. Reagan wrote that if Congress seeks information potentially subject to executive privilege, then executive branch officials should \"request the congressional body to hold its request in abeyance\" until the president decides whether to invoke the privilege. \nPrior to becoming Attorney General in 1991, Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr issued guidance in 1989 about responding to congressional requests for confidential executive branch information. He wrote: \"Only when the accommodation process fails to resolve a dispute and a subpoena is issued does it become necessary for the president to consider asserting executive privilege\".\n\nThe Clinton administration invoked executive privilege on fourteen occasions.\n\nIn 1998, President Bill Clinton became the first president since Nixon to assert executive privilege and lose in court, when a federal judge ruled that Clinton aides could be called to testify in the Lewinsky scandal.\n\nLater, Clinton exercised a form of negotiated executive privilege when he agreed to testify before the grand jury called by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr only after negotiating the terms under which he would appear. Declaring that \"absolutely no one is above the law\", Starr said such a privilege \"must give way\" and evidence \"must be turned over\" to prosecutors if it is relevant to an investigation.\n\nThe Bush administration invoked executive privilege on six occasions.\n\nPresident George W. Bush first asserted executive privilege in December 2001 to deny disclosure of details regarding former Attorney General Janet Reno, the scandal involving Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) misuse of organized crime informants James J. Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, and Justice Department deliberations about President Bill Clinton's fundraising tactics.\n\nBush invoked executive privilege \"in substance\" in refusing to disclose the details of Vice President Dick Cheney's meetings with energy executives, which was not appealed by the GAO. In a separate Supreme Court decision in 2004, however, Justice Anthony Kennedy noted \"Executive privilege is an extraordinary assertion of power 'not to be lightly invoked.'\" \"United States v. Reynolds\", 345 U.S. 1, 7 (1953).\n\nFurther, on June 28, 2007, Bush invoked executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas requesting documents from former presidential counsel Harriet Miers and former political director Sara Taylor, citing that:\n\nThe reason for these distinctions rests upon a bedrock presidential prerogative: for the President to perform his constitutional duties, it is imperative that he receive candid and unfettered advice and that free and open discussions and deliberations occur among his advisors and between those advisors and others within and outside the Executive Branch.\nOn July 9, 2007, Bush again invoked executive privilege to block a congressional subpoena requiring the testimonies of Taylor and Miers. Furthermore, White House Counsel Fred F. Fielding refused to comply with a deadline set by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain its privilege claim, prove that the president personally invoked it, and provide logs of which documents were being withheld. On July 25, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee voted to cite Miers and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten for contempt of Congress.\n\nOn July 13, less than a week after claiming executive privilege for Miers and Taylor, Fielding effectively claimed the privilege again, this time in relation to documents related to the 2004 death of Army Ranger Pat Tillman. In a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Fielding claimed certain papers relating to discussion of the friendly fire shooting \"implicate Executive Branch confidentiality interests\" and would therefore not be turned over to the committee.\n\nOn August 1, 2007, Bush invoked the privilege for the fourth time in little over a month, this time rejecting a subpoena for Karl Rove. The subpoena would have required Rove to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a probe over fired federal prosecutors. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, Fielding claimed that \"Rove, as an immediate presidential advisor, is immune from compelled congressional testimony about matters that arose during his tenure and that relate to his official duties in that capacity.\"\n\nLeahy claimed that President Bush was not involved with the decision to terminate the service of U.S. attorneys. Furthermore, he asserted that the president's executive privilege claims protecting both Bolten and Rove were illegal. The Senator demanded that Bolten, Rove, Sara Taylor, and J. Scott Jennings comply \"immediately\" with their subpoenas. This development paved the way for a Senate panel vote on whether to advance the citations to the full Senate. \"It is obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a cover-up and that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of that same effort\", Leahy concluded.\n\n, Rove still claimed executive privilege to avoid a congressional subpoena. Rove's lawyer wrote that his client is \"constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony.\"\n\nOn June 20, 2012, President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege in order to withhold certain Department of Justice documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious controversy ahead of a United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to produce the documents. Later the same day, the House Committee voted 23–17 along party lines to hold Holder in contempt of Congress over not releasing the documents.\n\nExecutive privilege was also used in a lawsuit stemming from the 2012 implementation of the \"Net Worth Sweep\" against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Obama administration did not disclose roughly 11,000 documents from the plaintiffs in the discovery process as they related to the reasoning behind the 2012 actions.\n\nLeaders of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) testified on February 4, 2009 before the United States House Committee on Financial Services subcommittee. The subject of the hearings was why the SEC had failed to act when Harry Markopolos, a private fraud investigator from Boston, alerted the SEC, detailing his persistent and unsuccessful efforts to get the SEC to investigate Bernard Madoff beginning in 1999. One official claimed executive privilege in declining to answer some questions.\n\nWhile investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed former FBI Director James Comey to testify. Comey was fired several weeks before being subpoenaed but had appeared before the committee once before in March while still serving as director. Less than a week before the scheduled hearing, it was reported that President Trump was considering invoking executive privilege to prevent Comey's testimony. According to attorney Page Pate, it seemed unlikely that executive privilege would be applicable, as Trump had publicly spoken about the encounters in question multiple times.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokesman, released a statement on June 5 stating: \"The president's power to assert executive privilege is very well-established. However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey's scheduled testimony.\"\n\nAlso in June 2017, other officials in the Trump administration, including Dan Coats and Jeff Sessions, declined to describe in congressional hearings conversations they had with President Trump, on the ground that they wanted Trump to have an opportunity to decide whether to invoke executive privilege. According to Robert S. Litt, former general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration, this argument may be legitimate under the presidential communications privilege:\n[T]he privilege belongs to the President, and inferior officers should not take it upon themselves to disclose such communications without express permission from the White House. Certainly that is how these issues were handled in the Obama Administration: when Congress asked an agency for information about presidential communications, as it often did, the agency consulted with the White House to see if there were objections to responding.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress emphasized that they were not seeking classified information, and strongly objected to the rationale given by the Trump administration officials.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, Steve Bannon, the former Trump political adviser, but who was no longer part of the Trump administration, appeared at the House Intelligence Committee under subpoena. According to committee members, he answered only 25 questions that had been pre-approved by the White House, in each to which he answered \"no\", and invoked the president's executive privilege in declining to answer any of the committee questions. Republican and Democratic members of the committee said they were considering seeking contempt of Congress charges.\n\n"}

While he was ordained he taught science at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School (1891–94), and became a lecturer in Theology and fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1913.\n\nAs an Anglican theologian, Tennant assimilated much of Huxley’s lectures culminating in the 1901-1902 Hulsean Lecture entitled \"Origin and Propagation of Sin\" where he integrated evolutionary ideas into a Christian synthesis.\n\nOne of Tennant's goals in his writings was an integrative synthesis of the doctrines of the fall and original sin with Huxley’s claims of conflict between Darwinian thought and Christianity.\n\nTennant believed that the existence of a god was needed to explain the purposive quality of evolution. Tennant was the first theist widely known to put forward such an argument. In volume 2 of his book \"Philosophical Theology\" he says:\n\"The multitude of interwoven adaptations by which the world is constituted a theatre of life, intelligence, and morality, cannot reasonably be regarded as an outcome of mechanism, or of blind formative power, or aught but purposive intelligence.\"\n\nHe was an advocate of theistic evolution. Tennant made an argument from design from the \"quality of the evolution process\".\n\n"}

In the later part of his life, Gadadhara Pandita lived in the Tota Gopinatha Temple.. The local legend around the temple is that the deity of Krishna in the temple sat down to accommodate Pandit Goswami's worship after he had become feeble due to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's departure. Others say that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Pandit Goswami disappeared on the same day inside the Gundicha Temple of Puri, Odisha .\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu personally gave Gadadhara Pandita Goswami the deity to worship, and the responsibility to teach Srimad Bhagavatam. Pandita Goswami's guru was Pundarika Vidyanidhi. Pandita Goswami initiated Bhugarbha Goswami, and Bhugarbha Goswami gave rise to one line of the Gadadhara parivara. The Gadadhara Parivāra (Parivāra means 'family') is one among different traditional Chaitanya lineages that have continued till modern times; the Advaita Parivāra is another example. \n\nBecause Pandita Goswami is Radharani herself, the followers of Pandita Goswami aspire for mādhurya-rasa.

As a charism, the gift is imparted to individuals by the power of the Holy Spirit. The view of Cessationism held that the \"charismata\" were exclusively for Apostolic times, and therefore the gift of miracles ceased with the writing of the last book of the Bible or the death of St. John the Apostle. In Continuationism, on the other hand, the gifts are held to be possible throughout the history of Christianity, and to have occurred since Apostolic times.\n\nIn Catholicism, the gift is one of the extraordinary graces of the Holy Spirit imparted to certain individuals so that Christ's doctrine may become credible and Christians confirmed in their faith. Although miracles are necessarily the work of God, men and angels may be said to work miracles in a threefold way\n\n\nLike other \"charismata\", these are special and extraordinary powers vouchsafed by God only to a few, and primarily for the spiritual good of others rather than of the recipient.\n\nIn Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, it is believed that God continues to operate this gift through believers with the gift of faith. This gift does not, however, make one a miracle worker since it is God who performs the miracle. The emphasis is on \"the power of God operating by the Spirit of God in and through the Church of God\". God always signifies or teaches something with miraculous manifestations.\n\n\n"}

Richard Niebuhr\n\nHelmut Richard Niebuhr (September 3, 1894 – July 5, 1962) is considered one of the most important Christian theological ethicists in 20th century America, most known for his 1951 book \"Christ and Culture\" and his posthumously published book \"The Responsible Self\". The younger brother of theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, Richard Niebuhr taught for several decades at the Yale Divinity School. Both brothers were, in their day, important figures in the neo-orthodox theological school within American Protestantism. His theology (together with that of his colleague at Yale, Hans Wilhelm Frei) has been one of the main sources of postliberal theology, sometimes called the \"Yale school\". He influenced such figures as James Gustafson, Stanley Hauerwas, and Gordon Kaufman.\n\nNiebuhr was born in Wright City, Missouri, the son of Gustav Niebuhr, a minister in the Evangelical Synod of North America. His family moved to Lincoln, Illinois in 1902. He graduated from Elmhurst College in 1912, and Eden Theological Seminary in 1915. He would later obtain a master's degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1918, and his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1924. He started his working career as a reporter in Lincoln, Illinois in 1915 and 1916. He was ordained a minister in the Evangelical Synod in 1916, and served with that body in St. Louis, Missouri, through 1918. (The Synod merged in 1934 with the German Reformed Church in the United States; the subsequently formed Evangelical and Reformed Church united in 1957 with the Congregational Christian Churches to form the United Church of Christ.) While living in St. Louis, he was a member and leader in Evangelical United Church of Christ in Webster Groves, Missouri, and taught at Eden Theological Seminary from 1919 to 1924 and from 1927 to 1931. Between 1924 and 1927, he was the President of Elmhurst College. He taught at Yale from 1931 to 1962, specializing in theology and Christian ethics.\n\nNiebuhr was concerned throughout his life with the absolute sovereignty of God and the issue of historical relativism. He considered Karl Barth and Ernst Troeltsch to be his main influences. He accepted from Barth and neo-orthodoxy the absolute transcendence of God. He believed that God is above history, that he makes commands upon human beings, and that all history is under the control of this God. Niebuhr borrowed often from Paul Tillich's notion of God. He was comfortable describing God as Being-itself, the One, or the Ground of Being. In this regard, Niebuhr held something of a middle ground between the dogmatic, confessional theology of Karl Barth and the philosophically oriented neo-liberalism of Paul Tillich.\n\nNiebuhr was also concerned with historical relativism. While God may be absolute and transcendent, human beings are not. Humans are a part of the flux and movement of the world. Because of this, how God is apprehended is never permanent. God is always understood differently by people at different times in history and in different social locations. Niebuhr's theology shows great sensitivity to how expressions of faith differ from one religious community to another. His thought in some respects anticipated latter-day liberal Protestant concerns about pluralism and tolerance. However, in \"The Kingdom of God in America\" (1937), he also criticized the liberal social gospel, describing its message as, \"A God without wrath brought men without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross.\"\n\nNiebuhr was, by training, a Christian ethicist. In this capacity, his biggest concern was how human beings relate to God, to each other, to their communities, and to the world. Niebuhr's theological ethics can be described as relational. His greatest ethical treatise is \"The Responsible Self\", published shortly after his death. It was intended to be the seed of a much larger book on ethics. His sudden death prevented his writing this work. In \"The Responsible Self\", Niebuhr dealt with human beings as responding agents. Human beings are always \"in response\" to some influence, whether another human being, a community, the natural order or history, or, above all, God.\n\nHis most famous work is \"Christ and Culture.\" It is often referenced in discussions and writings on a Christian's response to the world's culture. In the book, Niebuhr gives a history of how Christianity has responded to culture. He outlines five prevalent viewpoints:\n\n\n\n"}

Born in Berlin, Marcuse studied at the universities of Berlin and then at Freiburg, where he received his PhD. He was a prominent figure in the Frankfurt-based Institute for Social Research – what later became known as the Frankfurt School. He was married to Sophie Wertheim (1924–1951), Inge Neumann (1955–1973), and Erica Sherover (1976–1979). In his written works, he criticized capitalism, modern technology, historical materialism and entertainment culture, arguing that they represent new forms of social control.\n\nBetween 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in US government service for the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) where he criticized the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the book \"\" (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the preeminent theorist of the New Left and the student movements of West Germany, France, and the United States; some consider him the \"father of the New Left\".\n\nHis best known works are \"Eros and Civilization\" (1955) and \"One-Dimensional Man\" (1964). His Marxist scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the United States and internationally. He viewed the integration of Eros and \"Logos\" to be the liberation of society.\n\nHerbert Marcuse was born July 19, 1898, in Berlin, to Carl Marcuse and Gertrud Kreslawsky. His family was Jewish. In 1916 he was drafted into the German Army, but only worked in horse stables in Berlin during World War I. He then became a member of a Soldiers' Council that participated in the aborted socialist Spartacist uprising. He completed his PhD thesis at the University of Freiburg in 1922 on the German \"Künstlerroman\" after which he moved back to Berlin, where he worked in publishing. In 1924 he married Sophie Wertheim, a mathematician. He returned to Freiburg in 1928 to study with Edmund Husserl and write a habilitation with Martin Heidegger, which was published in 1932 as \"Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity\" (\"Hegels Ontologie und die Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit\"). This study was written in the context of the Hegel renaissance that was taking place in Europe with an emphasis on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's ontology of life and history, idealist theory of spirit and dialectic. With his academic career blocked by the rise of the Third Reich, in 1933 Marcuse joined the Institute for Social Research, popularly known as the Frankfurt School, in 1932. He went almost at once into exile with them, first briefly in Geneva, then in the United States. Unlike some others, Marcuse did not return to Germany after the war, and when he visited Frankfurt in 1956, the young Jürgen Habermas was surprised to discover that he was a key member of the Institute.\n\nIn 1933, Marcuse published his first major review, of Karl Marx's \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844\". In this review, Marcuse revised the interpretation of Marxism, from the standpoint of the works of the early Marx.\n\nWhile a member of the Institute of Social Research, Marcuse developed a model for critical social theory, created a theory of the new stage of state and monopoly capitalism, described the relationships between philosophy, social theory, and cultural criticism, and provided an analysis and critique of German fascism. Marcuse worked closely with critical theorists while at the institute.\n\nAfter emigrating from Germany in 1933, Marcuse immigrated to the United States in 1934, where he became a citizen in 1940. Although he never returned to Germany to live, he remained one of the major theorists associated with the Frankfurt School, along with Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno (among others). In 1940 he published \"Reason and Revolution\", a dialectical work studying G. W. F. Hegel and Karl Marx.\n\nDuring World War II, Marcuse first worked for the US Office of War Information (OWI) on anti-Nazi propaganda projects. In 1943, he transferred to the Research and Analysis Branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nDirected by the Harvard historian William L. Langer, the Research and Analysis Branch was in fact the biggest American research institution in the first half of the twentieth century. At its zenith between 1943 and 1945, it comprised over twelve hundred employees, four hundred of whom were stationed abroad. In many respects, it was the site where post–World War II American social science was born, with protégés of some of the most esteemed American university professors, as well as a large contingent of European intellectual émigrés, in its ranks.\n\nThese men comprised the \"theoretical brain trust\" of the American war machine, which, according to its founder, William J. Donovan, would function as a \"final clearinghouse\" for the secret services—that is, as a structure that, although not engaged in determining war strategy or tactics, would be able to assemble, organize, analyze, and filter the immense flow of military information directed toward Washington, thanks to the unique capacity of the specialists on hand to interpret the relevant sources.\n\nIn March 1943, Marcuse joined his fellow Frankfurt School scholar Franz Neumann in R & A's Central European Section as senior analyst and rapidly established himself as \"the leading analyst on Germany.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the OSS in 1945, Marcuse was employed by the US Department of State as head of the Central European section, retiring after the death of his first wife in 1951.\n\nIn 1952, Marcuse began a teaching career as a political theorist, first at Columbia University, then at Harvard University. Marcuse worked at Brandeis University from 1958 to 1965, then at the University of California San Diego until his retirement. It was during his time at Brandeis University that he wrote his most famous work, \"One-Dimensional Man\" (1964).\n\nMarcuse was a friend and collaborator of the political sociologist Barrington Moore Jr. and of the political philosopher Robert Paul Wolff, and also a friend of the Columbia University sociology professor C. Wright Mills, one of the founders of the New Left movement. In his \"Introduction\" to \"One-Dimensional Man\", Marcuse wrote, \"I should like to emphasize the vital importance of the work of C. Wright Mills.\"\n\nIn the post-war period, Marcuse rejected the theory of class struggle and the Marxist concern with labor, instead claiming, according to Leszek Kołakowski, that since \"all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant.\" He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of Jerry Rubin and others.\n\nMarcuse's critiques of capitalist society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and Sigmund Freud, \"Eros and Civilization\", and his 1964 book \"One-Dimensional Man\") resonated with the concerns of the student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests and his essay \"Repressive Tolerance\" (1965), Marcuse soon became known in the media as \"Father of the New Left.\" Contending that the students of the sixties were not waiting for the publication of his work to act, Marcuse brushed the media's branding of him as \"Father of the New Left\" aside lightly, saying \"It would have been better to call me not the father, but the grandfather, of the New Left.\" His work heavily influenced intellectual discourse on popular culture and scholarly popular culture studies. He had many speaking engagements in the US and Western Bloc in the late 1960s and 1970s. He became a close friend and inspirer of the French philosopher André Gorz.\n\nMarcuse defended the arrested East German dissident Rudolf Bahro (author of \"Die Alternative: Zur Kritik des real existierenden Sozialismus\" [trans., \"The Alternative in Eastern Europe\"]), discussing in a 1979 essay Bahro's theories of \"change from within.\"\n\nMany radical scholars and activists were influenced by Marcuse, such as Norman O. Brown, Angela Davis, Captain Charles J. Moore, Kathy Acker, Abbie Hoffman, Rudi Dutschke, and Robert M. Young. (See the List of Scholars and Activists link, below.) Among those who critiqued him from the left were Marxist-humanist Raya Dunayevskaya, fellow German emigre Paul Mattick, both of whom subjected \"One-Dimensional Man\" to a Marxist critique, and Noam Chomsky, who knew and liked Marcuse \"but thought very little of his work.\" Marcuse's 1965 essay \"Repressive Tolerance\", in which he claimed capitalist democracies can have totalitarian aspects, has been criticized by conservatives. Marcuse argues that genuine tolerance does not permit support for \"repression\", since doing so ensures that marginalized voices will remain unheard. He characterizes tolerance of repressive speech as \"inauthentic\". Instead, he advocates a form of tolerance that is intolerant of repressive (namely right-wing) political movements:\n\nMarcuse later expressed his radical ideas through three pieces of writing. He wrote \"An Essay on Liberation\" in 1969, in which he celebrated liberation movements such as those in Vietnam, which inspired many radicals. In 1972 he wrote \"Counterrevolution and Revolt\", which argues that the hopes of the 1960s were facing a counterrevolution from the right.\n\nAfter Brandeis denied the renewal of his teaching contract in 1965, Marcuse taught at the University of California San Diego until his retirement and devoted the rest of his life to teaching, writing and giving lectures around the world. His efforts brought him attention from the media, which claimed that he openly advocated violence, although he often clarified that only \"violence of defense\" could be appropriate, not \"violence of aggression\". He continued to promote Marxian theory, with some of his students helping to spread his ideas. He published his final work \"The Aesthetic Dimension\" in 1979 on the role of art in the process of what he termed \"emancipation\" from bourgeois society.\n\nMarcuse married three times. His first wife was mathematician Sophie Wertheim (1901–1951), with whom he had a son, Peter (born 1928). Herbert's second marriage was to Inge Neumann (1910–1973), the widow of his close friend Franz Neumann (1900–1954). His third wife was Erica Sherover (1938–1988), a former graduate student and forty years his junior, whom he married in 1976. His son Peter Marcuse is professor emeritus of urban planning at Columbia University. His granddaughter is the novelist Irene Marcuse and his grandson, Harold Marcuse, is a professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nOn July 29, 1979, ten days after his eighty-first birthday, Marcuse died after suffering a stroke during a visit to Germany. He had spoken at the Frankfurt \"Römerberggespräche\", and was on his way to the Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World in Starnberg, on invitation from second-generation Frankfurt School theorist Jürgen Habermas. In 2003, after his ashes were rediscovered in the United States, they were buried in the Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery in Berlin.\n\nMarcuse's famous concept repressive desublimation refers to his argument that postwar mass culture, with its profusion of sexual provocations, serves to reinforce political repression. If people are preoccupied with inauthentic sexual stimulation, their political energy will be \"desublimated\"; instead of acting constructively to change the world, they remain repressed and uncritical. Marcuse advanced the prewar thinking of critical theory toward a critical account of the \"one-dimensional\" nature of bourgeois life in Europe and America. His thinking could, therefore, also be considered an advance of the concerns of earlier liberal critics such as David Riesman.\n\nMuch of Marcuse's philosophy was centered around the belief that Eros had to integrate with \"Logos\" in order to strive. Marcuse defended Plato's argument that while Eros was constructive, \"Logos\" was superior and would eventually absorb it. In \"One Dimensional Man\", he argued that \"Logos\" would also liberate's one's gratification.\n\nTwo aspects of Marcuse's work are of particular importance, first, his use of language more familiar from the critique of Soviet or Nazi regimes to characterize developments in the advanced industrial world; and second, his grounding of critical theory in a particular use of psychoanalytic thought. Both of these features of his thinking have often been misunderstood and have given rise to critiques of his work that miss the point of his targets.\n\nDuring his years in Freiburg, Marcuse wrote a series of essays that explored the possibility of synthesizing Marxism and Heidegger's fundamental ontology, as begun in the latter's work \"Being and Time\" (1927). This early interest in Heidegger followed Marcuse's demand for \"concrete philosophy,\" which, he declared in 1928, \"concerns itself with the truth of contemporaneous human existence.\" These words were directed against the neo-Kantianism of the mainstream, and against both the revisionist and orthodox Marxist alternatives, in which the subjectivity of the individual played little role. Though Marcuse quickly distanced himself from Heidegger following Heidegger's endorsement of Nazism, it has been suggested by thinkers such as Jürgen Habermas that an understanding of Marcuse's later thinking demands an appreciation of his early Heideggerian influence.\n\nMarcuse's analysis of capitalism derives partially from one of Karl Marx's main concepts: Objectification, which under capitalism becomes Alienation. Marx believed that capitalism was exploiting humans; that by producing objects of a certain character, laborers became alienated and this ultimately dehumanized them into functional objects themselves. Marcuse took this belief and expanded it. He argued that capitalism and industrialization pushed laborers so hard that they began to see themselves as extensions of the objects they were producing. At the beginning of \"One-Dimensional Man\" Marcuse writes, \"The people recognize themselves in their commodities; they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment,\" meaning that under capitalism (in consumer society) humans become extensions of the commodities that they buy, thus making commodities extensions of people's minds and bodies. Affluent mass technological societies, he argues, are totally controlled and manipulated. In societies based upon mass production and mass distribution, the individual worker has become merely a consumer of its commodities and entire commodified way of life. Modern Capitalism has created false needs and false consciousness geared to consumption of commodities: it locks one-dimensional man into the one-dimensional society which produced the need for people to recognize themselves in their commodities.\n\nThe very mechanism that ties the individual to his society has changed and social control is anchored in the new needs which it has produced. Most important of all, the pressure of consumerism has led to the total integration of the working class into the capitalist system. Its political parties and trade unions have become thoroughly bureaucratized and the power of negative thinking or critical reflection has rapidly declined. The working class is no longer a potentially subversive force capable of bringing about revolutionary change. As a result, rather than looking to the workers as the revolutionary vanguard, Marcuse put his faith in an alliance between radical intellectuals and those groups not yet integrated into one-dimensional society, the socially marginalized, the substratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and persecuted of other ethnicities and other colors, the unemployed and the unemployable. These were the people whose standards of living demanded the ending of intolerable conditions and institutions and whose resistance to one-dimensional society would not be diverted by the system. Their opposition was revolutionary even if their consciousness was not.\n\nLeszek Kołakowski described Marcuse's views as essentially anti-Marxist, in that they ignored Marx's critique of Hegel and discarded the historical theory of class struggle entirely in favor of an inverted Freudian reading of human history where all social rules could and should be discarded to create a \"New World of Happiness.\" Kołakowski concluded that Marcuse's ideal society \"is to be ruled despotically by an enlightened group [who] have realized in themselves the unity of \"Logos\" and Eros, and thrown off the vexatious authority of logic, mathematics, and the empirical sciences.\"\n\nThe philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre asserted that almost all of Marcuse's key positions are false and that his generalizations were based upon the total absence of any account of contemporary social structure. Featherstone criticized his portrayal of modern consumerism: it falsely assumed that consumers were completely passive, uncritically responding to corporate advertising.\n\nHerbert Marcuse appealed to students of the New Left through his emphasis on the power of critical thought and his vision of total human emancipation and a non-repressive civilization. He supported students he felt were subject to the pressures of a commodifying system, and has been regarded as an inspirational intellectual leader. He is also considered among the most influential of the Frankfurt School critical theorists on North American culture, due to his studies on student and counter-cultural movements on the 1960s. The legacy of the 1960s, of which Marcuse was a vital part, lives on, and the Great Refusal is still practiced by oppositional groups and individuals who refuse to conform to the existing systems of oppression and domination.\n\nWolf von Laer, in a podcast titled \"Campus Speech and the Libertarian Student Movement\", cites the influence of Marcuse as an unacknowledged source for the disruptive tactics of the \"New Left\" on today's campuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most recently, he has focused his research on the value structure of economic theory and its consequences for global civil and environmental life. McMurtry was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) in June 2001 by his peers for his outstanding contributions to the study of humanities and social sciences.\n\nMcMurtry's principal research project in Philosophy spanning over seven years has followed from the invitation by the Secretariat of UNESCO/Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS, Paris-Oxford) to construct, author and edit \"Philosophy and World Problems\" as a multi-volume study of world philosophy. Three sub-volumes entitled \"Western Philosophy and the Life-Ground\", \"Modes of Reason\", and \"Philosophy, Human Nature and Society\" have been written with internationally distinguished philosophers contributing to five topic areas in each of these general fields.\n\nThe central title study by McMurtry, entitled, \"What is Good, What is Bad? The Value of All Values Across Time, Place and Theories\", is an encompassing in-depth critical study of known world philosophies and fields to explain the inner logic of each canon and school in relationship to world problems across languages and eras including the method of life-value onto-axiology which is deployed to excavate, explain and resolve life-blind presuppositions of the world's major thought-systems from the ancients East and West to modern and contemporary philosophy.\n\nJohn McMurtry received his doctorate from University College, London in the United Kingdom after completing his BA and MA at the University of Toronto, Canada where he also joined the Zeta Psi fraternity. Prior to doctoral studies, he was \"a professional football player, print and television journalist, academic English teacher and world-traveller\". In his autobiographic article \"The Human Vocation: An Autobiography of Higher Education\" for the scholarly journal Nordicum-Mediterraneum, McMurtry recounts the most salient moments of his formative years and states that he \"came to philosophy as a last resort, because as someone naturally disposed to question unexamined assumptions and conventional beliefs, I could find no other profession which permitted this vocation at the appropriate level of research.\"\n\nValue theory is his unifying field of research, as he has published and taught in as diverse fields of inquiry as social and political philosophy, Asian/Indian and Chinese philosophy, philosophy of economics, philosophy of education, philosophy and literature, philosophy of history, post-Kant continental philosophy, the logic of natural language, and philosophy of the environment.\n\nHe is also part of the peace movement and international law study bodies. He served as Chair of Jurists, War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Tribunal at the Alternative World Summit in Toronto, 1989. His professional work has been published in over 150 books and journals, including Inquiry, the Monist, the Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Praxis International, the Encyclopaedia of Ethics, Atlantic Monthly, Guardian Weekly, and the Norton Anthology of Prose.\n\nMcMurtry's recent research has focused on the underlying value structure of economic theory, its consequences for global civil and environmental life, and the life ground and civil commons. McMurtry considers the global free market \"inefficient and life-destructive\" in proportion to how unregulated it is by life needs (that without which life capacity is reduced) and by life capital (human and ecological life wealth that reproduces more life wealth if not run down). In general, four principles of analysis and development are applied: the life-ground (all the conditions required to take one's next breath), life value (whatever enables life capacities), life capital (means of life that can produce more means of life without loss and cumulative gain), and civil commons (any social construct that enables universal access of community members to life goods through time).\n\nIn \"Unequal Freedoms: The Global Market As An Ethical System\", 1998, he examines the underlying value system of the global market and claims that it constructs the opposite of the \"free and democratic society\" it claims to bring about.\n\nIn \"The Cancer Stage of Capitalism\", 1999, he claims a propensity of human societies to assume the social order in which they live as good however life-destructive they may be, focusing on financial capitalism as displaying the hallmark characteristics of a cancer invasion at the social level of life organization. He conceives \"the civil commons\" as a social immune system.\n\nIn \"Value Wars: The Global Market Versus the Life Economy\", 2002, he criticizes capitalist scientific technology, transnational trade apparatuses, NATO wars, and an expanding prison regime as symptoms of a \"new totalitarianism cumulatively occupying the world and propelling civil and ecological breakdowns\", and proposes constitutional standards of a \"life economy\".\n\nMcMurtry has previously supported 9/11 conspiracy theories to explain the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In one lecture, he drew comparisons to the event of the Reichstag fire and argued that the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) has been lobbied for and exploited by multinational corporations. In a 2015 article on Globalresearch.ca, he advocates that the World Trade Center Towers could have only been brought down via a controlled demolition.\n\n\n"}

He is also a notable proponent of analytical Marxism, and a critic of neoclassical economics and public choice theory, largely on behavioral and psychological grounds.\n\nIn 2016, he was awarded the 22nd Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science for his contributions to political science.\n\nElster earned his PhD in 1972 from the Paris Descartes University in Paris with a dissertation on Karl Marx under the direction of Raymond Aron. Elster was a member of the September Group for many years but left in the early 1990s. Elster previously taught at the University of Oslo in the department of history and held an endowed chair at the University of Chicago, teaching in the departments of philosophy and political science. He is now Robert K. Merton Professor of Social Sciences with appointments in Political Science and Philosophy at Columbia University and \"professeur honoraire\" at the Collège de France. He was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize in 1997 and the Skytte Prize in Political Science in 2016.\n\nHe is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the American Philosophical Society, of the Academia Europaea, and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy.\n\nHe is the son of journalist/author and CEO of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation Torolf Elster and poet Magli Elster.\n\nElster is doctor honoris causa at the universities of Valencia, Stockholm, Trondheim, Louvain-la-Neuve, Torcuato di Tella, and the National University of Colombia. He is honorary professor at the University of Chongqing.\n\nMuch of Elster's writing is characterized by attempts to use analytical theories, especially rational choice theory, as a springboard for philosophical and ethical analysis, with numerous examples from literature and history. \"Elster has made important contributions to several fields,\" Daniel Little wrote in a review essay. \"The breadth and depth of his writings are striking in a time of high specialisation; he is read and discussed by political scientists,legal scholars, economists and philosophers. His work is difficult to summarise in a slogan, but ... it is generally informed by a broad and deep acquaintance with relevant literature in economics, political science, history, philosophy, and psychology.\"\n\nA student of the philosophy of social science (a topic he investigated through case studies in \"Explaining Technical Change\"), Elster strongly argued that social scientific explanations had to be built on top of methodological individualism (the belief that only individuals, not larger entities like \"organizations\" or \"societies\", can actually do things) and microfoundations (explaining big societal changes in terms of individual actions). He criticized Marxists and other social scientists for believing in functionalism (the belief that institutions exist because of their effect on society) and instead tried to give Marxism a foundation in game theory (the economic notion that people make choices based on the expected benefits and the choices others are likely to make).\n\nElster wrote numerous books attempting to use rational choice theory for a wide variety of social explanations. \"Rational choice theory is far more than a technical tool for explaining behaviour,\" he once wrote. \"It is also, and very importantly, a way of coming to grips with ourselves - not only what we should do, but even what we should be.\" He attempted to apply it to topics as varied as politics (\"Political Psychology\"), bias and constrained preferences (\"Sour Grapes\"), emotions (\"Alchemies of the Mind\"), self-restraint (\"Ulysses and the Sirens\", which was selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon), Marxism (\"Making Sense of Marx\"), and more.\n\nIn doing so, he elucidated many issues with simplistic notions of rational choice: endogenous preference formation (certain actions today can change preferences tomorrow, so how does one decide which preferences one prefers?), framing (people express different preferences when the same question is asked different ways), imperfect rationality (weakness of the will, emotion, impulsiveness, habit, self-deception) and our adjustments for it, and time preferences, among others.\n\nAs time went on Elster began to sour on rational choice. A 1991 review in the \"London Review of Books\" noted \"Elster has lost his bearings, or at least his faith. [His latest books], he says, 'reflects an increasing disillusion with the power of reason'.\" His magisterial 500-page book \"Explaining Social Behavior\" includes something of a recantation:\n\nThe book discusses both rational behavior, but also irrational behavior, which Elster says is \"widespread and frequent [but] not inevitable ... we \"want\" to be rational\". In a recent book, \"Le désintéressement\" (part of a two-volume \"Traité critique de l’homme économique\") explores the ramifications of these insights for the possibility of disinterested action.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44080018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44080018", "title": "Karma in Tibetan Buddhism", "text": "Karma in Tibetan Buddhism\n\nKarma in Tibetan Buddhism is one of the central issues addressed in Eastern philosophy, and an important part of its general practice.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, karma is created by physical actions, speech, and even thoughts. There is no concept of good nor bad karma—simply karma. Tibetan Buddhism teaches that every creature has transmigrated helplessly since beginningless time under the influence of ignorance and that their lack of understanding has led to performance of actions that have created connections with cyclic existence. To break this pattern, one must reorient their thinking to accord with reality. Tibetan Buddhism draws on the current human intellect for problem solving as opposed to a higher deity or power.\n\nKarma literally means \"action,\" but it refers to action in a comprehensive way that includes thoughts, words, and deeds. Furthermore, it includes all the effects of these various kinds of action, both the immediate and visible effects and the long-term and invisible effects. Karma is the force that connects all the moments of life to each other and all things to each other.\n\nIn terms of a person's own motivations and aspirations, the issue of others' karmic results is scarcely relevant. The importance is his or her own intention. Karma is a dependent entity-—one whose forces are a direct result of one’s thoughts, actions, and words. According to Tibetan Buddhism, the Buddha taught that one’s present life is only one in a beginningless series of incarnations, and each of these is determined by one’s actions in previous lives. Tibetan Buddhist philosophy believes that we are born again after we die, and subsequently, the karma we create in past lives is carried into our next. The Tibetan Buddhist concept of karma is similar to Newton’s Third Law of Motion, which holds that for every action there is a concordant reaction. This is presented as a universal law that has nothing to do with abstract ideas of justice, reward, or punishment. Karma, whether one is aware of it or not, is constantly being created. Tibetan Buddhism teaches that karma can have immediate reactions, or reactions may come later in life, in a future life, or in the bardo interval between lives, which creates the basis for the form in which the next life will take. By understanding the ball-and-chain relationship between karma and the individual, one can better understand Tibetan Buddhism as a whole.\n\nTsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, argued that the Prāsaṅgika position allowed for the postulation of something called an \"act's cessation\" (\"las zhig pal\") which persists and is in fact a substance (\"rdzas\" or \"dngos po\", S. \"vastu\"), and which explains the connection between cause and result. Gorampa, an important philosopher of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, accused Tsongkhapa of a doctrinal innovation not legitimately grounded in Candrakīrti's work, and one which amounted to little more than a (non-Buddhist) Vaiśeṣika concept. Gelugpa scholars offered defenses of the idea.\n\nIn the Nyingma school, the teaching of karma is the third of four thoughts that turn the mind to dharma in the outer preliminaries. It is taught within the pre-liminary practices of the \"Longchen Nyingthig\", \"The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse\". This is a \"terma\" or \"spiritual discovery\", a hidden teaching from Padmasambhava which was revealed by Jigme Lingpa (1729-1798). It is one of the most widely practiced teachings in the Nyingmapa school. \"The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse\" teaching cycle has the following structure:\n\nIn Jigme Lingpa's \"Mindfulness Application: Unique Great Perfection Preliminary Instructions\", karma arises to produce samsara, which should be abandoned. All the ten virtues and non-virtues will give results similar to the cause and can proliferate. With this understand, cultivating a stable mind can avoid non-virtuous acts and appreciation for virtuous acts.\n\nPatrul Rinpoche wrote down Jigme Lingpa's pre-liminary practices from his teacher Jikmé Gyalwé Nyugu. These were translated into a book called \"The Words of My Perfect Teacher\". It describes ten negative actions which are to be avoided, and positive actions to be adopted. According to Patrul Rinpoche, each negative act produces four kinds of karmic effects:\n\nKhenpo Ngawang Pelzang, a qualified Longchen Nyingthig commentator, explained harmful karma’s remedy is to first meet the spiritual friend, then listen to teachings and reflect on them. When karmic obstacles arise, the student may generate confidence in karmic laws; regret past actions and the student may apply other appropriate remedies. Continuing harmful karma may lead to lower rebirth. Lessening past results with meritorious activity results in higher rebirths. Students achieving pure karma will be welcomed to go directly to liberation in any instant. Since harmful actions are rooted in negative emotions and these are rooted in the self belief, some realize no-self to believe and then end both karma and the emotions. Students may then attain the Arhat’s nirvana result, with and without residue, similar to the no more learning path. Bodhisattvas may pray for all karma to ripen upon them to purify its effect most beneficially for the student. \n\nChagdud Tulku Rinpoche’s student Jane Tromge compiled his Dudjom Tersar Ngondro teachings from Dudjom Lingpa’s terma revelation. Karma weaves experienced patterns as the inevitable results from out flowing causes. Understanding karma and purifications can establish a spiritual compass to direct conduct in positive accord until enlightenment’s threshold. An enlightened Buddha has passed beyond karmic dualism to an infinite reflecting radiance awakening. Karma is created in the mind source, with speech and body following the mind’s lead. Buddhist ten non-virtues and ten virtues delineate what to abandon and accept. Proliferating virtuous actions carries repetitions forward into future lifetimes.\n\nDzonsar Jamyag Khentse’s Longchen Nyingthig commentary explains that forgetting about death and karma is shown when we complain about everyone else. The sutras say Mara's third arrow is directed to those with wrong views, such as not believing in cause condition and effect (karma). Protection may be achieved with discipline, meditation and wisdom. Exhausting karma leads to enlightenment and it's impossible to be independent and in control of anything having so many causes. Scientific people may believe in karma and not in reincarnation as its effects from virtute and non-virtue. This may corrode the ultimate truth beliefs in an interdependent reality, shunyata, and the triple gem, which request Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to not pass into Parinirvana. Karma is synonymous with reincarnation. Karmic debts pass from each lifetime. Merit produces good karma. \n\nKhenpo Tenzin Norgay's Nam Cho Ngöndro (preliminary practice) teachings emphasize karma purification importance in relation to proceeding to Dzogchen practices. There are 10 Steps in Ngöndro to quick enlightenment and karma is at Step 3. Karma follows the mind's wandering in samsara and may propel to the six realms. Only the student can purge and manage conduct and outcomes. Advancing to Dzogchen and skipping Ngöndro practices could lead to wrong karma views, where avoiding karma causes dangerous nihilistic (bodhicitta voided) views, the antidotes may become poisons. For example, the Heart Sutra, which explains no suffering, no cause of suffering, no path and no fruition could lead to a paradox asking why even practice. Understanding karma in the Ngöndro context helps answer the paradox. Karma is in the foundation for all buddhist practices and requires both logic and faith for acceptance. Karma necessitates accepting beyond what the senses can materially perceive. Karmic law is not legislated, it is buddha nature and unavoidable. It is a way of expressing how the mind functions and can be trained. The Abhidharma explains karma in detail as karma is seen in the four noble truths. Dharma works out in nondiscrimination for everyone when there are shared karmic beliefs. \n\nKhenpo Tsultrim Lodro interprets karma to mean cause, whenever karma is committed the seed will be planted in the alaya consciousness and the effect ripens. There are four types of ripening; the first ripes in this lifetime. While, the other three types may ripen in the next lifetime. Infailabe karma, a weak cause may encounter a strong antidote and causality may be broken. Immutable karma and mutable karma may have indefinite fruition. Virtuous karma can ripen slowly, and it's possible when undergoing suffering. Some illness result from previous lives. The Abhidharma-kosha-shastra clearly explains the workings of cause and effect. According to the Mahayanabhiddharma-sangiti-shastra, repenting from beginningless time and vowing to never commit evil again mutes evil karma which is suffering's cause. With Merit dedication the seed of happiness it planted and may save virtuous karma and prevent it from becoming mutable. Children may inherit their parents' karma. From the relative truth perspective, when there is cause there is an effect. \n\nIn the Vajrayana tradition, negative past karma may be \"purified\" through such practices as meditation on Vajrasattva because they both are the mind's psychological phenomenon. The performer of the action, after having purified the karma, does not experience the negative results he or she otherwise would have. Engaging in the ten negative actions out of selfishness and delusions hurts all involved. Otherwise, loving others, receives love; whereas; people with closed hearts may be prevented from happiness. One good thing about karma is that it can be purified through confession, if the thoughts become positive. Within Guru Yoga seven branch offerings practice, confession is the antidote to aversion.\n\nThubten Zopa Rinpoche explains that purification entails applying the four powers, where each action has four aspects that determine if the action is complete or incomplete. These aspects are: motivation, object, performance and completion. If an action is complete in all four aspects, this is throwing karma and can determine throwing rebirth into the six realms; or, if beneficial with good karma to better rebirth. A missing aspect becomes completed karma, thus determining future life quality and a completed negative action keeps suffering ongoing. The first of the four purification powers is taking refuge and generating bodhicitta, the second is release to counteract the results similar to the cause, the third is remedy with applying antidotes to throwing karma and the fourth is indestructible determination by overcoming tendency to habitually create negativities over and over again. This logic is common to all Vajrayana practices. Realizing emptiness is the ultimate purification. The four powers are confessional and are different than Christian confessionals; however parallels exist. Each action leaves an imprint to ripen as positive for happiness or negative for suffering. Proper application requires a qualified lama to guide the process with view, reading the method alone may be insufficient. \n\nThe Tibetan Book of the Dead contains elaborate karma purification practices to naturally liberate cyclic rebirth action. This includes natural liberation practice with the mind; with the spiritual teacher; with naked perception; with homage to sacred enlighten families for habitual tendencies; with confessional acts, with death signs visual recognition; with death ritual deception for fear; with recollection for consciousness transference; fundamentally with hearing great liberation; and with wearing through the psycho-physical aggregates. Confessional acts in this context is important for purification (without renunciation) where the four powers are 1)reliance with one hundred peaceful and wrathful deities visualization, 2)actual antidote with elaborate confessional acts natural liberation practice and Vajrasattva mantra, 3)remorse, negative acts genuine recollection, and 4) resolving to never commit such negative actions again. \n\n\n"}

As a boy, Radványi attended a grammar school on Marko Street in Budapest. While attending grammar school, at the age of 16, he authored a book of poetry, which received a preface from Frigyes Karinthy. Radványi studied economics and philosophy at the University of Budapest from 1918 to 1919, where he became involved in radical politics. With the destruction of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919 he fled to Vienna, where he adopted the pseudonym \"Johann \", from the 18th-century Protestant dissident theologian. Radványi studied philosophy in Germany at Heidelberg University, where he obtained his doctorate in 1923. Directed by Karl Jaspers, his thesis on Chiliasm was 'summa cum laude'. While at Heidelberg, Radványi met the poet Anna Seghers. They married in 1925 and had two children, (b. 1926) and Ruth (b. 1928).\n\nAfter finishing their studies at Heidelberg, Radvanyi and Seghers moved to Berlin, where Radvanyi directed the Marxistische Arbeiterschule (Marxist Workers School) from 1925 to 1933. Radványi gathered faculty members such as Georg Lukács and Bertolt Brecht, and speakers such as Albert Einstein, who in 1931 hosted a conference titled \"What a worker must know about the Theory of Relativity\". László indicated in his letters in 1926 the impossibility of obtaining a job as a philosophy professor in Germany because of his \"Hungarian-ness and Jewishness\". The German government closed the Marxistische Arbeiterschule in 1933, and Radványi then left for Paris. In Paris, Radványi founded and directed the Freie Deutsche Hochschule (Free German University), however, the German invasion of Paris forced Radványi to abandon his new endeavour. In 1940, the police in Meudon detained him as a citizen of a country allied with Germany. In December 1940, Seghers obtained a visa for herself, her husband, and their children with the help of Karl Mannheim. The family did not leave France until March 24, 1941, after they had received a transit visa from the United States; they arrived in New York on June 16, 1941. They departed June 25, 1941, aboard the SS Monterrey. The SS Monterey's manifest of passengers also included the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss and surrealistic writer André Breton for New York City and the port of Veracruz, in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nRadványi and his family arrived in Mexico on June 30, 1941. In Mexico City, the family had an audience in the National Palace with the new president, General Manuel Ávila Camacho. Radványi got a job at a local newspaper. Vicente Lombardo Toledano, the leader of the Mexican labor movement, asked Radványi to join the recently created Universidad Obrera de México (Workers' University of Mexico) and teach Marxist history and economics. In 1944, Radványi took a position at the National University of Mexico. Radványi left Mexico in 1952 for the German Democratic Republic where he taught at Humboldt University of Berlin.

The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky and others in the 1980s. As Moravec writes, \"it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility\".\n\nSimilarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are \"unconscious\". \"In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best\", he wrote, and added \"we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly\".\n\nOne possible explanation of the paradox, offered by Moravec, is based on evolution. All human skills are implemented biologically, using machinery designed by the process of natural selection. In the course of their evolution, natural selection has tended to preserve design improvements and optimizations. The older a skill is, the more time natural selection has had to improve the design. Abstract thought developed only very recently, and consequently, we should not expect its implementation to be particularly efficient.\n\nAs Moravec writes:\nA compact way to express this argument would be:\n\nSome examples of skills that have been evolving for millions of years: recognizing a face, moving around in space, judging people’s motivations, catching a ball, recognizing a voice, setting appropriate goals, paying attention to things that are interesting; anything to do with perception, attention, visualization, motor skills, social skills and so on.\n\nSome examples of skills that have appeared more recently: mathematics, engineering, human games, logic and scientific reasoning. These are hard for us because they are not what our bodies and brains were primarily evolved to do. These are skills and techniques that were acquired recently, in historical time, and have had at most a few thousand years to be refined, mostly by cultural evolution.\n\nIn the early days of artificial intelligence research, leading researchers often predicted that they would be able to create thinking machines in just a few decades (see history of artificial intelligence). Their optimism stemmed in part from the fact that they had been successful at writing programs that used logic, solved algebra and geometry problems and played games like checkers and chess. Logic and algebra are difficult for people and are considered a sign of intelligence. They assumed that, having (almost) solved the \"hard\" problems, the \"easy\" problems of vision and commonsense reasoning would soon fall into place. They were wrong, and one reason is that these problems are not easy at all, but incredibly difficult. The fact that they had solved problems like logic and algebra was irrelevant, because these problems are extremely easy for machines to solve.\n\nRodney Brooks explains that, according to early AI research, intelligence was \"best characterized as the things that highly educated male scientists found challenging\", such as chess, symbolic integration, proving mathematical theorems and solving complicated word algebra problems. \"The things that children of four or five years could do effortlessly, such as visually distinguishing between a coffee cup and a chair, or walking around on two legs, or finding their way from their bedroom to the living room were not thought of as activities requiring intelligence.\"\n\nThis would lead Brooks to pursue a new direction in artificial intelligence and robotics research. He decided to build intelligent machines that had \"No cognition. Just sensing and action. That is all I would build and completely leave out what traditionally was thought of as the \"intelligence\" of artificial intelligence.\" This new direction, which he called \"Nouvelle AI\" was highly influential on robotics research and AI.\n\nLinguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker considers this the main lesson uncovered by AI researchers. In his book \"The Language Instinct\", he writes:\n\n\n\n"}

He exchanged several letters on the subject with Albert Einstein. In 1953 he published a book in Hebrew entitled \"Ma'ada Ha'Cosmos vey Hevrat Ha'Mada\" (\"Cosmic Science and the Scientific Society\") which became the foundation of his eventual cosmotheistic formulation. Moshe Sharett, soon to be Israel's second Prime Minister, was so impressed by the book that he shared it with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. As a result, Nessyahu was appointed Director of the Research Department of the Israeli Labor Party. Nessyahu remained in this position until his death.\n\nIn 1968 he met Tsvi Bisk, a new immigrant from the United States, who became his assistant at the Research Department. This meeting triggered a renewed interest in cosmotheism with Bisk as his collaborator and translator. Numerous English-language drafts of the idea were produced over the years and sent to hundreds of thinkers around the world to solicit their opinions. The year he died Nessyahu finally published his work in book form in Hebrew.\n\nThe cosmotheistic hypothesis stipulates that the Big Bang that created our cosmos was a local event in an infinite universe — a universe that contains an infinite number of cosmoi (what is now being speculated by theoretical physicists as the multiverse). It proposes that this cosmos is an evolutionary entity, in a constant state of ever growing complexity — that eventually has produced conscious life. It posits that due to the evolutionary nature of cosmic development, now being revealed by the \"new physics\" and \"new cosmology\", it is statistically certain that huge numbers of conscious life-forms (equivalent in self-awareness to human beings) have arisen throughout the cosmos; as if conscious life has been sown (as a cosmic genome) throughout the cosmos by the very process of cosmic evolution.\n\nNessyahu postulated that a number of these conscious life-forms will conclude that they must strive to become part of the God-ing of the cosmos. The expansion of conscious life throughout the cosmos will eventually be unfettered by its physical limitations and ultimately conscious life will fill the entire cosmos; it will become co-eval with a cosmos that has dissolved into pure radiation as an inevitable consequence of entropy. Thus the cosmos will become in its entirety a conscious universal being — i.e., the cosmos will have become God. Cosmotheism posits God as the consequence of the cosmos and not as its cause. Not in the beginning God created the cosmos but in the end the evolutionary cosmos will have created God.\n\nSince several racist groups co-opted the name \"cosmotheism\", Nessyahu's living colleague Tsvi Bisk decided to rename Nessyahu's hypothesis \"cosmodeism\", a name closer to the tradition of natural theology which cosmodeism best reflects. Bisk is presently writing a book entitled \"Cosmodeism: A Worldview for the Space Age.\"\n\n\"(all in Hebrew)\"\n\n"}

On 5 January 2011, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments proclaimed her Patroness of the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia and designated the feast of the image Saturday preceding the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time with the permission to celebrate it also on Sunday.\nThe original image is derived from an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel brought to Al Ahmadi, Kuwait on 1 May 1948. On the Feast of the Immaculate Conception 1948, the priest, Father Teofano Ubaldo Stella of the Carmelite Order had it framed and brought out for veneration. In 1949, the Legion of Mary used their own image of Miraculous Medal, which encouraged Father Stella to commission an image in Italy under the sculpting company \"Rosa and Zanzio Ditta\" to carve a statue of the Madonna and Child using a cedar of Lebanon. The image was brought to Pope Pius XII who also venerated the image and authorised its Marian title.\n\nOn Orthodox Christmas, 6 January 1950, the statue was returned to Kuwait for public veneration by the faithful.\n\nIn 1954, Kuwaiti soldiers travelled to Rome for the hundredth anniversary of the Dogma the Immaculate Conception, and presented another replica of the image at the Parish of Saint Teresa in Rome. On 16 September 1954, the same image was brought to Pope Pius XII, who blessed the statue at Castel Gandolfo. In May 1956, Pius XII sent a special candle to the new parish built in Ahmadi, especially chosen by him from that year's Candlemas ceremonies in Rome.\nIn 1956, Bishop Stella petitioned the Holy See to proclaim the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Arabia as Patroness of Kuwait. Pope Pius XII granted his consent via the Papal bull \"Regnum Mariae\" on 25 January 1957. A solid gold crown studded with precious rubies and diamonds was crafted and then brought to Rome, where Pope John XXIII personally blessed it on 17 March 1960. Bishop Stella donated a particular pearl to the crown as well.\n\nThe Canonical coronation was further authorised by Pope John XXIII, which occurred on 25 March 1960 via the Papal legate Cardinal Valerian Gracias of Bombay. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI approved the patronage by assigning the Marian title was the principal patroness for the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia.\n\n\nIn the 25th January 1957 decree \"Regnum Mariae\", Pope Pius XII, declared Our Lady of Arabia the Principal Patron of the territory and the Vicariate Apostolic of Kuwait.\n\nPope Benedict XVI approved her title as Patroness for the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Arabia on 5 January 2011.\n"}

He contributed significantly to work on the indigenous languages of the Americas, as well as advancing the understanding of written Chinese.\n\nDu Ponceau's fondness for languages began at age six. He studied at a Benedictine college until he abruptly ended his education after only 18 months over a dissatisfaction with the scholarly philosophy taught there. He emigrated to America in 1777, at age 17, with Baron von Steuben, who was 30 years his senior.\n\nDu Ponceau served as a secretary to Steuben in the Continental Army during the American Revolution.

Reneker Distinguished Service Professor of Music at the University of Chicago. His lifelong interest in 19th-century Italian opera began with listening to Metropolitan Opera broadcasts in his youth. \"Divas and Scholars: Performing Italian Opera\", a major work on the subject, won the Otto Kinkeldey Award of the American Musicological Society as best book on music of 2006.\n\nPhilip Gossett's contributions to opera scholarship and how they can influence operatic performance may best be summed up by \"Newsday\"'s comment that \"some encomiasts claim that soprano Maria Callas did as much for Italian opera as Arturo Toscanini or Verdi. Musicologist Philip Gossett arguably has done as much for Italian opera as any of those geniuses.\"\n\nGossett earned degrees from the Juilliard School, Amherst College, and Princeton University. He studied in Paris on a Fulbright Scholarship. At the time he began graduate musical studies in the mid-1960s, the Italian composers such as Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti and Giuseppe Verdi had been given little serious academic study. As he noted: \"If you were going to be a serious musicologist, you had to study Beethoven or Bach or Gregorian chants, but Rossini -- that was a pretty funny idea\" However, he persisted and notes that \"I went to Princeton University for graduate work in musicology (and) I fell more in love with the music and wrote my doctoral dissertation on the music of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. Then I went to Paris on a Fulbright and studied Rossini's operas.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Gossett's work has frequently taken him to Italy, where he has advised on the presentations of productions at the Rossini Opera Festival in Rossini's hometown of Pesaro, and he has worked directly with the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani (Institute of Verdi Studies) in Parma which was founded in 1960. Also, for the 2001 centenary of Verdi's death, he worked with the Teatro Regio di Parma on their programming. In 1968 he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago where he remained for the rest of his career. He was a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago at the time of his death in 2017.\n\nGiven that Gossett's musical interests focus on 19th-century Italian opera (especially the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi), most of his career was devoted to being General Editor of two important projects while at the University of Chicago: the research for the preparation of critical editions of all the operas of both Rossini (some 70) and Verdi (some 33, in their various forms). These are being prepared and gradually published as \"The Works of Giuseppe Verdi\" (by the University of Chicago Press in collaboration with the Italian publishing house Casa Ricordi of Milan) and of \"The Works of Gioachino Rossini\" (by Bärenreiter Verlag, Kassel).\n\nIn an interview, Gossett explained what he means by the term \"critical edition\":\n\nBy critical edition of an opera I have always meant an edition that bases itself wherever possible on the very finest and most accurate sources for an opera. That means that it must study the entire performance history of a work. In some cases of course we have an autograph manuscript, and that helps us, but it is also where many of the problems start, because composers are known to have made mistakes in their autograph manuscripts. And therefore we are required – we feel it is necessary – to intervene and to correct errors that sometimes have been perpetrated on these works by printed editions from the beginning, so they are just mistakes in the old editions, simple mistakes.\nElsewhere, he explained the overall aim of the production of critical editions of the operas by using the example of Rossini's \"Il viaggio a Reims\":\n\nWe used sources in Rome, Paris, Vienna, and New York. The scores reprinted cheaply today simply reproduce all the errors, all the faults of these 19th-century scores—most of which were produced very quickly and, in Verdi's own words, \"are filled with errors.\" ... The new critical editions have tried, for the first time, to return to authentic sources and they allow performers to have access to the various versions sanctioned by the composers.\nAs he has explained, Gossett does not believe that singers need to base their interpretations entirely on everything contained in a critical edition. His aim is \"that performers should base their work on the finest editions possible, and that’s what we try to produce\".\n\nAs of 2004, it was noted that \"Gossett's team (had) completed 12 of 33 projected volumes of Verdi's work and more than 30 volumes of an expected 70 for Rossini. 'I'll never get through the Rossini,' Gossett said. 'But the Verdi – I'm hoping.'\" However, in July 2013, the University of Chicago's \"Verdi Critical Edition - Available Titles\" page shows 17 opera titles by Verdi\n\nHowever, he is on record as denying that the Claudio Scimone edition of \"Maometto II\" is a critical edition in the true sense of the word, but is more a performing edition by Scimone as conductor.\nRossini's \"Tancredi\", \"Ermione\" and \"Semiramide\" are three of critical editions which he has personally edited, while his most recent work is Verdi's \"La forza del destino\" which, while yet to be formally published, was performed at the San Francisco Opera in November 2005 in its 1869 version. The 1862 version was presented in the Stadttheater, Bern in April 2006.\n\nIn the US, he has consulted with the Houston Grand Opera (in 1979 for the first production of the critical edition of \"Tancredi\", with its then newly discovered tragic ending, starring Marilyn Horne). He has worked three times with the Metropolitan Opera: for its November 1990 production of \"Semiramide\" ; for its 1993 production of \"Stiffelio\"; and for its 1997 production of \"La cenerentola\". He has also worked with The Santa Fe Opera in 2000 for Rossini's \"Ermione\"; and with the Chicago Lyric Opera for the first presentations of Rossini's long-lost \"Il viaggio a Reims\" in 2003. Gossett again acted as consultant to The Santa Fe Opera during rehearsals for its 2012 season production of the new critical edition of Rossini's original \"Maometto II\" of 1820 and he returned in the same capacity during rehearsals of the company's new production of Rossini's \"La donna del lago\" during the 2013 season.\n\nFor the 2010 presentations of Verdi's \"Attila\" for the Met, Gossett also worked with conductor Riccardo Muti on revisions to the score based on new research. This has become a new critical edition of the opera.\n\nMuti has acknowledged Gossett's role in clarifying ambiguities (in this case in \"Rigoletto\") which had crept into many texts.\n\nGossett was awarded the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's \"Distinguished Achievement Award\" in 2004, which gained him a prize of $1.5 million to facilitate his research. Also, in 1998, the Italian government gave him the \"Cavaliere di Gran Croce\", the highest honor that can be awarded to a civilian. Academically, he has been President of the American Musicological Society and of the Society for Textual Scholarship, as well as Dean of the Division of the Humanities at the University of Chicago. In 2008 Gossett was appointed foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.\n\n\n\nMusicologist Roger Parker, General Editor of \"The Critical Edition of the Operas of Gaetano Donizetti\" (Casa Ricordi, Milan)\n\nNotes\n\nCited sources\n\n"}
{"id": "146751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146751", "title": "Probable cause", "text": "Probable cause\n\nIn United States criminal law, probable cause is the standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal or the issuing of a search warrant. The principle behind the standard is to limit the power of authorities to perform random or abusive searches (unlawful search and seizure), and to promote lawful evidence gathering and procedural form during criminal arrest and prosecution. The standard also applies to personal or property searches.\n\nThe term comes from the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution:\n\n\"Probable\" in this case may relate to statistical probability or to a general standard of common behavior and customs. The context of the word \"probable\" here is not exclusive to community standards, and could partially derive from its use in formal mathematical statistics as some have suggested; \"but cf. probō, Latin etymology.\"\n\nIn U.S. immigration proceedings, the “reason to believe” standard has been interpreted as equivalent to probable cause.\n\nA common definition is \"a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious person's belief that certain facts are probably true\". Notable in this definition is a lack of requirement for public position or public authority of the individual making the recognition, allowing for use of the term by citizens and/or the general public.\n\nIn the context of warrants, the \"Oxford Companion to American Law\" defines probable cause as \"information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant)\". \"Probable cause\" is a stronger standard of evidence than a reasonable suspicion, but weaker than what is required to secure a criminal conviction. Even hearsay can supply probable cause if it is from a reliable source or supported by other evidence, according to the \"Aguilar–Spinelli test\".\n\nIn \"Brinegar v. United States\", the U.S. Supreme Court defines probable cause as \"where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a man of reasonable caution that a crime is being committed.\"\n\nThe use of probable cause in the United States and its integration in the Fourth Amendment has roots in English common law and the old saying that \"a man's home is his castle\". This is the idea that someone has the right to defend their \"castle\" or home from unwanted \"attacks\" or intrusion. In the 1600s, this saying started to apply legally to landowners to protect them from casual searches from government officials.\n\nIn the 1700s, the British use of the writs of assistance and general warrants, which allowed authorities to search wherever and whenever sometimes, without expiration date, in the American colonies were raised in several court cases. The first was in Massachusetts in 1761 when a customs agent submitted for a new writ of assistance and Boston merchants challenged its legality. In the case the lawyer for the merchants James Otis argued that writs of assistance violated the fundamentals of English Law and was unconstitutional. John Adams, a lawyer at the time who later wrote the Massachusetts provision on which the Fourth Amendment heavily relied, was impacted by James Otis's argument\n\nA case against general warrants was the English case \"Entick v. Carrington\" (1765). In that case, Lord Camden the chief judge said that general warrants were not the same as specific warrants and that parliament or case law could not authorize general warrants. Along with these statements, Lord Camden also affirmed that the needs of the state were more important than the individuals rights. This upheld the ideology of the social contract while holding to idea that the government purpose was to protect the property of the people. He called for the government to seek reasonable means in order to search private property, as well as a cause.\n\nIn early cases in the United States, the Supreme Court held that when a person is on probation, the standard required for a search to be lawful is lowered from \"probable cause\" to \"reasonable grounds\" or \"reasonable suspicion\". Specifically, the degree of individualized suspicion required of a search was a determination of when there is a sufficiently high probability that criminal conduct is occurring to make the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest reasonable. The Supreme Court held:\n\nLater, in \"Samson v. California\", the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion is not even necessary:\n\nThe court held that reasonableness, not individualized suspicion, is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment. It has been proposed that Fourth Amendment rights be extended to probationers and parolees, but such proposals have not gained traction. There is not much that remains of the Fourth Amendment rights of probationers after waiving their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. An essay called \"They Released Me from My Cage...But They Still Keep Me Handcuffed\" was written in response to the \"Samson\" decision.\n\nIt has been argued that the requirement that a police officer must have individualized suspicion before searching a parolee's person and home was long considered a foundational element of the Court's analysis of Fourth Amendment questions and that abandoning it in the name of crime prevention represents an unprecedented blow to individual liberties.\n\nIn the United States, use of a trained dog to smell for narcotics has been ruled in several court cases as sufficient probable cause. A K-9 Sniff in a public area is not a search according to the Supreme Court's ruling in 1983 \"United States v. Place\". In this particular case, Place was in the New York Airport, and DEA agents took his luggage, even though he refused to have his bag searched. His luggage smelled of drugs, and the trained dog alerted the agents to this. Dogs alerting their officers provides enough probable cause for the officer to obtain a warrant. The DEA then procured a warrant and found a sizable amount of drugs in Place's luggage. It was not considered a search until after the warrant because a trained dog can sniff out the smell of narcotics, without having to open and look through the luggage.\n\nThe power of probable cause by K-9 units smelling for drugs is not limited to just airports, but even in schools, public parking lots, high crime neighborhood streets, mail, visitors in prisons, traffic stops, etc. If there is an incident where the dog alerts its officer, the probable cause from the dog is considered enough to conduct a search, as long as one of the exceptions to a warrant are present, such as plain view, incident to arrest, automobile, exigency, or with a stop and frisk. During a traffic stop and checkpoint, it is legal for police to allow a drug dog to sniff the exterior of the car. This is legal as long as it does not cause the traffic stop to be any longer than it would have been without the dog. If the dog finds a scent, it is again a substitute for probable cause.\n\nUnder the 2001 USA Patriot Act, law enforcement officials do not need probable cause, in order to access communications records, credit cards, bank numbers and stored emails held by third parties. They only need reasonable suspicion that the information they are accessing is part of criminal activities. Under this, officers are authorized for a court order to access the communication information. Only certain information can be accessed under this act (such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, etc.). Probable cause is needed for more detailed information because law enforcement needs a warrant to access additional information. Generally, law enforcement is not required to notify the suspect. However, the text of the Patriot Act limits the application of that statute to issues that clearly involve the national security of the United States. \n\nIf voluntary consent is given and the individual giving the consent has authority over the search area, such as a car, house, business, etc. then a law enforcement officer does not need probable cause or even reasonable suspicion. If the person does not give voluntary consent, then the officer needs probable cause, and in some cases, a search warrant may be required to search the premises. Unless another exclusion to the fourth amendment of the US constitution occurs, when the person withdraws their consent for searching, the officer has to stop looking immediately.\n\nIn the United States, the term probable cause is used in accident investigation to describe the conclusions reached by the investigating body as to the factor or factors which caused the accident. This is primarily seen in reports on aircraft accidents, but the term is used for the conclusion of diverse types of transportation accidents investigated in the United States by the National Transportation Safety Board or its predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Board.\n\n\n\nIn the various states, a probable cause hearing is the preliminary hearing typically taking place before arraignment and before a serious crime goes to trial. The judge is presented with the basis of the prosecution's case, and the defendant is afforded full right of cross-examination and the right to be represented by legal counsel. If the prosecution cannot make a case of probable cause, the court must dismiss the case against the accused.\n\nIn the criminal code of some European countries, notably Sweden, probable cause is a higher level of suspicion than \"justifiable grounds\" in a two level system of formal suspicion. The latter refers only to the suspect being able to and sometimes having a motive to commit the crime and in some cases witness accounts, whereas probable cause generally requires a higher degree of physical evidence and allows for longer periods of detention before trial.

{"id": "48457395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48457395", "title": "Roman graffiti", "text": "Roman graffiti\n\nIn archaeological terms, graffiti (plural of graffito) is a mark, image or writing scratched or engraved into a surface. There have been numerous examples found on sites of the Roman Empire, including taverns and houses, as well as on pottery of the time. In many cases the graffiti tend toward the rude, with a line etched into the basilica in Pompeii reading \"Lucilla made money from her body,\" phallic images, as well as erotic pictures. Studying the graffiti left behind from the Roman Period can give a better understanding of the daily life and attitudes of the Roman people with conclusions drawn about how everyday Romans talked, where they spent their time, and their interactions within those spaces.\n\nInscriptions cover a range of topics from poems, advertisements, political statements, to greetings. There are two forms of graffiti: painted inscriptions (usually public notices) and inscribed inscriptions (spontaneous messages).\n\nOver 11,000 graffiti samples have been uncovered in the excavations of Pompeii. Archaeologists have been studying and recording graffiti in Pompeii since the 1800s. These documentations remain the best evidence of over 90 percent of recorded graffiti from the area, which has not survived the elements.\n\nThis domestic residence shows that ancient graffiti was not limited to the public sphere, as graffiti is in modern day. This site, discovered in the 1960s, has benefited from preservation efforts, leaving the graffiti samples in their original context and remain legible. There is a unique feature of eleven graffiti containing multiple lines of poetry. For the most part, the poems are arranged vertically and respect the space of the others. This mix of original work and common phases are not a miscellaneous group because of the number and composition; instead, it appears that a conversation has formed.\n\nOne passage on the staircase reads:\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nAn example here demonstrates a familiarity with Virgil and hexameter verse. On the doorpost of the shop near pictures of Aeneas and Romulus is written:\n\nTranslating to:\n\nThe owl is a signifier of Minerva, the goddess who has been said to be protector over the profession of fullones.\n\nMary Beard notes that there are more than fifty examples of graffiti referring to Virgil in Pompeii alone, but also notes that the majority of the references are to the opening lines of Book 1 or Book 2 of the Aeneid, suggesting that these lines may have been widely known in the fashion \"To be, or not to be\" is known today.\n\nGraffiti is often meant to be seen and expects to be read. A dialogue is formed between the reader and the inscription and can be simple as they speak directly to the readers in forms such as \"if anyone sits here, let him read this before everything else…\" as well as \"He who writes this is in love… and I who reads this am a prick.\"\n\nThere are also dialogues where one passage answers another. These responses take the forms of greetings, insults, prayers, etc.\n\nTranslates to :\n\nA response to this translates to:\n\nWord squares (magic square) and riddles are also common forms of the culture of graffiti. These show a level of mental agility and flexibility of language.\n\nExamples of handwritten alphabets are common graffiti in Pompeii and could be evidence of children practicing their alphabet. This lends to the argument that children were responsible for much of the graffiti. However, the height of the inscriptions and location may contradict this.\n\nWriting around 100 AD, Plutarch wrote of graffiti: \"There is nothing written in them which is either useful or pleasing – only so-and-so 'remembers' so-and-so, and 'wishes him the best', and is 'the best of his friends', and many things full of such ridiculousness\".\n\n21st-century scholars have found more to study and enjoy in the visual art and intertextuality of Roman graffiti.\n\nMore than simply text and thought, Roman graffiti give insight into the use of space and how people interacted within it. Studying the motivation behind the marks reveals a trend for the graffiti to be located where people spend time and pass most frequently as they move through a space. Common places for graffiti are staircases, central peristyle, and vestibule. The use of graffiti by Romans has been said to be very different from the defacing trends of modern day, with the text blending into the walls and rooms by respecting the frescoes and decoration with the use of small letters. In this way, the environment influences the graffiti by subject and organization, and the graffiti in turn changes and influences the environment.\n\nTypical techniques when studying graffiti include drawing each inscription and taking photographs if special attention is required. When only a shadow of the engravings are visible to the naked eye, other methods of observance are needed to decipher the engravings.\n\nUsing 3D laser profilometry to analyze the roughness of a surface, archaeologists have been able to determine the tools used in engraving. This technique merged with photographs taken with oblique light, different lighting conditions, and results from electrostatic detection devices have increased the readability of illegible inscriptions.\n\n"}

{"id": "41469307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41469307", "title": "Sexing the Body", "text": "Sexing the Body\n\nSexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality is a 2000 book by the biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling, in which the author explores the social construction of gender, and the social and medical treatment of intersex people. She stated that in it she sets out to \"convince readers of the need for theories that allow for a good deal of human variation and that integrate the analytical powers of the biological and the social into the systematic analysis of human development.\"\n\nFausto-Sterling mentions the most common types of intersex, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), gonadal dysgenesis, hypospadias, and unusual chromosome compositions such as XXY (Klinefelter Syndrome) or X0 (Turner Syndrome).\n\nShe gives John Money's view of intersexuality by stating,: “Intersexuality, in Money's view, resulted from fundamentally ab-normal processes. Their patients required medical treatment because they ought to have become either a male or a female. The goal of treatment was to assure proper psychosexual development by assigning the young mixed-sex child to the proper gender…” Money declared, \"From the sum total of hermaphroditic evidence, the conclusion that emerges is that sexual behavior and orientation as male or female does not have an innate, instinctive basis.” Money is disproved in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body when it is stated that congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) girls tend to manufacture larger amounts of masculine hormones until birth and the production of these male hormones raises the question among scientist of whether or not the excess male hormones that a CAH girl produces has an effect on her brain development.\n\nFausto-Sterling argues surgery on intersex babies should wait until the child can make an informed decision, and label surgery without consent as genital mutilation. In \"Sexing the Body\", Sterling describes the grueling process of transforming an intersex person into the desired sex, and the appearance of a \"densely scarred and immobile penis\" or “extensive suturing [or] skin transplants in such a way that it seems difficult for anyone to endure. Although the decision should be made strictly by the parents without any coercion or influence presented by the doctor, it is ultimately the “physicians who decide how to manage intersexuality”. No matter how impartial they attempt to be, physicians simply “act out of, and perpetuate, deeply held beliefs about male and female sexuality, gender roles, and the (im)proper place of homosexuality in normal development” when performing the necessary surgery for the chosen gender.\n\nFausto-Sterling’s article titled “Of Gender and Genitals: The Use and Abuse of the Modern Intersexual” criticizes the standard model of sex and gender by using the case of intersex individuals by explaining how those individuals are neither male nor female so they do not fit in the sex binary. It is suggested that “bodies… only live within the productive constrains of certain highly regulatory schemas.” People must be “culturally intelligible as males or females”. While the standard model says that sex is biologically determined, Fausto-Sterling challenges this by stating “From the sum total of hermaphroditic evidence, the conclusion that emerges is that sexual behavior and orientation as male or female does not have an innate, instinctive basis.\"\n\nOftentimes, doctors decide the sex of an intersex infant immediately after birth. Doctors choose the sex based on what they believe a male or a female should look like. In essence, society decides what is male or female. Fausto-Sterling portrays how our society puts a great deal of trust in doctors because they are seen as the experts and those who decide what nature tells us. Doctors for decades past have felt the need to immediately “correct” intersex children after birth. Fausto-Sterling states, “The attending physician, realizing that the newborn's genitalia are either/or, neither/both, consults a pediatric endocrinologist (children's hormone specialist) and a surgeon. They declare a state of medical emergency. According to current treatment standards, there is no time to waste in quiet reflection or open-ended consultations with the parents”. Doctors felt that this was a medical emergency because intersex children were seen as abnormal, and because we live in a society based on heternormativity, physicians were pressured to make anything abnormal, normal. Fausto-Sterling mentions that “no masculine women or effeminate men need apply.” These individuals are considered to be “unthinkable, abject, unlivable.” As this belief is deeply rooted in people’s mind, it is essential and imperative for “surgeons, psychologists, and endocrinologists, through their surgical skills, [to] try to make good facsimiles of culturally intelligible bodies.” Contrary to the belief that physicians thought it was vital to immediately decide a sex for an intersex child, evidence shows that just because science chooses a sex for a child that does not guarantee that the child will grow up to “fit” that gender role. For example, the article states, “These individuals seemed to be listening to some inner voice that said that everyone in authority surrounding h/her was wrong. Doctors and parents might have insisted that they were female, removed their testes, injected them with estrogen, and surgically provided them with a vagina, but still, they knew they were really males”. These individuals are the exception to the standard model and a prime example of why the standard model is not relevant. These types of people do not properly fit the sexual dimorphism so a more acceptable categorization would be the alternative model. The alternative model a spectrum with completely male on one side and completely female on the other, leaving room for sexually ambiguous humans to be categorized somewhere in between.\n\nIn \"Of Gender and Genitals\", Anne Fausto-Sterling illustrates how the standard model of the difference between sex and gender can be at times damaging and how it necessitates that doctors’ uphold to certain protocol in order to maintain it. She informs the reader that the extensive surgeries intersex children undergo soon after birth are both “unnecessary and sexually damaging”. Infants, if born intersex, are subjected to a number of considerable surgeries as soon as they are born merely to uphold to society’s standard model. If society’s view changed to that of a gender-sex spectrum, these babies would be given the freedom to choose their own gender when they become of age. Unfortunately that was not the case in the past. Instead, for example, intersex babies, who were chosen to function as a male, experienced multiple surgeries “on their penises during the first couple of years of their lives”. When dealing with the parents of intersex children, doctors must follow certain guidelines so as not to dishearten the parents’ of their children’s normality. Fausto-Sterling specifically references some doctors’ endeavor towards “discouraging any feeling of sexual ambiguity” for their children.\n\nAnne Fausto-Sterling says, \"[o]ur conceptions of the nature of gender difference shape, even as they reflect, the ways we structure our social system and polity; they also shape and reflect our understanding of our physical bodies.\"\n"}

Clinicians' decisions regarding patients' treatment are often influenced by this standard of care (SOC).\n\nPrior to the advent of the first SOCs, there was no semblance of consensus on psychiatric, psychological, medical, and surgical requirements or procedures. Before the 1960s, few countries offered safe, legal medical options and many criminalized cross-gender behaviors or mandated unproven psychiatric treatments. In response to this problem, the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (now known as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health) authored one of the earliest sets of clinical guidelines for the express purpose of ensuring \"lasting personal comfort with the gendered self in order to maximize overall psychological well-being and self-fulfillment.\" These standards are still the most well-known; however, other sets of SOCs, protocols and guidelines do exist, especially outside the United States.\n\nThe \"Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People\" by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), formerly known as the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association Standards of Care, are the most widespread SOC used by professionals working with transsexual, transgender, or gender variant people. The WPATH-SOC are periodically updated and revised. The latest revision was released September 25, 2011. This is the seventh version of the WPATH-SOC since the original 1979 document was drafted. Previous revisions were released in 1980, 1981, 1990, 1998, and 2001.\nIncluded in the guidelines are sections on purpose and use of the WPATH-SOC, the global applicability of the WPATH-SOC, the difference between gender nonconformity and gender dysphoria, epidemiology, treatment of children, adolescents and adults, mental health, hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male or male-to-female; HRT), reproductive health, voice and communication therapy, sex reassignment surgery, lifelong preventive and primary care, applicability of the WPATH-SOC to people living in institutional environments, and applicability of the WPATH-SOC to people with disorders of sex development.\n\nThe sixth revision recommends that mental health professionals document a patient's relevant history in a letter, which should be required by medical professionals prior to physical intervention. One letter is required for hormone replacement therapy or either augmentation mammoplasty or male chest reconstruction. Two additional letters are needed for genital surgeries.\n\nThe Eligibility Criteria and Readiness Criteria in version 6 give certain very specific minimum requirements as prerequisites to HRT or sex reassignment surgery (SRS). For this and other reasons, the WPATH-SOC is a controversial and often maligned document among patients seeking medical intervention (hormones, and/or surgery), who state that their legally protected right to proper medical care and treatment is unjustly and unduly withheld or even denied based on the SOC.\n\nWPATH-SOC sections One through Four are introductory in nature, explaining (section I) the purpose, intent, and need for the SOC, (section II) epidemiological considerations relating to transsexual people, (section III) diagnostic nomenclature, and (section IV) the job of the mental health professional. The assessment and treatment of children and adolescents is covered in section V. \n\nSections Five through Eight begin the actual guide to treatment. They specifically address the manner in which to assess and support gender non-conforming children and how to diagnose transgender identity or transsexualism in both teens and adults; the manner in which to document the diagnoses and recommendations (\"The Letter\") and also covers requirements and treatment using hormones, including use and effects of hormones.\n\nSection Nine covers \"The Real-life Experience,\" during which individuals seeking hormonal and other treatments are expected to begin transitioning publicly to their preferred gender role.\n\nWPATH-SOC sections Ten through Twelve specifically cover the surgical treatment of transsexual people. Section Twelve, titled \"Genital Surgery,\" deals directly with all concerns about sex reassignment surgery. It includes six \"Eligibility Criteria\" and two \"Readiness Criteria\", which are intended to be used by professionals for both diagnosis and guidance before providing patients \"letters of recommendation.\"\n\nThe Thirteenth and final section covers \"post-transition follow-up\".\n\nNumerous criticisms have been made against the WPATH-SOC over the course of its history, some of which are reflected in later versions of the guidelines. Most of these criticisms are related to the strictness of the requirements, noting that the rate of post-surgical regret among transsexual people is very low — lower than many medically necessary and cosmetic procedures with less stringent requirements. Provisions related to the necessity of real-life experience (noting that requiring real-life experience in an incongruous anatomical/social role can be both mentally harmful as well as physically dangerous to the individual) have been particularly under fire. For many, it is safe only to express gender outwardly in limited settings (8/7, 12/7 or 18/7 rather than all day, every day (24/7). This is now taken into consideration in version 7. \nThe WPATH SOC version 6 and 7 allow for referral for puberty blocking medication to be prescribed to youth experiencing puberty, starting at Tanner stage 2 or above. Referral after that age could lead to bodily changes reversible only with surgery (facial shape, secondary sex characteristics); surgically risky (voice pitch); or, irreversible changes (skeletal structure or height). The WPATH SOC version 7 has also removed the set length of time for psychotherapy, in order to facilitate support and referral to transition services in a timely way, should they be required. These changes have led some critics to claim that the criteria are too loose, however, an individualized approach that provides prospective, supportive follow-up and education to families about how to affirm expression, and create an environment for safe exploration has always been recommended. \n\nWPATH has also come under fire for adopting pathological language when referring to Intersex individuals in its latest revision, SOC 7. The SOC uses the term \"Disorders of Sex development\" even though many Intersex individuals don't consider their biological differences a disorder, and argue that the language used by the SOC is stigmatizing and offensive. \n\nIn some countries or areas, local standards of care exist, such as in the Netherlands, Germany or Italy. Also, some health care providers have their own set of SOCs which have to be followed to have access to health care.\nThe criticism about the WPATH-SOCs applies to these as well; some of these SOCs are based on much older versions of the WPATH-SOCs, or are entirely independent of them. A more lenient version that has been increasing in acceptance is the Health Law Standards Of Care, developed by the Health Law Project (also known as the ICTLEP guidelines), which is based on a harm-reduction model.\n\nTreatment according to older SOCs is often reserved for transsexual people only, not for other transgender people, who might not want to undergo the complete set of treatments, or who see themselves outside a binary gender system. Such older SOCs are often used to withhold medical interventions from transgender people altogether.\n\nIn other regions, notably Latin America, surgeons follow no particular set standards and use their own criteria for eligibility for surgery.\n\nIn Western countries the emphasis is on psychiatry or psychology; typically, in Latin America, the emphasis is on the ability to \"pass\", and in Thailand the emphasis is on cross-living experience.\n\n"}

Clark specialises in the philosophy of religion and animal rights, writing from a philosophical position that might broadly be described as Christian Platonist. He is the author of 19 books, including \"The Moral Status of Animals\" (1977), \"The Nature of the Beast\" (1982), \"Animals and Their Moral Standing\" (1997), \"G.K. Chesterton\" (2006), \"Philosophical Futures\" (2011), and \"Ancient Mediterranean Philosophy\" (2012), as well as 77 scholarly articles, and chapters in another 109 books. He is a former editor-in-chief of the \"Journal of Applied Philosophy\" (1990–2001).\n\nClark was born on 30 October 1945 in Luton, Bedfordshire, though the family came originally from Shropshire/Staffordshire. His father, D. A. R. Clark, was an apprentice railway engineer who became a technology teacher, and was later appointed principal of Middlesbrough Technical College, now the University of Teesside, then principal of Nottingham Technical College, now Trent University. His mother, M. K. Clark, was a teacher and the daughter of Samuel Finney. Clark was raised in the Anglican tradition.\n\nAfter attending Nottingham High School (1956–1964), he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford (1964–1968), graduating with a first-class honours degree in greats (classics) in 1968, followed by a fellowship at All Souls (1968–1975). He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1973. Brannon Hancock writes that the philosophers Arthur Prior and Sir Anthony Kenny had a great intellectual influence on Clark at Balliol, while Robin Zaehner was one of his greatest influences at All Souls.\n\nAfter Oxford, he lectured in moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow for nine years, until he was appointed professor of philosophy at Liverpool in 1984. He retired from this post at the end of 2009. He has also been a visiting professor at Vanderbilt University and held an Alan Richardson Fellowship at Durham University. He is married to Gillian Clark, with whom he has three children, Samuel, Alexandra, and Verity.\n\nClark has delivered a number of prestigious lectures, including the 1981–1982 Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, entitled \"From Athens to Jerusalem\", the Stanton Lectures in Philosophy of Religion at the University of Cambridge (1987–1989), and the Wilde Lectures at the University of Oxford (1990). He has also delivered the Scott Holland Lecture at the University of Liverpool (1992), the Aquinas Lecture at the University of Oxford (1994), the Read Tuckwell Lecture at Bristol University (1994), the Royal Institute of Philosophy Lecture at the University of Durham (1995), and the Aquinas Lecture at the Catholic University of Leuven (2000). \n\nClark served on the British government's Animal Procedures Committee, a group that advises the Home Secretary on animal testing, from 1998 until 2006. He has also been involved with the Boyd Group, a think tank set up by researchers involved in animal testing, and others who oppose it.\n\nClark argues that the moral basis of humanism – that all human beings have equal moral status – is now so entrenched, in theory if not in practice, that we fail to consider what a radical idea it used to be. He writes that behind this idea is the notion that human beings are in some way uniquely gifted, perhaps with a share in the divine. This human/non-human divide was promoted to prevent human beings from being treated like animals on some utilitarian calculation, rather than as ends in themselves.\n\nHe writes that we now know non-human animals to be much closer to humans than was previously thought, and therefore similar considerations must be extended to them. He highlights the incongruity of modern thinkers being willing to ignore the idea that human beings were made in the image of God, yet unwilling to accept what he argues is the moral conclusion that stems from the rejection of that idea, namely that we ought not to treat non-humans with radically less consideration than we treat humans. He writes: \"If species differences are only racial differences 'writ large,' and it is plainly wrong to make such racial differences a ground for radically different treatment ... we have to concede that if it is wrong to injure humans it must also be wrong to do identical or very similar injury to non-humans.\" He argues that \"[t]his is often all that is meant by the claim that 'animals have rights.'\"\n\nWhat our forebears lacked was a full understanding of the extent to which our welfare depends upon the health of the global ecosystem and the extent to which our evolutionary cousins can be hurt, harmed and injured in ways analogous to ourselves. The question before us is not simply \"how may we produce the greatest ratio of pleasure to pain\" (a wholly vacuous program), nor yet \"what rights do creatures have before the community formulates them,\" but how may we best order the communities (social and global) of which we are parts? The answer, I believe, must lie in our taking seriously what we already know, that more matters even to animals than their own plain or pleasure, and that our survival even as a species depends upon being able to maintain or create substantial and civil ecosystems at household, civil, national and global levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1995 he held a research grant at the \"Internationales Forschungszentrum Kulturwissenschaften\" in Vienna. From 1997 to 1999 he was commissioned to carry out various studies in the field of education and vocational training. He also lectured on aesthetics and sociology of art at the University of Vienna and at the University of Applied Art in Vienna. In 1999, he was appointed assistant professor at the Institute of Culture Management and Culture Studies of the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna. Having completed his advanced habilitation thesis in 2003, he was appointed university professor for Cultural Institutions Studies at the same institute. In 2009, Zembylas was visiting professor at Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen, and 2010 he moved to the Institute for Music Sociology at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna.\n\nMajor research interests of Tasos Zembylas are epistemology of artistic creative practices, Cultural Institutions Studies, and cultural policy.\nIn the 1990s Tasos Zembylas investigated the formation process of the contemporary concept of art. His approach was to study not only relevant discourses and art theories in visual arts, but, equally important, to describe and analyse institutional structures, processes of valuations and other practices taking place in the art world. He thereby developed a practice-oriented and practice-theoretical approach to the sociology of the arts.\nThe close connection between arts and social practices, as well as between art worlds and social structures embodied in cultural activities, led Zembylas in early 2000s to focus on cultural, social, political and economic analysis of arts and culture. His theoretical efforts resulted in the elaboration of an inter-disciplinary approach towards the major topics of cultural institution studies. In addition to his theoretical work, Zembylas has conducted several empirical studies, notably on public funding of the arts in Austria, which dealt with the legal standards prevailing in administrative subsidy procedures as well as the effects of public funding policies.\nFrom 2006 to 2008, together with Claudia Dürr, Zembylas investigated the literary writing process from an epistemological perspective. The study focused on the formation and effects of artistic-practical know-how, as well as on the role of professional experience in the creative process. This study led to a general epistemology of artistic creative practices.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, together with Andreas Holzer, Annegret Huber, Martin Niederauer and Rosa Reitsamer, Zembylas conducted a similar study on composition processes in the field of contemporary art music. In this case, the focus was on the materiality and processuality of artistic practices. In addition, the synergy of different forms of knowledge (especially tacit knowledge) was systematically investigated.\nTasos Zembylas has also published a literary travelogue about Athos. In it he not only addressed religious practices but also the economic management of the Holy Monastery of Vatopedi, which made the headlines in the international press in 2008 in connection with a real estate scandal.\n\n\"On Sociology of art:\"\n\n\n\"On Philosophy of art:\"\n\n\n\"On Cultural policy:\"\n\n\n\"On Cultural Institutions Studies:\"\n\n\n\"On Epistemology of Creative Processes:\"\n\n\n\"Other topics:\"\n\n\n"}

He has been most influential of increasing traditional Vietnamese Buddhism practices in Vietnam. \n\nThích Thanh Từ began his life in a well-educated family that followed Cao Đài, a Vietnamese religion founded in 1926. He was born on July 24, 1924 in Cần Thơ, Vietnam with the birth name of Trần Hữu Phước. He was determined to become a Buddhist monk after noticing the suffering of his people during wartime and after 3 months of Buddhist duties and at the age of 25 was given his Buddhist name which he is now known by, Thích Thanh Từ. After 3 years of servicing as an expression of gratitude towards his master he finally decided to leave so he could find his true self, which resulted in secluding himself in a meditation chamber that he built in 1966. This led him to discover the concept of Nothingness after many of attempts at other meditation practices. Realizing how powerful his meditation can be he wanted to expose himself to the public and teach the Buddhist ways and lived by the phrase \"After realization, enlighten others.\".\n\nThích Thanh Từ began his teachings in December 1971 with only 10 students and involved scriptures, discourses, history and meditation methods. His focus is to be aware of any false thoughts, but prevent from attaching to them. Three years later opened three new monasteries which included Linh Quang, Chân Không, Bát Nhã monasteries. From the initial 10 students he taught, he went on to teach thousands of other monks and nuns to pass on his dharma teachings. He also founded Thường Chiếu monastery (1974) in Đà Lạt which became the headquarters of his organization in 1986. Thích Thanh Từ discovered meditation to help improve the common practice of Vietnamese Zen in Vietnam, mainly at the site of the Trúc Lâm school. His practice methods are constructed from 3 important keys in historical Zen from China, which consists of patriarch Huệ Khả, Huệ Năng, and Trúc Lâm Đầu Đà. He put together their enlightened ideas and practice which they now practice in his monasteries’. He refers to the \"Transmission of the Lamp\" as one of the main objectives of distributing his teachings among his students of the Trúc Lâm philosophies. He talks about lighting 10 to 20 torches which will then light 30 to 40 torches in order to light up the whole world.\n\nTrúc Lâm was founded in and around the time of Trần Nhân Tông (1258–1308) who was a former king of Vietnam. The first Trúc Lâm Temple was on top of Yên Tử Mountain where Nhan Tong retired to. This was the only school of Zen that was founded in Vietnam instead of originating from China. The Trúc Lâm sect grew enormously with the help of the next 2 patriarchs, Pháp Loa and Huyền Quang. Once they came to the end of their time, the school successfully came to an end. After many attempts to revive the school, Thích Thanh Từ is the most recent and becoming the most successful monk to restore Trúc Lâm. He built a monastery in Yên Tử Mountain to re-connect the meaning of Trúc Lâm to its origin, and while using this name, is able to strengthen the impact of his movement. Although it can be argued that what he had created was not original Trúc Lâm Buddhism but still had a positive effect on the reform of Buddhism on the global level.\n\nHis efforts are brought forth from the principles of 3 patriarchs whom he believes have very minimal amounts of transition from traditional Chinese Buddhism. Thích Thanh Từ claims to be re-establishing the Trúc Lâm traditions but in his own way has modified it from its original ways. He wasn't much of a global influence in his earlier years of work, but in recent history has been on top of Buddhist movements on the global level. His initial work in Vietnam has now moved onwards to western civilization by getting his word across through the translation of books that he has written. He is having the most influence on today's view on Buddhism and what it means to be a Buddhist monk through the implementation of the revived religion referred to as Trúc Lâm.\n\nThích Thanh Từ started writing in 1961 and in over 45 years has written over 50 books.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4287448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4287448", "title": "Zera Yacob (philosopher)", "text": "Zera Yacob (philosopher)\n\nZera Yacob (; \"zar'ā yāʿiqōb\" \"Seed of Jacob,\" modern \"Zer'a Yā'iqōb\"; also spelled \"Zärˀä Yaˁqob\", \"Zar'a Ya'aqob\", or \"Zar'a Ya'eqob\"; 1599–1692) was a seventeenth-century Ethiopian philosopher. His 1667 treatise, known in the original Ge'ez language as the \"Hatata\", has often been compared by a handful of non-traditional scholars to René Descartes' \"Discours de la méthode\" (1637). His writing came at a period when African philosophical literature was significantly oral in character. He believed in following one's natural reasoning instead of believing what one is told by others.\n\nYacob was born into a Tigrayan farmer's family near Aksum in northern Ethiopia, the former capital of Ethiopia under the ancient kingdom of Aksum. Yacob's name means \"The Seed of Jacob\" (\"Zar\" is the Ge'ez word for \"seed\"). Although his father was poor, he supported Yacob's attendance of traditional schools, where he became acquainted with the Psalms of David and educated in the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian faith. He was denounced before Emperor Susenyos (r. 1607-1632), who had turned to the Roman Catholic faith and ordered his subjects to follow his own example.\n\nRefusing to adopt the Catholic faith, Yacob fled into exile with some gold and the Book of Psalms. On the road to Shewa in the south, he found a cave at the foot of the Tekezé River and lived in it as a hermit for two years, praying and developing his philosophy. He wrote of his experience, \"I have learnt more while living alone in a cave than when I was living with scholars. What I wrote in this book is very little; but in my cave I have meditated on many other such things.\"\n\nAfter the death of the Emperor, Susenyos's son Fasiledes (r. 1632-1667), a firm adherent of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, took power, expelling the Jesuits, and extirpated the Catholic faith in his kingdom in 1633. Yacob left his cave and settled in Emfraz. He found a patron, a rich merchant named Habta Egziabher (known as Habtu), and married a maid of the family. He refused to live as a monk and stated that \"the law of Christians which propounds the superiority of monastic life over marriage is false and can’t come from God.\" However, he also rejected polygamy because \"the law of creation orders one man to marry one woman.\"\n\nYacob became the teacher of Habtu's two sons, and at the request of his patron's son Walda Heywat, Yacob wrote his famous 1667 Treatise investigating the light of reason. Yacob is most noted for this ethical philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony. He purported that an action's morality is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. His philosophy is theistic in nature. While he did believe in a deity, whom he referred to as God, he rejected any set of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world. In Hatata in following in the footsteps of great church fathers, Yacob applied the idea of the first cause to his proof for the existence of God. \"If I say that my father and my mother created me, then I must search for the creator of my parents and of the parents of my parents until they arrive at the first who were not created as we [are] but who came into this world in some other way without being generated.\" However, the knowability of God does not depend on human intellect, but \"Our soul has the power of having the concept of God and of seeing him mentally. God did not give this power purposelessly; as he gave the power, so did he give the reality.\"\n\nLittle is known of Yacob's later life. However, it is believed that he lived a fulfilled family life in Emfraz, and remained there for the next 25 years. He died there in 1692. Yacob's year of death was recorded by Walda Heywat in an annotation to the \"Treatise\".\n\n\n\n"}
