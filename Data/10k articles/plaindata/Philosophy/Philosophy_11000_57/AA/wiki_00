{"id": "317524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317524", "title": "Action (philosophy)", "text": "Action (philosophy)\n\nIn philosophy, an action is that which is done by an agent. In common speech, the term is often used interchangeably with the term \"behaviour\". However, in the philosophy of action, behavioural sciences, and the social sciences, a distinction is made: behavior is automatic and reflexive activity, while action is an intentional, purposive, conscious and subjectively meaningful activity . Thus, things like running or throwing a ball is an instance of action; it involves intention, a goal, and a bodily movement guided by the agent. On the other hand, catching a cold is not considered an action because it is something which happens \"to\" a person, not something done \"by\" one.\n\nIn enactivism theory, perception is understood to be sensorimotor in nature. That is, we carry out actions as an essential part of perceiving the world. Alva Noë states:\nWe move our eyes, head and body in taking in what is around us... [we] crane our necks, peer, squint, reach for our glasses or draw near to get a better look...'…'Perception is a mode of activity on the part of the whole animal...It cannot be represented in terms of merely passive, and internal, processes...' \n\nSome would prefer to define actions as requiring bodily movement (see behaviorism). The side effects of actions are considered by some to be part of the action; in an example from Anscombe's manuscript \"Intention\", pumping water can also be an instance of poisoning the inhabitants. This introduces a moral dimension to the discussion (see also Moral agency). If the poisoned water resulted in a death, that death might be considered part of the action of the agent that pumped the water. Whether a side effect is considered part of an action is especially unclear in cases in which the agent isn't aware of the possible side effects. For example, an agent that accidentally cures a person by administering a poison he was intending to kill him with.\n\nA primary concern of philosophy of action is to analyze the nature of actions and distinguish them from similar phenomena. Other concerns include individuating actions, explaining the relationship between actions and their effects, explaining how an action is related to the beliefs and desires which cause and/or justify it (see practical reason), as well as examining the nature of agency. A primary concern is the nature of free will and whether actions are determined by the mental states that precede them (see determinism). Some philosophers (e.g. Donald Davidson) have argued that the mental states the agent invokes as justifying his action are physical states that cause the action. Problems have been raised for this view because the mental states seem to be reduced to mere physical causes. Their mental properties don't seem to be doing any work. If the reasons an agent cites as justifying his action, however, are not the cause of the action, they must explain the action in some other way or be causally impotent.\n\n\n"}

This term refers to the state of imperfection, incompleteness, etc.; or to the state of being imperfect or incomplete etc.; but mainly implies not in existence (Jain usage) or non-existent or no order of taking effect (Sanskrit Grammar).\n\n\"Asiddhatva\", which means - the endless application of rules, occurs on account of conflict or when the question is of conflict, there is no \"asiddhatva\". \"Asiddha\" means – not having taken effect with regard to the application of the other rules belonging to the same section. But, Patanjali states that rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there. Therefore, it is said that the application of a rule should certainly result in finality. According to Jainism, the \"audayika-bhava\" has 21 \"bheda\" or sub-species beginning with \"asiddhatva\" which is the state of unholiness, the lacking of spiritual perfection.\nAshtadhyayi reveals that Pāṇini formulates his rules of grammar in view of a \"samanya\" or 'general', \"visesa\" or 'particular' and \"sesa\" or 'residual' relationship. A particular rule is said to carve out its domain of application from within the domain of its corresponding general rule by way of an \"apavada\" i.e. exception, to its related general rule. A rule is formulated to apply and it is never regarded as completely without the scope of its application. In case two rules simultaneously apply the rule subsequent in order blocks the prior rule; though there are some exceptions. Blocking by a \"bhiranga\" or the externally conditioned rule by \"antaranga\" or the internally conditioned rule is permitted. But, since two entities can be replaced by each other the application of rules can be treated as suspended (\"asiddha\").\n\nPanini has used the word - \"asiddha\", three times, that is, in \"Sutra\"s 6.1.86, 6.4.22 and 8.2.1; in \"Sutra\" 6.4.22 he uses the suffix \"vat\" derived from the term \"vati\" meaning – 'as if', which indicates that simultaneous taking effect of rules in \"Abhiya\" section is not permitted. Only when a rule has taken effect does it make sense to say that it is as if it had not taken effect. The phrase \"purvatrasiddham\" of \"Sutra\" 8.2.1 tells us that the rules in \"tripadi\" can be used in a certain order only as found in Ashtadhyayi, therefore, \"asiddha\" determines in what order rules are to be applied.\n\n\"Asiddhatva\", which means - the endless application of rules, occurs on account of conflict or when the question is of conflict, there is no \"asiddhatva\". \"Asiddha\" means – not having taken effect with regard to the application of the other rules belonging to the same section. But, Patanjali states that rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there. Therefore, it is said that the application of a rule should certainly result in finality. In the Ashtadhyayi of Panini the \"sutra\"s are declared \"asidddha\" in the following instances:\nThe concept of \"asiddhatva\" has been used in Ashtadhyayi\nfinds its application in the \"viddhi\" \"sutra\"s. As a filter- technique it applies word internally in a pre-suffixal stem-suffix relation. \"Sutra\" 6.4.22 lays down the condition of \"samanasryatva\" having the same conditioning element for \"asiddhatva\". According to the \"siddha\"- principle, all rules interact in a transparent way, whereas the \"asiddha\"-principle is a default principle which can be defeated at cost.\n\nA \"sutra\" or a rule is said to be \"asiddha\" in regard to another if, with respect to this latter, it is conceived of as not to exist. The forms to which a \"sutra\" normally applies are as arise according to \"sutra\"s which are \"siddha\" i.e. the rules that can have an effect. The number of forms which fall under a rule depends on the relation to \"sutra\"s which are \"siddha\". The opportunities for application of a rule to cases are determined by the \"sutra\"s which are \"asiddha\" i.e. do not have an effect, by which the forms are added or excluded, that is, by the \"asiddhatva\" of the one \"sutra\" cases are added to the other or excluded from the other which are \"siddha\". By this method the right tracing of the cases that are to conform to a rule, is secured only if, whether by \"sutra\"s which are \"siddha\" or by such \"asiddha\", those substitutions which are desired or even not desired, are secured or prevented respectively.\n\n\"Sutra\" 6.4.22 which reads - असिद्धवदत्रभात् | (\"asiddhavadatrabhaat\") is an \"adhikara\" \"sutra\" that defines the limits up to which it is valid as अभात् (\"a bhaat\"), in which \"sutra\" the word अत्र (\"atra\") means - in that domain or in the domain of the same conditioning element. The rules in the \"asiddhavat\" section apply in the same conditioning (linguistic) element. The word \"asiddhavat\" is taken as a variant of the word \"asiddha\". The purpose of a \"siddha\" is to allow an operation conditioned by a \"sthanin\" (item to be replaced) or prohibit an operation conditioned by a substitute. \"Asiddhatva\" has a blocking effect and also a feeding effect. \"Asiddhatva\" invariably leads to \"Anavastha\".\n\nThe Jain Philosophy extends the concept of Karman beyond the good and the bad and also beyond their resultant enjoyment or punishment. Each kind of karman works with a specified intensity, and there are eight mula-prakrtis (species) of karmans depending upon their prakrti, stithi, rasa and pradesas, viz. Jnanavarana-karmans which obscure knowledge, Darsanavarna-karmanas which obscure undifferentiated cognition, Vedaniya-karmans which produce the feeling of joy and grief, Mohaniya-karmans which obstruct belief and conduct, Ayus-karmans which determine duration of life, Nama-karmans which give various factors of individuality, Gotra-karmans which define family surroundings and Antaraya-karmans which hinder Jiva’s capability of resolution and enjoyment, and their numerous uttara-prakrtis (sub-species).\n\nThe Jain thinkers believe that the time during which the \"karman\"s work and the intensity with which they manifest themselves is definite and that it is possible for all \"karman\"s to increase or decrease their effects and also transform which transformation they call \"samkarma\". Different kinds of \"karman\" which can be related to one another also establish a relationship with the \"Jiva\" (soul) and the states (\"bhava\") produced in it by them. In the \"Jiva\" there can manifest five states – the \"parinamika\" or the essential state, the \"audayika\" or the state which is the consequence of the unhindered realisation of \"karman\"s, the \"aupasamika\" or the state produced by the suppression of the \"karman\"s, the \"ksayika\" or the state resulting from the annihilation of the \"karman\"s and the \"kasayopasamika\" or the mixed state. The \"audayika-bhava\" has 21 \"bheda\" or sub-species beginning with \"asiddhatva\" which is the state of unholiness, the lacking of spiritual perfection.\n\nIn Jain terminology \"asiddhatva\" refers to the unproved state and to the non-existent i.e. whose existence cannot be proved or to the state of non-salvation. \"Siddha\" is the soul who has attained the status of the supreme Soul by shedding all karmic matter associated with itself and then cease to interfere in the affairs of the universe. \"Asiddhatva\" leads to Anavastha which is a \"dosha\" (defect) according to Hemachandra.\n"}

Oral tradition holds that Dahui noticed students engaged in too much intellectual discourse on koans, and then burned the wooden blocks used to print the \"Blue Cliff Record\" to \"rescue disciples from delusion\". \n\nThe text was reconstituted only in the early 14th century by a layman, Zhang Mingyuan (, \"\").

After an extended visit to China for the purpose of studying Zen, on the night before his planned return to Japan, Dogen came across the \"Blue Cliff Record\" for the first time, and stayed up all night making a handwritten copy of the book. Given the size of the book, this story is most likely apocryphal; but Dogen is still credited with introducing the collection to Japan, where it had a wide circulation.\n\nThe \"Blue Cliff Record\" was a subtle and literary text, with wide-ranging philosophical implications, as opposed for example to the more straightforward nature of \"The Gateless Gate\".\n\n\n"}

BonPatron initially targeted grammatical errors typically made by anglophone learners of French. Its purpose was to see how close a web-based grammar checker could replicate what teachers do when correcting student compositions (repeatedly indicating the same mistakes). BonPatron was initially called LePatron but changed its name in 2007 when it became a joint academic/commercial endeavour.\n\nThe site was initially designed for language learners in North America, but it is now used extensively by people whose first language is French, especially in France and Quebec.\n\nIn addition to the main grammar checker, other pedagogical resources have been added over the years (e.g.: a grammar guide, a vocabulary guide and a phonetics guide).\n\nBonPatron has two versions, one that is free and supported by ads (BonPatron.com) and the other that is subscription-based (Pro.BonPatron.com). Both draw on the same error database to identify and explain errors. The main difference is that the subscription-based version accepts longer texts.

The main findings from these evaluations are: a) BonPatron is able to identify approximately 90% of errors typical of learners writing in French; b) BonPatron stands apart from other grammar checkers because of its pedagogical design ; c) BonPatron promotes learning and its use leads to a reduced number of errors in learner texts.\n"}

The BTF intends to be the voice of the Tamil Community in the UK by raising the issues on Tamils in UK and to bring awareness to the issues affecting Tamil people in the island of Sri Lanka and around the world. The BTF's work is focused on addressing the root cause to the conflict through an international justice mechanism to bring truth and justice to all victims of war and to bring end to the entrenched culture of impunity in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe BTF's vision for a lasting peace and security through a negotiated political settlement to the Tamil national question by recognising the Tamil people’s right in the North-East of the island of Sri Lanka and hope to bridge the voice between the British Tamil Community and the Tamil people in the island of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government banned the organization as a front for the LTTE and was considered a terrorist group. However the lack of evidence to link the BTF and with the LTTE and terror activities resulted in the ban eventually getting lifted in 2015 as a bid to achieve reconciliation.\n\nThe British Tamils Forum was established as an advocacy group in 2006, with the support of Sri Lankan Tamils to undertake high level diplomacy, engaging with the members of parliament, government representatives, policy makers, civil society organisations and to mobilise the Tamil Community in the UK to on Sri Lankan Tamil issues. In 2010, BTF evolved as a nonpartisan, grassroots community organisation and representing a collective voice of the Tamil Community in the UK, by bringing together individuals, and Tamil organisations in a bottom-up structure, governed along the principles of participatory democracy.\n\nIn January 2008, the Forum called for a boycott of Sri Lankan Airlines as well as other trade and travel sanctions, in protest at the Government of Sri Lanka's withdrawal from a ceasefire with the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, after both sides had violated the agreement numerous times after LTTE instigation. Ivan Pedropillai of the forum stated that \"£12m in foreign currency earned annually by the airline was being used to reinforce the government's war chest.\" The Forum organised a meeting chaired by MP Keith Vaz who compared the Tamil plight to the Rwandan genocide, Darfur killings and Bosnian ethnic cleansing. BTF spokesman Suren Surendiran surmised that the international community had continually pursued a double standard in its approach to conflict resolution in Sri Lanka compared to in states such as Zimbabwe, stating that the Sri Lankan government was \"abusing the Tamils’ fundamental human rights and killing innocent Tamil civilians with the aid and assistance from the international community.\"\n\nOn 16 July 2008, the BTF displayed a photo exhibition, sponsored by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Tamils (APPGT), which was held in the British Houses of Parliament premises on the anniversary of the Black July pogrom, and marked 50 years since the 1958 riots on the island. Photos depicted political figures according to BTF responsible for structural and physical violence in the North-East since Ceylon's independence from Britain as well as victims of the Sri Lankan civil war. The event was attended by MPs of all partys, Members of the House of Lords, Former Cabinet Ministers, Mayors, Councillors, University students, and representatives of international & UK organisations.\n\nAttendees included three MPs of the Tamil National Alliance - Ms Padmini Sithamparanathan MP,\nJayananthamoorthi MP and Gagendran MP, a representative of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in London, Labour Party MPs Joan Ryan MP, Virendra Sharma MP, Keith Vaz MP, Andy Love MP and Lord Waddington QC of the Conservative Party.

According to a column by Andrew Gilligan, Livingstone was accused by the Sri Lankan High Commission and Gilligan as speaking to \"a front of the terror group LTTE.\" The BTF rejected the allegation. Gilligan has been noted by Livingstone to have led a sustained partisan campaign against the former mayor during his time in office. At the meeting, co-organised with councillor Thaya Iddaikadar and local Harrow Tamilians, Livingstone stated of the claim \"the Metropolitan Police came under [me] and where there was a legitimate request for a legitimate event his office would always be supportive.\" Livingstone also gave the forum his \"personal commitment\" that he would support its candlelit vigil in Trafalgar Square in July 2008 to mark the 25th anniversary of \"Black July.\"\n\nAnnual political rallies are organised by the BTF and in June, July, September and October 2008, the forum organised and participated in several public demonstrations in London. It worked in union with the NSSP, the TYO (Tamil Youth Organisation), S4P (Solidarity for Peace), Socialist Resistance, the Socialist Party, International Socialist Group and South Asia Solidarity Group in condemning Mahinda Rajapakse's visit to London, and supported the right to self determination of the Tamil people in \"Tamil Eelam.\" All Party debates in UK Parliament have highlighted gatherings organised by the BTF and the issues the forum has raised.\n\nIn the wake of a return to full-scale hostilities in 2008 on the island, with Tamil civilians moving further into rebel areas amid army offensives and increasing international concern on the plight of civilians caught in Sri Lanka's conflict, the BTF released a statement, responding to an assertion by Lord Malloch Brown that \"the LTTE should allow free movement of civilians\", accusing the Sri Lankan Government of deliberately\n\"\"restricting free movement of civilians within and out of Jaffna Peninsula, where the Sinhala army is an occupying force.\" Its statement went on to note how \"degrading restrictions laid on the Tamil community living in and around Colombo, restrictions placed on journalists to travel around Sri Lanka to report on current security situations and human rights violations and the inhuman treatment of IDPs by restricting their mobility, by placing them in 'detention centres' (e.g. in Mannar) [was] in contravention of humanitarian practices, human rights laws, U.N. Charters and Geneva Conventions.\"\" The forum has criticized British authorities for not condemning the Sri Lankan Government's human rights violations.\n\nOn 31 January 2009, up to 100,000 people marched through London on a BTF co-organised demonstration, protesting the deaths of hundreds of Tamils in Sri Lankan army attacks and demanding a permanent ceasefire.

{"id": "41154158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41154158", "title": "Chabad philosophy", "text": "Chabad philosophy\n\nChabad philosophy comprises the teachings of the leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch, a Hasidic movement. Chabad Hasidic philosophy focuses on religious concepts such as God, the soul, and the meaning of the Jewish commandments.\n\nTeachings are often drawn from classical Judaic teachings and Jewish mysticism. Classical Judaic writings and Jewish mysticism, especially the Zohar and the Kabbalah of Rabbi Isaac Luria, are frequently cited in Chabad works. These texts are used both as sources for Chabad teachings as well as material requiring interpretation by Chabad authors.\n\nWhile Chabad was founded by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Chabad philosophy is based on the teachings of Baal Shem Tov (founder of Hasidism) and the Magid of Mezritch (the Baal Shem Tov's successor and Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teacher and mentor).\n\nThe teachings of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Chabad Rebbe, form the basis of Chabad philosophy. Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teachings were greatly expanded upon by succeeding generations of Chabad Rebbes. One of the most central Chabad works is the \"Tanya\" by Rabbi Schneur Zalman, and many themes found in the Tanya receive greater treatment in subsequent works.\n\nAccording to Shneur Zalman's work \"Tanya\", the intellect consists of three interconnected processes: \"Chochma\" (wisdom), \"Bina\" (understanding), and \"Da'at\" (knowledge). While other branches of Hasidism focused primarily on the idea that \"God desires the heart\", Shneur Zalman argued that God also desires the mind, and that the mind is the \"gateway\" to the heart. With the Chabad philosophy, he elevated the mind above the heart, arguing that \"understanding is the mother of fear and love for God\".\n\nAccording to Jonathan Sacks, in Shneur Zalman's system, \"Chochma\" represents \"the creation in its earliest potentiality; the idea of a finite world as was first born in the divine mind. \"Binah\" is the idea conceived in its details, the result of contemplation. \"Da'at\" is, as it were, the commitment to creation, the stage at which the idea becomes an active intention.\" While in Kabbala there are clearly delineated levels of holiness, in Hasidism and Chabad philosophy these are grounded in the mundanities of people's inner lives. So in reality — according to the Chabad analogy — \"Chochma\" is the birth of an idea in the mind, \"Binah\" is the contemplation, and \"Da'at\" is the beginning of the actualisation of an idea. Sacks argues that this provided a psychological formulation that enabled the hasid to substantiate his mystical thoughts. \"This was an important advance because bridging the gap between spiritual insight and daily behaviour had always been a problem for Jewish mysticism.\"\n\nChabad philosophy argues that man is neither static nor passive nor dependent on others to connect to God. Shneur Zalman rejected all ideas of aristocratic birth and elitism — he argued for meritocracy where all were capable of growth, every Jew — in his view — was capable of becoming a \"Tzadik\".\n\nChabad often contrasted itself with other schools (termed by Chabad thinkers as \"Chagat\") of Hasidism. While all Hasidism have a certain focus on the emotions, Chagat saw emotions as a reaction to physical stimuli, such as dancing singing or beauty. Shneur Zalman, on the other hand, taught that the emotions must be led by the mind, and thus the focus of Chabad thought was to be Torah study and prayer rather than esotericism and song. As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In \"Tanya\", he defines his approach as \"moach shalit al halev\" (Hebrew: \"מוח שליט על הלב\", \"the brain ruling the heart\").\n\nPrayer takes a central place in Chabad philosophy. In the Tanya, the desire to pray is referred to as the \"desire for life\". Rabbi Shneur Zalman wrote to one Hassidic community, counselling those who were unable to remain at the synagogue for lengthy prayers, to leave early, rather than disturb the rest of the congregation.\n\nA central position in Chabad philosophy is the notion that the ultimate service of God can be achieved through contemplation and other cognitive processes, rather than through emotions. Chabad philosophy differs from the teachings of other Hasidic groups in this regard, placing greater emphasis on the use of the mind's cognitive faculties in religious devotional efforts. Chabad philosophy provides a conceptual approach to understanding God and other spiritual matters, maintaining that contemplating such topics constitutes Avodat Hashem (\"the service of God\").\n\nChabad philosophy also incorporated the teachings of Kabbalah as a means to deal with one's daily life and psyche. It teaches that every aspect of the world exists only through the intervention of God. Through an intellectual approach and meditations, Chabad teaches that one can attain complete control over one's actions.\n\nShneur Zalman fought against the perception that was prevalent in the early years of Hasidism that the movement neglected Talmudic study by focusing too heavily on mysticism and obscurantism. He emphasized that mysticism without Talmudic study was worthless — even dangerous. Without Talmudic study, he argued, the mind could never be elevated — and if the mind is not elevated, the soul will starve. On the other hand, he argued that while Torah was to be the focus of all study, it was also important to integrate the Torah's teachings into one's life. In a letter to Joshua Zeitlin of Shklow, Shneur Zalman wrote: \"The Hasidim, too, set aside time for study. The difference between them and the Misnagdim is this: the latter set time for study and they are limited by time, whereas the former make the Torah their path of life.\"\n\nShneur Zalman taught that Torah must be studied joyously – studying without joy is frowned upon. He provided a metaphor: when a \"mitzvah\" is fulfilled an angel is created. But if the \"mitzvah\" was joyless then the angel too will be dispirited. Thus, while Shneur Zalman emphasized that Hasidism focus on traditional Jewish scholarship rather than on mysticism, he was emphatic that this must be done with zeal and joy.\n\nRabbi Shneur Zalman stated that in the bible, lofty teachings are transcribed in the form of stories. Rabbi Shneur Zalman quotes an unnamed source, stating that studying such biblical episodes simply as stories does not constitute the fulfillment of the Jewish commandment of \"Torah study\".\n\nIn Chabad thought, the study of Kabbalah is seen, in some instances, not only as an act of religious study, but as a way to fulfill other Jewish commandments. In the Tanya, the study of Kabbalah is divided between the study of Seder Hishtalshelus (the Kabbalistic theory of the evolution of the universe), and the study of the esoteric meaning of the commandments. The study of the commandments is said to be a superior form of study, because it relates more closely to the performance of mitzvoth, and in some cases, is considered to take the place of the commandment itself.\n\n\"Seder Hishtalshelus\" (), meaning \"Order of Development/Evolution\", refers in Kabbalah and Hasidic thought to the chain-like descent of Spiritual Worlds (\"Olam/Olamot\") between God and Creation. Each spiritual \"Olam-World\" denotes a complete realm of existence, resulting from its general proximity or distance to Divine revelation. Each realm is also a form of consciousness reflected in this World through the psychology of the soul. The concept of \"Seder Hishtalshelus\" is explored in numerous Chabad philosophical works.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Shneur Zalman, there are two main forms of human love for God. One form, called the \"natural love\", is one that is brought about through the subjection of bodily drives, the other, \"produced love\", is the result of contemplation on topics which arouse such emotions.\n\n\"Ahavat Yisrael\" (Hebrew: אהבת ישראל, \"love for one’s fellow Jew\") is a biblical precept, greatly elaborated in Chabad thought. In the Tanya, Rabbi Shneur Zalman states that the obligation to love one's fellow Jew extends even to sinners.\n\nIn Chabad thought, charity is seen not only as a physical act of giving, but as a conduit for spiritual enlightenment. In the Tanya, giving charity is said to draw inspiration and bring about humility.\n\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson advanced, in his writings and lectures, a proposed unity between opposing concepts. He proposed that it was possible to unite the mundane aspects of the world with the aspect of \"godliness\" in the world. Schneerson emphasized the significance of creating an \"abode for God on this world\". Consequently, he encouraged his followers to unite a life in the modern world with the teachings of Judaism. He felt that the world was not a contradiction to the word of God, and it was to be embraced rather than shunned.\n\nSchneerson taught that the use of modern technology does not necessarily contradict a life of spirituality. For that reason, Chabad has consistently utilized modern technology to spread its message. Since its inception, Chabad have used the radio, and later television, satellite feeds, and the Internet to spread its message.\n\n\"Dira Betachtonim\" () is the process of manifesting the presence of God within the world. An examination of \"Dirah Betachtonim\" is found in \"Samech Vov\" by the fifth Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn. In \"Samech Vov\", this concept is described as the ultimate purpose of creation.\n\n\"Dirah Betachtonim\" is also explored by the seventh Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel. Central to the \"Dirah Betachtonim\" concept is the notion of sublimating the physical aspects of existence.\n\nIn Chabad philosophy, \"yeshut\" (\"selfhood\" or \"self-assertion\") is seen as the antithesis to \"yichud\" (\"unity\"), a denial of the reality that God \"fills the heavens and the earth\" and that there is none besides Him. \"Bitul Hayesh\" means total self-negation and a conscious awareness of the ultimate nature of man. \"Bitul Hayesh\" is achieved by one's reflection on God's greatness, exaltedness and majesty. For when one feels that they are in the presence of God, they will feel a sense of insignificance and humility. And at the same time, the worshiper will feel a passionate adoration for God, and a desire to cleave to God.\n\nA number of other important concepts in Chabad philosophy are referenced in scattered locations in Chabad literature. Though these topics were discussed in brief and were not the focus of any major work, new insights have been drawn from their treatment in Chabad thought.\n\nIn its earlier formulations, Hasidic thought had elevated the rebbe to a level above that of typical hasid. A rebbe was closer to God, his prayers were more amenable to Him, and a hasid should satisfy himself with attachment to the Rebbe and hence indirectly to God. A rebbe was to be a living example of perfection and would concern himself with intellectualism on behalf of the followers. According to Sacks, Chabad stressed the individual responsibilities of every Jew: \"The rebbe...became more of a teacher and adviser, recognising the vocation of each of his followers, guiding them towards it, uncovering their strengths, and rejoicing in their achievements.\"\n\nIn Chabad thought, the Rebbe is not an intermediary between the Hasid and God. Rather, the role of the rebbe was to train followers to become spiritually self-sufficient and to turn to their Rebbe for instructions rather than intercession with God, miracles or blessings.\n\nHasidism traditionally demanded that every Hasid personally participate in the dissemination of Torah and Judaism to one's surroundings and seek out the benefit of one's fellow Jew. Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn said: \"A Hasid is he who surrenders himself for the benefit of another.\" Beyond this, Chabad demands \"pnimiyut\" (inwardness / sincerity): one should not act superficially, as a mere act of faith, but rather with inner conviction. The relationship the Chabad Hasid has with the Rebbe is called \"hiskashrus\". Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn stated, \"A bond with me (\"hiskashrus\") is made by studying my ma'amorim of Hasidut, by fulfilling my request concerning the daily recital of Tehillim, and the like.\"\n\nIn a continuation of longstanding Chabad tradition, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson demanded that each individual exert themselves in advancing spiritually, and \"not\" rely on the Rebbe to do it for them.\n\n\"Sefer HaTanya\", Shneur Zalman's magnum opus, is the first schematic treatment of Hasidic moral philosophy and its metaphysical foundations. The original name of the first book is \"Sefer Shel Beinonim\", the \"Book of the Intermediates.\" It is also known as \"Likutei Amarim\" — \"Collected Sayings.\" \"Sefer Shel Beinonim\" analyzes the inner struggle of the individual and the path to resolution. Citing the biblical verse \"the matter is very near to you, in your mouth, your heart, to do\", the philosophy is based on the notion that the human is not inherently evil; rather, every individual has an inner conflict that is characterized with two different inclinations, the good and the bad.\n\nSome have argued that Shneur Zalman's moderation and synthesis saved the general Hasidic movement from breaking away from Orthodox Judaism. It allowed for mystically inclined Hasidim to be familiarized with traditional Jewish scholarship and observance, and for traditionalists to access Hasidism within the framework of Jewish scholarship.\n\n\"Likutei Torah/Torah Or\" is a compilation of Chassidic treatises by the first Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. The treatises are arranged according to the Weekly Torah portion, and are studied regularly by Chabad Chassidim.\n\n\"Toras Chaim\" is a two volume work of Hasidic discourses on the books of Genesis and Exodus by the second Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Dovber Schneuri. The work is arranged in a similar fashion as \"Likutei Torah/Torah Or\" following the weekly Torah portion. The treatises in \"Toras Chaim\" are noted for their length and depth.\n\n\"Imrei Binah\" is a work by Rabbi Dovber Schneuri considered to be one of the most profound texts in Chabad philosophy. The central themes discussed in \"Imrei Binah\" are the Hasidic explanations for the commandment of the reading the Shema and donning the Tefillin.\n\n\"Sefer Hamamaarim Taf Resh Samech Vav\" (), is a compilation of the Chasidic treatises by Rabbi Shalom Dovber Schneersohn, the Rebbe Rashab, from the Hebrew year 5666 (1905–06). This series of Chassidic essays are considered a fundamental work of Chabad mysticism.\n\n\"Sefer Hamamaarim Taf Resh Ayin Beis\" (), is a compilation of the Chasidic treatises by Rabbi Shalom Dovber Schneersohn, the Rebbe Rashab, from the Hebrew year 5672 (1911–12). This series of Chassidic essays are considered a fundamental work of Chabad mysticism.\n\nThe talks or \"Sichos\" of the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, contain a wealth of commentary on Chabad Hassidic thought. Major compilations of these talks include:\n\nOther major texts of Chabad philosophy include:\n\nChabad \"Maamarim/Ma'amorim\" (, lit. \"discourses\", singular \"Maamar\" ) are the collective term for the essays and treatises of Hasidic thought written by the Chabad Rebbes. While the more often studied series of Maamarim go by the particular name of the series, lesser known treatises are either referred to as \"a Maamer by-\" a particular Rabbe of Chabad or as \"Maamarim from the year...\".\n\n\"Hayom Yom\" (, \"Today is day ...\") is a short work compiled by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at the behest of his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. The book is formatted as a calendar for the Hebrew year of 5703 (1942–43). The calendar contains a number of Chassidic insights and customs and is read by many Chabad members on a daily basis.\n\n\n\"Toward a Meaningful Life\" is an English-language best-selling book on Chabad philosophy written by Simon Jacobson. The book distils Chassidic ideas and translates them into contemporary English. The book has sold over 300,000 copies and has been translated into a number of languages.\n\n\"Bringing Heaven Down to Earth\" is a book written by Rabbi Tzvi Freeman, a writer and editor for Chabad.org. Freeman's book transcribes the teachings of Chabad philosophy as short \"meditations\". The book contains 365 such meditations.\n\nA number of scholarly journals have been published by the Chabad movement; journal articles often cover topics in Chabad philosophy.

{"id": "1808630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808630", "title": "Collective responsibility", "text": "Collective responsibility\n\nCollective responsibility refers to responsibilities of organizations, groups and societies. By which individuals who are part of such collectives to be responsible for other people's actions and occurrences by tolerating, ignoring, or harboring them, without actively engaging. For Arendt it varies from collective guilt as guilt is a personal and self indulgent emotion. Instead it is a call to action to take responsibility for the actions a government takes out in your name as a citizen.\n\nThis concept is found in the Old Testament (or Tanakh), some examples include the account of the Flood, the Tower of Babel, Sodom and Gomorrah and in some interpretations, the Book of Joshua's Achan. In those records entire communities were punished on the act of the vast majority of their members, however it is impossible to state that there were no innocent people, or children too young to be responsible for their deeds.\n\nThe practice of blaming the Jews for Jesus' death is the longest example of collective responsibility. In this case, the blame was cast not only on the Jews of the time but upon successive generations. This comes from Matthew 27:25-66 New International Version (NIV) 25: \"All the people answered, 'His blood is on us and on our children!'\"\n\nCollective responsibility in the form of collective punishment is often used as a disciplinary measure in closed institutions, e.g. boarding schools (punishing a whole class for the actions of one known or unknown pupil), military units, prisons (juvenile and adult), psychiatric facilities, etc. The effectiveness and severity of this measure may vary greatly, but it often breeds distrust and isolation among their members. Historically, collective punishment is a sign of authoritarian tendencies in the institution or its home society. For example, in the Soviet Gulags, all members of a \"brigada\" (work unit) were punished for bad performance of any of its members.\n\nCollective punishment is also practiced in situation of war, economic sanctions, etc., presupposing the existence of collective guilt. Collective guilt, or guilt by association, is the controversial collectivist idea that individuals who are identified as a member of a certain group carry the responsibility for an act or behavior that members of that group have demonstrated, even if they themselves were not involved. Contemporary systems of criminal law accept the principle that guilt shall only be personal. Others view groups as being entities in themselves (an entitative group), capable of holding guilt or responsibility independent of any of the group's members. The mass shootings of Nicholas II's family in 1918 may be regarded as an example of such an approach.\n\nTerror groups of all kinds bomb civilians who are seen as collectively responsible for the acts of their leaders. The state level bombing of civilians became popular in the Twentieth Century although ancient warriors would often slaughter whole cities if they resisted demands for capitulation or tribute. \n\nDuring the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Germans applied collective responsibility: any kind of help given to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death, and that not only for the rescuer but also for his/her family. This was widely publicized by the Germans. During the occupation, for every German killed by a Pole, 100-400 Poles were shot in retribution. Communities were held collectively responsible for the purported Polish counter-attacks against the invading German troops. Mass executions of \"łapanka\" hostages were conducted every single day during the Wehrmacht advance across Poland in September 1939 and thereafter.\n\nAnother example is when after the war, ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe were held collectively responsible for Nazi crimes, resulting in numerous atrocities against the German population, including killings (see Expulsion of Germans after World War II and Beneš decrees).\n\nAs the business practices known as corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability mature and converge with the responsibilities of governments and citizens, the term \"collective responsibility\" is beginning to be more widely used.\n\nCollective responsibility is widely applied in corporations, where the entire workforce is held responsible for failure to achieve corporate targets (for example, profit targets), irrespective of the performance of individuals or teams which may have achieved or overachieved within their area. Collective punishment, even including measures that actually further harm the prospect of achieving targets, is applied as a measure to 'teach' the workforce.\n\nThe concept of collective responsibility is present in literature, most notably in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", a poem telling the tale of a ship's crew who died of thirst because they approved of one crew member's killing of an albatross.\n\n1959's \"Ben-Hur\" and 1983's prison crime drama \"Bad Boys\" depict collective responsibility and punishment.\nThe play 'An Inspector Calls' by J.B Priestley also features the theme of collective responsibility throughout the investigation process.\n\nIn ethics, both methodological individualists and normative individualists question the validity of collective responsibility.\n\"Methodological individualists challenge the very possibility of associating moral agency with groups, as distinct from their individual members, and normative individualists argue that collective responsibility violates principles of both individual responsibility and fairness\". (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) \n\nNormally, only the individual actor can accrue culpability for actions that they freely cause. The notion of collective culpability seems to deny individual moral responsibility. Does collective responsibility make sense? History is filled with examples of a wronged man who tried to avenge himself, not only on the person who has wronged him, but on other members of the wrongdoer's family, tribe, ethnic group, religion, or nation.\n\n"}
{"id": "411659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411659", "title": "Courtship", "text": "Courtship\n\nCourtship is the period of development towards an intimate relationship wherein a couple get to know each other and decide if there will be an engagement. A courtship may be an informal and private matter between two people or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with family approval. Traditionally, in the case of a formal engagement, it has been perceived that it is the role of a male to actively \"court\" or \"woo\" a female, thus encouraging her to understand him and her receptiveness to a proposal of marriage.\n\nThe average duration of courtship varies considerably throughout the world. Furthermore, there is vast individual variation between couples. Courtship may be completely omitted, as in cases of some arranged marriages where the couple do not meet before the wedding.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a poll of 3,000 engaged or married couples resulted in an average duration between first meeting and accepted proposal of marriage of 2 years and 11 months, with the women feeling ready to accept at an average of 2 years and 7 months. Regarding duration between proposal and wedding, the UK poll above gave an average of 2 years and 3 months.\n\nThe date is fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, but in some traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity, with very specific formal rules.\n\nIn some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners and then allow limited dating to determine whether the parties are suited. In Japan, there is a such type of courtship called Omiai, with similar practices called \"Xiangqin\" (相親) in the Greater China Area. Parents will hire a matchmaker to provide pictures and résumés of potential mates, and if the couple agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often parents in attendance. The matchmaker and parents will often exert pressure on the couple to decide whether they want to marry or not after a few dates.\n\nCourtship in the Philippines is one known complex form of courtship. Unlike what is regularly seen in other societies, it takes a far more subdued and indirect approach. It is complex in that it involves stages, and it is considered normal for courtship to last a year or longer. It is common to see the male showing off by sending love letters and love poems, singing romantic songs, and buying gifts for the female. The parents are also seen as part of the courtship practice, as their approval is commonly needed before courtship may begin or before the female gives the male an answer to his advances.\n\nIn more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated altogether by the practice of arranged marriages in which partners are chosen for young people, typically by their parents. Forbidding experimental and serial courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family interests, which, in such cultures, may be considered more important than individual romantic preferences.\n\nThroughout history, courtship has often included traditions such as exchanging valentines, written correspondence (which was facilitated by the creation of the postal service in the nineteenth century), and similar communication-based courting. Over recent decades, though, the concept of arranged marriage has changed or simply been mixed with other forms of dating, including Eastern and Indian ones; potential couples have the opportunity to meet and date each other before one decides on whether or not to continue the relationship.\n\nIn the earlier 1800s, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner, rather than for social reasons. In more traditional forms of Christianity, this concept of courtship has been retained, with John Piper defining courtship and distinguishing this concept from dating, stating that:\n\nChristian minister Patricia Bootsma delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in \"courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors\". She further states that with courtship, \"commitment happens before intimacy\".\n\nIn America, in the 1820s, the phrase \"date\" was most closely associated with prostitution. However, by the Jazz Age of the 1920s, dating for fun was becoming a cultural expectation, and by the 1930s, it was assumed that any popular young person would have lots of dates. This form of dating, though, was usually more chaste than is seen today, since premarital sex was not considered the norm.\n\nCourtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and sexual identity. Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern dating practices and norms. Both Moore and Perper found that, contrary to popular beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women, driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours to which men respond.\n\nThis is generally supported by other theorists who specialise in the study of body language. There are some feminist scholars, however, who regard courtship as a socially constructed (and male-led) process organised to subjugate women. Farrell reports, for example, that magazines about marriage and romantic fiction continue to attract a 98% female readership. Systematic research into courtship processes inside the workplace as well two 10-year studies examining norms in different international settings continue to support a view that courtship is a social process that socialises both sexes into accepting forms of relationship that maximise the chances of successfully raising children.\n\nCourtship in Australia is generally reserved to those with religious affiliation. As a standard rule, dating is widely accepted; along with inter-racial relationships, gay/lesbian relationships, pre-marital sex and abortion. A lot of the Australian values are derived from British courtship culture; therefore, marriage practices are much the same. Modern western culture has taken over, leading to more and more people committing to partnerships through dating. Before entering marriage, a lot of Australian couples like to live with each other to get an idea of what married life would be like. This would not happen in a courtship as both people vow to chastity and often like to keep a chaperone around.\n\nAs technology progressed the dating world followed. In a Time-line by Metro, a statistic match-making business opened in 1941, the first reality TV dating show was developed in 1965 and by the 1980s the public was introduced to video dating. Video Dating was a way for singles to sit in front of a camera and tell whomever may be watching something about themselves. The process of elimination was significant because now the viewer was able hear their voice, see their face and watch their body language to determine a physical attraction to the candidates.\n\nIn online dating, individuals create profiles where they disclose personal information, photographs, hobbies, interests, religion and expectations. Then the user can search through hundreds of thousands of accounts and connect with multiple people at once which in return, gives the user more options and more opportunity to find what meets their standards. Online dating has influenced the idea of choice. In \"\", Aziz Ansari states that one third of marriages in the United States between 2005-2012 met through online dating services. Today there are hundreds of sites to choose from and websites designed to fit specific needs such as Match, Eharmony, Okcupid, Zoosk, and Christianmingle. Mobile apps, such as Grindr and Tinder allow users to upload profiles that are then judged by others on the service; one can either swipe right on a profile (indicating interest) or swipe left (which presents another possible mate).\n\nMany animal species have mate-selection rituals also referred to as \"courtship\" anthropomorphically. Animal courtship may involve complicated dances or touching, vocalizations, or displays of beauty or fighting prowess. Most animal courtship occurs out of sight of humans and so it is often the least documented of animal behaviors. One animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the bower bird whose male builds a \"bower\" of collected objects.\n\nFrom the scientific point of view, courtship in the animal kingdom is the process in which the different species select their partners for reproduction purposes. Generally speaking, the male initiates the courtship and the female chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his \"performance\".\n\nAll animals have different courtship rituals that reflect fitness, compatibility with others and ability to provide. Sea turtles court during a limited receptive time. During the courtship males will either\nnuzzle the females head to show affection or by gently biting the back of her\nneck. This may go on for long periods of time depending on if the female\nresponds to the male. If the female does respond, by not fleeing, the male will\nattach himself onto the back of the female’s shell using his front flippers. He\nwill stretch his long tail under the back of the females shell to begin\ncopulation.\n\nCourting can be competitive among males. The male\nthat has better endurance will win the female. To a female, endurance is a great\ntrait to be passed on to their offspring, the higher the endurance in the male\nthe higher the endurance will be in her offspring and the more likely they will\nbe to survive. Female Leatherback sea turtles will also choose many different\nmales to copulate with in order to diversify their offspring since it is known\nthat Leatherback sea turtles have female-biased offspring.\n\nHippopotamus are commonly misconceived as being\naggressive animals, when in actuality the mothers are very nurturing and\nsensitive. Mating and birth both occur in the water for hippopotamus. This\nbecause it gives them privacy when conceiving and it helps conserve energy\nduring birth. The female hippo normally averages around 5–6 years while males\nare average an age of 7-8. During mating season the male hippopotamus will find\na mate out of the herd, showing interest by smelling the female’s dorsal end. As\nlong as the male acts submissive during courting season the adults in the herd\nwill not interfere. Once the male finds the female he wants to mate with, he\nbegins provoking the female. He then will push the female into the water and\nmounts her. In order to alert the herd or other animals that may be lurking\naround the male will let a loud wheezing sound. Preceding birth the female\nexhibits aggressive behavior leaving the herd until after the birth of the\ncalf. Although hippopotamus can mate anytime of the year, the mating season\nranges from February to August. Because the energy cost is high, the female\ngenerally only has one offspring in a two years span.\n\nThe courtship behaviour of honey bees follows through two distinct types:\nApiary Vicinity Mating and Drone Assembly Mating respectively. Apiary vicinity\nmating usually takes place in weather that is cool and is more local to the\napiary from which the queen resides. The drones are in the same\napiary too but do not mean that it will lead to inbreeding. Drones assemble in\na bulb of warm air close or far from the apiary. They are alert when the queen\nhas flown out of the hive and will follow her route. This is followed by a sort\nof fast hum or buzz in the general bee population that follows an upward\ntemperature gradient. The male drone mounts on the virgin queen and inserts\nhis endophallus, ejaculating semen. The male honey bee will then pull away from the queen, but his endophallus will be ripped from his body and remain attached to the newly fertilized queen. The next male honey bee will remove the endophallus that was previously left by the other male honey bee and will eventually ejaculate and lose his own. The frequency of mating for the male\nhoney bees is seven to 10 times during a mating flight. Most of the drones die\nquickly immediately after mating, and their abdomen rips open since the\nendophallus has been removed. The few that survive are usually ejected from\ntheir nests, as they have served their sole purpose by mating .\n\nThey only attend one mating flight\nand queen stores up to 100 million sperm within her oviducts during this\nflight, but only five to six million are stored in the spermatheca of the\nqueen. Only a few of this sperm are used by the queen at a time to fertilize\nthe eggs throughout her life. New queen generations will mate and produce their\ncolonies if the queen runs out of sperm in her lifetime. The sex of the\noffspring is controlled by the honey bee queens as the eggs passing through the\noviduct can be determined whether they are fertilized or not by the queen. Research has indicated that eggs that are fertilized develop into female workers and queens while the unfertilized eggs become drone honey bees. Female workers can lay infertile eggs but do not mate. The infertile eggs become male honey bees. The eggs of the queen are laid in oval-shaped structural cells that usually stick to the nest ceiling. Royal jelly is then filled with these cells to prevent larvae from falling. Soon-to-be workers are fed royal jelly during the first two days. The future queens are given royal jelly throughout the entire larval period. Each member colony development depends on\ncaste. For proper growth from eggs to adult, the male honey bees need 24 days,\n21 for workers and only 16 for the queens.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10837", "title": "Faith and rationality", "text": "Faith and rationality\n\nFaith and rationality are two ideologies that exist in varying degrees of conflict or compatibility. Rationality is based on reason or facts. Faith is belief in inspiration, revelation, or authority. The word \"faith\" sometimes refers to a belief that is held with lack of reason or evidence, a belief that is held in spite of or against reason or evidence, or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant.\n\nAlthough the words \"faith\" and \"belief\" are sometimes erroneously conflated and used as synonyms, \"faith\" properly refers to a particular type (or subset) of \"belief,\" as defined above.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two categories of views regarding the relationship between faith and rationality:\n\nThe Catholic Church also has taught that true faith and correct reason can and must work together, and, viewed properly, can never be in conflict with one another, as both have their origin in God, as stated in the Papal encyclical letter issued by Pope John Paul II, \"Fides et Ratio\" (\"[On] Faith and Reason\").\n\nFrom at least the days of the Greek Philosophers, the relationship between faith and reason has been hotly debated. Plato argued that knowledge is simply memory of the eternal. Aristotle set down rules by which knowledge could be discovered by reason.\n\nRationalists point out that many people hold irrational beliefs, for many reasons. There may be evolutionary causes for irrational beliefs — irrational beliefs may increase our ability to survive and reproduce. Or, according to Pascal's Wager, it may be to our advantage to have faith, because faith may promise infinite rewards, while the rewards of reason are seen by many as finite. One more reason for irrational beliefs can perhaps be explained by operant conditioning. For example, in one study by B. F. Skinner in 1948, pigeons were awarded grain at regular time intervals regardless of their behaviour. The result was that each of pigeons developed their own idiosyncratic response which had become associated with the consequence of receiving grain.\n\nBelievers in faith — for example those who believe salvation is possible through faith alone — frequently suggest that everyone holds beliefs arrived at by faith, not reason. The belief that the universe is a sensible place and that our minds allow us to arrive at correct conclusions about it, is a belief we hold through faith. Rationalists contend that this is arrived at because they have observed the world being consistent and sensible, not because they have faith that it is.\n\nBeliefs held \"by faith\" may be seen existing in a number of relationships to rationality:\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, the most important doctor of the Catholic Church, was the first to write a full treatment of the relationship, differences, and similarities between faith—an intellectual assent—and reason, predominately in his \"Summa Theologica\", \"De Veritate\", and \"Summa contra Gentiles\".\n\nThe Council of Trent's catechism—the \"Roman Catechism\", written during the Catholic Church's Counter-Reformation to combat Protestantism and Martin Luther's antimetaphysical tendencies.\n\n\"Dei Filius\" was a dogmatic constitution of the First Vatican Council on the Roman Catholic faith. It was adopted unanimously on 24 April 1870 and was influenced by the philosophical conceptions of Johann Baptist Franzelin, who had written a great deal on the topic of faith and rationality.\n\nBecause the Roman Catholic Church does not disparage reason, but rather affirms its veracity and utility, there have been many Catholic scientists over the ages.\n\nTwentieth-century Thomist philosopher Étienne Gilson wrote about faith and reason in his 1922 book \"Le Thomisme\". His contemporary Jacques Maritain wrote about it in his \"The Degrees of Knowledge\".\n\n\"Fides et Ratio\" is an encyclical promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 14 September 1998. It deals with the relationship between faith and reason.\n\nPope Benedict XVI's 12 September 2006 Regensburg Lecture was about faith and reason.\n\nSome have asserted that Martin Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship however has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each understand. Bernhard Lohse for example has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides Und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently Hans-Peter Großhans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Bibilical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible be reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible make sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than Reason which for Luther denoted science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a differing picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.\n\nThe view that faith underlies all rationality holds that rationality is dependent on faith for its coherence. Under this view, there is no way to comprehensively \"prove\" that we are actually seeing what we appear to be seeing, that what we remember actually happened, or that the laws of logic and mathematics are actually real. Instead, all beliefs depend for their coherence on \"faith\" in our senses, memory, and reason, because the foundations of rationalism cannot be proven by evidence or reason. Rationally, you can not prove anything you see is real, but you can prove that you yourself are real, and rationalist belief would be that you can believe that the world is consistent until something demonstrates inconsistency. This differs from faith based belief, where you believe that your world view is consistent no matter what inconsistencies the world has with your beliefs.\n\nIn this view, there are many beliefs that are held by faith alone, that rational thought would force the mind to reject. As an example, many people believe in the Biblical story of Noah's flood: that the entire Earth was covered by water for forty days. But objected that most plants cannot survive being covered by water for that length of time, a boat of that magnitude could not have been built by wood, and there would be no way for two of every animal to survive on that ship and migrate back to their place of origin. (such as penguins), Although Christian apologists offer answers to these and such issues, under the premise that such responses are insufficient, then one must choose between accepting the story on faith and rejecting reason, or rejecting the story by reason and thus rejecting faith.\n\nWithin the rationalist point of view, there remains the possibility of multiple rational explanations. For example, considering the biblical story of Noah's flood, one making rational determinations about the probability of the events does so via interpretation of modern evidence. Two observers of the story may provide different plausible explanations for the life of plants, construction of the boat, species living at the time, and migration following the flood. Some see this as meaning that a person is not strictly bound to choose between faith and reason.\n\nAmerican biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson stated that the Greek word \"pistis\" used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered \"assurance\" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is \"an old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.\" Likewise Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means \"to be persuaded.\"\n\nIn contrast to faith meaning blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence, Alister McGrath quotes Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas, (1861-1924), who states faith is \"not blind, but intelligent\" and \"commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...\", which McGrath sees as \"a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith.\"\n\nAlvin Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source of truth claims, but although it may involve this, he sees faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. \"Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.\"\n\nThe 14th Century Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gerson tried to reconcile faith and reason. He wrote, \"The Torah cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to believe.\" His contemporary Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas argued the contrary view, that reason is weak and faith strong, and that only through faith can we discover the fundamental truth that God is love, that through faith alone can we endure the suffering that is the common lot of God's chosen people.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He attended a gymnasium in Jarosław, but because of his involvement in organizing meetings in favor of Polish independence, he was expelled by the Austrian authorities, and had to finish his secondary education at a school in Sanok, in 1903.\n\nMłynarski finished the Jagiellonian University in Poland. As a youth, he was active in the \"endecja\" movement, but broke ranks with it prior to World War I due to its leader Roman Dmowski's pro-Russian orientation. In 1914 he joined Polish Legions, and spent some time in the United States recruiting members for the Legions from among the American Polonia.\n\nAfter the war he joined the newly formed government of the Second Polish Republic. In the years 1921–1923 he directed the Emigration Office. From 1923 he was employed at the Ministry of Finance, and the following year he became the director of the Currency Department of the Ministry. He took part in the Grabski Monetary Reform of 1924, which ended hyperinflation in interwar Poland and was a co-creator of the (second) Bank of Poland for which he served as vice-president between September 1924 and September 1924. In the years 1925–1927 he helped negotiated several economic agreements between Poland and the United States. He fell out of favor with the \"sanacja\" government of Józef Piłsudski and resigned from governmental positions in 1929. In the 1930s he taught at the Warsaw Trade Academy, and consulted for the League of Nations on currency issues.\n\nDuring World War II he became, with the approval of the Polish Government in exile, the president of the German operated Bank of Issue in Poland. As a result, the currency notes used during the occupation were popularly known as \"Młynarki\", after him.\n\nAfter the war, in 1945, he became a member of the Polish Academy of Science in People's Republic of Poland. Between 1945 and 1948 he taught at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. His war time collaboration with the Germans, even through approved by the Polish underground government of that time, cast a shadow on his career, and resulted in refusal to grant him a professorship position. He also served as the director of the library of Cracow University of Economics.\n\nMłynarski authored numerous works from the fields of economy, sociology and philosophy.\n\nIn his 1929 book \"Gold and Central Banks\" Młynarski identified a fundamental instability in a gold-based international monetary system: the reserve currency countries would tend to accumulate foreign reserves, but as the volume of these grew relative to the country's gold reserves, international investors would begin to fear suspension of convertibility. The resulting outflow of reserves could create significant worldwide deflationary pressures and possibly lead to the collapse of the gold-based system. After World War II, the same problem was identified by the Belgian economist Robert Triffin, but in relation to the Bretton Woods system and became known as the Triffin dilemma. Due to Młynarski's precedence in articulating the problem, Barry Eichengreen has suggested renaming the problem to \"the Młynarski dilemma\".\n\nIn English:\n\nRafał Łętocha, Nacjonalizm liberalny Feliksa Młynarskiego [w:] Nacjonalizmy różnych narodów.

{"id": "12875733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12875733", "title": "Hayashi Gahō", "text": "Hayashi Gahō\n\n, also known as Hayashi Shunsai, was a Japanese Neo-Confucian scholar, teacher and administrator in the system of higher education maintained by the Tokugawa \"bakufu\" during the Edo period. He was a member of the Hayashi clan of Confucian scholars.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, Hayashi Razan, Gahō (formerly Harukatsu) would devote a lifetime to expressing and disseminating the official neo-Confucian doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate. Like his distinguished father, Gahō's teaching and scholarly written work emphasized Neo-Confucianist virtues and order.\n\nGahō became the unofficial rector of what would become Edo’s Confucian Academy, the Shōhei-kō (afterwards known as the Yushima Seidō). This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the Tokugawa shogunate. Gahō's hereditary title was \"Daigaku-no-kami,\" which, in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as \"head of the state university.\"\n\nIn the elevated context his father engendered, Gahō worked on editing a chronicle of Japanese emperors compiled in conformance with his father's principles. \"Nihon Ōdai Ichiran\" grew into a seven-volume text which was completed in 1650. Gahō himself was accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period; but the potent Shōhei-kō and Hayashi family links to the work’s circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity. Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this summary drawn from historical records.\n\nThe narrative of \"Nihon Ōdai Ichiran\" stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime. Gahō's text did not continue up through his present day; rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler. Gahō modestly observed that \"in a book intended for the shogun's eyes, it is incumbent upon one to be circumspect.\" This book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, \"perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials.\"\n\nGahō would become his father's successor as advisor to the shogun. He was, in his lifetime, the Tokugawa shogunate's chief scholar. After Razan's death, Gahō finished work his father had begun, including a number of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history. In 1665, Gahō published an anthology of historical poems (\"Honchō Ichinin Isshu\"). In 1670, the Hayashi family's scholarly reputation was burnished when Gahō published the 310 volumes of .\n\nTogether with his brother, Hayashi Dokkōsai (formerly Morikatsu), Gahō compiled, edited and posthumously published selections from their father's body of writings:\n\nGahō's son, Hayashi Hōkō (formerly Nobuatsu), would eventually inherit the position as head of the Shōhei-kō or Yushima Seidō, as well as the honorific \"Daigaku-no kami;\" and his progeny would continue the Hayashi traditions.\n\nIn January 1858, it would be the hereditary \"Daigaku-no-kami\" descendant of Hayashi Razan and Hayashi Gahō who would head the bakufu delegation which sought advice from the emperor in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers. This would have been the first time the Emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. The most easily identified consequence of this transitional overture would be the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade. There is no small irony in the fact that this 19th-century scholar/bureaucrat would find himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change—moving arguably \"by the book\" through uncharted waters with well-settled theories as the only guide.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35195529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35195529", "title": "International religious freedom caucus", "text": "International religious freedom caucus\n\nThe Congressional International Religious Freedom (IRF) Caucus is a bi-partisan group of nearly 60 members of the United States Congress who address religious persecution for people of any or no faith based on Article 18 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. The IRF Caucus has always addressed religious freedom within the broader context of human rights in the spirit of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA). The Caucus plays a critical role in raising the profile of numerous religious freedom issues in Congress and with both the Bush and Obama Administrations, and led to the release of many individuals imprisoned for their faith and ensures relief for many suffering under religious persecution.\n\nThe IRF Caucus was established on the belief that, by ensuring that Congress proactively promotes greater respect for religious freedom in American policy with foreign governments, individuals throughout the world would experience greater freedom and dignity with respect to other rights that closely intertwine with the freedom of religion. Indeed, states that actively ensure the freedom of religion benefit from greater political stability, economic prosperity, and social harmony, and in turn create greater international peace.\n\nEstablished in 2006 by bipartisan co-founders Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona, and Emanuel Cleaver, II, a Democrat from Missouri, the Caucus has worked to ensure that this freedom, which was so foundational to America's democratic history, remains a priority in United States foreign policy, development, and refugee law. With nearly 60 members, the Caucus enjoys broad bipartisan and multi-faith support as it highlights ways to ensure greater respect for an individual's freedom of religious belief throughout the world. In doing so, the Caucus utilizes international standards as a basis for defining an individual's right to freedom of religious belief, including Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states:\n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\n\nThe Caucus has been an important vehicle for the coordination of religious freedom advocacy in Congress, enabling Members to learn about and become more involved in engaging on this important issue. Over the coming months, we will continue to coordinate any issues members are interested in by hosting briefings, raising cases, coordinating sign-on letters, and discussing strategies for influencing greater respect for religious freedom in US foreign policy.\n\nIn the past, the Caucus has held several public hearings on the religious freedom situation in countries such as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, North Korea, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkey, and Vietnam. In addition, the Caucus has raised dozens of specific cases of persecution in urgent need of attention with foreign governments. Most recently, the Caucus coordinated efforts to secure the release of individuals imprisoned for their faith or human rights activities, including Sayed Mussa in Afghanistan and Kareem Abdul Soleiman Amer in Egypt, the safety and asylum of persecuted individuals, and the defeat of the \"defamation of religions\" resolution at the United Nations.\n\nThe co-chairs for the International Religious Freedom Caucus are Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona, and Heath Shuler, a Democrat from North Carolina.\n"}

After travelling, in 1806 he became professor of philosophy and elementary mathematics at the University of Heidelberg.\n\nThough the progress of his psychological thought compelled him to abandon the positive theology of the Moravians, he retained an appreciation of its spiritual or symbolic significance. His philosophical position with regard to his contemporaries had already been made clear in his critical work \"Reinhold, Fichte und Schelling\" (1803), and in the more systematic treatises \"System der Philosophie als evidente Wissenschaft\" (1804) and \"Wissen, Glaube und Ahnung\" (1805).\n\nFries' most important treatise, the \"Neue oder anthropologische Kritik der Vernunft\" (2nd ed., 1828–1831), was an attempt to give a new foundation of psychological analysis to the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant. In 1811 he published his \"System der Logik\" (ed. 1819 and 1837), and in 1814 \"Julius und Evagoras\", a philosophical romance. He was also involved in public polemics, and in 1816 wrote \"Ueber die Gefährdung des Wohlstandes und des Charakters der Deutschen durch die Juden\" (\"On the Danger Posed by the Jews to German Well-Being and Character\"), advocating among other things a distinct sign on the dress of Jews to distinguish them from the general population, and encouraging their emigration from German lands. He blamed the Jews for the ascendant role of money in society and called for Judaism to be \"extirpated root and branch\" from German society.\n\nIn 1816 he was invited to Jena to fill the chair of theoretical philosophy (including mathematics, physics, and philosophy proper), and entered upon a crusade against the prevailing Romanticism. In politics he was a strong Liberal and Unionist, and he did much to inspire the organization of the Burschenschaft. He also published a pamphlet calling for the exclusion of the Jews from public life in Germany. In 1816 he had published his views in a brochure, \"Von deutschem Bund und deutscher Staatsverfassung\", dedicated to \"the youth of Germany\", and his influence gave a powerful impetus to the agitation which led in 1819 to the issue of the Carlsbad Decrees by the representatives of the German governments.\n\nKarl Sand, the murderer of August von Kotzebue, was one of Fries's pupils; and a letter of his, found on another student, warning Sand against participation in secret societies, was twisted by the suspicious authorities into evidence of Fries' conspiracy. He was condemned by the Mainz Commission; the Grand Duke of Weimar was compelled to deprive him of his professorship; and he was forbidden to lecture on philosophy. The grand duke, however, continued to pay him his stipend, and in 1824 he was recalled to Jena as professor of mathematics and physics, receiving permission also to lecture on philosophy in his own rooms to a select number of students. Finally, in 1838, the unrestricted right of lecturing was restored to him.\n\nFries was involved in a dispute with the contemporary German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel. In the preface to his \"Philosophy of Right\", Hegel criticised Fries' participation in student events and his role in the \"Burschenschaft\". In Hegel's view, Fries was dependent upon \"immediate perception and contingent imagination\"; his views were emotional rather than rational. Hegel argued that Fries' methodology was not sufficiently scientific and that, therefore, his conclusions were illogical. Fries responded by accusing Hegel of defending the existing order and his own privileged position within it. He argued that \"Hegel's metaphysical mushroom has grown not in the gardens of science but on the dunghill of servility.\" For Fries, Hegel's theories merely added up to a defence of the establishment and, specifically, the Prussian authorities.\n\nThe most important of the many works written during his Jena professorship are:\n\n\n\n"}

As such, the retreat is a four-day, three-night (or three-day, two-night in some cases) residential retreat, with the aim of providing participants the chance to \"contemplate God's role in their lives\".\n\nIt was first held in 1965, and under its current name since 1979. It is conceptually based in Ignatian spirituality, as put forth in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola.\nKairos retreats are organized by hundreds of Catholic high schools in the United States, especially Jesuit schools, and they are also offered by certain schools in Australia, Ireland, Britain, Canada and Switzerland (in English and French).\n\nThe Kairos retreat program is based on the Cursillo retreat program and was developed in 1965 by the Diocese of Brooklyn, in the United States. A team of priests, brothers, and lay people under the direction of Fr. Douglas L. Brown of the Brooklyn Diocese made use of the Cursillo Retreat format, which has its roots in Ignatian spirituality, but adapted it for older teenagers. \n\nThe retreat was immediately successful and within three years it was adopted in Connecticut, California, Arizona, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Texas, Virginia, Kentucky, Washington D.C. and eventually Michigan and Wisconsin. \n\nIn December, 1975, Fr. Bob Colaresi, O.Carm, from Joliet Catholic High School, further developed the program and made a retreat that was first called \"Chiros\" by Fr. Kevin McBrien. In March 1979, it was properly spelled Kairos. By 1995 the program had spread to 21 Jesuit high schools throughout the United States and dozens of others including Capuchin, Lasallian, Dominican, Carmelite, Franciscan and several other orders.\n\nThe retreat is usually led mostly by the peers of the participants. \n\nStudents who have been on the retreat typically come back with a better sense of the world and are more inclined to share their faith with others.\n\nThe team is composed of student leaders who have already been on the retreat and a few faculty from the school. Generally, each Kairos is headed by a student or recent graduate Rector who is responsible for the overall retreat experience and guides the leaders in creating the retreat.\n\nThe specificity of the Kairos retreat is that it focuses mostly on helping one find his or her own personal relationship with God during a few days of discerning and discovery. Through the course of the retreat, the building of a strong community takes place, as there is a strong focus on the concepts of confidentiality and trust within the small groups and the entire retreat group as well.\n\nKairos retreats are often held at retreat houses removed from the hustle and bustle of mainstream society. With this concept in mind, the leaders of many Kairos retreats often request that the retreatants hand in their cell phones and other electronic devices, so that they can be more fully immersed in the experience.\n\n"}

He has made contributions to a wide range of topics in philosophy of education, Religion and personal construct psychology; topics from different viewpoints, such as constructive realism, neo-Pragmatism, action theory, deconstruction, Hermeneutics, and Islamic philosophy of education. In 2011 he was awarded First order Medal of Research (The Distinguished Researcher) by the University of Tehran.\n\nIn his book \"Islamic Education\" he places human agency as the main educational thesis of Islam. This is while before him scholars such as Mutahari believed in human nature as the center of Islamic education. He opposes nature as a central key to Islamic education claiming that human beings are not a piece of non-living object to be fabricated into a human being. Instead human is a dynamic creature who should choose being religious. in this regard he has introduced abstinence by presence. While most scholars have insisted that religion is about preventing sinful situations Bagheri insists that real education leads to presence in a sinful situation and yet remaining intact.\n\nHe argues that in George Kelly's personal construct psychology a combination of correspondence theory of truth and a coherence theory of truth is necessary. offering criteria for a reconciliation of correspondence and coherence theories he argues that constructivism should be based on a reality and the effort is to search for an optimal point where reality and constructs reach each other. \n\nMost Classic Islamic Philosophers believed in a naive realism or intuition based theories for achieving knowledge from the external world. Either of these perspectives or a combination of them has led some to conclude that a science based on religion can lead to infallible knowledge. However, Bagheri argues that a religious science is only possible through interference of religious elements in the presupposition of a theory and hence will remain a science tout court, and its religious presuppositions will not guarantee an infallible knowledge.\nA non-comprehensive list of Bagheri's published works include:\n\n\nBagheri has translated the following books into Persian:\n\n"}

He authored several books on monarchism, Orthodoxy, and Russian political philosophy.\n\nLev Tikhomirov was born in Gelendzhik on January 19, 1852, to a military doctor and his wife, a graduate of the Institute for the Education of Noble Maidens. Despite receiving a conservative education, he came under the influence of radical ideas and became involved in the Narodniki movement. In 1873, Tikhomirov was arrested in connection with the Trial of the 193 and sentenced to a four-year term in St Petersburg's Sts Peter and Paul Fortress.\nBy 1878, Tikhomirov became one of the leaders of the Land and Liberty organization. In August 1879, when Land and Liberty split into two factions as the result of a dispute over organizational tactics, he joined its most radical of the two successors, the People's Will.\n\nIn 1882, following the assassination of Emperor Alexander II, Tikhomirov emigrated to Switzerland and then to France. In France, however, he began to reconsider his views writing in 1886:\n\nFrom henceforth our only hope is Russia and the Russian people. We have nothing to gain from the revolutionaries ... In light of this, I have begun to reconsider my life. I must now build it in such a way so as to serve Russia according to the dictates of my conscience, independent of all parties.\n\nIn 1888, Tikhomirov publicly repented of his revolutionary activities, publishing his book \"Why I am No Longer a Revolutionary\". The same year he petitioned to be allowed to return to Russia, a petition granted by Alexander III.\n\nIn commenting on his earlier life, Tikhomirov wrote in his memoirs:\n\nI do not like my youth. It is full of the passioned desires of a corrupt heart, full of impurity, full of a stupid pride, a pride of someone who, while realizing his potential, has not yet matured to analytical thinking or independence of thought. I only begin to like my life from that point (in my last years in Paris), when I matured and was liberated ... began to understand the meaning of life, began to seek God.\n\nFollowing his return from exile, Tikhomirov became one of the leading conservative thinkers of the Russian Empire. He authored several works criticizing liberal democracy, including \"Liberals and Terrorists\" (1890) and \"Liberal and Social Democracy\" (1896). He criticized democratic institutions for being controlled by party intrigue and for excessive individualism. He advocated finding a Russian alternative to the democratic idea, writing:\n\nWe must seek other ways, understanding that great truth, which is now apparent given the negative experiences of the \"new era\": that organizing a society is only possible by keeping the spiritual balance in every man. And this spiritual balance comes from a living religious ideology.\nIn 1905, Tikhomirov authored his largest work, the four-volume \"On Monarchist Statehood\", which quickly became the ideological basis for the Russian monarchist movement. In it he asserted the existence of authority as a fundamental regulatory force in society. The type of authority - democratic, aristocratic, or monarchic - is rooted to the moral and psychological state of the society. Tikhomirov wrote:\n\nIf a powerful moral ideal exists in a society, an ideal calling all to voluntary obedience to, and service of, one another, then it brings about monarchy because the existence of this ideal negates the need for physical force (democracy) or the rule of an elite (aristocracy). All that is necessary is the continual expression of this moral ideal. The most capable vehicle for this expression is one individual placed in a position of complete independence from all external political forces.\nIn 1909, Tikhomirov became the editor of the State-owned monarchist newspaper \"Moskovskie Vedomosti\". However, in 1913 the Interior Ministry suspended funding for the paper and Tikhomirov resigned as its editor. He then moved to Sergiev Posad, where he wrote his second largest work, \"On the Religious and Philosophical Fundamentals of History\".\n\nIn the Fundamentals of History, Tikhomirov argued that history is driven by two competing world views: the dualistic and the monistic. The dualistic recognizes the existence of God and the world created by God. The monistic asserts that the world has always existed of its own self. Tikhomirov then traces through all of history as the continual struggle of these two views, which will culminate at the apocalyptic end.\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, Tikhomirov worked as a school secretary in Sergiev Posad. He died on October 10, 1923.\n"}

He espoused a form of African socialism.\n\nHe was born in Bamako-Coura, a neighborhood of Bamako, which was at the time the capital of French Sudan. His family were Malian Muslims who claimed direct descent from the founders of the Mali Empire. He was educated in Bamako and at the école normale William-Ponty in Dakar, where he was top of his class. Beginning in 1936, he worked as a teacher in Bamako, Sikasso and Tombouctou.\nHis nickname after primary schooling was Modo.\n\nModibo Keïta was involved in various associations. In 1937, he was the coordinator of the art and theater group. Along with Ouezzin Coulibaly, he helped found the Union of French West African Teachers.\n\nKeïta joined the Communist Study Groups (GEC) cell in Bamako.\n\nIn 1943, he founded the \"L'oeil de Kénédougou\", a magazine critical of colonial rule. This led to his imprisonment for three weeks in 1946 at the \"Prison de la Santé\" in Paris.\n\nIn 1945 Keïta was a candidate for the Constituent Assembly of the French Fourth Republic, supported by GEC and the Sudanese Democratic Party. Later the same year, he and Mamadou Konaté founded the \"Bloc soudanais\", which developed into the Sudanese Union.\n\nIn October 1946, the African Democratic Rally (RDA) was created at a conference in Bamako of delegates from across French Africa. While the coalition was led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Keïta assumed the post of RDA Secretary-General in French Sudan, and head of the Soudanese affiliate: the US-RDA. In 1948, he was elected general councilor of French Sudan. In 1956, he was elected mayor of Bamako and became a member of the National Assembly of France. He twice served as secretary of state in the governments of Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury and Félix Gaillard. Modibo Keïta was elected constituent assembly president of the Mali Federation on July 20, 1960, which consisted of French Sudan and Senegal. Senegal would later leave the federation.\n\nAfter the collapse of the federation, the US-RDA proclaimed the Soudanese Republic's complete independence as the Republic of Mali. Keïta became its first president, and soon afterward declared the US-RDA to be the only legal party.\n\nAs a socialist, he led his country towards the progressive socialization of the economy; at first starting with agriculture and trade, then on October 1960 creating the SOMIEX (Malian Import and Export Company), which had a monopoly over the exports of the products of Mali, as well as manufactured and food imports (e.g. sugar, tea, powdered milk) and their distribution inside the country. The establishment of the Malian franc in 1962, and the difficulties of provisioning, resulted in a severe inflation and dissatisfaction of the population, particularly the peasants and the businessmen.\n\nIn June 1961, he paid a state visit to the United Kingdom, where Queen Elizabeth II invested him as an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. Although Keïta was initially viewed with some wariness by the United States because of his socialist views, he made it clear that he sought good relations with Washington. In September 1961, he travelled to America in the company of Sukarno and met with President John F. Kennedy. Keïta, afterward, felt that he had a friend in Kennedy.\n\nOn the political level, Modibo Keïta quickly imprisoned opponents like Fily Dabo Sissoko. The first post-independence elections, in 1964, saw a single list of 80 US-RDA candidates returned to the National Assembly, and Keïta was duly reelected to another term as president by the legislature. From 1967, he started the \"revolution active\" and suspended the constitution by creating the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (CNDR). The exactions of the \"milice populaire\" (the US-RDA militia) and the devaluation of the Malian franc in 1967 brought general unrest.\n\nOn November 19, 1968, General Moussa Traoré overthrew Modibo Keïta in a coup d'état, and sent him to prison in the northern Malian town of Kidal.\n\nAfter being transferred back to the capital Bamako in February 1977 in what was claimed to be an action by the government towards national reconciliation in preparation for his release, Modibo Keïta died, still a prisoner, on May 16, 1977. His reputation was rehabilitated in 1992 following the overthrow of Moussa Traoré and subsequent elections of president Alpha Oumar Konaré. A monument to Modibo Keïta was dedicated in Bamako on June 6, 1999.\n\nModibo Keïta devoted his entire life to African unity. He first played a part in the creation of the Federation of Mali with Léopold Sédar Senghor. After its collapse, he moved away from Léopold Sédar Senghor, but with Sékou Touré, the president of Guinea, and Kwame Nkrumah, the President of Ghana, he formed the Union of the States of Western Africa. In 1963, he played an important role in drafting the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\n\nIn 1963, he invited the king of Morocco and the president of Algeria to Bamako, in the hope of ending the Sand War, a frontier conflict between the two nations. Along with Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, Keïta was successful in negotiating the Bamako Accords, which brought an end to the conflict. As a result, he won the Lenin Peace Prize that year.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1966, he normalized relations with the countries of Senegal, Upper Volta and Côte d'Ivoire. An advocate of the Non-Aligned Movement, Modibo defended the nationalist movements like the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN).\n\nMalian author Massa Makan Diabaté satirizes Keïta's presidency in his novel \"The Butcher of Kouta\", which features a socialist, dictatorial president named \"Bagabaga Daba\" (literally, \"ant with a big mouth\"), who is later removed by a military coup.\n\nModibo Kéita: MALI.

{"id": "795103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=795103", "title": "Multiple drafts model", "text": "Multiple drafts model\n\nDaniel Dennett's multiple drafts model of consciousness is a physicalist theory of consciousness based upon cognitivism, which views the mind in terms of information processing. The theory is described in depth in his book, \"Consciousness Explained\", published in 1991. As the title states, the book proposes a high-level explanation of consciousness which is consistent with support for the possibility of strong AI.\n\nDennett describes the theory as \"first-person operationalism\". As he states it:\nDennett's thesis is that our modern understanding of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of René Descartes. To show why, he starts with a description of the phi illusion. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour \"before\" the second light is observed.\n\nDennett claims that conventional explanations of the colour change boil down to either \"Orwellian\" or \"Stalinesque\" hypotheses, which he says are the result of Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.\nDennett argues that there is no principled basis for picking one of these theories over the other, because they share a common error in supposing that there is a special time and place where unconscious processing becomes consciously experienced, entering into what Dennett calls the \"Cartesian theatre\". Both theories require us to cleanly divide a sequence of perceptions and reactions into before and after the instant that they reach the seat of consciousness, but he denies that there is any such moment, as it would lead to infinite regress. Instead, he asserts that there is no privileged place in the brain where consciousness happens. Dennett states that, \"[t]here does not exist ... a process such as 'recruitment of consciousness' (into what?), nor any place where the 'vehicle's arrival' is recognized (by whom?)\"\n\nWith no theatre, there is no screen, hence no reason to re-present data after it has already been analysed. Dennett says that, \"the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!\"\n\nAccording to the model, there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times, so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations, constituting the equivalent of multiple drafts of a story. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished, it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour; it does not have to wait to be presented at the theatre.\n\nLike a number of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands conscious experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness is to be found in the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.\n\nDifferent parts of the neural processing assert more or less control at different times. For something to reach consciousness is akin to becoming famous, in that it must leave behind consequences by which it is remembered. To put it another way, consciousness is the property of having enough influence to affect what the mouth will say and the hands will do. Which inputs are \"edited\" into our drafts is not an exogenous act of supervision, but part of the self-organizing functioning of the network, and at the same level as the circuitry that conveys information bottom-up.\n\nThe conscious self is taken to exist as an abstraction visible at the level of the intentional stance, akin to a body of mass having a \"centre of gravity\". Analogously, Dennett refers to the self as the \"centre of narrative gravity\", a story we tell ourselves about our experiences. Consciousness exists, but not independently of behaviour and behavioural disposition, which can be studied through heterophenomenology.\n\nThe origin of this operationalist approach can be found in Dennett's immediately preceding work. Dennett (1988) explains consciousness in terms of \"access consciousness\" alone, denying the independent existence of what Ned Block has labeled \"phenomenal consciousness\". He argues that \"Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties\". Having related all consciousness to properties, he concludes that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished from our judgements about them. He writes: \nIn other words, once we've explained a perception fully in terms of how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no such thing as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.\nThe key to the multiple drafts model is that, after removing qualia, explaining consciousness boils down to explaining the behaviour we recognise as conscious. Consciousness is as consciousness does.\n\nSome of the criticism of Dennett's theory is due to the perceived tone of his presentation. As one grudging supporter admits, \"there is much in this book that is disputable. And Dennett is at times aggravatingly smug and confident about the merits of his arguments ... All in all Dennett's book is annoying, frustrating, insightful, provocative and above all annoying\" (Korb 1993).\n\nBogen (1992) points out that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That being the case, if Cartesian materialism is true, there might be \"two\" Cartesian theatres, so arguments against only one are flawed. Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the cutaneous rabbit illusion demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.\n\nIt has also been claimed that the argument in the multiple drafts model does not support its conclusion.\n\nMuch of the criticism asserts that Dennett's theory attacks the wrong target, failing to explain what it claims to. Chalmers (1996) maintains that Dennett has produced no more than a theory of how subjects report events. Some even parody the title of the book as \"Consciousness Explained Away\", accusing him of greedy reductionism. Another line of criticism disputes the accuracy of Dennett's characterisations of existing theories:\nMultiple drafts is also attacked for making a claim to novelty. It may be the case, however, that such attacks mistake which features Dennett is claiming as novel. Korb states that, \"I believe that the central thesis will be relatively uncontentious for most cognitive scientists, but that its use as a cleaning solvent for messy puzzles will be viewed less happily in most quarters.\" (Korb 1993) In this way, Dennett uses uncontroversial ideas towards more controversial ends, leaving him open to claims of unoriginality when uncontroversial parts are focused upon.\n\nEven the notion of consciousness as drafts is not unique to Dennett. According to Hankins, Dieter Teichert suggests that Paul Ricoeur's theories agree with Dennett's on the notion that \"the self is basically a narrative entity, and that any attempt to give it a free-floating independent status is misguided.\" [Hankins] Others see Derrida's (1982) representationalism as consistent with the notion of a mind that has perceptually changing content without a definitive present instant.\n\nTo those who believe that consciousness entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate: whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.\n\nThe role of information processing in consciousness has been criticised by John Searle who, in his Chinese room argument, states that he cannot find anything that could be recognised as conscious experience in a system that relies solely on motions of things from place to place. Dennett sees this argument as misleading, arguing that consciousness is not to be found in a specific part of the system, but in the actions of the whole. In essence, he denies that consciousness requires something in addition to capacity for behaviour, saying that philosophers such as Searle, \"just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system\" (p. 439).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dissatisfied with his own progress, Huairang found Dajian Huineng in Shaozhou and became his disciple, which is recorded in various traditional biographies. Huairang is traditionally said to have given Dharma transmission to six individuals, the most prominent being Mazu Daoyi.\n\nBased on a critical reading of the textual evidence, the scholar John McRae notes that it is unlikely that Huairang actually practiced with Huineng. In the oldest version of the \"Platform Sutra\" found among the Dunhuang manuscripts, which dates to about 850 CE, Nanyue is not listed as a student of Huineng at all. Although Huairang is mentioned in 952 CE in the \"Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall\", he is not discussed in the context of Huineng. The same source records a putative coversation between him and Mazu, but there is no explicit suggestion that Mazu is his student.

{"id": "27271298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27271298", "title": "Organ gifting", "text": "Organ gifting\n\nSeveral authors have used the terms organ gifting and \"tissue gifting\" to describe processes behind organ and tissue transfers that are not captured by more traditional terms such as donation and transplantation. The concept of \"gift of life\" in the U.S. refers to the fact that \"transplantable organs must be given willingly, unselfishly, and anonymously, and any money that is exchanged is to be perceived as solely for operational costs, but never for the organs themselves\". \"Organ gifting\" is proposed to contrast with organ commodification. The maintenance of a spirit of altruism in this context has been interpreted by some as a mechanism through which the economic relations behind organ/tissue production, distribution, and consumption can be disguised. Organ/tissue gifting differs from commodification in the sense that anonymity and social trust are emphasized to reduce the offer and request of monetary compensation. It is reasoned that the implementation of the gift-giving analogy to organ transactions shows greater respect for the diseased body, honors the donor, and transforms the transaction into a morally acceptable and desirable act that is borne out of voluntarism and altruism.\n\nThe concept of gifting with regards to body parts or fluids was first analyzed by Richard Titmuss in his book titled \"The Gift Relationship: from Human Blood to Social Policy\". Here the author highlights the negative effects of compensating blood donors and the benefits of maintaining a system where the donation of body tissues and fluids is seen in the form of a gift that is voluntarily and altruistically given to society. Titmuss (1971) draws from Mauss's (1950) publication, \"The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies\", to argue that when blood is given in the form of a gift, collective social relations are formed to maintain a sense of community. Titmuss follows Mauss' (1950) ideas of gift giving as a system of total services (production, distribution, and consumption) where self-interest interacts with social and moral obligations that are collectively imposed to maintain social relationships and guarantee the reproduction of society.\n\nTitmuss' work was very influential at a policy level. It motivated the Nixon administration in the U.S. to reform its system of blood donation and led many people in the U.K. to oppose models of marketable blood donation systems. This concept has been incorporated into the phrase \"the gift of life\" which was used to refer to multiple forms of organ, blood, tissue, semen, and cell line donations. The concept of gift is widely used in policies (such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act) regarding organ transplantation and the use of cadavers for medical studies.\n\nResearchers from various disciplines have analyzed and critiqued the idea of organ gifting and this belief that gifting and organ commodification are mutually exclusive. For instance, Waldby and Mitchell, in their book \"Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism\", have indicated that \"we hope to complicate and disorganize the gift-commodity dichotomy, because we consider it an inadequate way to conceptualize the political economy of tissues in the modern world of globalized biotechnology\". Objects and their exchange serve multiple purposes and result in alternative values depending on the context.\n\nOther individuals have questioned the assumptions that link systems of organ gifting with the equitable distribution of human organs arguing that the voluntary and altruistic donation of organs does not necessarily imply the free transplantation of that organ. In other words, under current systems of healthcare in the U.S., not only are organ donations managed by private organizations such as the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), but organ transplantation is provided only to those who can afford it and in rare cases to those who desperately need it.\n\nThroughout history, human organs have acquired different characteristics, acting as both alienable and inalienable possessions depending on the temporal and spatial context. Alienable possessions are objects that can be bought and sold, while inalienable possessions are things that must be kept due to their relationships with an individual's identity and origins. During the 17th century, human organs were represented as inalienable possessions, that is, objects that could not be given away in exchange and their use by the medical profession was associated with violent actions. However, once the medical value of bodies was recognized, there was an increase in its commodification which was not legally acknowledged until the Anatomy Act, which prohibited the selling of bodies, was signed in 1832. In reality, consensus over the sale of bodies and body parts had not been reached, and as Locke as argued, \"competition over corpses and body parts existed because ideas about their value and beliefs about their alienability varied among contenders\". Currently, different representations of organs and other body parts coexist blurring the lines between alienability and inalienability.\n\nMarcel Mauss is recognized as one of the first authors interested in the study of gift economies. His main concern centered on individuals' need to provide gifts and the obligations to reciprocate them. He identified human obligation to give, receive, and reciprocate as the most important factor in the creation and maintenance of social ties. Reciprocation was mainly produced by the insertion of the giver's identity in the object that was given. The object maintained this essence (referred to as \"hau\" or \"mana\" by Mauss) of the giver which needed to return to him/her through reciprocation in the form of a counter-gift (another object, services, person, agreements, etc.).\n\nOrgan gifting entails two simultaneous gifts: the gift of the organ itself and the gift of life. The first form of gift is a transaction where the giver provides an object to the receiver. This action leads to the creation of a relationship among individuals where the receiver is compelled to provide a counter-gift. The obligation to return the gift has received various interpretations, but one common assumption is that the object that is given tends to keep a portion of the identity of the giver (hau used by Mauss). In the case of organ gifting, this personalization of the gifted object reaches extreme proportions because the gift is actually a piece of the giver's body.\n\nReciprocity tends to be discouraged in contemporary organ gifting, thus creating an irresoluble sense of debt in the receiver. This separation of the donor from the object being given was not always implemented, and in earlier cases of organ transplantation the receiver could obtain information from the donor and even meet. As Holtkamp (2002) has argued, this arrangement created a feeling of debt in the receiver (and close kin) and led to the creation of obligations. The discouragement of reciprocal relationships between giver and receiver is produced through what Sharp (2001) has labeled etiquettes of dehumanization where the identities of the donors are removed from the organs.\n\nOrgans, then, become unreciprocated gifts. According to Mauss, the unreciprocated gift makes the person who has accepted it inferior, especially when its acceptance is done without the thought of returning it. In Mauss' words, \"Charity is still wounding for him who has accepted it, and the whole tendency of our morality is to strive to do away with the unconscious and injurious patronage of the rich almsgiver\".\n\nThe prohibition, or in some cases delay, of the giver/receiver interaction creates a myriad of situations. The dehumanization of organs and the removal of all possible donor characteristics do not prevent receivers from imagining the lives of the individuals who provided the organs. Studies have shed light on cases where organ receivers feel the essence of the organ donors inside them after transplantation. The close kin of donors who have died also maintain the idea that the person in their family who has died continues to live in the body of someone else.\n\nOrgan gifting entails not only the gifting of the organ itself, but also the \"gift of life\". In this case, the organ not only represents the transference of an object from one person to the other as it was mentioned earlier, but the possession of this object in turn allows the receiver to obtain a second \"gift\", the opportunity to live. The obligation to reciprocate is still present in this form of gifting, but the possibility of providing a counter-gift of equal or greater value is practically impossible. The use of the metaphor \"gift of life\" transforms the nature of the object into a mystical one as the implication is that life emanates from a supernatural source. This is further exacerbated by the use of this same metaphor to express religious beliefs like rebirth and reincarnation.\n\nDiscussions over value are common in studies on organ gifting. As Lock has indicated, the main reason for this is that \"human body parts do not have universal value, and once, potentially available for conversion into circulating commodities, their worth, and more basically the question of whether or not they are alienable, is open to dispute\". An important factor to consider is the fact that organ gifting differs from the gifting of blood or semen in the sense that organs are scarce. It is this scarcity which creates stronger relationships between the giver and the receiver because it endows the object that is being transferred with greater value. As Appadurai (1986) has indicated, the link between exchange and value is created by politics, thus making value an issue of judgment. In the case of organ exchange, when the demand, whether real or fictitious, exceeds the supply, the object is endowed with greater value. In other words, objects can be controlled to create value. Several authors have examined the issue of organ scarcity pointing to the different ways in which it is publicly exacerbated for profit-driven interests.\n\nAnother factor that can increase the value of the object, are the characteristics of the object itself. As Sahlins (1972) has indicated, the material exchanged influences the relationship of exchange. Spielman (2002) has discussed four main qualities of social valuables that also allude to the different ways in which the object exchanged can determine the relationship maintained between the giver and receiver:\n1. Social valuables must have unique properties that distinguish their production\n2. Distance, in terms of obtaining the materials necessary for production, plays a role in the establishment of value\n3. The transformative aspects of production and the role of craftspeople need to be considered in the creation of value\n4. Value is also influenced by the modifications the good suffers as it circulates.\n\nThis last point has been examined by Appadurai through his concept of the social lives of objects where objects are seen as circulating in different regimes of value in space and time. As Appadurai has indicated, \"commodity is not one kind of thing rather than another, but one phase in the life of some things\". In the case of organ gifting, it is possible to see the biographical transformations of objects in clearer form as the object in question comes from a person and becomes part of another person. Organs can be both gifts and commodities depending on the context in question. The value of the object responds to the social relationships and contracts present in this context. This is the reason why not all organ gifting is visualized in the same form and individuals make distinctions between cadaveric donations, kin donations, and anonymous donations.\n\nFurthermore, organ gifting raises additional concerns regarding the biographies of objects because the object that is given is actually a part of another person. The interest over the life of the object includes an interest over the life of the individual who provided it as well. This has been documented by researchers examining the processes through which organ procurers select donors. As Sharp has indicated, \"through organ procurement, human bodies are commodified and codified following a relatively strict hierarchy of medical value and social worth\". Age, race and ethnicity all play a role in the identification of ideal candidates. Organ receivers are also interested in obtaining information about donors. As Lock has mentioned, \"organ recipients worry about the gender, ethnicity, skin color, personality and social status of their donors, and many believe that their mode of being-in-the-world is radically changed after a transplant, thanks to the power of diffusing form the organ they have received\".\n\nAltruism is constantly referenced by proponents of organ gifting. Authors such as Sahlins (1972), incorporated Maussian concepts of gifting and reciprocity and expanded them to describe three different types of transactions: generalized reciprocity (system of giving without taking account of how much is given), balanced reciprocity (direct exchange, expectation of equal value), and negative reciprocity (obtaining something for nothing). Individuals engage in each one of these transaction depending on the person they are exchanging with and the social distance involved. Sahlins' (1972) work has pointed to the need to examine the different types of relationships behind gift-giving and the characteristics of the transaction. In the case of generalized reciprocity, altruistic relationships are present and the expectation of reciprocity is indefinite.\n\nThe value of the object can be increased by the way in which it is given and several authors have pointed to the fact that organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth. Organs given in altruistic manner are thought to say something about the moral character of the people who give them. Furthermore, the giving of organs without any form of compensation erases the possibility that the giver will have any form of vested interest in the transaction.\n\nMunson has presented a list of the common claims made by individuals arguing against the selling of kidneys: \"a paid donor loses the psychological benefits that reward a voluntary donor; the practice reduces altruism in the society; the quality of donated kidneys will decline; the donor may suffer harm and become a burden to society; selling a kidney involves putting a price on the priceless; organ selling treats the human body as a commodity and thus reduces our respect for people\". It is believed that the commodification of organ donations could lead the organ donors to lie on issues pertaining to their health in order to obtain money in exchange for their organs, thus making the quality of the organ questionable. A direct relationship between commodification and quality is thus created where the social trust present in altruistic relationships is missing. Goodwin has argued that this distinction between commodification and altruism is based on a common assumption socially maintained regarding altruism where it is thought as \"pure and unspoiled by secondary or spurious motivations\".\n\nAnonymity is an important component of organ gifting and it is thought to foster the social well-being of donors, recipients, and close kin. Anonymity is related to the eradication of reciprocal relations between giver and receiver where the origin of the object that is exchanged is erased by eliminating the identity of the giver. According to some authors, this is currently done to promote better coping mechanisms for the recipient and close kin as well as to maintain standardized operating procedures by organ procurers. The idea is that anonymity will protect organ procurers \"from close encounters with the animistic, magic-infused thinking about transplanted organs in which the givers and receivers of cadaver organs often engage\". However, other authors have argued that the use of the gift-giving metaphor in conjunction with the enforcement of anonymous donations lead to the obscuring of the origins of body parts and the unequal power relations behind their donation and reception.\n\n\n"}

In this Yurkevich concerned himself with the philosophical clarification of what material and the observable world are. Though Yurkevich was an idealist in the sense of Platonic Realism, he was thoroughly Christian in his approach rejecting that the mind of a person as reason was the basis for the essences of things or beings and instead saying that essentialism was idealist (from conscious beings inline with Plato) but it was from the rational part of the being (their mind) and also from the emotional center and that the heart of the person was the complete expression of the person. Person or soul (hypostasis) is heart, mind and body, as the rational part of a person was but a part of the larger whole which as a heart or soul each person gave meaning to the things they experienced. Yurkevich was continuing the work that had been set out before him by his famous mentor Vladimir Soloviev.\nIdealist criticism Yurkevich work by Chernyshevsky, \"The Anthropological Principle in Philosophy\", marked the beginning of a stormy debate (statements by Chernyshevsky, M.

It is most prominently discussed in Tibetan Buddhism where Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika, are viewed to be different forms of Madhyamaka philosophy.\n\nFor Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelugpa school and the most outspoken proponent of the distinction, as well as for the Karma Kagyu school, these differences are of major importance. Tsongkhapa not only negates an inherent identity or self-characterizing essence which resides in persons, things, and abstract phenomena; but he also negates the identity of phenomena as they appear to our instinctive, everyday perception. In contrast, according to Tsongkhapa, the Svātantrika negate a \"truly existing self,\" but maintain that things exist conventionally \"according to characteristics.\"\n\nFor Tsongkhapa, the Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction centers around the role of \"prasaṅga\" (consequence) in a formal debate, and the interpretation of the meaning of both \"ultimate truth\" and \"conventional truth.\" \n\nThe Prāsaṅgika view holds reductio ad absurdum of essentialist viewpoints to be the most valid method of demonstrating emptiness of inherent existence, and that conventional things do not have a naturally occurring conventional identity. Further, the Prāsaṅgika argue that when initially attempting to find the correct object of understanding - which is a mere absence or mere negation of impossible modes of existence - one should not use positivist statements about the nature of reality. Positing an essencelessness rather than merely negating inherent identity creates a subtle linguistic and analytic barrier to finding the correct understanding. This is exemplified in the debate over the use of the terms \"devoid of nature itself\" in Gelug Mahamudra (non-affirming negation) and \"that which has voidness as its nature\" in non-Gelug Mahamudra and Dzogchen (an affirming negation).\n\nTsongkhapa argued that because the Svatantrika conventionally establish things by their own characteristics, they do not arrive at a complete understanding of emptiness. According to Tsongkhapa, not only were their methods different, but also that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach. Lama Tsongkhapa states that when he uses the term \"advocates of intrinsic existence\" he is referring to both \"essentialists and the Svatantrikas.\" Modern scholars like the 14th Dalai Lama disagree, echoing sentiments from classical authorities like Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen (4th Panchen Lama) stating that the credible teachers of the various systems of Buddhist philosophy all \"arrive at the same intended point\" of realization. However, they openly admit that this non-denominational position is very difficult to establish through reason.\n\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, if both people in a debate or discussion have a valid understanding of emptiness already, then autonomous syllogistic arguments could be quite effective. However, in a circumstance where one or both parties in a debate or discussion do not hold a valid understanding, \"the debate [should be] founded on what the parties accept as valid. Hence, it is proper to refute opponents in terms of what they accept.\" In other words, it is more appropriate to establish a position of emptiness through showing the logical consequences of the incorrect position that the opponent already accepts, than it is to establish emptiness through syllogistic reasoning using premises that the opponent (and perhaps even the proponent) do not fully or deeply understand. Tsongkhapa quoting Chandrakirti, in the \"Lamrim Chenmo, Volume Three\", on the problem of relying on autonomous syllogistic reasoning:\nTsongkhapa argues further that the Prāsaṅgika's use of reductio ad absurdum is syllogistic, because one \"refutes the opponent using a subject, a reason, and so forth that are accepted by that opponent.\" For example, if cause-effect relationships occur because the sprout itself produces the effect of being a sprout (self-arising), then this \"would mean that something that already exists is being produced, [and] production would be purposeless and endless [... if] contradictions are assembled in this way, the only result is that the opponents understand them and abandon\" wrong tenets.\n\nA prominent and important feature of the approach is their use of the \"non-affirming negation\". A non-affirming negation is a negation which does not leave something in the place of what has been negated. For instance, when one says that a Buddhist should not drink alcohol, they are not affirming that a Buddhist should, in fact, drink something else. One is merely negating the consumption of alcohol under a particular circumstance.\n\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, for the the philosophical position of emptiness is itself a non-affirming negation, since emptiness is a \"lack of inherent existence.\" One is not affirming anything in the place of that absence of inherence. It is not the presence of some other quality. If one were to describe emptiness as the presence of some quality -for example, a \"voidness\" or a \"thusness\" - it would linguistically and philosophically contradict the nature of the object which it is attempting to characterize.\n\nPabongka Rinpoche states in \"Liberation in Our Hands\" that if we cannot correctly \"recognize the nature of the false mode of existence that is being denied, we will not be able to realize the simple negation [Skr. \"prasajyapratisedhah\" or non-affirming negation] that is established through its refutation.\" For the Prāsaṅgika, when analyzing a table, the object being negated is not an abstract intellectual concept apart from the table which can be called 'inherent existing', but the conventionally appearing table itself, which appears to naive perception as being inherent. The table is not just empty of inherent existence in some abstract philosophical way; the identity of the table as it appears to normal, everyday perception - which misattributes inherence to the object - is being negated. Lama Tsongkhapa explains:We can say \"therefore, [that] what exists objectively in terms of its own essence without being posited through the power of a subjective mind is called [...] 'intrinsic nature'\" or ignorance Therefore, the object to be negated by reason is a conception that phenomena have an \"ontological status—a way of existing—in and of themselves, without being posited through the force of an awareness. Pabongka Rinpoche adds that \"while simply knowing and using verbal explanations such as these may be enough to silence an opponent in debate we have not truly recognized the object to be refuted until we have recognized it within our own experience.\" In furtherance of this:This is the meaning of both ignorance and the object to be negated by valid cognition, according to the Madhyamaka-Prāsaṅgika in the view of Lama Tsongkhapa.\n\nUnder low light, the thought might arise that a striped rope on the ground is a snake, \"but there is nothing on top of or inside this rope [...] to which we could\" validly apply the term and therefore establish a conventionally existing snake. The Dalai Lama expands: In reality, the self of persons, objects, and abstracts is like the term-concept \"snake\" being designated upon a rope, \"the snake is merely what can be designated by a mental label.\" Like this, the object of negation or ignorance is viewed to be the thought and perception which grasps the self of persons and objects to be established within their respective bases of designation. To put this in somewhat simpler terms, the thought and perception which grasps persons, things, and abstracts phenomena as existing in-and-of themselves - with characteristics or an identity of their own - is seen to be ignorance in this system.\n\nIn the Gelugpa four tenets system, the object of negation is different for the Madhyamika-Prāsaṅgika than it is for Hinayana schools of Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika. Indeed, from the Prāsaṅgika viewpoint, Buddhist and non-Buddhist essentialist schools are not negating the correct object. According to Geshe Tenzin Zopa in \"Buddhist Tenets\", the various Hinayana schools are negating a number of different objects, but none of them are inherent existence. Geshe Tenzin Zopa states: \"From Vaibhāṣika school, they [the Vasiputriyans] assert selflessness/emptiness of the person/self is that which is impermanent (can momentarily change), has parts (physical parts, moments of time, various cardinal directions) and is dependent.\" Chandrakirti explains why the Prasangika do not see this as the final correct position: Lama Tsongkhapa supports the analysis of Chandrakirti when he says: \n\nFrom the point of view of the opponents of Prasangika, it is absurd \"to conduct the extensive rational analysis required for refutations and proofs [which] is to meander among mere conventional words.\" They propose that \"all phenomena are devoid of refutation and proof, in that, if something exists, it cannot be refuted, and, if it does not exist, it need not be refuted.\" An idea which Lama Tsongkhapa refers to as \"a nonsensical collection of contradictions, showing neither general awareness of how reason establishes and negates things nor general awareness of how the path establishes and negates things.\"\n\nNagarjuna’s \"Refutation of Objections\" he deals with this idea in a similar way:\n\n<poem>What use is it to establish the negation\nOf what does not exist anyway, even without words?\nTo answer that, the words \"does not exist\"\nCause understanding; they do not eliminate.</poem>\n\nIn his \"Commentary on Refutation of Objections\" Nagarjuna expands as follows:\n\n<poem>The words, \"All things lack intrinsic nature,\" do not cause things to \nlack intrinsic nature, but, in the absence of intrinsic nature, they do make it\nunderstood that things lack intrinsic nature.\"</poem>\n\nThis can be illustrated with the following paraphrased example found in the same text. If a person named Devadatta is not in the house, but someone says, \"Devadatta is in the house.\" Then in order\nto show that Devadatta is not there, someone else will say, \"Devadatta is not there.\" Those words do not cause Devadatta not to be there but allow the first person to understand that Devadatta is not in the house. Similarly, the words, \"Things lack intrinsic nature,\" do not cause things to lack intrinsic nature, but help the those confused by ignorance to gain a valid cognition of reality.\n\nAt the time of Candrakīrti, the Prāsaṅgika discerned three levels of dependent origination:\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, Prāsaṅgika asserts that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence, because they are dependently co-arisen with mental imputation. All phenomenon in all possible worlds lack inherent existence and come into existence relative to a designating consciousness which co-arises with that phenomena.\n\nDesignation is, according to Kelsang Gyatso's translation of \"Lorig\", the application of a conceptual image or term to a selected object of mere experience. Anything which comes into existence through valid designation is part of \"conventional reality\" or \"conventional truth.\" According to Lama Tsongkhapa, something is validly designated (exists conventionally) if it meets all of the following three conditions:\n\nWhatever fails to meet those criteria does not exist. If something has a cause-effect relationship or a relationship of parts-whole, then those objects are already in existence. In order to be already existing, they must have been designated by a conceptual mind. To talk about an object that does not exist in relation to a subject is incoherent. According to Lama Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Nagarjuna, both causes and effects are merely designated by mind. Parts and wholes - being among the components that make up reality - are also merely designated by mind. Relationships between objects cannot exist without being validly designated into existence. This is the meaning of \"conventional truth\" in this system.\n\nAccording to Tsongkhapa by way of Nagarjuna, the most pervasive relationship of co-dependent arising is the third relationship, dependent designation. From the Prāsaṅgika perspective, in order for something to exist, it must be designated validly by a designating consciousness. It is mind that determines that a cause has ceased and its effect is now in existence. To exemplify this, Lama Tsongkhapa quotes Buddhapalita's response to an Abhidharmica's objection: \n\nAccording to Lama Tsongkhapa by way of Buddhapalita, this was one of the points of Nagajuna's \"Chatuṣkoṭi\". From \"Nagarjuna's Middle Way\": \"1. Not from itself, not from another, not from both, nor without cause: Never in any way is there any existing thing that has arisen.\" According to Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura, \"This is the overall conclusion for which Nāgārjuna will argue in this chapter: that existents do not come into existence as the result of causes and conditions.\" Both modern scholars like Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura, and classical commentators Lama Tsongkhapa agree on this point. The implied modifying phrase in Nagarjuna's tetralema is \"intrinsic\" or \"inherent\" according to Tsongkhapa and Chandrakirti\n\nSo, the tetralemma would read: Not from intrinsic self, not from intrinsic other, not from intrinsic both, and not from intrinsic nothingness/causelessness. Notice that each one of these statements is a non-affirming negation which merely negates the subject and does not affirm some other mode of arising in its place. These four possibilities include all possible ways that a conventional phenomenon could arise if, in fact, they arose through some type of intrinsic arising process. Each one of these modes is negated in sequence - self, other, both, no cause - to arrive at a mere absence: the absence of inherent modes of causality. These arguments are elucidated in great detail Lama Tsongkhapa's commentary on the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā \"Ocean of Reasoning\".\n\nFurther, one can look to the Seven-Point Analysis of a Chariot by Chandrakirti and find a similar treatment of parts-whole: \nIt is mind which determines that some collection of parts is now considered to be a whole. Therefore, the relationship of \"dependent designation\" is the most pervasive among the three types of dependencies, according to Prāsaṅgika. Therefore, Prāsaṅgika are not stating that nothing exists, but instead hold that phenomena \"only\" come into existence co-dependently with minds which are applying conceptual and nominal conventions to mere experiences.\n\nThings and phenomenon \"do exist\" co-dependently, based upon a relationship with a knowing and designating mind, but nothing exists in an independent, self-arising, or self-sustaining manner. The relationship between object and subject is also empty of inherent existence. From the 1st Panchen Lama's Lozang Chokyi Gyeltsen \"The Main Road of the Triumphant Ones\": To simplify the above, in the direct cognition of rigpa or clear light, there is no findable, inherent subject or object. When you arise from that meditation, things exist and function, but only as dependent designations. Thus they appear in reality - like a mirage or reflection appears in reality - but cannot be established as existing in-and-of themselves.\n\nAccording to the Prasangika, dependent-arising and emptiness are inseparable, and exist in a relationship of entity or identity. A relationship of entity or identity is one in which two objects are merely conceptually distinct, but not actually distinct. For example, the relationship between the mental categorization of a dog and that of an animal, with regards to the same being. If it is a dog, then it must also be an animal. Additionally, this relationship applies to impermanent phenomenon and products: if it's impermanent, it must be a product. Similarly, if it is a conventional arising then \"it is emptiness\", and it if is emptiness, then \"it is a conventional arising.\" These two are merely conceptually distinct, but not actually distinct. The two truths are defined only in relationship with one another. In the \"Heart Sutra\", Shariputra and Siddhārtha Gautama illucidate the idea of the emptiness-conventionality inseparability: All phenomena are of the nature of emptiness and emptiness is nowhere to be found except as the nature of all phenomena. Emptiness is established as being synonymous with dependent arising. Dependent arising, also, is established as being synonymous with emptiness. The mere appearance of phenomena due to dependent designation is inseparable from the non-obstruction to their arising, which is emptiness.\n\nAccording to both Tsongkhapa and Nagarjuna, emptiness is also empty of inherent existence: emptiness only exists nominally and conventionally. Emptiness is co-dependently arisen as a quality of conventional phenomenon and is itself a conventional phenomenon. There is no emptiness just \"floating around out there\" or a \"Great Emptiness from which everything else arises.\" For example, a table is empty of inherently being a table from its own side. This is referred to as \"the emptiness of the table.\" The emptiness of the table exists conventionally as a property of that particular table. Lama Tsongkhapa quoting Chandrakirti: \n\nFrom the Prasaṅgika point of view, it is the same with all types of emptiness. There is no \"independent emptiness\" or \"ultimate emptiness.\" Therefore, emptiness is an ultimate truth (a fact which applies to all possible phenomena, in all possible worlds), but it is not an ultimate phenomenon or ultimate reality (something which has always existed, is self-created, and is self-sustaining). It is also not a \"Tao\" or a primal substance from which all other things arise. Buddhapalita comically equates someone who thinks emptiness is inherent with someone who doesn't understand what \"nothing\" means: \n\nNagarjuna paraphrases the Buddha in the \"Mulamadhyamikakarika\", stating that \"the Conqueror said that emptiness eradicates all dogmatic views; as for those who take a dogmatic view of emptiness, he said that they are incurable. Therefore, it is clear that the Prasangika do not advocate an inherent form of emptiness.\n\nThe Prasangika refute the idea of a storehouse consciousness or mind-basis-of-all consciousness. According to Daniel Cozart's interpretation of Ngawang Belden, \"the Buddha taught the mind-basis-of-all provisionally, for the benefit of those who could be helped by believing in its existence but who would be harmed by hearing the teachings about emptiness. In his own mind, the basis of his teaching was emptiness. [...] This is because the purpose of positing a mind-basis-of-all is supposed to be to provide a basis for experience without positing external objects.\" According to the Gelugpa, the Chittamatra hold that the mind-basis-of-all consciousness is that which bears the karmic seeds and is findable upon analysis. That is, \"if one sought the basis of the designation \"of the person\" one would discover the mind-basis-of-all.\"\n\nSo, how is it that Madhyamika-Prasangika posit that beings accumulate karma and experience their effects without the mind-basis-of-all? They posit that karma is carried on the mere \"I\" which is dependently designated on the basis of the aggregates, stating that \"it is a sufficient basis with which to associate the factors of disintegratedness (karma).\" Daniel Cozant expands by saying that since phenomena are neither inherently created nor inherently destroyed according to Prasangika, that \"therefore, the possibility of a later effect is not precluded.\"\n\nAccording to Daniel Cozart's \"Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School\" (based on the work of Jamyang Shayba and Ngawang Belden) there are eight unique tenets within the Madhyamika-Prasangika viewpoint:\n\n\nHe also cites thirteen distinguishing features of the Prasangika view:\n\n\nAccording to the Padmakara Translation Group: \n\nAccording to the Nyingma lineage, Ju Mipham was one of the critics who argued that Je Tsongkhapa was also a Svatantrika, because of the way he refutes true establishment instead of objects themselves. According to Ju Mipham, Je Tsongkhapa's approach is an excellent Svatantrika approach, that leads students in the right direction but will not lead to the true ultimate until they go further.\n\nAs a result of Je Tsongkhapa's view, the Gelugpa lineage establishes a sort of ladder of progressively refined worldviews and identify the Svatantrika view as inferior to the Prasangika. Sakya and Kagyu scholars argued against the claim that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach; According to those critics, there is no difference in the realization of those using the Svatantrika and Prasangika approaches. They also argue that the Svatantrika approach is better for students who are not able to understand the more direct approach of Prasangika, but it nonetheless results in the same ultimate realization.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1640527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1640527", "title": "Process and Reality", "text": "Process and Reality\n\nProcess and Reality is a book by Alfred North Whitehead, in which Whitehead propounds a philosophy of organism, also called process philosophy. The book, published in 1929, is a revision of the Gifford Lectures he gave in 1927–28.\n\nWhitehead's background was an unusual one for a speculative philosopher. Educated as a mathematician, he became, through his coauthorship and 1913 publication of \"Principia Mathematica\" with Bertrand Russell, a major logician. Later he wrote extensively on physics and its philosophy, proposing a theory of gravity in Minkowski space as a logically possible alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Whitehead's \"Process and Reality\" is perhaps his philosophical master work.\n\nThe following is an attempt to provide an accessible outline of some of the main ideas in Whitehead's \"Process and Reality\", based on the book itself, but guided by a general reading of secondary sources, especially I. Leclerc's \"Whitehead's Metaphysics. An Introductory Exposition\". Whitehead often speaks of the metaphysics of \"Process and Reality\" as 'the philosophy of organism'.\n\nThe cosmology elaborated in \"Process and Reality\" posits an ontology based on the two kinds of existence of entity, that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or abstraction.\n\nThe ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is creativity. Actual existence is a process of becoming, and \"... 'becoming' is a creative advance into novelty.\" It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognises singular causality as efficient causality. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.\n\nAn actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of changeable entities considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and profound and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, \"qua\" actual entities, with a single exception, God.\n\nFor example, for Aristotle, the actual entities were the substances, such as Socrates (a particular citizen of Athens) and Bucephalus (a particular horse belonging to Alexander the Great). Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in Leibniz' monads, said to be 'windowless'.\n\nFor Whitehead, the actual entities exist as the only foundational elements of reality, the ultimately existing facts of the world. Nothing \"either in fact or in efficacy\" underlies or lies beyond the actual entities; rather they underlie all reality.\n\nThe actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.\n\nWith one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are temporal and are occasions of experience (which are not to be confused with consciousness, or with mere subjectivity). This 'actual entity' idea is most distinctly characteristic of the metaphysics of \"Process and Reality\", and requires of the newly approaching reader a philosophically unprejudiced approach. An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete object, or that Aristotle would think of as a substance – a human being included – is in this ontology considered to be a composite of indefinitely many occasions of experience.\n\nThe one exceptional actual entity is at once temporal and atemporal: God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object. Whitehead uses the term 'actual occasion' to refer only to purely temporal actual entities, those other than God.\n\nThe occasions of experience are of four grades. The first comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the qualia of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions in the grades one, two, and three lack that aspect. The highest grade of experience \"is to be identified with the canalized importance of free conceptual functionings\".\n\nThere is no mind-matter duality in this ontology, because \"mind\" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental and the material aspects are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as \"persistent physical objects\", neither being actual entities. Though not recognised by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by Galen, that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.\n\nInherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them.\n\nThe causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be spatially separated. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of special relativity and with the Minkowski geometry of spacetime. It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book \"An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge\" as well as in \"Process and Reality\". Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.\n\nThe actual entity, the occasion of experience, is logically atomic in the sense that it cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatiotemporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain indefinitely many other actual entities.\n\nWhitehead's theory of extension concerns the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in \"Process and Reality\". Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can overlap in Minkowski space.\n\nAn example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an enduring physical object, which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object temporally has an earliest and a last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.\n\nAnother aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but is itself unchangeable.\n\nWhitehead's abstractions are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities, but are the only entities that can be real.\n\nAn abstraction is a conceptual entity that involves more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a nexus emphasises some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasised or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasised.\n\nWhitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an eternal object is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.\n\nFor Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract ingredient eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.\n\nWhitehead's ontological principle is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.\n\nThe several originally published editions of \"Process and Reality\" were from New York and from Cambridge UK. There were many textual errors, partly due to Whitehead's imperfect handwriting and lack of interest in proof-reading. A largely corrected scholarly redaction was eventually prepared and published as \"Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology\" (1929). 1979 corrected edition, edited by David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne, Free Press, .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24209", "title": "Profanity", "text": "Profanity\n\nProfanity is socially offensive language, which may also be called curse words, cuss words, swear words, crude language, coarse language, oaths, blasphemous language, vulgar language, lewd language, choice words, or expletives. \n\nUsed in this sense, profanity is language that is generally considered to be strongly impolite, rude or offensive. It can show a debasement of someone or something, or show intense emotion.\n\nIn its older, more literal sense, \"profanity\" refers to a lack of respect for things that are held to be sacred, which implies anything inspiring deserving of reverence, as well as behaviour showing similar disrespect or causing religious offense.\n\nThe term \"profane\" originates from classical Latin \"profanus\", literally \"before (outside) the temple\". It carried the meaning of either \"desecrating what is holy\" or \"with a secular purpose\" as early as the 1450s. Profanity represented secular indifference to religion or religious figures, while blasphemy was a more offensive attack on religion and religious figures, considered sinful, and a direct violation of The Ten Commandments. Moreover, many Bible verses speak against swearing.\n\nProfanities, in the original meaning of \"blasphemous profanity\", are part of the ancient tradition of the comic cults which laughed and scoffed at the deity or deities. An example from \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" is \"Christ, look ye, its \"Mere de\" ... \"merde\" ... shit, Mother of God.\"\n\nIn English, swear words and curse words tend to have Germanic, rather than Latin etymology \"Shit\" has a Germanic root, as, likely, does \"fuck\". The more technical alternatives are often Latin in origin, such as \"defecate\" or \"excrete\" and \"fornicate\" or \"copulate\" respectively. Because of this, profanity is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"Anglo-Saxon\". This is not always the case. For example, the word wanker is considered profane in Britain but its origin dates only to the middle of the 20th Century.\n\nAnalyses of recorded conversations reveal that an average of roughly 80–90 words that a person speaks each day 0.5% to 0.7% of all words are swear words, with usage varying from 0% to 3.4%. In comparison, first-person plural pronouns (\"we\", \"us\", \"our\") make up 1% of spoken words.\n\nA three-country poll conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion in July 2010 found that Canadians swear more often than Americans and British when talking to friends, while Britons are more likely than Canadians and Americans to hear strangers swear during a conversation.\n\nSwearing performs certain psychological functions, and uses particular linguistic and neurological mechanisms; all these are avenues of research. Functionally similar behavior can be observed in chimpanzees, and may contribute to our understanding, notes \"New York Times\" author Natalie Angier. Angier also notes that swearing is a widespread but perhaps underappreciated anger management technique; that \"Men generally curse more than women, unless said women are in a sorority, and that university provosts swear more than librarians or the staff members of the university day care center\".\n\nKeele University researchers Stephens, Atkins, and Kingston found that swearing relieves the effects of physical pain. Stephens said \"I would advise people, if they hurt themselves, to swear\".\nHowever, the overuse of swear words tends to diminish this effect. The Keele team won the Ig Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for their research.\n\nA team of neurologists and psychologists at the UCLA Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research suggested that swearing may help differentiate Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal dementia.\n\nNeurologist Antonio Damasio noted that despite loss of language due to damage to the language areas of the brain, patients were still often able to swear.\n\nA group of researchers from Wright State University studied why people swear in the online world by collecting tweets posted on Twitter. They found that cursing is associated with negative emotions such as sadness (21.83%) and anger (16.79%) thus showing people in the online world mainly use curse words to express their sadness and anger towards others.\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of researchers from the University of Warsaw investigated bilingual swearing: why is it easier to swear in a foreign language? Their finding that bilinguals strengthen the offensiveness of profanities when they switch into their second language, but soften it when they switch into their first tongue, but do both statistically significantly only in the case of ethnophaulisms (ethnic slurs) led the scientist to the conclusion that switching into the second language exempts bilinguals from the social norms and constraints (whether own or socially imposed) such as political correctness, and makes them more prone to swearing and offending others.\n\nAccording to Steven Pinker, there are five possible functions of swearing—although others (e.g., Salmani Nodoushan) have reduced it to three major functions:\n\nThree Australian states (New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria) have laws against using \"offensive language\" in public. These offences are classed as a summary offence. However, if the court is satisfied that the individual concerned had \"a reasonable excuse to behave in such a manner\", no offence is committed. In Australia's remaining states and territories, swearing is not illegal \"per se\", but depending on circumstances may constitute disorderly conduct or a breach of the peace.\n\nIn Brazil, the Penal Code does not contain any penalties for profanity in public in a direct manner. However, direct offenses against one can be considered a crime against honor, with penalty of imprisonment of one to three months or a fine. The analysis of the offense is considered \"subjective\", depending on the context of the discussion and the relationship between the parts. \n\nSection 175 of Canada's Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence to \"cause a disturbance in or near a public place\" by \"swearing […] or using insulting or obscene language\". Provinces and municipalities may also have their own laws against swearing in public. For instance, the Municipal Code of Toronto bars \"profane or abusive language\" in public parks. In June 2016, a man in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was arrested for using profane language at a protest against Bill C-51.\n\nIn New Zealand, the \"Summary Offences Act 1981\" makes it illegal to use \"indecent or obscene words in or within hearing of any public place\". However, if the defendant has \"reasonable grounds for believing that his words would not be overheard\" then no offence is committed. Also, \"the court shall have regard to all the circumstances pertaining at the material time, including whether the defendant had reasonable grounds for believing that the person to whom the words were addressed, or any person by whom they might be overheard, would not be offended\".\n\nSwearing, in and of itself, is not usually a criminal offence in the United Kingdom although in context may constitute a component of a crime. However, it may be a criminal offence in Salford Quays under a public space protection order which outlaws the use of \"foul and abusive language\" without specifying any further component to the offence, although it appears to be unclear as to whether all and every instance of swearing is covered. Salford City Council claims that the defence of \"reasonable excuse\" allows all the circumstances to be taken into account. In England and Wales, swearing in public where it is seen to cause harassment, alarm or distress may constitute an offence under section 5(1) and (6) of the Public Order Act 1986. In Scotland, a similar common law offence of breach of the peace covers issues causing public alarm and distress.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, swearing in the workplace can be an act of gross misconduct under certain circumstances. In particular, this is the case when swearing accompanies insubordination against a superior or humiliation of a subordinate employee. However, in other cases it may not be grounds for instant dismissal. According to a UK site on work etiquette, the \"fact that swearing is a part of everyday life means that we need to navigate a way through a day in the office without offending anyone, while still appreciating that people do swear. Of course, there are different types of swearing and, without spelling it out, you really ought to avoid the 'worst words' regardless of who you’re talking to\". With respect to swearing between colleagues, the site explains that \"although it may sound strange, the appropriateness [of] swearing [...] is influenced largely by the industry you are in and the individuals you work with\". The site continues to explain that, even in a workplace in which swearing is the norm, there is no need to participate in it. The site stresses that swearing is, in general, more problematic in asymmetric situations, such as in the presence of senior management or clients, but it also mentions that a \"holier than thou\" attitude towards clients may be problematic.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported that \"36% of the 308 UK senior managers and directors having responded to a survey accepted swearing as part of workplace culture\", but warned about specific inappropriate uses of swearing such as when it is discriminatory or part of bullying behaviour. The article ends with a quotation from Ben Wilmott (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development): \"Employers can ensure professional language in the workplace by having a well drafted policy on bullying and harassment that emphasises how bad language has potential to amount to harassment or bullying.\"\n\nIn the United States, courts have generally ruled that the government does not have the right to prosecute someone solely for the use of an expletive, which would be a violation of their right to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment. On the other hand, they have upheld convictions of people who used profanity to incite riots, harass people, or disturb the peace. In 2011, a North Carolina statute that made it illegal to use \"indecent or profane language\" in a \"loud and boisterous manner\" within earshot of two or more people on any public road or highway was struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nMinced oaths are euphemistic expressions made by altering or clipping profane words and expressions to make them less objectionable. Although minced oaths are often acceptable in situations where profanity is not (including the radio), some people still consider them profanity. In 1941, a judge threatened a lawyer with contempt of court for using the word \"darn\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5335451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5335451", "title": "Shalom bayit", "text": "Shalom bayit\n\nShalom bayit () (also shelom bayit, shlom bayit, or (Yiddish) sholom bayis) is the Jewish religious concept of domestic harmony and good relations between husband and wife. In a Jewish court of law, \"shalom bayit\" is the Hebrew term for marital reconciliation.\n\nThe term \"sh'lom beto\" () is found in the Talmud regarding domestic peace in general. Nowadays, it is mostly used regarding matrimonial peace.\n\nThroughout the history of the Jewish people, Jews have held an ideal standard for Jewish family life that is manifested in the term \"shalom bayit\". \"Shalom bayit\" signifies completeness, wholeness, and fulfillment. Hence, the traditional Jewish marriage is characterized by peace, nurturing, respect, and \"chesed\" (roughly meaning \"kindness\", more accurately \"loving-kindness\"), through which a married couple becomes complete. It is believed that God's presence dwells in a pure and loving home\n\nIn Jewish culture, a marriage is described as a \"match made in heaven,\" and is treated as a holy enterprise. For example, the Jewish betrothal ceremony is referred to in classical rabbinic literature as \"Kiddushin\" (meaning \"hallowing\" / \"sanctification\" / \"consecration\"). By declaring the marriage union sacred, a couple stands sanctified before God. It is in a relationship where both husband and wife recognize each other as creations in God's image and treat each other accordingly that true sanctity emanates forth. Moreover, this sanctity of the marital union reminds the Jewish husband and wife to express their holiness through marriage and to build a home based on mutual love, respect, and chesed.\n\nThe greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife that fulfils the wishes of her husband. The husband too was expected to love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her \"more\" than he honours himself; indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth. Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life.\n\nTough love was frowned upon; the Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household, and domestic abuse by him was also condemned. It was said of a wife that \"God counts her tears\".\n\nIn Jewish thought and law, domestic harmony is an important goal; to this end, an early midrash argues that a wife should not leave the home \"too frequently\". \n\nThe goal may even warrant engaging in a \"white lie\". According to the Talmud, when God tells Sarah she will give birth to a son, she expresses disbelief, saying: \"After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my husband being old also?\" But when God speaks to Abraham, he says: \"Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?\" (Genesis: 18:12-13). The rabbis comment that God omitted Sarah's mention of Abraham's age out of concern for their \"shalom bayit\".\n\n"}

V. Iyer and produced by T. Subbarami Reddy. It took Iyer 11 years to finish the research work required for the film and to write the screenplay.\n\nThe film starred Sarvadaman D. Banerjee as Swami Vivekananda, the 19th-century Hindu monk, and Mithun Chakraborty as Ramakrishna, his guru. Even though the film was completed and was considered for 1995 national awards, the film got released on 12 June 1998. The film was premiered on India's public service broadcaster \"Doordarshan\" on 15 August 1998, the country's Independence Day.\n\nThe film received mixed, mainly negative, reviews from critics. Mithun Chakraborty's acting in this film was widely appreciated and he won his third National Film Award.\n\nThe film mainly captures the events of Vivekananda's life from his birth to 1897, when he returned to India from the West. The film begins with the birth of Narendranath Datta (pre-monastic name of Swami Vivekananda) and shows the neighbors and relatives of Datta family celebrating the event. It immediately moves to the scene where Narendranath sees his father Vishwanath Datta is donating money, clothes, food to poor and distressed people. Seeing this, young Narendranath asks his father to give him something too, and his father tells him to go and look at mirror and find what he had already given him. Following his father's suggestion, Narendranath goes to the room, sees his image in the mirror.\n\nDifferent events of child Narendranath are shown one by one, such as his mother is melodiously reciting religious scriptures which leaves an impression on his young mind, Narendranath practicing meditation, his mother is teaching him that experience is true knowledge, and his interest in studying a wide range of subjects.\n\nYoung Narendranath attends college where he gets acquainted with European literature and contemporary social and religious movements. He also joins \"Brahmo Samaj\". But there he finds that the leader who is suggesting others to resist child marriage, is himself organizing his minor daughter's marriage with a wealthy person. Narendranath goes to Debendranath Tagore and asks him if he has seen God. Tagore confesses that he did not have that experience and also tells Narendranath that he had \"Yogi\"'s eyes.\n\nNarendranath meets Ramakrishna in a friend's house where Narendranath sings a devotional song \"Bina Prem Dhiraj Nahi\". Narendranath's song impresses Ramakrishna who asks him to visit Dakshineswar Kali Temple, where Ramakrishna was based. Following Ramakrishna's invitation, Narendranath visits Dakshinewsar. The relation between Ramakrishna and Narendranath have been shown with great details. Narendranath initially rejects Ramakrishna but gradually accepts him as his master. Ramakrishna teaches him the true meaning of religion and how one can find God.\n\nAfter the death of Ramakrishna, Narendranath takes formal monastic vow, becomes a \"Sannyasi\" and a wandering monk. In Alwar, he meets Raja Mangal Singh whom he tells Hindu's idol-worship is actually a symbolic form of worship.\n\nIn 1893, Vivekananda goes to Chicago to attend the Parliament of the World's Religions. There he gets tremendous success. The story of the film quickly moves to 1897, when Vivekananda returns to India. The film ends with a long English speech of Vivekananda in which he describes his ideals, objectives of Hinduism and prays for world-peace and fraternity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 1969 G. V. Iyer made several films on Hinduism and Hindu religious figures such as \"Adi Shankaracharya\" (1983), \"Madhavacharya\" (1986), \"Ramanujacharya\" (1989), and \"Bhagavad Gita\" (1993). The biopic on Swami Vivekananda was a film in this series which Iyer and Subbarami Reddy (producer of the film) called their \"celluloid tribute to the soul of India\". This punch line was enough to elicit the attention of the public to watch the movie.\n\nUnlike Iyer's previous films, \"Swami Vivekananda\" was a big-budget and big-banner film. Iyer started his studies and research work in 1986 and it took him 11 years to finish his research work and write the screenplay of the film. He commented— \"The study of philosophy is the work of a lifetime and I would never want my films to be lacking.\"\n\nSarvadaman D. Banerjee played the role of Vivekananda in this film. Banerjee was a regular actor in Iyer's films and portrayed the role of Adi Shankara in his film \"Adi Shankaracharya\" (1983) too. Bengali film actor Mithun Chakraborty portrayed Ramakrishna's character. This was his first film with Iyer. After receiving \"Lifetime achievement award\" in 2012 Chakraborty told, he tried to follow the teachings of Swami Vivekananda throughout his acting career. Chakraborty cast in the role of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, lends credence to the film by his sterling acting histrionics which earned him the accolade as an \"intuitive and mysticalin a tour de force rendering\". Debashree Roy was choiced to play Sarada Devi, the consort of Ramakrishna. Roy told in an interview that the acting in the film as Sarada Devi was a special blessing for her and she felt \"strange emotions\" during the shooting. Apart from the lead roles the film has a galaxy of famous stars in different small roles resulting in its production budget touching Rs 30 million. Hema Malini has acted in the role of overdressed Bhavatarini, Rakhee is cast as Rajasthani tribal woman, Jaya Prada is in a dancing girl role. Many famous male actors like Mammooty, Shammi Kapoor, Shashi Kapoor and Anupam Kher also have small roles.\n\nThe soundtracks of the film were composed by Salil Chowdhury, who died soon after the composing was completed. Most of the songs in the film were written by Gulzar. Songs written by Surdas, Kabir, Jayadeva were also used in this film. There was one Bengali song in the film— \"Nahi Surjo Nahi Jyoti\"— the song was written by Swami Vivekananda himself in 1897 when he was staying in Chennai (then known as Madras).\nThe film's theme with complex overtones of religious and political implications generated controversy, even before the film was launched. T. Subbarami Reddy, the producer of the film, wanted to sign Naseeruddin Shah for the role of Ramakrishna, but they had to drop the idea when few zealots of Hindu nationalists of Maharashtra threatened them and warned that they would not allow the film if a Muslim actor portrays a Hindu Brahmin in the film. Then the film-makers approached Mithun Chakraborty, a Hindu Brahmin, who agreed to play the character.\n\nBefore the release of the film in 1998, Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission monks alleged that Iyer had distorted Vivekananda and his master Ramakrishna in this film and suggested Iyer to make a number of changes in the film. They alleged that the scenes were not authentic and has little or no similarity with actual events of the Swami's life. In addition, Swami Harshananda, the then President of Ramakrihsna Math, Bangalore, asked the production house to delete their name from the title card since they were not associated with the film. Iyer accepted the suggestions of Ramakrishna Math and Mission authorities and made the requested changes in the film before the release. The Ramakrishna Mission's monks also objected one song sequence as not appropriate as it \"showed Swamiji in poor light\". As result, the objectionable song sequence was deleted from the film.\n\nAccording to a news report published in the \"Indian Express\" on 15 August 1998, Iyer made more or less 20 changes in the film. Later Iyer told, he \"surrendered\" to the suggestions of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission authority. Subsequently, later in the month, it was cleared for public screening by the Delhi High Court.\n\nHowever, the character of Sister Nivedita, who played a crucial role in Vivekananda's life, was omitted in this film.\n\nThe film was released on 12 June 1998. The film was premiered on India's public service broadcaster Doordarshan on 15 August 1998 as a part of Doordarshan's celebration of 50th year of India's Independence.\n\nThough not in the same genre of films as produced by Satyajit Ray or Shyam Benegal, the film is a typical Indian mythological, it has been appreciated for blending the role of \"eccentric middle-aged mystic, nominally a Brahmin priest, claiming nothing short of godhood role “ of Paramahmsa very well with that of the “ young non-Brahmin agnostic modernist role\" of Vivekananda.\n\nThe film received mixed and mainly negative reviews. S. Kalidas of \"India Today\" felt that the film had many \"warts and weaknesses\". He gave positive remarks for Mithun Chakraborty's acting of and wrote— \"(the film) is well worth watching for the sheer power of Mithun Chakraborty's performance as Vivekananda's mentor, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, if not for the moving message of its narrative.\" The reviewer said that Sarvadaman D. Banerjee played the role of Vivekananda with \"quite competence.\"\n\nChoodie Shivaram of \"Hinduism Today\" wrote in his review— \"the film runs though like a school textbook without the trademark insightful Iyer interpretations.\" He found none of the actors' and actresses' acting impressive other than Mithun Chakraborty's. He widely appreciated Mithun Chakraborty's portrayal of Ramakrishna and commented— \"The first half of the four-hour film was gripping, especially with Mithun's superlative portrayal of Ramakrisha. The one-time heart throb, disco dancer and martial arts fighter in the role of Ramakrishna held the audience spell bound.\"\n\nThe film won Mithun Chakraborty his third National Film Award, this time for Best Supporting Actor category.\n\n"}

The book is also noteworthy as a demarcation of Marcuse's split with Marxism via his rejection of Marxist aesthetics.\n\n\"The Aesthetic Dimension\" (not to be confused with a chapter from Marcuse's \"Eros and Civilization\" of the same name) is a response to previous writings within critical theory on the subject of art, notably those of Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno. Marcuse rejected Benjamin's call in \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" for the politicization (i.e., a literal reflection of perceived political realities) of modern, reproducible art both to reflect the state of a society and to incite change. Like both Benjamin and Adorno, Marcuse believed that art promises resistance to societal repression, and that a cultural revolution is necessarily connected to a political or social revolution. Adorno (as represented mainly by his posthumous \"Aesthetic Theory\") and Marcuse agreed that this possibility must be realized through artistic detachment and symbolism. Marcuse however offered a more inclusive and less radical suggestion for modern art's source of power than did Adorno, who believed that the works of high culture were the sole artistic source of potential emancipation.\n\nMarcuse instead pointed to what he perceived to be the successes of high culture and translated these to all areas of art. For Marcuse, art's promise of transcendence could only be fulfilled via a conceptual independence from society, but this independence is accessible through a host of media. The successful artist will attain \"truth\" in his work through \"detachment\" that results in \"symbolic representation.\" This successful art must necessarily invoke a longing for something utopian and the promise of ultimate happiness represented by beauty. This symbolic longing for fulfillment will awaken us from complacency.\n\nMarcuse stated in the book's introduction that he considered literature the primary source of his influence for this system, but feels that the ideas would apply to music and plastic arts as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "202777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202777", "title": "The Birth of Tragedy", "text": "The Birth of Tragedy\n\nThe Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music () is an 1872 work of dramatic theory by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It was reissued in 1886 as \"The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism\" (). The later edition contained a prefatory essay, \"\", wherein Nietzsche commented on this earliest book.\n\nNietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that transcended the pessimism and nihilism of a fundamentally meaningless world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.\n\nOriginally educated as a philologist, Nietzsche discusses the history of the tragic form and introduces an intellectual dichotomy between the Dionysian and the Apollonian (very loosely: reality as disordered and undifferentiated by forms versus reality as ordered and differentiated by forms). Nietzsche claims life always involves a struggle between these two elements, each battling for control over the existence of humanity. In Nietzsche's words, \"Wherever the Dionysian prevailed, the Apollonian was checked and destroyed... wherever the first Dionysian onslaught was successfully withstood, the authority and majesty of the Delphic god Apollo exhibited itself as more rigid and menacing than ever.\" Yet neither side ever prevails due to each containing the other in an eternal, natural check or balance.\n\nNietzsche argues that the tragedy of Ancient Greece was the highest form of art due to its mixture of both Apollonian and Dionysian elements into one seamless whole, allowing the spectator to experience the full spectrum of the human condition. The Dionysian element was to be found in the music of the chorus, while the Apollonian element was found in the dialogue which gave a concrete symbolism that balanced the Dionysian revelry. Basically, the Apollonian spirit was able to give form to the abstract Dionysian.\n\nBefore the tragedy, there was an era of static, idealized plastic art in the form of sculpture that represented the Apollonian view of the world. The Dionysian element was to be found in the wild revelry of festivals and drunkenness, but, most importantly, in music. The combination of these elements in one art form gave birth to tragedy. He theorizes that the chorus was originally always satyrs, goat-men. (This is speculative, although the word “tragedy” τραγωδία is contracted from trag(o)-aoidiā = \"goat song\" from \"tragos\" = \"goat\" and \"aeidein\" = \"to sing\".) Thus, he argues, “the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man” for the audience; they participated with and as the chorus empathetically, “so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses, as satyrs.” But in this state, they have an Apollonian dream vision of themselves, of the energy they're embodying. It's a vision of the god, of Dionysus, who appears before the chorus on the stage. And the actors and the plot are the development of that dream vision, the essence of which is the ecstatic dismembering of the god and of the Bacchantes' rituals, of the inseparable ecstasy and suffering of human existence.\n\nAfter the time of Aeschylus and Sophocles, there was an age where tragedy died. Nietzsche ties this to the influence of writers like Euripides and the coming of rationality, represented by Socrates. Euripides reduced the use of the chorus and was more naturalistic in his representation of human drama, making it more reflective of the realities of daily life. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. For Nietzsche, these two intellectuals helped drain the ability of the individual to participate in forms of art, because they saw things too soberly and rationally. The \"participation mystique\" aspect of art and myth was lost, and along with it, much of man's ability to live creatively in optimistic harmony with the sufferings of life. Nietzsche concludes that it may be possible to reattain the balance of Dionysian and Apollonian in modern art through the operas of Richard Wagner, in a \"rebirth\" of tragedy.\n\nIn contrast to the typical Enlightenment view of ancient Greek culture as noble, simple, elegant and grandiose, Nietzsche believed the Greeks were grappling with pessimism. The universe in which we live is the product of great interacting forces; but we neither observe nor know these as such. What we put together as our conceptions of the world, Nietzsche thought, never actually addresses the underlying realities. It is human destiny to be controlled by the darkest universal realities and, at the same time, to live life in a human-dreamt world of illusions.\n\nThe issue, then, or so Nietzsche thought, is how to experience and understand the Dionysian side of life without destroying the obvious values of the Apollonian side. It is not healthy for an individual, or for a whole society, to become entirely absorbed in the rule of one or the other. The soundest (healthiest) foothold is in both. Nietzsche's theory of Athenian tragic drama suggests exactly how, before Euripides and Socrates, the Dionysian and Apollonian elements of life were artistically woven together. The Greek spectator became healthy through direct experience of the Dionysian within the protective spirit-of-tragedy on the Apollonian stage.\n\nIn January and February 1870, Nietzsche delivered two lectures about ancient Greek drama. After receiving copies of the lectures, his friends Richard and Cosima Wagner suggested that he write a book about the subject. In April 1871, he submitted a manuscript to publisher Wilhelm Engelmann. When Englemann was unresponsive, Nietzsche asked for the return of the manuscript in June. He had a portion of the book privately printed under the title \"Socrates and Greek Tragedy\" () and sent to friends. Richard Wagner received the first copy on 18 June.\n\nIn October 1871, Nietzsche submitted a revised manuscript to E. W. Fritzsch, who had published works by Wagner. Fritzsch accepted the book in November. Printing was completed at the end of December, and the book, now titled \"The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music\" (), reached bookstores on 2 January 1872. A second edition was printed by Fritzsch in 1874, but due to the publisher's financial problems, it was not bound until 1875 and had little circulation. In 1878, the remaining copies and publication rights for the first two editions were acquired by Nietzsche's new publisher, Ernst Schmeitzner.\n\nBy 1886, Nietzsche had fallen out with Schmeitzner, and Fritzsch had recovered from his financial difficulties. Fritzsch published a new edition in October 1886, retitled \"The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism\" (), with an added prefatory essay by Nietzsche called \"An Attempt at Self-Criticism\", commenting on the earlier editions.\n\n\"The Birth of Tragedy\" is a young man's work, and shows the influence of many of the philosophers Nietzsche had been studying. His interest in classical Greece as in some respects a rational society can be attributed in some measure to the influence of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, although Nietzsche departed from Winckelmann in many ways. In addition, Nietzsche uses the term \"naïve\" in exactly the sense used by Friedrich Schiller. Of great importance are the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, especially \"The World as Will and Representation\". The Apollonian experience bears great similarity to the experience of the world as \"representation\" in Schopenhauer's sense, and the experience of the Dionysian bears similarities to the identification with the world as \"will.\" Nietzsche opposed Schopenhauer's Buddhistic negation of the will. He argued that life is worth living despite the enormous amount of cruelty and suffering that exists.\n\nOne year before the publication of ‘’The Birth of Tragedy’’, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled On Music and Words. In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.\n\n\"The Birth of Tragedy\" was angrily criticized by many respected professional scholars of Greek literature. Particularly vehement was philologist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who denounced Nietzsche's work as slipshod and misleading. Prompted by Nietzsche, Erwin Rohde—a friend who had written a favorable review that sparked the first derogatory debate over the book—responded by exposing Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's inaccurate citations of Nietzsche's work. Richard Wagner also issued a response to Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's critique, but his action only served to characterize Nietzsche as the composer's lackey.\n\nIn his denunciation of \"The Birth of Tragedy\", Wilamowitz says:\n\nIn suggesting the Greeks might have had problems, Nietzsche was departing from the scholarly traditions of his age, which viewed the Greeks as a happy, perhaps even naive, and simple people. The work is a web of professional philology, philosophical insight, and admiration of musical art. As a work in philology, it was almost immediately rejected, virtually destroying Nietzsche's academic aspirations. The music theme was so closely associated with Richard Wagner that it became an embarrassment to Nietzsche once he himself had achieved some distance and independence from Wagner. It stands, then, as Nietzsche's first complete, published philosophical work, one in which a battery of questions are asked, sketchily identified, and questionably answered.\n\nMarianne Cowan, in her introduction to Nietzsche's \"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\", describes the situation in these words:\n\nBy 1886, Nietzsche himself had reservations about the work, and he published a preface in the 1886 edition where he re-evaluated some of his main concerns and ideas in the text. In this post-script, Nietzsche referred to \"The Birth of Tragedy\" as \"an impossible book... badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo, [and] without the will to logical cleanliness.\" Still, he defended the \"arrogant and rhapsodic book\" for inspiring \"fellow-rhapsodizers\" and for luring them on to \"new secret paths and dancing places.\"\n\nIn 1888, in \"Ecce Homo\", Nietzsche was back on the attack. He defends \"The Birth of Tragedy\" by stating: \"...It is indifferent toward politics,—'un-German,' to use the language of the present time—it smells offensively Hegelian, and the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer sticks only to a few formulas. An 'idea'—the antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian—translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the development of this 'idea'; in tragedy this antithesis is sublimated into a unity; under this perspective things that had never before faced each other are suddenly juxtaposed, used to illuminate each other, and comprehended... Opera, for example, and the revolution.— The two decisive innovations of the book are, first, its understanding of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks: for the first time, a psychological analysis of this phenomenon is offered, and it is considered as one root of the whole of Greek art. The other is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates is recognized for the first time as an instrument of Greek disintegration, as a typical décadent. 'Rationality' against instinct. 'Rationality' at any price as a dangerous force that undermines life!— Profound, hostile silence about Christianity throughout the book. That is neither Apollinian nor Dionysian; it negates all aesthetic values—the only values that the 'Birth of Tragedy' recognizes: it is nihilistic in the most profound sense, while in the Dionysian symbol the ultimate limit of affirmation is attained. There is one allusion [The Birth of Tragedy, 24] to Christian priests as a 'vicious kind of dwarfs' who are 'subterranean' ...\"\n\nIn the title of his novel \"The Magic Mountain\", Thomas Mann alludes to a passage from \"The Birth of Tragedy\", and the influence of Nietzsche's work can be seen in the novel's character Mynheer Peepercorn, who embodies the \"Dionysian principle.\"\n\nWithin the context of a critical study of Nietzsche's \"atheist humanism\", the influential Catholic theologian Henri de Lubac considered it \"a work of genius\", and dedicated several pages of his study to explicate the relationship between Nietzsche's early thought and Christianity.\n\n\n (German)\n"}

{"id": "38421966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38421966", "title": "United States biological defense program", "text": "United States biological defense program\n\nThe United States biological defense program—in recent years also called the National Biodefense Strategy—began as a small defensive effort that paralleled the country's offensive biological weapons development and production program, active between 1943 and 1969. Organizationally, the medical defense research effort was pursued first (1956-1969) by the U.S. Army Medical Unit (USAMU) and later, after the discontinuation of the offensive program, by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). Both of these units were located at Fort Detrick, Maryland, where the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories were headquartered. The current mission is multi-agency, not exclusively military, and is purely to develop defensive measures against bio-agents, as opposed to the former bio-weapons development program.\n\nIn 1951, due to biological warfare concerns arising from the Korean War, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), a hands-on two-year postgraduate training program in epidemiology, with a focus on field work.\n\nSince the 2001 anthrax attacks, and the consequent expansion of federal bio-defense expenditures, USAMRIID has been joined at Fort Detrick by sister bio-defense agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NIAID's Integrated Research Facility) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center and the National Bioforensic Analysis Center). These—along with the much older Foreign Disease Weed Science Research Unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture—now constitute the National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research (NICBR).\n\nBroadly defined, the \"United States biological defense program\" now also encompasses all federal level programs and efforts to monitor, prevent, and contain naturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks of widespread public health concern. These include efforts to forestall large scale disasters such as flu pandemics and other \"emerging infections\" such as novel pathogens or those imported from other countries. Today, these U.S. biodefense programs—military and civilian—have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972.\n\nBiological agents have been used in warfare for centuries to produce death or disease in humans, animals, or plants. The United States officially began its biological warfare offensive program in 1941. During the next 28 years, the U.S. initiative evolved into an effective, military-driven research and acquisition program, shrouded in secrecy and, later, controversy. Most research and development was done at Fort Detrick, Maryland, while production and testing of bio-weapons occurred at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah. Field testing was done secretly and successfully with simulants and actual agents disseminated over wide areas. A small defensive effort always paralleled the weapons development and production program. With the presidential decision in 1969 to halt offensive biological weapons production—and the agreement in 1972 at the international BWC never to develop, produce, stockpile, or retain biological agents or toxins—the program became entirely defensive, with medical and non-medical components. The U.S. biological defense research program exists today, conducting research to develop physical and medical countermeasures to protect service members and civilians from the threat of modern biological warfare.\n\nBoth the U.S. bio-weapons ban and the BWC restricted any work in the area of biological warfare to defensive in nature. In reality, this gives BWC member-states wide latitude to conduct biological weapons research because the BWC contains no provisions for monitoring of enforcement. The treaty, essentially, is a gentlemen's agreement amongst members backed by the long-prevailing thought that biological warfare should not be used in battle.\n\nIn recent years certain critics have claimed the U.S. stance on biological warfare and the use of biological agents has differed from historical interpretations of the BWC. For example, it is said that the U.S. now maintains that the Article I of the BWC (which explicitly bans bio-weapons), does not apply to \"non-lethal\" biological agents. Previous interpretation was stated to be in line with a definition laid out in Public Law 101-298, the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989. That law defined a biological agent as: any micro-organism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product that may be engineered as a result of biotechnology, or any naturally occurring or bio-engineered component of any such microorganism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product, capable of causing death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or material of any kind... According to the Federation of American Scientists, U.S. work on non-lethal agents exceeds limitations in the BWC.\n\nAfter World War II, and with the onset of Cold War tensions, the US continued its clandestine wartime bio-weapons program. The Korean War (1950–53) added justification for continuing the program, when the possible entry of the Soviet Union into the war was feared. Concerns over the Soviet Union were justified, for the Soviet Union would pronounce in 1956 that chemical and biological weapons would, indeed, be used for mass destruction in future wars. In October 1950, the US Secretary of Defense approved continuation of the program, based largely on the Soviet threat and a belief that the North Korean and Chinese communists would use biological weapons. With expansion of the biological warfare retaliatory program, the scope of the defensive program was nearly doubled. Data were obtained on personnel protection, decontamination, and immunization. Early detection research produced prototype alarms for use on the battlefield, but progress was slow, apparently limited by technology.\n\nThe U.S. Army Medical Unit, under the direction of The U.S. Army Surgeon General, began formal operations in 1956. One of the Unit’s first missions was to manage all aspects of Project CD-22, the exposure of volunteers to aerosols containing a pathogenic strain of \"Coxiella burnetii\", the etiologic agent of Q fever. The volunteers were closely monitored and antibiotic therapy was administered when appropriate. All volunteers recovered from Q fever with no adverse aftereffects. One year later, the Unit submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration an Investigational New Drug application for a Q fever vaccine.\n\nIn the following decade, the US accumulated significant data on personnel protection, decontamination, and immunization; and, in the offensive program, on the potential for mosquitoes to be used as biological vectors. A new Department of Defense (DoD) Biological and Chemical Defense Planning Board was created in 1960 to establish program priorities and objectives. Preventive approaches toward infections of all kinds were funded under the auspices of biological warfare. As concern increased over the biological warfare threat during the Cold War, so did the budget for the program: to $38 million by fiscal year 1966.\n\nThe U.S. Army Chemical Corps was given the responsibility to conduct biological warfare research for all of the services. In 1962, the responsibility for the testing of promising biological warfare agents was given to a separate Testing and Evaluation Command (TEC). Depending on the particular program, different test centers were used, such as the Deseret Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah, the headquarters for the new biological and chemical warfare testing organization. In response to increasing concerns over public safety and the environment, the TEC implemented a complex system of approval of its research programs that included the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the President of the United States.\n\nDuring the last 10 years of the offensive research and development program (1959–69), many scientific advances were made that proved that biological warfare was clearly feasible, although dependent on careful planning, especially with regard to meteorological conditions. Large-scale fermentation, purification, concentration, stabilization, drying, and weaponization of pathogenic microorganisms could be done safely. Furthermore, modern principles of biosafety and containment were established at the Fort Detrick laboratories which have greatly facilitated biomedical research in general; still today, these are followed throughout the world. Arnold G. Wedum, M.D., Ph.D., a civilian scientist who was Director of Industrial Health and Safety at Fort Detrick, was the leader in the development of containment facilities.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the US program underwent a philosophical change, and attention was now directed more towards biological agents that could incapacitate, but not kill. In 1964, research programs involved staphylococcal enterotoxins capable of causing food poisoning. Research initiatives also included new therapy and prophylaxis. Pathogens studied included the agents causing anthrax, glanders, brucellosis, melioidosis, plague, psittacosis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Q fever, coccidioidomycosis, and a variety of plant and animal pathogens\n\nParticular attention was directed at chemical and biological detectors during the 1960s. The first devices were primitive field alarms to detect chemicals. Although the development of sensitive biological warfare agent detectors was at a standstill, two systems were, nonetheless, investigated. The first was a monitor that detected increases in the number of particles sized 1 to 5 µm in diameter, based on the assumption that a biological agent attack would include airborne particles of this size. The second system involved the selective staining of particles collected from the air. Both systems lacked enough specificity and sensitivity to be of any practical use.\n\nBut in 1966, a research effort directed at detecting the presence of adenosine triphosphate (a chemical found only in living organisms) was begun. By using a fluorescent material found in fireflies, preliminary studies indicated that it was possible to detect the presence of a biological agent in the atmosphere. The important effort to find a satisfactory detection system continues today, for timely detection of a biological attack would allow the attacked force to use its protective masks effectively, and identification of the agent would allow any pre-treatment regimens to be instituted. The US Army also experimented with and developed highly effective barrier protective measures against both chemical and biological agents. Special impervious tents and personal protective equipment were developed, including individual gas masks even for military dogs.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, funding for the biological warfare program decreased temporarily, to accommodate the accelerating costs of the Vietnam War. The budget for fiscal year 1969 was $31 million, decreasing to $11.8 million by fiscal year 1973. Although the offensive program had been stopped in 1969, both offensive and defensive programs continued to be defended. John S. Foster, Jr, Director of Defense Research and Engineering, responded to a query by Congressman Richard D. McCarthy:It is the policy of the U.S. to develop and maintain a defensive chemical-biological (CB) capability so that our military forces could operate for some period of time in a toxic environment, if necessary; to develop and maintain a limited offensive capability in order to deter all use of CB weapons by the threat of retaliation in kind; and to continue a program of research and development in this area to minimize the possibility of technological surprise.\n\nOn 25 November 1969, President Richard Nixon visited Fort Detrick to announce a new policy on biological warfare. In two National Security Memoranda, the U.S. government renounced all development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons and declared its intent to maintain only small research quantities of biological agents, such as are necessary for the development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics.\n\nGround was broken in 1967 for construction of a new, modern laboratory building at Fort Detrick. The building would open in phases during 1971 and 1972. With the disestablishment of the biological warfare laboratories, the name of the U.S. Army Medical Unit, which was to have been housed in the new laboratories, was formally changed to U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in 1969. The institute’s new mission was stated in General Order 137, 10 November 1971 (since superseded):Conducts studies related to medical defensive aspects of biological agents of military importance and develops appropriate biological protective measures, diagnostic procedures and therapeutic methods.\n\nThe emphasis now shifted away from offensive weapons to development of vaccines, diagnostic systems, personal protection, chemoprophylaxis, and rapid detection systems.\n\nAfter Nixon declared an end to the U.S. bio-weapons program, debate in the Army centered around whether or not toxin weapons were included in the president's declaration. Following Nixon's November 1969 order, scientists at Fort Detrick worked on one toxin, \"Staphylococcus\" enterotoxin type B (SEB), for several more months. Nixon ended the debate when he added toxins to the bio-weapons ban in February 1970\n\nIn response to Nixon’s 1969 decision, all antipersonnel biological warfare stocks were destroyed between 10 May 1971 and 1 May 1972. The laboratory at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas, was converted to a toxicological research laboratory, and was no longer under the direction or control of the DoD. Biological anticrop agents were destroyed by February 1973. Biological warfare demilitarization continued through the 1970s, with input provided by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; U.S. Department of the Interior; U.S. Department of Agriculture; and the Environmental Protection Agency. Fort Detrick and other installations involved in the biological warfare program took on new identities, and their missions were changed to biological defense and the development of medical countermeasures. The necessary containment capability, Biosafety Levels 3 and 4 (BSL-3 and BSL-4) continued to be maintained at USAMRIID.\n\nIn 1984, the DoD requested funds for the construction of another biological aerosol test facility in Utah. The proposal submitted by the army called for BSL-4 containment, although maintaining that the BSL-4 inclusion was based on a possible need in the future and not on a current research effort. The proposal was not well received in Utah, where many citizens and government officials still recalled the secretive projects of the military: the areas on DPG still contaminated with anthrax spores, and the well-publicized accidental chemical poisoning of a flock of sheep in Skull Valley, Utah, in March 1968. Questions arose over the safety of the employees and the surrounding communities, and a suggestion was even made to shift all biological defense research to a civilian agency, such as the National Institutes of Health. The plan for a new facility was revised to utilize a BSL-3 facility, but not before the US Congress had instituted more surveillance, reporting, and control measures on the army to ensure compliance with the BWC.\n\nIn the 1990s, the US medical biological defense research effort (part of the U.S. Army’s Biological Defense Research Program [BDRP]) was concentrated at USAMRIID at Fort Detrick. The army maintained state-of-the-art containment laboratory facilities there, with more than 10,000 ft2 of BSL-4 and 50,000 ft2 of BSL-3 laboratory space. BSL-4, the highest containment level, included laboratory suites that are isolated by internal walls and protected by rigorous entry restrictions, air-locks, negative-pressure air-handling systems, and filtration of all out-flow air through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. Workers in BSL-4 laboratories also wore filtered positive-pressure total body suits, which isolated the workers from the internal air of the laboratory. BSL-3 laboratories had a similar design, but do not require that personnel wear positive-pressure suits. Workers in BSL-3 suites were protected immunologically by vaccines. U.S. governmental standards provided guidance as to which organisms might be handled under various containment levels in laboratories such as USAMRIID.\n\nThe unique facilities available at USAMRIID also included a 16-bed clinical research ward capable of BSL-3 containment, and a 2-bed patient care isolation suite—the Medical Containment Suite (MCS), known as “The Slammer”—where ICU-level care could be provided under BSL-4 containment. Here, healthcare personnel wore the same positive-pressure suits as are worn in BSL-4 research laboratories. The level of patient isolation required depended on the infecting organism and the risk to healthcare providers. Patient care can be provided at BSL-4. There were no patient-care category analogous to BSL-3; humans who are ill as a result of exposure to BSL-3 agents were to be cared for in an ordinary hospital room with barrier nursing procedures.\n\nUSAMRIID guidelines were prepared to determine which level of containment would be employed for individual patients who required BSL-4 isolation or barrier nursing care. Staff augmentation for BSL-4 critical care expertise came from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Washington, D.C., in accordance with a memorandum of agreement between the two institutions. Patients could be brought directly into the BSL-4 suite from the outside through specialized ports with unique patient-isolation equipment. (The MCS was decommissioned and discontinued in December 2010.)\n\nAdditionally, starting in the 1970s USAMRIID maintained a unique evacuation capability known as the Aeromedical Isolation Team (AIT). Led by a physician and a registered nurse, each of the two teams consisted of eight volunteers who trained intensively to provide an evacuation capability for casualties suspected of being infected with highly transmissible, life-threatening BSL-4 infectious diseases (e.g., hemorrhagic fever viruses). The unit used special adult-sized Vickers isolation units (Vickers Medical Containment Stretcher Transit Isolator). These units were aircraft transportable and isolated a patient placed inside from the external environment. The AIT could transport two patients simultaneously; obviously, this was not designed for a mass casualty situation. During the 1995 outbreak of Ebola fever in Zaire, the AIT remained on alert to evacuate any US citizens who might have become ill while working to control the disease in that country.\n\nDuring this period, some biological defense research also continued at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense, Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Washington, D.C. USAMRIID and these sister laboratories conducted basic research in support of the medical component of the US biological defense research program, which developed strategies, products, information, procedures, and training for medical defense against biological warfare agents. The products included diagnostic reagents and procedures, drugs, vaccines, toxoids, and antitoxins. Emphasis is placed on protecting personnel before any potential exposure to the biological agent occurs.\n\nIn 1997, United States law formally defined weaponizable bio-agents as \"Biological Select Agents or Toxins\" (BSATs) — or simply Select Agents for short — which fall under the oversight of either the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (or both) and which have the \"potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety\".\n\nIn 1998, several DoD organizations consolidated to create the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), headquartered in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. This agency is DOD's official Combat Support Agency for countering weapons of mass destruction, including bio-agents. DTRA's main functions are threat reduction, threat control, combat support, and technology development. In the US national interest, DTRA supports projects at more than 14 locations around the world, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Ukraine.\n\nIn 1999, a \"National Pharmaceutical Stockpile\" — renamed Strategic National Stockpile in 2002 — was created under the oversight of DHHS. In the same year, the Laboratory Response Network — a collaborative effort within the US federal government involving the Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — was established to facilitate the confirmatory diagnosis and typing of possible bio-agents. Also in 1999, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13139, which provided for experimental anti-WMD drugs to be given to service members at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense only under informed consent; only the President may waive the necessity for informed consent.\n\nThree secret DoD projects involving countermeasures against anthrax – code named Project Bacchus, Project Clear Vision and Project Jefferson – were publicly disclosed by \"The New York Times\" in 2001. (The projects were undertaken between 1997 and 2000 and focused on the concern that the old Soviet BW program was secretly continuing and had developed a genetically modified anthrax weapon.)\n\nSince the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks, the US government has allocated nearly $50 billion to address the threat of biological weapons. Funding for bioweapons-related activities focuses primarily on research for and acquisition of medicines for defense. Biodefense funding also goes toward stockpiling protective equipment, increased surveillance and detection of bio-agents, and improving state and hospital preparedness. Significant funding goes to BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), part of DHHS. Funding for activities aimed at prevention has more than doubled since 2007 and is distributed among 11 federal agencies. Efforts toward cooperative international action are part of the project.\n\nA \"Select Agent Program\" (SAP) was established to satisfy requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administers the SAP, which regulates the laboratories that may possess, use, or transfer Select Agents within the United States. The Project Bioshield Act was passed by Congress in 2004 calling for $5 billion for purchasing vaccines that would be used in the event of a bioterrorist attack. According to President George W. Bush:Project BioShield will transform our ability to defend the nation in three essential ways. First, Project BioShield authorizes $5.6 billion over 10 years for the government to purchase and stockpile vaccines and drugs to fight anthrax, smallpox and other potential agents of bioterror. The DHHS has already taken steps to purchase 75 million doses of an improved anthrax vaccine for the Strategic National Stockpile. Under Project BioShield, HHS is moving forward with plans to acquire a safer, second generation smallpox vaccine, an antidote to botulinum toxin, and better treatments for exposure to chemical and radiological weapons.\n\nSince 2007, USAMRIID has been joined at Fort Detrick by sister bio-defense agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NIAID’s Integrated Research Facility) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center and the National Bioforensic Analysis Center). These—along with the much older Foreign Disease Weed Science Research Unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture—now constitute the National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research (NICBR).\n\nIn July 2012, the White House issued its guiding document on the \"National Biosurveillance Strategy\".\n\nSince biological warfare agents are often etiologic agents for naturally occurring diseases, the current military bio-defense research effort provides substantive benefits for civilian populations as well. Products currently being produced or under development through military research include:\n\n\n\nSome vaccines also have applicability for diseases of domestic animals (e.g., Rift Valley fever and Venezuelan equine encephalitis). In addition, vaccines are provided to persons who may be occupationally exposed to such agents (e.g., laboratory workers, entomologists, and veterinary personnel) throughout government, industry, and academe.\n\nUSAMRIID also provides diagnostic and epidemiological support to federal, state, and local agencies and foreign governments. Examples of assistance rendered to civilian health efforts by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) include:\n\n\nThe current research effort combines new technological advances, such as genetic engineering and molecular modeling, applying them toward development of prevention and treatment of diseases of military significance. The program is conducted in compliance with requirements set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Public Health Service, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Biological Weapons Convention.\n\nEven though the US stopped all offensive biological warfare research in 1969, US officials have continued to believe that its biological defense research program must remain strong in view of:\n\n\nWhile some of the military’s biological defense programs remain classified, based on worldwide threats and uncertainties, the medical biological defense research program is unclassified and is widely considered to be an invaluable resource for the country.\n\n"}
{"id": "32369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32369", "title": "Vagueness", "text": "Vagueness\n\nIn philosophy, vagueness refers to an important problem in semantics, metaphysics and philosophical logic. Definitions of this problem vary. A predicate is sometimes said to be vague if the bound of its extension is indeterminate, or appears to be so. The predicate \"is tall\" is vague because there seems to be no particular height at which someone becomes tall. Relatedly, a predicate is sometimes said to be vague if there are borderline cases of its application, such that in these cases competent speakers of the language may faultlessly disagree over whether the predicate applies. The disagreement over whether a hotdog is a sandwich suggests that “sandwich” is vague. \n\nVagueness is commonly introduced by the Sorites paradox. A standard form of this paradox features a 2000 man sequence of progressively taller men, starting with a paradigm case of a short man at one extreme, say George Costanza, and at the other extreme, a paradigm case of a tall one, say Kramer. \n\n\nSorites paradoxes exploit the intuition that some vague predicates are \"tolerant\" with respect to small enough differences on a dimension decisive of their application. This principle may seem to hold on the basis that (for example) no particular height is more justified than others in its vicinity as a cut-off for shortness. This intuition has been called the \"No Sharp Boundaries\" thesis about vague predicates and plays a prominent role in theories of vagueness. \n\nThe Sorites paradox dates to the fourth century BCE and is attributed to Eubulides of Melitus. It has received a resurgence of attention since 1975, when three papers published in \"Synthese\" effectively conceived the contemporary study of vagueness. \n\nThe problem posed by vagueness is to explain its particular kind of indeterminacy. Does vagueness render large portions of ordinary language meaningless? Likely not, since we frequently use vague language to great effect in ordinary discourse. If not, what \"is\" vagueness, at the level of predicate logic? How is it to be modeled without contradiction, and without sacrificing too much of classical logic? Is vagueness semantic, metaphysical or epistemic? \n\nVagueness has in its own right reaped the attention of an extensive literature. In addition, vagueness is a topic that touches many other questions in philosophy, linguistics and cognitive science, not to mention ordinary conversation. \n\nVagueness is philosophically important. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of \"right\" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances precising definitions.\n\nVagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept. Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc. Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as gender can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from transsexuals' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see intersex).\n\nMany scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance species in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as ring species. Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases. As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is \"vague\" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding huskies and wolves: are they dogs? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.\n\nThe philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is - which is closely related to the problem of the paradox of the heap, a.k.a. sorites paradox - has been the subject of much philosophical debate.\n\nOne theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between \"perfect falsity\", for example, the statement \"Bill Clinton is bald\", to \"perfect truth\", for, say, \"Patrick Stewart is bald\". In ordinary logics, there are only two truth-values: \"true\" and \"false\". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing \"an infinite number of truth-values\" along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by \"1\", and perfect falsity by \"0\". Borderline cases are thought of as having a \"truth-value\" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) and Dorothy Edgington (1993).\n\nAnother theoretical approach is known as \"supervaluationism\". This approach has been defended by Kit Fine and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of \"truth value gaps\". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be \"made precise\" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.\n\nGiven a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate 'supertrue' as meaning \"true on all precisifications\". This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. 'Frank is bald', where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the tautologies of sentential logic, such as 'Frank is bald or Frank is not bald', will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either 'Frank is bald' or 'Frank is not bald' will be true. Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can \"rescue\" them is seen as a virtue.\n\nSubvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or \"true on at least some precisifications\". \n\nSubvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has 'truth-value gluts'. According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon. Of a borderline case of 'bald man' it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.\n\nA fourth approach, known as the \"epistemicist view\", has been defended by Timothy Williamson (1994), R. A. Sorensen (1988) and (2001), and Nicholas Rescher (2009). They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is explained as being due to one's ignorance. For example, on the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old. It is just that one may sometimes be ignorant of this fact.\n\nOne possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague. Consider Peter Unger's example of a cloud (from his famous 1980 paper, \"The Problem of the Many\"): it's not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it's part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer. So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely. This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to Gareth Evans's short paper \"Can There Be Vague Objects?\" (1978). Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. \"Princeton = Princeton Borough\"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right. Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.\n\nStill by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving Leibniz's law or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, Peter van Inwagen (1990), Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).\n\nIn the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations. The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be \"void for vagueness\" and unenforceable. This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid \"explicit\" or \"objectionable\" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the vagueness doctrine and in Europe as the principle of legal certainty.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54382102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54382102", "title": "Vajrasati Yoga", "text": "Vajrasati Yoga\n\nVajrasati yoga is a style of yoga developed by Jim Tarran. It is influenced by his background in both Hatha and Iyengar yoga teaching. Vajrasati yoga uses asana, pranayama, breathwork and mudra as a means to lead students towards moksha or liberation as described in the fourth section of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. Classes emphasise attentive awareness of all levels of the self from the most apparent, physical level to the most subtle states in order to connect students to their own, intuitive intelligence.\n\nVajrasati is a composite word created by bringing together two words; Vajra (Pali - Vajira) from the Sanskrit word for thunderbolt, and the Pali word for mindfulness or recollection - Sati (Sanskrit -Smṛti.).\n\nThese two words from closely linked Indic languages (Sanskrit and Pali) were chosen in order to reference Vajrasati’s ideological links to early Buddhist meditation as well the wider Sanskrit tradition which includes later Buddhist schools as well as other yogic soteriologies such as Non-dual Shaiva Tantra (NDST), Patañjali's Yoga Sastra, and Advaita Vedanta.\n\nThe two languages also point to the school’s focus on the equal importance of action - as expressed through its emphasis on embodied means (sanskrit - anava upaya) represented by its strong focus on bodywork largely in the form of āsana or yogic postures (literally - seats) and on quietude manifested in more externally still forms of practice such as in seated meditation.\n\nVajrasati yoga was founded in 2000 by Jim Tarran who wanted to found a movement that could both enjoy the benefits of working with other people who would share experiences, resources, knowledge and peer to peer emotional support whilst avoiding the disadvantages of institutionalisation.\n\nTarran's proposed solution was to create a school that emphasised shared learning in which teachers trained in the school would be encouraged to follow the essential Buddhist principal of ehipassiko Pali for come and see (for yourself) and then share their findings with each other. In this environment Tarran believed information could be affirmed, refined, clarified and thus lead to more accurate knowledge.\n\nBorn April in 1970 Yoga alliance Senior Yoga Teacher (SYT) Jim Tarran began practicing yoga in 1990 after spending much of his teen years interested in the fringes of Eastern philosophy.\n\nHe graduated from the Patañjali Yoga School in Kathmandu in 1992, and the Iyengar school in 1996. In 2016 he was one of the very few teachers listed by name in the Top 20 Yoga Retreats in the World (The Times).\n\nHe has spent 27 years in the yoga world (at time of writing 2017), including sixteen years leading yoga teacher-training courses as well as numerous international yoga breaks and workshops. His classes are mostly based around the UK's South East especially Brighton, where he lives, and London.\n\nThe school seeks to achieve these ends through encouraging students to practice whilst exploring common yogic principles such as set out in the yamas and niyamas of Patañjali's sūtras. In particular; non-violence (ahimsa), honesty (satya), investigation (svādhyāya), and a sense of trust in a knowing (Sanskrit - Prajñā). According to Patanjali, this knowing is not stored or learned but more 'plugged into' (ishvara pranidhana). \n\nThe body is seen as a doorway into a richer experience of an interconnected holism - a journey described by its founder Jim Tarran as one from the finite, created, mind-made appearance of a divided universe into an experience of reality as infinite and self manifest (needing no creator or separate agency). In The Yoga Sutras, this is sometimes expressed as a Phoenix style disappearance or melting (Sanskrit - Laya) which generates an instant reemergence into a new and rich paradigm of being the knowing.\n\nClasses resemble many other Modern Postural Yoga (MPY) classes in terms of postures and the use of typical aids like blocks and belts when deemed useful. Classes emphasise personal experiences and exploration. There is also a strong emphasis on anatomy and experiential yoga philosophy.\nPranayama (In Sanskrit: Un-curbed energy) is an integral part of a Vajrasati Yoga practice and theory. It is viewed as a gateway to the integrated state of flow and is seen as equally and simultaneously running through the body, brain and breath. As with all approaches within the school the aim is to clear the channels so to give students an experience of direct knowing and its result a profound understanding of how and when to move correctly.\n\nThis symbiotic flow is achieved through an emphasis on non-violence and gracefulness, a letting go into a state of presence. This experience of Pranayama or free flow is also nudged, probed and teased through pranayama techniques (various breathing adjustments such as interrupted Breath (Sanskrit - Viloma), and Victorious breath. (Sanskrit - ujjayi) The school’s attitude is that through doing so, the practitioner will form a direct intimate relationship with this subtle energy and its flow or lack thereof.\nClass style can vary depending on abilities and the needs of students.\n\nVajrasati students are encouraged to feel the flow of life, intelligence and breath whilst in the postures in a way akin to that expressed in the Śhiva Sūtras \"karaṇaśaktiḥ svato' nubhavāt\" 'The power of performance, expression or action comes from the experience of what is truly one's own'. Students are therefore asked to\"Listen/Respond\". This is shorthand for accessing a sort of profound connection to the multifarious nuances of this moment through a process of disentanglement (Sanskrit - vairagya) and it's associated quietude. This connection results in spontaneous (Sanskrit - Sahaja) movements such as releases and explorative expansions into the body that come from a profound knowing that would otherwise be impaired by \" the noise of our own projections\".\nClasses can include any of the following common yoga techniques, postures, mantras, meditation, breathing exercises, mudras and are always student led in terms of the subtleties of when to move.\n\nJim Tarran and Khadine Morcom continue to train Vajrasati yoga teachers. There are currently 75 Vajrasati Yoga teachers in the UK (2017) with numbers now rising since the school expanded its training program into two new London locations in September 2016. Training as a Vajrasati yoga teacher, who are known as Vajrasatins, takes two years on average with additional training required following graduation. The school is certified as a 500 hour course with The Yoga Alliance.\n"}
{"id": "2077425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2077425", "title": "When a white horse is not a horse", "text": "When a white horse is not a horse\n\nWhen A White Horse Is Not A Horse (), also known as the White Horse Dialogue (), is a famous paradox in Chinese philosophy. Gongsun Long wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is \"white horse not horse\" permissibly assertible?'.\n\nThe White Horse Dialogue (\"Baima Lun\") constitutes chapter 2 of the eponymous \"Gongsun Longzi\" \"Master Gongsun Long\", who was counted among the \"School of Names\" (aka \"Logicians\" or \"Dialecticians\") in the Hundred Schools of Thought. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received \"Gongsun Longzi\" text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.\nIs \"\" assertible?\n\nAdvocate: It is.\n\nObjector: How?\n\nAdvocate: \"Horse\" is that by means of which one names the shape. \"White\" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may \"white horse not horse.\"\n\nObjector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?\n\nAdvocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.\nThis dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether \"white\" and \"horse\" can be separated from \"white horse\".\n\nOther \"Gongsun longzi\" chapters discuss \"Baima\"-related concepts of \"jian\" \"hard; hardness\" and \"bai\" \"white; whiteness\", \"ming\" \"name; term\" and \"shi\" \"solid; true, actual; fact, reality\", and abstract \"zhi\" \"finger; pointing; designation; universal\" like \"whiteness\" and concrete \"wu\" \"thing; object; particular\" like a \"white horse\".\n\nThe Chinese of \"a white horse is not a horse\" is \"bai ma fei ma\" 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the negative \"fei\" \"not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong\". The Classical construction \"A \"fei\" B\" \"A非B\" can ambiguously mean either \"A is not a member of the class B\" or \"A is not identical to B\". Interpreting this equivocation fallacy, A.C. Graham says this \"white horse\" vs. \"horse\" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether \"is\" means:\n\nIn other words, the expression \"a white horse is not a horse\" is ambiguous between \"a white horse is not identical with a horse\" (true, because \"white horse\" is more specific than \"horse\"), and \"a white horse is not a member of the set of horses\" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that \"a white horse is not [identical with] a horse,\" while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as \"a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses.\"\n\nAn illustration of the alternative uses of \"fei\" may be found in the widely known \"Happiness of Fish\" dialogue in \"Zhuangzi\" (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says \"You're not a fish [子非魚] — how do you know what fish enjoy?\" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies \"You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?\" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).\n\nBeyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of \"Baima fei ma\", the first line obscurely asks \"ke hu\" \"Can it be that …?\". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. Bryan W. Van Norden suggests that \"the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' \"could\" be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse \"is\" a horse.' \"\n\nAn alternative interpretation is offered in Feng Youlan's \"History of Chinese Philosophy \"(translated in 1952 by Derk Bodde):\n\nStrictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.\n\nHowever, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to Feng Youlan's interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham, Hansen, Harbsmeier, Thompson, and Van Norden.\n\nIn the Chinese philosophical tradition, the \"Baima Lun\"'s significance is evident from how many Chinese classic texts directly or indirectly discuss it. The \"Liezi\", which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as \"perversions of reason and sense\", explains \"'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape.\"\n\nTwo \"Zhuangzi\" chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his \"zhi\" 指 \"attribute\" and \"ma\" 馬 \"horse\" notions in the same context.\nTo use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.\n\nThe \"Mengzi\" (6A4) notes that \"bai\" 白 \"white\" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):\nMencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness?

Traditionally, popular White Day gifts are cookies, jewelry, white chocolate, white lingerie, and marshmallows. Sometimes the term is used to describe the generally recited rule for men that the return gift should be two to three times the worth of the Valentine's gift.\n\nWhite Day was first celebrated in 1978 in Japan. It was started by the National Confectionery Industry Association as an \"answer day\" to Valentine's Day on the grounds that men should pay back the women who gave them chocolate and other gifts on Valentine's Day. In 1977, a Fukuoka-based confectionery company, Ishimuramanseido, marketed marshmallows to men on March 14, calling it .\n\nSoon thereafter, confectionery companies began marketing white chocolate. Now, men give both white and dark chocolate, as well as other edible and non-edible gifts, such as jewelry or objects of sentimental value, or white clothing like lingerie, to women from whom they received chocolate on Valentine's Day one month earlier. Flowers and other gifts are also given on this day. Eventually, this practice spread to the neighboring East Asian countries of South Korea, China, Taiwan and Vietnam. In those cultures, White Day is for the most part observed in a similar manner.\n\nAs a note in Japan, if chocolate given to a man a month prior was \"giri choco\", the man may not be expressing actual romantic interest, but rather a social obligation.\n\n"}

He graduated from the Harvard Divinity School in 1823. At the age of 22 he became the minister of the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, which had operated without a minister for 29 years. He served there from 1825 until his retirement in 1875. The congregation grew substantially during his ministry, moving to a larger building in 1828. It moved to a still larger building in 1886, which was designed by his son Frank.\n\nFurness was an ardent abolitionist whose attacks on the Fugitive Slave Act led to a discussion at a cabinet meeting of President James Buchanan about the possibility of indicting him for treason.\nHe was a prominent speaker at the Martyr Day vigil in Philadelphia in 1859, which marked the execution of John Brown, who had attempted to spark a slave uprising in the South.\nAfter abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner was severely beaten on the floor of the Senate by Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina, he stayed at the Furness home during part of his convalescence.\n\nFurness was a student of the life of Jesus, about whom he published several books. He asserted that the miracles attributed to Jesus in the Christian Bible were natural events with rational explanations.\nHe rejected traditional beliefs about Jesus' miraculous birth, saying, \"these stories may have been pure fictions ... [or] they were exaggerations of certain simple and very natural incidents, magnified by wonder.\"\n\nFurness promoted outreach to the Jewish community in Philadelphia. His son Frank was the architect for the new building for Congregation Rodeph Shalom.\n\nHe married Annis P. Jenks of Salem, Massachusetts in 1825.
