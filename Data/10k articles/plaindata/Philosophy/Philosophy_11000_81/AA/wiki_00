Essentially, despite his respect for mathematics and science, he pioneered the French movement of scepticism towards the use of scientific methods to understand human nature and metaphysical reality. Positivism, of which, for example, the French sociologist Durkheim was interested in at the time, was not appropriate, he argued. Unlike later philosophers, Bergson was highly influenced by biology, particularly Darwin's \"Origin of Species\", which was released the year of Bergson's birth. This led Bergson to discuss the 'Body' and 'Self' in detail, arguably prompting the fundamental ontological and epistemological questions to be raised later in the 20th century. Bergson's work was a major influence on Gilles Deleuze, who wrote a monograph on him (\"Bergsonism\") and whose philosophical analyses of cinema (\"\" and \"\") develop his ideas.\n\nFollowing debates concerning the foundation of mathematics around the mathematician and philosopher Henri Poincaré (1854–1912), who opposed Bertrand Russell and Frege, various French philosophers started working on philosophy of science, among them Gaston Bachelard, who developed a discontinuist view of science, Jean Cavaillès (1903–1944), Jules Vuillemin (1920-2001), or Georges Canguilhem, who would be a strong influence of Michel Foucault ; in his introduction to Canguilhem's \"The Normal and the Pathological\", Foucault wrote:\n\nTake away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about Althusser, Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists such as Bourdieu, Robert Castel, Jean-Claude Passeron and what marks them so strongly within sociology; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical work done by psychoanalysts, particularly by the followers of Lacan. Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the movement of '68, it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, Bruno Latour (b. 1947), teacher at the engineering school \"École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris\", would develop the actor-network theory, a distinctive approach to social theory and research, best known for its controversial insistence on the agency of nonhumans.\n\nMany philosophers and historians of philosophy were teachers at the Sorbonne, the University of Paris, including Léon Brunschvicg (1869–1944), co-founder of the \"Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale\" with Xavier Léon and Elie Halévy, Martial Guéroult (1891–1976) and successor of Étienne Gilson at the Collège de France in 1951, Ferdinand Alquié, Paul Ricœur, etc. Jean Wahl taught between 1936 and 1967 and helped introduce the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard to French thinkers.\n\nEmmanuel Mounier (1905–1950) was a guiding spirit in the French personalist movement, and founder and director of \"Esprit\", the magazine which was the organ of the movement. Mounier, who was the child of peasants, was a brilliant scholar at the Sorbonne. In 1929, when he was only twenty-four, he came under the influence of the French writer, Charles Péguy, to whom he ascribed the inspiration of the personalist movement.\n\nGabriel Honoré Marcel (1889–1973) was a leading Catholic existentialist and the author of about 30 plays. He shared a great deal in common with Mounier's ideas. They both show Bergson's influence in their assessment of 'being', specifically the Mystery of Being. Interest of Mounier and Marcel in the problems of technology moved French philosophy forward.\n\nSartre (1905–1980) was, if only by birth, the first truly 20th-century French philosopher. He was probably also the most famous, as a dramatist, screenwriter, novelist and critic. Sartre popularized (and named) existentialism, making it better known to the lay-person than, for instance, deconstruction. Phenomenology and Marxism were two other key concerns of his. A leading figure of the French Left, Sartre was opposed on his right by Raymond Aron.\n\nMaurice Merleau Ponty (1908–1961) was a French phenomenologist philosopher, strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl. Merleau-Ponty is classified as an existentialist thinker because of his close association with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and his distinctly Heideggerian conception of Being.\n\nIt is important to realise that, as well as holding many varying degrees and interpretations of Marxism, many French Philosophers' views on it shifted substantially during their lifetime. Sartre, for instance, became more influenced by Marx during the course of his life.\n\nAlexandre Kojève (1902–1968) was a Marxist and Hegelian political philosopher, who had a substantial influence on intellectual life in France in the 1930s and on the reading of Hegel in France.\n\nLouis Althusser (1918–1990) was a key Marxist philosopher, sometimes considered to be the structuralist equivalent to Marxism that Lacan was to Psychoanalysis and Claude Lévi-Strauss to ethnology (although all of them rejected the identification).In 'Lenin and Philosophy', Althusser explained Lenin's differentiation between [Dialectical Materialism] and [Historical Materialism]. He said the former was the philosophy and the latter was the science, and claimed that in history science has always preceded Philosophy. One of his seminal works was \"Reading Capital\" (1965), co-written with Étienne Balibar, Roger Establet, Jacques Rancière and Pierre Macherey. He opposed Hegel's teleological approach to history, drew on Bachelard's concept of \"epistemological break\" and defined philosophy as \"class struggle in theory.\"\n\nOther Marxist authors include Henri Lefebvre (1901–1999), who partly influenced the Situationist and Guy Debord, the group \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\" aforementioned, Althusser's students Etienne Balibar (author of [The Philosophy of Marx]), Jacques Rancierre, and perhaps most prominently, Alain Badiou. Badiou's most well-known work is undoubtedly [Being and Event], but his analysis of the May 68 revolts in [The Communist Hypothesis] is well known as well. Recently, Slavoj Zizek has gained prominence as a French Marxist of Slovene origin, primarily for his re-reading of Marx using Lacan and Hegel.\n\nThe structuralist movement in French philosophy was highly influenced by the Swiss thinker Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913). His ideas laid the foundation for many of the significant developments in linguistics in the 20th century. He is widely considered the 'father' of 20th-century linguistics.\n\nThis current was further explored by Claude-Levi Strauss in ethnology. His work influenced important figures like Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan significantly. From 1963, a magazine was run in Paris, called Tel Quel, which also dabbled excessively in structuralist analysis of texts. Important figures in this endeavour were Phillip Sollers, the magazine's editor, Julia Kristeva and Roland Barthes.\n\nJacques Lacan (1901–1981) was specifically interested in the philosophy of psychoanalysis. He could be said to be relevant to the more modern foundations of discursive psychology.\n\nPost-structuralism is, like structuralism, an ambiguous term in some respect. It is first important to understand the nature of the schools of thought - as often it seems they aren't truly separate 'schools' at all. Much like Sartre's interest in art, both of these movements are important to a wide range of academic disciplines. E.g., English literature, cultural studies, media studies/film studies, anthropology, etc. etc.\n\nMichel Foucault (1926–1984), although sometimes considered close to structuralism, quickly drew apart from this movement, developing a specific approach to semiology and history which he dubbed \"archeology.\" His influence is broad-ranging, and his work includes books such as \"Madness and Civilization\" (1961), \"The Order of Things\" (1966), \"Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison\" (1975) or \"The History of Sexuality\".\n\nGilles Deleuze, who wrote the \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972) with Félix Guattari, criticizing psychoanalysis, was, like Foucault, one of the key thinkers who introduced a thorough reading of Nietzsche in France, following Georges Bataille's early attempts — Bataille published the \"Acéphale\" review from 1936 to 1939, along with Pierre Klossowski, another close reader of Nietzsche, Roger Caillois and Jean Wahl. Deleuze wrote books such as \"Difference and Repetition\", \"The Logic of Sense\", \"\" (1970), and also wrote on Bergson, Leibniz, Nietzsche, etc., as well as other works on cinema (\"\"). Both Deleuze and Foucault attempted to take distance from the strong influence of Marxism and psychoanalysis in their works, in part by means of a radical reinterpretation of Marx and Freud.\n\nJacques Derrida (1930–2004) was an Algerian-born French philosopher, known as the founder of deconstruction. His voluminous work had a profound impact upon continental philosophy and literary theory.\n\nJean-François Lyotard (1924–1998) was a philosopher and literary theorist. He is well known for his articulation of Postmodernism after the late 1970s.\n\nOther authors include Jean Baudrillard, who started with a situationist criticism of Consumption Society in the 1970s to evolve towards a reflection on simulation and virtual reality, Paul Virilio, both a philosopher and an urbanist, Cornelius Castoriadis, who was, along with Claude Lefort, co-founder of \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\" and criticized orthodox Marxism, Alain Badiou, François Laruelle, who developed \"Non-philosophy\" starting in the 1980s, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Paul Ricoeur (administrator of the University of Nanterre during May '68), Emmanuel Levinas, Vincent Descombes, etc.\n\nThe Feminist movement in contemporary France (or at least that which can be placed in the 'Philosophy' genre) is characterised more by deconstructionism and Marxism than much Anglo-American Feminism. Key thinkers include psychoanalytic and cultural theorist Luce Irigaray (born 1930), psychoanalyst and writer Julia Kristeva (born 1941), writer and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, writer and cultural theorist Helen Cixous and artist and psychoanalyst Bracha Ettinger.\n\nOne suggested way of understanding French philosophy of this period, it has been suggested, is to locate the major influential figures in their current. The major influences were primarily 6 Germans from preceding eras - Hegel, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger. For example, Alexander Kojeve's Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit were quite a sensation in Paris in the 1930s. It was attended by George Batailles and a young Jacques Lacan among others. Jean Wahl and Jean Hippolyte were also responsible for spreading Hegel's lectures into Parisian circles.\n\nMarx was introduced to philosophers both inside and outside the university. Many, like Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, grew up during the Resistance against Nazi occupation, during which time they were introduced to Marxist-Leninists.\n\nNietzsche's influence went through George Batailles and the Acephale group, down to Foucault and Deleuze. The Acephale group is partly responsible for reclaiming Nietzsche for Western Philosophy, after decades of Nazi appropriation.\n\nHeidegger and Husserl's influence was felt, firstly, in the existential-phenomenology of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Even Simon de Beauvoir's feminism borrowed extensively from this current. She used phenomenological conceptualizations of consciousness, time and memory to conceptualize Woman. Later, most famously, Jacques Derrida deconstructed Husserl in Of Grammatology.\n\nFinally, Freud was most avidly championed by Jacques Lacan's \"return to Freud\". Lacan's lectures caused a stir in Parisian intellectual circles akin to Alexander Kojeve's a generation earlier. Attended only by clinical trainees at first, as time wore on Lacan opened up his seminars to philosophers and artists of various kinds. Lacan's writings impacted the whole generation - while Louis Althusser found the theoretical apparatus in Lacan to talk about interpellation and ideology, Jacques Alain Miller, Althusser's student at first, would go on to become Lacan's most devoted follower. The French Feminists - Irigaray, Kristeva, Cixous, responded to Lacan in various ways, and perhaps most famously, Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus presented a strong critique of the practise of psychoanalysis.\n\n20th century French philosophers lived through several very important political upheavals during their time. On the one hand, there was the Resistance against the Nazi forces. For Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, this was the first introduction to communism. Later, they would both become members of the PCF. The other important political event of that era was the Algerian War of Independence, to which the young Foucault, Derrida and Frantz Fanon went. While the PCF had a problematic role to play, dissident Marxist-Leninists of that era went there to help rebelling Algerians. Undoubtedly, for the next generation, the great political upheaval was the student-worker protests of May 1968. Young radicals, from the Sorborne and Ecole Normale Supérieure organized, went to the factories and encouraged the worker's to go on strike. Many young radicals broke away from Marxism–Leninism towards Maoism at this point, while there were several Anarchists, Trotskyites, Situationists etc. at the protests as well.\n\nEach of these events have shaped the content as well as the form of the writing of these French philosophers. Time and again, the movements have questioned the French state, the university, imperialism and capitalism as well. This has provided impetus, material and structural change to the current of French philosophy consistently.\n\n"}

It is the negative of Bhava which means being, becoming, existing or appearance.\n\nUddayana divides \"Padārtha\" (Categories) into \"Bhava\" (existence) which is real, and \"Abhava\" (non-existence) which is not real. \"Dravya\" (substance), \"Guṇa\" (quality), \"Karma\" (action), \"Samanya\" (community or generality), \"Visesa\" (particularity or partimerity) and \"Samavaya\" (inherence) are the marks of existence. \"Abhava\" has not been categorically defined by the Vaisheshika School of Hindu philosophy but is of four kinds viz – 1) \"Pragabhava\" i.e. Prior non-existence, 2) \"Pradhvamsabhava\" i.e. Posterior non-existence, 3) \"Atyantabhava\" i.e. Absolute non-existence, and 4) \"Anyonyabhava\" i.e. Mutual non-existence.\n\n\nThe process with which the sound value collapses into the point value of the gap existing between the first and the next syllable of the first letter of the Rigveda, \"Agnim\", is \"Pradhvamsabhava\", the silent point of all possibilities within the gap is \"Atyantabhava\", the structuring dynamics of what happens within the gap \"Anyonyabhava\", and the mechanics by which the sound emerges from the point value of the gap i.e. emergence of the following syllable, is \"Pragabhava\"; this mechanism is inherent in both syllables.\n\nThe Vaisheshika, the Nyaya, the Bhatta Mimamsa and Dvaita schools hold \"Abhava\" as a distinct category. Recognised as a reality by the Nyaya school, \"Abhava\" is often stated to be the reality of the greatest moment in the pluralistic universe and is connected with Mukti. It is a relative word, for there can be \"abhava\" only when previously there is \"bhava\"; moreover it is an event occurring in time. The Nyaya and the Siddhantin maintain that the cognition of \"abhava\" is due to perception involving special kind of contact or sense contact. \n\n\"Abhava\" is that unmanifest level from where the concrete \"Bhava\" arises or emerges. Vasubandhu has referred to \"Sunyata\" having the characteristic of the own-being of \"abhava\", rather than a characteristic consisting of \"bhava\" which Sthiramati observes is in fact not redundant, which means \"abhava\" does not negate \"bhava\". \"Abhava\" refers to particular entities and not to Being ; it is a theoretical or logical denial of the existence of some particular impossibility.\nThe acceptance of abhava as an independent padartha having ontological reality of its own is a peculiar feature of Indian philosophical tradition. Dharmakirti considered \"abhava\" as an \"anumana\". He had brought in the idea of imaginary presence of that whose absence was apprehended in order to explain the specificity of the absence.\n"}

He wrote several books in Urdu. His works included novels, short stories and plays for television and radio. He was awarded President's Pride of Performance and Sitara-i-Imtiaz for meritorious services in the field of literature and broadcasting.\n\nAhmed was born on 22 August 1925 in Muktsar, Punjab, British India, into an ethnic Pashtun family of the Momand tribe. He obtained his early education in his native district of Muktsar. Shortly before independence in 1947, he migrated to Pakistan and settled in Lahore, Punjab. He completed his Masters in Urdu literature from Government College Lahore. Bano Qudsia, his wife and companion in Urdu literary circles, was his classmate at the Government College.\n\nAfter Partition, when Ahmed arrived at the Walton refugee camp with millions of other migrants, he used to make announcements of directions on a megaphone around the clock for the refugees. Later, he got a job in 'Radio Azad Kashmir', which was established on a truck that used to drive around in various parts of Kashmir. He then got lectureship at Dayal Singh College, Lahore for two years. Whereafter, he went to Rome to join 'Radio Rome' as an Urdu newscaster. He also used to teach Urdu at 'Rome University'. During his stay in Europe, he received diplomas in the Italian and French languages from the 'Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome' and University of Grenoble, France. He also earned a special training diploma in radio broadcasting from New York University.\n\nHe started writing stories in his childhood, which were published in \"Phool\" [Flower] magazine. After returning to Pakistan from Europe, he took out his own monthly literary magazine, Dastaango [Story Teller], and joined Radio Pakistan as a script writer. He was made editor of the popular Urdu weekly, Lail-o-Nahar [Day and Night], in place of famous poet Sufi Ghulam Mustafa Tabassum by the Government of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1962, Ahmed started his popular radio program, Talqeen Shah [The Preacher] which made him immensely popular among the people in towns and villages. He was appointed director of the Markazi Urdu Board in 1966, which was later renamed as Urdu Science Board, a post he held for 29 years. He remained with the board until 1979. He also served as adviser in the Education Ministry during Zia-ul-Haq's regime.\n\nAhmed, in his later years of life, was greatly inclined towards Sufism. His close association with Qudrat Ullah Shahab and Mumtaz Mufti was also attributed to this tendency.

It is told that when the sage was in his mother's womb, his father Kagola made several mistakes while reciting the Vedas. Hearing these, the unborn sage laughed. The father became enraged and cursed his son to be born as Astavakra. So it came to pass that he was born crooked in eight places. These crooks earned him the name Ashtavakra or Eight Crooks. Yet Kagola was later defeated in a philosophical debate with Vandin, the court scholar. While still a boy the sage, a natural scholar of great ability went to court and avenged his father's defeat by beating Vandin in argument and becoming the guru of Janaka.

In the year 1141 AD, Acharya Shri Jin Dutt Suri Ji, who Jains respectfully call Dada Guru Dev, segregated the Jain society into 499 sects or cults, called Gotras. These were like small families within the larger purview of the Jain society as such. The Gadia cult is one of those 499 cults and is in perennial existence for the past 900 years.\n\nIt is believed that the ruler of Chanderi, \"King Khardar Singh Rathore\" was extremely impressed by the thoughts and ideas of Shri Dada Guru Dev Ji and subsequently adopted the Jain religion. King Khardar Singh had a son called \"Bhainsay Shah\". King Bhainsay Shah’s fifth son was named \"Gadhaiye Shah\" and it is from him that the Gadia gotra got its name as \"Gadia\". Venerable Shri Baba Dittu Ji is believed to be the Guru of the Gadia clan and is therefore eternally associated with the Gadia society.\n\nThe Gadia family started expanding and reached out to different parts of India, primarily the north-western Indian state of Punjab. A large section of the community got settled in the city of Sialkot in Punjab (present day Pakistan). It is from Sialkot, that the Gadia family grew exponentially in size, prestige and influence. Slowly, the cultural influence of Punjab overshadowed the Rajasthani roots of Gadia society and it became a predominantly \"Punjabi\" society. The language, customs, traditions, festivals - all gained a Punjabi touch and the Gadia community accepted it with open arms. However, the overarching Jain faiths continued to be in place, as strong as a Rock, and ensured that the Gadia community maintained its own identity of \"Jains\" within the \"Punjabi\" culture. The key Jain ethics and beliefs in vegetarianism, non-violence, non-indulgence continued to be unshaken and undeterred all this while.\n\nAs we approached the era which of modern history, the community expanded further and moved to other parts of India, but the hub continued to be Sialkot. Then came that tragic event in the history of India which divided us into two separate nations – India and Pakistan. Politics played its dirty game and the India-Pakistan partition happened in 1947. This drove almost all members of the Gadia community out of Sialkot and other parts of the present day Pakistan. Many members of the community left everything back in Pakistan and travelled to different parts of India as refugees. Among all parts of India, most of the Gadia families moved to the cities of Jammu, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Meerut and Delhi. Although many families had to start from scratch, by the grace of Baba Dittu Ji, all recovered and re-established themselves in their new homes. As a result, today, the Gadia families are one of the most affluent and economically successful families in the Jain society and have their presence throughout India and many parts of the world.\n\n\"Venerable Shri Baba Dittu Ji\" is the ultimate Guru of the Gadia clan. He is believed to be the protector, the preserver, the very guardian of the Gadia society. He continues to be the guiding light behind the Gadia gotra and this eternal association between Baba Dittu Ji and the Gadia clan is at the very crux of the Gadia faith. His image resides in the heart of every member of the Gadia family and their loyalty to Baba Dittu Ji is absolute and supreme in nature. Members of the Gadia clan say that their hands fold and their heads bow down in devotion to Baba Dittu Ji. This faith, this conviction, this belief in Baba Dittu Ji is unequivocal and ceaseless in every member of the Gadia clan.\n\nTo this date, whenever someone in Gadia families embarks on a journey, he/she makes it a point to remember Baba Dittu Ji in the heart for a safe and successful journey. Any festival, any auspicious event starts with remembering and meditating on Baba Dittu Ji. Remembering Baba Dittu Ji during birth ceremonies and wedding ceremonies is a tradition which has become a part of the Gadia way of life. In case of any trouble, any danger, Baba Dittu Ji is considered to be their ultimate savior. It is believed that when a person is under his divine blessing, nothing can go wrong.\n\nMany times, we do come across such events which are beyond the scope of human explanation. We can either call them super-natural or simply inexplicable. But these are the moments when we realize that there really is some force which spans beyond our definition of the laws of nature. They take us to a new dimension of super-consciousness and convince us to believe in something that we don’t explicitly see. Shri Baba Dittu Ji has that power, that divine enigma to make people believe in those mystical connotations which would ordinarily be considered impossible. The Gadia community believes that Baba Dittu Ji has demonstrated his heavenly presence on many occasions, which break all shackles of disbelief. They believe that his image transcends all barriers of human imagination.\n\nThe temples dedicated to \"Venerable Shri Baba Dittu Ji\" are referred to as \"Tomri Mandirs\". These Tomris are considered to be the adobes of the divine grace of Baba Dittu Ji. The first Tomri mandir was established in Sialkot (in present-day Pakistan), and is obviously beyond the reach of present-day Gadia families (since most of them are in India now). However, there are three Tomri Mandirs in India which attract hundreds of Gadia families every day of the year. These tomris are located in Jammu, Ludhiana and Delhi.\n\nJammu Tomri\nIn the year 1920, some Gadia families brought certain components from the Sialkot Tomri and established a Tomri Mandir at Jammu. The Jammu Tomri, thus remains the first and the oldest Tomri in India. It is located in a beautiful campus in Talaab Tillon area of Jammu.\n\nLudhiana Tomri\nThe Ludhiana Tomri is located in a large, beautiful, green campus at village Kanech in Sahnewal district near Ludhiana (Punjab). The Ludhiana tomri is considered to be especially sacred since it is believed that Baba Dittu Ji appeared at this tomri in \"Naag (snake) form\". This tomri mandir has a large, full-wall photograph that was taken when Baba Ji appeared there in his divine manifestation of the snake.\n\nDelhi Tomri\nThe Delhi Tomri was envisioned in the year 1998. Construction started in the year 2000 after much deliberations with the Delhi government over allotment of land. On 25 January 2004, members of the Delhi Gadia community went to Jammu and brought some soil from the Jammu Tomri, as Baba Ji’s blessing. On 2 May 2004, the Tomri Mandir was formally inaugurated and made available to the Gadia families. Regular monthly events take place at the Tomri which ensures that the Gadia community remains connected in its devotion to Shri baba Dittu Ji.\n\nMore details and contact information of the Tomri temples can be found at http://www.babadittuji.com/tomri-mandirs.html\n\nBaba Dittu Ji's Prayer (text): http://www.babadittuji.com/baba-ji-ki-aarti-text.html\nBaba Dittu Ji's Prayers (audio): https://soundcloud.com/#babadittuji/sets/baba-dittu-ji-ke-bhajan \n\nMuni Lal Gadia - Nagina Devi Family (website): http://www.gadia.info/\n\nBaba Dittu Ji's website: http://www.babadittuji.com\n"}

{"id": "275053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275053", "title": "Coherentism", "text": "Coherentism\n\nCoherentism is the name given to a few philosophical theories in modern epistemology.\n\nThere are two distinct types of coherentism. One is the coherence theory of truth; the other, the coherence theory of justification (also known as epistemic coherentism). Coherent truth is divided between an anthropological approach, which applies only to localized networks ('true within a given sample of a population, given our understanding of the population'), and an approach that is judged on the basis of universals, such as categorical sets. The anthropological approach belongs more properly to the correspondence theory of truth, while the universal theories are a small development within analytic philosophy. The coherentist theory of justification, which may be interpreted as relating to either theory of coherent truth, characterizes epistemic justification as a property of a belief only if that belief is a member of a coherent set. What distinguishes coherentism from other theories of justification is that the set is the primary bearer of justification. As an epistemological theory, coherentism opposes dogmatic foundationalism and also infinitism through its insistence on definitions. It also attempts to offer a solution to the regress argument that plagues correspondence theory. In an epistemological sense, it is a theory about how belief can be proof-theoretically justified.\n\nCoherentism is a view about the structure and system of knowledge, or else justified belief. The coherentist's thesis is normally formulated in terms of a denial of its contrary, such as dogmatic foundationalism, which lacks a proof-theoretical framework, or correspondence theory, which lacks universalism. Counterfactualism, through a vocabulary developed by David K. Lewis and his many worlds theory although popular with philosophers, has had the effect of creating wide disbelief of universals amongst academics. Many difficulties lie in between hypothetical coherence and its effective actualization. Coherentism claims, at a minimum, that not all knowledge \"and\" justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of noninferential knowledge \"or\" justified belief. To defend this view, they may argue that conjunctions (\"and\") are more specific, and thus in some way more defensible, than disjunctions (\"or\").\n\nAfter responding to foundationalism, coherentists normally characterize their view positively by replacing the foundationalism metaphor of a building as a model for the structure of knowledge with different metaphors, such as the metaphor that models our knowledge on a ship at sea whose seaworthiness must be ensured by repairs to any part in need of it. This metaphor fulfills the purpose of explaining the problem of incoherence, which was first raised in mathematics. Coherentists typically hold that justification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of which are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by dogmatic foundationalists. In this way universal truths are in closer reach. Different varieties of coherentism are individuated by the specific relationship between a system of knowledge and justified belief, which can be interpreted in terms of predicate logic, or ideally, proof theory.\n\nAs a theory of truth, coherentism restricts \"true\" sentences to those that cohere with some specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true if and only if it is \"coherent\" with all or most of his or her other (true) beliefs. The terminology of coherence is then said to correlate with truth via some concept of what qualifies all truth, such as absoluteness or universalism. These further terms become the qualifiers of what is meant by a truth statement, and the truth-statements then decide what is meant by a true belief. Usually, coherence is taken to imply something stronger than mere consistency. Statements that are comprehensive and meet the requirements of Occam's razor are usually to be preferred.\n\nAs an illustration of the principle, if people lived in a virtual reality universe, they could see birds in the trees that aren't really there. Not only are the birds not really there, but the trees aren't really there either. The people may or may not \"know\" that the bird and the tree are there, but in either case there is a coherence between the virtual world and the real one, expressed in terms of true beliefs within available experience. \"Coherence\" is a way of explicating truth values while circumventing beliefs that might be false in any way. More traditional critics from the correspondence theory of truth have said that it cannot have contents and proofs at the same time, unless the contents are infinite, or unless the contents somehow exist in the form of proof. Such a form of 'existing proof' might seem ridiculous, but coherentists tend to think it is non-problematic. It therefore falls into a group of theories that are sometimes deemed excessively generalistic, what Gabor Forrai calls 'blob realism'. \n\nPerhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is Bertrand Russell's argument concerning contradiction. Russell maintained that a belief and its negation will each separately cohere with one complete set of all beliefs, thus making it internally inconsistent. For example, if someone holds a belief that is false, how might we determine whether the belief refers to something real although it is false, or whether instead the right belief is true although it is not believed? Coherence must thus rely on a theory that is either non-contradictory or accepts some limited degree of incoherence, such as relativism or paradox. Additional necessary criteria for coherence may include universalism or absoluteness, suggesting that the theory remains anthropological or incoherent when it does not use the concept of infinity. A coherentist might argue that this scenario applies regardless of the theories being considered, and so, that coherentism must be the preferred truth-theoretical framework in avoiding relativism.\n\nIn modern philosophy, the coherence theory of truth was defended by Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Harold Henry Joachim (who is credited with the definitive formulation of the theory). (However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the correspondence theory of truth.) In contemporary philosophy, several epistemologists have significantly contributed to and defended the theory, primarily Brand Blanshard (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times) and Nicholas Rescher.\n\nIn late modern philosophy, epistemic coherentist views were held by Schlegel and Hegel, but the definitive formulation of the coherence theory of justification was provided by F. H. Bradley in his book \"The Principles of Logic\" (1883). In contemporary philosophy, several epistemologists have significantly contributed to epistemic coherentism, primarily A. C. Ewing (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times), Brand Blanshard, C. I. Lewis, Nicholas Rescher, Laurence BonJour, Keith Lehrer, and Paul Thagard. Otto Neurath is also sometimes thought to be an epistemic coherentist.\n\nBoth coherence and foundationalist theories of \"justification\" attempt to answer the regress argument, a fundamental problem in epistemology that goes as follows. Given some statement P, it appears reasonable to ask for a justification for P. If that justification takes the form of another statement, P', one can again reasonably ask for a justification for P', and so forth. There are three possible outcomes to this questioning process:\n\nAn infinite series appears to offer little help, unless a way is found to model infinite sets. This might entail additional assumptions. Otherwise, it is impossible to check that each justification is satisfactory without making broad generalizations.\n\nCoherentism is sometimes characterized as accepting that the series forms a loop, but although this would produce a form of coherentism, this is not what is generally meant by the term. Those who do accept the loop theory sometimes argue that the body of assumptions used to prove the theory is not what is at question in considering a loop of premises. This would serve the typical purpose of circumventing the reliance on a regression, but might be considered a form of logical foundationalism. But otherwise, it must be assumed that a loop begs the question, meaning that it does not provide sufficient logic to constitute proof.\n\nOne might conclude that there must be some statements that, for some reason, do not need justification. This view is called foundationalism. For instance, rationalists such as Descartes and Spinoza developed axiomatic systems that relied on statements that were taken to be self-evident: \"I think therefore I am\" is the most famous example. Similarly, empiricists take observations as providing the foundation for the series.\n\nFoundationalism relies on the claim that it is not necessary to ask for justification of certain propositions, or that they are self-justifying. Coherentists argue that this position is overly dogmatic. In other words, it does not provide real criteria for determining what is true and what is not. The Coherentist analytic project then involves a process of justifying what is meant by adequate criteria for non-dogmatic truth. As an offshoot of this, the theory insists that it is \"always\" reasonable to ask for a justification for \"any\" statement. For example, if someone makes an observational statement, such as \"it is raining\", the coherentist contends that it is reasonable to ask for example whether this mere statement refers to anything real. What is real about the statement, it turns out, is the extended pattern of relations that we call justifications. But, unlike the relativist, the coherentist argues that these associations may be objectively real. Coherentism contends that dogmatic foundationalism does not provide the whole set of pure relations that might result in actually understanding the objective context of phenomena, because dogmatic assumptions are not proof-theoretic, and therefore remain incoherent or relativistic. Coherentists therefore argue that the only way to reach proof-theoretic truth that is not relativistic is through coherency.\n\nCoherentism denies the soundness of the regression argument. The regression argument makes the assumption that the justification for a proposition takes the form of another proposition: P\" justifies P', which in turn justifies P. For coherentism, justification is a holistic process. Inferential justification for the belief that P is nonlinear. This means that P\" and P' are not epistemically prior to P. Rather, the beliefs that P\", P', and P work together to achieve epistemic justification. Catherine Elgin has expressed the same point differently, arguing that beliefs must be \"mutually consistent, cotenable, and supportive. That is, the components must be reasonable in light of one another. Since both cotenability and supportiveness are matters of degree, coherence is too.\" Usually the system of belief is taken to be the complete set of beliefs of the individual or group, that is, their theory of the world.\n\nIt is necessary for coherentism to explain in some detail what it means for a system to be coherent. At the least, coherence must include logical consistency. It also usually requires some degree of integration of the various components of the system. A system that contains more than one unrelated explanation of the same phenomenon is not as coherent as one that uses only one explanation, all other things being equal. Conversely, a theory that explains divergent phenomena using unrelated explanations is not as coherent as one that uses only one explanation for those divergent phenomena. These requirements are variations on Occam's razor. The same points can be made more formally using Bayesian statistics. Finally, the greater the number of phenomena explained by the system, the greater its coherence.\n\nA problem coherentism has to face is the \"plurality objection\". There is nothing within the definition of coherence that makes it impossible for two entirely different sets of beliefs to be internally coherent. Thus there might be several such sets. But if one supposes—in line with the principle of non-contradiction—that there can only be \"one\" complete set of truths, coherentism must therefore resolve internally that these systems are not contradictory, by establishing what is meant by truth. At this point, Coherence could be faulted for adopting its own variation of dogmatic foundationalism by arbitrarily selecting truth values. Coherentists must argue that their truth-values are not arbitrary for provable reasons.\n\nA second objection also emerges, the \"finite problem\": that arbitrary, ad hoc relativism could reduce statements of relatively insignificant value to non-entities during the process of establishing universalism or absoluteness. This might result in a totally flat truth-theoretic framework, or even arbitrary truth values. Coherentists generally solve this by adopting a metaphysical condition of universalism, sometimes leading to materialism, or by arguing that relativism is trivial.\n\nHowever, metaphysics poses another problem, the problem of the stowaway argument that might carry epistemological implications. However, a coherentist might say that if the truth conditions of the logic hold, then there will be no problem regardless of any additional conditions that happen to be true. Thus, the stress is on making the theory valid within the set, and also verifiable.\n\nA number of philosophers have raised concerns over the link between intuitive notions of coherence that form the foundation of epistemic forms of coherentism and some formal results in Bayesian probability. This is an issue raised by Luc Bovens and Stephen Hartmann in the form of 'impossibility' results, and by Erik J. Olsson. Attempts have been made to construct a theoretical account of the coherentist intuition.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Aquinas wrote the treatise in 1263 while he was papal theologian and conventual lector in the Dominican \"studium\" at Orvieto after his first regency as professor of theology at the University of Paris which ended in 1259 and before he took up his duties in 1265 reforming the Dominican \"studium\" at Santa Sabina, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\", in Rome.\n\nThe title of the treatise was not given by Aquinas himself, and it contains nothing that is directed against the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but only, in the view of theologian Yves Congar, a defence of Catholic doctrine against Eastern misunderstandings.\n\nThe 72 chapters of the work are each of the length of a paragraph in a modern book. In it Aquinas presents the teaching of the Greek Church Fathers as in harmony with that of the Latin Church. The book is arranged in two parts, the first of 32 chapters and the second of 40, each part preceded by a prologue, and the work as a whole concluded with an epilogue. All the first part and 31 of the 40 chapters of the second concern pneumatology (doctrine on the Holy Spirit). Of the final 9 chapters, 7 deal with the position of the Roman Pontiff, and the last two with the use of leavened bread in the Eucharist and with purgatory. In all of these Aquinas quoted expressions by Fathers of the Greek Church in support of the teaching propounded by the Latin Church.\n\nAquinas died on his way to participate in the 1274 Second Council of Lyons, to which he had been invited, but this treatise, which he had written eleven years before and not for the use of this Council, was influential at the Council.\n\nThe 1968 Leonine edition is available in Latin at the Corpus Thomisticum website.\n\nA complete English translation is given at the website of the Dominican Province of St Joseph.\n\nA different English translation, but only of the first ten chapters, is found at the website of Ecclesia Triumphans Catholic Apologetics.\n\nThe titles of the first ten chapters given in the latter translation indicate something of the contents of the short work:\n\nIn his treatise, Aquinas \"demonstrated that there was a theological harmony between the Greek Church Fathers and the Latin Church\". He pointed out that one source of misunderstandings between Greeks and Latins was the difficulty of finding appropriate words in each language` with which to translate technical theological terms used in the other:\n\nThe apologetic impact of the work is limited, due to the fact that Thomas uses a collection of texts compilled by Nicholas of Crotone which contains doubtful attributions and personal glosses of the compiller that bent the text in direction of the Latin theology. According to Jean-Pierre Torell, \"on four specific questions concerning the procession \"a filio\", the primacy of the pope, the Eucharistic celebration with unleavened bread, and purgatory, Thomas is clearly forced to rely more on the texts that are closer to Latin theology, when these are in fact glosses foreign to the Fathers.\"\n\n"}

Most students attend public schools through the lower secondary level, but private education is popular at the upper secondary and university levels.\n\nEducation prior to elementary school is provided at kindergartens and day-care centers. Public and private day-care centers take children from under age 1 on up to 5 years old. The programmes for those children aged 3–5 resemble those at kindergartens. The educational approach at kindergartens varies greatly from unstructured environments that emphasize play to highly structured environments that are focused on having the child pass the entrance exam at a private elementary school. The academic year starts from April and ends in March, having summer vacation in August and winter vacation in the end of December to the beginning of January. Also, there are few days of holidays between academic years. The period of academic year is the same all through elementary level to higher educations nationwide.\n\nJapanese students consistently rank highly among OECD students in terms of quality and performance in reading literacy, math, and sciences. The average student scored 540 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the country has one of the world's highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries. Its populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan’s post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering, benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan’s public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.\n\nJapan's education system played a central part in Japan's recovery and rapid economic growth in the decades following the end of World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university.\nAlthough Japan ranks highly on the PISA tests, its educational system has been criticized for its focus on standardized testing and conformity; bullying problems; and its strong academic pressure on students.\n\nFormal education in Japan began with the adoption of Chinese culture, in the 6th century. Buddhist and Confucian teachings as well as sciences, calligraphy, divination and literature were taught at the courts of Asuka, Nara and Heian. Scholar officials were chosen through an Imperial examination system. But contrary to China, the system never fully took hold and titles and posts at the court remained hereditary family possessions. The rise of the \"bushi\", the military class, during the Kamakura period ended the influence of scholar officials, but Buddhist monasteries remained influential centers of learning.\n\nIn the Edo period, the Yushima Seidō in Edo was the chief educational institution of the state; and at its head was the \"Daigaku-no-kami\", a title which identified the leader of the Tokugawa training school for shogunate bureaucrats.\n\nUnder the Tokugawa shogunate, the daimyō vied for power in the largely pacified country. Since their influence could not be raised through war, they competed on the economic field. Their warrior-turned-bureaucrat Samurai elite had to be educated not only in military strategy and the martial arts, but also agriculture and accounting. Likewise, the wealthy merchant class needed education for their daily business, and their wealth allowed them to be patrons of arts and science. But temple schools (terakoya) educated peasants too, and it is estimated that at the end of the Edo period 50% of the male and 20% of the female population possessed some degree of literacy. Even though contact with foreign countries was restricted, books from China and Europe were eagerly imported and Rangaku (\"Dutch studies\") became a popular area of scholarly interest.\n\nThere were facilities that were created to specifically educate samurai and their children to perpetuate morality and mindfulness of their class. These schools, hanko schools, were where scholars would bring together samurai to listen to lectures on Confucianism, military arts, and other subjects. Samurai would then attempt to teach villagers what they had learned, “proper guidance to the common people’s spirit and manners,” by posting flyers and creating handbooks . Some Shogun and Daimyo were also interested in spreading education throughout their protected land with the target audience as adult commoners and children. Elementary education was imparted as well as writing and morality lessons. The Shirakawa Village School’s town bulletin explains the point of education for the commoners, “If not only the important people of the village but also the lesser people have continuous teaching from the appointed village schools, they will gain understanding” . ‘Commoners’ would also form many communal gatherings to attempt and Englishmen themselves with the help of a scholar. To name one, Baigan Ishida, who was a great orator and writer that reached the outcropping of the merchant class. There were wakashu-gumi, or youth groups, that consisted of young men ages fourteen to seventeen, who at these groups learned about ceremonies, cooperative living, language, manners, marriage, straw weaving, and world information, not to mention talking and singing. Japan was thriving with the want for enlightenment. One may say the need for more education is one of the reasons why the Tokugawa Shogunate failed in 1868. \n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the methods and structures of Western learning were adopted as a means to make Japan a strong, modern nation. Students and even high-ranking government officials were sent abroad to study, such as the Iwakura mission. Foreign scholars, the so-called \"o-yatoi gaikokujin\", were invited to teach at newly founded universities and military academies. Compulsory education was introduced, mainly after the Prussian model. In order to aid in the modernization the country, the Meiji government built a public library in 1872 modeled after Western architecture. The Japan Library Association (or the JLA) was founded in 1892 to promote the library. However, public education became the main focus of the Meiji government before they could strengthen the library’s presence in 1899. By 1890, only 20 years after the resumption of full international relations, Japan discontinued employment of the foreign consultants.\n\nA modern concept of childhood emerged in Japan after 1850 as part of its engagement with the West. Meiji period leaders decided the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals - and children - in service of the state. The Western-style school was introduced as the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood. After 1890 Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who bought into the new sensibility. They taught the upper middle class a model of childhood that included children having their own space where they read children's books, played with educational toys and, especially, devoted enormous time to school homework. These ideas rapidly disseminated through all social classes.\n\nAfter the defeat in World War II, the Allied occupation government set education reform as one of its primary goals, to eradicate militarist teachings and convert Japan into a pacifist democracy. Nine years of education was made mandatory, with six years in elementary education and three in junior high as an emulation of the American educational system. A number of reforms were carried out in the post-war period that aimed at easing the burden of entrance examinations, promoting internationalization and information technologies, diversifying education and supporting lifelong learning.\n\nIn an effort to ease Japanese postwar sentiments, any nationalistic, militaristic, authoritarian, or anti-American content was blackened from learning materials. This practice was known as \"suminuru\", and was used as the primary method of educational reform until newly fashioned texts, Kuni no ayumi (Footsteps of the Nation), Nihon rekishi (Japanese History), and Minshushugi (Democracy) were written by the Ministry of Education and Civil Information and Education Section. The Ministry of Education is now known as the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and is responsible for educational administration.\n\nIn successive international assessment tests, Japan's fourth- and eighth-grade students have consistently ranked in the top five globally in both mathematics and science (see TIMSS).\n\nDespite concerns that academic skills for Japanese students may have declined since the mid-1990s, Japan's students showed a significant improvement in math and science scores in the 2011 TIMSS survey, compared to the 2007 scores.\n\nThe school year in Japan begins in April and classes are held from Monday to either Friday or Saturday, depending on the school. The school year consists of two or three terms, which are separated by short holidays in spring and winter, and a six-week-long summer break.\n\nThe year structure is summarized below:\n\nLower secondary school covers grades seven through nine, with children typically aged twelve through fifteen. There are 3.5 million primary school students in Japan as of 2012, down from over 5.3 million in 1990. However, the number of junior high schools has remained relatively static, falling from 11,275 in 1990 to 10,699 in 2012. The number of junior high school teachers has also changed little, with 257,605 junior high school teachers in 1990, and 253,753 in 2012). Approximately 8% of junior high students attend a private junior high school (accounting for 7% of all junior high schools). Private schools are considerably more expensive: as of 2012, the average annual cost of private primary school attendance was ¥1,295,156 per student, roughly thrice the ¥450,340 cost for a public school. Japan's compulsory education ends at grade nine, but less than 2% drop out; 60% of students advanced to senior education as of 1960, increasing rapidly to over 90% by 1980, rising further each year until reaching 98.3% as of 2012.\n\nTeachers often major in their respective subjects, and more than 80% graduate from a four-year college. Classes are large, with an average of thirty-eight students per class, and each class is assigned a homeroom teacher, doubling as a counselor. Unlike kindergarten students, primary school students have different teachers for different subjects. However, the teacher changes rooms for each period, rather than the students.\n\nInstruction in primary schools is often in the form of lectures. Teachers also use other media, such as television and radio, and there is some laboratory work. By 1989 about 45% of all public primary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. All course contents are specified in the Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools. Some subjects, such as Japanese language and mathematics, are coordinated with the elementary curriculum. Others, such as foreign-language study, begin at this level, though from April 2011, English became a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum. The junior school curriculum covers Japanese language, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, health, and physical education. All students are also exposed to industrial arts and homemaking. Moral education and special activities continue to receive attention. Most students also participate in one of a range of school clubs that occupy them until around 6 p.m. most weekdays (including weekends and often before school as well), as part of an effort to address juvenile delinquency.\n\nA growing number of primary school students also attend \"juku\", private extracurricular study schools, in the evenings and on weekends. A focus by students upon these other studies and the increasingly structured demands upon students' time have been criticized by teachers and in the media for contributing to a decline in classroom standards and student performance in recent years.\n\nThe ministry recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all foreign languages, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken English, the government invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school boards and prefectures under its Japan Exchange and Teaching Program (JET). Beginning with 848 participants in 1987, the program grew to a high of 6,273 participants in 2002. The program was in a decline in recent years due to several factors, including shrinking local school budgets funding the program, as well as an increasing number of school boards hiring their foreign native speakers directly or through lower-paying, private agencies. Today, the program is again growing due to English becoming a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum in 2011.\n\nThough upper-secondary school is not compulsory in Japan, 94% of all junior high school graduates enrolled as of 2005. Private upper-secondary schools account for about 55% of all upper-secondary schools, and neither public nor private schools are free. The Ministry of Education estimated that annual family expenses for the education of a child in a public upper-secondary school were about ¥300,000 in the 1980s and that private upper-secondary schools were about twice as expensive.\n\nThe most common type of upper-secondary school has a full-time, general program that offered academic courses for students preparing for higher education as well as technical and vocational courses for students expecting to find employment after graduation. More than 70% of upper-secondary school students were enrolled in the general academic program in the late 1980s. A small number of schools offer part-time programs, evening courses, or correspondence education.\n\nThe first-year programs for students in both academic and commercial courses are similar. They include basic academic courses, such as Japanese language, English, mathematics, and science. In upper-secondary school, differences in ability are first publicly acknowledged, and course content and course selection are far more individualized in the second year. However, there is a core of academic material throughout all programs.\n\nVocational-technical programs includes several hundred specialized courses, such as information processing, navigation, fish farming, business, English, and ceramics. Business and industrial courses are the most popular, accounting for 72% of all students in full-time vocational programs in 1989.\n\nMost upper-secondary teachers are university graduates. Upper-secondary schools are organized into departments, and teachers specialize in their major fields although they teach a variety of courses within their disciplines. Teaching depends largely on the lecture system, with the main goal of covering the very demanding curriculum in the time allotted. Approach and subject coverage tends to be uniform, at least in the public schools.\n\nTraining of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more students with disabilities.\n\nHigher education in Japan is provided at universities (daigaku), junior colleges (tanki daigaku), colleges of technology (koto senmon gakko) and special training schools and community colleges (senshu gakko). Of these four types of institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered postsecondary education providers.\n\nAs of 2010, more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in 778 universities. At the top of the higher education structure, these institutions provide a four-year training leading to a bachelor's degree, and some offer six-year programs leading to a professional degree. There are two types of public four-year colleges: the 86 national universities (including the Open University of Japan) and the 95 local public universities, founded by prefectures and municipalities. The 597 remaining four-year colleges in 2010 were private. With a wealth of opportunities for students wishing to pursue tertiary education, the nation’s prestigious schools are the most appealing for students seeking to gain top employment prospects.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of college students attend full-time day programs. In 1990 the most popular courses, enrolling almost 40 percent of all undergraduate students, were in the social sciences, including business, law, and accounting. Other popular subjects were engineering (19 percent), the humanities (15 percent), and education (7 percent).\n\nThe average costs (tuition, fees, and living expenses) for a year of higher education in 1986 were ¥1.4 million. To help defray expenses, students frequently work part-time or borrow money through the government-supported Japan Scholarship Association. Assistance is also offered by local governments, nonprofit corporations, and other institutions.\n\nAccording to the \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" and École des Mines de Paris, the top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.\n\nThe QS Asia University Rankings Top 40 included the University of Tokyo at 13th position,Tokyo Institute of Technology at 14th, Osaka University at 15th, Kyoto University at 17th, Tohoku University at 20th, Nagoya University at 27th, Kyushu University at 29th, Keio University at 36th, Waseda University at 39th, and the University of Tsukuba at 40th.\n\nBased on the 2011 Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings, there are 33 Japanese universities in the top 100 Asian university rankings.\n\nThe Japanese educational system is supplemented by a heavy emphasis on extracurricular activities, also known as shadow education, which are any educational activities that don't take place during formal schooling. This is largely motivated by the extreme weight that is placed upon formal examinations as a prerequisite to attend university, something that is seen as integral to their future career and social status. In order to gain a competitive edge, Japanese families are willing to expend money and have their child put in time and effort into a supplementary education. Forms of shadow education include \"mogi shiken\", which are practice exams given by private companies that determine the child's chances of getting into a university. \"Juku\" are private after school classes that aim to develop abilities for students to excel in formal school curriculum or to prepare for university examinations. \"Ronin\" are students that undergo full-time preparation for university exams following high school due to their inability to get into their school of choice.\n\nOver 86% of students with college plans participate in at least one form of shadow education, with 60% participating in two or more.\n\nJapanese students are faced with immense pressure to succeed academically from their parents, teachers, peers and society. This is largely a result of a society that has long placed a great amount of importance on education, and a system that places all of its weight upon a single examination that has significant life-long consequences. This pressure has led to behaviors such as school violence, cheating, suicide, and significant psychological harm. In some cases, students have experienced nervous breakdowns that have required hospitalization as young as twelve. In 1991, it was reported that 1,333 people in the age group of 15-24 had committed suicide, much of which was due to academic pressure. A survey by the Education Ministry showed that students at public schools were involved in a record number of violent incidents in 2007: 52,756 cases, an increase of some 8,000 on the previous year. In almost 7,000 of these incidents, teachers were the target of assault.\n\nThe Japanese educational system has also been criticized for failure to foster independent thinkers with cultural and artistic sensibility. Japanese students that attend schools overseas often face difficulty adapting and competing in that environment due to lack of international viewpoints.\n\nAs of 2016, Japan has 30-40 international schools. There are many Kindergarten type schools that use the word \"international\" in their names but this is not an indicator that they are Japanese schools in the traditional sense. These types of kindergartens are usually immersion programs for Japanese students and the schools hire mostly foreigners to act as the main class \"teacher\" or as an assistant to the Japanese teacher. United Nations University is located in Japan and Temple University has a branch campus in Japan. International University of Japan is an internationally top-ranked, fully English-taught University in Japan. Akita International University is also an English-taught University. Sophia University's Faculty of Liberal Arts is fully taught in English. Tokyo University of Foreign Studies is a highly selective, specialist institution for International Studies and offers some languages that are rarely taught elsewhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "251323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251323", "title": "Emotivism", "text": "Emotivism\n\nEmotivism is a meta-ethical view that claims that ethical sentences do not express propositions but emotional attitudes. Hence, it is colloquially known as the hurrah/boo theory. Influenced by the growth of analytic philosophy and logical positivism in the 20th century, the theory was stated vividly by A. J. Ayer in his 1936 book \"Language, Truth and Logic\", but its development owes more to C. L. Stevenson.\n\nEmotivism can be considered a form of non-cognitivism or expressivism. It stands in opposition to other forms of non-cognitivism (such as quasi-realism and universal prescriptivism), as well as to all forms of cognitivism (including both moral realism and ethical subjectivism).\n\nIn the 1950s, emotivism appeared in a modified form in the universal prescriptivism of R. M. Hare.\n\nEmotivism reached prominence in the early 20th century, but it was born centuries earlier. In 1710, George Berkeley wrote that language in general often serves to inspire feelings as well as communicate ideas. Decades later, David Hume espoused ideas similar to Stevenson's later ones. In his 1751 book \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\", Hume considered morality to be related to fact but \"determined by sentiment\":\n\nG. E. Moore published his \"Principia Ethica\" in 1903 and argued that the attempts of ethical naturalists to translate ethical terms (like \"good\" and \"bad\") into non-ethical ones (like \"pleasing\" and \"displeasing\") committed the \"naturalistic fallacy\". Moore was a cognitivist, but his case against ethical naturalism steered other philosophers toward noncognitivism, particularly emotivism.\n\nThe emergence of logical positivism and its verifiability criterion of meaning early in the 20th century led some philosophers to conclude that ethical statements, being incapable of empirical verification, were cognitively meaningless. This criterion was fundamental to A.J. Ayer's defense of positivism in \"Language, Truth and Logic\", which contains his statement of emotivism. However, positivism is not essential to emotivism itself, perhaps not even in Ayer's form, and some positivists in the Vienna Circle, which had great influence on Ayer, held non-emotivist views.\n\nR. M. Hare unfolded his ethical theory of universal prescriptivism in 1952's \"The Language of Morals\", intending to defend the importance of rational moral argumentation against the \"propaganda\" he saw encouraged by Stevenson, who thought moral argumentation was sometimes psychological and not rational. But Hare's disagreement was not universal, and the similarities between his noncognitive theory and the emotive one — especially his claim, and Stevenson's, that moral judgments contain commands and are thus not purely descriptive — caused some to regard him as an emotivist, a classification he denied:\n\nInfluential statements of emotivism were made by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards in their 1923 book on language, \"The Meaning of Meaning\", and by W. H. F. Barnes and A. Duncan-Jones in independent works on ethics in 1934. However, it is the later works of Ayer and especially Stevenson that are the most developed and discussed defenses of the theory.\n\nA. J. Ayer's version of emotivism is given in chapter six, \"Critique of Ethics and Theology\", of \"Language, Truth and Logic\". In that chapter, Ayer divides \"the ordinary system of ethics\" into four classes:\nHe focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy. While class three statements were irrelevant to Ayer's brand of emotivism, they would later play a significant role in Stevenson's.\n\nAyer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition as \"worthless\" for determining moral truths, since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are \"mere pseudo-concepts\":\n\nAyer agrees with subjectivists in saying that ethical statements are necessarily \"related\" to individual attitudes, but he says they lack truth value because they cannot be properly understood as \"propositions\" about those attitudes; Ayer thinks ethical sentences are \"expressions\", not \"assertions\", of approval. While an assertion of approval may always be accompanied by an expression of approval, expressions can be made without making assertions; Ayer's example is boredom, which can be expressed through the stated assertion \"I am bored\" or through non-assertions including tone of voice, body language, and various other verbal statements. He sees ethical statements as expressions of the latter sort, so the phrase \"Theft is wrong\" is a non-propositional sentence that is an expression of disapproval but is not equivalent to the proposition \"I disapprove of theft\".\n\nHaving argued that his theory of ethics is noncognitive and not subjective, he accepts that his position and subjectivism are equally confronted by G. E. Moore's argument that ethical disputes are clearly genuine disputes and not just expressions of contrary feelings. Ayer's defense is that all ethical disputes are about \"facts\" regarding the proper application of a value system to a specific case, not about the value systems themselves, because any dispute about values can only be resolved by judging that one value system is superior to another, and this judgment itself presupposes a shared value system. If Moore is wrong in saying that there are actual disagreements of \"value\", we are left with the claim that there are actual disagreements of \"fact\", and Ayer accepts this without hesitation:\n\nStevenson's work has been seen both as an elaboration upon Ayer's views and as a representation of one of \"two broad types of ethical emotivism.\" An analytic philosopher, Stevenson suggested in his 1937 essay \"The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms\" that any ethical theory should explain three things: that intelligent disagreement can occur over moral questions, that moral terms like \"good\" are \"magnetic\" in encouraging action, and that the scientific method is insufficient for verifying moral claims. Stevenson's own theory was fully developed in his 1944 book \"Ethics and Language\". In it, he agrees with Ayer that ethical sentences express the speaker's feelings, but he adds that they also have an \"imperative\" component intended to change the listener's feelings and that this component is of greater importance. Where Ayer spoke of \"values\", or fundamental psychological inclinations, Stevenson speaks of \"attitudes\", and where Ayer spoke of disagreement of \"fact\", or rational disputes over the application of certain values to a particular case, Stevenson speaks of differences in \"belief\"; the concepts are the same. Terminology aside, Stevenson interprets ethical statements according to two patterns of analysis.\n\nUnder his first pattern of analysis, an ethical statement has two parts: a declaration of the speaker's attitude and an imperative to mirror it, so \"'This is good' means \"I approve of this; do so as well.\"\" The first half of the sentence is a proposition, but the imperative half is not, so Stevenson's translation of an ethical sentence remains a noncognitive one.\n\nImperatives cannot be \"proved\", but they can still be \"supported\" so that the listener understands that they are not wholly arbitrary:\n\nThe purpose of these supports is to make the listener understand the consequences of the action they are being commanded to do. Once they understand the command's consequences, they can determine whether or not obedience to the command will have desirable results.\n\nStevenson's second pattern of analysis is used for statements about \"types\" of actions, not specific actions. Under this pattern,\n\nIn second-pattern analysis, rather than judge an action directly, the speaker is evaluating it according to a general principle. For instance, someone who says \"Murder is wrong\" might mean \"Murder decreases happiness overall\"; this is a second-pattern statement that leads to a first-pattern one: \"I disapprove of anything that decreases happiness overall. Do so as well.\"\n\nFor Stevenson, moral disagreements may arise from different fundamental attitudes, different moral beliefs about specific cases, or both. The methods of moral argumentation he proposed have been divided into three groups, known as \"logical\", \"rational psychological\" and \"nonrational psychological\" forms of argumentation.\n\nLogical methods involve efforts to show inconsistencies between a person's fundamental attitudes and their particular moral beliefs. For example, someone who says \"Edward is a good person\" who has previously said \"Edward is a thief\" and \"No thieves are good people\" is guilty of inconsistency until he retracts one of his statements. Similarly, a person who says \"Lying is always wrong\" might consider lies in some situations to be morally permissible, and if examples of these situations can be given, his view can be shown to be logically inconsistent.\n\nRational psychological methods examine facts that relate fundamental attitudes to particular moral beliefs; the goal is not to show that someone has been inconsistent, as with logical methods, but only that they are wrong about the facts that connect their attitudes to their beliefs. To modify the former example, consider the person who holds that all thieves are bad people. If she sees Edward pocket a wallet found in a public place, she may conclude that he is a thief, and there would be no inconsistency between her attitude (that thieves are bad people) and her belief (that Edward is a bad person because he is a thief). However, it may be that Edward recognized the wallet as belonging to a friend, to whom he promptly returned it. Such a revelation would likely change the observer's belief about Edward, and even if it did not, the attempt to reveal such facts would count as a rational psychological form of moral argumentation.\n\nNon-rational psychological methods revolve around language with psychological influence but no necessarily logical connection to the listener's attitudes. Stevenson called the primary such method \"'persuasive,' in a somewhat broadened sense\", and wrote:\n\nPersuasion may involve the use of particular emotion-laden words, like \"democracy\" or \"dictator\", or hypothetical questions like \"What if everyone thought the way you do?\" or \"How would you feel if you were in their shoes?\"\n\nUtilitarian philosopher Richard Brandt offered several criticisms of emotivism in his 1959 book \"Ethical Theory\". His first is that \"ethical utterances are not obviously the kind of thing the emotive theory says they are, and prima facie, at least, should be viewed as statements.\" He thinks that emotivism cannot explain why most people, historically speaking, have considered ethical sentences to be \"fact-stating\" and not just emotive. Furthermore, he argues that people who change their moral views see their prior views as mistaken, not just different, and that this does not make sense if their attitudes were all that changed:\n\nJames Urmson's 1968 book \"The Emotive Theory of Ethics\" also disagreed with many of Stevenson's points in \"Ethics and Language\", \"a work of great value\" with \"a few serious mistakes [that] led Stevenson consistently to distort his otherwise valuable insights\".\n\nBrandt criticized what he termed \"the 'magnetic influence' thesis\", the idea of Stevenson that ethical statements are meant to influence the listener's attitudes. Brandt contends that most ethical statements, including judgments of people who are not within listening range, are \"not\" made with the intention to alter the attitudes of others. Twenty years earlier, Sir William David Ross offered much the same criticism in his book \"Foundations of Ethics\". Ross suggests that the emotivist theory seems to be coherent only when dealing with simple linguistic acts, such as recommending, commanding, or passing judgement on something happening at the same point of time as the utterance.\n\nAccording to this view, it would make little sense to translate a statement such as \"Galileo should not have been forced to recant on heliocentricism\" into a command, imperative, or recommendation - to do so might require a radical change in the meaning of these ethical statements. Under this criticism, it would appear as if emotivist and prescriptivist theories are only capable of converting a relatively small subset of all ethical claims into imperatives.\n\nLike Ross and Brandt, Urmson disagrees with Stevenson's \"causal theory\" of emotive meaning—the theory that moral statements only have \"emotive\" meaning when they are made to change in a listener's attitude—saying that is incorrect in explaining \"evaluative force in purely causal terms\". This is Urmson's fundamental criticism, and he suggests that Stevenson would have made a stronger case by explaining emotive meaning in terms of \"commending and recommending attitudes\", not in terms of \"the power to evoke attitudes\".\n\nStevenson's \"Ethics and Language\", written after Ross's book but before Brandt's and Urmson's, states that emotive terms are \"not always used for purposes of exhortation.\" For example, in the sentence \"Slavery was good in Ancient Rome\", Stevenson thinks one is speaking of past attitudes in an \"almost purely descriptive\" sense. And in some discussions of \"current\" attitudes, \"agreement in attitude can be taken for granted,\" so a judgment like \"He was wrong to kill them\" might describe one's attitudes yet be \"emotively inactive\", with no real emotive (or imperative) meaning. Stevenson is doubtful that sentences in such contexts qualify as \"normative\" ethical sentences, maintaining that \"for the contexts that are most typical of normative ethics, the ethical terms have a function that is \"both\" emotive and descriptive.\"\n\nPhilippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a \"committal in a new dimension.\" She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word \"injury\". Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?\n\nFoot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.\nAs an offshoot of his fundamental criticism of Stevenson's magnetic influence thesis, Urmson wrote that ethical statements had two functions — \"standard using\", the application of accepted values to a particular case, and \"standard setting\", the act of proposing certain values as those that \"should\" be accepted — and that Stevenson confused them. According to Urmson, Stevenson's \"I approve of this; do so as well\" is a standard-setting statement, yet most moral statements are actually standard-\"using\" ones, so Stevenson's explanation of ethical sentences is unsatisfactory. Colin Wilks has responded that Stevenson's distinction between first-order and second-order statements resolves this problem: a person who says \"Sharing is good\" may be making a second-order statement like \"Sharing is approved of by the community\", the sort of standard-using statement Urmson says is most typical of moral discourse. At the same time, their statement can be reduced to a first-order, standard-setting sentence: \"I approve of whatever is approved of by the community; do so as well.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The complexity arises out of the situational conflict in which obeying one would result in transgressing another. \nSometimes called ethical paradoxes in moral philosophy, ethical dilemmas may be invoked to refute an ethical system or moral code, or to improve it so as to resolve the paradox.\n\nAn ethical dilemma is a decision making problem between two possible moral imperatives, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. It is sometimes called an ethical paradox in moral philosophy.\n\n\n\n\nEthical dilemmas can be solved in various ways, for example by showing that the claimed situation is only apparent and does not really exist (thus is not a paradox logically), or that the solution to the ethical dilemma involves choosing the greater good and lesser evil (as discussed in value theory), or that the whole framing of the problem omits creative alternatives (such as peacemaking), or (more recently) that situational ethics or situated ethics must apply because the case cannot be removed from context and still be understood. \"See also case-based reasoning on this process.\" An alternative to situational ethics is graded absolutism.\n\nA popular ethical conflict is that between an imperative or injunction not to steal and one to care for a family that you cannot afford to feed without stolen money. Debates on this often revolve around the availability of alternate means of income or support such as a social safety net, charity, etc. The debate is in its starkest form when framed as stealing food. Under an ethical system in which stealing is always wrong and letting one's family die from starvation is always wrong, a person in such a situation would be forced to commit one wrong to avoid committing another, and be in constant conflict with those whose view of the acts varied.\n\nHowever, there are no legitimate ethical systems in which stealing is more wrong than letting one's family die. Ethical systems do in fact allow for, and sometimes outline, tradeoffs or priorities in decisions. Resolving ethical dilemmas is rarely simple or clearcut and very often involves revisiting similar dilemmas that recur within societies.\n\nAccording to some philosophers and sociologists, e.g. Karl Marx and marxist ethics, it is the different life experience of people and the different exposure of them and their families in these roles (the rich constantly robbing the poor, the poor in a position of constant begging and subordination) that creates social class differences. In other words, ethical dilemmas can become political and economic factions that engage in long-term recurring struggles.\n\n"}

It shows that how the knowledge was gained affects how valid it is. For example, our experience of gravity makes our knowledge of it more valid than our theory about black holes. Genetic epistemology also explains the process of how people develop cognitively from birth throughout their lives in four primary stages: sensorimotor (birth to age 2), pre-operational (2-7), concrete operational (7-11), and formal operational (11 years onward). The main focus is on the younger years of development. \"Assimilation\" occurs when the perception of a new event or object occurs to the learner in an existing schema and is usually used in the context of self-motivation. In \"Accommodation\", one accommodates the experiences according to the outcome of the tasks. The highest form of development is \"equilibration\". Equilibration encompasses both assimilation and accommodation as the learner changes how they think to get a better answer. This is the upper level of development.\n\nPiaget believed that knowledge is a biological function that results from the actions of an individual through change. He also stated that knowledge consists of structures, and comes about by the adaptation of these structures with the environment.\n\nPiaget's genetic epistemology is halfway between formal logic and dialectical logic. Piaget's epistemology is midway between objective idealism and materialism.\n\n\nPiaget draws on the full range of contemporary mathematical knowledge, a vast empirical base of observation of the learning of very young children built up at his institute and reports of observations of older children and a general knowledge of the development of knowledge in history.\n\n(1) From the standpoint of dialectical logic, we must agree that at each stage of development, at each \"definition of the Absolute\" in Hegel's terminology, formal logic is applicable. Piaget's proof of this is striking, and his demonstration of how the stages of development in child thought pass through a specific series which is deductive in a specific sense from the standpoint of mathematics is original and profound.\n\nHowever, from the standpoint of understanding development (and this is Piaget's standpoint), what is important is not the definition of each stage but the transition from one to the next; and for this it is necessary to demonstrate the internal contradiction within the logic of that plane.\n\nSince Piaget draws on mathematical logic more developed than what was known to Hegel, it will be necessary to investigate these structures to see if this speculative proposition proves to be valid.\n\n(2) The concept of interiorisation is indeed the basis of the materialist view of the development of thought. However, Piaget, as a professional child-psychologist falls prey to the objective idealism of any professional, of elevating the subject matter of his particular profession from being an aspect of the material world to being its master. [The charge of objective idealism is qualified, for Piaget is quite unambiguous that relations conceived of in thought exist objectively in the material world].\n\nThus, since his body of authoritative empirical work is in relation to early childhood development, he imposes the schema appropriate to this semi-human subject on to adolescent development, speculates on its possible reflection in anthropological development and confounds it with the history of development of science and philosophy. I say \"confounds\" because Piaget is aware that his schemas do not seem to apply in this domain. In this sense, the charge of objective idealism would seem unfair, but from confounding he does not go further and seek the implication of this lack of correspondence, but seeks to minimize it.\n\nBy focusing on early childhood (as indeed he must; that is his profession, and his institute has contributed a vast body of empirical material), Piaget sees what is biologically (zoologically?) human but not what is socially (historically) human, and humanity is essentially social, after all.\n\n(3) On the plus side, it has to be said that Piaget deals once and for all with any idea of innate intelligence, and makes fully convincing the prospect of a fully genetic (i.e. developmental) elaboration of intelligence, assuming only animal instincts such as grasping and sucking and sensorimotor \"equipment\" capable of reflecting highly developed relations.\nA weakness in Piaget's theory could be that there isn't proof in how one transitions from one stage to the next. Can someone progress from one stage forward, but revert backwards, and then move forward again?\n\nPiaget proposes three types of knowledge: physical, logical mathematical, and social knowledge.\n\nPhysical knowledge: It refers to knowledge related to objects in the world, which can be acquired through perceptual properties. The acquisition of physical knowledge has been equated with learning in Piaget's theory (Gruber and Voneche, 1995). In other words, thought is fit directly to experience.\n\"Piaget also called his view constructivism, because he firmly believed that knowledge acquisition is a process of continuous self-construction.

He is a Professor Emeritus of Economics at University College London (UCL) and a Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Bristol.\n\nHe is one of the founders of the modern economic theory of bargaining (along with Nash and Rubinstein), and has made important contributions to the foundations of game theory, experimental economics, and evolutionary game theory, as well as to analytical philosophy. Binmore took up economics after a career in mathematics, during which he held the Chair of Mathematics at the London School of Economics. Since his switch to economics he has been at the forefront of developments in game theory. His other research interests include political and moral philosophy, decision theory, and statistics. He is the author of more than 100 scholarly papers and 14 books.\n\nHe studied mathematics at Imperial College London where he was awarded 1st class honours BSc with Governor's Prize, and subsequently PhD (in mathematical analysis).\n\nBinmore's major research contributions are to the theory of bargaining and its testing in the laboratory. He is a pioneer of experimental economics. He began his experimental work in the 1980s when most economists thought that game theory would not work in the laboratory. Binmore and his collaborators established that game theory can often predict the behaviour of experienced players very well in laboratory settings, even in the case of human bargaining behaviour, a particularly challenging case for game theory. This has brought him into conflict with some proponents of behavioural economics who emphasise the importance of other-regarding or social preferences, and argue that their findings threaten traditional game theory.\n\nBinmore's work in political and moral philosophy began in the 1980s when he first applied bargaining theory to John Rawls' original position. His search for the philosophical foundations of the original position took him first to Kant's works, and then to Hume. Hume inspired Binmore to contribute to a naturalistic science of morals that seeks foundations for Rawlsian ideas about fairness norms in biological and social evolution. The result was his two-volume \"Game Theory and the Social Contract\", an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for a genuine science of morals using the theory of games. In \"Game Theory and the Social Contract\" Binmore proposes a naturalistic reinterpretation of John Rawls' original position that reconciles his egalitarian theory of justice with John Harsanyi's utilitarian theory. His recent \"Natural Justice\" provides a nontechnical synthesis of this work.\n\nIn 1995 Binmore became one of the founding directors of the Centre for Economic Learning and Social Evolution (ELSE), an interdisciplinary research centre involving economists, psychologists, anthropologists and mathematicians based at University College London. Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, ELSE pursues fundamental research on evolutionary and learning approaches to games and society, and it applies its theoretical findings to practical problems in government and business.\n\nWhile the Director of ELSE, Binmore became widely known as the ‘poker-playing economic theorist’ who netted the British government £22 billion when he led the team that designed the third generation (3G) telecommunications auction in 2000. He went on to design and implement 3G spectrum auctions in Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Israel and Hong Kong.\n\nBinmore is Emeritus Professor of Economics at University College London, Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Bristol and Visiting Professor in the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics. He has held corresponding positions at the London School of Economics, Caltech, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan. He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society and the British Academy. He was appointed a CBE in the New Year's Honours List 2001 for contributions to game theory and for his role in designing the UK's 3G telecommunications auctions. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. In 2007 he was appointed an Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bristol and an Honorary Fellow of the Centre for Philosophy at the London School of Economics.\n\n\n\n'The Origin of Fairness' in Alex Voorhoeve \"Conversations on Ethics.\" Oxford University Press, 2009.

{"id": "52713144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52713144", "title": "Liber physiognomiae", "text": "Liber physiognomiae\n\nLiber physiognomiae (; The Book of Physiognomy) is a work by the Scottish mathematician, philosopher, and scholar Michael Scot concerning physiognomy; the work is also the final book of a trilogy known as the \"Liber introductorius\". The \"Liber physiognomiae\" itself is divided into three sections, which deal with various concepts like procreation, generation, dream interpretation, and physiognomy proper.\n\nThe information found in the \"Liber physiognomiae\" seems to have been derived largely from Arabic copies of Aristotelian and Pseudo-Aristotelian works. The work was written in the early 13th century for Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor, but was first officially printed in 1477. \"Liber physiognomiae\" would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on physiognomy itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.\n\n\"Liber physiognomiae\" was written by the Scottish mathematician Michael Scot (AD 1175 – c. 1232) and is the final entry in a divination-centered trilogy, collectively titled the \"Liber introductorius\" (\"The Great Introductory Book\"). This trilogy also includes the \"Liber quatuor distinctionum\" (\"The Book of the Four Distinctions\") and the \"Liber particularis\" (\"The Singular Book\").\n\n\"Liber physiognomiae\", as the title suggests, concerns physiognomy, or a technique by which a person's character or personality is deduced based on their outer appearance. Scot refers to this as a \"doctrine of salvation\" (\"Phisionomia est doctrina salutis\"), as it easily allows one to determine if a person is virtuous or evil. The book is relatively short, comprising about sixty octavo pages. The work is usually divided into around one hundred chapters, with the number of chapters and their divisions differing greatly depending on what manuscript is being consulted.\n\nWhile the chapter headings vary across manuscripts, scholars are in agreement that the work is made up of three distinct sections. The first of these deals with the concepts of procreation and generation, largely according to the doctrines of Aristotle and Galen. This section opens by stressing the important influence of the stars before it deals with topics concerning human sexual intercourse. The book then moves onto the topics of conception and birth, and the author then explores the physical signs of pregnancy. The final two chapters of this section deal with animals; the penultimate chapter focuses on \"animals \"in genere et in specie\"\" (i.e. in regards to genus and species), while the final details an idiosyncratic system for differentiating the various types of animals.\n\nThe second section begins to focus specifically on physiognomy, considering different organs and body regions that index the \"character and faculties\" of individuals. Early chapters in this portion of the book are written in a medical style, and they detail signs in regards to \"temperate and healthy bod[ies] ... repletion of bad humours and excess of blood, cholera, phlegm, and melancholy\", before turning to particular sections of the body. Several following chapters discuss dreams and their meanings. Scot argues that dreams are: true or false; represent past, present, or future events; or are entirely meaningless. The second section comes to an end with chapters concerning auguries and sneezes, respectively.\n\nThe third and final section covers body parts, and explicates what the characteristics of these portions may reveal about the nature of the person in question. The final chapter in this section warns the would-be physiognomist to withhold judgement based solely on one part of their body, but rather to \"tend always to a general judgement based on the majority of all [the person's] members.\" This is because another part which has not been consulted may readily counter a conclusion suggested by a part that has. Scot also argues that a physiognomist should take into account a person's \"age, long residence in one place, long social usage, excessive prevalence of the humours of his complexion beyond what is customary, accidental sickness, violence, accidents contrary to nature, and a defect of one of the five natural senses.\"\n\nAccording to the physiognomy scholar Martin Porter, the \"Liber physiognomiae\" is a \"distinctly Aristotelian\" compendium of \"the more Arabic influenced 'medical' aspects of natural philosophy.\" Indeed, it seems likely that Scot made use of several Aristotelian and Pseudo-Aristotelian works in the writing of the \"Liber physiognomiae\", many of which were derived from Arabic copies. The first of these is an Arabic translation of the \"Historia Animalium\". The second is the \"Kitāb Sirr al-Asrār\" (; known in Latin as the \"Secreta Secretorum\"), an Arabic text that purports to be a letter from Aristotle to his student Alexander the Great on a range of topics, including physiognomy. The third of these works is \"Physiognomonics\", also attributed to Aristotle and, as the title suggests, also about physiognomy; the influence of this Pseudo-Aristotelian work, according to Haskins, is \"limited to the preface\" of the \"Liber physiognomiae\". Scot probably used the original Greek version of \"Physiognomonics\" to write his book. The historian Charles Homer Haskins argues that the \"Liber physiognomiae\" also \"makes free use\" of Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (also known as Rhazes) and shows \"some affinities\" with Trotula texts and writers of the Schola Medica Salernitana (a medical school located in the Italian town of Salerno).\n\nThe work was written sometime in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to Frederick II. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written for the soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in AD 1209 on the occasion of his wedding to Constance of Aragon. Brown also adds, \"No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost fescennine license which it contains.\" The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that \"the emperor [might be able] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers.\"\n\nWhile manuscripts of the \"Liber quatuor distinctionum\" and the \"Liber particularis\" exist, the \"Liber physiognomiae\" was the only book from the \"Liber introductorius\" trilogy to be professionally printed, with a first print of the book being released in 1477. Between the date of its official printing and 1660, the work was reprinted eighteen times in many languages; this popularity of the text led Rudolf Hirsch (a book scholar) in 1950 to call the book one of the Middle Ages' \"best sellers\". The number of reprints and its wide circulation is attributed in large part to the advent of the printing press in 1440. Among the many reprints, there is little evidence of textual changes, which is unique for manuscripts published and then transmitted in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe \"Liber physiognomiae\" was often bundled with other, topically-similar texts. For instance, some copies of Scot's book were combined with a work by pseudo-Albertus Magnus entitled \"De secretis mulierum\" (\"Concerning the Secrets of Women\"), which, according to the \"Dictionary of National Biography\", suggests the opinion of the time was that Scot \"dealt with forbidden subjects, or at least subjects better left to medical science.\" Extracts from the \"Liber physiognomiae\" also appear in many early printed versions of Johannes de Ketham's medical treatise \"Fasciculus Medicinae\" (although this is not the case for all early copies). Finally, in 1515 a compendium titled \"Phisionomia Aristotellis, cum commanto Micaelis Scoti\" was published, which featured the \"Liber physiognomiae\" of Scot, alongside physiognomical works by Aristotle and Bartolomeo della Rocca.\n\nAccording to Porter, Scot's \"Liber physiognomiae\" was influential for three main reasons: First, Scot developed a number of physiognomical aphorisms. Given the popularity of the \"Liber physiognomiae\", Scot's new formulations and ideas, according to Porter, \"introduce[d] some fundamental changes into the structure and nature of the physiognomical aphorism.\" (Effectively, what Scot did was add new meanings to various physical features, making the physiognomical signs discussed in the \"Liber physiognomiae\" more complex and, as Porter writes, \"polyvalent.\") Second, Scot developed a \"stronger conceptual link between physiognomy, issues of hereditary, embryology, and generation, which he articulated through astrological ideas of conception.\" Porter argues that this was done because the book was written by Scot to help Frederick II pick a suitable wife (and thus, by extension, produce a suitable heir). Third and finally, Scot's \"Liber physiognomiae\" seems to be the first physiognomical work that takes smell into account. According to Porter, this \"totalization\" of physiognomythat is, connecting it to a variety of subjects like reproduction and sense perceptionwas the most dramatic change that occurred in the way that physiognomy was practiced \"as it developed in the period between classical Athens and late fifteenth-century Europe\".\n\n<br> \n"}

{"id": "4349679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4349679", "title": "Metaphysical naturalism", "text": "Metaphysical naturalism\n\nMetaphysical naturalism (also called ontological naturalism, philosophical naturalism, scientific materialism and antisupernaturalism) is a philosophical worldview, which holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the natural sciences. Methodological naturalism is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is religious naturalism or spiritual naturalism. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the supernatural concepts and explanations that are part of many religions.\n\nAccording to Steven Schafersman, geologist and president of Texas Citizens for Science, metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that: 1. Nature encompasses all that exists throughout space and time; 2. Nature (the universe or cosmos) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal physical substance—mass–energy. Non-physical or quasi-physical substance, such as information, ideas, values, logic, mathematics, intellect, and other emergent phenomena, either supervene upon the physical or can be reduced to a physical account; 3. Nature operates by the laws of physics and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; and 4. the supernatural does not exist, i.e., only nature is real. Naturalism is therefore a metaphysical philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism.\n\nCarl Sagan put it succinctly: \"The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.\"\n\nAccording to Arthur C. Danto, naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is \"natural\" in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.\n\nRegarding the vagueness of the general term \"naturalism\", David Papineau traces the current usage to philosophers in early 20th century America such as John Dewey, Ernest Nagel, Sidney Hook, and Roy Wood Sellars: \"So understood, 'naturalism' is not a particularly informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized—that is, they would both reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'\". Papineau remarks that philosophers widely regard naturalism as a \"positive\" term, and \"few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists'\", while noting that \"philosophers concerned with religion tend to be less enthusiastic about 'naturalism'\" and that despite an \"inevitable\" divergence due to its popularity, if more narrowly construed, (to the chagrin of John McDowell, David Chalmers and Jennifer Hornsby, for example), those not so disqualified remain nonetheless content \"to set the bar for 'naturalism' higher\".\n\nPhilosopher and theologian Alvin Plantinga, a well-known critic of naturalism in general, comments: \"Naturalism is presumably not a religion. In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: it can be said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions\".\n\nMetaphysical naturalism is an approach to metaphysics or ontology, which deals with existence \"per se\". It should not be confused with methodological naturalism, which sees empiricism as the basis for the scientific method.\n\nRegarding science and evolution, Eugenie C. Scott, a notable opponent of teaching creationism or intelligent design in US public schools, stresses the importance of separating metaphysical from methodological naturalism:\n\nThe historian Richard Carrier, in his book \"Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism,\" describes metaphysical naturalism thus: as a philosophy \"wherein worship is replaced with curiosity, devotion with diligence, holiness with sincerity, ritual with study, and scripture with the whole world and the whole of human learning\". Carrier wrote that it is the naturalist’s duty \"to question all things and have a well-grounded faith in what is well-investigated and well-proved, rather than what is merely well-asserted or well-liked\".\n\nMetaphysical naturalism is the philosophical basis of science as described by Kate and Vitaly (2000) \"There are certain philosophical assumptions made at the base of the scientific method — namely, 1) that reality is objective and consistent, 2) that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that 3) rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded. Philosophy is at least implicitly at the core of every decision we make or position we take, it is obvious that correct philosophy is a necessity for scientific inquiry to take place.\" Steven Schafersman, agrees that methodological naturalism is \"the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within scientific method with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is.\"\n\nContrary to other notable opponents of teaching Creationism or Intelligent Design in US public schools such as Eugenie Scott, Schafersman asserts that \"while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism\". as well as the similarly controversial assertion: \"I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled.\" On the other hand, Scott argues:\n\nContemporary naturalists possess a wide diversity of beliefs within metaphysical naturalism. Most metaphysical naturalists have adopted some form of materialism or physicalism.\n\nMetaphysical naturalists argue that the scientific facts and theories that we have to explain the origins of the universe provide no evidence for supernatural beings or deities. As Richard Carrier explains:\n...no other worldview is directly and substantially supported by any scientific evidence, whereas all scientific evidence so far does support Metaphysical Naturalism, often directly, sometimes substantially. Though naturalism has not yet been proved, it is the best bet going.\n\nOne might say that either it has always existed or it had a purely natural origin, being neither created nor designed.\n\nSince nature is all there is, and there was once no life, abiogenesis is implied: that life arose spontaneously from natural causes. Naturalists reason about \"how\", not \"if\" evolution happened. They maintain that humanity's existence is not by intelligent design but rather a natural process of emergence.\n\nSome embrace virtue ethics and many see no compelling argument against ethical naturalism. Some may advocate for a Science of morality. One example of an attempt to ground a naturalist meta-ethical system is Richard Carrier's chapter \"Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)\" which was peer reviewed by four philosophers. It sets out to prove a Moral realism centered around human satisfaction. Alexander Rosenberg has expressed a contrary position that naturalists, in general, have to accept moral nihilism.\n\nIf any variety of metaphysical naturalism is true, any mental properties that exist are caused by and ontologically dependent upon nature.\n\nMetaphysical naturalists do not believe in a soul or spirit, nor in ghosts, and when explaining what constitutes the mind they rarely appeal to substance dualism. If one's mind, or rather one's identity and existence as a person, is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as ideas, theories, emotions, moral and personal values, or aesthetic response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.\n\nMetaphysical naturalists hold that reason is the refinement and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of pure reason alone can securely discover logical errors.\n\nHumans are social animals, which is why humanity developed culture and civilization. In terms of evolution, this means that differential reproductive success somehow depended on traits that permit the development and maintenance of a healthy and productive culture and civilization.\n\nNaturalism was the foundation of two (Vaisheshika, Nyaya) of the six orthodox schools and one (Carvaka) heterodox school of Hinduism. The Carvaka, Nyaya, Vaisheshika schools originated in the 7th, 6th, and 2nd century BCE, respectively.\n\nWestern metaphysical naturalism has originated in ancient Greek philosophy. The earliest pre-Socratic philosophers, especially the Milesians (Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes) and the atomists (Leucippus and Democritus), were labeled by their peers and successors \"the \"physikoi\"\" (from the Greek φυσικός or \"physikos\", meaning \"natural philosopher,\" borrowing on the word φύσις or \"physis\", meaning \"nature\") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as Epicureanism, which sought to explain everything that exists as the product of atoms falling and swerving in a void.\n\nAristotle surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.\n\nWith the rise and dominance of Christianity in the West and the later spread of Islam, metaphysical naturalism was generally abandoned by intellectuals. Thus, there is little evidence for it in medieval philosophy. The reintroduction of Aristotle's empirical epistemology as well as previously lost treatises by Greco-Roman natural philosophers which was begun by the medieval Scholastics without resulting in any noticeable increase in commitment to naturalism.\n\nIt was not until the early modern era of philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment that naturalists like Benedict Spinoza (who put forward a theory of psychophysical parallelism), David Hume, and the proponents of French materialism (notably Denis Diderot, Julien La Mettrie, and Baron d'Holbach) started to emerge again in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this period, some metaphysical naturalists adhered to a distinct doctrine, materialism, which became the dominant category of metaphysical naturalism widely defended until the end of the 19th century.\n\nImmanuel Kant rejected (reductionist) materialist positions in metaphysics, but he was not hostile to naturalism. His transcendental philosophy is considered to be a form of liberal naturalism.\n\nIn late modern philosophy, \"Naturphilosophie\", a form of natural philosophy, was developed by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel as an attempt to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure.\n\nA politicized version of naturalism that has arisen after Hegel was Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels's dialectical materialism, especially Engels's dialectical philosophy of nature (\"Dialectics of Nature\").\n\nAnother notable school of late modern philosophy advocating naturalism was German materialism: members included Ludwig Büchner, Jacob Moleschott, and Karl Vogt.\n\nIn the early 20th century, matter was found to be a form of energy and therefore not fundamental as materialists had assumed. (See History of physics.) In contemporary philosophy, renewed attention to the problem of universals, philosophy of mathematics, the development of mathematical logic, and the post-positivist revival of metaphysics and the philosophy of religion, initially by way of Wittgensteinian linguistic philosophy, further called the naturalistic paradigm into question. Developments such as these, along with those within science and the philosophy of science brought new advancements and revisions of naturalistic doctrines by naturalistic philosophers into metaphysics, ethics, the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mind, epistemology, etc., the products of which include physicalism and eliminative materialism, supervenience, causal theories of reference, anomalous monism, naturalized epistemology (e.g. reliabilism), internalism and externalism, ethical naturalism, and property dualism, for example.\n\nA politicized version of naturalism that has arisen in contemporary philosophy is Ayn Rand's Objectivism. Objectivism is an expression of capitalist ethical idealism within a naturalistic framework.\n\nThe current usage of the term naturalism \"derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included John Dewey, Ernest Nagel, Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars.\"\n\nCurrently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the natural sciences and the Anglo-American, analytic philosophical communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include J. J. C. Smart, David Malet Armstrong, David Papineau, Paul Kurtz, Brian Leiter, Daniel Dennett, Michael Devitt, Fred Dretske, Paul and Patricia Churchland, Mario Bunge, Jonathan Schaffer, Hilary Kornblith, Quentin Smith, Paul Draper and Michael Martin, among many other academic philosophers.\n\nAccording to David Papineau, contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the \"causal closure of the physical\", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.\n\nAccording to Steven Schafersman, president of Texas Citizens for Science, an advocacy group opposing creationism in public schools, the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism—and later of metaphysical naturalism—followed the advances of science and the increase of its explanatory power. These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as existentialism.\n\nIn the context of creation and evolution debates, Internet Infidels co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder argues against what he calls \"the argument from bias\", that \"a priori,\" the supernatural is merely ruled out due to an unexamined stipulation. Lowder believes \"there are good empirical reasons for believing that metaphysical naturalism is true, and therefore a denial of the supernatural need not be based upon an \"a priori\" assumption\".\n\nRichard Carrier argues in \"Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism\" that Metaphysical Naturalism is true. Topics covered include metaphilosophy, semantics, epistemology, the nature and origin of the universe (including a proposal that spacetime may be the ground of all being and a rejection of the logical possibility for any ultimate answer), free will compatibilism, the nature of mind, abstract objects, ontological reductionism, the nature of emotions, the meaning of life, the nature of reason, atheism, aesthetics, morality (including ethical naturalism and a recommendation for a science of morality), and politics.\n\nSeveral Metaphysical Naturalists have used the trends in scientific discoveries about minds to argue that no supernatural minds exist. For instance, Lowder says, \"Since all known mental activity has a physical basis, there are probably no disembodied minds. But God is conceived of as a disembodied mind. Therefore, God probably does not exist.\" Lowder argues the correlation between mind and brain implies that supernatural souls do not exist because the theist position, according to Lowder, is that the mind depends upon this soul instead of the brain.\n\nArguments against metaphysical naturalism include the following examples.\n\nAlvin Plantinga is the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy at Calvin College. He is a Christian, and a well-known critic of naturalism. He argues, in his evolutionary argument against naturalism, that the probability that evolution has produced humans with reliable true beliefs, is low or inscrutable, unless their evolution was guided, for example, by God. According to David Kahan of the University of Glasgow, in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of supernatural theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology. \"(See also supernormal stimuli).\"\n\nPlantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable \"\"defeater\" for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable\", i.e., a skeptical argument along the lines of Descartes' evil demon or brain in a vat.\n\nBranden Fitelson of the University of California, Berkeley and Elliott Sober of the University of Wisconsin–Madison argue that Plantinga must show that the combination of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that \"at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true\", and that defects such as cognitive bias are nonetheless consistent with being made in the image of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's hyperbolic doubt is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: \"[neither] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism.\" Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by philosopher Daniel Dennett and historian Richard Carrier who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.\n\nEdward Feser, in his 2008 book \"The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism\", lays a plenary case against naturalism by re-examining pre-Modern philosophy. Beginning in the second chapter, Feser cites the Platonic and Aristotelian answers to the problem of universals—that is, realism. Feser also offers arguments against nominalism. And by defending realism and rejecting nominalism, he rejects eliminative materialism—and thus naturalism.\n\nIn the third chapter, Feser summarizes three of Thomas Aquinas's arguments for the existence of God. These include arguments for an unmoved mover, first, uncaused cause and (supernatural) supreme intelligence, concluding that these must exist not as a matter of probability—as in the intelligent design view, particularly of irreducible complexity—but as a necessary consequence of \"obvious, though empirical, starting points\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Order's statute was amended on September 7, 2010 by presidential decree 1099, the same document that established the Medal of the Order of Parental Glory.\n\nThe Order of Parental Glory is awarded to parents or adoptive parents who are married, in a civil union, or in the case of single-parent families, to one of the parents or adoptive parents who are/is raising, or have raised seven or more children as citizens of the Russian Federation. For leading a healthy family life, being socially responsible, providing an adequate level of health care, education, physical, spiritual and moral development of the children, full and harmonious development of their personality, and setting an example to strengthen the institution of the family and child rearing.\n\nThe award is made when the seventh child reaches the age of three, and in the presence of the other living children, except in the cases of older children who were killed or missing in action in defence of the Fatherland or its interests, in the performance of military, official or civic duties, who died as a result of injury, concussion or disease received in these circumstances, either because of occupational injury or illness.\n\nThe Russian Federation Order of Precedence dictates that the Order of Parental Glory is to be worn on the left breast with other orders and medals immediately after the Order of Friendship.\n\nThe badge of the Order is a 70 mm wide gilt silver cross pattée, with arms that are flared towards the concave outer ends. The cross obverse is enamelled in blue. At its center is a circular red enamelled medallion edged in gold and bearing the gilded coat of arms of the Russian Federation. A green enamelled laurel wreath passes under and near the outer ends of the cross. Golden rays extend between the cross's arms to the laurel wreath.

The theory held that foods, especially grain, were purposely withheld from them, for the benefit of privileged interest groups. During this period French citizens obtained much of their nourishment from grain.\n\nThe famine plot has roots in pre-revolutionary France, while some of its strongest manifestations were evident during the 1760s and 1770s. The collective mentality surrounding this conspiracy served as a tool for French citizens to make sense of the political environment at the time.\n\nBetween 1715 and 1789 the population of France increased by 6 million, from 22 million. Population growth and demographic changes during the 18th century help to explain the high demand for food, and lack of food supply at the time. Many faced hunger due to scarcity of food, and found it difficult to fend off illness. At times \"bad grain\" was blamed for making citizens sick.\n\nFrom 1715–1774 Louis XV was the ruling King of France. During his reign many people faced famine and other struggles, living in a society in need of reform. Louis the XV was criticized for his lack of leadership, which hindered necessary reforms from being made. In 1774 when his successor Louis XVI took the throne, he worked early on to restore order within the kingdom. One of the first things he did was appoint Jacques Turgot as the Minister of Finances.\n\nTurgot followed members of an early version of free market economics emerging in France at the time, inspired by Confucian teachings, known as Physiocracy. The physiocrats, or \"économistes\" as they called themselves, wanted to move away from Mercantilism, and felt it was possible to produce more value from the land. Dr. Francois Quesnay, Dupont de Nemours, and Vincent de Gournay were important pioneers of this movement and had a great impact on Turgot. Vincent de Gournay was the free market Intendant for Commerce and he and Turgot spent extensive time together. De Gournay’s opinion on what government economic policy should be was summarized in the term he laid claim to: \"laissez faire, laissez passer\", meaning leave it alone and let it pass, also known as the \"invisible hand\" notion. This economic principle did not favor government regulation and involvement in commerce. Turgot passionately defended Gournay’s belief in \"laissez-faire\" economic principles in his writing \"Éloge de Gournay\".\n\nBefore his appointment Turgot acted as Intendant of Limognes from 1761–1774. He had worked to implement free market reforms on a local scale. While acting as the Minister of Finances he worked to implement these reforms on a larger national scale. During his short time in office, Turgot established free trade in grain, worked to rectify the financial situation in France (focusing on industry and agriculture), and reform the system so that feudal privileges no longer existed.\n\nIn his efforts to revive the agricultural system, Turgot altered the urban production process. In 1775 he did away with guilds and moved the grain trade to a free trade system, removing police regulations.\n\nIn 18th century France, the role of police was far more involved than simply upholding the law. Police held responsibility over many systems in society, even street sweeping. The notion at the time was that all systems needed administrative managing, and that only the police could be trusted with keeping them in order. Once the guild system was transformed, to gain back a sense of control, police made it difficult for business owners to obtain licenses, by making applicants prove themselves \"moral and solvent\". These were businesses that Turgot had ordered be opened.\n\nThe guild dissolution prompted workers to riot, and social unruliness became a normal state of affairs. Guild members argued that this shift would lead to a more corporate system that would cause people to lose their sense of social identity, and that chaos and instability would result.\n\nChanges to grain and bread supply had serious implications, and was met with even more disorder than was seen over the change in the guild system. This conflict was known as the Flour War of 1775. Reports from those that controlled the flow of grain stated there were problems with the grain harvest which caused shortages and less grain availability. The price of grain also increased, and became hard for some to afford. News of a grain shortage was met with skepticism and frustration rose from higher prices.\n\nAll tiers of society, including the poor, police, and members of government felt that the disruption of the grain and flour was done not for their sake, but to satisfy the agendas of interest groups, looking to make more money. They felt taken advantage of at the expense of their hunger. Those in opposition of the reform rioted, and seized grain that came in on shipments. They offered what they felt was the “just price” for it. This demonstrated a way in which the people took some power back into their own hands. This practice was known as “taxation populaire”, or popular taxation.\n\nWhile there were documented efforts to deal with the grain shortage problems, such as increasing shipments from external sources, belief in the famine plot conspiracy remained. Conspiracy propaganda was rampant and quickly spread through the public. It eventually even reached Jacques Turgot, who came to have his own doubts about the situation. He suspected “agitation and bribery by his political rivals”.\n\nThe disorder of the period proved to be so great that this economic experiment was stopped, and Turgot ended his career as the Minister of Finances in 1776. From 1775–1776 police returned to regulate the grain trade. Guilds were re-instated as well, but took a new form due to social changes taking place.\n\nFrance would survive these food shortages, and a new era of industrialization would eventually emerge. Agricultural techniques would become more modernized and productivity would increase over the next century, improving the life of many in France.\n\n\n"}

Cartesianism tempered by the modifications introduced into it by Leibniz, Wolff, and Genovesi, was the system in which Galluppi's mind was trained. The problem of human knowledge was his chief preoccupation. He maintained the objective reality of our knowledge, which he based on the testimony of consciousness, making us aware not only of our internal experience, but also of the external causes to which it is due. This theory was aimed at Kant, though Galluppi agreed with him that space and time are \"a priori\" forms in the mind. Against the sensists, he denied that the mind was merely passive or receptive, and held that like a builder it arranged and ordered the materials supplied it, deducing therefrom new truths which sensation alone could never reach. He threw no light, however, on the difference between sensory and intellectual knowledge. This was the great weakness of his argument against the Scottish school, that the soul perceives not only its own affections or the qualities of bodies, but also its own substance and that of things outside itself. It was also natural that Galluppi should be foremost in attacking the theories of Rosmini concerning the idea of God as the first object of our knowledge: and it was this polemic (quiet enough in itself) which drew public attention to the Roveretan philosopher.\n\nThe morality of our actions, according to Galluppi, depends on the notion of duty which springs from the very nature of man. He never made use of the phrase \"categoric imperative\", but everything goes to show that on that point he did not completely escape Kant's influence: and although he asserted as the two great moral commandments \"Be just\" and \"Be beneficent\", he nonetheless approved of Kant's moral principle. Hence we do not find in him any hint as to the connection between the moral law and God, beyond the statement that God must reward virtue and punish vice. Against the Scottish school, on the other hand, he denied that morality depends on the feelings. His theodicy is well within the limits of that of Leibniz, and therefore admits not only the possibility of revelation, but also the divinity of Christianity. The care and clearness of his style made his works very popular; but when the Hegelianism of the Neapolitan school became the fashion in non-Catholic circles of thought, and Scholasticism regained its hold among Catholics, Galluppi's philosophy quickly lost ground. He always kept aloof from political questions; and his works were planned and written in his own home, amidst the noise and bustle of a large and happy family.\n\n"}

The elided VP can be interpreted in at least two ways, as follows:\n\n\nThe discussion of “sloppy identity” amongst linguists dates back to a paper by John Robert Ross in 1967, in which Ross identified the interpretational ambiguity in the elided Verb Phrase of the previously stated sentence 1) found in the intro.

Most notable of these advances are Lawrence Bouton's VP-Deletion rule (1970), Barbara Partee’s “Derived-VP rule” (1975), and Ivan Sag’s “Deletion Approach” (1976), based on the Derived-VP rule. It should be noted that theories beyond Ross's initial discovery have all extended beyond analyses based on observations of structural relations, often using logical form and phonetic form to account of instances of sloppy and strict identity. The deletion (derived VP) approach, in combination with the use of logical form (LF) and phonetic form (PF) components to syntax, is one of the most widely used syntactic analysis of sloppy identity to date.\n\nThis model represents the interface level of the phonological system and interpretive system that give us judgements of form and meaning of D-structure. Early theorists seemed to suggest that phonetic form and logical form are two distinct approaches for explaining the derivation of VP ellipsis.\n\nScholars like Noam Chomsky (1955), Ross (1969) and Sag (1976) have suggested the process responsible for VP ellipsis is a syntactic deletion rule applied at the level of PF, this process is named as VP Deletion.\n\nThe PF-deletion hypothesis assumes the elided VP is fully syntactically represented but deleted in the phonological component between SPELLOUT and PF. It suggests that VP deletion is the process that generates sloppy identities because co-indexation needs to occur with respect to binding conditions.\n\nExample\n\nLooking at example 2.i), VP deletion is why a null VP is derived. Before deletion, as seen in example 2.ii), the sentence would in fact be read as “John will eat his apple, and Sam will eat his apple too.” The clauses [John will eat his apple] and [Sam will eat his apple] share an identical VP in the sense they have the same constituent structure, so the second clause can be deleted because it is identical to its antecedent VP.\n\nNow turning to coindexation, this sentence contains two constituents combined by the conjunction “and”. The clauses are each independent complete sentence structures, so presumably each pronoun would co-index to its referent in its constituent to comply with binding theories. With this co-indexation, illustrated in example 2. ii), a sloppy reading is produced.\n\nHowever, when considering cases sensitive to binding theories, the expected strict reading of sentence 3) would violate the Binding Principle A. According to this principle, an anaphor must be bound in its binding domain, meaning it must be bound within the same clause as its referent.\n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading:\n\nTaking this into consideration, it is observed that strict readings are difficult to be obtained in sentences like this, because if the anaphor \"himself\" in the elided VP is co-indexed with ‘John’ it would violate Binding Theory A because they are in separate clauses. C-command relationships are represented by colour coding in the sytnax tree. As depicted in the tree diagram and illustrated in green, ‘John’ c-commands 'himself' in the first VP. 'Bill' on the other hand c-commands 'himself' in the second VP, colour coded in orange. Due to binding domains, the DPs closest to the anaphors have to be the ones they bind to and co-index with. Therefore, 'John' cannot not c-command the 'himself' in the second VP, as shown through the difference in colour coding. Consequently, Binding Theory A would be violated if the co-indexation of example 2.i) generates a strict reading. Hence, PF-deletion hypothesis generates sloppy readings because it treats the elided VP as identical structures to the antecedent VP and co-indexation is constrained by locality.\n\nAccording to Carnie, the sloppy identity problem can be explained using an LF-copying hypothesis. This hypothesis claims that before SPELLOUT, the elided VP has no structure and exists as an empty or null VP (as opposed to the PF-deletion hypothesis, which asserts that the elided VP has structure throughout the derivation). Only by copying structure from the VP antecedent does it have structure at LF. These copying processes occur covertly from SPELLOUT to LF.\n\nAccording to LF-copying, the ambiguity found in sloppy identity is due to different orderings of the copying rules for pronouns and verbs. Consider the following derivations of the sloppy reading and the strict reading for sentence (4), using the Covert VP-Copying Rule and the Anaphor-Copying Rule:\n\nSloppy reading\n\nIn the sloppy reading, the VP-copying rule applies first, as can be seen in sentence 5). The VP-copying rule copies the VP in the antecedent into the empty VP:\n\nCovert VP-copying rule\n\nFollowing the VP-copying rule, the anaphor-copying rule applies, as can be seen in sentence 6). The anaphor-copying rule, which is clause-bound, copies NPs into anaphors within the same clause:\n\nCovert anaphor-copying rule\n\nStrict reading\n\nIn the strict reading, the application of these rules occur in the opposite order. Therefore, the anaphor-copying rule is applied first. Due to the fact that the empty VP does not contain an anaphor, the NP “Otto” cannot be copied into it. This process can be seen in sentence 7):\n\nCovert anaphor-copying rule\n\nFollowing the anaphor-copying rule, the VP-copying rule applies and produces the sentence in 8):\n\nCovert VP-copying rule\n\nThe derivation used in this LF copying hypothesis can be found here.\n\nBuilding on the work of Bouton (1970) and Ross (1969), Barbara Partee (1975) developed what has come to be one of the most important and influential approaches to explain VP to date, the \"Derived VP-Rule\", which introduces a null operator at the VP level. Shortly thereafter, Ivan A. Sag (1976) developed the \"Deletion Derived VP approach\", and Edwin S. Williams (1977) developed the \"Interpretive Derived VP Approach\". These rules are still used by many today.\n\nDerived VP-rule:\n\nAccording to Williams (1977), the Derived VP Rule converts VPs in surface structure into properties written in lambda notation. This is a very important rule that has been built on over the years to make sense of sloppy identity. This VP-rule is used by many linguists as a foundation for their ellipsis rules.\n\nIvan Sag proposed two logical forms, one of which the coreferential pronoun is replaced by a bound variable. This leads to the rule of semantic interpretation that takes pronouns and changes them into bound variables. This rule is abbreviated as Pro→BV, where “Pro” stands for pronoun, and “BV” stands for bound variable.\n\nSimple sentence example\n\nThe strict reading of sentence 9) is that “Betsy loves her own dog”. Application of Pro→BV then derives the sentence in 9.i):\n\nWhere her is someone else or x's is anyone else's dog\n\nComplex example\n\nwhere ∅ = loves her dog\n\nStrict reading\n\nThe strict reading of 10) is \"Betsy loves Betsy’s dog and Sandy loves Betsy’s dog as well\", which implies that ∅ is a VP that has been deleted. This is represented in the following sentence:\n\nThe VPs that are being represented by λx and λy are syntactically identical. For this reason the one that is being c-commanded (λy) can be deleted.\n\nThis then forms:\n\nSloppy reading\n\nThe sloppy reading of this sentence is \"Betsy loves Betsy’s dog and Sandy loves Sandy’s dog\". That is, both women love their own dog. This is represented in the following sentence:\n\nSince the embedded clauses are identical, the logic of this form is that the variable x must be bound to the same noun phrase in both cases. Therefore, “Betsy” is in the commanding position that determines the interpretation of the second clause.\n\nThe Pro → BV rule that converts pronouns into bound variables can be applied to all the pronouns.\n\nThis then allows for the sentence in 10.iii) to be:\n\nAnother way the VP can be syntactically identical is, if λx(A) and λy(B) where every instance of x in A has a corresponding instance of y in B. So, like in the example above, for all instances of x there is a corresponding instance of y and therefore they are identical and the VP that is being c-commanded can be deleted.\n\nIn Sag's approach, VP Ellipsis is analyzed as a deletion that takes place in between S-structure (Shallow Structure) and PF (Surface Structure). It is claimed that the deleted VP is recoverable at the level of LF due to alphabetic variance holding between two λ-expressions. In this deletion approach, the sloppy identity is made possible, first, by the indexing of anaphors, and then by the application of a variable rewriting rule.\n\nThe following is a step by step derivation, taking into consideration both phonetic and logical forms, accounting for a sloppy reading of the sentence “John blamed himself, and Bill did too.”\n\nLF mapping\n\nDeep structure to surface structure:\n\nIn this sentence, the VP's [blamed himself] are present, but are not yet referencing any subject. In sentence 12), the Derived VP Rule is applied, rewriting these VP's using lambda notation.\n\nDerived VP Rule\n\nThe Derived VP Rule has derived two VPs containing separate λ-operators with referential variables bound in each antecedent clause. The next rule, Indexing, co-indexes Anaphors and Pronouns to their subjects.\n\nIndexing\n\nAs we see, the anaphors have been co-indexed to their respective NPs. Lastly, The Variable Rewriting Rule replaces pronouns and anaphors with variables in logical form.\n\nPro-->BV\n\nLogical form:\n\nPF Mapping\n\nDeep Structure to Surface Structure:\n\nHere we see that both John and Bill precede the same VP, [blame himself]. It is important to note that any meaning, in this case what Subject the Anaphor “himself” references, is determined at LF, and thus left out of phonetic form.\n\nVP-deletion\n\nVP Deletion occurs, which in effect deletes the VP [blame himself] from the second clause Bill [blame himeself]. Again, it is important to keep in mind that this deletion occurs strictly at the phonetic level, and thus [blame himself] still exists in the LF component, despite it being deleted in PF.\n\nDo-support\n\nPhonetic form:\n\nLastly, Do-Support is implemented, filling the empty space created by VP Deletion with \"did\". This is the last step that occurs in PF, leaving the sentence to be phonetically realized as “John blamed himself, and Bill did too.” Due to the rules enacted in the LF component of the derivation, although did has phonetically replaced the VP [blame himself], its meaning is the same as what was established at LF. Thus, “Bill did too” can be sloppily interpreted as “Bill blamed himself”, as in “Bill blamed Bill”.\n\nIn his approach to the sloppy identity problem, Williams (1977) adopts the Derived VP Rule as well. He also suggests that anaphors and pronouns are rewritten as variables at LF by a Variable Rewriting Rule. Afterwards, by using the VP Rule, these variables are then copied into the elided VP. Following this approach, both the sloppy and strict readings are possible. The following examples will go through the derivation of sentence 18.i) as a sloppy reading:\n\nSloppy reading\n\nAs can be seen in this sentence, the VP contains no structure. In sentence 19.i), the Derived VP Rule, which re-writes the VP using lambda notation, is applied:\n\nDerived VP Rule\n\nNext, the Variable Rewriting Rule transforms pronouns and anaphors into variables at LF:\n\nVariable Rewriting Rule\n\nThe VP Rule then copies the VP structure into the elided VP:\n\nVP Rule\n\nThe main difference between the sloppy and the strict reading lies in the Variable Rewriting Rule. The presence of this rule allows for a sloppy reading because variables are bound by the lambda operator within the same VP. By converting the pronoun \"his\" in 20.i) into a variable, and once the VP is copied into the elided VP in sentence 21.i), the variable in the elided VP is then able to be bound by Bill. Therefore, in order to derive the strict reading, this step is simply omitted.\n\nStrict Reading\n\nThe VP is rewritten using lambda notation:\n\nDerived VP Rule\n\nThe VP structure is copied into the elided VP:\n\nVP Rule\n\nDue to the fact the pronoun \"his\" is already co-indexed with John, and it was not rewritten as a variable before being copied into the elided VP, there is no way for it to be bound by Bill. Therefore, the strict reading is thus derived by omitting the Variable Rewriting Rule.\n\nThe idea of ‘centering’, also known as ‘focusing’, has been discussed by numerous linguists, such as A. Joshi, S. Weinstein, and B. Grosz. This theory is based on the assumption that in conversation both participants share a psychological focus towards an entity that is central to their discourse. Hardt (2003), using this centering theoretical approach, suggests that in discourse, a shift of the focus from one entity to another makes it possible for sloppy readings to occur.\n\nIn the following two examples, the superscript * represents the current focus of discourse, while the subscript * signifies an entity which is in reference to the focus of discourse. Consider the following two examples:\n\nStrict reading \n\nIn the example above, there is no shift from the initial focus, thus the strict meaning arises, where both John and Bob scratched John's arm as John is where the focus is established and remains throughout discourse. Conversely, a shift in focus away from the initial discourse focus, like in the example below, gives rise to a sloppy reading.\n\nSloppy Reading \n\nNow the sloppy reading of the sentence arises, where John scratched his arm (John's arm) and Bob scratched his arm (Bob's arm). The shift in focus has included Bob as the primary noun and this allows the pronoun \"his\" to refer to its closest superscript *, in this case, Bob.\n\nIt must be noted that this is a simplified explanation of Centering Theory. This approach can be further explored in Hardt's 2003 paper. Although beyond the scope of this discussion, Hardt's use of Centering Theory may also explain the two pronoun ellipsis puzzle and two pronoun attitude puzzle, two puzzles which prior to Centering Theory could not be properly accounted for.\n\nInstances of sloppy identity have been observed across multiple languages, however, the majority of research has centered on instances of sloppy identity occurring in English. Cross linguistically, sloppy identity is analyzed as a universal problem, found in the basic underlying syntactic structure that all languages share. For non-English examples and analyses of sloppy identity, such as Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, see the following articles in the references section below. An in-depth explanation of sloppy identity in Mandarin also follows.\nIn the generative framework, it has been argued that the overt counterpart of \"do\"-support in English is the \"shì\"-support in Modern Mandarin. \nSimilar to the \"do\"-support, \"shì\"-support can allow constructions that are not fully developed. \n\nExample \n\nExpected strict reading:\n\nExpected sloppy reading:\n\nAs (1) indicates, both the strict and sloppy readings are equally available, similar to the case in English. \nThough \"shì\"-support can substitute state verbs in Modern Mandarin, such as \"xihuan\" (like), it is not compatible with all verb types. \nFor example, activity verbs standing alone are not always compatible with \"shì\"-support. \n\nExample \n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading: \n\nAs (2) indicates, both the strict and sloppy readings are equally available, however, the judgement of the sentences above can vary between native speakers of Modern Mandarin.\n\nTo improve the overall acceptability of the strict and sloppy reading of (2), Ai (2014) added adverbials to the antecedent clause. \n\nExample: \n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading: \n\nAs (3) indicates, both the strict and sloppy readings are equally available, however according to the aforementioned survey, native speakers of Modern Mandarin still prefer the sloppy reading over the strict one. It is questionable to analyze (3) based on addition of adverbials according to the diagnostic of equal distribution in both the strict and sloppy reading.\n\nNegation in shi-support and negation in English do-support do not function identically.\nWhen preceded by the negative \"bu\" (not), shi-support is not grammatical, regardless if the linguistic antecedent is affirmative or negative.\n\nExample: \n\nHowever, if the linguistic antecedent is negative, a negative reading can be provided by the shi-support, even though the shi-support is not preceded by the negative \"bu\" (not). \n\nExample: \n\nAdditionally, questions in shi-support and in English do-support do not function identically.\n\"Shi\" may not license ellipsis when the linguistic antecedent occurs in a question.\n\nExample:\n\nThe three essential properties of sloppy identity in Mandarin sluicing include: \n(1) c-commanding (2) lexical identity between wh-words and (3) na ‘that’ effect. \n\nRoss (1967) proposed that for an elided expression to have a sloppy identity, a pronoun relating to the reading must be c-commanded by its antecedent, as demonstrated in (8a). Otherwise, the sloppy identity is not available, as in (8b). Mandarin sluicing follows this constraint in (9). \n\nExample \n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading: \nExample \n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading: \n\nExample \n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading: \n\nExample \n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading: \n\nTo derive sloppy identity, “lexical” identity is required between the overt wh-correlate and the wh-remnant, independent of argument-adjunct distinction. This is also the case for Mandarin sluicing, for wh-adjunct identity in (9a) and wh-argument identity in (10). \n\nExample\n\nExpected strict reading: \n\nExpected sloppy reading: \n\nGiven these lexical identity restrictions, the derivation of the sloppy identity reading predicts that wh-antecedent is required to be overtly present, otherwise only the strict reading allowed.\n"}

{"id": "519343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519343", "title": "Transcendental idealism", "text": "Transcendental idealism\n\nTranscendental idealism is a doctrine founded by German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century. Kant's doctrine maintains that human experience of things is similar to the way they appear to us—implying a fundamentally subject-based component, rather than being an activity that directly (and therefore without any obvious causal link) comprehends the things as they are in themselves. The doctrine is most commonly presented as the idea that time and space are just human perceptions; they are not necessarily real concepts, just a medium through which humans internalize the universe.\nAlthough it influenced the course of subsequent German philosophy dramatically, exactly how to interpret this concept was a subject of some debate among 20th century philosophers. Kant first describes it in his \"Critique of Pure Reason\", and distinguished his view from contemporary views of realism and idealism, but philosophers do not agree how sharply Kant differs from each of these positions.\n\nTranscendental idealism is associated with \"formalistic idealism\" on the basis of passages from Kant's \"Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics\", although recent research has tended to dispute this identification. Transcendental idealism was also adopted as a label by the subsequent German philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, Arthur Schopenhauer, and in the early 20th century by Edmund Husserl in the novel form of transcendental-phenomenological idealism.\n\nKant presents an account of how we intuit () objects and accounts of space and of time. Before Kant, some thinkers, such as Leibniz, had come to the conclusion that space and time were not things, but only the relations among things. Other thinkers, including Newton, maintained that space and time were real things or substances. Leibniz had arrived at a radically different understanding of the universe and the things found in it. According to his \"Monadology\", all things that humans ordinarily understand as interactions between and relations among individuals (such as their relative positions in space and time) have their being in the mind of God but not in the Universe where we perceive them to be. In the view of realists, individual things interact by physical connection and the relations among things are mediated by physical processes that connect them to human brains and give humans a determinate chain of action to them and correct knowledge of them. Kant was aware of problems with both of these positions. He had been influenced by the physics of Newton and understood that there is a physical chain of interactions between things perceived and the one who perceives them. However, an important function of mind is to structure incoming data and to process it in ways that make it other than a simple mapping of outside data.\nThe salient element here is that space and time, rather than being real \"things-in-themselves\" or empirically mediated appearances (), are the very forms of intuition () by which we must perceive objects. They are hence neither to be considered properties that we may attribute to objects in perceiving them, nor substantial entities of themselves. They are in that sense subjective, yet necessary, preconditions of any given object insofar as this object is an appearance and not a \"thing-in-itself\". Humans necessarily perceive objects as located in space and in time. This condition of experience is part of what it means for a human to cognize an object, to perceive and understand it as something both spatial and temporal: \"By \"transcendental idealism\" I mean the doctrine that appearances are to be regarded as being, one and all, representations only, not things in themselves, and that time and space are therefore only sensible forms of our intuition…\" Kant argues for these several claims in the section of the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" entitled the \"Transcendental Aesthetic\". That section is devoted to inquiry into the \"a priori\" conditions of human sensibility, i.e. the faculty by which humans intuit objects. The following section, the \"Transcendental Logic\", concerns itself with the manner in which objects are thought.\n\nXenophanes of Colophon in 530 BC anticipated Kant's epistemology in his reflections on certainty. \"And as for certain truth, no man has seen it, nor will there ever be a man who knows about the gods and about all the things I mention. For if he succeeds to the full in saying what is completely true, he himself is nevertheless unaware of it; and Opinion (seeming) is fixed by fate upon all things.\" \nCertain interpretations of some of the medieval Buddhists of India, such as Dharmakirti, may reveal them to be transcendental idealists, since they seemed to hold the position of mereological nihilism but transcendental idealists who held that their minds were distinct from the atoms. Some Buddhists often attempt to maintain that the minds are equal to the atoms of mereological nihilist reality, but Buddhists seem to have no explanation of how this is the case, and much of the literature on the aforementioned Buddhists involves straightforward discussion of atoms and minds as if they are separate. This makes their position very similar to transcendental idealism, resembling Kant's philosophy where there are only things-in-themselves (which are very much like philosophical atoms), and phenomenal properties.\n\nBriefly, Schopenhauer described transcendental idealism as a \"distinction between the phenomenon and the thing in itself\", and a recognition that only the phenomenon is accessible to us because \"we know neither ourselves nor things as they are in themselves, but merely as they appear.\" Some of Schopenhauer's comments on the definition of the word \"transcendental\" are as follows: \n\nSchopenhauer contrasted Kant's transcendental critical philosophy with Leibniz's dogmatic philosophy. \n\nIn \"The Bounds of Sense\", P. F. Strawson suggests a reading of Kant's first \"Critique\" that, once accepted, forces rejection of most of the original arguments, including transcendental idealism. Strawson contends that, if Kant had followed out the implications of all that he said, he would have seen that there were many self-contradictions implicit in the whole.\n\nStrawson views the analytic argument of the \"transcendental deduction\" as the most valuable idea in the text, and regards transcendental idealism as an unavoidable error in Kant's greatly productive system. In Strawson's traditional reading (also favored in the work of Paul Guyer and Rae Langton), the Kantian term phenomena (literally something that can be seen from the Greek word \"phainomenon\", \"observable\") refers to the world of appearances, or the world of \"things\" sensed. They are tagged as \"phenomena\" to remind the reader that humans confuse these derivative appearances with whatever may be the forever unavailable \"things in themselves\" behind our perceptions. The necessary preconditions of experience, the components that humans bring to their apprehending of the world, the forms of perception such as space and time, are what make \"a priori\" judgments possible, but all of this process of comprehending what lies fundamental to human experience fails to bring anyone beyond the inherent limits of human sensibility. Kant's system requires the existence of noumena to prevent a rejection of external reality altogether, and it is this concept (senseless objects of which we can have no real understanding) to which Strawson objects in his book.\n\nIn \"Kant's Transcendental Idealism\", Henry E. Allison proposes a reading that opposes Strawson's interpretation. Allison argues that Strawson and others misrepresent Kant by emphasising what has become known as the two-worlds reading (a view developed by Paul Guyer). This—according to Allison, false—reading of Kant's phenomena/noumena distinction suggests that phenomena and noumena are ontologically distinct from each other. It concludes on that basis that we somehow fall short of knowing the noumena due to the nature of the very means by which we comprehend them. On such a reading, Kant would himself commit the very fallacies he attributes to the transcendental realists. On Allison's reading, Kant's view is better characterized as a two-aspect theory, where noumena and phenomena refer to complementary ways of considering an object. It is the dialectic character of knowing, rather than epistemological insufficiency, that Kant wanted most to assert.\n\nOpposing Kantian transcendental idealism is the doctrine of philosophical realism, that is, the proposition that the world is knowable as it really is, without any consideration of the knower's manner of knowing. This has been propounded by philosophers such as Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, Ralph Barton Perry, and Henry Babcock Veatch. Realism claims, contrary to idealism, that perceived objects exist in the way that they appear, in and of themselves, independent of a knowing spectator's mind.\n\n\n"}

Continuing in traditions of the masonic Religious-Philosophic Society, which had been run by their mentors - Dmitry Merezhkovsky and his wife Zinaida Gippius - the group critically accepted the revolution, but urged that people be free to express their spiritual beliefs.\n\nBy March 1918, the circle included at least 18 formally recognised members. The leaders were Fedorov and Alexander Meyer, who argued for the union (\"smychka\") of Christianity and social revolution (ibid.). The majority of participants of the circle were skeptical about the official position of the Russian Orthodox Church, believing that free development of Christian ideas within the Church was impossible. Meetings were held in the apartments of the Free Philosophical Association, though after they were closed in 1923, the meetings were held in the flats of K.A. Polovtsova (7 Maly Avenue of Petrogradskaya Side) and P.F. Smotritsky (18 Geslerovsky Lane); in 1917-28, no fewer than 150 people attended these meetings. \n\nThe main discussion themes included revolution and power, religion, and society. The painter Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin occasionally visited the circle's meetings, as did philologists M.M Bakhtin and Lev Pumpyansky, although Bakhtin and Pumpyansky appeared not to have any formal connection to the group (Hirschkop 1999: p. 168). In 1918, members of the circle issued a periodical, \"Free Voices\", although it proved to be short lived, it was published only twice, having been discontinued after opposition from Merezhkovsky.\n\nBy the end of 1919, the group officially assumed the name of \"Voskresenie\", which is the Russian word both for \"Sunday\" and for \"Resurrection\". The name reflected their hopes to see the social revolution \"resurrect\" spiritual freedoms. By this time eleven people formed the core of Voskresenie, and they organized the fraternity \"Christ and Freedom\", which secretly convened on Tuesdays and discussed the possibility of facilitating the merger of social revolution and Christianity. The fraternity was disbanded in 1923, on account of disagreements between its members.\n\nAfter Fedorov emigrated two years later, the society came to be dominated by Meyer, who used his charismatic aura and rhetorical skill to turn the circle into a sort of religious sect or masonic lodge. On 8 December 1928, when the society was about to mark its 10th anniversary, Meyer, Bakhtin, and (about 100) other individuals associated with Voskresenie were apprehended by the OGPU (Hirschkop 1999: p. 168). The subsequent trial resulted in the Voskresenie leaders being sentenced up to ten years in labour camps. Bakhtin was found guilty for his association with the circle and on 1929-07-22 he was sentenced to five years in Siberia. Approximately 70 people were sentenced by Decree of the Collegium of the Joint State Political Administration Board on 22 July 1929.\n\n\n"}
