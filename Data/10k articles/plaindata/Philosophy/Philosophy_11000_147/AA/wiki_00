Beard.\n\n\"An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States\" argues that the structure of the Constitution of the United States was motivated primarily by the personal financial interests of the Founding Fathers; Beard contends that the authors of \"The Federalist Papers\" represented an interest group themselves. More specifically, Beard contends that the Constitutional Convention was attended by, and the Constitution was therefore written by, a \"cohesive\" elite seeking to protect its personal property (especially federal bonds) and economic standing. Beard examined the occupations and property holdings of the members of the convention from tax and census records, contemporaneous news accounts, and biographical sources, demonstrating the degree to which each stood to benefit from various Constitutional provisions. Beard pointed out, for example, that George Washington was the wealthiest landowner in the country, and had provided significant funding towards the Revolution. Beard traces the Constitutional guarantee that the newly formed nation would pay its debts to the desire of Washington and similarly situated lenders to have their costs refunded.\n\nHistorian Carl L. Becker in \"History of Political Parties in the Province of New York, 1760–1776\" (1909) formulated the Progressive interpretation of the American Revolution. He said there were two revolutions: one against Britain to obtain home rule, and the other to determine who should rule at home. Charles A. Beard in \"An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States\" (1913) and \"Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy\" (1915) extended Becker's thesis down to 1800 in terms of class conflict. To Beard, the Constitution was a counter-revolution, set up by rich bond holders (bonds were \"personal property\"), in opposition to the farmers and planters (land was \"real property.\") The Constitution, Beard argued, was designed to reverse the radical democratic tendencies unleashed by the Revolution among the common people, especially farmers and debtors (people who owed money to the rich). In 1800, said Beard, the farmers and debtors, led by plantation slaveowners, overthrew the capitalists and established Jeffersonian democracy.\n\nOther historians supported the class conflict interpretation, noting that the states confiscated great semifeudal landholdings of Loyalists and gave them out in small parcels to ordinary farmers. Conservatives such as William Howard Taft were shocked at the Progressive interpretation because it seem to belittle the Constitution. History professors, however, mostly adopted it and by 1930 it became the standard interpretation of the era among them, but was largely ignored by the legal community.\n\nBeginning at around 1950, revisionist historians argued that the Progressive interpretation was factually incorrect; they were led by Charles A. Barker, Philip Crowl, Richard P. McCormick, William Pool, Robert Thomas, John Munroe, Robert E. Brown and B. Kathryn Brown, and especially Forrest McDonald. McDonald in \"We The People: The Economic Origins of the Constitution\" (1958) argued that Beard had misinterpreted the economic interests involved in writing the Constitution. Instead of two interests—landed and mercantile—which conflicted, McDonald asserted that there were three dozen identifiable interests that forced the delegates to bargain. Evaluating the debate, historian Peter Novick concluded:\n\nThe Progressive interpretation of the era was largely replaced by the intellectual history approach that stressed the power of ideas, especially republicanism, in stimulating the Revolution.\n\n\n"}

The body, as she expressed it, is multiple: it is more than one but it is also less than many (since the different versions of the body also overlap in health care practices). This is an empirical argument about ontology (which is the branch of philosophy that explores being, existence, or the categories of being.) As a part of this she also developed the notion of 'ontological politics', arguing that since realities or the conditions of possibility vary between practices, this means that they are not given but might be changed.\n\nMol has been member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2013. \n\nMol has written and worked with a range of scholars including John Law.\n\nIn a recent talk, Mol relates the concept of globalization to the interconnections of nature.\n\nIn 2004 she received the Ludwik Fleck Prize (Society for Social Studies of Science, 4S) for her book \"The Body Multiple\".\n\nIn 2012 she was awarded the Spinoza Prize.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "882192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882192", "title": "Brahmo Samaj", "text": "Brahmo Samaj\n\nBrahmo Samaj (Bengali: ব্রাহ্ম সমাজ \"Bramho Shômaj\") is the societal component of Brahmoism, which began as a monotheistic reformist movement of the Hindu religion that appeared during the Bengal Renaissance. It is practised today mainly as the Adi Dharm after its eclipse in Bengal consequent to the exit of the Tattwabodini Sabha from its ranks in 1839. After the publication of Hemendranath Tagore's Brahmo \"Anusthan\" (code of practice) in 1860 which formally divorced Brahmoism from Hinduism, the first Brahmo Samaj was founded in 1861 at Lahore by Pandit Nobin Chandra Roy.\n\nIt was one of the most influential religious movements in India and made a significant contribution to the making of modern India. It was started at Calcutta on 20 August 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Debendranath Tagore as reformation of the prevailing Brahmanism of the time (specifically Kulin practices) and began the Bengal Renaissance of the 19th century pioneering all religious, social and educational advance of the Hindu community in the 19th century. Its Trust Deed was made in 1830 formalising its inception and it was duly and publicly inaugurated in January 1830 by the consecration of the first house of prayer, now known as the Adi Brahmo Samaj. From the \"Brahmo Samaj\" springs Brahmoism, the most recent of legally recognised religions in India and Bangladesh, reflecting its foundation on reformed spiritual Hinduism with vital elements of Judeo-Islamic faith and practice.\n\nRaja Rammohan Roy founded Brahmo Samaj in 1828 in the name of Brahmo Sabha.\n\nThe Brahmo Samaj literally denotes community () of men who worship Brahman the highest reality. In reality Brahmo Samaj does not discriminate between caste, creed or religion and is an assembly of all sorts and descriptions of people without distinction, meeting publicly for the sober, orderly, religious and devout adoration of \"\"the (nameless) unsearchable Eternal, Immutable Being who is the Author and Preserver of the Universe\".\"\n\nThe following doctrines, as noted in Renaissance of Hinduism, are common to all varieties and offshoots of the \"Brahmo Samaj\":\n\n\n\nTo understand the differences between the two streams of Brahmo Samaj it is essential to understand that these implicit distinctions are based on caste. The Anusthanic Brahmos are exclusively either Brahmins or casteless, and exclusively adhere to Brahmoism and have no other faith. The Ananusthanic Brahmo Samajists, however, are from the remaining main caste divisions of Hinduism like Kayastha, Baidya etc. and hence within the Karmic / Rebirth wheel to eternally progress (i.e. \"Sanatan Dharm\") to God by moving up caste hierarchies, unlike anusthanic Brahmos for whom the next step after death is reintegration and renewal with 'God'.\n\nOn 20 August 1828 the first assembly of the \"Brahmo Sabha\" (progenitor of the Brahmo Samaj) was held at the North Calcutta house of \"Feringhee\" Kamal Bose. This day was celebrated by Brahmos as \"Bhadrotsab\" (ভাদ্রোৎসব \"Bhadrotshôb\" \"Bhadro celebration\"). These meetings were open to all Brahmins and there was no formal organisation or theology as such.\n\nOn 8 January 1830 influential progressive members of the closely related Kulin Brahmin clan scurrilously described as Pirali Brahmin \"ie.\" ostracised for service in the Mughal \"Nizaamat\" of Bengal) of Tagore (\"Thakur\") and Roy (\"Vandopādhyāya\") \"zumeendar\" family mutually executed the Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha for the first Adi Brahmo Samaj (place of worship) on Chitpore Road (now Rabindra Sarani), Kolkata, India with Ram Chandra Vidyabagish as first resident superintendent.\n\nOn 23 January 1830 or 11th \"Magh\", the \"Adi Brahmo\" premises were publicly inaugurated (with about 500 Brahmins and 1 Englishman present). This day is celebrated by Brahmos as \"Maghotsab\" (মাঘোৎসব \"Maghotshôb\" \"Magh celebration\").\n\nIn November 1830 Rammohun Roy left for England. Akbar II had conferred the title of 'Raja' to Rammohun Roy.\n\nWith Rammohun's departure for England in 1830, the affairs of Brahmo Sabha were effectively managed by Trustees Dwarkanath Tagore and Pandit Ram Chandra Vidyabagish, with Dwarkanath instructing his \"diwan\" to manage affairs.\n\nBy the time of Rammohun's death in 1833 near Bristol (UK), attendance at the \"Sabha\" dwindled and the Telugu Brahmins revived idolatry. The \"zameendars\", being preoccupied in business, had little time for affairs of \"Sabha\", and flame of \"Sabha\" was almost extinguished.\n\nOn 6 October 1839 Debendranath Tagore, son of (Prince) Dwarkanath Tagore, established \"Tattvaranjini Sabha\" which was shortly thereafter renamed the Tattwabodhini (\"Truth-seekers\") Sabha. Initially confined to immediate members of the Tagore family, in 2 years it mustered over 500 members. In 1840 Debendranath published a Bangla translation of \"Katha Upanishad\". A modern researcher describes the Sabha's philosophy as \"modern middle-class (bourgeois) Vedanta. Among its first members were the \"two giants of Hindu reformation and Bengal Renaissance, Akshay Kumar Datta \"who in 1839 emerged from the life of an anonymous squalor-beset individual\" and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar the \"indigenous modernizer\".\n\nOn 7th Pous 1765 Shaka (1843) Debendranath Tagore and twenty other Tattwabodhini stalwarts were formally invited by Pt. Vidyabagish into the Trust of Brahmo Sabha. The Pous Mela at Santiniketan starts on this day. From this day forth, the Tattwabodhini Sabha dedicated itself to promoting Ram Mohan Roy's creed. The other Brahmins who swore the First Covenant of Brahmoism are:-\n\nIn Nov 1855 the Rev. Charles Dall (a Unitarian minister of Boston) arrived in Calcutta to start his mission and immediately established contact with Debendranath and other Brahmos. Debendranath's suspicion of foreigners alienated Dall and in 1857, Debendranath Tagore barred the entry of the Reverend from the Sabha premises for preaching \"the name of Christ who some people worship as God\" within. Debendranath then proceeded on spiritual retreat to Simla. Dall, immediately formed a counter group \"The friends of Rammmohun Roy Society\" and then got admitted a protégé to Sabha. The presence of Dall's protégé Keshub Chandra Sen (a non-Brahmin) into the Calcutta Brahmo Sabha in 1857 while Debendranath was away in Simla caused considerable stress in the movement, with many long time Tattvabodhini Brahmin members publicly leaving the Brahmo Sabha and institutions due to his high-handed ways. In September 1858, Debendranath returned to Calcutta to resolve the simmering disputes. but his conservative mien did not allow him to take decisive steps. He proceeded on a sea voyage to Ceylon accompanied by Sen and his 2nd son Satyendranath (a firm admirer of Mr Sen) but no concord was achieved. In 1859, the venerable and beloved Secretary of the Tattwabodhini Sabha Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar resigned from the Brahmo Sabha in the face of Debendranath's vacillation. A meeting of the Tatwabodhini was promptly summoned with Debendranath resigning from the group he had founded. His third son Hemendranath Tagore then a boy barely 15 years in age, and the favorite pupil of Vidyasgar, was commonly acclaimed as Debendranath's successor to head the Tattwabodhini. In the course of time he would become known as the \"MahaAcharya\" (or \"Great Teacher\").\n\nDisgusted by politics within the Tagore family and the support to K. C. Sen's faction by his own brother Satyendranath Tagore, Hemendranath took the bold decisions to expand his Sabha out from Calcutta. His close associate Pandit Nobin Chandra Roy who had joined the new institution of \"Railways\" in 1860 as its \"Paymaster\" for Upper India was tasked to spread Brahmoism there. With a predominantly monotheistic populace following Islam and Sikhism it was perceived as fertile soil for Rammohun's message. The Tattwabodhini decreed that the uncorrupted faith of the original 1830 Trust Deed would be known there as the Adi Dharm to distinguish it from the distorted versions of the squabbling factions of Calcutta. The steps taken by Hemendranath Tagore, with the blessing of his father, was to institute in 1860 a suit before the Supreme Court to restore the title \"Brahmo Samaj\" to his faction. After losing in this suit in 1861, Keshub Sen's faction altered the name of their Samaj from \"The Brahmo Samaj of India\" to \"Navabidhan (or the New Dispensation)\". With victory in this suit and the promulgation of his \"Brahmo Anusthan\" (Code of Brahmaic doctrine and practice) in 1861, Hemendranath's Samaj-ists are henceforth known as the \"Anusthanic\" Brahmos (or Brahmos who follow the Code). The other factions were designated as \"\"An\"anusthanic\" Brahmos (or those who do not follow the Code) (this distinction was again to be legally examined before the Privy Council of Great Britain in 1901 and in 1902 the Privy Council upheld the 1897 finding of the Chief Court of the Punjab that the Adi Dharm (\"anusthanic\" Brahmos) were definitely not Hindus whereas the \"Ananusthanics\" Brahmos of Calcutta fall within Hinduism).\n\nIn 1861 the Brahmo \"Somaj\" (as it was spelled then) was founded at Lahore by Nobin Roy. It included many Bengalis from the Lahore Bar Association. Many branches were opened in the Punjab, at Quetta, Rawalpindi, Amritsar etc.\n\nDisagreement with the Tattvabodhini came to a head publicly between the period of 1 August 1865 till November 1866 with many tiny splinter groups styling themselves as \"Brahmo\". The most notable of these groups styled itself \"Brahmo Samaj of India\". This period is also referred to in the histories of the secessionists as the \"First Schism\".\n\nSwami Vivekananda was influenced by the Brahmo Samaj of India, and visited the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his youth.\n\nWhile the various Calcutta sponsored movements declined after 1920 and faded into obscurity after the Partition of India, the Adi Dharm creed has expanded and is now the 9th largest of India's enumerated religions with 7.83 million adherents, heavily concentrated between the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. In the Indian census of 2001 only 177 persons declared themselves a \"Brahmo\", but the number of subscriber members to Brahmo Samaj is somewhat larger at around 20,000 members.\n\nIn all fields of social reform, including abolition of the caste system and of the dowry system, emancipation of women, and improving the educational system, the \"Brahmo Samaj\" reflected the ideologies of the Bengal Renaissance. Brahmoism, as a means of discussing the dowry system, was a central theme of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's noted 1914 Bengali language novella, \"Parineeta\".\n\nIn 1866, Keshub Chandra Sen organised the more radical \"Brahmo Samaj of India\" with overtones of Christianity. He campaigned for the education of women and against child marriages. But he nonetheless arranged a marriage for his own underage daughter. The \"Brahmo Samaj of India\" split after this act of underage marriage generated a controversy and his pro-British utterances and leaning towards Christian rites generated more controversies. A third group, \"Sadharan (ordinary) Brahmo Samaj\", was formed in 1878. It gradually reverted to the teaching of the Upanishads but continued the work of social reform. The movement, always an elite group without significant popular following, lost force in the 20th century.\n\nAfter the controversy of underage marriage of Keshub Chunder Sen's daughter, the \"Special Marriages Act of 1872\" was enacted to set the minimum age of 14 years for marriage of girls. All Brahmo marriages were thereafter solemnised under this law. Many Indians resented the requirement of the affirmation \"I am not Hindu, nor a Mussalman, nor a Christian\" for solemnising a marriage under this Act. The requirement of this declaration was imposed by Henry James Sumner Maine, legal member of Governor General's Council appointed by Britain. The 1872 Act was repealed by the Special Marriage Act, 1954 under which any person of any religion could marry. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 applies to all Hindus including followers of the Brahmo Samaj. In India the statutory minimum age of marriage for followers of Brahmo Samaj is the same as for all Indians, viz., 21 years for males and 18 years for females. It is also the age of marriage in Bangladesh.\n\nIt also supported social reform movements of people not directly attached to the \"Samaj\", such as Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar’s movement which promoted widow remarriage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1397857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1397857", "title": "Coincidence", "text": "Coincidence\n\nA coincidence is a remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances that have no apparent causal connection with one another. \nThe perception of remarkable coincidences may lead to supernatural, occult, or paranormal claims. Or it may lead to belief in fatalism, which is a doctrine that events will happen in the exact manner of a predetermined plan.\n\nFrom a statistical perspective, coincidences are inevitable and often less remarkable than they may appear intuitively. An example is the birthday problem, which shows that the probability of two persons having the same birthday already exceeds 50% in a group of only 23 persons.\n\nThe first known usage of the word is from c. 1605 with the meaning \"exact correspondence in substance or nature\" from the French \"coincidence\", from \"coincider\", from Medieval Latin \"coincidere\". The definition evolved in the 1640s as \"occurrence or existence during the same time\", and again in the writings of Sir Thomas Browne as \"a concurrence of events with no apparent connection\" around the 1680s.\n\nSwiss psychiatrist Carl Jung developed a theory which states that remarkable coincidences occur because of what he called \"synchronicity,\" which he defined as an \"acausal connecting principle.\"\n\nOne of Kammerer's passions was collecting coincidences. He published a book titled \"Das Gesetz der Serie\" (\"The Law of Series\"), which has not been translated into English. In this book, he recounted 100 or so anecdotes of coincidences that had led him to formulate his theory of seriality.\n\nHe postulated that all events are connected by waves of seriality. Kammerer was known to make notes in public parks of how many people were passing by, how many of them carried umbrellas, etc. Albert Einstein called the idea of seriality \"interesting and by no means absurd.\" Carl Jung drew upon Kammerer's work in his book \"Synchronicity\".\n\nA coincidence lacks an apparent causal connection. A coincidence may be synchronicity, that being the experience of events that are causally unrelated, and yet their occurrence together has meaning for the person who observes them. To be counted as synchronicity, the events should be unlikely to occur together by chance, but this is questioned because there is usually a chance, no matter how small.\n\nSome skeptics (e.g., Georges Charpak and Henri Broch) argue synchronicity is merely an instance of apophenia. They argue that probability and statistical theory (exemplified, e.g., in Littlewood's law) suffice to explain remarkable coincidences.\n\nCharles Fort also compiled hundreds of accounts of interesting coincidences and anomalous phenomena.\n\nMeasuring the probability of a series of coincidences is the most common method of distinguishing a coincidence from causally connected events.\n\nTo establish cause and effect (i.e., causality) is notoriously difficult, as is expressed by the commonly heard statement that \"correlation does not imply causation.\" In statistics, it is generally accepted that observational studies can give hints but can never establish cause and effect. But, considering the probability paradox (see Koestler's quote above), it appears that the larger the set of coincidences, the more certainty increases and the more it appears that there is some cause behind a remarkable coincidence.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2189751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2189751", "title": "Cultural pluralism", "text": "Cultural pluralism\n\nCultural pluralism is a term used when smaller groups within a larger society maintain their unique cultural identities, and their values and practices are accepted by the wider culture provided they are consistent with the laws and values of the wider society. As a sociological term, the definition and description of cultural pluralism has evolved over time. It has been described as not only a fact but a societal goal. Cultural pluralism is distinct from (though often confused with) multiculturalism. Multiculturalism lacks the requirement of a dominant culture. If the dominant culture is weakened, societies can easily pass from cultural pluralism into multiculturalism without any intentional steps being taken by that society. If communities function separately from each other, or compete with one another, they are not considered culturally pluralistic.\n\nCultural pluralism can be practiced at varying degrees by a group or an individual. A prominent example of pluralism is 20th Century United States, in which a dominant culture with strong elements of nationalism, a sporting culture, and an artistic culture contained also smaller groups with their own ethnic, religious, and cultural norms . In 1971, the Canadian government referred to cultural pluralism, as opposed to multiculturalism, as the \"very essence\" of their nation's identity In a pluralist culture, groups not only co-exist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture. Pluralistic societies place strong expectations of integration on members, rather than expectations of assimilation. The existence of such institutions and practices is possible if the cultural communities are accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture and sometimes require the protection of the law. Often the acceptance of a culture may require that the new or minority culture remove some aspects of their culture which is incompatible with the laws or values of the dominant culture.\n\nThe idea of cultural pluralism in the United States has its roots in the transcendentalist movement and was developed by pragmatist philosophers such as Horace Kallen, William James and John Dewey, and later thinkers such as Randolph Bourne. One of the most famous articulations of cultural pluralistic ideas can be found in Bourne's 1916 essay \"Trans-National America\". Philosopher Horace Kallen is widely credited as being the originator of the concept of cultural pluralism. Kallen's 1915 essay in The Nation, \"Democracy versus the Melting Pot\", was written as an argument against the concept of the \"Americanization\" of European immigrants. He later coined the term cultural pluralism in 1924 when he published \"Culture and Democracy in the United States\". In 1976, the concept was further explored in Crawford Young's book \"The Politics of Cultural Pluralism\". Young's work, in African studies, emphasizes the flexibility of the definition of cultural pluralism within a society. More recent advocates include moral and cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder. In 1976, an article in the \"Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare\" offered a redefinition of cultural pluralism in which it is described as a social condition in which communities of different cultures live together and function in an open system.\n"}

{"id": "48544350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48544350", "title": "Enduro/X", "text": "Enduro/X\n\nEnduro/X is an open-source middleware platform for distributed transaction processing. It is built on proven APIs such as X/Open group's XATMI and XA. The platform is designed for building real-time microservices based applications with a clusterization option. Enduro/X functions as an extended drop-in replacement for Oracle (R) Tuxedo (R). The platform uses in-memory POSIX Kernel queues which insures high interprocess communication throughput.\n\nThe platform allows runtime system patching, without service interruption. The system monitors running processes, and restarts them after a crash or hang. System configuration can be dynamically reloaded and it provides a cluster facility, allowing two or more instances to be joined in peer-to-peer manner. Enduro/X is written in C and provides native APIs for C/C++.\n\nCurrently Enduro/X works on Linux kernels starting from 2.6.12. The most critical Linux feature is epoll() on POSIX queues. This Linux functionality provides the mechanism for one queue - multiple servers, where Enduro/X servers are polling over the queues. Enduro/X developers pushed the EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag inclusion into Linux kernel mainline (starting from version 4.5). The patch improved the Enduro/X response in case if hundreds of executables are providing the same service. Particularly kernel is not doing thundering herd type behavior anymore by waking up all binaries waiting on queue. Now only single receiver of the service call is woken. In some workloads the Enduro/X applications gets significant boost. The test case for the patch increased the performance of the workload from the 860 seconds to 24 sec.\n\nStarting with Enduro/X version 3.1.2 production grade support for FreeBSD, IBM AIX (versions 6.1 and 7.1) and Oracle Solaris V11 is added. V3.1.2 introduced experimental support for Apple macOS and Cygwin. Under Unix platforms where Posix queues are available, they are employed so that for every ATMI server/service pair there is separate queue open and caller service chooses queue in round robin mode. As for macOS there is no support for Posix queues in operating system, Enduro/X uses emulated Posix queues which are based on memory mapped files in tandem with Posix thread's process shared mutexes. For FreeBSD Posix queues can be polled too, thus Enduro/X on FreeBSD works in the say way as Linux with one queue-multiple servers. The polling on FreeBSD is done with help of kqueue.\n\n\nSeveral benchmarks have been made with the Enduro/X middleware and it shows that it competes with Oracle Tuxedo and ZeroMQ quite well. Enduro/X was faster than Tuxedo 30% in 56 KB data block range. Enduro/X was significantly faster than ZeroMQ in 10-20KB range. Also for test performed with RabbitMQ Enduro/X showed it's strength and was ahead of the competitor. For the RPC calls, Enduro/X was several times ahead, for send only calls, RabbitMQ was bit closer to Enduro/X.\n\nEnduro/X contains different sub-modules which extends the application server and middleware functionality.\n\nEnduro/X provides a queuing subsystem called TMQ (Transactional Message Queue). This facility provides persistent queues that allows applications to explicitly enqueue and dequeue messages from named queues. Queues can be ordered by message en-queue time in LIFO or FIFO order. Queues are managed by an XA compliant resource manager allowing queue operations to participate in distributed transactions. An automated queue forwarding feature is provided that will remove entries from a queue and invoke an associated Enduro/X ATMI services, placing the reply message on an associated reply queue and failed messages to failure queue.\n\nEnduro/X offers applications to use ini file based configuration reading via special XATMI server, provided in package, named \"cconfsrv\". Basically via standard tpcall() user application is able to read configuration files (can be separate ini file or folder with them). Technique allows to use the sub-sections with key/value inheritance from main section.\n\nEnduro/X introduced new set of API function named tplog. This allows user to use the same C based high-performance debug logging facilities which Enduro/X uses internally. It is possible to redirect all logging by thread bases files. Also there are APIs for \"request logging\", which means that user and Enduro/X can do logging in separate files for each request (e.g. log by session id, log by username, etc.)\n\nASG is bindings project on top of the Enduro/X. Authors considers these binding as application server for go, because Golang projects are linked statically and by default there is no such thing as components. Enduro/X allows to run separate executable binaries, which represents stateless services. These services can be reloaded on the fly without service interruption. Also platform allows to run distributed transaction processing by using Golang. Developers provides modified Oracle DB OCI8 drivers for Go, which supports XA transactions. Enduro/X ASG provides first ever distributed transaction facility for Golang.\n\nFull client bindings are available for PHP5. Client PHP processes might compile a loadable module or compile the Enduro/X process inside the PHP. When PHP process is running as client, it must be present in Enduro/X Application environment, that could be done when application is hosted under the same user where PHP app runs (Apache or so) or for the PHP user creating a micro environment which further connects to main application server via tpbridge process. Module is available here .\n\nClient and server bindings are available for Perl scripting language. Perl module is available here .\n\nThe Enduro/X was acquired from ATR Baltic, Ltd by Mavimax Ltd on February, 2017 with full rights to the source code and current agreements.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46433", "title": "Fun", "text": "Fun\n\nFun is the enjoyment of pleasure, particularly in leisure activities. Fun is an experience often unexpected, informal or purposeless. It is an enjoyable distraction, diverting the mind and body from any serious task or contributing an extra dimension to it. Although particularly associated with recreation and play, fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and even seemingly mundane activities of daily living. It may often have little to no logical basis, and opinions on whether an activity is fun may differ from person to person. A distinction between enjoyment and fun is difficult but possible to articulate, fun being a more spontaneous, playful, or active event. There are psychological and physiological implications to the experience of fun.\n\nThe word \"fun\" is associated with sports, sex, entertaining media, high merriment, and amusement. Although its etymology is uncertain, it may be derived from \"fonne\" (fool) and \"fonnen\" (the one fooling the other). Its meaning in 1727 was \"cheat, trick, hoax\", a meaning still retained in the phrase \"to make fun of\".\n\nThe way the word \"fun\" is used demonstrates its distinctive elusiveness and happiness. Expressions such as \"Have fun!\" and \"That was fun!\" indicate that fun is pleasant, personal, and to some extent unpredictable. Expressions such as \"I was making fun of myself\" convey the sense that fun is something that can be amusing and not to be taken seriously. The adjective \"funny\" has two meanings which often need to be clarified between a speaker and listener. One meaning is \"amusing, jocular, droll\" and the other meaning is \"odd, quirky, peculiar\". These differences indicate the evanescent and experiential nature of fun and the difficulty of distinguishing \"fun\" from \"enjoyment\".\n\nFun's evanescence can be seen when an activity regarded as fun becomes goal-oriented. Many physical activities and individual sports are regarded as fun until the participant seeks to win a competition, at which point, much of the fun may disappear as the individual's focus tightens. Surfing is an example. If you are a \"mellow soul\" (not in a competition or engaging in extreme sport) \"once you're riding waves, you're guaranteed to be having ... fun\".\n\nThe pleasure of fun can be seen by the numerous efforts to harness its positive associations. For example, there are many books on serious subjects, about skills such as music, mathematics and languages, normally quite difficult to master, which have \"fun\" added to the title.\n\nMany physical activities provide opportunities to play and have fun. Not only can these activities be fun but can also improve physical and mental states.\n\nAccording to Johan Huizinga, fun is \"an absolutely primary category of life, familiar to everybody at a glance right down to the animal level.\" Psychological studies reveal both the importance of fun and its effect on the perception of time, which is sometimes said to be shortened when one is having fun. As the adage states: \"Time flies when you're having fun\".\n\nIt has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a \"chunked pattern\": \"We rarely look at the real world\", according to game designer Raph Koster, \"we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. [...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be\". Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a \"social lubricant\", important in adding \"to one's pleasure in life\" and helping to \"act as a buffer against stress\".\n\nFor children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play \"involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to never-never land and enjoy it.\"\n\nSome scientists have identified areas of the brain associated with the perception of novelty, which are stimulated when faced with \"unusual or surprising circumstances\". Information is initially received in the hippocampus, the site of long-term memory consolidation, where the brain attempts to match the new information with recognizable patterns stored in long-term memory. When it is unable to do this, the brain releases dopamine, a chemical which stimulates the amygdala, the site of emotion, and creates a pleasurable feeling that is associated with the new memory. In other words, fun is created by stimulating the brain with novelty.\n\nIn the modern world, fun is sold as a consumer product in the form of games, novelties, television, toys and other amusements. Marxist sociologists such as the Frankfurt School criticise mass-manufactured fun as too calculated and empty to be fully satisfying. Bill Griffith satirises this dysphoria when his cartoon character Zippy the Pinhead asks mechanically, \"Are we having fun yet?\" In the Beatles song \"She's Leaving Home\" fun is called \"the one thing that money can't buy.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34961397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34961397", "title": "Gabriel Cousens", "text": "Gabriel Cousens\n\nGabriel Kenneth Cousens (born May 14, 1943) is an American physician M.D., homeopath, and spiritual writer who practices holistic medicine. In 1976 Cousens legally changed his name from Kenneth Gabriel Cousens to Gabriel Kenneth Cousens. Cousens advocates live foods therapy, a nutritional regimen which he says can cure diabetes, depression and other chronic degenerative diseases. He is the founder of the \"Essene Order of Light\", a spiritual organization based upon teachings from the Jewish Kabbalah, the Torah, and modern interpretations of the Essenes. The Essenes are a mystical group from the second century B.C.E. who lived in community, eschewed materialism and grew their own food. The modern Essene movement was founded by Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, a religious scholar who promoted a simple holistic lifestyle of meditation and raw vegan eating and published several books on the Essenes in the early 20th century. Essene Order of Light is taught by Cousens at \"Tree of Life Foundation\", an organization directed by Cousens and headquartered at its \"Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center\" in Patagonia, Arizona. Cousens has authored nine books and tours internationally promoting his ideas on food and his spiritual beliefs.\n\nCousens grew up in Highland Park, Illinois. As a freshman at Amherst College, he designed a heart lung machine and spent two summers doing leukemia research. He graduated from Amherst College in 1965 with a B.A. in biology, where he was a football lineman/guard/middle linebacker and co-captain of the 1964 football team. That year he received a National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete Award. He earned his medical degree from Columbia Medical School in 1969, and he completed his residency in psychiatry in 1973.\n\nCousens says he switched to a vegetarian diet around age 30, after which he began teaching meditation. In 1974 he went to India to study with the swami Muktananda (1908-1982), staying for seven years. He returned to the United States in 1981 and studied Kabbalah and the Essenes, becoming ordained in 1988.\n\nCousens founded the Essene Order of Light in 1992, and the following year he established the Tree of Life Foundation as a federal tax-exempt religious organization. The Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center, located in Patagonia, Arizona, was founded in 1994 as a health retreat which offers raw food education, fasting, and nutrition. Cousens is an ordained Rabbi and offers workshops on spiritual Judaism. His newest book, \"Torah as a Guide to Enlightenment\", published through North Atlantic Books, is a commentary on the Torah from a Kabbalistic perspective. Cousens founded a not for profit organization called the Essene Order of Light which teaches \"modern Essene living\". He outlined his philosophy in his book \"Creating Peace By Being Peace\".\n\nCousens has advocated a nutritionally based raw food diet for babies and children. He instituted a study of the medical history of infants and children and advocates for raw food education. A 2009 documentary, \"Simply Raw\", followed six people with diabetes who go through a thirty-day raw vegan program in an attempt to cure their disease with a raw food diet and without drugs. Surgeon and alternative medicine critic David Gorski said that Cousens and the film both grossly misrepresented the modern medical approach to diabetes. Gorski described Cousens works as promoting vitalism and other discredited principles.\n\nIn 1994, California revoked his license to practice for \"excessive prescribing\", but based on a form of plea bargain this revocation was stayed for three years probation. In consequence of the California decision, New York also required him to return his license. Cousens' license in California was later reinstated, but not in New York. Because of this, he is not eligible for a medical license in Arizona.\n\nIn 1998, 57-year-old Charles Levy of New Jersey died after being treated at the center over a five-day period. The cause of death was determined by the Santa Cruz County Medical Examiner, who along with the Arizona Medical Board attributed the death to a gas gangrene infection caused by \"bovine adrenal fluid\" injections given by Cousens as part of a treatment for fatigue. The autopsy also found that Levy had hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, and coronary atherosclerosis. Levy's son said that his father was healthy, able to run three miles, not overweight, and had no high blood pressure at the time of his visit to the spa, and the family sued for malpractice. Cousens settled the suit for an undisclosed amount paid to the family. The case came up before the Arizona Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners in 2001. Despite the medical examiner's report and testimony, then Board Chairman Bruce Shelton said he \"found no medical fault with Dr. Cousens' care of\" Levy and the board found \"no violation of homeopathic law\" in Cousens' treatment. Cousens argued that the medical examiner had misdiagnosed the cause of death, which he said was toxic shock unrelated to the injections, a claim that the Levy family attorney called \"outrageous\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38103199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38103199", "title": "Gabriel Wagner", "text": "Gabriel Wagner\n\nGabriel Wagner (c. 1660 – c. 1717) was a radical German philosopher and materialist who wrote under the nom-de-plume Realis de Vienna. A follower of Spinoza and acquaintance of Leibniz, Wagner did not believe that the universe or bible were divine creations, and sought to extricate philosophy and science from the influence of theology. Wagner also held radical political views critical of the nobility and monarchy. After failing to establish lasting careers in cities throughout German-speaking Europe, Wagner died in or shortly after 1717.\n\nWagner studied under scholar Christian Thomasius in Leipzig, and in 1691 published a philosophical tract critical of Thomasius, \"Discourse and doubts in Christ: a Thomasian introduction to courtly philosophy.\" The tract satirically dubbed Thomasius the \"German Socrates\" and attracted attention within philosophical circles, including from Leibniz, who sought to contact Wagner. In the same year, after a dispute over rent, Wagner was expelled from university and imprisoned. Following his release, Wagner traveled in 1693 to Halle, where as a result of his increasingly libertine views he wholly broke with Thomasius, who by contrast was becoming more conservative. Moving to Berlin later in 1693 and then to Vienna, Wagner was in 1696 given a temporary position in Hamburg, which he lost due to his novel and sometimes polemical philosophical positions.\n\nReceiving support from Leibniz, Wagner worked for a time at the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel; and maintained his contact with Leibniz. Leibniz wrote to Wagner in 1696, describing his admiration for Aristotle and opposing contemporary attacks on him, despite his view that Aristotle had discovered only a small portion of the discipline.\n\nOpposing his former mentor Thomasius' belief in the soul, Wagner published another text in 1707, \"Critique of Thomasian views on the nature of the soul.\" Theologian Johann Joachim Lange accused Wagner of Spinozist sympathies in 1710, and Wagner replied to these criticisms in the same year.\n\nThe last record of Wagner is found in Göttingen in 1717, where he came into conflict with historian of philosophy Christoph August Heumann. Wagner presumably died shortly thereafter.\n\nWagner believed that both education and philosophy should be modernized and focus on mathematics, physics and medicine, but not theology. In this regard he held that Germany had made more progress, while French, Italian and Spanish thinkers were overly influenced by followers of Aristotle, Galen and Ptolemy. Believing in intellectual freedom, Wagner was an admirer of German philosopher and professor Nicolaus Hieronymus Gundling, who favored \"atheistic\" classical Greek philosophy.\n\nAs articulated in his 1707 critique of Thomasius, Wagner did not believe in a soul, in divine providence, in the divinity of the bible, or in divine creation. He instead advocated reason, the most \"godly\" aspect of humankind, as a means of eradicating superstition. Wagner therefore celebrated advances in science facilitated by Descartes and even considered himself a Cartesian, though he disagreed with the latter's Christian metaphysical beliefs and even sought to undermine them. Deeply influenced by Spinoza, Wagner placed even greater emphasis on the importance of experimentation and empiricism in developing knowledge.\n\nWagner held radical political beliefs, advocating a restructuring of society according to more egalitarian principles and advocating greater emphasis on administration, education and culture. Reform of educational institutions was a particular concern of his writing. Wagner contested that aristocracy by birth was inferior to intellectual achievement. He also believed that Germany's fragmentary political system resulted in a weak and mismanaged government. In these beliefs Wagner was influenced by but disagreed with political thinkers such as Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes and Niccolò Machiavelli. Much of Wagner's political and philosophical system was oriented, ultimately, towards securing religious, intellectual, and personal freedom, a project of the Enlightenment as a whole.\n\nWagner is known for his longstanding correspondence with Leibniz, and his erudition and innovative understanding of philosophy and natural sciences during his time, according to historian Cornelio Fabro.\n\nHistorian Jonathan Israel writes that Wagner is an important materialist philosopher of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and an example of both radical philosophy and atheism produced by the growing university system of the period. Historian Frederick Beiser writes that Wagner and his fellow materialists in Germany, though they were less numerous than those found in France and England, developed mechanistic explanations for human behavior and raised fears of spreading religious skepticism.\n\n\n"}

J. Paton, was a Scottish philosopher who taught at various university institutions, including Glasgow and Oxford. He worked in British intelligence during the two world wars and played a diplomatic role on behalf of Poland at the 1919 Versailles conference. In 1968, the year before his death, he published \"The Claim of Scotland\", a plea for greater general understanding of the constitutional position of his own native country.\n\nPaton was born in Abernethy. He was the son of the Reverend William Macalister Paton and Jean Robertson Millar. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow, the University of Glasgow, and Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford he gained a First in Classical Moderations, 1909, and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats', a combination of philosophy and ancient history) in 1911.\n\nDuring the First World War Paton served in the Admiralty's Intelligence Division, 1914–1919, and became an expert on Polish affairs in which capacity he attended the Versailles conference in 1919. At the Peace Conference he was the brains behind the Curzon Line. Drawn across eastern Poland, the line marked to the west of it what Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, would guarantee as Poland for the Poles. It was breached by the German-Russian Steel Pact of 28 September 1939, that prevented Russians from assisting Poland.\n\nDuring the Second World War Paton did government work in the Foreign Research and Press Service (after 1943 the Foreign Office Research Department), 1939–44. He was also a member of the Executive Committee of the League of Nations Union, 1939–48.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1927 Paton was Fellow and Praelector in Classics and Philosophy at Queen's College, and Dean of the College, 1917–22. In 1920 he served as Junior Proctor at Oxford. He spent a sabbtical year in the United States of America, 1926-26, where he was Laura Spelman Rockefeller Research Fellow, University of California. There he wrote his first philosophy book, \"The Good Will\". The year after his return to Oxford he resigned his Queen's Fellowship to take up the post of Professor of Logic and Rhetoric at the University of Glasgow, 1927–37. He returned to Oxford as White's Professor of Moral Philosophy (1937–52), a post which carried with it a Fellowship at Corpus Christi College.\n\nPaton was a notable Kantian scholar; in this he abandoned his earlier attraction to the idealist philosophy of Benedetto Croce (1866-1952). His works of Kantian commentary included \"Kant's Metaphysics of Experience\" (1936), \"The Categorical Imperative\" (1947), and \"The Moral Law\" (a translation of Kant's \"Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten\" [Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals], 1785] (1947). Paton delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews, 1949–50; the lectures were published as \"The Modern Predicament\" (1955).\n\nIn his final years Paton published \"The Claim of Scotland\" (1968), a considered dissection of national sensitivities between Scotland and England under the Treaty of Union, in which he articulated a robust yet peaceable call for greater general understanding of Scotland's sovereign rights. The book cites in particular the period in the early 1950s when parliament in London effectively ignored the Scottish Covenant of 1949.\n\nPaton married twice, the first time in 1936 to Mary Sheila (d. 1959), daughter of Henry Paul Todd-Naylor. His second marriage was with Sarah Irene (d. 1964), daughter of Professor William Macneile Dixon. He died on August 2, 1969 in Perth and Kinross.\n\nA short philosophical autobiography appears in 'Fifty Years of Philosophy',\"Contemporary British Philosophy, Third Series\", ed. H.D.

Illinois, was a United States Supreme Court case on antitrust law which established that indirect purchasers of goods or services along a supply chain cannot seek remedy for antitrust actions committed by the manufacturer or service provider, leaving this option only reserved for direct purchasers. The decision in this case has become known as the \"Illinois Brick doctrine\" used to determine who has Article III standing to bring antitrust charges against companies.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the United States government filed both civil and criminal charges against eleven concrete brick manufacturers in Chicago, stating that they were engaging in price fixing. The defendants pleaded \"nolo contendere\" and entered into a settlement with the government. \n\nSpurred by this, the government of Illinois filed a new suit at the eleven concrete brick manufacturers, asserting they were engaged in conspiratorial price-fixing for bricks to be used for government construction, violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, and seeking treble damage. The defendants sought to have the case dismissed as the government were not direct purchasers of the bricks. In general, these companies sold bricks directly to masonry contractors for them to complete jobs given to them by general contractors during the construction of new buildings; the defendants stated that the government, in paying for the construction of these buildings, were not the ones purchasing the bricks themselves. The district court agreed, citing both the Supreme Court ruling of \"Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.\" () that emphasized that direct purchases of goods have the right to sue manufacturers for anti-trust, and the Seventh Circuit's decision in \"Commonwealth Edison v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.\" (315 F.2d 564, 567) that determined that the ultimate consumers of goods along a supply chain were \"too remote and [in]consequential to provide legal standing to sue against the alleged antitrust violator\". \n\nThe state appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which overturned the district court's ruling, arguing that the Sherman Act allows for any person that was harmed by antitrust behaviors may bring suit for triple damages. (536 F.2d 1163). The brick manufacturers petitioned to the Supreme Court for writ of certorari, which was granted. Oral arguments were heard on March 23, 1977 with the decision given on June 9, 1977.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, The Supreme Court held that indirect victims of a price fixing conspiracy had no standing to sue for antitrust violations for raised prices. The majority opinion was written by Justice Byron White, joined by Justices Warren Burger, Potter Stewart, Lewis Powell, William Rehnquist, and John Paul Stevens. It held that if an indirect purchaser of overpriced goods could sue, then it would open the door to “multiple recovery”. An overcharge might be collected if more than one entity in the chain of distribution of the product could recover for the same violation. White was concerned with the Court making a significant overrule to their previous decision in \"Hanover Shoe\".\n\nJustice William Brennan wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun. Brennan wrote that the majority's approach to stay consistent with \"Hanover Shoe\" undercut the strength of the language that Congress had written into the Sherman Act. Justice Blackmun also wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing the case's close timing with \"Hanover\" likely impacted the result; if \"Hanover\" had not been decided, the courts would have likely ruled in favor of the state government.\n\nTwo exceptions to the direct purchaser rule are potentially recognized in various jurisdictions: the control exception and the preexisting cost-plus contract exception.\n\nThe control exception, noted in footnote 16 of the Illinois Brick opinion, states that in some situations an indirect purchaser might maintain an antitrust action where the direct purchases is owned or controlled by its customer. This exception is narrowly construed and limited to situations where the relationship involves a functional or economic unity between the direct and indirect purchaser such that there has been effectively one sale. See Jewish Hospital Association v. Stewart Mechanical Enterprise, Inc., 628 F.2d 971 (6th Cir. 1980).\n\nThe preexisting cost-plus contract exception states that an indirect purchaser may have standing where the all costs initially borne by the direct purchaser are passed on to the indirect purchaser pursuant to a preexisting cost-plus contract between the parties. In such situation, the overcharging is not absorbed by the direct purchaser but is instead passed on to the indirect purchaser. See Illinois v. Panhandle E. Pipe Line Co. 852 F.2d 891 (7th Cir 1988).\n\nMany state antitrust laws reject the \"Illinois Brick\" doctrine. Thus, in \"California v. ARC America Corp.\", the Supreme Court rejected arguments that \"Illinois Brick\" preempted broader state antitrust laws such as that of California, which rejected the doctrine.\n\nA 2007 Antitrust Modernization Commission Report proposed that Congress should abandon the \"Illinois Brick\" doctrine. The proposal, if adopted, would weaken the federal right of action for direct purchasers by reviving as a defense the fact that the direct purchaser had passed on the overcharge instead of absorbing it, while creating a federal right of action for indirect purchasers. Federal rights of action under the proposal would not be exclusive, but state law claims would be subject to expanded federal jurisdiction to allow consolidation of all claims from a price fix in a single court for both discovery and trial. All recoveries in the consolidated actions would be limited to the initial overcharge, trebled.\n\nThe applicability of \"Illinios Brick\" towards digital marketplaces is expected to be the subject of the pending Supreme Court case, \"Apple Inc. v. Pepper\", to be heard in the 2018 term, which relates to whether consumers of third-party mobile applications through a marketplace can bring anti-trust actions against the owner of the marketplace.\n\n\n"}

His parents were probably of Greek origin, but they were born in Wallachia.\n\nHe began his education in private schools, probably French, and achieved his formation in France, at the University of Paris and later in Germany, at the University of Berlin. He obtained the title of doctor of philosophy at this later university, in 1848, with a dissertation on Kant's philosophy.\n\nZalomit began teaching philosophy at the Saint Sava Academy. When the University of Bucharest was established, in 1864, he was appointed Professor of philosophy at the Faculty of Letters. He held the office of rector of the university between May 1871 - April 1885. In 1882 he became a member of the \"Permanent Council of Public Instruction\", and in 1885 he was elected vice-president of this institution.\n\nLike other translators, Zalomit contributed to the creation of a modern Romanian philosophical terminology and to the diffusion of philosophical ideas in the Romanian society. The textbook of Antoine Charma (1801–1869) that he translated introduced in Romania the eclecticism of Victor Cousin, whose disciple Charma was. This work proposed the following disciplinary division of the philosophy: psychology, logic, morals, theodicy and history of philosophy. By means of the translation of Charma's handbook, Zalomit introduces for the first time in Romania the history of philosophy as a philosophical discipline.\n\nHis dissertation from 1848 is the first exegesis of Kant's philosophy written by a Romanian. Although the Kantianism was at that time known to Romanians from different courses and textbooks (of Daniil Philippidis, Gheorghe Lazăr, Eufrosin Poteca, Eftimie Murgu, August Treboniu Laurian, Simeon Bărnuţiu, and of course that of Zalomit himself), there were still no monographs on this subject. Zalomit places Kant in the historical context of the modern philosophy, presenting the main figures of the empiricist and rationalist traditions. He considers that Kant is a spiritual successor of Descartes, and that he accomplished the program set forth, but unrealised, by Descartes.\n\nIoan Zalomit offers in his dissertation a criticism of Kant, on several topics. For example, he criticises the epistemological preeminence that Kant assigns to the visual sense, arguing that touching has to be at least as important as seeing for the knowledge of the exterior world, since the category of substance is practically inseparable from this sense. He argues next that Kant did not critically analysed the three ideas of the pure reason, which, in his opinion, are nothing but distinct applications of the idea of infinite, or of Absolute, and can therefore be reduced to this idea. Next, he makes the point that, speaking of things-in-themselves, Kant crosses the limits of his own philosophy.\n\nZalomit considers that the greatest difficulty of Kant's philosophy is the distinction between nature and liberty. He thinks that this separation can not be maintained, and he argues that an identification of nature and liberty is not to be feared. The moral laws can not be harmed by this, because liberty is natural, it is inherent to the notion of nature. Thus, the moral precepts could be regarded as duties of the nature. By this naturalisation of the liberty Zalomit wanted to save the \"true harmony of the natural things\", the \"true organism of the Universe\", in order to save both human liberty and the validity of the concept of Divine Providence. This Christian and organicist conception testifies of the influence that the Eastern Orthodoxy had on his world-view, but also of his knowledge of Schelling's philosophy of nature.\n\n\n"}

Raven, was an English classical scholar, notable for his work on presocratic philosophy, and amateur botanist.\n\nJohn Raven was born on 13 December 1914 in Cambridge, the son of Charles Earle Raven, sometime Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge and Master of Christ's College, Cambridge and of Margaret Wollaston. His mother's family endowed Raven with a distinguished intellectual pedigree, including between 1723 and 1829 seven Fellows of the Royal Society (among them Charlton Wollaston, Francis Wollaston (1694-1774), Francis Wollaston (1762-1823), George Wollaston and William Hyde Wollaston); Raven was also a 7th generation descendant of William Wollaston, the philosophical writer. On his father's side, he was related to Samuel Hole, Dean of Rochester.\n\nRaven was educated at St Ronan's School, then situated at Worthing, before proceeding in September 1928 with a scholarship to Marlborough College, where he distinguished himself academically, winning prizes in English verse, Greek iambics, Greek and Latin prose and Latin verse, culminating in a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. He did not confine himself to the intellectual, playing in the First XV at rugby and setting new school records in 1934 for the high jump and 440 yards.\n\nFollowing the award of a first class degree in classics at Trinity Raven became in 1946 a research fellow there. In October 1948 he was elected a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, a position he held until his retirement in 1984.\n\nDuring the Second World War he was a conscientious objector, basing his case on arguments by Plato. He undertook unsalaried social work for Guy Clutton-Brock at Oxford House in Bethnal Green.\n\nAs a classical scholar, Raven's interests were in ancient philosophy. In 1957 he published with Geoffrey Kirk \"The Pre-Socratic philosophers\", a standard work for undergraduates still in use today. Raven contributed the chapters relating to the Italian tradition (Pythagoras of Samos, Alcmaeon of Croton, Pre-Parmenidean Pythagoreanism, Parmenides of Elea, Zeno of Elea, Melissus of Samos, Philolaus of Croton and Eurytus of Croton) and on Anaxagoras and Archelaus.\n\nAs Senior Tutor at King's in the 1960s he turned the college to the left, telling public schools that their boys could no longer expect to \"swan in\", as previously.\n\nRaven was the undergraduate tutor of Myles Burnyeat, who subsequently became the fifth Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at Cambridge University.\n\nWhile Raven's principal professional occupation was his career as a classical scholar, he applied a similar intellectual rigour to his amateur interest in botany.\nFrom the mid-1930s John Heslop-Harrison, Professor of Botany at King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne, had reported significant new plant discoveries on expeditions to the Inner and Outer Hebrides. The sheer scale of the discoveries aroused scepticism, and in 1948 Raven secured a grant from Trinity College to fund a trip to Harris and Rùm in July and August of that year to investigate the claims of Heslop-Harrison.\n\nRaven's conclusions about two of the notable species were published, briefly, in \"Nature\". He suggested that both \"Carex bicolor\" and \"Polycarpon tetraphyllum\" were introductions to Rùm, but did not comment on the possible means of introduction. His full report of the expedition and fraud was deposited in the library of King's College, Cambridge on 5 May 1960, to attack Prof. Jack Heslop-Harrison's electron microscope research into plant genetics (DNA) and only published in full in 1999 after the deaths of both Heslop-Harrison, his son Jack Heslop-Harrison and Raven himself. In the report Raven alleged that at some time in the 1940s Heslop Harrison transported alien plants to the Isle of Rum and planted them in the soil; he then \"discovered\" the plants, claimed they were indigenous to the area and that he was the first to find them. Raven's report to the council of Trinity College states: \"In the interests not only of truth but also of the reputation of British science it is essential somehow to discover what plants and what insects he (Heslop Harrison) has either completely fabricated or else deliberately introduced into the Hebrides.\"\n\nRaven's classical and botanical interests were brought together in four J. H. Gray Lectures given at Cambridge in 1976, published after his death as \"Plants and Plant Lore in Ancient Greece\".\n\nRaven married Constance Faith Alethea Hugh Smith; they had five children: Anna Raven, Andrew Raven, Hugh Raven, Sarah Raven and Jane Raven. On marriage in 1954 John and Faith Raven purchased Docwra's Manor in Shepreth, near Cambridge, where they cultivated a garden which is now open to the public.\n\nHe died on 5 March 1980 in Shepreth, near Cambridge, aged 65. Following his death a group of friends contributed to a collection of essays to commemorate his life, published in 1981 as \"John Raven by his Friends\".\n\n\n"}

According to UNESCO, the shrine is the oldest royal Confucian shrine preserved and the ritual ceremonies continue a tradition established in the 14th century. Such shrines existed during the Three Kingdoms of Korea period (57-668), but these have not survived. The Jongmyo Shrine was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.\n\nJongmyo is adjacent to Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung in the south. They used to be connected in the Joseon period, but were separated by a road built by Japanese colonialists. Nowadays there is a construction plan to recover the original structure of the shrine.\n\nThe main buildings of Jongmyo was constructed in October, 1394 when Taejo, first king of Joseon Dynasty, moved the capital to Seoul. It was destroyed by fire in the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), then rebuilt in 1608.\n\nWhen it was built in 1394 by order of King Taejo, the Jongmyo Shrine was thought to be one of the longest buildings in Asia, if not the longest. The main hall, known as \"Jeongjeon\", had seven rooms. Each room was reserved for a king and his queen. The complex was expanded by King Sejong (r. 1418–50) who ordered the construction of \"Yeongnyeongjeon\" (Hall of Eternal Comfort). This practice of expansion continued, with the growth of the complex moving from west to east, because of the need to house more memorial tablets during the reigns of later kings until there were a total of 19 rooms. However, during the Seven-Year War (1592–98), Japanese invaders burned down the original shrine and a new complex was constructed in 1601 and has survived to this day. The original tablets were saved in the invasion by hiding them in the house of a commoner and also survive. . A king's tablets were enshrined three years after his death. There are 19 memorial tablets of kings and 30 of their queens, placed in the 19 chambers. Each room is very simple and plain in design. Only two kings' memorial tablets are not enshrined here.. In addition to the tablet, there is a panel listing each king's accomplishments.\n\nThe current \"Jeongjeon\" is National treasure of Korea No. 227 and is the longest building in Korea of traditional design..\n\nViewed from the king's throne at Gyeongbokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine would have been on the king's left while the Sajik Shrine, another important Confucian shrine, was on the right. This arrangement was derived from Chinese practice. The main halls are surrounded by hills. In front of the main hall is the \"Woldae\" Courtyard, which is 150 meters in length and 100 meters in width.\n\nThe south entrance gate was reserved for spirits to enter and exit, the east gate was for the king, and the west gate was for the performers of the royal ritual..\n\nThe Jongmyo Shrine is divided into 15 main parts. \n\n\nAn elaborate performance of ancient court music (with accompanying dance) known as \"Jongmyo jeryeak\" (hangul: 종묘제례악; hanja: 宗廟祭禮樂) is performed there each year for the \"Jongmyo jerye\" ritual. Musicians, dancers, and scholars would perform Confucian rituals, such as the Jongmyo Daeje (Royal Shrine Ritual) in the courtyard five times a year. . Today the rituals have been reconstructed and revived. The Jongmyo Daeje has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 56 and is performed every year on the first Sunday in May. . The \"Jongmyo Jerye-ak\", the traditional court music of Joseon, is performed by the Royal Court Orchestra and has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property of South Korea No. 1.. This court music has its origins in Chinese court music that was brought to Korea during the Goryeo period (918-1392). . King Sejong composed new music for the ritual based largely on \"hyangak\" (with some \"dangak\") in 1447 and 1462. .\n\nThe songs invite the ancestral spirits to descend from heaven to enjoy the kings achievements in founding the dynasty and defending the country in order to encourage their descendants to follow in their footsteps.\n\nToday the members of the Jeonju Yi Royal Family Association perform the rites to the accompaniment of music and dance provided by musicians from the National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts and dancers from the Gukak National High School\n\nJongmyo entry is located 155 Jong-no, Jongno-gu.

{"id": "15122090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15122090", "title": "Marcosians", "text": "Marcosians\n\nThe Marcosians were a Gnostic sect founded by Marcus, active in Lyon, France and southern Europe from the second to the 4th century. Women held special status in the Marcosian communities; they were regarded as prophetesses and participated in administering the Eucharistic rites. Irenaeus accuses Marcus of seducing his followers, and scornfully writes (\"Adversus Haereses\" I. 13, 4) that the whole sect was an affair of \"silly women.\"\n\nThe Marcosian system was a variation of that of Valentinus. It retained the 30 Aeons, but called them \"Greatnesses\" and gave them numerical values. It kept the myth of the fall of Sophia but called it a \"Divine Deficiency\". Unique to it was the adaptation of the Pythagorean number theory (Isopsephy) to Gnosticism.\n\nMarcus holds his knowledge to be the product of a divine revelation of the body of the Anthropos:\n\nSometimes Marcus counts the number of letters in a name, sometimes he reckons up the sum total, when to each letter is given its value in the Greek arithmetical notation: sometimes he uses a method which enables him to find still deeper mysteries.\n\nMarcus points out that if we take a single letter, Δ, and write its name at full length, δέλτα, we get five letters; but we may write again the names of these at full length and get a number of letters more, and so on \"ad infinitum\". If the mysteries contained in a single letter be thus infinite, what must be the immensity of those contained in the name of the Propator.\n\nConcerning this name he gives the following account:—When the first Father, who is above thought and without substance, willed the unspeakable to become spoken, and the invisible to become formed, He opened His mouth and emitted a Word like Himself, which being the form of the invisible, declared to Himself what He was. His name consisted of four syllables successively uttered, of four, four, ten, and twelve letters respectively.\n\nIt might appear as if we were to understand as the first of these the word ἀρχή; and this name of four syllables and thirty letters seems to correspond to a description of the system of thirty Aeons divided into two Tetrads, a Decad, and a Dodecad. Each letter is one of the Aeons, and contains within itself an infinity of mysteries. Each letter makes its own sound, it knows not the sound of the adjacent letter, nor of the whole, but the restitution of all things will take place when all the letters are brought to make the same sound, and then a harmony will result of which we have an image in that made when we all sound the \"Amen\" together.\n\nThis comparison shows an interesting point of agreement in liturgical usage between the Gnostics of the 2nd century and the Roman church of the time of Jerome, whose well-known words are \"ad similitudinem caelestis tonitrui Amen reboat.\" What is stated about the limited knowledge of each Aeon may be compared with what Hippolytus of Rome tells of the Docetae (viii. 10).\n\nMarcus pushes into further details his designation of the Aeons as letters of the alphabet. There are twenty-four letters in the alphabet, and twenty-four is the sum of the letters of the names of the first tetrad: \n\nFollowed by those of the second tetrad:\n\n\nThese form the Ogdoad. Again, the Greek alphabet consists of nine mutes, eight semivowels, and seven vowels. The mutes belong to Father and Truth (The Unspeakable, and Silence, of course, do not count); these being mute reveal nothing to man. The semivowels belong to Word and Life, but the vowels to Man and Church, since it was a voice coming through Man which gave power to all.\n\nFor the seven heavens, we are told, utter each its own vowel sound, the first A and so on; and it was the sound of their united doxology borne to the earth, which gave generation to all things on the earth. By the descent of Him who was with the Father from the nine into the seven, the groups of Aeons were equalized and perfect harmony produced.\n\nFurther, it is to be observed that in the Greek arithmetical notation eight letters are used to denote units, eight tens, and eight hundreds: total 888; but this is exactly the numerical value of the letters in the name Ἰησοῦς. Similarly, the Α and Ω is identified with the περιστερά which descended on Jesus, the numerical value being in both cases 801.\n\nOther mysteries are found in the six letters of the name Ἰησοῦς (see \"Episemon\", below), the eight letters of χρειστός, which again added to the four of Υίος make twelve. These, however, are only the spoken names known to ordinary Christians; the unspoken names of Jesus and Christ are of twenty-four and thirty letters respectively. Either Hippolytus, or an early copyist of his, makes an attempt to solve the mystery of the unspoken names by writing at full length the letters of the name χρειστός; χεῖ, ῥώ, εἴ, ἰῶτα, σίγμα, ταῦ, οὐ, σάν; but we have here only twenty-four letters instead of thirty, so we must be content to remain in ignorance of what would seem to have been one of the most valuable secrets of this sect.\n\nTo understand the generation of the thirty Aeons from the Ogdoad, we have only to take the first eight numbers and add them up, leaving out six—for it is the Episemon and not a letter of the usual Greek alphabet:—\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 30 \nAgain, we find the fall of the twelfth Aeon, Sophia, indicated in the alphabet; for Λ, which arithmetically denotes 30, the number of the Aeons, is only the eleventh letter in the alphabet. But it set about to seek another like itself, and so the next letter is M, or ΛΛ. Again, add up the numerical value of all the letters of the alphabet ending with λ and we have ninety-nine; that is deficiency, a number still counted on the left hand, which they who have \"knowledge\" escape by following after the one which, added to ninety-nine, transfers them to the right hand. The reader will remember Juvenal's \"jam dextera computat annos.\"\n\nEven numbers are female, odd numbers male, by the union of the first of these, 2 and 3, was begotten the Episemon, or 6, the number of Salvation.\n\nIn the account of his system given by Irenaeus (I. xiv.), copied by Hippolytus (\"Ref\". vi. 45) and by Epiphanius (\"Haer\". 34), τὸ ἐπίσημον is repeatedly used to denote the numerical character for six; the number 6 is ὁ ἐπίσημος ἀριθμός; the six-lettered name Ἰησοῦς is τὸ ἐπίσημον ὄνομα, etc., language perplexing to the old Latin translator, who renders the word by \"insignis.\"\nA similar use of the word is found in Clement of Alexandria (\"Strom\". vi. 16); but this cannot be called a quite independent illustration, for the coincidences are found to be such as to put it beyond doubt that Clement, in his account of the mysteries of the number 6, makes unacknowledged use of the same writings of Marcus as were employed by Irenaeus. Eusebius (\"Quaest. ad Marin\". Mai, \"Nov. Pat. Bib\". iv. 299), copied by Jerome or Pseudo-Jerome (\"Brev. in Psal\". 77, vii. 198, ed. Vallars.), suggests, as a way of reconciling the difference between the evangelists as to whether the Lord suffered at the third or the sixth hour, that a transcriber's error may have arisen from the likeness of Gamma and the Episemon, \"i.e.\" apparently Γ and Ϝ.\n\nThe source whence all modern writers have learned their use of the word episemon is Joseph Justus Scaliger's essay on the origin of the Ionic letters. He there quotes as from Bede, \"de Indigitatione\", a statement of an old grammarian, who, having mentioned that the Greeks denote numbers by letters, and for this purpose join to the letters of their alphabet three other characters, goes on as follows:—\n\"Prima est ς quae dicitur Episimon et est nota numeri VI.; secunda est G quae vocatur kophe et valet in numero XC.; tertia est ϡ quae dicitur enneacosia quia valent DCCCC.\" \nHere, as well as in the preceding passages, episemon is used with special reference to the character for six; but Scaliger turns into Greek the phrase \"nota numeri VI.\" τὸ ἐπίσημον τοῦ ἑξ ἀριθμοῦ, and seems to have inferred that the marks for the numbers 90 and 900 had equal rights to the same title; and he also gives the name Episemon to each of the six Phoenician letters said not to have been received by the Ionians, saying, for instance, that the letter ἧτα was originally an episemon, and distinguishing between the episemon of the number 6 and the digamma or episemon of Vau. He does not name his authority for this way of speaking; nor do we know that the character which was by some called βαῦ, and by others τὸ ἐπίσημον, was ever called by any one before Scaliger by the combination ἐπίσημον βαῦ. However this may be, Scaliger has been followed by all who have written on the subject since his time.\n\nThe true account of these three characters seems to be that though the Phoenicians themselves did not use the letters of their alphabet for purposes of numeration, the Greeks, who derived their alphabet from them, did so in the 5th century BC; that their alphabet then still contained two of the Phoenician letters which in the next century were disused, viz., βαῦ in the sixth place, and κόππα, the Roman Q, coming after π; that these letters then took their natural place in the system of numeration, which was afterwards made complete by the addition, at the end of the letters of the alphabet, of another character to denote 900, which from its shape was at a considerably later period called σανπῖ. The character for six had not come to be identified with the abbreviation for στ in the time of Marcus, as known through Hippolytus. In calculating the numerical value of χρειστός he counts the σ and τ separately; and it is to be noted that he calls the former \"s\" Sigma, and the latter San. It is possible that Marcus expressly identified his episemon with the digamma, for though in Irenaeus, the reading is undoubtedly διπλο γράμματα, the context gives probability to Dr. Hort's conjecture that Marcus wrote γάμματα. He says that this number added to the number of the twenty-four letters makes thirty. Now the double letters are already included in the twenty-four, but the Digamma stands outside the alphabet, and therefore its number might properly be added to that of the letters.\n\nWith regard to the properties of the number 6, Marcus and Clement were in part indebted to Philo of Alexandria, who explains (\"De Op. Mund\". 3) that it is the first perfect number, \"i.e.\", according to Euclid's definition, one equal to the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3 which divide it without remainder (Aug. \"de Civ. Dei\", xi. 30), the second such number being 28, which is the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 (\"Orig. t.\" 28 in \"S. Joann\".); that being 2 × 3 it arises from the marriage of a male and female, \"i.e.\", odd and even number; that there are six directions of motion, forward, backward, right, left, up, down; etc. Marcus observed that \nAnd thence concludes that this number has the power not only of production, but of regeneration. As seven is the number of the heavens, and eight is the supercelestial ogdoad, so six denotes the material creation (see also Heracleon); and, in particular, the material body through which the Saviour revealed Himself to men's senses, and conveyed to them that enlightenment of their ignorance in which redemption consisted. Clement, if not Marcus, finds the Saviour's higher nature represented by the episemon, which is not taken into account by one who looks merely at the order of the letters in the alphabet, but reveals itself in the system of numeration.\n\nIrenaeus points out that the mysteries of Marcus all depend on the employment of the modern form of the Greek alphabet, and that they disappear when a Semitic alphabet is used. He shows also (ii. 24) that it is possible to say as fine things about the properties of the number 5 as about those of the numbers which are glorified by Marcus.\n\nThe Marcosians had formulae and sacraments of redemption. If so great mysteries were contained in names, it naturally followed that to know the right name of each celestial power was a matter of vital importance; and such knowledge the teachers promised to bestow. Others held that these applications could not procure spiritual redemption—only by knowledge (\"gnosis\") could such redemption be effected.\n\nEusebius of Caesarea writes that the Marcosians baptised people \"Into the name of the unknown father of the universe, into truth, the mother of all things, into the one that descended upon Jesus.\" This may show that the Trinitarian baptismal formula existed at least at that time, and probably earlier, and that the Marcosians adopted it as their own.\nMarcus taught that the baptism of the visible Jesus was but for the forgiveness of sins, but that the redemption of Christ, who in that baptism descended, was for perfection; the one was merely psychical, the other spiritual. Of the latter are interpreted the words in which Jesus spoke of another baptism (; ).\n\nSome conferred this redemption by baptism with special invocations; others went so far as to reject Christian baptism and to substitute a mixture of oil and water which they poured over the head of the candidate. By confirmation the Gnostics intended not so much to give the Holy Ghost as to seal the candidates against the attacks of the Archons, by which the initiated would after death become incomprehensible and invisible, and leaving their bodies in this lower creation and their souls with the Demiurge, ascend in their spirits to the Pleroma. Probably the Egyptian religion contributed this element to Gnosticism. Some of these Marcosian formulae were in Hebrew, of which Irenaeus has preserved specimens much corrupted by copyists.\n\nA knowledge of astrology was among Marcus's accomplishments, and apparently some chemical knowledge, with which he gained a reputation of magical skill. The eucharistic cup of mingled wine and water was seen under his invocation to change to a purple red; and his disciples were told that this was because the great \"Charis\" (Grace) had dropped some of her blood into the cup. Sometimes he would hand the cup to women, and bid them in his presence pronounce the eucharistic words:\n\nThen he would pour from their consecrated cup into a much larger one held by himself, and the liquor, miraculously increased at this prayer, would be seen to rise up and fill the larger vessel.\n\nMarcus taught his female disciples to prophesy. Casting lots at their meetings, he would command her on whom the lot fell boldly to utter the words which were suggested to her mind, and such words were accepted by the hearers as prophetic utterances.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "92550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92550", "title": "Omar Khayyam", "text": "Omar Khayyam\n\nOmar Khayyam (; ; 18 May 1048 – 4 December 1131) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, and poet. He was born in Nishapur, in northeastern Iran, and spent most of his life near the court of the Karakhanid and Seljuq rulers in the period which witnessed the First Crusade.\n\nHe was Named as \"Non-Linear Optimization's Father\". In a speech at IUT university he was announced that the exams on Tuesdays are forbidden and it may cause crashes in the stars. As a mathematician, he is most notable for his work on the classification and solution of cubic equations, where he provided geometric solutions by the intersection of conics. Khayyam also contributed to the understanding of the parallel axiom. As an astronomer, he designed the Jalali calendar, a solar calendar with a very precise 33-year intercalation cycle.\n\nThere is a tradition of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam, written in the form of quatrains (\"rubāʿiyāt\" ). This poetry became widely known to the English-reading world in a translation by Edward FitzGerald (\"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\", 1859), which enjoyed great success in the Orientalism of the fin de siècle.\n\nOmar Khayyam was born in Nishapur, a leading metropolis in Khorasan during medieval times that reached its climax of prosperity in the eleventh century under the Seljuq dynasty. Nishapur was then religiously a major center of Zoroastrians. It is likely that Khayyam's father was a Zoroastrian who had converted to Islam. He was born into a family of tent-makers (\"Khayyam\"). His full name, as it appears in the Arabic sources, was \"Abu’l Fath Omar ibn Ibrāhīm al-Khayyām\".\nIn medieval Persian texts he is usually simply called \"Omar Khayyām\".\nThe historian Bayhaqi, who was personally acquainted with Omar, provides the full details of his horoscope: \"he was Gemini, the sun and Mercury being in the ascendant[...]\". This was used by modern scholars to establish his date of birth as 18 May 1048.\n\nHis boyhood was passed in Nishapur. His gifts were recognized by his early tutors who sent him to study under Imam Muwaffaq Nīshābūrī, the greatest teacher of the Khorasan region who tutored the children of the highest nobility. In 1073, at the age of twenty-six, he entered the service of Sultan Malik-Shah I as an adviser. In 1076 Khayyam was invited to Isfahan by the vizier and political figure Nizam al-Mulk to take advantage of the libraries and centers in learning there. His years in Isfahan were productive. It was at this time that he began to study the work of Greek mathematicians Euclid and Apollonius much more closely. But after the death of Malik-Shah and his vizier (presumably by the Assassins' sect), Omar had fallen from favour at court, and as a result, he soon set out on his pilgrimage to Mecca. A possible ulterior motive for his pilgrimage reported by Al-Qifti, is that he was attacked by the clergy for his apparent skepticism. So he decided to perform his pilgrimage as a way of demonstrating his faith and freeing himself from all suspicion of unorthodoxy. He was then invited by the new Sultan Sanjar to Marv, possibly to work as a court astrologer. He was later allowed to return to Nishapur owing to his declining health. Upon his return, he seemed to have lived the life of a recluse. Khayyam died in 1131, and is buried in the Khayyam Garden.\n\nKhayyam was famous during his life as a mathematician. His surviving mathematical works include: \"A commentary on the difficulties concerning the postulates of Euclid's Elements\" (, completed in December 1077), \"On the division of a quadrant of a circle\" (, undated but completed prior to the treatise on algebra), and \"On proofs for problems concerning Algebra\" (, most likely completed in 1079). He furthermore wrote a treatise on extracting the n root of natural numbers, which has been lost.\n\nA part of Khayyam's commentary on Euclid's Elements deals with the parallel axiom. The treatise of Khayyam can be considered the first treatment of the axiom not based on petitio principii, but on a more intuitive postulate. Khayyam refutes the previous attempts by other mathematicians to \"prove\" the proposition, mainly on grounds that each of them had postulated something that was by no means easier to admit than the Fifth Postulate itself. Drawing upon Aristotle's views, he rejects the usage of movement in geometry and therefore dismisses the different attempt by Al-Haytham. Unsatisfied with the failure of mathematicians to prove Euclid's statement from his other postulates, Omar tried to connect the axiom with the Fourth Postulate, which states that all right angles are equal to one another.\n\nKhayyam was the first to consider the three cases of acute, obtuse, and right angle for the summit angles of a Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral, three cases which are exhaustive and pairwise mutually exclusive. After proving a number of theorems about them, he proved that the Postulate V is a consequence of the right angle hypothesis, and refuted the obtuse and acute cases as self-contradictory. Khayyam's elaborate attempt to prove the parallel postulate was significant for the further development of geometry, as it clearly shows the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries. The hypothesis of the acute, obtuse, and that of the right angle are now known to lead respectively to the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry of Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky, to that of Riemannian geometry, and to Euclidean geometry.\n\nTusi's commentaries on Khayyam's treatment of parallels made its way to Europe. John Wallis, the professor of geometry at Oxford, translated Tusi's commentary into Latin. Jesuit geometrician Girolamo Saccheri, whose work (\"euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus\", 1733) is generally considered as the first step in the eventual development of non-Euclidean geometry, was familiar with the work of Wallis. The American historian of mathematics, David Eugene Smith mentions that Saccheri \"used the same lemma as the one of Tusi, even lettering the figure in precisely the same way and using the lemma for the same purpose\". He further says that \"Tusi distinctly states that it is due to Omar Khayyam, and from the text, it seems clear that the latter was his inspirer.\"\n\nThis treatise on Euclid contains another contribution dealing with the theory of proportions and with the compounding of ratios. Khayyam discusses the relationship between the concept of ratio and the concept of number and explicitly raises various theoretical difficulties. In particular, he contributes to the theoretical study of the concept of irrational number. Displeased with Euclid's definition of equal ratios, he redefined the concept of a number by the use of a continuous fraction as the means of expressing a ratio. Rosenfeld and Youschkevitch (1973) argue that \"by placing irrational quantities and numbers on the same operational scale, [Khayyam] began a true revolution in the doctrine of number.\" Likewise, it was noted by D. J. Struik that Omar was \"on the road to that extension of the number concept which leads to the notion of the real number.\"\n\nRashed and Vahabzadeh (2000) have argued that because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations, Khayyam can be considered the precursor of Descartes in the invention of analytic geometry. In \"The Treatise on the Division of a Quadrant of a Circle\" Khayyam applied algebra to geometry. In this work, he devoted himself mainly to investigating whether it is possible to divide a circular quadrant into two parts such that the line segments projected from the dividing point to the perpendicular diameters of the circle form a specific ratio. His solution, in turn, employed several curve constructions that led to equations containing cubic and quadratic terms.\n\nKhayyam seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations and the first to geometrically solve every type of cubic equation, so far as positive roots are concerned. The treatise on algebra contains his work on cubic equations. It is divided into three parts: (i) equations which can be solved with compass and straight edge, (ii) equations which can be solved by means of conic sections, and (iii) equations which involve the inverse of the unknown.\n\nKhayyam produced an exhaustive list of all possible equations involving lines, squares, and cubes. He considered three binomial equations, nine trinomial equations, and seven tetranomial equations. For the first and second degree polynomials, he provided numerical solutions by geometric construction. He concluded that there are fourteen different types of cubics that cannot be reduced to an equation of a lesser degree. For these he could not accomplish the construction of his unknown segment with compass and straight edge. He proceeded to present geometric solutions to all types of cubic equations using the properties of conic sections. The prerequisite lemmas for Khayyam’s geometrical proof include Euclid VI, Prop 13, and Apollonius II, Prop 12. The positive root of a cubic equation was determined as the abscissa of a point of intersection of two conics, for instance, the intersection of two parabolas, or the intersection of a parabola and a circle, etc. However, he acknowledged that the arithmetic problem of these cubics was still unsolved, adding that \"possibly someone else will come to know it after us\". This task remained open until the sixteenth century, where algebraic solution of the cubic equation was found in its generality by Cardano, Del Ferro, and Tartaglia in Renaissance Italy.\n\nIn effect, Khayyam's work is an effort to unify algebra and geometry. This particular geometric solution of cubic equations has been further investigated by M. Hachtroudi and extended to solving fourth-degree equations. Although similar methods had appeared sporadically since Menaechmus, Khayyam's work can be considered the first systematic study and the first exact method of solving cubic equations. The mathematician Woepcke (1851) who offered translations of Khayyam's algebra into French praised him for his \"power of generalization and his rigorously systematic procedure.\"\n\nIn his algebraic treatise, Khayyam alludes to a book he had written on the extraction of the formula_1th root of the numbers using a law which he had discovered which did not depend on geometric figures. This book was most likely titled \"The difficulties of arithmetic\" (), and is not extant. Based on the context, some historians of mathematics such as D. J. Struik, believe that Omar must have known the formula for the expansion of the binomial formula_2, where is a positive integer. The case of power 2 is explicitly stated in Euclid's elements and the case of at most power 3 had been established by Indian mathematicians. Khayyam was the mathematician who noticed the importance of a general binomial theorem. The argument supporting the claim that Khayyam had a general binomial theorem is based on his ability to extract roots. The arrangement of numbers known as Pascal's triangle enables one to write down the coefficients in a binomial expansion. This triangular array sometimes is known as Omar Khayyam's triangle.\n\nIn 1074, Omar Khayyam was commissioned by Sultan Malik-Shah to build an observatory at Isfahan and reform the Persian calendar. There was a panel of eight scholars working under the direction of Khayyam to make large-scale astronomical observations and revise the astronomical tables. Recalibrating the calendar fixed the first day of the year at the exact moment of the passing of the Sun's center across vernal equinox. This marks the beginning of spring or Nowrūz, a day in which the Sun enters the first degree of Aries before noon. The resulted calendar was named in Malik-Shah's honor as the Jalālī calendar, and was inaugurated on Friday, March 15, 1079. The observatory itself was disused after the death of Malik-Shah in 1092.\n\nThe Jalālī calendar was a true solar calendar where the duration of each month is equal to the time of the passage of the Sun across the corresponding sign of the Zodiac. The calendar reform introduced a unique 33-year intercalation cycle. As indicated by the works of Khazini, Khayyam's group implemented an intercalation system based on quadrennial and quinquennial leap years. Therefore, the calendar consisted of 25 ordinary years that included 365 days, and 8 leap years that included 366 days. The calendar remained in use across Greater Iran from the 11th to the 20th centuries. In 1911 the Jalali calendar became the official national calendar of Qajar Iran. In 1925 this calendar was simplified and the names of the months were modernized, resulting in the . The Jalali calendar is more accurate than the Gregorian calendar of 1582, with an error of one day accumulating over 5,000 years, compared to one day every 3,330 years in the Gregorian calendar. \nMoritz Cantor considered it the most perfect calendar ever devised.\n\nOne of his pupils Nizami Aruzi of Samarcand relates that Khayyam apparently did not have a belief in astrology and divination: \"I did not observe that he (\"scil.\" Omar Khayyam) had any great belief in astrological predictions, nor have I seen or heard of any of the great [scientists] who had such belief.\" While working for Sultan Sanjar as an astrologer he was asked to predict the weather – a job that he apparently did not do well. George Saliba (2002) explains that the term , used in various sources in which references to Omar's life and work could be found, has sometimes been incorrectly translated to mean astrology. He adds: \"from at least the middle of the tenth century, according to Farabi's enumeration of the sciences, that this science, , was already split into two parts, one dealing with astrology and the other with theoretical mathematical astronomy.\"\n\nA popular claim to the effect that Khayyam believed in heliocentrism is based on Edward FitzGerald's popular but anachronistic rendering of Khayyam's poetry, in which the first lines are mistranslated with a heliocentric image of the Sun flinging \"the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight\".\n\nHe has a short treatise devoted to Archimedes' principle (in full title, \"On the Deception of Knowing the Two Quantities of Gold and Silver in a Compound Made of the Two\"). For a compound of gold adulterated with silver, he describes a method to measure more exactly the weight per capacity of each element. It involves weighing the compound both in air and in water, since weights are easier to measure exactly than volumes. By repeating the same with both gold and silver one finds exactly how much heavier than water gold, silver and the compound were. This treatise was extensively examined by Eilhard Wiedemann who believed that Khayyam's solution was more accurate and sophisticated than that of Khazini and Al-Nayrizi who also dealt with the subject elsewhere.\n\nAnother short treatise is concerned with music theory in which he discusses the connection between music and arithmetic. Khayyam's contribution was in providing a systematic classification of musical scales, and discussing the mathematical relationship among notes, minor, major and tetrachords.\n\nThe earliest allusion to Omar Khayyam's poetry is from the historian Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani, a younger contemporary of Khayyam, who explicitly identifies him as both a poet and a scientist (, 1174). One of the earliest specimens of Omar Khayyam's Rubiyat is from Fakhr al-Din Razi. In his work (ca. 1160), he quotes one of his poems (corresponding to quatrain LXII of FitzGerald's first edition). Daya in his writings (, ca. 1230) quotes two quatrains, one of which is the same as the one already reported by Razi. An additional quatrain is quoted by the historian Juvayni (, ca. 1226-1283). In 1340 Jajarmi includes thirteen quatrains of Khayyam in his work containing an anthology of the works of famous Persian poets (), two of which have hitherto been known from the older sources. A comparatively late manuscript is the Bodleian MS. Ouseley 140, written in Shiraz in 1460, which contains 158 quatrains on 47 folia. The manuscript belonged to William Ouseley (1767-1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.\n\nThere are occasional quotes of verses attributed to Omar in texts attributed to authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, but these are also of doubtful authenticity, so that skeptic scholars point out that the entire tradition may be pseudepigraphic. \nHans Heinrich Schaeder in 1934 commented that the name of Omar Khayyam \"is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature\" due to the lack of any material that could confidently be attributed to him. \nDe Blois (2004) presents a bibliography of the manuscript tradition, concluding pessimistically that the situation has not changed significantly since Schaeder's time.\nFive of the quatrains later attributed to Omar are found as early as 30 years after his death, quoted in \"Sindbad-Nameh\". While this establishes that these specific verses were in circulation in Omar's time or shortly later, it doesn't imply that the verses must be his. De Blois concludes that at the least the process of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam appears to have begun already in the 13th century. Edward Granville Browne (1906) notes the difficulty to disentangle the authentic from the spurious quatrains: \"while it is certain that Khayyam wrote many quatrains, it is hardly possible, save in a few exceptional cases, to assert positively that he wrote any of those ascribed to him\".\n\nIn addition to the Persian quatrains, there are twenty-five Arabic poems attributed to Khayyam which are attested by historians such as al-Isfahani, Shahrazuri (, ca. 1201-1211), Qifti (, 1255), and Hamdallah Mustawfi (, 1339).\n\nRichard N. Frye (1975) emphasizes that there are a number of other Persian scholars who occasionally wrote quatrains, including Avicenna, Ghazzali, and Tusi. He concludes that it is also possible that poetry with Khayyam was the amusement of his leisure hours: \"these brief poems seem often to have been the work of scholars and scientists who composed them, perhaps, in moments of relaxation to edify or amuse the inner circle of their disciples\".\n\nThe poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam has contributed greatly to his popular fame in the modern period as a direct result of the extreme popularity of the translation of such verses into English by Edward FitzGerald (1859). FitzGerald's \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" contains loose translations of quatrains from The Bodleian manuscript. It enjoyed such success in the fin de siècle period that a bibliography compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions, and many more have been published since.\n\nKhayyam considered himself intellectually to be a student of Avicenna. According to Al-Bayhaqi, he was reading the metaphysics in Avicenna's \"the Book of Healing\" before he died. There are six philosophical papers believed to have been written by Khayyam. One of them, \"On existence\" (), is written in Persian and deals with the subject of existence and its relationship to universals. Another paper, titled \"The necessity of contradiction in the world, determinism and subsistence\" (), is written in Arabic and deals with free will and determinism. The titles of his other works are \"On being and necessity\" (), \"The Treatise on Transcendence in Existence\" (), \"On the knowledge of the universal principles of existence\" (), and \"Abridgement concerning natural phenomena\" ().\n\nA literal reading of Khayyam's quatrains leads to the interpretation of his philosophic attitude toward life as a combination of pessimism, nihilism, Epicureanism, fatalism, and agnosticism. This view is taken by Iranologists such as Arthur Christensen, H. Schaeder, Richard N. Frye, E. D. Ross, E.H. Whinfield and George Sarton. Conversely, the Khayyamic quatrains have also been described as mystical Sufi poetry. However, this is the view of a minority of scholars. In addition to his Persian quatrains, J. C. E. Bowen (1973) mentions that Khayyam's Arabic poems also \"express a pessimistic viewpoint which is entirely consonant with the outlook of the deeply thoughtful rationalist philosopher that Khayyam is known historically to have been.\" Edward FitzGerald emphasized the religious skepticism he found in Khayyam. In his preface to the \"Rubáiyát\" he claimed that he \"was hated and dreaded by the Sufis\", and denied any pretense at divine allegory: \"his Wine is the veritable Juice of the Grape: his Tavern, where it was to be had: his \"Saki\", the Flesh and\nBlood that poured it out for him.\" Sadegh Hedayat is one of the most notable proponents of Khayyam's philosophy as agnostic skepticism, and according to Jan Rypka (1934), he even considered Khayyam an atheist. Hedayat (1923) states that \"while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine.\" \nIn a later study (1934–35) he further contends that Khayyam's usage of Sufic terminology such as \"wine\" is literal and that he turned to the pleasures of the moment as an antidote to his existential sorrow: \"Khayyam took refuge in wine to ward off bitterness and to blunt the cutting edge of his thoughts.\" In this tradition, Omar Khayyam's poetry has been cited in the context of New Atheism, e.g. in \"The Portable Atheist\" by Christopher Hitchens.\n\nAl-Qifti (ca. 1172–1248) appears to confirm this view of Omar's philosophy. In his work \"The History of Learned Men\"\nhe reports that Omar's poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda. He also mentions that he was at one point indicted for impiety, but went on a pilgrimage to prove he was pious. The report has it that upon returning to his native city he concealed his deepest convictions and practised a strictly religious life, going morning and evening to the place of worship.\n\nIn the context of a piece entitled \"On the Knowledge Of the Principals of Existence\", Khayyam endorses the Sufi path. Csillik (1960) suggests the possibility that Omar Khayyam could see in Sufism an ally against orthodox religiosity. Other commentators do not accept that Omar's poetry has an anti-religious agenda and interpret his references to wine and drunkenness in the conventional metaphorical sense common in Sufism. The French translator J. B. Nicolas held that Omar's constant exhortations to drink wine should not be taken literally, but should be seen in Sufi terms as representing an enlightened state. The view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard (1915), Idries Shah (1999), and Dougan (1991) who attributes the reputation of hedonism to the failings of FitzGerald's translation, arguing that Omar's poetry is to be understood as \"deeply esoteric\". On the other hand, Iranian experts such as Mohammad Ali Foroughi and Mojtaba Minovi unanimously rejected the hypothesis that Omar Khayyam was a Sufi. Foroughi stated that Khayyam's ideas may have been consistent with that of Sufis at times but there is no evidence that he was formally a Sufi. Aminrazavi (2007) states that \"Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his \"Rubāʿīyyāt\" extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine.\" Furthermore, Frye (1975) emphasizes that Khayyam was intensely disliked by a number of celebrated Sufi mystics who belonged to the same century. This includes Shams Tabrizi (spiritual guide of Rumi), Najm al-Din Daya who described Omar Khayyam as \"an unhappy philosopher, atheist, and materialist\", and Attar who regarded him not as a fellow-mystic but a free-thinking scientist who awaited punishments hereafter.\n\nSeyyed Hossein Nasr argues that it is \"reductive\" to use a literal interpretation of his verses (many of which are of uncertain authenticity to begin with) to establish Omar Khayyam's philosophy. Instead, he adduces Khayyam's interpretive translation of Avicenna's treatise \"Discourse on Unity\" (), where he\nexpresses orthodox views on Divine Unity in agreement with the author. The prose works believed to be Omar's are written in the Peripatetic style and are explicitly theistic, dealing with subjects such as the existence of God and theodicy. As noted by Bowen these works indicate his involvement in the problems of metaphysics rather than in the subtleties of Sufism. As evidence of Khayyam's faith and/or conformity to Islamic customs, Aminrazavi mentions that in his treatises he offers salutations and prayers, praising God and Muhammad. In most biographical extracts, he is referred to with religious honorifics such as , \"The Patron of Faith\" (), and \"The Evidence of Truth\" (). He also notes that biographers who praise his religiosity generally avoid making reference to his poetry, while the ones who mention them often do not praise his religious character. For instance Al-Bayhaqi's account which antedates by some years other biographical notices, speaks of Omar as a very pious man who professed orthodox views down to his last hour.\n\nOn the basis of all the existing textual and biographical evidence, the question remains somewhat open, and as a result Khayyam has received sharply conflicting appreciations and criticisms.\n\nThe various biographical extracts referring to Omar Khayyam describe him as unequalled in scientific knowledge and achievement during his time. Many called him with the epithet \"King of the Wise\" (). Shahrazuri (d. 1300) esteems him highly as a mathematician, and claims that he may be regarded as \"the successor of Avicenna in the various branches of philosophic learning.\" Al-Qifti (d. 1248) even though disagreeing with his views concedes he was \"unrivalled in his knowledge of natural philosophy and astronomy.\" Despite being hailed as a poet by a number of biographers, according to Richard Nelson Frye \"it is still possible to argue that Khayyam's status as a poet of the first rank is a comparatively late development.\"\n\nThomas Hyde was the first European to call attention to Omar and to translate one of his quatrains into Latin (\"Historia religionis veterum Persarum eorumque magorum\", 1700). Western interest in Persia grew with the Orientalism movement in the 19th century. Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774-1856) translated some of Khayyam's poems into German in 1818, and Gore Ouseley (1770-1844) into English in 1846, but Khayyam remained relatively unknown in the West until after the publication of Edward FitzGerald's \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" in 1859. FitzGerald's work at first was unsuccessful but was popularised by Whitley Stokes from 1861 onward, and the work came to be greatly admired by the Pre-Raphaelites. In 1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed which increased interest in the work in America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent of the formation of numerous \"Omar Khayyam Clubs\" and a \"fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat\" Khayyam's poems have been translated into many languages, many of the more recent ones are more literal than that of FitzGerald.\n\nFitzGerald's translation was a factor in rekindling interest in Khayyam as a poet even in his native Iran. Sadegh Hedayat in his \"Songs of Khayyam\" (\"Taranehha-ye Khayyam\", 1934) reintroduced Omar's poetic legacy to modern Iran. Under the Pahlavi dynasty, a new monument of white marble, designed by the architect Houshang Seyhoun, was erected over his tomb. A statue by Abolhassan Sadighi was erected in Laleh Park, Tehran in the 1960s, and a bust by the same sculptor was placed near Khayyam's mausoleum in Nishapur. In 2009, the state of Iran donated a pavilion to the United Nations Office in Vienna, inaugurated at Vienna International Center. In 2016, three statues of Khayyam were unveiled: one at the University of Oklahoma, one in Nishapur and one in Florence, Italy. Over 150 composers have used the \"Rubaiyat\" as their source of inspiration. The earliest such composer was Liza Lehmann.\n\nFitzGerald rendered Omar's name as \"Tentmaker\", and the anglicized name of \"Omar the Tentmaker\" resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, Nathan Haskell Dole published a novel called \"Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia\" in 1898. \"Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur\" is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. \"Omar the Tentmaker\" is also the title of a 1914 play by Richard Walton Tully in an oriental setting, adapted as a silent film in 1922. US General Omar Bradley was given the nickname \"Omar the Tent-Maker\" in World War II. The name has also been recorded as a slang expression for \"penis\".\n\nThe lunar crater Omar Khayyam was named in his honour in 1970, as was the minor planet 3095 Omarkhayyam discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1980.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "201103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201103", "title": "Otto Weininger", "text": "Otto Weininger\n\nOtto Weininger (; 3 April 1880 – 4 October 1903) was an Austrian philosopher who lived in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1903, he published the book \"Geschlecht und Charakter\" (\"Sex and Character\"), which gained popularity after his suicide at the age of 23. Parts of his work were adapted for use by the Nazi regime (while at the same time denouncing him). Weininger was a large influence on Ludwig Wittgenstein, August Strindberg, and relatively on James Joyce.\n\nOtto Weininger was born on 3 April 1880 in Vienna, a son of the Jewish goldsmith Leopold Weininger and his wife Adelheid. After attending primary school and graduating from secondary school in July 1898, Weininger registered at the University of Vienna in October of the same year. He studied philosophy and psychology but took courses in natural sciences and medicine as well. Weininger learned Greek, Latin, French and English very early, later also Spanish and Italian, and acquired passive knowledge of the languages of August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen (i.e., Swedish and Danish/Norwegian).\n\nIn the autumn of 1901 Weininger tried to find a publisher for his work \"Eros and the Psyche\" – which he submitted to his professors and as his thesis in 1902. He met Sigmund Freud, who, however, did not recommend the text to a publisher. His professors accepted the thesis and Weininger received his Ph.D. degree in July 1902. Shortly thereafter he became proudly and enthusiastically a Protestant.\n\nIn 1902 Weininger went to Bayreuth where he witnessed a performance of Richard Wagner's \"Parsifal\", which left him deeply impressed. Via Dresden and Copenhagen he made his way to Christiania (Oslo) where he for the first time saw Henrik Ibsen's liberation drama \"Peer Gynt\" on stage. Upon his return to Vienna Weininger suffered from fits of deep depression. The decision to take his own life gradually took shape in his mind; after a long discussion with his friend Artur Gerber, however, Weininger realized that \"it is not yet time\".\n\nIn June 1903, after months of concentrated work, his book \"Sex and Character – A Fundamental Investigation\" – an attempt \"to place sex relations in a new and decisive light\" – was published by the Vienna publishers Braumüller & Co. The book contained his thesis to which three vital chapters were added: (XII) \"The Nature of Woman and her Relation to the Universe\", (XIII) \"Judaism\", (XIV) \"Women and Humanity\".\n\nWhile the book was not received negatively, it did not create the expected stir. Weininger was attacked by Paul Julius Möbius, professor in Leipzig and author of the book \"On the Physiological Deficiency of Women\", and was accused of plagiarizing. Deeply disappointed and seemingly depressed, Weininger left for Italy.\n\nBack in Vienna he spent his last five days with his parents. On 3 October he took a room in the house in Schwarzspanierstraße 15 where Ludwig van Beethoven died. He told the landlady that he was not to be disturbed before morning since he planned to work and then to go to bed late. This night he wrote two letters, one addressed to his father, the other one to his brother Richard, telling them that he was going to shoot himself.\n\nOn 4 October Weininger was found mortally wounded, having shot himself in the chest. He died in the Wiener Allgemeines Krankenhaus (Vienna General Hospital), and was buried in the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery in Vienna.\n\n\"Sex and Character\" argues that all people are composed of a mixture of male and female substance, and attempts to support this view scientifically. The male aspect is active, productive, conscious and moral/logical, while the female aspect is passive, unproductive, unconscious and amoral/alogical. Weininger argues that emancipation is only possible for the \"masculine woman\", e.g. some lesbians, and that the female life is consumed with the sexual function: both with the act, as a prostitute, and the product, as a mother. Woman is a \"matchmaker\". By contrast, the duty of the male, or the masculine aspect of personality, is to strive to become a genius, and to forgo sexuality for an abstract love of the absolute, God, which he finds within himself.\n\nA significant part of his book is about the nature of genius. Weininger argues that there is no such thing as a person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.\n\nIn a separate chapter, Weininger, himself a Jew who had converted to Christianity in 1902, analyzes the archetypal Jew as feminine, and thus profoundly irreligious, without true individuality (soul), and without a sense of good and evil. Christianity is described as \"the highest expression of the highest faith\", while Judaism is called \"the extreme of cowardliness\". Weininger decries the decay of modern times, and attributes much of it to feminine (or identically, \"Jewish\") character. By Weininger's reckoning \"everyone\" shows some femininity, and what he calls \"Jewishness\".\n\nWeininger's suicide in the house in Vienna, where Beethoven had died, the man he considered one of the greatest geniuses of all, made him a \"cause célèbre\", inspired several imitation suicides, and created a lot more interest in his book. The book received glowing reviews by August Strindberg, who wrote that it had \"probably solved the hardest of all problems\", the \"woman problem\". It furthermore attracted the attention of Nikolai Berdyaev, who claimed that \"after Nietzsche there was nothing already in this [modern German] fleeting culture so remarkable.\"\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein read the book as a schoolboy and was deeply impressed by it, later listing it as one of his influences and recommending it to friends. Wittgenstein is recalled as saying that he thought Weininger was \"a great genius\". However, Wittgenstein's deep admiration of Weininger's thought was coupled with a fundamental disagreement with his position. Wittgenstein writes to G. E. Moore: \"It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great.\" In the same letter to Moore, Wittgenstein added that if one were to add a negation sign before the whole of \"Sex and Character\", one would have expressed an important truth; that is, he did not disagree with Weininger point by point but as a whole.\n\nIsolated parts of Weininger's writings were used by Nazi propaganda, despite the fact that Weininger actively argued against the ideas of race that came to be identified with the Nazis. In his private conversations, Hitler recalled a remark his mentor Dietrich Eckart made about Weininger: \"I only knew one decent Jew and he committed suicide...\". \n\nIn the chapter titled \"Judaism\" in his book \"Sex and Character\" Weininger writes:\n\nThe Jewish race has been chosen by me as a subject of discussion, because, as will be shown, it presents the gravest and most formidable difficulties for my views.\n\nI must, however, make clear what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a recognised creed. I think of it as a tendency of the mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.\n\n...Thus the fact is explained that the bitterest Antisemites are to be found amongst the Jews themselves.\n\nThe true concept of the State is foreign to the Jew, because he, like the woman, is wanting in personality; his failure to grasp the idea of true society is due to his lack of free intelligible ego. Like women, Jews tend to adhere together, but they do not associate as free independent individuals mutually respecting each other's individuality.\n\nAs there is no real dignity in women, so what is meant by the word \"gentleman\" does not exist amongst the Jews. The genuine Jew fails in this innate good breeding by which alone individuals honour their own individuality and respect that of others. There is no Jewish nobility, and this is the more surprising as Jewish pedigrees can be traced back for thousands of years.\n\nThe familiar Jewish arrogance has a similar explanation...\n\nLater in the same chapter he writes: \n\nThe faults of the Jewish race have often been attributed to the repression of that race by Aryans, and many Christians are still disposed to blame themselves in this respect. But the self- reproach is not justified. Outward circumstances do not mould a race in one direction, unless there is in the race the innate tendency to respond to the moulding forces; the total result comes at least as much from a natural disposition as from the modifying circumstances. \n\nThe Jew is not really anti-moral. But, none the less, he does not represent the highest ethical type. He is rather non- moral, neither good nor bad. \n\nSo also in the case of the woman...\n\n...In the Jew and the woman, good and evil are not distinct from one another.\n\nJews, then, do not live as free, self-governing individuals, choosing between virtue and vice in the Aryan fashion...\n\nAccordingly, Weininger's views are considered an important step in attempts to exclude women and Jews from society based on methodical philosophy, in an era declaring human equality and scientific thought. \n\nIn her book \"Nazi Ideology Prior to 1933\", Barbara Miller Lane shows how Nazi ideologists such as Dietrich Eckart disregarded Weininger's distancing of himself from accusations against individual Jews, and instead simply stated that Jews, like women, lacked a soul and a belief in immortality, and that \"Aryans\" must guard themselves from \"Jewishness\" within, since this internal \"Jewishness\" is the source of evil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20604482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20604482", "title": "Philosophy in Canada", "text": "Philosophy in Canada\n\nThe study and teaching of philosophy in Canada date from the time of New France. There has since developed no particular \"Canadian\" school of philosophy. Rather, Canadian philosophers have reflected particular views of established European and later American schools of philosophical thought, be it Thomism, Objective Idealism, or Scottish Common Sense Realism. Since the mid-twentieth century the depth and scope of philosophical activity in Canada has increased dramatically. This article focuses on the evolution of epistemology, logic, the philosophy of mind, metaphysics, ethics and metaethics, and continental philosophy in Canada.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, one of the founding institutions of New France, had a profound influence on philosophy in Canada. As early as 1665, philosophy, viewed as the handmaiden of theology, was taught in Quebec at the Jesuit College there and included studies in physics, metaphysics and ethics as well as the works of St. Thomas Aquinas (1224–1274). The Enlightenment, and the arrival of the British after 1759, introduced new ideas into New France, including Cartesian doubt, the atheism of the Enlightenment, and the sovereignty of the polity. A reaction to these ideas ensued, inspired by the French philosopher, Felicite de Lamennais (1782–1854) and was reflected in the works of the colonial philosopher Abbé Jérôme Demers. This reaction initially took the form of an objection to, and refutation of these \"unsettling\" ideas, adopted by other thinkers, such as Pierre du Calvet. After 1840, in Europe as well as New France the reaction of the Catholic Church to the ideas of the Enlightenment, took the form of stronger response that sought to reaffirm the Catholic view and establish a \"Catholic\" philosophy that removed secular uncertainty by reinforcing the place of God at the centre of the daily life. This new philosophy took the form of Thomism, which in many ways is considered the \"French Canadian\" philosophy.\n\nIn the 1920s the study of philosophy was taken up by universities in Quebec, including the University de Montréal in 1921 and Laval University in Quebec in 1935. This development was both inspired by and coincident with the publication in 1931 of the Papal pronouncement, Deus Scientarium, which sought to mobilize science as the basis of faith. The new century was also marked by notable contributions to the study of medieval history and philosophy by Father Ephrem Longpres, the Franciscan medievalist and the Dominican philosophers, including Hermas Bastien, Charles De Koninck, Father Louis Lachance, Father Arcade Monette, Father Julien Péghaire, Father Louis-Marie Regis, and Father Patrice Robert.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, philosophical study was the exclusive domain of the colleges and universities of English speaking British North America and later Canada. Colleges founded during the colonial regime included Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1818, McGill University in Montreal in 1821, the University of Toronto in 1827, Queens University in Kingston, Ontario in 1841 and the University of Ottawa in 1848. The latter part of the nineteenth century witnessed the founding of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg in 1877, l´Université de Montréal and the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario in 1878 and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in 1887. The University of Alberta in Edmonton and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, were both established in 1908. All provided courses in philosophy.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation inspired the first philosophers in English speaking Canada. These scholars all taught at newly created colonial universities, and their studies emphasized the philosophical foundation of religion, in this case Protestantism, the philosophical understanding of the natural world (natural philosophy), and the philosophical basis of political systems. James Beaven's \"Elements of Natural Theology\", which was perhaps the first philosophical work written in English Canada, is an early example.\n\nOther notable contributors to these ideas included John Watson at Queen's University in Kingston and George John Blewett at the University of Toronto. Other philosophers included Richard Maurice Bucke of London, Ontario, John Macdonald at the University of Alberta, Herbert Leslie Stewart at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Rupert Clendon Lodge at the University of Manitoba, and George Sidney Brett and John Irving at the University of Toronto. Many of these figures were influenced by the British idealist tradition, represented by figures such as Bernard Bosanquet and Thomas Hill Green dominant in Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nOf particular note during middle years of the twentieth century was the work of one of Canada's greatest scholars, Harold Innis, of the University of Toronto. Although usually considered an economist and social scientist, his work also reflects an important number of philosophical concepts related to economics and communications. He had a great influence on his colleague Marshall McLuhan.\n\nThe growth and specialization of certain elements of philosophy in Europe, in time lead to their establishment as new disciplines, separate from philosophy. Natural philosophy became the study of physics, moral philosophy evolved into sociology and anthropology and psychology became a branch of study free of the influence of philosophy. These developments were reflected in Canada during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The first full professorships in physics as distinct from natural philosophy were established at Dalhousie, Halifax, in 1879, Toronto, 1887 and McGill, in Montreal in 1890. Although these were mainly teaching positions there was some research activity. At Dalhousie, Professor J.G. MacGregor, the first to hold the position at that university, published about 50 papers during his tenure from 1879 until 1899. Other prominent researchers in the field at this time included H.L. Callendar and E. Rutherford, Macdonald professors of physics at McGill and J.C. McLennan at U of T.\n\nPsychology in Canada was initially considered a part of the discipline of philosophy and university courses were given by members of philosophy departments. The first course in psychology in Canada was taught at Dalhousie University in 1838 by Thomas McCulloch within the framework of studies in philosophy. By 1866 Dalhousie hosted a chair in psychology and metaphysics. McGill offered courses beginning in 1850 when lectures in the topic were presented by Professor W.T.Leach with a doctorate from Edinburgh. The first psychology text written in Canada was penned by William Lyall of Halifax in 1855. However, by the end of the century psychology was still considered an adjunct to philosophy, not a subject of importance per se, but rather a prerequisite for the advanced study of ethics and metaphysics.\n\nPsychology slowly began to make its mark as a separate discipline in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The oldest Psychology Department in North America was founded at the University of Toronto by Professor Mark Baldwin in 1892 along with a related laboratory in psychology. It was here in 1909, that August Kirschmann, who had studied under Professor Wundt at his famous laboratory in Leipzig, undertook the first fundamental psychological research in Canada and presented seminars on the, \"new psychology\". Dr. E.A. Brett a noted philosopher at U of T, wrote the three volume \"History of Psychology\" between 1912 and 1921. McGill established a psychological laboratory under the directorship of Professor William Dunlop Tait in 1910, followed by the creation of a psychology department separate from philosophy in 1922. McMaster employed a professor in psychology by 1890. The First World War had an important positive effect on the discipline which was recognized for its use in the fields of personnel selection, training and the post-war rehabilitation of wounded soldiers.\n\nIn the years following World War I, the number of staff at the U of T increased to seven and important research was undertaken by Dr. E.A. Bott relating to the rehabilitation of soldiers with muscular disabilities. By 1927 the psychology department at U of T had achieved full independence from the bonds of the department of philosophy. During this period Hans Selye undertook fundamental studies of stress which cut across the boundaries of medical research, biology and psychology. He began his work at McGill in 1936 and continued his investigations at the University of Montreal starting in 1945. He described the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as the body's mechanism for coping with stress and published a number of books including \"The Stress of Life\" in 1953.\n\nWhile still under the influence of the departments of philosophy, noted philosophers such as John Watson at Queens, John MacEachran at Alberta, William Caldwell at McGill and G.S Brett at U of T, championed the recognition of psychology as a discipline in its own right, leading to the creation of separate departments of philosophy and psychology in many universities. By the end of the thirties the growth of the discipline was sufficient to warrant the establishment of the Canadian Psychological Association in 1939. The discipline of sociology evolved from the ideas of philosophers Auguste Comte and Émile Durkheim in France in the nineteenth century. However it was not until 1922 that Carl A. Dawson was appointed Canada's first professor of sociology at McGill. Honours programmes in sociology were established at McGill in 1926 and at the University of Toronto in 1932. Anthropology evolved from a long history of interest in Canada's native peoples on the part of Jesuit missionaries, explorers and university professors including Sir Daniel Wilson at the University of Toronto and Sir John William Dawson at McGill and the inspiration provided by moral philosophy. Professional anthropology got its start in Canada in 1910 when Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier established the Division of Anthropology as a part of the Geological Survey of Canada.\n\nStudies in this field have often focused on the philosophy of psychology. Important work in this area has been done in Canada, particularly at the Centre for Cognitive Science at the University of Western Ontario by, Patricia and Paul Churchland, Zenon Pylyshyn, and Ausonio Marras in the early eighties.\n\nStudies in logic have been undertaken by a number of individuals. Bas Van Fraassen, William Rozeboom and Alasdair Urquhart have specialized in the semantics of logic, while Hans Herzberger and William Harper have studied the nature of preference. John Woods has investigated concepts relating to relevance and paradox. Others have made contributions to the field, including Charles Morgan (modal logics), Charles Morgan (probability semantics), and Anil Gupta (the semantics of truth and paradoxes).\n\nAll Group of Thirteen have departments of philosophy with doctorate-level staff members conducting research related to the philosophy of mind. The work of Dr. Paul R. Thagard, at the University of Waterloo, with respect to cognitive functions and coherence, is of note. Charles Taylor, emeritus professor at McGill University in Montreal, has studied consciousness within the context of Hegelianism. Zenon Pylyshyn a psychologist and computer scientist at the University of Western Ontario from 1964 to 1994, has made significant contributions to cognitive science. Other Canadian-born and educated cognitive scientists have made their mark in the US, including David Kirsh, John Robert Anderson, Keith Holyoak, and Steven Pinker.\n\nMetaphysics deals with the study of the nature of reality. Since the Enlightenment, reality has been seen through the lenses of both religion and science, and frequently there has been a conflict between the views of the two. Following the horrors of the Second World War, the attacks on the views of religion became particularly vigorous with science on the offensive.\n\nCanadian philosophers in the postwar era have attempted, in a number of ways, to resolve these conflicts and to legitimize religious belief. A variety of approaches have been used. Some have stressed the similarities between religion and science, as have F.W. Waters (1967) and Alastair McKinnon (1970). Others, including Lionel Rubinoff, have emphasized the importance of placing our scientific view of the world in a larger human context. There have been attempts to resolve the conflict, through science, as seen in the writings of Charles De Koninck (1960), Thomas Goudge (1961), and A.H. Johnson (1962). Others have attempted to argue the rational nature of religious belief. Some, inspired by St. Thomas Aquinas, include Bernard Lonergan (1952), Louis-Marie Régis (1959), Joseph Owens (1968), Jean-Louis Allard (1979, 1982), and Lawrence Dewan, OP. More general approaches defending the reasonability of religion have been taken by Leslie Armour and William Sweet. Still others have attempted to address issues in the philosophy of religion by questioning underlying issues in metaphysics. Those following this approach within the analytic tradition include Kai Nielsen, Donald Evans (1963), Terence Penelhum (1970), Alistair M. Macleod (1973), and Jay Newman (1986). Phenomenology has also played a role, as seen in the work of Emil Fackenheim (1961), Benoit Pruche (1977–1980), René l'Ecuyer (1980), Jacques Croteau (1981), Cyril Welch (1982), Gary Madison (1988), Hendrik Hart (1990), Jean Grondin (1995), and Thomas De Koninck (1995).\n\nEthics is the study of questions concerning the nature of right and wrong and good and bad as they relate to human conduct. In many cases, the aim is to use philosophy to make our world and society a better place. Work in the field has grown in the postwar years. Research has been undertaken by a large number of individuals including Francis Sparshott, Kai Nielsen, David Braybrooke, Jonathan Bennett, Gerald Cohen, Donald Brown, Daniel Weinstock, William Sweet, Charles Taylor. Wayne Sumner has been active in the field of applied philosophy. Real Fillion has brought together philosophy and politics in his original work in multiculturalism.\n\nThe minority position of the French language and culture in Canada and North America is reflected in the preoccupation of a large number of French Canadian philosophers with metaethics. Fernand Dumont, Claude Savary, Jacques Grand'Maison, Michel Morin, Claude Bertrand, Joseph Pestieau, Ferdinand Dumond, Guy Laforest, Louis Balthazar, Vincent Lemieux, Guy Laforest, François Blais, Diane Lamoureux, Michel Seymour, Gerard Bergeron, Maurice Lagueux, Jean Guy Meunier, Serge Cantin, Jean Roy, Guy Lafrance, Roger Lambert, Dominique Leydet, Gilles Labelle, Yvonne Thériault, Guy Lafrance, Josiane Ayoub, Pierre Robert, Bjarne Melkevik, and Philip Knee have made important contributions. They may be considered the secular descendants of their Thomist ancestors Of particular interest is the work of the economist and Thomist philosopher Bernard Lonergan, as reflected in \"Insight: A Study of Human Understanding\" (1957), and \"Method in Theology\" (1972), which described his . His writings are the subject of a 25 volume collection being edited by the University of Toronto Press.\n\nEuropean philosophers of the 20th century launched a number of philosophical movements that were revolutionary both within philosophy and in the larger culture. These movements—phenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction—were often not well received in North American universities, but they have been a regular and growing part of the philosophical landscape of North America since the 1950s, and Canadian universities have played an important role in the development and dissemination of these philosophical ideas. In the 1970s and 1980s, the University of Toronto in particular was internationally known for its experts in what is often called \"continental philosophy\". Emil Fackenheim, Kenneth L. Schmitz, Graeme Nicholson, and others made the University of Toronto an international centre for the study of these approaches to philosophical inquiry. At the same time Graeme Nicholson's teacher James Doull, a Hegelian whom Emil Fackenheim notably debated in print on matters relating to the interpretation of Hegel, taught philosophy as well as classical literature in the Classics Department at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Currently, the University of Toronto, with scholars such as Robert Gibbs and Rebecca Comay , Ryerson University in Toronto, with Kym Maclaren, John Caruana, David Ciavatta, and Paula Schwebel, the University of Guelph, with John Russon, and McGill University, with scholars such as Philip Buckley, George Di Giovanni, Hasana Sharp and Alia Al-Saji, are major North American centers for research and teaching in the continental traditions of philosophy.\n\nThese years saw Canadian philosophy develop to the point where a professional organization, The Canadian Philosophical Association (ACPA), was established in 1958 to encourage and promote philosophy in Canada. This was followed by the founding of regional associations in Ontario, Quebec, the west and Atlantic Canada, and the initiation of the Canadian Philosophical Association Annual Congress. The professional journal, \"\" was established in 1962, and the \"Canadian Journal of Philosophy\" in 1971. Philosophers of note who have been published there include, Joel Feinberg (1974), Jonathan Bennett (philosopher) (1974), Terence Parsons (1980), William C. Wimsatt (1994) and David Gauthier (1994).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55363494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55363494", "title": "Postcolonial theology", "text": "Postcolonial theology\n\nPostcolonial theology is the application of postcolonial criticism to Christian theology. As is in postcolonial discourse, the term \"postcolonial\" is used without a hyphen, denoting an intellectual reaction against the colonial, instead of being merely sequential to it.\n\nPostcolonial theologians argue that, in the past, the dominant Western form of Christianity is actually determined, shaped, and defined by European colonialism, implying and reinforcing notions such as Eurocentrism, colonial exploitation, and the superiority of European values and culture. Therefore, critical examination is needed, and alternative interpretations to colonially-tainted narratives need to be constructed. This is done by \"revisiting the question of how indigenous cultures can contribute to theology and biblical studies\".\n\nAlthough decolonization took place shortly after the Second World War, postcolonial theories did not emerge until the late 1970s. The field of postcolonial theology, correspondingly, did not arise until the 1990s.\n\nNotable biblical scholars include R. S. Sugirtharajah and Fernando Segovia and theologians include Musa W. Dube, Wong Wai-ching Angela, Kwok Pui-lan, and Mayra Rivera.\n\nGiven its similarities with literary analysis, it is not surprising that biblical studies was the first field within Christian studies to apply postcolonial criticism. Adopting postcolonial critical methods, biblical studies is inspired to take into account issues of \"expansion, domination, and imperialism\" in examining existing biblical interpretation, and in constructing new narratives. Indigenous non-Western approaches to theologizing the Bible, previously neglected under the colonial context \"in favor of European methods\", are now revisited, in hope to \"make the Bible comprehensible to the colonized cultures on their own terms\". Therefore, traditional fields of translation, exegesis, and hermeneutics in biblical studies have to be reconsidered in light of postcolonial criticism, and non-Western perspectives have to be taken into account, even as focal points.\n\nAmong various scholars, R. S. Sugirtharajah, one of the principal advocates of postcolonial biblical studies, outlined in his book \"The Bible and the Third World\" three hermeneutic approaches which emerged after colonialism: the native or vernacular approach, the liberation approach, and the postcolonial approach.\n\nThere are certain benefits of applying postcolonial criticism to biblical studies. First, it opens up potential areas and possibilities for interdisciplinary work, enriching the discipline by enabling multiple approaches to bring in their insights. Second, it allows for criticism towards the way things are done, including the principles and presuppositions of the field. In addition, it also avoids detachment from the contemporary world, as work done in the discipline would have to respond to postcolonial contexts.\n\nReviewing Christian history from a postcolonial critical perspective, history is realized to be intrinsically more than just impartial facts. As history is essentially a narrative of what happened, it is always an interpretation, which is \"bound by time, place, and the social, political, religious, cultural and economic positions of writers\", and a representation, being an \"interested construction of representation through which power is expressed, reflected, and exercised.\"\n\nPostcolonial historical methods, therefore, begins with tracing the development of the dominant narrative, followed by a critical reassessment of the sources and the historiography of the mainstream narrative, and finally teasing out the colonial taints and construct new, alternative narratives. This is especially relevant in the history of churches in which missionary work has been heavily involved, as such historiographies tend to have more difficulty in treating Western engagement and local churches from an egalitarian perspective.\n\nAs such, postcolonial criticism contributes to the discipline by putting forth a recognition that current narratives are, or at least are likely to be, shaped by the colonial context. This leads to the awareness that there could be, and should be, alternative representations of those parts of history. Biased historical readings are therefore prevented or at least reduced. \n\nGiven the short history of engaging with postcolonial criticism, postcolonial theology as a field of study is still \"in its infancy.\" It is argued by R. S. Sugirtharajah that its development is further held back by Western reluctance to analyse the theological implications of colonial imperialism.\n\nHowever, theologians from the colonized non-West such as C. S. Song and Chung Hyun Kyung have long been theologizing with reflection or even resistance against the colonizing West. Interpreted from the perspective of postcolonial criticism, these theologies could be retrospectively categorized as postcolonial theology. Geographically, they could also be conceptualized according to the three main continents, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Regional theologies are also influenced by other intellectual trends, such as liberation theology or feminist theology.\n\nIn Africa, theology is often articulated in one of two aspects: inculturation and liberation. The former is often described as \"African theology\", which is a term first appeared in 1965 at the All Africa Conference of Churches, and could be identified as \"an attempt by Africans to give theological articulation to their spiritual, political, and economic struggles.\" The latter is a form of liberation theology and also has an interesting relationship with black theology in North America. This would later influence South African theology, especially during and after Apartheid.\n\nAsian theology could be understood to be inherently postcolonial, as it has moved towards a \"discontinuity with Western theology and denounced the usefulness of a theology that allied itself with colonial powers and their dominance.\" This resonates with the strong currents of nationalism. However, since Asian churches have historically been considered under colonial authorities, theologians have had to wrestle with the tension (or even conflict) between religious and national identity. In addition, its focal points include indigenization, liberation from poverty, as well as practical commitment in engaging with the praxis of reality. Hence, the influence of liberation theology is easily notable. \n\nAsian local theologies include Dalit theology in South Asia, Minjung theology in South Korea, and Burakumin theology in Japan.\n\nThe Latin American church has been famous for their liberation theology, which influenced numerous theological trends worldwide. It is arguably the earliest postcolonial resistance to western dominance. In comparison, it seems more politically minded, and less concerned in formulating an inculturated theology. Inspired in the 1950s within the Roman Catholic Church, it critiques the colonial situation in three ways, addressing how oppression was structurally enforced by the authorities, complicit by the church, and internalized by the oppressed themselves. \n\n"}

In the Vedas, which teach the aspirant how to rise in moral and spiritual stature in preparation of attainment of liberation through a combination of works and knowledge, the supreme Reality is referred to as – परम् (parama) which means beyond, सत्यम् (satyama) which means truth, ऋतम् (ritama) which means right or righteousness, and बृहत् (brihata) which means vast or great. Praying to the Ashwins, a Rishi (Rig Veda X.24.6) hopefully asks -\n\n\"Both of you are divine, with your divinity purify us so that our efforts to gain emancipation and emancipation itself are both pleasant, and pleasant also is our return from the beyond.\"\n\nTherefore, a Rishi also prays (Rig Veda X.105.9)\n\n\"May we attain in the form of a boat that which is the glorious power generated by His actions, that power which fills up and thrills the entire three worlds, the power that lifts upwards the created objects, that power which is at once the very basis of life and the impelling force.\" \n\nRishi Vashishta (Rig Veda IX.67.21) asks the Great Purifier (पवमान) to destroy for all times (विजहि) all obstacles that are near and far, and all fears that are within us. Rishi Medhatithi (Rig Veda I.15.11) tells us that the intelligent and learned persons must know the Sun shining on its own and the Moon shining brightly in the light of the Sun, both associated with light, and with Agni which purifies and partakes the oblations offered to it. Prasna Upanishad (I.7) explains that Agni which in its material form is identified with the gross self is the Taijasa when in meditation the mind settles inwards, projects impressions and remaining unconnected with the senses is not conscious of the gross body, it then becomes identified as Vaishvanara, the subtle self identified with the mind, the subtle instrument which shines as well as reflects. The mind is the seat of the Intelect, and it is Agni that purifies the mind; a pure mind protects itself, becomes truly invulnerable, and develops super-consciousness and vision which is Samadhi in which state one sees the inner brightness also shining without everywhere.\n\nThe bright entity at the centre of the yajna of creation is the self-effulgent immortal single Reality who is the light of all lights; the sun signifies Agni and Agni signifies the Almighty Creator. Therefore, a Rishi (Rig Veda X.35.5) prays – स्वस्त्यग्निं समिधानमीमहे – \"May we know Agni in the form of the brightly shining Sun for our own benefits\". Rishi Kavi (Rig Veda IX.77.2) declares – स पूर्ण्यः पवते – that the Eternal Being, the Creator, purifies all beings. The Eternal Being purifies by eliminating Rajoguna from our systems, eliminating the same Rajoguna from which all matter was made. Prakṛti is a mixture of three gunas but the Atman, which is naturally and eternally liberated, is devoid of association with the gunas because of which fact bliss is not moksha and not the dharma of the Atman. Prana, the vital force and the body of the mind and having the power of manifesting itself and becoming active in its own spheres, is Agni, and also the principle of consciousness as the ultimate reality – प्राणो ह्येवैतानि सर्वाणि भवति (Chandogya Upanishad V.1.15) the purification of the mind is dependent upon the Pranas. It is only when the mind is purified after an initial control of the Pranas that the Atman reveals itself (Mundaka Upanishad III.1.9). Thus, the Rishis of the Rig Veda (IX.24.1-2) tell us -\n\nthat the pleasing (सोमासः) gunas of the Pramatman purify (पवमानासः) men who with the aid of (श्रीणानाः) the body, mind and speech attain purification (मृञ्जत), and that the senses and the sense-organs (गावः) once purified certainly come to the aid of the karma-yogis in realizing Brahman (इन्दम् आशत).\n"}
{"id": "207360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207360", "title": "Reichstag fire", "text": "Reichstag fire\n\nThe Reichstag fire (, ) was an arson attack on the Reichstag building (home of the German parliament) in Berlin on 27 February 1933, one month after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany. Hitler's government stated that Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch council communist, was found near the building and attributed the fire to communist agitators in general—though in 1933, a German court decided that van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed. After the fire, the Reichstag Fire Decree was passed. The Nazi Party used the fire as evidence that communists were plotting against the German government, and the event is considered pivotal in the establishment of Nazi Germany. The term Reichstag fire has come to refer to false flag actions perpetrated or facilitated by an authority to promote their own interests through popular approval of retribution or retraction of civil rights. \n\nThe fire started in the Reichstag building, the assembly location of the German Parliament. A Berlin fire station received an alarm call that the building was on fire shortly after 21:00. By the time the police and firefighters arrived, the main Chamber of Deputies was engulfed in flames. The police conducted a thorough search inside the building and found van der Lubbe. He was arrested, as were four communist leaders soon after. Hitler urged President Paul von Hindenburg to pass an emergency decree to suspend civil liberties and pursue a \"ruthless confrontation\" with the Communist Party of Germany. After passing the decree, the government instituted mass arrests of communists, including all of the Communist Party parliamentary delegates. With their bitter rival communists gone and their seats empty, the Nazi Party went from being a plurality party to the majority, thus enabling Hitler to consolidate his power. \n\nIn February 1933, three men were arrested who were to play pivotal roles during the Leipzig Trial, known also as the \"Reichstag Fire Trial\": Bulgarians Georgi Dimitrov, Vasil Tanev and Blagoy Popov. The Bulgarians were known to the Prussian police as senior Comintern operatives, but the police had no idea how senior they were: Dimitrov was head of all Comintern operations in Western Europe. The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains an ongoing topic of debate and research. Historians disagree as to whether van der Lubbe acted alone, as he said, to protest the condition of the German working class. The Nazis accused the Comintern of the act. Some historians endorse the theory, initially proposed by the Communist Party, that the arson was planned and ordered by the Nazis as a false flag operation. The building remained in its fire-damaged state until it was partially repaired from 1961 to 1964, then completely restored from 1995 to 1999.\n\nHitler was sworn in as Chancellor and head of the coalition government on 30 January 1933. As Chancellor, Hitler asked German President Paul von Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag and call for a new parliamentary election. The date set for the elections was 5 March 1933. Hitler's aim was first to acquire a National Socialist majority, to secure his position and to remove the communist opposition. If prompted or desired, the President could remove the Chancellor. Hitler hoped to abolish democracy in a more or less legal fashion, by passing the Enabling Act. The Enabling Act was a special law that gave the Chancellor the power to pass laws by decree, without the involvement of the \"Reichstag\". These special powers would remain in effect for four years, after which time they were eligible to be renewed. Under the Weimar Constitution, the President could rule by decree in times of emergency using Article 48. The unprecedented element of the Enabling Act was that the Chancellor possessed the powers. An Enabling Act was only supposed to be passed in times of extreme emergency and had only been used once, in 1923–24 when the government used an Enabling Act to end hyperinflation (see hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic). To pass an Enabling Act, a party required a vote by a two-thirds majority in the \"Reichstag\". In January 1933, the Nazis had only 32% of the seats.\n\nDuring the election campaign, the Nazis alleged that Germany was on the verge of a Communist revolution and that the only way to stop the Communists was to pass the Enabling Act. The message of the campaign was simple: increase the number of Nazi seats so that the Enabling Act could be passed. To decrease the number of opposition members of parliament who could vote against the Enabling Act, Hitler planned to ban the \"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands\" (the Communist Party of Germany or \"KPD\"), which at the time held 17% of the seats, after the elections and before the new \"Reichstag\" convened.\n\nShortly after 21:00 on 27 February 1933, the Berlin Fire Department received a message that the \"Reichstag\" was on fire. Despite the best efforts of the firefighters, most of the building was gutted by the blaze. By 23:30, the fire was put out. The firefighters and police inspected the ruins and found twenty bundles of flammable material (firelighters) unburned lying about. At the time the fire was reported, Adolf Hitler was having dinner with Joseph Goebbels at Goebbels' apartment in Berlin. When Goebbels received an urgent phone call informing him of the fire, he regarded it as a \"tall tale\" at first and hung up. Only after the second call did he report the news to Hitler. Both left Goebbels' apartment and arrived by car at the \"Reichstag\", just as the fire was being put out. They were met at the site by Hermann Göring who told Hitler, \"This is Communist outrage! One of the Communist culprits has been arrested.\" Hitler called the fire a \"sign from God\" and claimed it was a \"Fanal\" (signal) meant to mark the beginning of a Communist \"Putsch\" (revolt). The next day, the \"Preussische Pressedienst\" (Prussian Press Service) reported that \"this act of incendiarism is the most monstrous act of terrorism carried out by Bolshevism in Germany\". The \"Vossische Zeitung\" newspaper warned its readers that \"the government is of the opinion that the situation is such that a danger to the state and nation existed and still exists\".\n\nThe day after the fire, at Hitler's request, President Hindenburg signed the Reichstag Fire Decree into law by using Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. The Reichstag Fire Decree suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, the right of free association and public assembly, the secrecy of the post and telephone. These rights were not reinstated during Nazi reign. The decree was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered \"friendly\" to the Nazi cause. Despite the fact that Marinus van der Lubbe claimed to have acted alone in the Reichstag fire, Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a Communist plot to take over Germany. Nazi newspapers blared this \"news\". This sent the Germans into a panic and isolated the Communists further among the civilians; additionally, thousands of Communists were imprisoned in the days following the fire (including leaders of the Communist Party of Germany) on the charge that the Party was preparing to stage a \"putsch\". Speaking to Rudolph Diels about Communists during the Reichstag fire, Hitler said \"These sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses.\" With Communist electoral participation also suppressed (the Communists previously polled 17% of the vote), the Nazis were able to increase their share of the vote in the 5 March 1933, \"Reichstag\" elections from 33% to 44%. This gave the Nazis and their allies, the German National People's Party (who won 8% of the vote), a majority of 52% in the \"Reichstag\".\n\nWhile the Nazis emerged with a majority, they fell short of their goal, which was to win 50%–55% of the vote that year. The Nazis thought that this would make it difficult to achieve their next goal, which was to pass the Enabling Act, a measure that required a two-thirds majority. However, there were important factors weighing in the Nazis' favor. These were: the continued suppression of the Communist Party and the Nazis' ability to capitalize on national security concerns. Moreover, some deputies of the Social Democratic Party (the only party that would vote against the Enabling Act) were prevented from taking their seats in the \"Reichstag\", due to arrests and intimidation by the Nazi SA. As a result, the Social Democratic Party would be under-represented in the final vote tally. The Enabling Act, which gave Hitler the right to rule by decree, passed easily on 23 March 1933. It garnered the support of the right-wing German National People's Party, the Centre Party, and several fragmented middle-class parties. This measure went into force on 27 March and, in effect, made Hitler dictator of Germany.\n\nThe Kroll Opera House, sitting across the \"Königsplatz\" from the burned-out Reichstag building, functioned as the Reichstag's venue for the remaining twelve years of the Third Reich's existence.\n\nIn July 1933, Marinus van der Lubbe, Ernst Torgler, Georgi Dimitrov, Blagoi Popov, and Vasil Tanev were indicted on charges of setting the \"Reichstag\" on fire. From 21 September to 23 December 1933, the Leipzig Trial took place and was presided over by judges from the German Supreme Court, the \"Reichsgericht\". This was Germany's highest court. The presiding judge was Judge Dr. Wilhelm Bürger of the Fourth Criminal Court of the Fourth Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court. The accused were charged with arson and with attempting to overthrow the government.\nThe Leipzig Trial was widely publicized and was broadcast on the radio. It was expected that the court would find the Communists guilty on all counts and approve the repression and terror exercised by the Nazis against all opposition forces in the country. At the end of the trial, however, only Van der Lubbe was convicted, while his fellow defendants were found not guilty. In 1934, Van der Lubbe was beheaded in a German prison yard. In 1967, a court in West Berlin overturned the 1933 verdict, and posthumously changed Van der Lubbe's sentence to 8 years in prison. In 1980, another court overturned the verdict, but was overruled. In 1981, a West German court posthumously overturned Van der Lubbe's 1933 conviction and found him not guilty by reason of insanity. This ruling was subsequently overturned. However, in January 2008, he was pardoned under a 1998 law for the crime on the grounds that anyone convicted under Nazi Germany is officially not guilty. The law allows pardons for people convicted of crimes under the Nazis, based on the idea that the laws of Nazi Germany \"went against the basic ideas of justice\".\n\nThe trial began at 8:45 on the morning of 21 September, with Van der Lubbe testifying. Van der Lubbe's testimony was very hard to follow as he spoke of losing his sight in one eye and wandering around Europe as a drifter and that he had been a member of the Dutch Communist Party, which he quit in 1931, but still considered himself a communist. Georgi Dimitrov began his testimony on the third day of the trial. He gave up his right to a court-appointed lawyer and defended himself successfully. When warned by Judge Bürger to behave himself in court, Dimitrov stated: \"Herr President, if you were a man as innocent as myself and you had passed seven months in prison, five of them in chains night and day, you would understand it if one perhaps becomes a little strained.\" During the course of his defence, Dimitrov claimed that the organizers of the fire were senior members of the Nazi Party and frequently verbally clashed with Göring at the trial. The highpoint of the trial occurred on 4 November 1933, when Göring took the stand and was cross-examined by Dimitrov. The following exchange took place:\n\nIn his verdict, Judge Bürger was careful to underline his belief that there had in fact been a Communist conspiracy to burn down the \"Reichstag\", but declared, with the exception of Van der Lubbe, there was insufficient evidence to connect the accused to the fire or the alleged conspiracy. Only Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death. The rest were acquitted and were expelled to the Soviet Union, where they received a heroic welcome. The one exception was Torgler, who was taken into \"protective custody\" by the police until 1935. After being released, he assumed a pseudonym and moved away from Berlin.\n\nHitler was furious with the outcome of this trial. He decreed that henceforth treason—among many other offenses—would only be tried by a newly established People's Court (\"Volksgerichtshof\"). The People's Court later became associated with the number of death sentences it handed down, including those following the 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler, which were presided over by then Judge-President Roland Freisler.\n\nAt his trial, Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was beheaded by guillotine (the customary form of execution in Saxony at the time; it was by axe in the rest of Germany) on 10 January 1934, three days before his 25th birthday. The Nazis alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of the Communist conspiracy to burn down the \"Reichstag\" and seize power, while the Communists alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of the Nazi conspiracy to blame the crime on them. Van der Lubbe, for his part, maintained that he acted alone to protest the condition of the German working class.\n\nAccording to Ian Kershaw, in \"Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris\", written in 1998, the consensus of nearly all historians at the time of writing was that Van der Lubbe did set the \"Reichstag\" on fire, and that it was generally believed that he acted alone and that the \"Reichstag\" fire was merely a stroke of good luck for the Nazis. Although Van der Lubbe was certainly an arsonist and clearly played a role, there has been considerable popular and scientific debate over whether he acted alone; the case is still discussed.\n\nIt is alleged that the idea Van der Lubbe was a \"half-wit\" or \"mentally disturbed\" was propaganda spread by the Dutch Communist Party, to distance themselves from an insurrectionist anti-fascist, who was once a member of the party and took action where they failed to do so. John Gunther, who covered the trial, described him as \"an obvious victim of manic-depressive psychosis\", and said that the Nazis would not have chosen \"an agent so inept and witless\". Citing a letter allegedly written by Karl Ernst before his death during the Night of Long Knives, he believed that Nazis who heard Van der Lubbe boast of planning to attack the Reichstag started a second simultaneous fire they blamed on him. Hans Mommsen concluded that the Nazi leadership was in a state of panic on the night of the \"Reichstag\" fire and they seemed to regard the fire as confirmation that a Communist revolution was as imminent as they said it was.\n\nBritish reporter Sefton Delmer witnessed the events of that night and his account of the fire provides a number of details. Delmer reports Hitler arriving at the \"Reichstag\" and appearing uncertain how it began and concerned that a Communist coup was about to be launched. Delmer viewed Van der Lubbe as being solely responsible but that the Nazis sought to make it appear to be a \"Communist gang\" who set the fire, whereas the Communists sought to make it appear that Van der Lubbe was working for the Nazis, each side constructing a plot-theory in which the other was the villain.\n\nIn private, Hitler said of the chairman of the Communist Party, Ernst Torgler: \"I'm convinced he was responsible for the burning of the Reichstag, but I can't prove it\".\n\nIn 1960, , a West German SPD public servant and part-time historian, published a series of articles in \"Der Spiegel\", later turned into a book, in which he argued that Vаn der Lubbe acted alone. Tobias was widely attacked for his articles, which showed that Van der Lubbe was a pyromaniac, with a long history of burning down buildings or attempting to burn down buildings. Tobias established that Van der Lubbe attempted to burn down several buildings in the days prior to 27 February. In March 1973, the Swiss historian Walter Hofer organized a conference intended to rebut the claims made by Tobias. At the conference, Hofer claimed to have found evidence that some of the detectives who investigated the fire had been Nazis. Mommsen commented on Hofer's claims by stating, \"Professor Hofer's rather helpless statement that the accomplices of Van der Lubbe 'could only have been Nazis' is tacit admission that the committee did not actually obtain any positive evidence in regard to the alleged accomplices' identity.\" Mommsen also had a counter-study supporting Hofer, which was suppressed for political reasons, an act that he admits was a serious breach of ethics.\n\nIn 1946, Hans Gisevius a member of anti-Hitler resistance within the German government and former member of the Gestapo, Abwehr, and foreign ministry, indicated his supposition that the Nazis were the arsonists. Gisevius posits that Karl Ernst by order of possibly Goebbels, collected a commando of SA men headed by Hans Georg \"Heini\" Gewehr, who set the fire. Among them was a criminal named Rall, who later made a (suppressed) confession before he was murdered by the Gestapo. Almost all participants were murdered in the Night of the Long Knives; Gewehr survived this purge but was later reported, inaccurately, to have died in the war. Gewehr actually lived until 1976 and was involved in much of the post-war controversy about the origins of the fire.\n\nNew work by Bahar and Kugel, as of 2001, has revived the theory that the Nazis were behind the fire. It uses Gestapo archives held in Moscow and available to researchers only since 1990. They argue that the fire was almost certainly started by the Nazis, based on the wealth of circumstantial evidence provided by the archival material. They say that a commando group of at least three and at most ten SA men, led by Hans Georg Gewehr, set the fire using self-lighting incendiaries, and that Van der Lubbe was brought to the scene later. \"Der Spiegel\" published a 10-page response to the book, arguing that the thesis that Van der Lubbe acted alone remains the most likely explanation. 's 2014 study rejects the possibility of a single perpetrator, van der Lubbe, as he had neither time nor appropriate resources for a successful arson attack.\n\nIn \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\", William L. Shirer wrote that at Nuremberg, General Franz Halder stated in an affidavit, that Hermann Göring boasted about setting the fire:\nOn the occasion of a lunch on the Führer's birthday in 1943, the people around the Führer turned the conversation to the Reichstag building and its artistic value. I heard with my own ears how Göring broke into the conversation and shouted: 'The only one who really knows about the Reichstag building is I, for I set fire to it.' And saying this he slapped his thigh.\nUnder cross-examination at the Nuremberg trial in 1945/6, Göring was read Halder's affidavit and denied he had any involvement in the fire, characterizing Halder's statement as \"utter nonsense\". Göring stated:\nI had no reason or motive for setting fire to the \"Reichstag\". From the artistic point of view I did not at all regret that the assembly chamber was burned; I hoped to build a better one. But I did regret very much that I was forced to find a new meeting place for the \"Reichstag\" and, not being able to find one, I had to give up my Kroll Opera House ... for that purpose. The opera seemed to me much more important than the \"Reichstag\".\n\nDuring the summer of 1933, a mock counter-trial was organised in London by a group of lawyers, democrats and other anti-Nazis under the aegis of German Communist émigrés. The chairman of the mock trial was Labour barrister (and Stalin apologist) D N Pritt KC and the chief organiser was the KPD propaganda chief Willi Münzenberg. The other \"judges\" were Meester Piet Vermeylen of Belgium, George Branting of Sweden, Maître Vincent de Moro-Giafferi and Maître Gaston Bergery of France, Betsy Bakker-Nort of the Netherlands, Vald Hvidt of Denmark and Arthur Garfield Hays of the United States.\n\nThe mock trial began on 21 September 1933. It lasted one week and ended with the conclusion that the defendants were innocent and the true initiators of the fire were to be found amid the leading Nazi Party elite. The counter-trial received much media attention and Sir Stafford Cripps delivered the opening speech. Göring was found guilty at the mock counter-trial. The mock trial served as a workshop, during which all possible scenarios were tested and all speeches of the defendants were prepared. Most of the \"judges\", such as Hays and Moro-Giafferi, complained that the atmosphere at the \"Counter-trial\" was more like a show trial, with Münzenberg constantly applying pressure behind the scenes on the \"judges\", to deliver the \"right\" verdict without any regard for the truth. One of the \"witnesses\", a supposed SA man, appeared in court wearing a mask and claimed that it was the SA that really set the fire; in fact, the \"SA man\" was Albert Norden, the editor of the German Communist newspaper \"Rote Fahne\". Another masked witness whom Hays described as \"not very reliable\", claimed that Van der Lubbe was a drug-addicted homosexual, who was the lover of Ernst Röhm and a Nazi dupe. When the lawyer for Ernst Torgler, asked the mock trial organisers to turn over the \"evidence\" exonerating his client, Münzenberg refused the request because he lacked any \"evidence\" to exonerate or convict anyone of the crime. The counter-trial was an enormously successful publicity stunt for the German Communists. Münzenberg followed this triumph with another by writing under his name, the best-selling \"The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror\", an exposé of what Münzenberg alleged to be the Nazi conspiracy to burn down the Reichstag and blame the act on the Communists. (As with all of Münzenberg's books, the real author was one of his aides; in this case, a Czechoslovak Communist named Otto Katz.) The success of \"The Brown Book\" was followed by another best-seller published in 1934, again ghost-written by Katz, \"The Second Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and the Hitler Terror\".\n\n\"The Brown Book\" was divided into three parts. The first part, which traced the rise of the Nazis (or \"German Fascists\" as Katz called them, in conformity with Comintern practice, which forbade the use of the term Nazi), portrayed the KPD as the only genuine anti-fascist force in Germany and featured a bitter attack on the SPD. Formed from dissidents within the SPD, the KPD led the communist uprisings in the early Weimar period—which the SPD crushed. \"The Brown Book\" labelled the SPD \"Social Fascists\" and accused the leadership of the SPD of secretly working with the Nazis. The second section deals with the \"Reichstag\" fire, which is described as a Nazi plot to frame the Communists, who are represented as the most dedicated opponents of Nazism. The third section deals with the supposed puppet masters behind the Nazis.\n\nThe term \"Reichstag fire\" is used by some writers to denote a calamitous event staged by a political movement, orchestrated in a manner that casts blame on their opponents, thus causing the opponents to be viewed with suspicion by the general public. This is sometimes known as a false flag attack when the event itself is caused by proponents of a political movement to falsely accuse their opponents. In modern histories the destruction of the palace of Diocletian at Nicomedia has been described as a \"fourth-century Reichstag fire\" used to justify an extensive persecution of Christians. According to Lactantius, \"That might urge [Diocletian] to excess of cruelty in persecution, he employed private emissaries to set the palace on fire; and some part of it having been burnt, the blame was laid on the Christians as public enemies; and the very appellation of Christian grew odious on account of that fire.\" Tacitus' account of the burning of Rome involved similar allegations.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its epistemic and semiotic role.\n\nSimilarly to cultural studies, science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from scientometrics to ethnomethodology or cognitive science. Science studies have a certain importance for evaluation and science policy. Overlapping with the field of science, technology and society, practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.\n\nThe field started with a tendency toward navel-gazing: it was extremely self-conscious in its genesis and applications. From early concerns with scientific discourse, practitioners soon started to deal with the relation of scientific expertise to politics and lay people. Practical examples include bioethics, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), pollution, global warming, biomedical sciences, physical sciences, natural hazard predictions, the (alleged) impact of the Chernobyl disaster in the UK, generation and review of science policy and risk governance and its historical and geographic contexts. While staying a discipline with multiple metanarratives, the fundamental concern is about the role of the perceived ̳expert‘ in providing governments and local authorities with information from which they can make decisions.\nThe approach poses various important questions about what makes an expert and how experts and their authority are to be distinguished from the lay population and interacts with the values and policy making process in liberal democratic societies.\n\nPractitioners examine the forces within and through which scientists investigate specific phenomena such as\n\nMaria Ossowska and Stanislaw Ossowski started to introduce the concept in the 1930s. Thomas Kuhn's \"Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962) led to an increased interest in not only the history of science, but also its philosophical underpinnings. Kuhn's work established that the history of science was less a linear succession of discoveries, but rather the concept of paradigms to the philosophy of science. Paradigms are broader, socio-intellectual constructs that determine which types of truth claims are permissible. Science studies try to identify crucial dichotomies as in science and technology, nature and culture, theories and experiments; science and fine art leading to the separation of various science fields and practices. Sociology of scientific knowledge developed at the University of Edinburgh, where David Bloor and his colleagues developed what has been termed the 'strong programme'. The strong programme proposed that both 'true' and 'false' scientific theories should be treated the same way. Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest. All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process.\n\nIt proved however difficult to address natural science topics with sociologist methods, as proven by the US science wars. The use of a deconstructive approach (as for works on arts or religion) on natural sciences risked to endanger not only the \"hard facts\" of natural sciences, but as well the objectivity and positivist tradition of sociology itself. The view on scientific knowledge production as a (at least partial) social construct was not easily accepted. Latour and others identified a dichotomy crucial for modernity, the division between nature (things, objects) as being transcendent, allowing to detect them, and society (the subject, the state) as immanent as being artificial, constructed. The dichotomy allowed for a mass production of things (technical-natural hybrids) and large scale global issues that in the meanwhile threaten endangered the distinction as such. E.g. \"We Have Never Been Modern\" asks to reconnect the social and natural worlds returning to the premodern use of \"thing\" - addressing objects as hybrids made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.\n\nScience studies scholars such as Trevor Pinch and Steve Woolgar started already in the 1980s to involve \"technology\", and called their field 'science, technology and society'. This \"turn to technology\" brought science studies into communication with academics in science, technology, and society programs.\n\nMore recently, a novel approach known as mapping controversies has been gaining momentum among science studies practitioners, and was introduced as a course for students in engineering, and architecture schools. in 2002 Harry Collins and Robert Evans asked for a third wave of science studies (a pun on \"The Third Wave\"), namely studies of \"expertise\" and \"experience\" answering to recent tendencies to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public.\n\nA showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is Brian Wynne's study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the Chernobyl disaster. He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in Cumbria, who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of radioactive contamination, allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in 1986. The sheep farmers suffered economic losses and their resistance against the regulation imposed was being deemed irrational and not adequate. It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken. The example lead to various attempts to better involve local knowledge and experience of lay people and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.\n\nDonovan et al. (2012) used and described the STS respectively science studies for \"social studies of volcanology\" and the generation of knowledge and expert advice on various active volcanoes. It contains a survey of volcanologists carried out during 2008 and 2009 and interviews with scientists in the UK, Montserrat, Italy and Iceland during fieldwork seasons. Donovan et al. (2012) asked the experts about the felt purpose of volcanology and what they considered the most important eruptions in historical time. The survey tries to identify eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science and to assess the role of scientists in policymaking. \nA main focus was on the impact of the Montserrat eruption 1997. The eruption, a classical example of the black swan theory directly killed (only) 19 persons. However the outbreak had major impacts on the local society and destroyed important infractructure, as the island's airport. About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 to the United Kingdom.\nThe Montserrat case put immense pressure on volcanologists, as their expertise suddenly became the primary driver of various public policy approaches. The STS approach provided valuable insights in that situation. There were various miscommunications among scientists. Matching scientific uncertainty (typical of volcanic unrest) and the request for a single unified voice for political advice was a challenge. The Montserrat Volcanologists began to use statistical elicitation models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but allowing to synthesizing consensus and experience-based expertise step by step. It involved as well local knowledge and experience.\n\nVolcanology as a science currently faces a shift of its epistemological foundations of volcanology. The science started to involve more research into risk assessment and risk management. It requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries but combine qualitative and quantitative outcomes in a structured whole.\n\nScience has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare Risk society) to address its risks. Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations.The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow Ulrich Beck's theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars. Some argue for a more widely distributed, pluralist understanding of expertise (Sheila Jasanoff and Brian Wynne, for example), while others argue for a more nuanced understanding of the idea of expertise and its social functions (Collins and Evans, for example).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Newton is a 1970 book by political activist Bobby Seale. It was recorded in San Francisco County Jail between November 1969 and March 1970, by Arthur Goldberg, a reporter for the \"San Francisco Bay Guardian\". An advocacy book on the cause and principles of the Black Panther Party, \"Seize The Time\" is considered a staple in Black Power literature.\n\nSeize the Time is a first-person narrative written from the perspective of Bobby Seale who recounts the story of the Black Panthers through conversational style prose. The book begins with an introduction written in 1991 by Bobby Seale wherein he provides an overview of the Black Panther Party as well as calls for people to become activists in the fight for equality.\n\nThe book itself is arranged in seven chronological chapters beginning with “Growing Up: Before the Party” which includes an introduction to Bobby Seale, his initial relationship with Huey Newton, and the antecedent behind starting the Black Panther Party. The second chapter, titled “Huey: Getting the Party Going” provides the philosophical and ideological underpinnings of party including reference to Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung which is commonly referred to as The Red Book as well as Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth which Bobby Seale introduced to Huey Newton. The third chapter, titled “The Party Grows, Eldridge Joins” chronicles the expansion of the party and the positive effect of having Eldridge Cleaver who was a writer for Ramparts (magazine) join the movement. The fourth chapter titled “Picking Up the Gun” provides an account of Bobby Seale and other Panthers getting arrested while attempting to speak out at the state capitol in Sacramento on May 2,1967 against the government creating what the Black Panthers believed to be racist legislation. The fifth chapter titled “The Shit Comes Down: Free Huey,” documents the arrest of Huey Newton and subsequent conviction for second degree murder as well as events surrounding the Free Huey party (also referred to as Huey’s birthday rally) which was a barbeque picnic rally for the Huey P. Newton Defense Fund along with a campaign fundraiser for Huey (who was running on the ticket for Congress from the Seventh Congressional District) and Bobby Seale (who was running for the State Assembly for the Seventeenth District) wherein a coalition was formed between the Black Panther Party and Stokely Carmichael as well as other members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. This chapter also accounts the events that occurred subsequent to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. including the shooting of Bobby Hutton and arrest of Eldridge Cleaver. Chapter 6, which is titled “Chicago: Kidnapped, Chained, Tired, and Gagged” chronicles the events surrounding Bobby Seale being kidnapped by federal agents and transported to Chicago where he is on trial in connection with the New Haven Black Panther trials. The final chapter of the book, titled “Pigs, Problems, Politics, and Panthers,” focuses on Bobby Seale’s beliefs regarding the underlying reasons for the Black Panther Raids including Eldridge Cleaver’s negotiations with North Vietnam and the CIA-FBI Infiltration known as COINTELPRO. This chapter also outlines the rules for members of Black Panther Party including their fight to end male chauvinism, and an overview of the Black Panther Party’s revolutionary community programs such as Free Breakfast for Children, Liberation Schools, Legal Aid, Free Medical Care, and a Free Clothing Program. The book ends with a final essay regarding the importance of “seizing the time” in the fight for revolutionary change.\n\n"}
{"id": "1010183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1010183", "title": "Senegambia Confederation", "text": "Senegambia Confederation\n\nSenegambia, officially the Senegambia Confederation, was a loose confederation in the late 20th century between the West African countries of Senegal and its neighbour The Gambia, which is almost completely surrounded by Senegal. The confederation was founded on 1 February 1982 following an agreement between the two countries signed on 12 December 1981. It was intended to promote cooperation between the two countries, but was dissolved by Senegal on 30 September 1989 after The Gambia refused to move closer toward union.\n\nAs a political unit, Senegambia was created by dueling French and English colonial forces in the region. Competition between the French and the English began in the 16th century when both started to establish trading centers. Although there was some overlap in their areas of influence, French trade centered on the Senegal River and in the Cap-Vert region and English trade on the Gambia River. The region became more important for both growing empires because West Africa allowed a convenient waystation for trade between Europe and the respective American colonies; critical to that trade was its provision of slaves for the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.\n\nAs colonialism became more lucrative, especially after the development of the Thirteen Colonies, New France, and sugar plantations in the Caribbean, England and France took greater measures to define their spheres of influence in West Africa. From 1500 to 1758, the two powers used their naval power to try to remove each other from the region. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War based in Europe, the British captured major French trading bases along the Senegal River area and formed the first Senegambia as a crown colony. The unified region collapsed in 1779. With the British occupied by the American Revolutionary War in North America, the French recaptured Saint Louis and burned the major British settlement in the Gambia region. The unified region ended officially in 1783 in the aftermath of the British defeat and independence by the United States.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles (1783) (signed along with the Treaty of Paris that officially ended the American Revolution) created a balance between France and Britain: Saint Louis, l'île de Gorée, and the Senegal River region were restored to France, and the Gambia was left to the British. In the 1860s and 1870s, both nations began to consider a land-trading proposal to unify the region, with the French trading another West African holding for the Gambia, but the exchange was never completed. Although the areas were ruled by separate, competing powers, they did not determine an official border between the French and British Senegambian colonies until 1889. At the time, France agreed to accept the current border between the two countries and remove its border trading posts.\n\nThis decision resulted in the future Senegal (which gained its independence in 1960) and The Gambia (independent in 1965) sharing a large problem: how to successfully maintain two separate countries in a region with shared yet diverse cultural values, and one nation virtually surrounded by another.\n\nFor each country, the lock and key border situation has posed unique problems for international relations, especially in trade and control of regions surrounding the Senegal–Gambia border. One of the greatest problems for both countries is the ease with which violence could spread through the region. With shared ethnic communities on both sides of the border, a successful coup in one country could lead to a group of sympathizers in the other, bringing danger to the democratic regimes of both countries.\n\nThis fear was realized during the 1981 coup attempt to oust President Dawda Jawara of the Gambia. Senegal's pro-Western stance increased its security worries since its neighboring countries might use the Gambia, secessionists in the Casamance region (the region of Senegal south of the Gambian border), or other dissident groups to destabilize the Senegalese government. Specific threats came from Kwame Nkrumah's Ghana, Moussa Traoré's Mali, Ahmed Sekou Touré's Guinea, João Bernardo Vieira's Guinea-Bissau, and Muammar al-Gaddafi's Libya. While the Senegalese government speculated about some dangers, in the late 1980s it had border skirmishes with Mauritania. After the coup attempt, the government realized that its military forces were not adequate to stop, or prevent, political upheaval. Security of the region was becoming more and more difficult to maintain.\n\nSince the end of colonization, the Senegalese government had maintained trade barriers that provided preferential treatment for French goods imported into the country, while the Gambia had virtually no trade barriers. The opposing trade policies fueled a large black market around the Senegal–Gambia border, which brought cheaper manufactured goods into Senegal.\n\nThe black market also attracted an export drain into the Gambia. The Senegalese government began to institute a delayed payment system with its groundnut (peanut) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting to wait for the Senegalese marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to Banjul, where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled Senegalese crops.\n\nIn the short term, the Senegambia Confederation was a pragmatic union based on a mutual security interest. As noted, the Senegalese government feared national instability caused by uprisings in either the Gambia or the Casamance region. This fear nearly became reality on 30 July 1981 when Gambian leftists attempted a coup d'état against President Sir Dawda Jawara. At the request of President Jawara, the Senegalese army entered the Gambia and put down the insurrection. The attempted coup resulted in both countries' leaders promoting the unification ideas which had been developing in the region. Léopold Sédar Senghor, first President of Senegal, was one of \"\" (\"the three fathers\") of Negritude—a literary and ideologically socialist movement of pan-Africanism, encouraging Africans throughout the Diaspora to embrace their shared culture. Senghor's belief in Negritude informed the possibility of unification between Senegal and the Gambia, and fostered the belief that unification would happen as an organic process.\n\nIn the 1960s, Senegal and The Gambia commissioned a United Nations report to study the possible plans and benefits of unification between the two countries. The eight-year Senegambia Confederation was one of the longest-lived African unions of the period.\n\nThroughout the integration process, support came primarily from the two governments and their social elites; neither the Senegalese nor the Gambian people at large were particularly interested in integration. Once the threat of political instability began to dissipate, both sides began to move back to their traditional fears and stereotypes of the other. The Gambian government (and the Gambian people) began to fear losing their own power and identity through Senegalese engulfment. Hughes and Lewis, in their Senegambia analysis, list many problems with unions which often lead to failure, which this union shared.\n\nThe union had both pragmatic and ideological elements. Because it was created in response to security concerns, when that threat was believed finished, the confederation's momentum began to die. Senegal unilaterally pulled out its troops from the Gambia when it was threatened by Mauritania (see Borders above). Gambia felt its interests were not being protected. The main platform on which union had been built was also the element on which it foundered. The end came on 23 August 1989, when President Diouf decided it was best that the confederation be placed aside after fruitless talks about a customs union.\n\nAs the confederation had economically benefited Senegal's Casamance region, its end resulted in worsening living conditions of the local population. This helped militant separatists, most importantly the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance, to grow in strength and thus partially contributed to the outbreak of the armed Casamance conflict.\n"}
{"id": "49546832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49546832", "title": "Social multiplier effect", "text": "Social multiplier effect\n\nThe social multiplier effect is a term used in economics, economic geography, sociology, public health and other academic disciplines to describe certain social externalities. It is based on the principle that high levels of one attribute amongst one's peers can have spillover effects on an individual. \"This social multiplier can also be thought of as a ratio ∆P/∆I where ∆I is the average response of an individual action to an exogenous parameter (that affects only that person) and ∆P is the (per capita) response of the peer group to a change in the same parameter that affects the entire peer group.\" In other words, it is the ratio of an individual action to an exogenous parameter to the aggregate effect of the same parameter on the individual's peers.\n\nFor example, we know that health outcomes strongly correlate with education level. Given the social multiplier effect, we know that in the aggregate, if a poorly educated individual moves into a highly educated area they will experience some of the positive health effects associated with being more educated. It is important however to distinguish between 1) a local-average model or social norms, whereby certain attributes are adopted based on them being the socially normal behavior, and 2) a local-aggregate model or social multiplier effect whereby \"peer effects are captured by the sum of friends' efforts in some activity.\" In the former an individual pays a price for deviating from a norm. In the latter, as an individual gains more peers who have a certain attribute, they will experience greater utility for adopting this attribute as well. The following are some examples of research on the social multiplier effect.\n\nResearchers Scott E. Carrell et. al. have shown that one's friends' fitness affects one's own fitness. They find that \"each out-of-shape individual creates two additional out-of-shape individuals through their social interactions.\" Another researcher Jeffery Fletcher has found that a 10 percent increase in the number of students who smoke at a high school increases the chances another student will smoke by about 3 percent. Xiaodong Liu et. al. have found that there is a multiplier effect for juvenile delinquency in schools. Additionally, in another article Carell et. al. find that peer cheating increases the likelihood that an individual will cheat.\n\nThe social multiplier effect is of particular concern to researchers in economic geography. It is well documented that factors like income and education have strong positive correlations with many aspects of health. This is important because the geographic distribution of income and education is becoming increasingly stratified. For example, since 1980, on average, cities that had high levels of college educated workers are becoming increasingly college educated whereas those who had low levels are becoming increasingly less educated. The same trend applies to income. Consequently, as the distribution of income and education level becomes more disparate, many low income regions lose out on the social multiplier benefits they once enjoyed.\n\n\n"}

It was created by trauma therapist Peter A. Levine.\n\nSessions are normally done in person, and involve a client tracking his or her own experience. Practitioners are often mental health practitioners such as social workers, psychologists, marriage and family therapists (MFTs) or psychotherapists, but may also be nurses, physicians, bodyworkers, physical therapists, chaplains, clergy, or members of other professions. Certified practitioners complete a three-year training course (216 hours of instruction) and must complete 18 hours of case consultations and 12 hours of personal sessions. Somatic Experiencing is used for shock trauma in the short term and for developmental trauma as an adjunct to psychotherapy that may span years.\n\nSomatic Experiencing attempts to promote awareness and release physical tension that remains in the aftermath of trauma.\n\nAnother element of Somatic Experiencing therapy is \"pendulation\", the movement between regulation and dysregulation. The client is helped to move to a state where he or she is dysregulated (i.e. is aroused or frozen, demonstrated by physical symptoms such as pain or numbness) and then iteratively helped to return to a state of regulation. The goal is to allow the client to resolve the physical and mental difficulties caused by the trauma, and thereby to be able to respond appropriately to everyday situations.\n\n\"Resources\" are defined as anything that helps the client's autonomic nervous system return to a regulated state. This might be the memory of someone close to them, a physical item that might ground them in the present moment, or other supportive elements that minimize distress. In the face of arousal, \"discharge\" is facilitated to allow the client's body to return to a regulated state. Discharge may be in the form of tears, a warm sensation, unconscious movement, the ability to breathe easily again, or other responses which demonstrate the autonomic nervous system returning to its baseline. The intention of this process is to reinforce the client's inherent capacity to self-regulate.\nSomatic experiencing is used for both shock trauma and developmental trauma. Shock trauma is loosely defined as a single-episode traumatic event such as a car accident, natural disaster such as an earthquake, battlefield incident, physical attack, etc. Developmental trauma refers to various kinds of psychological damage that occur during child development when a child has insufficient or detrimental attention from the primary caregivers.\n\n"}

His great-grandfather was Rev. Jonathan Judd (1719-1803), clergyman of Southampton, while his grandfather ran the family store. His father, after working in the store in his boyhood, went to Boston for several years, where, according to Judd's sister's biography, he became a voracious reader, returning to the family business, but then becoming editor of \"The Hampshire Gazette\". Sylvester Judd III studied at Hopkins Academy in Hadley, Massachusetts, where he was president of the Literary Society and delivered the valedictorian address. He graduated from Yale College in 1836, and from Harvard Divinity School in 1840. His dissertation was entitled \"The Uses of Intellectual Philosophy to the Preacher\". While a student, on April 4, 1838, Judd traveled to Concord, Massachusetts to meet Ralph Waldo Emerson after reading his essay \"Epic Poetry\". Emerson was pleased by Judd's interest in seeking a mystical identification with Christ. Judd may have been in the audience on August 31, 1837, and heard Emerson's commencement speech to the Phi Beta Kappa Society known as \"The American Scholar.\"\n\nJudd was ordained a Unitarian minister on October 1, 1840, becoming pastor of a church in Augusta, Maine. He was a member of the Maine Peace Society which was anti-war and sought justice through a World Court. Early in 1841, Judd met Jane Elizabeth Williams, the daughter of United States Senator Reuel Williams. The couple married on August 31, 1841; they had three daughters: Jane Elizabeth (September 26, 1844), Frances Hall (June 28, 1847), and Apphia Williams (March 16, 1853). Judd's third daughter was born two months after his death. His second daughter, Frances, married the Unitarian minister Seth Curtis Beach on November 17, 1869. Their son, Reuel W. Beach (Harvard graduate, married Ruth Walcott Stetson in 1909), and grandson, Curtis Beach, were both Unitarian ministers. Frances and Seth Beach's second son, Dr. Sylvester Judd Beach, lived from 1879-1953, residing in Portland, ME. Dr. Beach served as President of the Wayflete School in Portland, bringing progressive education to the school. Sylvester Judd's sister, Apphia Putnam Judd (born Oct 27, 1820 in Westhampton; died 1901 in Augusta), married his wife's brother, Joseph Hartwell Williams (1814-1896), who was the 27th governor of Maine (1857-1858).\n\nAccording to Philip Brockway, Judd's early influences were Calvinist puritanism. After a spiritual conversion to Unitarianism as a young man, his readings took on wide spheres, particularly while at Yale College and then Harvard Divinity School. His readings included the poetry of Jones Very, the writings of Thomas Carlyle, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Robert Owen, Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, \"Goethe's Conversations with a Child\" by Bettina von Arnim, and the writings of William Ellery Channing, the Unitarian theologian, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nBrockway cites Emerson's journal entry from 1852, the year before Judd's death at 40: \"I saw Judd in Augusta [Maine], in February, and asked him who his companions were. He said, 'Sunsets.' I told him I thought they needed men. He said, 'I'm a priest and converse with the sick and dying.'\"\n\nAmerican critic and poet James Russell Lowell called Judd's novel \"Margaret\" \"the most emphatically American book ever written\". He mentioned the novel in his long satire \"A Fable for Critics\" (1848) as \"the first Yankee book / With the \"soul\" of Down East in 't, and things farther East\". In a 39-page review, however, critic William Bourne Oliver Peabody called the work unfinished and its characters and style inconsistent. After publishing his novel \"Philo\", Judd sent a copy to Edward Everett Hale, who responded, \"I think \"Philo\" glorious.\"\n\nThe critic and poet Richard J. Powers finds the child characterization of Margaret in the novel the prototype for Nathaniel Hawthorne's character of Pearl, Hester Prynne's daughter, in the 1850 novel \"The Scarlet Letter\".\n\nHe also wrote a large number of sermons and religious addresses. Judd's papers are at the Harvard University Library, Yale University Library and Lithgow Library in Augusta. His father's papers are in the Forbes Library, Northampton, MA.\n\n"}
{"id": "246725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246725", "title": "Symposium (Plato)", "text": "Symposium (Plato)\n\nThe Symposium (, \"Sympósion\" ) is a philosophical text by Plato dated c. 385–370 BC. It depicts a friendly contest of extemporaneous speeches given by a group of notable men attending a banquet. The men include the philosopher Socrates, the general and political figure Alcibiades, and the comic playwright Aristophanes. The speeches are to be given in praise of Eros, who is the god of love and desire, and the son of Aphrodite. In the \"Symposium\", Eros is recognized both as erotic love, and as a phenomenon that is capable of inspiring courage, valor, great deeds and works, and vanquishing man’s natural fear of death. It is seen as transcending its earthly origins, and attaining spiritual heights. This extraordinary elevation of the concept of love raises a question of whether some of the most extreme extents of meaning might be intended as humor or farce. \"Eros\" is almost always translated as “love”, and the English word has its own varieties and ambiguities that provide additional challenges to the effort to understand the \"Eros\" of ancient Athens.\n\nThe event depicted in the \"Symposium\" is a banquet attended by a group of men, who have come to the symposium, which was, in ancient Greece, a traditional part of the same banquet that took place after the meal, when drinking for pleasure was accompanied by music, dancing, recitals, or conversation. The setting means that the participants will be drinking wine; this suggests that the men might be induced to say things they wouldn’t say elsewhere or when sober. They might speak frankly, or take risks, or be prone to hubris — they might even be inspired to make speeches that are particularly heartfelt and noble.\n\nThe host has challenged the men to deliver, each in turn, an encomiuma speech in praise of Love (Eros). The party takes place at the house of the tragedian Agathon in Athens. This dialogue is one of Plato's major works; it is appreciated for its philosophical content and literary quality.\n\nThe \"Symposium\" is considered a dialogue – a form used by Plato in more than thirty works – but in fact it is predominantly a series of essay-like speeches from differing points of view. So dialogue plays a smaller role in the \"Symposium\" than it does in Plato’s other dialogues. With dialogue, Socrates is renowned for his dialectic, which is his ability to ask questions that encourage others to think deeply about what they care about, and articulate their ideas. In the \"Symposium\" the dialectic exists among the speeches: in seeing how the ideas conflict from speech-to-speech, and in the effort to resolve the contradictions and see the philosophy that underlies them all.\n\nIt is important to understand that the \"Symposium\" is, like all of Plato’s dialogues, fiction. The characters and the settings are to some degree based on history, but they are not reports of events that actually occurred or words that were actually spoken. There is no reason to think they were not composed entirely by Plato. The reader, understanding that Plato was not governed by the historical record, can read the \"Symposium\", and ask why the author, Plato, arranged the story the way he did, and what he meant by including the various aspects of setting, composition, characters, and theme, etc.\n\nFor a very long time it was widely believed that Socrates was presented in the dialogues by his admiring disciple, Plato, as an ideal philosopher and ideal human being. It was thought that what Socrates said was what Plato agreed with or approved of. Then in the late 20th Century another interpretation began to challenge that idea. This new idea considers that the \"Symposium\" is intended to criticize Socrates, and his philosophy, and to reject certain aspects of his behavior. It also considers that Socratic philosophy may have lost touch with the actual individual as it devoted itself to abstract principles.\n\nThe above view, attributed to Martha Nussbaum, can however be challenged in favor of the traditional one. The portrayal of Socrates in the \"Symposium\" (for instance his refusal to give in to Alcibiades’ sexual advances) is consistent with the account of Socrates put forward by Xenophon and the theories that Socrates defends throughout the platonic corpus. Plato shows off his master as a man of high moral standards, unwavered by baser urges and fully committed to the study and practice of proper self-government in both individuals and communities (the so-called \"royal science\"). The dialogue’s ending constrasts Socrates’ intellectual and emotional self-mastery with Alcibiades’ debauchery and lack of moderation to explain the latter’s reckless political career, disastrous military campaigns and eventual demise. Alcibiades is corrupted by his physical beauty and the advantages thereof ; he ultimately fails to ascend to the Form of Beauty through philosophy.\n\nOne critic, James Arieti, considers that the \"Symposium\" resembles a drama, with emotional and dramatic events occurring especially when Alcibiades crashes the banquet. Arieti suggests that it should be studied more as a drama, with a focus on character and actions, and less as an exploration of philosophical ideas. This suggests that the characters speak, as in a play, not as the author, but as themselves. This theory, Arieti has found, reveals how much each of the speakers of the \"Symposium\" resembles the god, Eros, that they each are describing. It may be Plato’s point to suggest that when humankind talks about god, they are drawn towards creating that god in their own image.\n\nAndrew Dalby considers the opening pages of the \"Symposium\" the best depiction in any ancient Greek source of the way texts are transmitted by oral tradition without writing. It shows how an oral text may have no simple origin, and how it can be passed along by repeated tellings, and by different narrators, and how it can be sometimes verified, and sometimes corrupted. The story of the symposium is being told by Apollodorus to his friend. Apollodorus was not himself at the banquet, but he heard the story from Aristodemus, a man who was there. Also, Apollodorus was able to confirm parts of the story with Socrates himself, who was one of the speakers at the banquet. A story that Socrates narrates, when it is his turn to speak, was told to Socrates by a woman named Diotima, a philosopher and a priestess.\n\nIn \"The Frogs\", Aristophanes attacks the new tragedy of Agathon and Euripides, opposing it to the old tragedy of Aeschylus. In Aristophanes’ comedy, Dionysus, the god of theatre and wine, descends into Hades and observes a heated dispute between Aeschylus and Euripides over who is the best in tragedy. Dionysus is engaged to be the judge, and decides the outcome, not based on the merits of the two tragedians, but based on their political stance regarding the political figure, Alcibiades. Since Aeschylus prefers Alcibiades, Dionysus declares Aeschylus the winner. That contest provides the basic structure on which the \"Symposium\" is modeled as a kind of sequel: In the \"Symposium\" Agathon has just celebrated a victory the day before, and is now hosting another kind of debate, this time it is between a tragedian, a comic poet, and Socrates. At the beginning of the \"Symposium\" Agathon asserts that “Dionysus will be the judge”, and Dionysus is, though Alcibiades performs as surrogate for the god. So the character, Alcibiades, who was the deciding factor in the debate in \"The Frogs\", becomes the judge in the \"Symposium\", and he now rules in favor of Socrates, who had been attacked by Aristophanes in \"The Clouds\". The Symposium is a response to \"The Frogs\", and shows Socrates winning not only over Aristophanes, who was the author of both \"The Frogs\", and \"The Clouds,\" but also over the tragic poet who was portrayed in that comedy as the victor.\n\nIt is considered that the work was written no earlier than 385 BCE, and the party to which it makes reference has been fixed in 416 BCE, the year in which the host Agathon had the dramatic triumph mentioned in the text. The disastrous expedition to Syracuse, of which Alcibiades was a commander, took place the following year, after which Alcibiades deserted to Sparta, Athens' archenemy.\n\nHamilton remarks that Plato takes care to portray Alcibiades and Socrates and their relationship in a way that makes it clear that Socrates had not been a bad influence on Alcibiades. Plato does this to free his teacher from the guilt of corrupting the minds of prominent youths, which had in fact earned Socrates the death sentence in 399 BC.\n\nThe story of the banquet is narrated by Apollodorus, but before the narration proper begins, it is shown that Apollodorus is telling the story to a friend of his that isn’t named, and also that the story of this banquet has been told before by others, as well as previously by Apollodorus himself. This section previews the story of the banquet, letting the reader know what to expect, and it provides information regarding the context and the date. The banquet was hosted by the poet Agathon to celebrate his first victory in a dramatic competition: the Dionysia of 416 BCE. Apollodorus was not present at the event, which occurred when he was a boy, but he heard the story from Aristodemus, who was present. Apollodorus later checked parts of the story with Socrates, who was also there. In this brief introductory passage it is shown that the narrator, Apollodorus, has a reputation for being somewhat mad, that he is a passionate follower of Socrates, and that he spends his days either listening to Socrates or else telling others of what he has learned from Socrates. The story, as told by Apollodorus, then moves to the banquet at Agathon’s home, where Agathon challenges each of the men to speak in praise of the Greek god, Eros.\n\nApollodorus tells to his friend a story of a symposium, or banquet, that was hosted by the playwright Agathon to celebrate his victory in a dramatic festival the night before. Socrates is late to arrive, after he became lost in thought on the porch of a nearby neighbor. When they are done eating, Eryximachus takes the suggestion made by Phaedrus, that they should all make a speech in praise of Eros, the god of love and desire. It will be a competition of speeches to be judged by Dionysus. It is anticipated that the speeches will ultimately be bested by Socrates, who speaks last.\n\nPhaedrus starts by pointing out that Eros is the oldest of the gods, and that Eros promotes virtue in people. Pausanias is next, and he contrasts common desire with a “heavenly” love in the form of pederasty, which occurs between a man and a young boy; and in which the boy gives sexual pleasure, and in return gains knowledge and virtue. Next Eryximachus speaks, and suggests that Eros encourages “sophrosyne”, or soundness of mind and character, and is not only about human behavior, but also occurs in music, medicine, and many other areas of life.\n\nNext is Aristophanes, the comic playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological story about how humans were at one time twice the people that they are now, but this was seen as threatening to the gods, so Zeus cut everyone in half. And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, in order to become whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source of all human virtues.\n\nSocrates asks questions of Agathon: has he referred to the object of love, or love itself? Socrates then relates a story he was told by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god, but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful, but is the desire for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the “form of beauty”, which humans must try to achieve.\n\nWhen Socrates is nearly done, Dionysus, who is to judge the speeches, arrives, in the person of Alcibiades. Alcibiades crashes in, terribly drunk, and delivers a encomium to Socrates himself. No matter how hard he has tried, he says, he has never been able to seduce Socrates, because Socrates has no interest in physical pleasure.\n\nUnder the influence of Dionysus, who is now in attendance, the party becomes wild and drunken. Aristodemus goes to sleep. When he wakes up the next morning Socrates is still talking and debating. Soon everyone at last falls asleep, as Socrates rises up and goes off to tend to his daily business as usual.\n\nIn order to understand Plato more clearly, it is useful to bear in mind his theory of Forms, according to which all the phenomena perceived by the senses are imitations of eternal and perfect Forms that alone have reality. Beauty belongs to this category of Forms.\n\nThe dialogue's seven major speeches are delivered by:\n\nPhaedrus opens by citing Hesiod, Acusilaus and Parmenides for the claim that Eros is the oldest of the gods. He confers great benefits, inspiring a lover to earn the admiration of his beloved, for example by showing bravery on the battlefield, since nothing shames a man more than to be seen by his beloved committing an inglorious act (178d-179b). \"A handful of such men, fighting side by side, would defeat practically the whole world.\" Lovers sometimes sacrifice their lives for their beloved. As evidence for this he mentions some mythological heroes and lovers. Even Achilles, who was the beloved of Patroclus, sacrificed himself to avenge his lover, and Alcestis was willing to die for her husband Admetus.\n\nPhaedrus concludes his short speech in proper rhetorical fashion, reiterating his statements that love is one of the most ancient gods, the most honoured, the most powerful in helping men gain honor and blessedness – and sacrificing one's self for love will result in rewards from the gods.\n\nPausanias, the legal expert of the group, introduces a distinction between a nobler and a baser kind of love, which anticipates Socrates' discourse. The base lover is in search of sexual gratification, and his objects are women and boys. He is inspired by \"Aphrodite Pandemos\" (Aphrodite common to the whole city). The noble lover directs his affection towards young men, establishing lifelong relationships, productive of the benefits described by Phaedrus. This love is related to \"Aphrodite Urania\" (Heavenly Aphrodite), and is based on honoring one's partner’s intelligence and wisdom.\n\nHe then analyses the attitudes of different citystates relative to homosexuality. The first distinction he makes is between the cities that clearly establish what is and what is not admitted, and those that are not so explicitly clear, like Athens. In the first group there are cities favorable to homosexuality, like Elis, Boeotia and Sparta, or unfavorable to it like Ionia and Persia. The case of Athens is analyzed with many examples of what would be acceptable and what would not, and at the end he makes the assertion that Athens' code of behaviour favors the nobler type of love and discourages the baser.\n\nEryximachus speaks next, though it is Aristophanes' turn, as the latter has not recovered from his hiccups enough to take his place in the sequence. First Eryximachus starts out by claiming that love affects everything in the universe, including plants and animals, believing that once love is attained it should be protected. The god of Love not only directs everything on the human plane, but also on the divine (186b). Two forms of love occur in the human body – one is healthy, the other unhealthy (186bc). Love might be capable of curing the diseased. Love governs medicine, music and astronomy (187a), and regulates hot and cold and wet and dry, which when in balance result in health (188a). Eryximachus here evokes the theory of the humors. He concludes: \"Love as a whole has ... total ... power ... and is the source of all happiness. It enables us to associate, and be friends, with each other and with the gods\" (188d Transl. Gill). He comes across as someone who cannot resist the temptation to praise his own profession: “a good practitioner knows how to treat the body and how to transform its desires\" (186d).\n\nW. Hamilton considers that Aristophanes' speech, which comes next, is one of Plato's most brilliant literary achievements. The speech has become a focus of subsequent scholarly debate, as it has been seen as mere comic relief, and sometimes as satire: the creation myth Aristophanes puts forward to account for sexuality may be read as poking fun at the myths concerning the origins of humanity, numerous in classical Greek mythology.\n\nBefore starting his speech, Aristophanes warns the group that his eulogy to love may be more absurd than funny. His speech is an explanation of why people in love say they feel \"whole\" when they have found their love partner. He begins by explaining that people must understand human nature before they can interpret the origins of love and how it affects their own times. This is, he says, because in primal times people had double bodies, with faces and limbs turned away from one another. As spherical creatures who wheeled around like clowns doing cartwheels (190a), these original people were very powerful. There were three sexes: the all male, the all female, and the \"androgynous,\" who was half male, half female. The males were said to have descended from the sun, the females from the earth and the androgynous couples from the moon. These creatures tried to scale the heights of Olympus and planned to set upon the gods (190b-c). Zeus thought about blasting them with thunderbolts, but did not want to deprive himself of their devotions and offerings, so he decided to cripple them by chopping them in half, in effect separating the two bodies.\n\nEver since that time, people run around saying they are looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were separated from women run after their own kind, thus creating lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men (191e). Those that come from original androgynous beings are the men and women that engage in heterosexual love. He says some people think homosexuals are shameless, but he thinks they are the bravest, most manly of all, as evidenced by the fact that only they grow up to be politicians (192a), and that many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful (191e). Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated (192c). This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained. Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the axe again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart again(193a). If man works with the god of Love, they will escape this fate and instead find wholeness.\n\nHis speech may be regarded as self-consciously poetic and rhetorical, composed in the way of the sophists, gently mocked by Socrates.\nAgathon complains that the previous speakers have made the mistake of congratulating mankind on the blessings of love, failing to give due praise to the god himself (194e). He says that love is the youngest of gods and is an enemy of old age (195b). He says that the god of love shuns the very sight of senility and clings to youth. Agathon says love is dainty, and likes to tiptoe through the flowers and never settles where there is no \"bud to bloom\" (196b). It would seem that none of the characters at the party, with the possible exception of Agathon himself, would be candidates for love's companionship. Socrates, probably the oldest member of the party, seems certain to be ruled out. He also implies that love creates justice, moderation, courage, and wisdom. These are the cardinal virtues in ancient Greece. Although devoid of philosophical content, the speech Plato puts in the mouth of Agathon is a beautifully formal one, and Agathon contributes to the Platonic love theory with the idea that the object of love is beauty.\n\nSocrates turns politely to Agathon and with Agathon's cooperation examines his speech. This is done using a series of questions and answers typical of Plato's Socratic dialogues. Agathon answers affirmatively to Socrates' line of questioning, thus refuting many of the statements in his previous speech (199d). After this dialogue with Agathon that establishes the foundation for Plato's theory of love, Socrates repeats a new dialogue in which a woman of Mantinea, called Diotima, plays the same inquiring/instructing role Socrates has played with Agathon.\n\nDiotima first explains that Love is a spirit halfway between gods and men and traces his mythological descent as son of \"Contrivance\" (father) and \"Poverty\" (mother). Love has attributes from both parents, he is beggarly, harsh and a master of artifice and deception (203d) and is delicately balanced and resourceful (204c). Having been born at Aphrodite’s birthday party he became her follower and servant, and consequently is a lover of beauty, but since wisdom is one of the most beautiful things, he is a lover of wisdom too.\n\nThen Diotima moves to the definition of the aim of love as “the perpetual possession of what is good”. Lovers are pregnant with what is good and attain immortality through procreation, either intellectual or physical.\n\nIn the conclusion of her exposition Diotima explains that men should make an ascent to arrive at the discovery of the Ideal Form of Beauty. Men should start with the love of a particular beautiful person. The next step is to pass from this particular instance to beauty in general, and from physical to moral beauty. The fourth step is to attain the love of wisdom, and then from this to the appreciation of the absolute and divine beauty (the Form of Beauty).\n\nThis speech, in the interpretation of Marsilio Ficino in \"De amore\" (1484), is the origin of the concept of Platonic love.\n\nEntering upon the scene late and inebriated, he pays tribute to Socrates. Like Agathon and Aristophanes, Alcibiades is a historical person from ancient Athens. A year after the events of the \"Symposium\", his political enemies would drive him to flee Athens under fear of being sentenced to death for sacrilege and turn traitor to the Spartans. By his own admission, he is very handsome.\n\nFinding himself seated on a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed to sit next to the handsomest man in the room, Agathon, and that he is always doing such things (213c). Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Alcibiades says he will never do such a thing (213e). Wondering why everyone seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night's agreement (213e, c); after saying his drunken ramblings should not be placed next to the sober orations of the rest, and that he hopes no one believed a word Socrates said, Alcibiades proposes to offer an encomium to Socrates (214c-e).\n\nAlcibiades begins by comparing Socrates to a statue of Silenus; the statue is ugly and hollow, and inside it is full of tiny golden statues of the gods (215a-b). He then compares Socrates to a satyr Marsyas; Socrates, however, needs no flute to \"cast his spell\" on people as Marsyas did — he needs only his words (215b-d).\n\nAlcibiades states that when he hears Socrates speak, he feels overwhelmed. The words of Socrates are the only ones to have ever upset him so deeply that his soul started to realize that his aristocratic life was no better than a slave's (215e). Socrates is the only man who has ever made Alcibiades feel shame (216b). Yet all this is the least of it (216c)- Socrates is mad about beautiful boys, following them around in a daze (216d). Most people, he continues, don't know what Socrates is like on the inside:\n\nAlcibiades thought at the time that Socrates really only wanted him sexually, and by letting Socrates have his way with him he would entice Socrates to teach him everything he knew (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates \"as if I were the lover and he my young prey!\" (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to view Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c-d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades might be wrong and Socrates may be of no use to him (218e-219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, to the deep humiliation of Alcibiades, Socrates made no sexual attempt (219b-d).\n\nIn his speech, Alcibiades goes on to describe Socrates' virtues, his incomparable valor in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c). But be warned: Socrates may present himself as your lover, but before you know it you will have fallen in love with him.\n\nDespite this speech, Agathon then lies down next to Socrates, much to the chagrin of Alcibiades. The symposium comes to an end when a large drunken group shows up. Many of the main characters take the opportunity to depart and return home; Socrates, however, stays awake until dawn. As Aristodemus wakes up and leaves the house, Socrates is proclaiming to Agathon and Aristophanes that a skilful playwright should be able to write comedy as well as tragedy (223d). When Agathon and Aristophanes at last fall asleep, Socrates leaves, walks to the Lyceum to wash, and spends the rest of the day as he usually did, not going home to sleep until that evening (223d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word is rarely used of oneself, but rather is applied descriptively to the behavior of other people. The person who is carrying out \"amae\" may beg or plead, or alternatively act selfishly while secure in the knowledge that the caregiver will indulge them. The behavior of children towards their parents is perhaps the most common example of \"amae\", but Doi argued that child-rearing practices in the Western world seek to stop this kind of dependence, whereas in Japan it persists into adulthood in all kinds of social relationships.\n\nDoi developed this idea to explain and describe many kinds of Japanese behavior. However, Doi states that while \"amae\" is not just a Japanese phenomenon, the Japanese are the only people known to have an extensive vocabulary for describing it. The reason for this is that \"amae\" is a major factor in Japanese interaction and customs. Doi argues that nonverbal empathic guesswork (\"sasshi\" ), a fondness for unanimous agreement in decision-making, the ambiguity and hesitation of self-expression (\"enryo\" ), and the \"tatemae–honne\" dynamics are communicative manifestations of the \"amae\" psychology of Japanese people.\nDoi translates \"amaeru\" as \"to depend and presume upon another's benevolence\". It indicates, for Doi, \"helplessness and the desire to be loved\". \"Amaeru\" can also be defined as \"to wish to be loved\", and denotes dependency needs. \"Amae\" is, in essence, a request for indulgence of one's perceived needs.\n\nDoi says,\nAccording to Doi and others, in Japan the kind of relationship based on this prototype provides a model of human relationships in general, especially (though not exclusively) when one person is senior to another. As another writer puts it:\n\"Amae\" may also be used to describe the behavior of a husband who comes home drunk and depends on his wife to get him ready for bed. In Japan, \"amae\" does have a connotation of immaturity, but it is also recognized as a key ingredient in loving relationships, perhaps more so than the notions of romance so common in the West.\n\nDoi's work has been heavily criticized by academics specializing in nihonjinron studies as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies. (See Dale, P. 1986 The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Mouer and Sugimoto 1986, 1982, Kubota 1999)\n\nDoi's work has been hailed as a distinctive contribution to psychoanalysis by the American psychiatrist Frank Johnson, who has devoted a full book-length study to Doi and to his critics.\n\nIt was originally published in Japanese in 1971, and an English translation by John Bester was later published in 1973.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25513705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25513705", "title": "The Master and His Emissary", "text": "The Master and His Emissary\n\nThe Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World is a 2009 book written by Iain McGilchrist that deals with the specialist hemispheric functioning of the brain. The differing world views of the right and left brain (the \"Master\" and \"Emissary\" in the title, respectively) have, according to the author, shaped Western culture since the time of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, and the growing conflict between these views has implications for the way the modern world is changing. In part, McGilchrist's book, which is the product of twenty years of research, reviews the evidence of previous related research and theories, and based on this and cultural evidence, the author arrives at his own conclusions.\n\n\"The Master and His Emissary\" received mostly favourable reviews upon its publication. Critics praised the book as being a landmark publication that could alter readers' perspective of how they viewed the world; A. C. Grayling, however, commented about the book that \"the findings of brain science are nowhere near fine-grained enough yet to support the large psychological and cultural conclusions Iain McGilchrist draws\".\n\n\"The Master and His Emissary\" was shortlisted for the 2010 Bristol Festival of Ideas Book Prize, and was longlisted for the Royal Society 2010 Prize for Science Books.\n\nIn an interview with \"Frontier Psychiatrist\", McGilchrist cites two main influences on his work: the psychiatrist John Cutting, and the Chicago psychologist David McNeill. McGilchrist states: \"What I began to see – and it was John Cutting's work on the right hemisphere that set me thinking – was that the difference lay not in what they [the two hemispheres] do, but how they do it.\" In the same interview, the author explains: \"Some very subtle research by David McNeill, amongst others, confirms that thought originates in the right hemisphere, is processed for expression in speech by the left hemisphere, and the meaning integrated again by the right (which alone understands the overall meaning of a complex utterance, taking everything into account).\"\n\nThe 608-page book is divided into an introduction, two parts and a conclusion. In the introduction, McGilchrist states that \"there is, literally, a world of difference between the [brain] hemispheres. Understanding quite what that is has involved a journey through many apparently unrelated areas: not just neurology and psychology, but philosophy, literature and the arts, and even, to some extent, archaeology and anthropology.\"\n\nIn \"The Divided Brain\", McGilchrist digests study after study, replacing the popular and superficial notion of the hemispheres as respectively logical and creative in nature with the idea that they pay attention in fundamentally different ways, the left being detail-oriented, the right being whole-oriented. These two modes of perception cascade into wildly different hemispheric personalities, and in fact reflect yet a further asymmetry in their status, that of the right's more immediate relationship with physical bodies (our own as well as others) and external reality as represented by the senses, a relationship that makes it the mediator, the first and last stop, of all experience.\n\nIn the second part, \"How the Brain Has Shaped Our World\", the author describes the evolution of Western culture, as influenced by hemispheric brain functioning, from the ancient world, through the Renaissance and Reformation; the Enlightenment; Romanticism and Industrial Revolution; to the modern and postmodern worlds which, to our detriment, are becoming increasingly dominated by the left brain.\n\nThe book received mixed reviews in various newspapers and journals. \nReviewing \"The Master and His Emissary\" in the \"American Journal of Psychiatry\", Jacob Freedman wrote the book “valiantly addresses the effect hemispheric asymmetry has had on Western civilization\" and that it chronicled \"how the left brain's determined reductionism and the right brain's insightful and holistic approach have shaped music, language, politics, and art.\" A review by Bryan Appleyard in \"Times Online\" described the book as suggesting \"we are thinking more and more like machines, and risk losing what makes us human\", while David Cox in the \"Evening Standard\" wrote that the author \"shows convincingly that the degeneracy of the West springs from our failure to manage the binary division of our brains.\"\n\nIn a positive review in \"The Guardian\", philosopher Mary Midgley wrote that the book \"points out the complexity, the divided nature of thought itself and asks about its connection with the structure of the brain\", and that \"though neurologists may well not welcome it because it asks them new questions, the rest of us will surely find it splendidly thought-provoking\". In another positive review in \"Standpoint\" magazine, Professor Adam Zeman wrote that McGilcrist \"extends [the] received wisdom with a hugely ambitious, absorbing and questionable thesis: the two hemispheres have radically contrasting personalities; that they live in a state of creative tension, sometimes declining into open war; and that their struggle for supremacy provides the key to understanding the major cultural movements of human history. In \"The Times Literary Supplement\", W. F. Bynum wrote: \"McGilchrist's careful analysis of how brains work is a veritable tour de force, gradually and skilfully revealed. I know of no better exposition of the current state of functional brain neuroscience.\"\n\nIn a mixed review in \"Literary Review\", A. C. Grayling wrote that the book was \"beautifully written, erudite, fascinating and adventurous\", but added that \"the findings of brain science are nowhere near fine-grained enough yet to support the large psychological and cultural conclusions Iain McGilchrist draws\". A negative review in \"The Economist\" stated that the book resorted to \"generalisations of breathtaking sweep\" and that the second part of the book \"has plainly become untethered from its moorings in brain science\". Likewise, Michael Corbalis said of the work, that \"Although widely acclaimed, this book goes far beyond the neurological facts.\" \n\nOwen Flanagan alleged many shortcomings of the book and delivered a dismissive statement: \"The fact is, hemispheric differences are not well understood. Neither are patterns over 2,500 years of western history. Trying to explain the ill-understood latter with a caricature of the former does little to illuminate either\". McGilchrist wrote scathingly of this review, saying: \"But anyone who has read my book and reads that review will realise what a shameful piece of writing it is\", picking on what he alleges to be evidence of superficiality and misrepresentation.\n\n\n\n\nParts of this lecture were republished by the RSA in October 2011 as one of a series of \"RSA Animates\" with cartoonist Andrew Park's illustrations. The twelve-minute animation accompanying McGilchrist's talk took Park two months to complete. \n\n"}

In 1763, he entered a competition that was sponsored by the Berlin Academy for an essay on the application of mathematical proofs to metaphysics. Among the competitors were Moses Mendelssohn, who won, and Immanuel Kant. While in Rinteln, Abbt wrote his other famous work, \"Vom Verdienste\" (1765).\n\nHe travelled for nine months to France, where he was able to speak with Voltaire in Ferney. He also climbed in the Alps of Savoy. This travel and the disapproval of the life at the university raised his urge to \"trade the Theory for the Life\".\n\nWhile dealing with the idea to become a historian, he was offered in 1765 at the same time a professorship at the University of Marburg and a post as Councillor of the Court at the court of Count Wilhelm von Schaumburg-Lippe. He decided for the latter. The count was highly interested in the plans of Thomas Abbt, which included a history of Maximilian and a translation of Sallust among others.\n\nHowever in 1766, the twenty-seven-year-old Abbt suddenly died of an intestinal illness in Bückeburg. Of him Herder wrote that he \"died for Germany and for his language too early!\"\n\n\n\n"}

For example, \"It is snowing in Nebraska\" is true precisely when it is snowing in Nebraska. Truth conditions of a sentence don't necessarily reflect current reality. They are merely the conditions under which the statement would be true.\n\nMore formally, a truth condition makes for the truth of a sentence in an inductive definition of truth (for details, see the semantic theory of truth). Understood this way, truth conditions are theoretical entities. To illustrate with an example: suppose that, in a particular truth theory which is a theory of truth where truth is somehow made acceptable despite semantic terms as close as possible, the word \"Nixon\" refers to Richard M. Nixon, and \"is alive\" is associated with the set of currently living things. Then one way of representing the truth condition of \"Nixon is alive\" is as the ordered pair <Nixon, {x: x is alive}>. And we say that \"Nixon is alive\" is true if and only if the referent (or referent of) \"Nixon\" belongs to the set associated with \"is alive\", that is, if and only if Nixon is alive.\n\nIn semantics, the truth condition of a sentence is almost universally considered distinct from its meaning. The meaning of a sentence is conveyed if the truth conditions for the sentence are understood. Additionally, there are many sentences that are understood although their truth condition is uncertain. One popular argument for this view is that some sentences are necessarily true — that is, they are true whatever happens to obtain. All such sentences have the same truth conditions, but arguably do not thereby have the same meaning. Likewise, the sets {x: x is alive} and {x: x is alive and x is not a rock} are identical — they have precisely the same members — but presumably the sentences \"Nixon is alive\" and \"Nixon is alive and is not a rock\" have different meanings.\n\n\n"}

These twelve contemplations are also known as \"Barah anuprekśa\" or \"Barah bhāvana\". According to Jain Philosophy, these twelve contemplations pertain to eternal truths like nature of universe, human existence, and karma on which one must meditate. Twelve contemplations is an important topic that has been developed at all epochs of Jain literature. They are regarded as summarising fundamental teachings of the doctrine. Stoppage of new Karma is called \"Samvara\". Constant engagement on these twelve contemplations help the soul in \"samvara\" or stoppage of karmas.\n\nFollowing are twelve Anupreksas or bhavanas that one must constantly reflect or contemplate upon:\nTwelve Contemplations or \"anupreksa\" is an important tool for meditation. In Yogasastra, Hemcandra gives great importance to the twelve contemplations since constant reflections on these \"bhavanas\" results in detachment in worldly matters which in turn results in equanimity. With equanimity, passions (kasaya) are eliminated resulting in mental purity. This finally culminates into knowledge of self. Furthermore, these twelve contemplations are also one of the reasons for stoppage of influx of karmas as they regulate our thoughts and physical actions.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded by Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho in Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay in 1958, the World Friendship Crusade celebrates Friendship Day every July 30.\n\nOn July 20, 1958, while out to dinner with friends in the town of Puerto Pinasco, Paraguay, Dr. Ramón Artemio Bracho proposed the idea of a World Friendship Day to his colleagues. On that night, the World Crusade of Friendship was founded, as an activist organization that would promote the idea of celebrating worldwide friendship on July 30. The organization lobbied the United Nations for many years, until finally, on July 27, 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations assigned this date to celebrate the International Friendship Day.\n\n\"Día de la Amistad\" is celebrated every July 30 in Paraguay, where it is a popular festivity in which it is custom among Paraguayans to salute and wish each other's happiness throughout the day, while also exchanging presents.\n\nAnother classic activity during this celebration, particularly among young students, but also among other general groups (coworkers, companies, civil organizations, etc.), is the game of the \"invisible friend\", which is a variation of the popular Secret Santa. One week before the celebration, participants are invited to write their names on a piece of paper and then, after scrambling all these pieces in a basket or container, retrieve one of the names, without revealing it to the others. Participants then become the \"invisible friend\" of the person on that piece of paper, and during the week before the celebration, they are invited to write anonymous small notes or letters to the person whose name they selected. On the day of the celebration, invisible friends bring presents to their friends, and one after the other, reveal their identities before giving their presents.\n\n"}

It is generally encouraged because it is more difficult to sit at this time when your body is exhausted from the entire day's routine.\n\nWhile most Yaza is performed after the last evening sitting, some is done early in the morning. If the practitioner is too tired to go on at night they can get up a few hours early in the morning. Because no alarm clocks are used during sesshin a good way for a person to get up for Yaza is to drink a good deal of water at bed time.

He was a firm opponent of materialism in science. He was a spiritual philosopher who defended the idea that religion and science are compatible at a time when the power of science was rising inexorably. His work is overshadowed in the English-speaking world by that of the more celebrated Henri Bergson. He was elected membership of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1912 to the Académie française.\n\nÉmile Boutroux was born at Montrouge, now in the Hauts-de-Seine \"département\", near Paris. He attended the lycée Napoléon (now lycée Henri IV), and graduated in 1865 to the École Normale Supérieure. He then continued his education at Heidelberg University between 1869–1870 where he was taught by Hermann von Helmholtz and encountered German philosophy.\n\nHis first employment was the post of philosophy professor at the lycée in Caen. In 1874 he published his book on which he based his doctoral thesis. \"The Contingency of the laws of the nature\" was an analysis of the implications of Kantian philosophy for science.\n\nBetween 1874 and 1876 Boutroux taught at the Faculty of Letters at the University of Nancy and while there he fell in love with and married Aline Poincaré the sister of the scientist and mathematician Henri Poincaré. In 1880 his son, Pierre, was born. Pierre Boutroux was himself to become a distinguished mathematician and historian of science.\n\nIn 1888 Boutroux was made professor of history of modern philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris.\n\nHe was elected a member of Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1902 he became Director of the Thiers Foundation, a residency for France's brightest students.
