The attorney is under an ethical obligation to disclose that legal decision, which is an adverse authority, to the court. This obligation is set forth in the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, §3.3.\n\nThe obligation to disclose adverse authority is in tension with the attorney's obligation to zealously represent the interests of the client. However, various public policy arguments have been set forth to explain why the attorney's duty of candor to the court with respect to such authority outweighs the duty to the client's cause. Ostensibly, the reason is to serve the law itself by preventing a court from making a decision that is erroneous in light of the authority revealed.\n\nAs a practical matter, an attorney who discovers adverse authority and fails to disclose it to the court may lose credibility with the court if the authority is found by opposing counsel, or by the court itself. The court may presume that an attorney who fails to disclose such authority has either been unethical in failing to disclose it, or has acted without diligence in failing to discover it. Moreover, the attorney disclosing such authority has the opportunity to frame the disclosure in a manner that seeks to diminish the impact of that authority by presenting arguments as to why it is inapplicable to the facts of the current case, or should be overturned altogether.\n\nIn order to fall within the obligation for disclosure, the matter must meet three conditions: it must be legal authority, it must be directly adverse, and it must be from a controlling jurisdiction.\n\nThe matter for which disclosure is compelled must be a matter of decided law, rather than a mere opinion rendered by an academic. For example, where an attorney is arguing that a certain transfer of assets should be permitted in a bankruptcy proceeding, that attorney need \"not\" disclose a law review article, casebook, or op-ed piece in which the author argues that exactly such a transfer of assets should never be permitted. Such a writing need not be disclosed even if the author of the article is a leading expert on the area of law, and the article contains strong and well-written arguments in support of the position.\n\nConversely, adverse authority \"does\" extend to binding legal materials other than court decisions, including statutes, local ordinances, and decisions of administrative bodies having adjudicative authority.\n\nThe requirement that the authority be directly adverse has been a source of uncertainty. Attorneys are keen to distinguish adverse authority by finding sufficient differences in the facts of previous adverse cases to argue that the previous case does not apply to the current situation. Such argument essentially seeks to present the prior authority as not being adverse at all, because it applies to sufficiently different facts. In order to counter the tendency of attorney's to diminish the precedential value of adverse authority, such authority is weighed by an objective standard in determining whether it should be disclosed. The standard is whether the judge sitting on the case would consider the authority to be important, or if she would feel misled if the authority were not disclosed.\n\nAdverse authority from another jurisdiction need not be disclosed. In state courts, that generally includes cases decided by courts of other states. In federal district courts, that generally includes cases decided by district courts in other federal districts, and by the federal courts of appeal other than the particular court of appeal that the district court falls under. State court decisions need not be reported to federal courts unless the federal court is deciding a matter that falls under state, rather than federal, law; decisions of federal courts other than the Supreme Court of the United States need not be reported to state courts.\n"}

May 1) 1804 in Moscow – October 5 (O.S. September 23), 1860 in Moscow) was a Russian theologian, philosopher, poet and amateur artist. He co-founded the Slavophile movement along with Ivan Kireyevsky, and he became one of its most distinguished theoreticians. \nHis son Nikolay Khomyakov was a speaker of the State Duma.\n\nKhomyakov's whole life was centred on Moscow. He viewed this \"thousand-domed city\" as the epitome of the Russian way of life. Equally successful as a landlord and conversationalist, he published very little during his lifetime. His writings, printed posthumously by his friends and disciples, exerted a profound influence on the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian lay philosophers, such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Konstantin Pobedonostsev, and Vladimir Solovyov. Alexander Herzen's \"My Past and Thoughts\" contains a delightful characterisation of Khomyakov.\n\nFor Khomyakov, socialism and capitalism were equally repugnant offspring of Western decadence. The West failed to solve human spiritual problems, as it stressed competition at the expense of co-operation. In his own words, \"Rome kept unity at the expense of freedom, while Protestants had freedom but lost unity\".\n\nKhomyakov's own ideals revolved around the term \"sobornost\", the Slavonic equivalent of \"catholicity\" found in the Nicene Creed; it can be loosely translated as \"togetherness\" or \"symphony\". Khomyakov viewed the Russian \"obshchina\" as a perfect example of sobornost and extolled the Russian peasants for their humility.\n\nKhomyakov died from cholera, infected by a peasant he had attempted to treat. He was buried next to his brother-in-law, Nikolai Yazykov, and another disciple, Nikolai Gogol, in the Danilov Monastery. The Soviets arranged for their disinterment and had them reburied at the new Novodevichy Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An alumnus of the University of Glasgow, he served as University chaplain from 1774 – 1794, and librarian from 1780 - 1794. Between 1780 and 1794 he worked as an assistant to Professor of Moral Philosophy Thomas Reid, taking on the latter's teaching duties, and succeeding him in 1796. \n\nHe was the eldest son of Andrew Arthur, a considerable farmer, and was born at Abbot's Inch, in Renfrewshire 6 September 1744. He entered the University of Glasgow in his thirteenth or fourteenth year, and in due course took his degree of M.A. Both before and after his appointment to a professorship he lectured with success in logic, botany, humanity, and church history. In October 1767, he received from the presbytery of Paisley his preacher's license, not, however, without some opposition on the ground of want of orthodoxy in the doctrines of the Church of Scotland. He was soon afterwards appointed chaplain to the University of Glasgow, and assistant minister with Dr. Craig of that city. He was also chosen librarian to the University, and held the office until nearly the close of his life.\n\nFor some years he was usefully employed in compiling a complete catalogue of the books, arranged in two parts, one under an alphabet of authors, and the other according to the position of the volumes on the shelves. The catalogue was printed in 1791, and described 20,000 volumes. It gave much satisfaction. Arthur was appointed assistant professor in moral philosophy through the influence of Dr. Thomas Reid, who was obliged to give up his full professorial duties on account of increasing years. This took place in May 1780, and Arthur taught the class for fifteen years in return for part of the salary. On the death of Reid, he was elected full professor, but held the office only for one session, dying on 14 June 1797. He never married, and died worth a considerable sum of money, which he left to his brothers and sisters. They devoted part of it to the publication of his posthumous \"Discourses on Theological and Literary Subjects\", which were edited, with a memoir by his friend William Richardson. The theological discourses include one on the argument for the existence of God, another on the goodness of God, and others on objections to David Hume, and similar topics; among the literary discourses are two upon theories of beauty, one on the arrangement of ancient and modern languages, and others on the study of ancient languages as a necessary branch of liberal education. Arthur had a shy and hesitating manner, but possessed liberal opinions to which he always had the courage to hold firm. A. F. Tytler, in a note upon a letter of Dr. Reid, remarks: \"Mr. Arthur, a man of learning, abilities, and worth, filled the chair of moral philosophy … with a reputation which did not disappoint the hopes of his respectable predecessor\". The \"Discourses\" \"give a very favourable idea of his talents, the justness of his taste, and the rectitude of his moral and religious principles\".\n\nHis works are:\n"}

{"id": "4031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4031", "title": "Buckminster Fuller", "text": "Buckminster Fuller\n\nRichard Buckminster \"Bucky\" Fuller (; July 12, 1895 – July 1, 1983) was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, inventor and futurist.\n\nFuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as \"Spaceship Earth\", \"Dymaxion\" house/car, ephemeralization, synergetic, and \"tensegrity\". He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known geodesic dome. Carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.\n\nFuller was the second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983.\n\nFuller was born on July 12, 1895, in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of Margaret Fuller, an American journalist, critic, and women's rights advocate associated with the American transcendentalism movement. The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.\n\nFuller spent much of his youth on Bear Island, in Penobscot Bay off the coast of Maine. He attended Froebelian Kindergarten. He had trouble with geometry, being unable to understand the abstraction that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical point, or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to infinity. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term \"invention\".\n\nYears later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a machinist's certification, and knew how to use the press brake, stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the sheet metal trade.\n\nFuller attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at Harvard College, where he was affiliated with Adams House. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a vaudeville troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his \"irresponsibility and lack of interest.\" By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.\n\nBetween his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile mill, and later as a laborer in the meat-packing industry. He also served in the U.S. Navy in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a crash rescue boat commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the Stockade Building System for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail in 1927.\n\nBuckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from polio and spinal meningitis just before her fourth birthday. Fuller dwelled on her death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers' damp and drafty living conditions. This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.\n\nIn 1927, at age 32, Fuller lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily and reflected upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide by drowning in Lake Michigan, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.\n\nFuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:\n\nFuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on \"an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity.\"\n\nSpeaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life. Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's Chronofile archives, housed at Stanford University. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.\n\nIn 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to \"the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them ... finding ways of \"doing more with less\" to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more.\" By 1928, Fuller was living in Greenwich Village and spending much of his time at the popular café Romany Marie's, where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and Eugene O'Neill several years earlier. Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals, giving informal lectures several times a week, and models of the Dymaxion house were exhibited at the café. Isamu Noguchi arrived during 1929—Constantin Brâncuși, an old friend of Marie's, had directed him there—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects, including the modeling of the Dymaxion car based on recent work by Aurel Persu. It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.\n\nFuller taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina during the summers of 1948 and 1949, serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the geodesic dome. Although the geodesic dome had been created 26 years earlier by Dr. Walther Bauersfeld, Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.\n\nOne of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at Bennington College in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an icosahedron. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the Marines. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.\n\nFuller's first \"continuous tension – discontinuous compression\" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students. These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.\n\nFor half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily diary (later called the \"Dymaxion Chronofile\"), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the Dymaxion car project.\n\nInternational recognition began with the success of huge geodesic domes during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at North Carolina State University in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies. Richard Lewontin, a new faculty member in population genetics at North Carolina State University, provided Fuller with computer calculations for the lengths of the domes' edges.\n\nFuller began working with architect Shoji Sadao in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller & Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large geodesic dome for the U.S. Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. This building is now the \"Montreal Biosphère\".\nIn 1962, the artist and searcher John McHale wrote the first monograph on Fuller, published by George Braziller in New York.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with John McHale. In 1965, they inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the International Union of Architects in Paris, which was, in Fuller's own words, devoted to \"applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity.\" Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at SIU Edwardsville, where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.\n\nFuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of \"omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity.\" Fuller referred to himself as \"the property of universe\" and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work \"the property of all humanity\". For his lifetime of work, the American Humanist Association named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.\n\nIn 1976, Fuller was a key participant at UN Habitat I, the first UN forum on human settlements.\n\nFuller was awarded 28 United States patents and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal from The Franklin Institute. Fuller was elected as an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1967, on the occasion of the 50th year reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he was expelled in his first year). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968. In 1968, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1970. In 1970, he received the Gold Medal award from the American Institute of Architects. In 1976, he received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. He also received numerous other awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom presented to him on February 23, 1983, by President Ronald Reagan.\nFuller's last filmed interview took place on April 3, 1983, in which he presented his analysis of Simon Rodia's Watts Towers as a unique embodiment of the structural principles found in nature. Portions of this interview appear in \"I Build the Tower,\" a documentary film on Rodia's architectural masterpiece.\n\nFuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: \"She is squeezing my hand!\" He then stood up, suffered a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nBuckminster Fuller was a Unitarian like his grandfather, Unitarian minister Arthur Buckminster Fuller, He was an early environmental activist. He was aware of the Earth's finite resources, and promoted a principle that he termed \"ephemeralization\", which according to futurist and Fuller disciple Stewart Brand, he coined to mean \"doing more with less\". Resources and waste from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced synergetics, a term which he used broadly as a metaphor for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term synergy became popular.\n\nFuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and he explored principles of energy and material efficiency in the fields of architecture, engineering and design. He cited François de Chardenèdes' opinion that petroleum, from the standpoint of its replacement cost out of our current energy \"budget\" (essentially, the net incoming solar flux), had cost nature \"over a million dollars\" per U.S. gallon (US$300,000 per litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings. An encapsulation quotation of his views might be, \"There is no energy crisis, only a crisis of ignorance.\"\n\nFuller was concerned about sustainability and human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the \"technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life,\" his analysis of the condition of \"Spaceship Earth\" caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. He declared: \"selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable ... War is obsolete.\" He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.\n\nFuller was influenced by Alfred Korzybski's idea of general semantics. In the 1950s, Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the Institute of General Semantics, and he delivered the annual Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture in 1955. Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book \"Synergetics\". The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.\n\nIn his 1970 book \"I Seem To Be a Verb\", he wrote: \"I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.\"\n\nFuller wrote that the natural analytic geometry of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous truss is cyclically tetrahedral.\n\nHe had become a guru of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as Drop City, the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 \"Dymaxion Award\" for \"poetically economic\" domed living structures.\n\nFuller was most famous for his lattice shell structures – geodesic domes, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by Walther Bauersfeld for the Zeiss-Planetarium, built some 28 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954), is the same design as Bauersfeld's.\n\nTheir construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple \"tensegrity\" structures (tetrahedron, octahedron, and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the Hugo Award-winning novel \"Stand on Zanzibar\" by John Brunner, in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of Manhattan, and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).\n\nThe Dymaxion car was a vehicle designed by Fuller, featured prominently at Chicago's 1933-1934 Century of Progress World's Fair. During the Great Depression, Fuller formed the \"Dymaxion Corporation\" and built three prototypes with noted naval architect Starling Burgess and a team of 27 workmen — using donated money as well as a family inheritance.\n\nFuller associated the word \"Dymaxion\" with much of his work, a portmanteau of the words dynamic\", maximum\", and \"tension\" to sum up the goal of his study, \"maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input.\"\n\nThe Dymaxion was not an automobile \"per se\", but rather the 'ground-taxying mode' of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive — an \"Omni-Medium Transport\" for air, land and water. Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities, and noted severe limitations in its handling. The team made constant improvements and refinements to the platform, and Fuller noted the Dymaxion \"was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements.\"\n\nThe bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight, and its platform featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° steering lock. Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation, bringing nearby traffic to a halt.\n\nShortly after launch, a prototype crashed after being hit by another car, killing the Dymaxion's driver. The other car was driven by a local politician and was illegally removed from the accident scene, leaving reporters who arrived subsequently to blame the Dymaxion's unconventional design — though investigations exonerated the prototype. Fuller would himself later crash another prototype with his young daughter aboard.\n\nDespite courting the interest of important figures from the auto industry, Fuller used his family inheritance to finish the second and third prototypes — eventually selling all three, dissolving \"Dymaxion Corporation\" and maintaining the Dymaxion was never intended as a commercial venture. One of the three original prototypes survives.\n\nFuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive Dymaxion house garnered much interest, but only two prototypes were ever produced. Here the term \"Dymaxion\" is used in effect to signify a \"radically strong and light tensegrity structure\". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened \"bell\" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.\n\nConceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in Wichita, Kansas, the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility. The design included a \"Go-Ahead-With-Life Room\" stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel \"through time and space.\" It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It looked ultramodern at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.\n\nIn 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named Triton City and published a report on the design the following year. Models of the city aroused the interest of President Lyndon B. Johnson who, after leaving office, had them placed in the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.\n\nIn 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in Otisco, New York. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to . The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron rebar set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.\n\nThe project was enabled by a grant underwritten by Syracuse University and sponsored by US Steel (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.\n\nFuller, along with co-cartographer Shoji Sadao, also designed an alternative projection map, called the Dymaxion map. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.\n\nIn the 1960s, Fuller developed the World Game, a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map, in which players attempt to solve world problems. The object of the simulation game is, in Fuller's words, to \"make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.\"\n\nBuckminster Fuller wore thick-lensed spectacles to correct his extreme hyperopia, a condition that went undiagnosed for the first five years of his life. Fuller's hearing was damaged during his Naval service in World War I and deteriorated during the 1960s. After experimenting with bullhorns as hearing aids during the mid-1960s, Fuller adopted electronic hearing aids from the 1970s onward.\n\nIn public appearances, Fuller always wore dark-colored suits, appearing like \"an alert little clergyman\". Previously, he had experimented with unconventional clothing immediately after his 1927 epiphany, but found that breaking social fashion customs made others devalue or dismiss his ideas. Fuller learned the importance of physical appearance as part of one's credibility, and decided to become \"the invisible man\" by dressing in clothes that would not draw attention to himself. With self-deprecating humor, Fuller described this black-suited appearance as resembling a \"second-rate bank clerk\".\n\nWriter Guy Davenport met him in 1965 and described him thus: \"He's a dwarf, with a worker's hands, all callouses and squared fingers. He carries an ear trumpet, of green plastic, with WORLD SERIES 1965 printed on it. His smile is golden and frequent; the man's temperament is angelic, and his energy is just a touch more than that of [Robert] Gallway (champeen runner, footballeur, and swimmer). One leg is shorter than the other, and the prescription shoe worn to correct the imbalance comes from a country doctor deep in the wilderness of Maine. Blue blazer, Khrushchev trousers, and a briefcase full of Japanese-made wonderments; ...\"\n\nFollowing his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture. In the 1960s and 1970s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office in Carbondale, one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in. In the 1970s, Fuller was only in 'homely' locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; his daughter's home in Pacific Palisades, California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits.\n\nIn the 1920s, Fuller experimented with polyphasic sleep, which he called \"Dymaxion sleep\". Inspired by the sleep habits of animals such as dogs and cats, Fuller worked until he was tired, and then slept short naps. This generally resulted in Fuller sleeping 30-minute naps every 6 hours. This allowed him \"twenty-two thinking hours a day\", which aided his work productivity. Fuller reportedly kept this Dymaxion sleep habit for two years, before quitting the routine because it conflicted with his business associates' sleep habits. Despite no longer personally partaking in the habit, in 1943 Fuller suggested Dymaxion sleep as a strategy that the United States could adopt to win World War II.\n\nDespite only practicing true polyphasic sleep for a period during the 1920s, Fuller was known for his stamina throughout his life. He was described as \"tireless\" by Barry Farrell in \"Life\" magazine, who noted that Fuller stayed up all night replying to mail during Farrell's 1970 trip to Bear Island. In his seventies, Fuller generally slept for 5–8 hours per night.\n\nFuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at Stanford University.\n\nIn his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply \"Bucky\".\n\nBuckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible. Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.\n\nFuller used the word \"Universe\" without the definite or indefinite articles (\"the\" or \"a\") and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that \"by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences.\"\n\nThe words \"down\" and \"up\", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words \"in\" and \"out\" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. \"I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going \"outstairs\" and \"instairs.\"' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'\"\n\n\"World-around\" is a term coined by Fuller to replace \"worldwide\". The general belief in a flat Earth died out in classical antiquity, so using \"wide\" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms \"sunsight\" and \"sunclipse\", replacing \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\" to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-Copernican celestial mechanics.\n\nFuller also invented the word \"livingry,\" as opposed to weaponry (or \"killingry\"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. \"The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.\"\n\nAs well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term \"tensegrity\" from \"tensional integrity\". \"Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.\"\n\n\"Dymaxion\" is a portmanteau of \"dynamic maximum tension\". It was invented about 1929 by two admen at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.\n\nFuller also helped to popularize the concept of Spaceship Earth: \"The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it.\"\n\nHis concepts and buildings include:\nAmong the many people who were influenced by Buckminster Fuller are:\nConstance Abernathy,\nRuth Asawa,\nJ. Baldwin,\nMichael Ben-Eli,\nPierre Cabrol,\nJohn Cage,\nJoseph Clinton,\nPeter Floyd,\nMedard Gabel,\nMichael Hays,\nDavid Johnston,\nRobert Kiyosaki,\nPeter Jon Pearce,\nShoji Sadao,\nEdwin Schlossberg,\nKenneth Snelson,\nRobert Anton Wilson and Stewart Brand.\n\nAn allotrope of carbon, fullerene—and a particular molecule of that allotrope C (buckminsterfullerene or buckyball) has been named after him. The Buckminsterfullerene molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller's geodesic dome. The 1996 Nobel prize in chemistry was given to Kroto, Curl, and Smalley for their discovery of the fullerene.\n\nHe is quoted in the lyric of \"The Tower of Babble\" in the musical \"Godspell\": \"Man is a complex of patterns and processes.\"\n\nThe indie band Driftless Pony Club named their 2011 album, \"Buckminster\", after him. All the songs within the album are based upon his life and works.\n\nOn July 12, 2004, the United States Post Office released a new commemorative stamp honoring R. Buckminster Fuller on the 50th anniversary of his patent for the geodesic dome and by the occasion of his 109th birthday. The stamp's design replicated the January 10, 1964 cover of \"Time Magazine\".\n\nFuller was the subject of two documentary films: \"The World of Buckminster Fuller\" (1971) and \"\" (1996). Additionally, filmmaker Sam Green and the band Yo La Tengo collaborated on a 2012 \"live documentary\" about Fuller, \"The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller\".\n\nIn June 2008, the Whitney Museum of American Art presented \"Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe\", the most comprehensive retrospective to date of his work and ideas. The exhibition traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2009. It presented a combination of models, sketches, and other artifacts, representing six decades of the artist's integrated approach to housing, transportation, communication, and cartography. It also featured the extensive connections with Chicago from his years spent living, teaching, and working in the city.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki's 2015 book \"Second Chance\" is largely about Kiyosaki's interactions with Fuller, and Fuller's unusual final book \"Grunch of Giants\".\n\nIn 2012, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art hosted \"The Utopian Impulse\" – a show about Buckminster Fuller's influence in the Bay Area. Featured were concepts, inventions and designs for creating \"free energy\" from natural forces, and for sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. The show ran January through July.\n\nIn a different note, Fuller's quote \"Those who play with the Devil's toys, will be brought by degree to wield his sword\" was used and referenced as the first display seen in the strategy sci-fi video game \"\" developed by Firaxis Games.\n\n\"The House of Tomorrow\", is a 2017 American independent drama film written and directed by Peter Livolsi, based on Peter Bognanni's 2010 novel of the same name, featuring Asa Butterfield, Alex Wolff, Nick Offerman, Maude Apatow, and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn's character is obsessed by all things Buckminster Fuller providing retro-futurist tours of her geodesic home, including authentic video of Buckminster Fuller talking and sailing with Ellen Burstyn, who'd actually befriended him in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible.

Constance Jones, was an English philosopher and educator. She worked in logic and ethics.\n\nEmily Elizabeth Constance Jones was born at Langstone Court, Llangarren, Herefordshire to John Jones and his wife, Emily, daughter of Thomas Oakley JP, of Monmouthshire. She was the eldest of ten children. Constance was mostly tutored at home. She spent her early teenage years with her family in Cape Town, South Africa, and when they returned to England in 1865 she attended a small school, Miss Robinson's, in Cheltenham, for a year.\n\nShe was coached for the entrance examination for Girton College, Cambridge by Miss Alice Grüner, a former student of Newnham at her home in Sydenham, Kent. She went up to Girton in 1875 where, prompted by having read Henry Fawcett's \"Political Economy\" (1863) and Mill's \"Logic\" (1843), she chose the Moral Sciences Tripos. However, she almost immediately had to withdraw in order to look after the aunt with whom she then lived. Her undergraduate career was considerably interrupted because the education of her younger brothers took precedence over her own, but despite this in 1880 she was awarded a first class in the Moral Sciences Tripos.\n\nShe returned to Girton in 1884 as a research student and a resident lecturer in Moral Sciences. Having studied with Henry Sidgwick, James Ward and J.N. Keynes, she completed the translation of Lotze's \"Mikrokosmus\" initiated by Elizabeth Hamilton. She also edited Henry Sidgwick's \"Methods of Ethics\" (1901) and his \"Ethics of Green, Spencer, and Martineau\" (1902); and wrote \"Elements of Logic\" (1890); \"A Primer of Logic\" (1905); \"A Primer of Ethics\" (1909); \"A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearing\" (1911); \"Girton College\" (1913). She was Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge, from 1903 until her retirement in 1916.\n\nJones was one of the first women to join the Aristotelian Society in 1892, serving on the Society's Executive Committee from 1914 to 1916. She was also the first woman recorded as having delivered a paper to the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club. She spoke about James Ward's \"Naturalism and Agnosticism\" on 1 December 1899, with the philosopher Henry Sidgwick chairing the meeting. Her views were regarded as original and influenced her colleagues. She spent her career developing the idea that categorical propositions are composed of a predicate and a subject related via identity or non-identity.\n\nConstance Jones' most significant contribution to philosophy was in logic and she was widely regarded to be an authority in this area by her contemporaries. Her major work is \"A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearings\" (Cambridge, 1911). She was chiefly concerned with the import and interpretation of propositions. G.F. Stout says of her: \"She did good service in insisting on the distinction between interpretation from the point of view of the speaker and that of the hearer\". In her autobiography, Jones wrote of an early fascination with issues related to the nature and structure of content:\n\"This unsettled question—what is asserted when you make a statement, and what is the proper form of statement?—had deeply interested me from the time when I was a student and puzzled over Mill's and Jevons' accounts of propositions\".\nJones published several textbooks on logic and numerous articles on logic and ethics, particularly on Sidgwick's ethical hedonism. However, despite her contribution to analytic philosophy she has become largely forgotten.\n\n"}
{"id": "19086594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19086594", "title": "Debate about Cambrian lophotrochozoans", "text": "Debate about Cambrian lophotrochozoans\n\nSince 1990 there has been intense debate among paleontologists about the evolution in the Early Cambrian period of the \"super-phylum\" Lophotrochozoa, which is thought to include the modern molluscs, annelid worms and brachiopods, as well as their evolutionary \"aunts\" and \"cousins\".\n\nThe name \"halwaxiid\" was formed by combining the names of two members of the proposed group, \"Halkieria\" and \"Wiwaxia\". The group was defined as a set of Early to Mid Cambrian animals that had: a \"chain mail\" coat of three concentric bands of small armor plates that are called sclerites; in some cases, a small cap-like shell at the front end and in some cases both ends. Some scientists are unhappy with this loose definition, arguing that such traits may have arisen convergently rather being inherited from a common ancestor. This objection suggests that the group is not monophyletic, in other words that the group does not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor. In fact the originators of the term \"halwaxiid\" prefer an evolutionary \"family tree\" in which the halwaxiids are not monophyletic.\n\nOther fossil organisms became involved in the debate as there were plausible arguments for considering them closely related to the halkieriids or \"Wiwaxia\" or both. One was the more recently discovered \"Orthrozanclus\", which looked an intermediate between the halkieriids and \"Wiwaxia\" as it had a shell like that of halkieriids, and unmineralized sclerites and long spines like those of \"Wiwaxia\" – in fact the article which first described \"Orthrozanclus\" introduced the term \"halwaxiid\". New finds of \"Odontogriphus\" put this animal into play as well since, despite its lack of sclerites or shells, its feeding apparatus looks very like \"Wiwaxia\"’s. The siphogonotuchids, a very Early Cambrian group known only from isolated sclerites among the small shelly fossils, also appear in analyses as their sclerites suggest this group may have been close to the ancestors of halkieriids.\n\nSince 1995 several phylogenies, or evolutionary \"family trees\", have been suggested for these organisms. The position of \"Wiwaxia\" is highlighted, since the position of this organism has been central to the debate since 1990.\n\nThe most intense part of the debate centers round \"Wiwaxia\". Conway Morris (1985) originally dismissed the earliest classification of \"Wiwaxia\" as a polychaete worm, because he thought there was little structural similarity between a polychaete's scale-like elytra and \"Wiwaxia\"’s sclerites, and because the arrangement of the sclerites, with quite different numbers in each band, showed no sign of the regular segmentation that is a feature of polychaetes. Instead he thought \"Wiwaxia\" was very similar to shell-less aplacophoran molluscs, that it must have moved on a mollusc-like muscular foot, and that its feeding apparatus looked like a primitive form of the molluscan radula, a tooth-bearing chitinous \"tongue\". Hence he classified it as a \"sister\" of the molluscs. When he briefly described the first articulated specimens of \"Halkieria\" in 1990, Conway Morris wrote of \"the halkieriid-wiwaxiid body plan\" and that the halkieriids might be close relatives of molluscs.\nShortly after this in 1990 Butterfield published his first paper on \"Wiwaxia\". He argued that, since \"Wiwaxia\"’s sclerites appeared to be solid, they were not similar to the hollow sclerites of halkieriids. In fact he thought they were more similar to the chitinous bristles (setae) that project from the bodies of modern annelids and in some genera form leaf-like scales that cover the back like roof tiles - in composition, in detailed structure, in how they were attached to the body via follicle-like pockets in the skin, and in overall appearance. He also contended that Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus, instead of being mounted in the middle of its \"head\", was just as likely to be mounted in two parts on the sides of the \"head\", an arrangement that is common in polychaetes. He therefore classified \"Wiwaxia\" as a polychaete.\n\nConway Morris and Peel (1995) largely accepted Butterfield's arguments and treated \"Wiwaxia\" as an ancestor or \"aunt\" of the polychaetes. However they maintained that Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus was much more like a molluscan radula. They also argued that Wiwaxia was fairly closely related to and in fact descended from the halkieriids, as the sclerites are divided into similar groups, although those of halkieriids were much smaller, more numerous and hollow. They wrote that in 1994 Butterfield had found \"Wiwaxia\" sclerites that were clearly hollow. The cladogram they presented showed the halkieriids split into three groups: one as \"aunts\" of brachiopods, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the lophophore; the second group of halkieriids as \"aunts\" of both \"Wiwaxia\" and annelid worms; and the earliest halkieriids as \"great aunts\" of all of these.\n\nMarine biologist Amélie H. Scheltema \"et al.\" (2003) argued that \"Wiwaxia\"’s feeding apparatus is very similar to the radulas of some modern shell-less aplacophoran molluscs, and that the sclerites of the two groups are very similar. They concluded that \"Wiwaxia\" was a member of a clade that includes molluscs.\nDanish zoologist Danny Eibye-Jacobsen (2004) regarded bristles as a feature shared by molluscs, annelids and brachiopods. Hence even if \"Wiwaxia\"’s sclerites closely resembled bristles, which he doubted, this would not prove that \"Wiwaxia\"’s closest relative were annelids. He also pointed out that the very different numbers of sclerites in the various zones of \"Wiwaxia\"’s body do not correspond to any reasonable pattern of segmentation. Since in his opinion \"Wiwaxia\" lacked other clearly polychaete features, he regarded this as an argument against classifying \"Wiwaxia\" as a polychaete. In his opinion there were no strong grounds for classifying \"Wiwaxia\" as a proto-annelid or a proto-mollusc.\n\nCaron, Scheltema \"et al.\" (2006), in a paper about newly discovered and good specimens of \"Odontogriphus\", thought \"Wiwaxia\" bore little resemblance to polychaetes as it showed no signs of the segmentation, appendages in front of the mouth, or \"legs\" – all of which are typical polychaete features. On the other hand they thought the teeth on the feeding apparatus of both \"Wiwaxia\" and \"Odontogriphus\" strongly resembled those of a modern group of molluscs, Neomeniomorpha. Hence they classified \"Wiwaxia\" as an \"aunt\" and \"Odontogriphus\" as a \"great aunt\" of molluscs.\n\nButterfield returned to the debate in 2006, repeating the arguments he presented in 1990 for regarding \"Wiwaxia\" as an early polychaete and adding that, while bristles are a feature of several groups, they appear as a covering over the back only in polychaetes. He also questioned whether the two or three rows of teeth in \"Wiwaxia\" and \"Odontogriphus\" could function in the same way as the belt-like molluscan radula with its many tooth-rows; on the other hand one group of polychaetes uses a single two-part \"jaw\" to scrape food off a substrate. While he agreed that \"Wiwaxia\" and \"Odontogriphus\" were very similar, he wrote, \"… it certainly does not require that they be shoehorned into the same lineage. … the seemingly trivial distinction between these two taxa is exactly what is expected at the divergence points leading from a last common ancestor to extant phyla.\"\n\nButterfield (2006) accepted that \"Wiwaxia\" and \"Odontogriphus\" were closely related, but argued that they were stem-group polychaetes rather than stem-group molluscs. In his opinion the feeding apparatus of these organisms, with consisted of two or at most four rows of teeth, could not perform the functions of the \"belt-like\" molluscan radula with their numerous tooth-rows; the different tooth-rows in both \"Wiwaxia\" and \"Odontogriphus\" tooth-rows also have noticeably different shapes, while those of molluscan radulae are produced one after the other by the same group of \"factory\" cells and therefore are almost identical. He also regarded lines running across the middle region of \"Odontogriphus\" fossils as evidence of external segmentation, since the lines are evenly spaced and run exactly at right angles to the long axis of the body. As in his earlier papers, Butterfield emphasized the similarities of internal structure between \"Wiwaxia\"’s sclerites and the bristles of polychaetes, and the fact that polychaetes are the only modern organisms in which some of the bristles form a covering over the back.\n\nIn 2007 Conway Morris and Caron described a new fossil, \"Orthrozanclus\", which had a mineralized shell like that of halkieriids, and unmineralized sclerites and long spines like those of \"Wiwaxia\" – and, like both of these, a soft underside which they interpreted as a muscular foot, and a similar arrangement of the sclerites into three concentric bands. Some of \"Orthrozanclus\"’s sclerites appear to have been hollow, as the specimen includes what look like internal castings. They took this find as evidence that the halkieriids, \"Wiwaxia\" and \"Orthrozanclus\" were very closely related and formed the group \"halwaxiids\". However the simplest \"family tree\" faces an obstacle: the siphogonuchitids appear in earlier rocks and had \"mineralized\" sclerites. Hence Conway Morris and Caron found it necessary to consider two more complex family trees, concluding that \"Hypothesis 1\" fitted the available data better, but fell apart if there were minor changes in the characteristics used:\n\nConway Morris and Caron (2007) published the first description of \"Orthrozanclus reburrus\". This resembled the halkieriids in having concentric bands of sclerites, although only two and not mineralized; and \"one\" shell at what was presumed to be the front and which was similar in shape to \"Halkieria\"’s front shell. It also had long spines rather like those of \"Wiwaxia\". Conway Morris and Caron regarded this creature as evidence that the \"halwaxiids\" were a valid taxon and were monophyletic, in other words shared a common ancestor with each other and with no other organism. They published \"two\" cladograms, representing alternative hypotheses about the evolution of the lophotrochozoa, the lineage that includes molluscs, annelids and brachiopods:\n\nMost of the debate has been about halkieriids' relationship to molluscs, annelids and brachiopods. However a paper published in 2008 argued that halkieriids were closely related to chancelloriids, which have been generally regarded as sponges.\n\nHalkieriid sclerites were known for a long time as elements of the small shelly fossils. The first articulated specimens, with all their hard parts together, were collected in 1989 and were described briefly in 1990 by Conway Morris and Peel (1990). The same authors produced a more detailed analysis in 1995, which divided the halkieriids into three groups: one as \"aunts\" of brachiopods, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the lophophore; the second group of halkieriids as \"aunts\" of both \"Wiwaxia\" and annelid worms; and the earliest halkieriids as \"great aunts\" of all of these.\n\nIn 2003 Cohen, Holmer and Luter supported the halkieriid-brachiopod relationship, suggesting that brachiopods may have arisen from a halkieriid lineage that developed a shorter body and larger shells, and then folded itself and finally grew a stalk out of what used to be the back.\n\nVinther and Nielsen (2005) proposed instead that \"Halkieria\" was a crown group mollusc, in other words more similar to modern molluscs than to annelids, brachiopods or any intermediate groups. They argued that: \"Halkieria\"’s sclerites resembled those of the modern solenogaster aplacophoran shell-less molluscs, of some modern polyplacophoran molluscs, which have several shell plates, and of the Ordovician polyplacophoran \"Echinochiton\"; \"Halkieria\"’s shells are more similar to the shells of conchiferan molluscs, since shells of both of these groups show no trace of the canals and pores seen in polyplacophoran shell plates; the bristles of brachiopods and annelids are similar to each other but not to \"Halkieria\"’s sclerites.\n\nHowever Conway Morris (2006) criticized Vinther and Nielsen's classification of \"Halkieria\" as a crown group mollusc, on the grounds that the growth of the spicules in the aplacophorans and polyplacophorans is not similar to the method of growth deduced for the complex halkieriid sclerites; in particular, he said, the hollow spines of various molluscs are not at all like the halkieriid sclerites with their complex internal channels. Conway Morris repeated his earlier conclusion that halkieriids were close to the ancestors of both molluscs and brachiopods.\n\nIn their description of the newly discovered \"Orthrozanclus\" (2007), which has similarities to both \"Wiwaxia\" and the halkieriids, Conway Morris and Caron also took account of the siphogonuchitids, a group known only from isolated mineralized sclerites that resemble those of the halkieriids. They proposed the two \"family trees\" described above:\n\nPorter (2008) revived an early 1980s idea that the sclerites of \"Halkieria\" are extremely similar to those of chancelloriids. These were sessile, bag-like, radially symmetric organisms with an opening at the top.\n\nSince their fossils show no signs of a gut or other organs, chancelloriids were originally classified as some kind of sponge. Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related to sponges on the grounds that the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in modern keratose (horny) demosponges. However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) opposed this view on several grounds, including that: the silica-based spines of demosponges are solid, while chancellorid sclerites are hollow, probably made of aragonite, and filled with soft tissues connected to the rest of the animal at the bases of the sclerites; sponges have loosely bound-together skins called pinacoderms, which are only one cell thick, while the skins of chancellorids were much thicker and show signs of connective structures called belt desmosomes. In their opinion the presence of belt desmosomes made chancellorids members of the Epitheliazoa, the next higher taxon above the Porifera, to which sponges belong. They thought it was difficult to say whether chancellorids were members of the Eumetazoa, \"true animals\" whose tissues are organized into Germ layers: chancellorids' lack of internal organs would seem to exclude them from the Eumetazoa; but possibly chancellorids were descended from Eumetazoans that lost these features after becoming sessile filter-feeders.\n\nThe sclerites of halkieriids and chancelloriids resemble each other at all levels: both have an internal \"pulp cavity\" and a thin external organic layer; the walls are made of the same material, aragonite; the arrangement of the aragonite fibers in each is the same, running mainly from base to tip but with each being closer to the surface at the end nearest the tip. It is extremely improbable that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related. This dilemma may be resolved in various ways:\n"}

After completing secondary school at the Liceo Alemán del Verbo Divino in Santiago (1951–1963), like his mentor Humberto Maturana, Varela temporarily studied medicine at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and graduated with a degree in biology from the University of Chile. He later obtained a Ph.D. in biology at Harvard University. His thesis, defended in 1970 and supervised by Torsten Wiesel, was titled \"Insect Retinas: Information processing in the compound eye\".\n\nAfter the 1973 military coup led by Augusto Pinochet, Varela and his family spent 7 years in exile in the United States before he returned to Chile to become a professor of biology at the Universidad de Chile.\n\nVarela became familiar, by practice, with Tibetan Buddhism in the 1970s, initially studying, together with Keun-Tshen Goba (\"né\" Ezequiel Hernandez Urdaneta), with the meditation master Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, founder of Vajradhatu and Shambhala Training, and later with Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a Nepalese meditation master of higher tantras.\n\nIn 1986, he settled in France, where he first taught cognitive science and epistemology at the École Polytechnique, and later neuroscience at the University of Paris. From 1988 until his death, he led a research group, as Director of Research at the CNRS (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique).\n\nIn 1987, Varela, along with R. Adam Engle, founded the Mind and Life Institute, initially to sponsor a series of dialogues between scientists and the Dalai Lama about the relationship between modern science and Buddhism. The Institute continues today as a major nexus for such dialog as well as promoting and supporting multidisciplinary scientific investigation in mind sciences, contemplative scholarship and practice and related areas in the interface of science with meditation and other contemplative practices, especially Buddhist practices.\n\nVarela died in 2001 in Paris of Hepatitis C after having written an account of his 1998 liver transplant. Varela had four children, including the actress, environmental spokesperson, and model Leonor Varela.\n\nVarela was trained as a biologist, mathematician and philosopher through the influence of different teachers, Humberto Maturana and Torsten Wiesel.\n\nHe wrote and edited a number of books and numerous journal articles in biology, neurology, cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy. He founded, with others, the Integral Institute, a thinktank dedicated to the cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines.\n\nVarela supported embodied philosophy, viewing human cognition and consciousness in terms of the enactive structures in which they arise. These comprise the body (as a biological system and as personally experienced) and the physical world with which it interacts. \n\nVarela's work popularized within the field of neuroscience the concept of neurophenomenology. This concept combined the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, with \"first person science.\" Neurophenomenology requires observers to examine their own conscious experience using scientifically verifiable methods.\n\n\nVarela wrote numerous books and articles:\n\nSarat Maharaj & Francisco Varela in conversation: \"Ahamkara\".

{"id": "28326023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28326023", "title": "Great Goddess hypothesis", "text": "Great Goddess hypothesis\n\nThe Great Goddess Hypothesis is that in Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and/or Neolithic Europe and Western Asia and North Africa, a singular, monotheistic female deity was worshipped prior to the development of the polytheistic pagan religions of the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Having first been proposed as an idea relating to ancient Greek religion in 1849, it subsequently achieved some support amongst classicists. In the early 20th century, various historians began to postulate about the theory applying across Europe, and it was widely propagated by the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas in the 1980s. It has since been adopted by various feminist religious groups such as Dianic Wicca as a part of the mythology of their faith.\n\nThe theory had been first proposed by the German Classicist Eduard Gerhard in 1849, when he speculated that the various goddesses found in ancient Greek paganism had been representations of a singular goddess who had been worshipped far further back into prehistory. He associated this deity with the concept of Mother Earth, which itself had only been developed in the 18th century by members of the Romanticist Movement. Soon after, this theory began to be adopted by other classicists in France and Germany, such as Ernst Kroker, Fr. Lenormant and M.J. Menant, who further brought in the idea that the ancient peoples of Anatolia and Mesopotamia had influenced the Greek religion, and that therefore they also had once venerated a great goddess. These ideas amongst various classicists echoed those of the Swiss judge J.J. Bachofen, who put forward the idea that the earliest human societies were matriarchal, but had converted to a patriarchal form in later prehistory. Commenting on this idea, the historian Ronald Hutton (1999) remarked that in the eyes of many at the time, it would have been an obvious conclusion that \"what was true in a secular sphere should also, logically, have been so in the religious one.\"\n\nIn 1901, the archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans—who in an 1895 work had dismissed the Great Goddess theory—changed his mind and accepted the idea whilst excavating at Knossos on Crete, the site of the Bronze Age Minoan civilisation. After unearthing a number of female figurines, he came to believe that they all represented a singular goddess, who was the Minoan's chief deity, and that all the male figurines found on the site represented a subordinate male god who was both her son and consort, an idea that he based partially upon the later classical myth of Rhea and Zeus. In later writings in ensuing decades he went on to associate these Neolithic and Bronze Age images with other goddesses around the Near East. As Hutton pointed out, \"his influence made this the orthodoxy of Minoan archaeology, although there was always a few colleagues who pointed out that it placed a strain upon the evidence.\"\n\nIn 1903, Sir Edmund Chambers, a respected amateur historian of the mediaeval period, published \"The Medieval Stage\", in which he diverted from his main theme to state how he believed that in prehistory, humans had worshipped a Great Earth Mother as a twofold deity who was both the creator and the destroyer. That same year, the classicist Jane Ellen Harrison espoused a similar idea, but claimed that this prehistoric Great Goddess had been divided into three forms—she theorised this based upon the fact that in various recorded polytheistic European religions, there were a set of three goddesses, such as the Fates and the Graces. Harrison identified two of these as the Maiden, who ruled over the living, and the Mother, who ruled the underworld, and like Evans believed that a male god who was both her lover and son was also worshipped.\n\n"}
{"id": "4059063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4059063", "title": "Heroic virtue", "text": "Heroic virtue\n\nHeroic virtue is a phrase coined by Augustine of Hippo to describe the virtue of early Christian martyrs and used by the Catholic Church. The Greek pagan term hero described a person with possibly superhuman abilities and great goodness, and \"it connotes a degree of bravery, fame, and distinction which places a man high above his fellows\". The term was later applied to other highly virtuous persons who do extraordinary good works.\n\nHeroic virtue is one of the requirements for beatification in the Catholic Church. The modern process for declaring heroic virtue is internal to the church and conducted by those in senior positions.\n\nQuoting the Catholic view from the article on Heroic Virtue by J. Wilhelm in the 1917 \"Catholic Encyclopedia\":\nTogether with the four cardinal virtues the Christian saint must be endowed with the three theological virtues, especially with Divine charity, the virtue which informs all other virtues.\n\nAs charity stands at the summit of all virtues, so faith stands at their foundation. For by faith God is first apprehended, and the soul lifted up to supernatural life. Faith is the secret of one's conscience; to the world it is made manifest by the good works in which it lives, \"Faith without works is dead\" (James 2:2). Such works are: the external profession of faith, strict observance of the Divine commands, prayer, filial devotion to the Church, the fear of God, the horror of sin, penance for sins committed, patience in adversity, etc. All or any of these attain the grade of heroicity when practiced with unflagging perseverance, during a long period of time, or under circumstances so trying that by them men of but ordinary perfection would be deterred from acting.\n\nHope is a firm trust that God will give us eternal life and all the means necessary to obtain it; it attains heroicity when it amounts to unshakeable confidence and security in God's help throughout all the untoward events of life, when it is ready to forsake and sacrifice all other goods in order to obtain the promised felicity of heaven.\n\nCharity inclines man to love God above all things with the love of friendship. The perfect friend of God says with St. Paul: \"With Christ I am nailed to the cross. And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me\" (Galatians 2:19-20). For love means union. Its type in heaven is the Divine Trinity in Unity; its highest degree in God's creatures is the beatific vision, i.e. participation in God's life. On earth it is the fruitful mother of holiness, the one thing necessary, the one all-sufficient possession. It is extolled in I Cor., xiii, and in St. John's Gospel and Epistles; the beloved disciple and the fiery missionary of the cross are the best interpreters of the mystery of love revealed to them in the Heart of Jesus. With the commandment to love God above all Jesus coupled another: \"And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these\" (Mark 12:31). The likeness, or the linking of the two commandments, lies in this: that in our neighbor we love God's image and likeness, His adopted children and the heirs of His Kingdom. Hence, serving our neighbor is serving God. And the works of spiritual and temporal mercy performed in this world will decide our fate in the next: \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom. . .For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. . .Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me\" ().\n\nPrudence, which enables us to know what to desire or to avoid, attains heroicity when it coincides with the \"gift of counsel\", i.e. a clear, Divinely aided insight into right and wrong conduct.\n\nJustice, which gives every one his due, is the pivot on which turn the virtues of religion, piety, obedience, gratitude, truthfulness, friendship, and many more. Jesus sacrificing His life to give God His due, Abraham willing to sacrifice his son in obedience to God's will, these are acts of heroic justice.\n\nFortitude, which urges us on when difficulty stands in the way of our duty, is itself the heroic element in the practice of virtue; it reaches its apex when it overcomes obstacles which to ordinary virtue are insurmountable.\n\nTemperance, which restrains us when passions urge us to what is wrong, comprises becoming deportment, modesty, abstinence, chastity, sobriety, and others.\n\n\"In fine\" it should be remarked that almost every act of virtue proceeding from the Divine principle within us has in it the elements of all the virtues; only mental analysis views the same act under various aspects.\n\n"}

Homologous behaviors can theoretically be of at least two different varieties. As with homologous anatomical characteristics, behaviors present in different species can be considered homologous if they are likely present in those species because the behaviors were present in a common ancestor of the two species. Alternatively, in much the same way as reproductive structures (e.g., the penis and the clitoris) are considered homologous because they share a common origin in embryonic tissues, behaviors—or the neural substrates associated with those behaviors—can also be considered homologous if they share common origins in development.\n\nBehavioral homologies have been considered since at least 1958, when Konrad Lorenz studied the evolution of behavior. More recently, the question of behavioral homologies has been addressed by philosophers of science such as Marc Ereshefsky, psychologists such as Drew Rendall, and neuroscientists such as Georg Striedter and Glenn Northcutt. It is debatable whether the concept of homology is useful in developmental psychology.\n\nFor example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman primates, argue that patterns of behaviour in dominance hierarchies are homologous across the primates.\n"}

Raymond L. Middleton, Warden v. Sally Marie McNeil is a California case that espouses this doctrine. The 2012 Florida Statutes lay measurable conditions to determine if the \"fear of imminent peril\" is reasonable under the law. Both the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Law Commission (ILC) have recognized the profound motivations of one's lawful fear of imminent peril and have adopted measures to define consequences, of self-defense against such peril, as reasonable.\n\nPeril is synonymous with danger but lacks the suddenness of the \"imminent\" qualifier. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates safety standards for workplaces in the United States. Its charter obligation is to identify dangerous conditions in the workplace with a potential for sudden peril, and to require employers to actively mitigate the risks.\n\n"}

She has taught at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Hughes Hall, Cambridge, King's College, London, St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and Melbourne University. She is a barrister of the High Court of Australia and a solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales.\n\nBorn in Scotland and educated in Calcutta, India, and Canberra, Australia, she took degrees in philosophy and law at the Australian National University, clerked to a judge in Canberra and won a Commonwealth scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, where she undertook a doctorate on the concept of intention in the law of homicide under the direction of John Finnis.\n\nLaing’s interests lie in the field of jurisprudence and applied ethics. Commenting on contemporary moral conundrums she applies natural law thinking to questions about the family, life and death, and the limits of legal regulation. On the subject of voluntary euthanasia she argues that institutionalizing medically assisted death erodes respect for human life, endangers the vulnerable and disabled, underestimates human capacity for error and vice and is intrinsically discriminatory. She argues that it plays into the hands of illicit interests and trades on an improper understanding of human autonomy. She warns against dismissing \"the army of corporate, financial, medical and political interests that there are in controlling death, euthanasia’s corrosive effects on public and professional attitudes, and the discrimination implicit in its implementation.\" Of the vested interests that there are in controlling death she says:\n\nShe regards the practice a threat to the elderly, disabled and terminally ill: \n\nShe asserts that voluntary euthanasia logically collapses into involuntary and non-voluntary euthanasia, and that this reality, widely dismissed as a fallacious slippery slope argument, is borne out by Dutch and Belgian statistics demonstrating widespread non-consensual euthanasia, false reporting and under-reporting.\n\nA critic of the Bland Case, she has highlighted the problem of passive euthanasia by incentivised and managerialised sedation-and-dehydration in hospitals (Royal Society of Medicine, London W1 18 June 2012), a position that provoked revealing Freedom of Information Act requests which in turn led to the 2012-13 inquiry into the problem in the UK. In \"Food and Fluids: Human Law, Human Rights and Human Interests\" she argues that financial, medical, and political interests are bound to incentivise and invite homicide of the vulnerable. An early critic of what she terms the sedation-dehydration regimes, she writes of the Liverpool Care Pathway:\n\nA critic of utilitarianism, in \"Innocence and Consequentialism\" she argued in 1996 that utilitarianism has insufficient conceptual apparatus to comprehend the very idea of innocence, a feature central to any comprehensive ethical theory. In particular, Peter Singer on her view, cannot without contradicting himself reject baby farming (a thought experiment that involves mass-producing deliberately brain damaged children for live birth for the greater good of organ harvesting) and at the same time hold on to his \"personism\" a term coined by Jenny Teichman to describe his fluctuating (and Laing says, irrational and discriminatory) theory of human moral value. His explanation that baby farming undermines attitudes of care and concern for the very young, can be applied to babies and the unborn (both ‘non-persons’ who may be killed, on his view) and contradicts positions that he adopts elsewhere in his work.\n\nLaing contends that the practice of eugenics has not disappeared. Conceptually related to the utilitarian and Social Darwinist worldview and historically evolving out of the practice of slavery, it led to some of the most spectacular human rights abuses in history. The compulsory sterilization of and experimentation on those deemed \"undesirable\" and \"unfit\" in many technologically developed states like the US, Scandinavia, and Japan, led inexorably and most systematically to Nazi Germany with the elimination of countless millions of people for their race, class, political views, sexuality, religion or disability. She argues that the new eugenics adopted by John Harris, Julian Savulescu and others, collapses into the old variety because of its fixation on producing \"the better\" or even more implausibly, \"the best\". It was this very idea that drove much of the injustice of the twentieth century. Ethically questionable strategies were at the time viewed as progressive and socially evolutionary. The new eugenics, she thinks, fares no better and spells disaster for people regarded as deficient in some way. She rejects the idea that autonomous efforts to choose \"better\" or the \"best\" children are less problematic for being freely chosen.\nThe fact that one freely chooses to give one’s children away into slavery or lethal medical experimentation or to create a hundred clones of oneself, is no bar to the action’s being independently at odds with intergenerational justice and the common good. She suggests that mistake, ignorance, misinformation, propaganda and behaviour modification techniques, subliminal or otherwise, are celebrated ways of getting people to act freely in ways that undermine intergenerational justice and the common good. Laing suggests that biometric databases and identity cards exposing one’s medical data, DNA defects, IQ, and political views, while in many ways proving socially useful, demonstrate how vulnerable humans are, not just at the hands of political misfeasors and tyrants but insurance companies, government and corporate snoopers, and determined social and bioethical engineers.\n"}
{"id": "704101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=704101", "title": "Jallikattu", "text": "Jallikattu\n\n' (or '), also known as ' and ', is a traditional spectacle in which a \"Bos indicus\" bull, such as the Pulikulam or Kangayam breeds, is released into a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull's back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. Participants hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases, participants must ride long enough to remove flags on the bull's horns.\n\nAs there were events of injury and death associated with the sport, both to the participants and to the animals forced into it, animal rights organizations have called for a ban to the sport, resulting in the court banning it several times over the past years. However, with protest from the people against the ban, a new ordinance was made in 2017 to continue the sport.\n\nAncient Tamil Sangams described the practice as (), literally 'bull embracing'. The modern term () or () is derived from ('coins') and ('package'), which refers to a prize of coins that are tied to the bull's horns and that participants attempt to retrieve. () literally means 'bull chasing'.\n\n has been known to be practiced during the Tamil classical period (400-100 BC). It was common among the ancient people Aayars who lived in the ‘Mullai’ geographical division of the ancient Tamil country. Later, it became a platform for display of bravery and prize money was introduced for participation encouragement. A seal from the Indus Valley Civilization depicting the practice is preserved in the National Museum, New Delhi. A cave painting in white kaolin discovered near Madurai depicting a lone man trying to control a bull is estimated to be about 1,500 years old.\n\nSome variants include:\n\nBulls enter the competition area through a gate called the . Typically, participants must only hold onto the bull's hump, and in some variations they are disqualified if they hold onto the bull's neck, horns or tail. There may be several goals to the game depending on region. In some versions, contestants must either hold the bulls hump for 30 seconds or for . If the contestant is thrown by the bull or falls, they lose. Some variations only allow for one contestant. If two people grab the hump, then neither person wins.\n\n\"Bos indicus\" bulls are bred specifically by people of the village for the event. Bulls that are able to participate successfully in the event are used as studs for breeding. These bulls also fetch higher prices in the markets.\n\nWith the introduction of the Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009, by the Tamil Nadu legislature, the following activities were done in preparation of the event:\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, 43 humans and 4 bulls were killed in the events. In 2017, there were 23 deaths in addition to about 2,500 human injuries and several instances of injury to the bulls.\n\nAnimal welfare concerns are related to the handling of the bulls before they are released and also during competitor's attempts to subdue the bull. Practices before the bull is released include prodding the bull with sharp sticks or scythes, extreme bending of the tail which can fracture the vertebrae, and biting of the bull's tail. There are also reports of the bulls being forced to drink alcohol to disorient them, or chilli peppers being rubbed in their eyes to aggravate the bull.\n\nDuring attempts to subdue the bull, they are stabbed by various implements such as knives or sticks, punched, jumped on and dragged to the ground. In variants in which the bull is not enclosed, they may run into traffic or other dangerous places, sometimes resulting in broken bones or death. Protestors claims that is promoted as bull taming, however, others suggest it exploits the bull's natural nervousness as prey animals by deliberately placing them in a terrifying situation in which they are forced to run away from the competitors which they perceive as predators and the practice effectively involves catching a terrified animal. Along with human injuries and fatalities, bulls themselves sometimes sustain injuries or die, which people may interpret as a bad omen for the village.\n\nAn investigation by the Animal Welfare Board of India concluded that \"jallikattu is inherently cruel to animals\".\n\nAnimal welfare organisations such as the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) and PETA India have protested against the practice.\n\nThe Animal Welfare Board of India filed a case in the Supreme Court of India for an outright ban on because of the cruelty to animals and the threat to public safety involved.\n\nOn 27 November 2010, the Supreme Court permitted the Government of Tamil Nadu to allow for five months in a year and directed the District Collectors to make sure that the animals that participate in are registered to the Animal Welfare Board and in return the Board would send its representative to monitor the event. The Government of Tamil Nadu ordered that be deposited by the organizers in case of an accident or injury during the event and enacted a rule to allow a team of veterinarians be present at the venue for certifying the bulls for participation in the event and to provide treatment for bulls that get injured.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification in 2011 that banned the use of bulls as performing animals, thereby banning the event But the practice continued to be held under Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act No 27 of 2009. On 7 May 2014, the Supreme Court of India struck down the state law and banned altogether. The Supreme Court noted that any flouting of the ban should result in penalties for cruelty to animals under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The court also asked the Government of India to amend the law on preventing cruelty to animals to bring bulls within its ambit. The Supreme Court also ruled that cruelty is inherent in these events, as bulls are not anatomically suited for such activities and making them participate is subjecting them to unnecessary pain and suffering, so such events were outlawed.\n\nOn 8 January 2016, the Ministry of Environment and Forests permitted the continuation of the tradition under certain conditions, effectively ending the ban. However, on 14 January 2016, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on this order, upholding the ban, after a petition filed by the Animal Welfare Board of India and PETA India, leading to protests all over Tamil Nadu. The Supreme Court refused to review its decision on 26 July 2016.\n\nOn 16 January 2016, the World Youth Organization (WYO) protested at Chennai against the stay on the order overturning ban on conducting in Tamil Nadu. The WYO also demanded a ban on PETA in India.\n\nOn 8 January 2017, several hundreds of protesters conducted a rally at Chennai Marina opposing the ban on . The participants walked from the lighthouse to the labour statue bearing posters saying \"save \". A few churches openly conducted prayer mass and rally against the Supreme Court ruling. Following the protests at Chennai, many students started rallies in various towns of Tamil Nadu.\n\nAfter hearing the petitions which were led by the Animal Welfare Board of India challenging central government's notification, the Supreme Court of India on 12 January ordered a stay, issued notices to the central government and the government of Tamil Nadu and later refused to lift the stay. Numerous events were held across Tamil Nadu in protest of the ban, and hundreds of participants were detained by police in response. The Supreme Court has agreed to delay its verdict on for a week following the centre's request that doing so would avoid unrest.\n\nDue to these protests, on 21 January 2017, the governor of Tamil Nadu issued a new ordinance that authorized the continuation of events. On 23 January 2017 the Tamil Nadu legislature passed a bipartisan bill, with the accession of the Prime Minister, exempting jallikattu from the Prevention of Cruelity to Animals Act (1960). The first legal jallikattu under this exemption is scheduled on 1 February in Alanganallur, Madurai district.\n\nThe legal situation surrounding is as yet not clearly resolved. Some, such as ex Ministry of External Affairs cabinet minister Salman Khurshid, have stated that the matter will only be truly resolved if the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act is amended as local ordinances and state laws cannot trump Indian federal law. According to \"The Hindu\", many other Indian legal experts agreed with Khurshid's view, as federal laws such as the PCA are always more powerful than state laws, and in that respect the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 is not much different from the state law overturned in 2009. For its part, PETA India has said that it will \"study\" the new ordinance, and has not ruled out a challenge to the new law on the same grounds as it challenged the 2009 law. On Jan 25, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) started the legal process towards another ban by formally challenging the new law before the Supreme Court, but they withdrew the petition on Jan 26. According to the AWBI's acting chairperson, AWBI does not plan to re-file the petition, but he claimed no knowledge of what other organizations, such as PETA, may do.\n\nThe Jallikattu Premier League is a professional league in Tamil Nadu for .

There are instances of the portrayal running as a counter-narrative, wherein a young hero tames an overlord's bull and turns it into a challenge to power and authority.\nIn films such as \"Cheran Pandian\", \"Rajakumaran\", and \"Murattukaalai\", the conflict between the hero and the villain is portrayed through , during which the owner whose bull loses shoots the bull.\nIn \"Mannvasanai\", the heroine's father declares that whoever tames the bull is eligible to marry his daughter, but kills the animal and commits suicide after an outsider from a nearby village tames it and lays claim to his daughter as the prize. \nIn \"Virumaandi\" the hero who returns from Singapore tames the bull, which means that his masculinity and traditional roots are intact, despite going to a foreign land.\nIn \"Thaiku pin Tharam\", is built into the film's climax, and it helps the hero prove he is worthy enough to win the girl.\n\n\n"}

Adhering to neither sartorial nor intellectual fashions, Deck inspired generations of students with his highly idiosyncratic form of idealism, deriving from Plotinus but equally rooted in Thomas Aquinas and Hegel. \n\nHe was educated at Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario, which at that time was affiliated with the University of Western Ontario (B.A., 1946, M.A., 1946). He received his Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Toronto in 1960. His doctoral dissertation reappraised the Neoplatonic philosophy of Plotinus from the standpoint of a central doctrine in his Enneads, exploring how \"contemplative producing\" gives rise to every level of reality, including the physical world; it was published as \"Nature, Contemplation, and the One: A Study in the Philosophy of Plotinus\" by the University of Toronto Press in 1967. \n\nAfter serving as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Boston College and a brief stint working for the Canadian Pacific Railway, in 1957 he became Professor of Philosophy at Assumption College, (later known as the University of Windsor), where he taught graduate and undergraduate courses in metaphysics and the history of philosophy until his death. The University of Windsor awards the John N. Deck Memorial Prize in Philosophy each year \"in recognition of outstanding scholastic achievement or proficiency.\"\n\nAt a time when Neoplatonism in philosophy, as well as philosophy itself in the university, was considered hopelessly outdated, he developed a freshman class called \"Dream worlds and real worlds\" that brought the message of Plotinus to the most unpromising students; it proved to be immensely popular, disconcerting his academic rivals.\n\nAlthough he died in 1979, he is arguably more popular and influential now than ever before. \"Nature, Contemplation, and the One\" was republished in 1991 (back in print for the first time after over twenty years, and in a convenient paperback) and now a proliferation of websites such as Anthony Flood's are making available his articles for ongoing discussion.\n\nR.

{"id": "143884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143884", "title": "Jun Tsuji", "text": "Jun Tsuji\n\n, was a Japanese author: a poet, essayist, playwright, and translator. He has also been described as a Dadaist, nihilist, Epicurean, shakuhachi musician, actor, feminist, and bohemian. He translated Max Stirner's \"The Ego and Its Own\" and Cesare Lombroso's \"The Man of Genius\" into Japanese.\n\nTōkyō-born Tsuji Jun sought escape in literature from a childhood he described as \"nothing but destitution, hardship, and a series of traumatizing difficulties\". He became interested in the works of Tolstoy, Kōtoku Shūsui's socialist anarchism, and the literature of Oscar Wilde and Voltaire, among many others. Later, in 1920 Tsuji was introduced to Dada and became a self-proclaimed first Dadaist of Japan, a title also claimed by Tsuji's contemporary, Shinkichi Takahashi. Tsuji became a fervent proponent of Stirnerite egoist anarchism, which would become a point of contention between himself and Takahashi. He wrote one of the prologues for famed feminist poet Hayashi Fumiko's 1929 ( and was active in the radical artistic circles of his time.\n\nTsuji was influenced by the philosophy of Epicurus, and many characteristics of Epicureanism show through his lifestyle. For example, Tsuji avoided active engagement in politics and sought after a form of ataraxia, which he was apparently able to experience through vagabond wandering and Egoism. He also spent his time primarily trying to enjoy a simple life free of suffering (see Aponia). While his writings themselves are significant, it seems Tsuji's own emphasis was on developing an experimental, liberated lifestyle. Most of Tsuji's writings describe the philosophy behind this, as well as the personal process Tsuji went through towards this aim. As Hagiwara Kyōjirō () wrote, “Tsuji chose not to express himself with a pen so much as he chose to express himself through living, as conveyed by his personality. That is, Tsuji himself was his expression's piece of work”. It is no coincidence that this resembles the Egoist anarchism described by Max Stirner, who seems to be the most influential philosopher in Tsuji's development.\n\nOne notable play written by Tsuji is the dadaist/absurdist , in which a figure must confront Panta Rhei (), or the transient nature of all things. Tsuji saw the concept of Panta Rhei to be related to Stirner's Creative Nothing, wherein it is because of the nihility of all things that there is potential for creativity and change. Tsuji also found this relevant to the Buddhist concept of nothingness, sometimes translated as mu.\n\nIn \"Death of an Epicurean\", Tsuji comments on the destruction of the Ryōunkaku (Cloud-surpassing Tower) in the area of Tokyo he often called home, Asakusa. This building was a skyscraper that had become very much a symbol of modernity in Japan, and its destruction in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake came as a harrowing omen to many who saw it as reminiscent of the Tower of Babel. This symbol would become a popular one in literature, used by such authors as Ishikawa Takuboku.\n\nWritten in the wake of this event, Tsuji's \"Death of an Epicurean\" reads:\nIn this passage Tsuji describes the birth of an Epicurean out of someone who experienced the transience of such eternal-seeming icons as the Ryōunkaku and greater Tokyo. The Epicurean is portrayed here as someone who, in their despair, embraces the Arts in response to tragic ephemerality. For Tsuji, whose residence was reduced by the earthquake to a \"monster right out of Cubism\", this passage comes off as autobiographical, describing his own turn to revelling in Epicureanism and the Arts.\n\nTsuji wrote during the 1920s, a dangerous period in Japanese history for controversial writers, during which he experienced the wages of censorship through police harassment. He also experienced this vicariously through the persecution of close associates such as his former wife, anarcho-feminist Itō Noe, who was murdered in the Amakasu Incident.\n\nFor being a controversial writer in the heart of Tokyo's radical art scene, Tsuji himself believed that had he been living instead as a peasant in the Soviet Union at the time, he would surely have been shot to death. This political climate exacerbated Tsuji's urges towards vagabondage:\n\nIn 1932 Tsuji was institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital after what would become popularly known as the \"Tengu Incident\". According to some accounts, one night during a party at a friend's residence, Tsuji climbed to the second floor and began flapping his arms crying \"I am the Tengu!\", eventually jumping from the building, running around, and jumping onto the table calling \"kyaaaaaa, kyaaaa!!\"\n\nAfter hospitalization, Tsuji was diagnosed as having experienced a temporary psychosis probably resulting from his chronic alcoholism. During this hospitalization Tsuji came to idealize the Buddhist monk Shinran and read the Tannishō many times over. Thereafter the once prolific Tsuji gave up his writing career, and he returned to his custom of vagabondage in the fashion of a Komusō monk, apparently as a sort of Nekkhamma.\n\nFor the next few years Tsuji fell into various incidents with police and was readmitted to mental hospitals several times. At the age of 41 Tsuji suffered a major asthma attack and after hospitalization became weighed down with substantial hospital bills. While book royalties and a sort of provided some economic support, Tsuji was caught up in a harsh late World War II economic environment and spent the last few years of his life in vagabond poverty. Tsuji often made ends meet by going door to door as a busking shakuhachi musician.\n\nHowever, in 1944, Tsuji settled down in a friend's one-bedroom apartment in Tokyo, where he was found dead from starvation.\n\nTsuji is now buried in Tokyo's Saifuku Temple.\n\nTsuji is remembered for having helped found Dadaism in Japan along with contemporaries such as Murayama Tomoyoshi, MAVO, Yoshiyuki Eisuke, and Takahashi Shinkichi. Moreover, he was one of the most prominent Japanese contributors to Nihilist philosophy prior to World War II. He is also remembered as the father of prominent Japanese painter, Makoto Tsuji ().\n\nTsuji was depicted in the 1969 film \"Eros + Massacre\" and has been the subject of several Japanese books and articles. Tsuji's friend and contemporary anarchist, Hagiwara Kyōjirō, described Tsuji as follows: \n\nThis person, \"Tsuji Jun\", is the most interesting figure in Japan today ... He is like a commandment-breaking monk, like Christ ...\n\nVagrants and labourers of the town gather about him. The defeated unemployed and the penniless find in him their own home and religion ... his disciples are the hungry and the poor of the world. Surrounded by these disciples he passionately preaches the Good News of Nihilism. But he is not Christlike, and he preaches but drunken nonsense. Then the disciples call him merely \"Tsuji\" without respect and sometimes hit him on the head. This is a strange religion ...\n<br><br>\nBut here Tsuji has regrettably been portrayed as a religious character. It sounds contradictory, but Tsuji is a religious man without a religion ... As art is not a religion, neither is Tsuji's life religious. But in a sense it is ... Tsuji calls himself an \"Unmensch\" ... If Nietzsche's Zarathustra is religious ... then Tsuji's teaching would be a better religion than Nietzsche's, for Tsuji lives in accord with his principles as himself ... \n<br><br>\nTsuji is a sacrifice of modern culture... In the Japanese literary world Tsuji can be considered a rebel. But this is not because he is a drunkard, nor because he lacks manners, nor because he is an anarchist. It is because he puts forth his dirty ironies as boldly as a bandit ... Tsuji himself is very shy and timid in person ... but his clarity and self-respect exposes the falsities of the famous in the literary world ... [though] to many he really comes across as an anarchistic rogue ...\n\nThe literary world only sees him as having been born in this world to provide a source for gossip, but he is like Chaplin producing seeds of humour in their rumours ... The common Japanese literati do not understand that the laugh of Chaplin is a contradictory tragedy ... In a society of base, closed-minded people idealists are always taken as madmen or clowns.\n<br><br>\nTsuji Jun is always drunk. If he doesn't drink he can't stand the suffering and sorrow of life. On the rare occasion he is sober ... he does look the part of an incompetent and \"Unmensch\"-ian fool. Then his faithful disciples bring him saké in place of a ceremonial offering, pour electricity back into his robot heart, and wait for him to start moving... In this way the teaching of the \"Unmensch begins\". It is a religion for the weak, the proletariat, the egoists, and those of broken personalities, and at the same time – it is a most pure, a most sorrowful religion for modern intellectuals.\n\n"}

A second grave can be found at Tōkei-ji Temple in Kamakura, where his friend D. T. Suzuki organized Nishida's funeral and was later also buried in the adjacent plot. Nishida's third grave is at Reiun'in (霊雲院, \"Reiun'in\"), a temple in the Myōshin-ji compound in Kyoto.\n\nBeing born in the third year of the Meiji period, Nishida was presented with a new, unique opportunity to contemplate Eastern philosophical issues in the fresh light that Western philosophy shone on them. Nishida's original and creative philosophy, incorporating ideas of Zen and Western philosophy, was aimed at bringing the East and West closer. Throughout his lifetime, Nishida published a number of books and essays including \"An Inquiry into the Good\" and \"The Logic of the Place of Nothingness and the Religious Worldview.\" Taken as a whole, Nishida’s life work was the foundation for the Kyoto School of philosophy and the inspiration for the original thinking of his disciples.\n\nThe most famous concept in Nishida's philosophy is the logic of basho (Japanese: 場所; usually translated as \"place\" or \"topos\"), a non-dualistic concrete logic, meant to overcome the inadequacy of the subject–object distinction essential to the subject logic of Aristotle and the predicate logic of Immanuel Kant, through the affirmation of what he calls the \"absolutely contradictory self-identity\", a dynamic tension of opposites that, unlike the dialectical logic of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, does not resolve in a synthesis. Rather, it defines its proper subject by maintaining the tension between affirmation and negation as opposite poles or perspectives.\n\nWhen David A. Dilworth wrote about Nishida’s work, he did not mention the debut book in his useful classification. In his book \"Zen no kenkyū\" (An Inquiry into the Good), Nishida writes about experience, reality, good and religion. He argues that the most profound form of experience is the pure experience. Nishida analyzes the thought, the will, the intellectual intuition and the pure experience among them. According to Nishida’s vision as well as to the essence of Asian wisdom, one craves harmony in experience, for unity.\n\nAccording to Masao Abe, \"During World War II right wing thinkers attacked him as antinationalistic for his appreciation of Western philosophy and logic. But after the war left wing thinkers criticized his philosophy as nationalistic because of his emphasis on the traditional notion of \"nothingness\". He recognized a kind of universality in Western philosophy and logic but did not accept that it was the only universality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, unlike Book Pahlavi script, which is a later but more common form of the consonantary and has 12 or 13 graphemes, the script of the psalms has 5 symbols more. The variant of the script used for the psalter was for almost a century the only evidence of that specific variant, which consequently came to be referred to as Psalter Pahlavi script. More recently however, another sample of the writing was discovered in the inscriptions on a bronze processional cross found at Herat (in present-day Afghanistan). Due to the dearth of comparable material, some words and phrases in both sources remain undeciphered.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "78238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78238", "title": "Pensées", "text": "Pensées\n\nThe Pensées (\"Thoughts\") is a collection of fragments on theology and philosophy written by 17th-century philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal's religious conversion led him into a life of asceticism, and the \"Pensées\" was in many ways his life's work. The \"Pensées\" represented Pascal's defense of the Christian religion. The concept of \"Pascal's Wager\" stems from a portion of this work.\n\nThe \"Pensées\" is the name given posthumously to fragments that Pascal had been preparing for an apology for Christianity, which was never completed. That envisioned work is often referred to as the \"Apology for the Christian Religion\", although Pascal never used that title.\n\nAlthough the \"Pensées\" appears to consist of ideas and jottings, some of which are incomplete, it is believed that Pascal had, prior to his death in 1662, already planned out the order of the book and had begun the task of cutting and pasting his draft notes into a coherent form. His task incomplete, subsequent editors have disagreed on the order, if any, in which his writings should be read. Those responsible for his effects, failing to recognize the basic structure of the work, handed them over to be edited, and they were published in 1670. The first English translation was made in 1688 by John Walker. Another English translation by W. F. Trotter was published in 1958. The proper order of the \"Pensées\" is heavily disputed.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to arrange the notes systematically; notable editions include those of Léon Brunschvicg, Jacques Chevalier, Louis Lafuma and (more recently) Philippe Sellier. Although Brunschvicg tried to classify the posthumous fragments according to themes, recent research has prompted Sellier to choose entirely different classifications, as Pascal often examined the same event or example through many different lenses. Also noteworthy is the monumental edition of Pascal's \"Œuvres complètes\" (1964–1992), which is known as the Tercentenary Edition and was realized by Jean Mesnard; although still incomplete, this edition reviews the dating, history and critical bibliography of each of Pascal's texts.\n\n"}

With King Gesar and Avalokiteśvara, of whom he is an incarnation, he is one of the most important figures in Tibetan culture. \"Pha\" means \"father\", \"Trelgen\" \"old monkey\" and \"Changchup Sempa\" refers to the bodhisattva (\"Changchub\" meaning \"enlightenment\" and \"Sempa\" meaning \"intention\").\n\nA very popular Tibetan creation myth holds that in the beginning the world was covered by water, which evaporated little by little, leaving room for animal life. To the flooded land of Tibet came a monkey that had withdrawn there to immerse himself in meditation and to follow a life of asceticism and chastity. He settled on Mount Gongori. One day, while he sat in meditation, a female demon came to seduce him. Tradition has it that she was the manifestation of the bodhisattva Tara (\"Jetsun Dolma\" in Tibetan), a symbol of compassion and protector of merchants and travelers. She threatened that if he refused to sleep with her she would visit a demon and conceive a multitude of small monsters that would destroy all living creatures. The wise monkey yielded and requested Avalokiteśvara's authorization to marry her. Avalokiteśvara blessed the monkey and the female demon, and a few months later six small monkeys were born of their union. The monkey let his six children grow up in the forest, but three years later he discovered that they had become five hundred. The fruits of the forest were no longer sufficient to feed them, and the five hundred monkeys beseeched their father to help them find food. Not knowing what to do, he went again to ask help from the god of compassion. Then Avalokiteśvara went on the mount Meru, or Sumeru (believed to correspond to today's Mount Kailash), a sacred place for Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and Bönpo. Some say that at the top of the mountain he gathered a handful of barley, others that he extracted five cereals from his own body to offer to the monkey father. Then the monkey father learned agriculture and, after a good harvest, could finally feed all his children. As they fed on the cereals, the monkeys gradually lost their hair and their tails. They also started to use bone and stone implements, then made clothes and built houses, forming a civilization from which the Tibetan people descended.\n\nAnother account says that, seeing the world peopled by demons, Avalokiteśvara the bodhisattva of compassion took pity on the Earth, incarnated himself as a monkey and mated with an ogress of the rock. From this union were born six monkeys, which represent the six principal clans of the Tibetan people.\n\nSEGARRA André, \"Du Singe au Signe ou la figure du Trickster à travers les deux principaux personages du Rāmāyaṇa et du Xīyóu jì : Hanuman et Sun Wukong\", mémoire de littérature sous la direction de Valérie Deshoulières, Université Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, 2007.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "258693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=258693", "title": "Richard Swinburne", "text": "Richard Swinburne\n\nRichard G. Swinburne (; born 26 December 1934) is a British philosopher. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. Over the last 50 years Swinburne has been an influential proponent of philosophical arguments for the existence of God. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of \"The Coherence of Theism\", \"The Existence of God\", and \"Faith and Reason\".\n\nSwinburne received an Open Scholarship to study classics at Exeter College, Oxford, but in fact graduated with a first class BA in philosophy, politics, and economics. \nSwinburne has held various professorships through his career in academia. From 1972 to 1985 he taught at Keele University. During part of this time, he gave the Gifford lectures at Aberdeen from 1982 to 1984, resulting in the book \"The Evolution of the Soul\". From 1985 until his retirement in 2002 he was Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion at the University of Oxford (his successor in this chair is Brian Leftow). He has continued to publish regularly since his retirement.\n\nSwinburne has been an active author throughout his career, producing a major book every two to three years. He has played an important role in recent debate over the mind-body problem, defending a substance dualism that recalls the work of René Descartes in important respects. See \"The Evolution of the Soul\", 1997.\n\nHis books are primarily very technical works of academic philosophy, but he has written at the popular level as well. Of the non-technical works, his \"Is There a God?\" (1996), summarising for a non-specialist audience many of his arguments for the existence of God and plausibility in the belief of that existence, is probably the most popular, and is available in 22 languages.\n\nA member of the Orthodox Church, he is noted as one of the foremost Christian apologists, arguing in his many articles and books that faith in Christianity is rational and coherent in a rigorous philosophical sense. William Hasker writes that his \"tetralogy on Christian doctrine, together with his earlier trilogy on the philosophy of theism, is one of the most important apologetic projects of recent times.\" While Swinburne presents many arguments to advance the belief that God exists, he argues that God is a being whose existence is not logically necessary (see modal logic), but metaphysically necessary in a way he defines in his \"The Christian God\". Other subjects on which Swinburne writes include personal identity (in which he espouses a view based on the concept of a soul), and epistemic justification. He has written in defence of Cartesian dualism and libertarian free will.\n\nAlthough he is best known for his vigorous rational defence of Christian intellectual commitments, he also has a theory of the nature of passionate faith which is developed in his book \"Faith and Reason\".\n\nAccording to an interview Swinburne did with \"Foma\" magazine, he converted from Anglicanism (Church of England) to Eastern Orthodoxy around 1996:\n\nSwinburne's philosophical method reflects the influence of Thomas Aquinas. He admits that he draws from Aquinas a systematic approach to philosophical theology. Swinburne, like Aquinas, moves from basic philosophical issues (for example, the question of the possibility that God may exist in Swinburne's \"The Coherence of Theism\"), to more specific Christian beliefs (for example, the claim in Swinburne's \"Revelation\" that God has communicated to human beings propositionally in Jesus Christ).\n\nSwinburne moves in his writing program from the philosophical to the theological, building his case rigorously, and relying on his previous arguments as he defends particular Christian beliefs. He has attempted to reassert classical Christian beliefs with an apologetic method that he believes is compatible with contemporary science. That method relies heavily on inductive logic, seeking to show that his Christian beliefs fit best with the evidence.\n\nNational Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/15) with Richard Swinburne in 2015 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After embracing Communism in his youth, Hook was later known for his criticisms of totalitarianism, both fascism and Marxism–Leninism. A pragmatic social democrat, Hook sometimes cooperated with conservatives, particularly in opposing Communism. After World War II, he argued that members of such groups as the Communist Party USA and Leninists like Democratic centralists could ethically be barred from holding the offices of public trust because they called for the violent overthrow of democratic governments.\n\nSidney Hook was born on December 20, 1902, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Jennie and Isaac Hook, Austrian Jewish immigrants. He became a supporter of the Socialist Party during the Debs era when he was in high school. \n\nIn 1923, he earned a BA at the City College of New York and in 1927 Ph.D. at Columbia University, where he studied under pragmatist philosopher John Dewey. \n\nIn 1926, Hook became a professor of philosophy at New York University and, from 1948 to 1969, was head of the Department of Philosophy. He retired from the University in 1972.\nIn 1931, Hook began teaching at the New School for Social Research through 1936, after which he taught night school there until the 1960s. By 1933, Hook and New School colleague Horace M. Kallen were serving also on the ACLU's academic freedom committee.\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Hook was a prominent expert on Karl Marx's philosophy and was himself a Marxist. He attended the lectures of Karl Korsch in Berlin in 1928 and conducted research at the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow in the summer of 1929. At first, he wrote enthusiastically about the Soviet Union, and, in 1932, supported the Communist Party's candidate, William Z. Foster, when he ran for President of the United States. However, Hook broke completely with the Comintern in 1933, holding its policies responsible for the triumph of Nazism in Germany. He accused Joseph Stalin of putting \"the needs of the Russian state\" over the needs of the international revolution.\n\nHowever, Hook remained active in some of the causes of the far Left during the Great Depression. In 1933, with James Burnham, Hook was one of the organizers of the American Workers Party, led by the Dutch-born pacifist minister A.J. Muste. Hook also debated the meaning of Marxism with radical Max Eastman in a series of public exchanges. Eastman, like Hook, had studied under John Dewey at Columbia University. In the late 1930s, Hook assisted Leon Trotsky in his efforts to clear his name in a special Commission of Inquiry headed by Dewey, which investigated Stalinist charges made against Trotsky during the Moscow Trials.\n\nThe Great Purge encouraged Hook's increasing ambivalence toward Marxism. In 1939, Hook formed the Committee for Cultural Freedom, a short-lived organization that set the stage for his postwar politics by opposing \"totalitarianism\" on the left and right. By the Cold War, Hook had become a prominent anti-Communist, although he continued to consider himself both a democratic socialist and a secular humanist throughout his life. He was, therefore, an anti-Communist socialist. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hook helped found Americans for Intellectual Freedom, the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), and the American Committee for Cultural Freedom. These bodies—of which the CCF was most central—were funded in part by the Central Intelligence Agency through a variety of fronts and sought to dissuade American leftists from continuing to advocate cooperation with the Soviet Union as some had previously. Hook later wrote in his memoirs that he, \"like almost everyone else,\" had heard that \"the CIA was making some contribution to the financing of the Congress.\"\n\nOn February 6, 1953, Hook discussed \"The Threat to Academic Freedom\" with Victor Riesel and others in the evening on WEVD radio (a Socialist radio station whose call letters referred to SPA founder Eugene V. Debs). In May 1953, the John Day Company published \"Heresy, Yes–Conspiracy, No\", a 283-page book expanded from a 1952 pamphlet (\"Heresy, Yes–Conspiracy, No!\"), itself expanded from a 1950 \"New York Times\" article called \"Heresy, Yes–But Conspiracy, No.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Hook was a frequent critic of the New Left. He was opposed to a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Vietnam War and defended California Governor Ronald Reagan's removal of Angela Davis from her professorship at UCLA because of her leadership role in the Communist Party USA.\n\nHook was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965 and ended his career in the 1970s and 1980s as a fellow of the conservative Hoover Institution in Stanford, California.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities selected Hook for the 1984 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. Hook's lecture was entitled \"Education in Defense of a Free Society.\"\n\nHook was a lifelong agnostic.\n\nHe married Carrie Katz in 1924, with whom he had one son. The couple separated in 1933. Katz had studied at the Rand School in the early 1920s. There, she studied under Scott Nearing and came to write a chapter in his book \"The Law of Social Revolution\" entitled \"The Russian Revolution of 1917\" (1926). Friends from the Rand School included Nerma Berman Oggins, wife of Cy Oggins. She was a Communist Party member who was a \"Fosterite\" (i.e., she supported William Z. Foster amidst Party factionalism in the last 1920s). She went on to work at the Labor Defense Council. In 1935, Hook married Ann Zinken, with whom he had two children.\n\nHook died age 86 on July 12, 1989, in Stanford, California.\n\n\nHook's memoir, \"Out of Step\", recounts his life, his activism for a number of educational causes, his controversies with other intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky, and his recollections of Mortimer J. Adler, Bertolt Brecht, Morris Cohen, John Dewey, Max Eastman, Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell.\n\nIn October 2002, a conference marking the centennial of Hook's birth was organized by Matthew Cotter and Robert Talisse and held at the City University of New York Graduate Center in Manhattan.\n\nIn April 2011 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) (formerly known as CSICOP) again honored Hook. At a meeting of its executive council in Denver, Colorado he was selected for inclusion in their Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.\n\nSidney Hook's book \"The Hero in History\" was a noticeable event in the studies devoted to the role of the hero, the Great Man in history and the influence of people of significant accomplishments.\n\nHook opposed all forms of determinism and argued, as had William James, that humans play a creative role in constructing the social world and to transforming their natural environment. Neither humanity nor its universe is determined or finished. For Hook this conviction was crucial. He argued that when a society is at the crossroads of choosing the direction of further development, an individual can play a dramatic role and even become an independent power on whom the choice of the historical pathway depends.\n\nIn his book, Hook provided a great number of examples of the influence of great people, and the examples are mostly associated with various crucial moments in history, such as revolutions and crises. Some scholars have critically responded because, as one of them claims, he does not take into account that an individual's greatest influence can be revealed not so much in the period of the old regime's collapse, but in the formation period of a new one... Besides, he did not make clear the situation when alternatives appear either as the result of a crisis or as the result of Great Man's plan or intention without [a] manifested crisis. \n\nHook introduced a theoretical division of historic personalities and especially leaders into the eventful man and the event-making man, depending on their influences on the historical process. For example, he considers Lenin as having been an event-making man, because of his having acted in an important circumstance to change the developmental direction not only of Russia but also of the whole world in the 20th century.\n\nHook attached great importance to accidents and contingencies in history, thus opposing, among others, Herbert Fisher, who made attempts to present history as \"waves\" of emergencies.\n\nIn 1954, Hook published an essay titled \"The Ethics of Controversy,\" in which he set down ten ground rules for democratic discourse within a democracy.\n\n\n\nHook's papers at Stanford include the following articles:\n\n\n\n\n"}

She also writes and maintains the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article \"The Contents of Perception.\" Her monograph was well received, and her papers have been widely cited. Siegel has been photographed by the American Photographer Steve Pyke and she appears on the cover of Steven Pyke's photographic anthology of important contemporary philosophers\n\nNed Block described Siegel's \"The Contents of Visual Experience\" as \"one of the most significant books in philosophy of mind for many years.\" James Genone hailed \"The Contents of Visual Experience\" as \"an important contribution to the contemporary literature on the nature and structure of perception,\" and lauded Siegel for being one of the first recent philosophers to challenge the prevailing view that perceptual experiences have representational contents, suggesting that if Siegel is correct in her views, the result would be a sea change that would effect not only the philosophy of perceptual experiences, but also have broad implications for many other areas of philosophy.\n\nThe early portion of Siegel's book constructs and contrasts two opposing views, one that she deems the \"Content View,\" and one that she describes as the \"Rich Content View.\" The \"Content View\" represents a situation in which there is precision in the way in which perceptual experiences have meaningful contents, whereas in the \"Rich Content View\" perceptual experiences consist of simple and complex properties that humans extrapolate meaning from. Having established this framework, Siegel uses it to examine three major philosophical points: first, that humans are able to determine content from sensory cues (in what Siegel describes as 'the method of phenomenal contrast,\") second, that the method of phenomenal contrast supports the idea of the Rich Content model as an enhancement over the Content model, and lastly that while ordinary visual experiences involve seeing things that pertain to objects in addition to seeing things that do not pertain to objects, hallucinations differ from standard visual experiences by only perceiving things that do not pertain to particular objects.\n\nIn a series of peer reviewed articles, and a monograph titled \"The Rationality of Perception\" (2017), Siegel argues that we can epistemically evaluate the subpersonal transitions that lead to a perceptual experience, just as we rationally evaluate the transitions that lead to an individual forming a belief. So called \"ill-founded\" influences or transitions can diminish the epistemic value of the resulting experience. This upturns the traditional philosophical emphasis on perceptual experience as epistemically foundational, capable of justifying beliefs without itself being susceptible to epistemic evaluation in terms of rationality.\n\n"}

After graduation, he became a philosopher and published a series of scholarly articles.\n\nAs his interests began to shift from philosophy to theology, Baljian studied Armenian Apostolic Theology and Divinity in Athens, Greece. He eventually gained the title of \"vardapet\", an ecclesiastical rank for learned preachers and teachers in the Armenian Apostolic Church roughly equivalent to receiving a doctorate in theology. In the 1940s, he became a bishop, and then the \"arajnord\" (leader) of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Romania.\n\nHis rise through the hierarchy of the Church culminated in 1955 when, on September 30th 1955, he was elected Catholicos of All Armenians, becoming one of the youngest Catholicoi in the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He reigned until his death in 1994. During his long time as Catholicos, he managed to assert some independence for his church in face of the totalitarian Soviet rule in the Armenian SSR, and lived to see religious freedom restored under Armenia's national government in 1991.\n\nFrom then on, he was busy renewing ancient Armenian churches and reviving institutions of the church. He saved a number of church treasures by establishing the Alex Manoogian Museum of the Mother Church. Vazgen intensified contacts with the Armenian Catholic Church, with the aim of reuniting both wings of Armenian Christianity.\nHe died on August 18, 1994, after suffering from a long-illness.\n"}

In addition, the Methodist church teaches that the works of mercy are a means of grace which lead to holiness and aid in sanctification.\n\nThe works of mercy have been traditionally divided into two categories, each with seven elements: \n\nPope John Paul II issued a papal encyclical \"Dives in misericordia\" on 30 November 1980 declaring that \"Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called 'to practice mercy' towards others.\" Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the Divine Mercy, which derives from apparitions of Jesus Christ to Saint Faustina Kowalska.\n\nBased on Jesus' doctrine of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds and their omission is a reason for damnation. Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy, and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming and believes Jesus obeyed every mitzvah and fulfilled the Scriptures, Catholics perform the works of mercy.\n\nIn particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally. In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, Pope Francis suggested \"care for creation\" as a new work of mercy, describing it as a \"complement\" to the existing works. Francis characterized this new work as having both corporal and spiritual components. Corporally, it involves \"daily gestures which break with the logic of violence, exploitation and selfishness\". Spiritually, it involves contemplating each part of creation to find what God is teaching us through them. This pronouncement extensively quoted the encyclical \"Laudato si'\", and Cardinal Peter Turkson, who helped write the encyclical, clarified that the addition of this work of mercy was part of Francis' intention for \"Laudato si\"'.\n\nCorporal works of mercy are those that tend to the bodily needs of other creatures. They come from Isaiah 58 and the mitzvah of hospitality. The seventh work of mercy comes from the Book of Tobit and from the mitzvah of burial, although it was not added to the list until the Middle Ages.\n\nThe works include:\n\nJust as the corporal works of mercy are directed towards relieving corporeal suffering, the aim of the spiritual works of mercy is to relieve spiritual suffering. The first four come from Ezekiel 33, the fifth comes from the mitzvah of forgiving others before receiving forgiveness from God, the sixth comes from Deuteronomy 15, and the seventh comes from Maccabees 2.\n\nThe works include:\n\nThe Corporal works of mercy are an important subject of Christian iconography. In some representations of the Middle Ages, the seven works were allegorically juxtaposed with the seven deadly sins (avarice, anger, envy, laziness, unchastity, intemperance, pride). The pictorial representation of the works of mercy began in the 12th century.\n\nThe Master of Alkmaar painted the polyptych of the \"Seven works of mercy\" (ca. 1504) for the Church of Saint Lawrence in Alkmaar, Netherlands. His series of wooden panel paintings show the works of mercy, with Jesus in the background viewing each, in this order: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and ransom the captive.\n\nThe painting of the \"Seven Works of Mercy\" by Frans II Francken (1605) represents the acts not as a picture cycle, but in one single composition.\n\nA major work of the iconography of mercy is the altarpiece of Caravaggio (1606/07) in Naples, which was commissioned by the Confraternità del Pio Monte della Misericordia for their church. This charity brotherhood was founded in 1601 in Naples. The artist painted the \"Seven Works of Mercy\" in one single composition. Regarding the sharp contrasts of the painting’s chiaroscuro, the art historian Ralf van Bühren explains the bright light as a metaphor for mercy, which \"helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives\".\n\nIn Methodist teaching, doing merciful acts is a prudential means of grace. Along with works of piety, they are necessary for the believer to move on to Christian perfection. In this sense, the Methodist concern for people at the margins is closely related to its worship. As such, these beliefs have helped create the emphasis of the social gospel in the Methodist Church.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36971621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36971621", "title": "Yoga for children", "text": "Yoga for children\n\nYoga for children is a form of yoga that is designed specifically for children. It includes poses to increase strength, flexibility, and coordination. Classes are intended to be fun and may include age-appropriate games, animal sounds and creative names for poses.\n\nYoga for children is also used in classrooms and educational settings. There are many benefits of a regular yoga practice for students, but there are also benefits for the classroom teachers as well. Karen Fabian of MindBodyGreen.com pointed out that \"In a school setting, yoga can also benefit teachers by: Giving them an alternate way to handle challenges in the classroom, Giving them a healthy activity to integrate with lesson plans, Give them a way to blend exercise into their classes\".\n\nThe program is designed for children of all ages. Yoga for small children incorporates fun poses, games and songs. For older children the program becomes more active and new poses and games are introduced and breathing techniques are taught. This helps the children integrate new skills of self-regulation and calmness into their lives.\n\nThe benefits for children are similar to those for adults. Emotional benefits include greater optimism and a less reactive nature. Mental benefits including increased focus, concentration and improvements in the quality of sleep have been reported.\n\nAcademic performance has been noted to improve along with confidence in physical abilities. Yoga is used for the treatment of children with special needs, and to aid conventional medical treatment.\n\nResearch suggests that yoga practice can protect boys from increases in negative behavior.\n\nPhysical benefits include increased flexibility, improved coordination and balance, and increased core and body strength. Mental benefits include stronger mind-body connection, increased self-esteem, better focus and concentration, and increased ability to relax and cope with stressful situations. Social/emotional benefits include more awareness of self and those around you and increased problem-solving and conflict-resolution strategies.\n\nAlthough yoga has many health benefits, some criticize the use of yoga in the classroom. The main criticism is that yoga has religious associations that concern some parents. Visi Tilak of Parents.com shared the following common concerns in 2013: \"Although many adults like the benefits of yoga, some parents feel that the practice might have a religious association and, like prayer, shouldn't be allowed in a public space. They argue that yoga is an offshoot of Hinduism and that it disseminates religious and meditation principles with its use of \"Om\" and \"Namaste\" chanting. Some also believe that the asanas, or postures, such as the sun salutation, are a form of Hindu religious worship\".\n\nSince the benefits of using yoga in the classroom are great, many teachers avoid using the traditional Sanskrit pose names to avoid the religious association. Instead, they use generic terms that describe what one's body is doing (such as cat, cow, tree, table, and bridge).\n"}
{"id": "164632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164632", "title": "Zazen", "text": "Zazen\n\nZazen (literally \"seated meditation\"; ; , ) is a meditative discipline that is typically the primary practice of the Zen Buddhist tradition. The precise meaning and method of zazen varies from school to school, but in general it can be regarded as a means of insight into the nature of existence. In the Japanese Rinzai school, zazen is usually associated with the study of koans. The Sōtō School of Japan, on the other hand, only rarely incorporates koans into zazen, preferring an approach where the mind has no object at all, known as shikantaza.\n\nZazen is considered the heart of Japanese Sōtō Zen Buddhist practice. The aim of zazen is just sitting, that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.\n\nIn Zen temples and monasteries, practitioners traditionally sit zazen as a group in a meditation hall, usually referred to as the \"zendo\". The practitioner sits on a cushion called a \"zafu\", which itself is usually placed on top of a low, flat mat called a \"zabuton\".\n\nBefore taking one's seat, and after rising at the end of the period of zazen, a Zen practitioner performs a \"gassho\" bow to their seat, and a second bow to fellow practitioners.\n\nThe beginning of a period of zazen is traditionally announced by ringing a bell three times (\"shijosho\"), and the end of a round by ringing the bell either once or twice (\"hozensho\").\n\nLong periods of zazen may alternate with periods of kinhin (walking meditation).\n\nThe posture of zazen is seated, with folded legs and hands, and an erect but settled spine. The hands are folded together into a simple mudra over the belly. In many practices, the practitioner breathes from the \"hara\" (the center of gravity in the belly) and the eyelids are half-lowered, the eyes being neither fully open nor shut so that the practitioner is neither distracted by, nor turning away from, external stimuli.\n\nThe legs are folded in one of the standard sitting styles:\n\n\nIn addition, it is not uncommon for modern practitioners to practice zazen in a chair, often with a wedge or cushion on top of it so that one is sitting on an incline, or by placing a wedge behind the lower back to help maintain the natural curve of the spine. One can sit comfortably, but not too comfortably, so as to avoid falling asleep. While each of these styles is commonly taught today, Master Dogen recommended only \"Kekkafuza\" and \"Hankafuza\".\n\nIn his book \"Three Pillars of Zen\", Philip Kapleau says that practitioners in the Rinzai school face in, towards each other with their backs to the wall, and in the Sōtō school, practitioners face the wall or a curtain. Kapleau quotes Hakuun Yasutani's lectures for beginners. In lecture four, Yasutani describes the five kinds of zazen: \"bompu\", \"gedo\", \"shojo\", \"daijo\", and \"saijojo\" (he adds the latter is the same thing as shikantaza).\n\nVery generally speaking, zazen practice is taught in one of three ways.\n\nKoan practice is usually associated with the Rinzai school and Shikantaza with the Sōtō school. In reality many Zen communities use both methods depending on the teacher and students.\n\nThe initial stages of training in zazen resemble traditional Buddhist samatha meditation in actual practice, and emphasize the development of the power of concentration, or \"joriki\" (定力) (Sanskrit \"\"). The student begins by focusing on the breath at the \"hara/tanden\" with mindfulness of breath (\"ānāpānasmṛti\") exercises such as counting breath (\"sūsokukan\" 数息観) or just watching it (\"zuisokukan\" 随息観). Mantras are also sometimes used in place of counting. Practice is typically to be continued in one of these ways until there is adequate \"one-pointedness\" of mind to constitute an initial experience of \"samadhi\". At this point, the practitioner moves to one of the other two methods of zazen.\n\nHaving developed awareness, the practitioner can now focus his or her consciousness on a koan as an object of meditation. Since koans are, ostensibly, not solvable by intellectual reasoning, koan introspection is designed to shortcut the intellectual process leading to direct realization of a reality beyond thought.\n\nShikantaza is a form of meditation, in which the practitioner does not use any specific object of meditation; rather, practitioners remain as much as possible in the present moment, aware of and observing what passes through their minds and around them. Dogen says, in his \"Shobogenzo\", \"Sitting fixedly, think of not thinking. How do you think of not thinking? Nonthinking. This is the art of zazen.\"\n\n\n\n"}
