{"id": "1100734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1100734", "title": "Absolute idealism", "text": "Absolute idealism\n\nAbsolute idealism is an ontologically monistic philosophy \"chiefly associated with Friedrich Schelling and G. W. F. Hegel, both German idealist philosophers of the 19th century, Josiah Royce, an American philosopher, and others, but, in its essentials, the product of Hegel\". It is Hegel's account of how being is ultimately comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole (\"das Absolute\"). Hegel asserted that in order for the thinking subject (human reason or consciousness) to be able to know its object (the world) at all, there must be in some sense an identity of thought and being. Otherwise, the subject would never have access to the object and we would have no certainty about any of our knowledge of the world. To account for the differences between thought and being, however, as well as the richness and diversity of each, the unity of thought and being cannot be expressed as the abstract identity \"A=A\". Absolute idealism is the attempt to demonstrate this unity using a new \"speculative\" philosophical method, which requires new concepts and rules of logic. According to Hegel, the absolute ground of being is essentially a dynamic, historical process of necessity that unfolds by itself in the form of increasingly complex forms of being and of consciousness, ultimately giving rise to all the diversity in the world and in the concepts with which we think and make sense of the world.\n\nThe absolute idealist position dominated philosophy in nineteenth-century England and Germany, while exerting significantly less influence in the United States. The absolute idealist position should be distinguished from the subjective idealism of Berkeley, the transcendental idealism of Kant, or the post-Kantian transcendental idealism (also known as critical idealism) of Fichte and of the early Schelling.\n\nFor Hegel, the interaction of opposites generates in dialectical fashion all concepts we use in order to understand the world. Moreover, this development occurs not only in the individual mind, but also through history. In \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\", for example, Hegel presents a history of human consciousness as a journey through stages of explanations of the world. Each successive explanation created problems and oppositions within itself, leading to tensions which could only be overcome by adopting a view that could accommodate these oppositions in a higher unity. At the base of spirit lies a rational development. This means that the absolute itself is exactly that rational development. The assertion that \"All reality is spirit\" means that all of reality rationally orders itself and while doing so creates the oppositions we find in it. Even nature is not different from the spirit since it itself is ordered by the determinations given to us by spirit. Nature, as that which is not spirit is so determined by spirit, therefore it follows that nature is not absolutely other, but understood as other and therefore not essentially alien. \n\nThe aim of Hegel was to show that we do not relate to the world as if it is other from us, but that we continue to find ourselves back into that world. With the realisation that both the mind and the world are ordered according to the same rational principles, our access to the world has been made secure, a security which was lost after Kant proclaimed the 'Ding an sich' to be ultimately inaccessible.\n\nNeo-Hegelianism is a school (or schools) of thought associated and inspired by the works of Hegel.\n\nIt refers mainly to the doctrines of an idealist school of philosophers that were prominent in Great Britain and in the United States between 1870 and 1920. The name is also sometimes applied to cover other philosophies of the period that were Hegelian in inspiration—for instance, those of Benedetto Croce and of Giovanni Gentile.\n\nAlthough Hegel died in 1831, his philosophy lived on. In politics, there was a developing schism, even before his death, between right Hegelians and left Hegelians.\n\nIn the philosophy of religion, Hegel's influence soon became very powerful in the English-speaking world. The British school, called British idealism and partly Hegelian in inspiration, included Thomas Hill Green, Bernard Bosanquet, F.H. Bradley, William Wallace, and Edward Caird. It was importantly directed towards political philosophy and political and social policy, but also towards metaphysics and logic, as well as aesthetics.\n\nAmerica saw the development of a school of Hegelian thought move toward pragmatism.\n\nIn Germany there was a neo-Hegelianism (\"Neuhegelianismus\") of the early twentieth century, partly developing out of the Neo-Kantians. Richard Kroner wrote one of its leading works, a history of German idealism from a Hegelian point of view.\n\n\nExponents of analytic philosophy, which has been the dominant form of Anglo-American philosophy for most of the last century, have criticised Hegel's work as hopelessly obscure. Existentialists also criticise Hegel for ultimately choosing an essentialistic whole over the particularity of existence. Epistemologically, one of the main problems plaguing Hegel's system is how these thought determinations have bearing on reality as such. A perennial problem of his metaphysics seems to be the question of how spirit externalises itself and how the concepts it generates can say anything true about nature. At the same time, they will have to, because otherwise Hegel's system concepts would say nothing about something that is not itself a concept and the system would come down to being only an intricate game involving vacuous concepts.\n\nSchopenhauer noted that Hegel created his absolute idealism after Kant had discredited all proofs of God's existence. The Absolute is a non-personal substitute for the concept of God. It is the one subject that perceives the universe as one object. Individuals share in parts of this perception. Since the universe exists as an idea in the mind of the Absolute, absolute idealism copies Spinoza's pantheism in which everything is in God or Nature.\n\nFamously, G. E. Moore’s rebellion against absolutism found expression in his defense of common sense against the radically counter-intuitive conclusions of absolutism (e.g. time is unreal, change is unreal, separateness is unreal, imperfection is unreal, etc.). G. E. Moore also pioneered the use of logical analysis against the absolutists, which Bertrand Russell promulgated and began the entire tradition of analytic philosophy with its use against the philosophies of his direct predecessors. In recounting his own mental development Russell reports, \"For some years after throwing over [absolutism] I had an optimistic riot of opposite beliefs. I thought that whatever Hegel had denied must be true.\" (Russell in Barrett and Adkins 1962, p. 477) Also:\nParticularly the works of William James and F. C. S. Schiller, both founding members of pragmatism, made lifelong assaults on Absolute Idealism. James was particularly concerned with the monism that Absolute Idealism engenders, and the consequences this has for the problem of evil, free will, and moral action. Schiller, on the other hand, attacked Absolute Idealism for being too disconnected with our practical lives, and argued that its proponents failed to realize that thought is merely a tool for action rather than for making discoveries about an abstract world that fails to have any impact on us.\n\nAbsolute idealism has greatly altered the philosophical landscape. Paradoxically, (though, from a Hegelian point of view, maybe not paradoxically at all) this influence is mostly felt in the strong opposition it engendered. Both logical positivism and Analytic philosophy grew out of a rebellion against Hegelianism prevalent in England during the 19th century. Continental phenomenology, existentialism and post-modernism also seek to 'free themselves from Hegel's thought'. Martin Heidegger, one of the leading figures of Continental philosophy in the 20th century, sought to distance himself from Hegel's work. One of Heidegger's philosophical themes was \"overcoming metaphysics\".\n\n\n"}

He is a member of the organizations «Freedom From Religion Foundation» and «Defend Science» (US).\n\nAlex Battler was born in Astrakhan. In 1966 he entered the Faculty of Oriental studies of the A. Zhdanov Leningrad State University. After graduating in 1971, he enrolled in the post-graduate school at the Institute of the Far Eastern Studies in Moscow. In 1975 he was conferred the Degree of Candidate of Science (= PhD), and in 1988 his Doctor of Science dissertation in the specialty \"history of foreign policy and international relations\".\n\nIn 1993 he immigrated to Canada where he acquired Canadian citizenship. In 1997 he returned to Russia and worked at several institutions of higher learning in Moscow. In 2001 he moved to the United Kingdom; later he lived for several years in France. Currently he has permanent residence in New York.\n\nThrough the years he held various positions at different research institutions: the Institute of the Far Eastern Studies; the Institute of World Economy and International Relations; the Institute of Social Sciences of the CPSU Central Committee; Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Institute of Philosophy. He served as Director of the Institute of Economic and International Studies of the Pacific Region (Vladivostok).\n\nHe also taught as a professor of political science, economics, and international relations at several universities and institutes in Russia (Moscow State University; the Institute of Philosophy; the International Independent University of Ecology & Political Science); in Japan (Nagoya University); in Canada (the University of British Columbia).\n\nThe result of Battler's scientific work is a number of laws and regularities in the areas of philosophy, sociology and the theory of international relations; he discovered these laws based on re-interpreting key terms and turning into concepts and categories. The single most important among them is the category of \"force\" which in the book \"Dialectics of Force\" turned into ontóbia (ontological force) – one of the attributes of being, along with the categories of matter, motion, time and space. This attribute status of ontóbia enabled Battler to advance his own version of the Big Bang conception and of the Universe's expansion process. In the organic world ontóbia turns into orgábia (the organic force). From the perspective of Battler's theory, life begins with man. The ontóbia theory also makes its possible to resolve the problems of consciousness and thought, of their qualitative differences and manifestations.\n\nIn another book titled \"Society: Progress and Force (Criteria and First Principles)\" Battler formulated new definitions of the concept \"Progress\" and the forms of social forces' manifestation through the laws of force (principles): The First Principle of social development, or the law of social force; and the Second Principle of social development, or the law of social knowledge. In the book \"On Love, Family, and the State\" he presented the laws of \"love\" and \"family\", which are tied to the functioning of the law of entropy growth.\n\nWithin the framework of the international relations theory Battler formulated (in his monograph \"The 21st Century: the World without Russia\") two laws: the law of geoeconomics (poles) and the law of geostrategy (center of power). He also introduced a new concept: \"the foreign policy potential\" of a state – and methods for calculating it, as well as the optimal proportions of expenditures on foreign policy in accordance with the state's foreign policy goals.\n\nBattler describes himself as a follower of the Marxist-Leninist teaching.\n\nBattler also authored the 13 commandments of the roslyane, which he promotes as a replacement for the well-known Biblical commandments. In Battler's theory the roslyane are the people who should emerge in Russia after the current system is replaced.\n\n\n\nAlex Battler is a co-author of more than twenty collective monographs and books.

He studied Law at Lund University and was a professor of law at the University of Uppsala from 1914 to 1947. Like Hägerström, Karl Olivecrona and Alf Ross, he resists the exposition of rights as metaphysical entities, arguing that realistic legal analysis should dispense with them. Lundstedt's main focus in his theoretical work became a sustained attack on what he called the method of justice. He considered that there was no objective way to define the requirements of justice and that invocations of justice cloaked purely subjective preferences or unacceptable metaphysical claims. Instead, law and legislation should be guided by a method of social welfare centred on objective study of social conditions and of the practical effects and capabilities of law in improving society for all its members. Lundstedt was a member of the Swedish parliament for many years and promoted within it changes to the penal system and a range of other liberal reforms.\n\n\n\nDescription of 11 letters from Lundstedt on http://andreas-lukas.de/resources/Nr1.+Lundstedt+Briefe.pdf\n"}
{"id": "98921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98921", "title": "Aristoxenus", "text": "Aristoxenus\n\nAristoxenus of Tarentum (; born c. 375, fl. 335 BCE) was a Greek Peripatetic philosopher, and a pupil of Aristotle. Most of his writings, which dealt with philosophy, ethics and music, have been lost, but one musical treatise, \"Elements of Harmony\" (Greek: Ἁρμονικὰ στοιχεῖα; Latin: \"Elementa harmonica\"), survives incomplete, as well as some fragments concerning rhythm and meter. The \"Elements\" is the chief source of our knowledge of ancient Greek music.\n\nAristoxenus was born at Tarentum, and was the son of a learned musician named Spintharus (otherwise Mnesias). He learned music from his father, and having then been instructed by Lamprus of Erythrae and Xenophilus the Pythagorean, he finally became a pupil of Aristotle, whom he appears to have rivaled in the variety of his studies. According to the Suda, he heaped insults on Aristotle after his death, because Aristotle had designated Theophrastus as the next head of the Peripatetic school, a position which Aristoxenus himself had coveted having achieved great distinction as a pupil of Aristotle. This story is, however, contradicted by Aristocles, who asserts that he never mentioned Aristotle but with the greatest respect. Nothing is known of his life after the time of Aristotle's departure, apart from a comment in \"Elementa Harmonica\" concerning his works.\n\nHis writings, said to have consisted of four hundred and fifty-three books, and dealt with philosophy, ethics and music. \nAlthough his final years were in the Peripatetic School, and he hoped to succeed Aristotle on his death, Aristonexus was strongly influenced by Pythagoreanism, and was only a follower of Aristotle in so far as Aristotle was a follower of Plato and Pythagoras. Thus, as Sophie Gibson tells us, “the various philosophical influences” on Aristoxenus included growing up in the profoundly Pythagorean city of Taras (Tarentum), home also of the two Pythagoreans Archytas and Philolaus, and his father's (Pythagorean) musical background, which he inculcated into his son. Gibson tells us that, after the influence of his father:\n\nHowever, Aristoxenus disagreed with earlier Pythagorean musical theory in several respects, building on their work with ideas of his own. The only work of his that has come down to us is the three books of the \"Elements of Harmony\", an incomplete musical treatise. Aristoxenus' theory had an empirical tendency; in music he held that the notes of the scale are to be judged, not as earlier Pythagoreans had believed, by mathematical ratio, but by the ear. Vitruvius in his \"De architectura\" paraphrases the writings of Aristoxenus on music. His ideas were responded to and developed by some later theorists such as Archestratus, and his place in the methodological debate between rationalists and empiricists was commented upon by such writers as Ptolemais of Cyrene.\n\nThe Pythagorean theory that the soul is a 'harmony' of the four elements composing the body, and therefore mortal (\"nothing at all,\" in the words of Cicero), was ascribed to Aristoxenus (fr. 118-121 Wehrli) and Dicaearchus. This theory is comparable to the one offered by Simmias in Plato's \"Phaedo\".\n\nIn his \"Elements of Harmony\" (also \"Harmonics\"), Aristoxenus attempted a complete and systematic exposition of music. The first book contains an explanation of the genera of Greek music, and also of their species; this is followed by some general definitions of terms, particularly those of sound, interval, and system. In the second book Aristoxenus divides music into seven parts, which he takes to be: the genera, intervals, sounds, systems, tones or modes, mutations, and \"melopoeia\". The remainder of the work is taken up with a discussion of the many parts of music according to the order which he had himself prescribed.\n\nWhile it is often held among modern scholars that Aristoxenus rejected the opinion of the Pythagoreans that arithmetic rules were the ultimate judge of intervals and that in every system there must be found a mathematical coincidence before such a system can be said to be harmonic, it must be noted that Aristoxenus made extensive use of arithmetic terminology, notably to define varieties of semitones, and dieses in his descriptions of the various genera.\n\nIn his second book he asserted that \"by the hearing we judge of the magnitude of an interval, and by the understanding we consider its many powers.\" And further he wrote, \"that the nature of melody is best discovered by the perception of sense, and is retained by memory; and that there is no other way of arriving at the knowledge of music;\" and though, he wrote, \"others affirm that it is by the study of instruments that we attain this knowledge;\" this, he wrote, is talking wildly, \"for just as it is not necessary for him who writes an Iambic to attend to the arithmetical proportions of the feet of which it is composed, so it is not necessary for him who writes a Phrygian song to attend to the ratios of the sounds proper thereto.\" However, this should not be construed as meaning that he postulated a simplistic system of harmony resembling that of modern twelve tone theory, and especially not an equally tempered system. As he urges us to consider, \"(a)fter all, with which of the people who argue about the shades of the genera should one agree? Not everyone looks to the same division when tuning the chromatic or the enharmonic, so why should the note a ditone from mesé be called lichanos rather than a small amount higher?\"\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the nature of Aristoxenus' scales and genera deviated sharply from his predecessors. That Aristoxenus used a model for creating scales based upon the notion of a topos, or range of pitch location, is fact, however there is no reason to believe that he alone set this precedent, as he himself does not make this claim. Indeed, the idea of unfixed pitch locations that cover certain ranges, the limits of which may be defined by fixed points, is a notion that was popular until the modern fixation upon fixed pitch systems, as is indicated by baroque theoretical systems of pitch and intonation. Another way of stating this, however perhaps less accurate, is that instead of using discrete ratios to place intervals, he used continuously variable quantities.\n\nThe postulation that this resulted in the structuring of his tetrachords and the resulting scales having 'other' qualities of consonance is one that can only be accounted for by the recourse to often repeated inconsistencies amongst his interpreters and modern confirmation bias in favour of simplified twelve tone theories. Aristoxenus himself held that \"(...) two things must not be overlooked: first, that many people have mistakenly supposed us to be saying that a tone can be divided into three equal parts in a melody. They made this mistake because they did not realise that it is one thing to employ the third part of a tone, and another to divide a tone into three parts and sing all three. Secondly we accept that from a purely abstract point of view there is no least interval.\"\n\nIn book three Aristoxenus goes on to describe twenty eight laws of melodic succession, which are of great interest to those concerned with classical Greek melodic structure.\n\nPart of the second book of a work on rhythmics and metrics, \"Elementa rhythmica\", is preserved in medieval manuscript tradition.\n\nAristoxenus was also the author of a work \"On the Primary Duration\" (\"chronos\").\n\nA five-column fragment of a treatise on meter (P. Oxy. 9/2687) was published in Grenfell and Hunt's \"Oxyrhynchus Papyri\", vol. 1 (1898) and is probably by Aristoxenus.\n\nThe edition of Wehrli presents the surviving evidence for works with the following titles (not including several fragments of uncertain origin):\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The most common prayer among Christians is the \"Lord's Prayer\", which according to the gospel accounts (e.g. ) is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray. \"The Lord's Prayer\" is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.\n\nA broad, three stage characterization of prayer begins with vocal prayer, then moves on to a more structured form in terms of meditation, then reaches the multiple layers of contemplation, or intercession.\n\nThere are two basic settings for Christian prayer: corporate (or public) and private. Corporate prayer includes prayer shared within the worship setting or other public places. These prayers can be formal written prayers or informal extemporaneous prayers. Private prayer occurs with the individual praying either silently or aloud within a private setting. \nPrayer exists within multiple different worship contexts and may be structured differently. These types of contexts may include:\n\nLiturgical:\nOften seen within the Catholic Church. This is a very orthodox service, according to Catholics. Within a Catholic Mass, which is an example of a liturgical form of worship, there are bible readings and a sermon is read.\n\nOften seen within the Holy Orthodox Church. The Holy Bible is read and a sermon is read.\n\nNon- Liturgical:\nOften seen within Evangelical church, this prayer is often not scripted and would be more informal in structure. Most of these prayers would be extemporaneous.\n\nCharismatic:\nOften seen within gospel churches. It is the main form of worship in Pentecostal churches. It usually includes song and dance, and may include other artistic expressions. There may be no apparent structure, but the worshippers will be \"led by the Holy Spirit\".\n\nPrayer in the New Testament is presented as a positive command (; ). The people of God are challenged to include prayer in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage () as it is thought to bring the faithful closer to God.\n\nThroughout the New Testament, prayer is shown to be God's appointed method by which the faithful obtain what he has to bestow (; ; ).\n\nPrayer, according to the Book of Acts, can be seen at the first moments of the church (). The apostles regarded prayer as an essential part of their lives (; ; ). As such, the apostles frequently incorporated verses from Psalms into their writings. for example is borrowed from and other psalms.\n\nThus, due to this emphasis on prayer in the early church. lengthy passages of the New Testament are prayers or canticles (see also the Book of Odes), such as the Prayer for forgiveness (), the Lord's Prayer, the Magnificat (), the Benedictus (), Jesus' prayer to the one true God (), exclamations such as, \"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (), the Believers' Prayer (), \"may this cup be taken from me\" (), \"Pray that you will not fall into temptation\" (), Saint Stephen's Prayer (), Simon Magus' Prayer (), \"pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men\" (), and Maranatha ().\n\nElements of the oldest Christian prayers may be found in liturgies such as the Roman Catholic Mass, the Orthodox Divine Liturgy, the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, and the Lutheran Book of Worship.\n\nMany denominations that adhere to a liturgical tradition use specific prayers geared to the season of the Liturgical Year, such as Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter. Some of these prayers are found in the Roman Breviary, the Liturgy of the Hours, the Orthodox Book of Needs and the Anglican Book of Common Prayer.\n\nThe ancient church, in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, developed a tradition of asking for the intercession of (deceased) saints, and this remains the practice of most Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and some Anglican churches. Churches of the Protestant Reformation however rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ. The reformer Huldrych Zwingli admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was idolatrous.\n\nChristian meditation is a structured attempt to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of God. The word meditation comes from the Latin word \"meditārī\", which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study and to practice. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.\n\nChristian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.\n\nAt times there may be no clear-cut boundary between Christian meditation and Christian contemplation, and they overlap. Meditation serves as a foundation on which the contemplative life stands, the practice by which someone begins the state of contemplation. In contemplative prayer, this activity is curtailed, so that contemplation has been described as \"a gaze of faith\", \"a silent love\".\n\nMeditation and contemplation are components of the Rosary, encouraged by the Magisterium.\n\nThis kind of prayer involves the believer taking the role of an intercessor, praying on behalf of another individual, group or community, or even a nation.\n\nEjaculatory prayer is the use of very brief exclamations. Saint Augustine remarked that the Egyptian Christians who withdrew to a solitary life \"are said to say frequent prayers, but very brief ones that are tossed off as in a rush, so that a vigilant and keen intention, which is very necessary for one who prays, may not fade away and grow dull over longer periods\".\n\nExamples of such prayers are given in the old \"Raccolta\" under the numbers 19, 20, 38, 57, 59, 63, 77, 82, 83, 133, 154, 166, 181.</ref>The Raccolta: Index of prayers and pious works contained in this collection</ref>\n\nThey are also known as aspirations, invocations or exclamations and include the Jesus Prayer.\n\nJohnson's Dictionary defined \"ejaculation\" as \"a short prayer darted out occasionally, without solemn retirement\". Such pious ejaculations are part also of the liturgy of the Church of England.\n\nListening prayer is a type of Christian prayer. As compared with the traditional Christian prayer, the listening prayer method demands \"hearing and discerning God's voice through prayer and scripture; then obeying the Lord's direction in personal ministry.\"\n\nTraditional Christian prayer requested people to thank God, as well as tell God their own request. When their prayers seemed unanswered, some would feel that God did not hear them or did not respond to them. Listening prayer asks: \"Was it that God did not respond to you, or was it that you did not hear from God\"? Listening prayer requires those praying to calm their minds down and read the Scripture. During the reading, some sentences may pop into mind, as if in answer to their prayers but listening prayers are also of two types one is normally listening to church father and second is prayer with music nowadays prayer with music is considered as payer music or prayer song.\n\nPrayer books as well as tools such as prayer beads such as chaplets are used by Christians. Images and icons are also associated with prayers in some Christian denominations.\n\nThere is no one prayerbook containing a set liturgy used by all Christians; however many Christian denominations have their own local prayerbooks, for example:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "178942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178942", "title": "Conceptual art", "text": "Conceptual art\n\nConceptual art, sometimes simply called conceptualism, is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions. This method was fundamental to American artist Sol LeWitt's definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:\n\nTony Godfrey, author of \"Conceptual Art (Art & Ideas)\" (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art, a notion that Joseph Kosuth elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, \"Art after Philosophy\" (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth (who became the american editor of Art-Language), and Lawrence Weiner began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see below). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.\nThrough its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the UK, \"conceptual art\" came to denote all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture. It could be said that one of the reasons why the term \"conceptual art\" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist Mel Bochner suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet \"conceptual\", it is not always entirely clear what \"concept\" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with \"intention\". Thus, in describing or defining a work of art as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as \"conceptual\" with an artist's \"intention\".\n\nThe French artist Marcel Duchamp paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the readymades, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was \"Fountain\" (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym \"R.Mutt\", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it). The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future \"conceptualists\" was later acknowledged by US artist Joseph Kosuth in his 1969 essay, \"Art after Philosophy\", when he wrote: \"All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually\".\n\nIn 1956 the founder of Lettrism, Isidore Isou, developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called \"Art esthapériste\" (or \"infinite-aesthetics\"), derived from the infinitesimals of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation () of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.\n\nIn 1961 the term \"concept art\", coined by the artist Henry Flynt in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-Fluxus publication \"An Anthology of Chance Operations\". \nHowever, it assumed a different meaning when employed by Joseph Kosuth and by the English Art and Language group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 \"Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects\", the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the New York Cultural Center.\n\nConceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against formalism as then articulated by the influential New York art critic Clement Greenberg. According to Greenberg Modern art followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, formal nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as figuration, 3-D perspective illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.\n\nSome have argued that conceptual art continued this \"dematerialization\" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,\nwhile others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.\nConceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. Lawrence Weiner said: \"Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it.\" Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of Robert Barry, Yoko Ono, and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the \"art\" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft, where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's \"written instructions\" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.\n\nLanguage was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists Lawrence Weiner, Edward Ruscha, Joseph Kosuth, Robert Barry, and Art & Language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching composition (e.g. Synthetic Cubism), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right. Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, \"The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles.\"\n\nThe British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art Peter Osborne suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American analytic philosophy, and structuralist and post structuralist Continental philosophy during the middle of the twentieth century. This linguistic turn \"reinforced and legitimized\" the direction the conceptual artists took. Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art. Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is \"post-conceptual\" in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in Como on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the ontology of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).\n\nThe American art historian Edward A. Shanken points to the example of Roy Ascott who \"powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories.\" Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with cybernetic art in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of cybernetics was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, \"The Construction of Change\" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of Lucy R. Lippard's seminal \"Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972\", Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 , which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's \"Second Investigation, Proposition 1\" (1968) and Mel Ramsden's \"Elements of an Incomplete Map\" (1968).\n\n\"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art & Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials.\"\nAn important difference between conceptual art and more \"traditional\" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. John Baldessari, for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. Stelarc, Marina Abramović) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.\n\nThe first wave of the \"conceptual art\" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early \"concept\" artists like Henry Flynt, Robert Morris, and Ray Johnson influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like Dan Graham, Hans Haacke, and Lawrence Weiner have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as Mike Kelley or Tracey Emin are sometimes labeled \"second- or third-generation\" conceptualists, or \"post-conceptual\" artists.\n\nMany of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves \"conceptual artists\", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with installation art, performance art, net.art and electronic/digital art.\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nEssays\n\n\nExhibition catalogues\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32828899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32828899", "title": "Constance Vella", "text": "Constance Vella\n\nConstance Vella (1687–1759) was a major Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in physics, logic, cosmology, and metaphysics. Vella’s speciality is that, despite being a Scholastic, he was not an Aristotelic-Thomist one (as most of the well-known mediaeval philosophers are), but rather an Aristotelic-Scotist philosopher, that is more in the line of John Duns Scotus.\n\nVella was born at Valletta, Malta, and joined the Franciscan Order, probably as a teenager. He was one of the best professors of philosophy whom the Franciscan ever had at their College of Philosophy and Literature at Rabat, Malta. He lectured there between 1712 and 1715. Amongst his most talented students there was John Constance Parnis. In fact, Vella was a kind of master with a school of disciples who not only followed his intellectual endeavours but also continued to teach his doctrines after his death. Vella even lectured successfully in Sicily, where he was also renowned as an endowed preacher.\n\nIn 1729, Vella was chosen as Provincial Minister of the Franciscan Province of Sicily and Malta. In Malta, he was also signed up as Sinodal Examiner, and worked under bishops Paul Alpheran de Bussan, and Bartolomeo Rull. In 1744, the former bishop further appointed Vella as Co-Visitor for the diocese of Malta. He was held in very high esteem both as an administrator as well as a philosopher. He died on November 1, 1759.\n\nVella’s most representative work in philosophy is a three-volume \"opus\" called Scoticæ Philosophiæ (\"Scotist Philosophy\"), composed between 1712 and 1715. Two identical copies of the manuscript exist, which for such a mediaeval document is a unique rather than a rare occurrence. One copy is held at the archives of the Franciscan friars in Valletta, Malta, and the other at the archives of the Archbishop’s Seminary at Rabat, Malta (here marked as MS. 19). Together the three volumes have a staggering 1,926 back to back folios. \n\nVolume I, containing 580 back to back folios, has just one \"Tractatus\" (or studies), entitled \"De Logica\" (\"On Logic\"), which is of course about Aristotelian logic. Volume II, made up of 615 back to back folios, includes two \"Tractatus\" (or studies), one, \"In Octo Aristotelis Libros De Physico Auditu\" (\"On the Eight Books of Aristotle on Physics\"), and the other, \"De Cælo et Mundo\" (\"On the Heavens and the Earth\"). The former deals with Aristotle’s physics, of course, and the latter with Aristotelian cosmology. Volume III comprises 731 back to back folios. It contains five \"Tractatus\" (or studies), which are the following: \"De Generatione et Corrupione\" (\"On Coming-To-Be and Passing Away\"), \"De Meteoris\" (\"On Meteors\"), \"De Anima\" (\"On the Soul\"), \"Compendiaria Notitia eorum quæ Mirabilem Humani Corporis Structuram Componunt\" (\"A Compendium of Information concerning Parts which Form the Marvellous Structure of the Human Body\"), and \"Tractatus in XII Aristotelis Stagirite Libros Metaphysicorum\" (\"Study on the 12th Book of Aristotle the Stagirite’s ‘Metaphysics’\").\n\nOther extant works of Vella are of a theological nature. They include \"Tractatus in Tertium Librum Sententiarum\" (\"A Study on the Third Book of Peter Lombard’s ‘Sentences’\"; 1715), \"Selva Morale\" (\"An Assorted Study of Morals\"; undated), and \"Selva Santorale\" (\"An Assorted Study of Liturgical Rites\"; undated).\n\nAll of Vella’s works contain a lattice of subtle philosophical arguments which make them masterworks of a first class philosopher. He spares no effort to be consistent, thorough, perfectly clear, and illuminating.\n\nApart from the \"Compendium\", all the other works of Vella are basically commentaries on the respective works of Aristotle from the point of view of a Scotist Scholastic. Throughout he makes his position clear while demonstrating his disagreement with the prevailing Thomist interpretation.\n\nIn terms of novelty and originality, on the other hand, the \"Compendium\" is the most interesting. As its title suggests, Vella deals with the physical constitution of the human body. He takes each physical organ on its own, explains their nature and function, and examines their relationship to other organs and to the body as a whole. He particularly demonstrates an acute appreciation of things physical in general, and also of their organisational structure.\n\nUnfortunately, Vella is not very known amongst philosophy academics and intellectuals. Like almost all the other mediaeval Maltese philosophers, his philosophy is still wholly inaccessible. The reason being that his works have never been transliterated from their original manuscript form, and neither have they been translated, in whole or in part, into any modern language. Thus, as yet they remain unread and unstudied by contemporary scholars. \n\nThis is indeed a great pity. For Vella surely merits attentive study and much larger appreciation, not only in a historical sort of way, but academically and philosophically. Together with John Matthew Rispoli, he might well be a long neglected gem of fascinating intellectual stimulation.\n\n\nPhilosophy in Malta\n"}
{"id": "625569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625569", "title": "Constantin Brunner", "text": "Constantin Brunner\n\nConstantin Brunner (1862–1937) was the pen-name of the German Jewish philosopher Arjeh Yehuda Wertheimer (called Leo). He was born in Altona (near Hamburg) on 27 August 1862. He came from a prominent Jewish family that had lived in the vicinity of Hamburg for generations; his grandfather, Akiba Wertheimer, was chief Rabbi of Altona and Schleswig-Holstein. Brunner studied philosophy under a number of prominent scholars, but never completed his doctorate. He established himself as a literary critic, and enjoyed a wide celebrity. In the 1890s, he withdrew from public life to devote himself to writing. He lived in Germany until 1933, when, with the rise to power of the Nazi party, he moved to The Hague, where he died on 27 August 1937.\n\nCentral to Brunner’s theory is the characterization of three different modes of mental activity:\n\n\nEach of the three modes of thought consists of three specificates. In the practical understanding, the specificates are feeling, knowing and willing. In spiritual life, these are modified to become, respectively, art, philosophy and mysticism (love). Superstition distorts the specificates of spiritual life, transforming them into religion, metaphysics and moralism.\n\nBrunner's intention is to contrast popular thought with spiritual/intellectual thought. His work \"Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volke\" is a survey of the whole of human intellectual history seen from the point of view of this doctrine.\n\nBrunner's ultimate objective was to prepare the way for the establishment of a community centered on the life of the mind, which would in turn open the way to the expansion of democracy.\n\nThe opposition between the spiritual and the religious is a major theme in Brunner's work. He contends that Judaism is essentially anti-religious, stating in \"Our Christ\" that \"Judaism as a spiritual doctrine is the opposite of religion and a protest against it\", and culminates his argument with his own translation of the Shema: \"Hear O Israel, Being is our god, Being is one\". He juxtaposes priestly/pharisaic/rabbinic to prophetic Judaism, stating that the latter represents the true mystical essence in opposition to the former which distorts that essence.\n\nFor Brunner, Jesus was both a mystic and a genius, whereas Christian religion is largely a distortion of his thought. \n\nThroughout his life, Brunner was anti-Zionist. However, there is evidence that, toward the end of his life in light of events in Europe, he was reconsidering his opposition to the founding of the state of Israel (see \"Assimilation und Nationalismus: ein Briefwechsel mit Constantin Brunner\" / Willy Aron).\n\nAccording to Brunner, the authentic philosophy presented by Spinoza has its antithesis in scholasticism which reaches its highest expression in Immanuel Kant. Thus Spinoza and Kant represent opposite poles in the dialectical idealism by which Brunner organizes the whole of intellectual history.\n\nBrunner maintains that the foundation of all science is the doctrine of universal all-motion. His elaboration of this doctrine has had a decisive effect on a number of medical practitioners and researchers.\n\nBrunner's position is that the fixity of the genus is a scientific principle that needs to be preserved if meaningful work is to be undertaken with biological systems. He argued that because the theory of evolution undermined the notion of genus, it would be detrimental to practical scientific endeavor.\n\nIn \"Confessions of a European Intellectual\", Franz Schoenberner describes Brunner as \"one of the more important figures\" in Europe. Brunner corresponded with Walther Rathenau, Martin Buber, Gustav Landauer and Lou Andreas-Salomé. Albert Einstein read Brunner but, while appreciating his critical insight and sharing his devotion to Spinoza, rejected his philosophy, particularly where it stood opposed to Kant \n\nBrunner attracted a large and devoted following among the Jewish youth in Czernowitz. The best known of his disciples in this group is the poet, Rose Ausländer.\n\nWith the Second World War, Brunner's books were burned and his devotees scattered. His German disciple Magdalena Kasch managed to save the bulk of Brunner's writing from destruction by the Nazis. In 1948, she, with the help of some of Brunner's other surviving friends, founded the \"Internationaal Constantin Brunner Institut\" (ICBI) in the Hague. However, there has been no major revival of interest in his work, despite the efforts of such luminaries as Yehudi Menuhin and André Breton.\n\nBrunner's works available in English include\n\n\nThere is relatively abundant secondary literature available in English, notably \"To live is to think : the thought of twentieth-century German philosopher Constantin Brunner\" by Hans Goetz (1995).\n\nSeveral works by Brunner are available in French. \"L'amour\" is the first part of Brunner's work on sexual relationships. \"Spinoza contre Kant\" contains Brunner's sketch of the history of modern philosophy. \"Le malheur de notre peuple allemand et nos « Völkisch »\" (orig. 1924) warns against the dangers of Nazism. The Sorbonne has an archive of several French translations of Brunner's work by Henri Lurié. There is abundant secondary material in French as well, notably a recent work by Martin Rodan entitled \"Notre culture européenne, cette inconnue\" (Peter Lang, 2009).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "412185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=412185", "title": "Critical rationalism", "text": "Critical rationalism\n\nCritical rationalism is an epistemological philosophy advanced by Karl Popper. Popper wrote about critical rationalism in his works: \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\", \"The Open Society and its Enemies\", \"Conjectures and Refutations\", \"The Myth of the Framework\", and \"Unended Quest\". Ernest Gellner is another notable proponent of this approach.\n\nCritical rationalists hold that scientific theories and any other claims to knowledge can and should be rationally criticized, and (if they have empirical content) can and should be subjected to tests which may falsify them. Thus claims to knowledge may be contrastingly and normatively evaluated. They are either falsifiable and thus empirical (in a very broad sense), or not falsifiable and thus non-empirical. Those claims to knowledge that are potentially falsifiable can then be admitted to the body of empirical science, and then further differentiated according to whether they are retained or are later actually falsified. If retained, further differentiation may be made on the basis of how much subjection to criticism they have received, how severe such criticism has been, and how probable the theory is, with the least probable theory that still withstands attempts to falsify it being the one to be preferred. That it is the \"least\" probable theory that is to be preferred is one of the contrasting differences between critical rationalism and classical views on science, such as positivism, who hold that one should instead accept the \"most\" probable theory. (The least probable theory is the one with the highest information content and most open to future falsification.)\nCritical Rationalism as a discourse positioned itself against what its proponents took to be epistemologically relativist philosophies, particularly post-modernist or sociological approaches to knowledge. Critical rationalism has it that knowledge is objective (in the sense of being embodied in various substrates and in the sense of not being reducible to what humans individually \"know\"), and also that truth is objective (exists independently of social mediation or individual perception, but is \"really real\").\n\nHowever, this contrastive, critical approach to objective knowledge is quite different from more traditional views that also hold knowledge to be objective. (These include the classical rationalism of the Enlightenment, the verificationism of the logical positivists, or approaches to science based on induction, a supposed form of logical inference which critical rationalists reject, in line with David Hume.) For criticism is all that can be done when attempting to differentiate claims to knowledge, according to the critical rationalist. Reason is the organon of criticism, not of support; of tentative refutation, not of proof.\n\nSupposed positive evidence (such as the provision of \"good reasons\" for a claim, or its having been \"corroborated\" by making successful predictions) actually does nothing to bolster, support, or prove a claim, belief, or theory.\n\nIn this sense, critical rationalism turns the normal understanding of a traditional rationalist, and a realist, on its head. Especially the view that a theory is better if it is less likely to be true is in direct opposition to the traditional positivistic view, which holds that one should seek for theories that have a high probability. Popper notes that this \"may illustrate Schopenhauer's remark that the solution of a problem often first looks like a paradox and later like a truism\". Even a highly unlikely theory that conflicts current observation (and is thus false, like \"all swans are white\") must be considered to be better than one which fits observations perfectly, but is highly probable (like \"all swans have a color\"). This insight is the crucial difference between naive falsificationism and critical rationalism. The lower probability theory is favoured by critical rationalism because the higher the informative content of a theory the lower will be its probability, for the more information a statement contains, the greater will be the number of ways in which it may turn out to be false. The rationale behind this is simply to make it as easy as possible to find out whether the theory is false so that it can be replaced by one that is closer to the truth. It is not meant as a concession to justificatory epistemology, like assuming a theory to be \"justifiable\" by asserting that it is highly unlikely and yet fits observation.\n\nCritical rationalism rejects the classical position that knowledge is justified true belief; it instead holds the exact opposite: That, in general, knowledge is unjustified untrue unbelief. It is unjustified because of the non-existence of good reasons. It is untrue, because it usually contains errors that sometimes remain unnoticed for hundreds of years. And it is not belief either, because scientific knowledge, or the knowledge needed to build a plane, is contained in no single person's mind. It is only available as the content of books.\n\nWilliam Warren Bartley compared critical rationalism to the very general philosophical approach to knowledge which he called justificationism, the view that scientific theories can be justified. Most justificationists do not know that they are justificationists. Justificationism is what Popper called a \"subjectivist\" view of truth, in which the question of whether some statement is true, is confused with the question of whether it can be justified (established, proven, verified, warranted, made well-founded, made reliable, grounded, supported, legitimated, based on evidence) in some way.\n\nAccording to Bartley, some justificationists are positive about this mistake. They are naïve rationalists, and thinking that their knowledge can indeed be founded, in principle, it may be deemed certain to some degree, and rational.\n\nOther justificationists are negative about these mistakes. They are epistemological relativists, and think (rightly, according to the critical rationalist) that you cannot \"find\" knowledge, that there is no source of epistemological absolutism. But they conclude (wrongly, according to the critical rationalist) that there is therefore no rationality, and no objective distinction to be made between the true and the false.\n\nBy dissolving justificationism itself, the critical rationalist (a proponent of non-justificationism) regards knowledge and rationality, reason and science, as neither foundational nor infallible, but nevertheless does not think we must therefore all be relativists. Knowledge and truth still exist, just not in the way we thought.\n\nThe rejection of \"positivist\" approaches to knowledge occurs due to various pitfalls that positivism falls into.\n\n1. The naïve empiricism of induction was shown to be illogical by Hume. A thousand observations of some event A coinciding with some event B does not allow one to logically infer that all A events coincide with B events. According to the critical rationalist, if there is a sense in which humans accrue knowledge positively by experience, it is only by pivoting observations off existing conjectural theories pertinent to the observations, or off underlying cognitive schemas which unconsciously handle perceptions and use them to generate new theories. But these new theories advanced in response to perceived particulars are not \"logically\" \"induced\" from them. These new theories may be wrong. The myth that we \"induce\" theories from particulars is persistent because \"when\" we do this we are often successful, but this is due to the advanced state of our evolved tendencies. If we were really \"inducting\" theories from particulars, it would be inductively logical to claim that the sun sets \"because\" I get up in the morning, or that all buses must have drivers in them (if you've never seen an empty bus).\n\n2. Popper and David Miller showed in 1983 that evidence supposed to partly support a hypothesis can, in fact, only be neutral to, or even be counter-supportive of the hypothesis.\n\n3. Related to the point above, David Miller, attacks the use of \"good reasons\" in general (including evidence supposed to support the excess content of a hypothesis). He argues that good reasons are neither attainable, nor even desirable. Basically, Miller asserts that all arguments purporting to give valid support for a claim are either circular or question-begging. That is, if one provides a valid deductive argument (an inference from premises to a conclusion) for a given claim, then the content of the claim must already be contained within the premises of the argument (if it is not, then the argument is ampliative and so is invalid). Therefore, the claim is already presupposed by the premises, and is no more \"supported\" than are the assumptions upon which the claim rests, i.e. begging the question.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1014250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1014250", "title": "Degeneration theory", "text": "Degeneration theory\n\nSocial degeneration was a widely influential concept at the interface of the social and biological sciences in the 19th century. Degenerationists feared that civilization might be in decline and that the causes of decline lay in biological change. These ideas derived from pre-scientific concepts of heredity (\"hereditary taint\") with Lamarckian emphasis on biological development through purpose and habit. Degeneration concepts were often associated with authoritarian political attitudes, including militarism and racist science, as well as with fears of national decline. The theory originated in racial concepts of ethnicity, recorded in the writings of such medical scientists as Johann Blumenbach and Robert Knox. From the 1850s, it became influential in psychiatry through the writings of Bénédict Morel, and in criminology with Cesare Lombroso. By the 1890s, in the work of Max Nordau and others, degeneration became a more general concept in social commentary.\n\nThe meaning of \"degeneration\" was poorly defined, but can be described as an organism's change from a more complex to a simpler, less differentiated form, and is associated with 19th century conceptions of biological devolution. Although rejected by Charles Darwin, the theory's application to the social sciences was supported by some evolutionary biologists, most notably Ernst Haeckel and Ray Lankester. As the 19th century wore on, the increasing emphasis on degeneration reflected an anxious pessimism about the resilience of European civilization and its possible decline and collapse.\n\nThe concept of degeneration arose during the European enlightenment and the industrial revolution - a period of profound social change and a rapidly shifting sense of personal identity. Several influences were involved.\n\nThe first related to the extreme demographic upheavals, including urbanization, in the early years of the 19th century. The disturbing experience of social change and urban crowds, largely unknown in the agrarian 18th century, was recorded in the journalism of William Cobbett, the novels of Charles Dickens and in the paintings of J M W Turner. These changes were also explored by early writers on social psychology, including Gustav Le Bon and Georg Simmel. The psychological impact of industrialisation is comprehensively described in Humphrey Jennings' masterly anthology \"Pandaemonium 1660 - 1886\". Victorian social reformers including Edwin Chadwick, Henry Mayhew and Charles Booth voiced realistic concerns about the decline of public health in the urban life of the British working class (urban squalor), arguing for improved housing and sanitation, access to parks and recreational facilities, an improved diet and a reduction in alcohol intake. These contributions from the public health perspective were discussed by the Scottish physician Sir James Cantlie in his 1885 lectures \"Degeneration Amongst Londoners\". The novel experience of everyday contact with the urban working classes gave rise to a kind of horrified fascination with their perceived reproductive energies which appeared to threaten middle-class culture.\n\nSecondly, the proto-evolutionary biology and transformatist speculations of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and other natural historians—taken together with the Baron von Cuvier's theory of extinctions—played an important part in establishing a sense of the unsettled aspects of the natural world. The polygenic theories of multiple human origins, supported by Robert Knox in his book \"The Races of Men\" (1850), were firmly rejected by Charles Darwin who, following James Cowles Prichard, generally agreed a single African origin for the entire human species.\n\nThirdly, the development of world trade and colonialism, the early European experience of globalization, resulted in an awareness of the vulnerabilities of western civilization.\n\nFinally, the growth of historical scholarship in the 18th century, exemplified by Edward Gibbon's \"The History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire\" (1776–1789), excited a renewed interest in the narratives of historical decline. This resonated uncomfortably with the difficulties of French political life in the post-revolutionary nineteenth century.\nDegeneration theory achieved a detailed articulation in Bénédict Morel's \"Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species\" (1857), a complicated work of clinical commentary from an asylum in Normandy (Saint Yon in Rouen) which, in the popular imagination at least, coalesced with de Gobineau's \"Essay on The Inequality of the Human Races\" (1855). Morel's concept of \"mental degeneration\" - in which he believed that intoxication and addiction in one generation of a family would lead to hysteria, epilepsy, sexual perversions, insanity, learning disability and sterility in subsequent generations - is an example of Lamarckian biological thinking and Morel's medical discussions are reminiscent of the clinical literature surrounding syphilitic infection (\"syphilography\"). Morel's psychiatric theories were taken up and advocated by his friend Philippe Buchez, and through his political influence became an official doctrine in French legal and administrative medicine.\n\nArthur de Gobineau came from an impoverished family (with a domineering and adulterous mother) which claimed an aristocratic ancestry; he was a failed author of historical romances and his wife was widely rumored to be a Créole from Martinique. de Gobineau nevertheless argued that the course of history and civilization was largely determined by ethnic factors, and that interracial marriage (\"miscegenation\") resulted in social chaos. de Gobineau built a successful career in the French diplomatic service, living for extended periods in Iran and Brazil, and spent his later years travelling through Europe, lamenting his mistreatment at the hands of his wife and daughters. He died of a heart attack in 1882 while boarding a train in Turin. His work was well received in German translation—not least by the composer Richard Wagner—and the leading German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin later wrote extensively on the dangers posed by degeneration to the German people. de Gobineau's writings exerted an enormous influence on the thinkers antecedent to the Third Reich - although they are curiously free of anti-Semitic prejudice. Quite different historical factors inspired the Italian Cesare Lombroso in his work on criminal anthropology and the notion of \"atavistic retrogression\", probably shaped by his experiences as a young army doctor in Calabria during the \"risorgimento\".\n\nIn England, degeneration received a scientific formulation from Ray Lankester whose detailed discussions of the biology of parasitism were hugely influential; and the poor physical condition of many recruits for the second South African war (1899-1902) caused alarm in British government circles. The psychiatrist Henry Maudsley initially argued that degenerate family lines would die out with little social consequence, but later became more pessimistic about the effects of degeneration on the British population.\n\nIn the \"fin-de-siècle\" period, Max Nordau scored an unexpected success with his bestselling \"Degeneration\" (1892). Sigmund Freud met Nordau in 1885 while he was studying in Paris and was notably unimpressed by him and hostile to the degeneration concept. Degeneration fell from popular and fashionable favor around the time of the First World War, although some of its preoccupations persisted in the writings of the eugenicists and social Darwinists. Oswald Spengler's \"The Decline of the West\" (1919) captured something of the degenerationist spirit in the aftermath of the war.\n\n \n\nThe earliest uses of the term \"degeneration\" can be found in the writings of Blumenbach and Buffon at the end of the 18th century, when these early writers on natural history considered scientific approaches to the human species. With the taxonomic mind-set of natural historians, they drew attention to the different ethnic groupings of mankind, and raised general enquiries about their relationships, with the idea that racial groupings could be explained by environmental effects on a common ancestral stock. This pre-Darwinian belief in the heritability of acquired characteristics does not accord with modern genetics. An alternative view of the multiple origins of different racial groups, called \"polygenic theories\", was also rejected by Charles Darwin, who favored explanations in terms of differential geographic migrations from a single, probably African, population.\nThe theory of degeneration found its first detailed presentation in the writings of Bénédict Morel (1809–1873), especially in his \"Traité des dégénérescences physiques, intellectuelles et morales de l'espèce humaine\" (\"Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species\") (1857). This book was published two years \"before\" Darwin's \"Origin of Species\". Morel was a highly regarded psychiatrist, the very successful superintendent of the Rouen asylum for almost twenty years and a fastidious recorder of the family histories of his variously disabled patients. Through the details of these family histories, Morel discerned an hereditary line of defective parents infected by pollutants and stimulants; a second generation liable to epilepsy, neurasthenia, sexual deviations and hysteria; a third generation prone to insanity; and a final generation doomed to congenital idiocy and sterility. In 1857, Morel proposed a theory of \"hereditary degeneracy\", bringing together environmental and hereditary elements in an uncompromisingly pre-Darwinian mix. Morel's contribution was further developed by Valentin Magnan (1835–1916), who stressed the role of alcohol—particularly \"absinthe\"—in the generation of psychiatric disorders.\n\nMorel's ideas were greatly extended by the Italian medical scientist Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909) whose work was defended and translated into English by Havelock Ellis. In his \"L'uomo delinquente\" (1876), Lombroso outlined a comprehensive natural history of the socially deviant person and detailed the \"stigmata\" of the person who was born to be \"criminally insane\". These included a low, sloping forehead, hard and shifty eyes, large, handle-shaped ears, a flattened or upturned nose, a forward projection of the jaw, irregular teeth, prehensile toes and feet, long simian arms and a scanty beard and baldness. Lombroso also listed the features of the degenerate mentality, supposedly released by the disinhibition of the primitive neurological centres. These included apathy, the loss of moral sense, a tendency to impulsiveness or self-doubt, an unevenness of mental qualities such as unusual memory or aesthetic abilities, a tendency to mutism or to verbosity, excessive originality, preoccupation with the self, mystical interpretations placed on simple facts or perceptions, the abuse of symbolic meanings and the magical use of words, or \"mantras\". Lombroso, with his concept of \"atavistic retrogression\", suggested an evolutionary reversion, complementing \"hereditary degeneracy\", and his work in the medical examination of criminals in Turin resulted in his theory of criminal anthropology—a constitutional notion of abnormal personality that was not actually supported by his own scientific investigations. In his later life, Lombroso developed an obsession with spiritualism, engaging with the spirit of his long dead mother.\n\nIn 1892, Max Nordau, an expatriate Hungarian living in Paris, published his extraordinary bestseller \"Degeneration\", which greatly extended the concepts of Bénédict Morel and Cesare Lombroso (to whom he dedicated the book) to the entire civilization of western Europe, and transformed the medical connotations of degeneration into a generalized \"cultural criticism\". Adopting some of Charcot's neurological vocabulary, Nordau identified a number of weaknesses in contemporary Western culture which he characterized in terms of \"ego-mania\", i.e., narcissism and hysteria. He also emphasized the importance of \"fatigue\", \"enervation\" and \"ennui\". Nordau, appalled by the anti-Semitism surrounding the Dreyfus affair, devoted his later years to Zionist politics. Degeneration theory fell from favour around the time of the First World War because of an improved understanding of the mechanisms of genetics as well as the increasing vogue for psychoanalytic thinking. However, some of its preoccupations lived on in the world of eugenics and social Darwinism. It is notable that the Nazi attack on western liberal society was largely couched in terms of degenerate art with its associations of racial miscegenation and fantasies of racial purity—and included as its target almost all modernist cultural experiment.\n\nTowards the close of the 19th century, in the fin-de-siècle period, something of an obsession with decline, descent and degeneration invaded the European creative imagination, partly fuelled by widespread misconceptions of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Among the main examples are the symbolist literary work of Charles Baudelaire, the Rougon-Macquart novels of Émile Zola, Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\"—published in the same year (1886) as Richard von Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\"—and, subsequently, Oscar Wilde's only novel (containing his aesthetic manifesto) \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1891). In \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" (1891), Thomas Hardy explores the destructive consequences of a family myth of noble ancestry. Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen showed a sensitivity to degenerationist thinking in his theatrical presentations of Scandinavian domestic crises. Arthur Machen's \"The Great God Pan\" (1890/1894), with its emphasis on the horrors of psychosurgery, is frequently cited as an essay on degeneration. A scientific twist was added by H.G. Wells in \"The Time Machine\" (1895) in which Wells prophesied the splitting of the human race into differently degenerate forms, and again, a little later, in his \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\" (1896). Joseph Conrad alludes to degeneration theory in his treatment of political radicalism in the 1907 novel \"The Secret Agent\".\n\nIn her influential study \"The Gothic Body\", Kelly Hurley draws attention to the literary device of the \"abhuman\" as a representation of damaged personal identity, and to lesser-known authors in the field, including Richard Marsh (1857-1915), author of \"The Beetle\" (1897), and William Hope Hodgson (1877–1918), author of \"The Boats of the Glen Carrig\", \"The House on the Borderland\" and \"The Night Land\". In 1897, Bram Stoker published \"Dracula\", an enormously influential Gothic novel featuring the parasitic vampire Count Dracula in an extended exercise of reversed imperialism. Unusually, Stoker makes explicit reference to the writings of Lombroso and Nordau in the course of the novel. Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories include a host of degenerationist tropes, perhaps best illustrated (drawing on the ideas of Serge Voronoff) in \"The Adventure of the Creeping Man\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "254204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254204", "title": "Honor system", "text": "Honor system\n\nAn honor system or honesty system is a philosophical way of running a variety of endeavors based on trust, honor, and honesty. Something that operates under the rule of the \"honor system\" is usually something that does not have strictly enforced rules governing its principles. In British English, it would more often be called a \"trust system\" and should not be confused with the British honours system.\n\nThe honor system is also a system granting freedom from customary surveillance (as to students or prisoners) with the understanding that those who are so freed will be bound by their honor to observe regulations (e.g. prison farms are operated under the honor system), and will therefore not abuse the trust placed in them.\n\nA person engaged in an honor system has a strong negative concept of breaking or going against it. The negatives may include community shame, loss of status, loss of a personal sense of integrity and pride or in extreme situations, banishment from one's community.\n\nThere are various types of honor systems that may be employed. A total honor system makes no checks on its users to verify their honesty, thereby easily allowing the system to be cheated. Though the system may face occasional audits, there would be no way thereafter of learning the identity of the violator. Some are simply contingent upon the truthfulness presumed of users; others are present when the losses caused by those who may cheat the system are less costly than a higher security system.\n\nOther honor systems employ random checks of selected users to ensure they are in compliance. A minority of users will undergo this check, while the remainder will be given a chance to get away with a violation. In these cases, the management of the system hopes that the fear of getting checked will coerce users into compliance.\n\nIn some places, public transport such as trains, trams and/or buses operate on an honor system called proof-of-payment. The local government authorities may find it impractical or overly expensive to install ticket-checking turnstiles at every station, and instead rely on casual human surveillance to check if all riders possess tickets. In such a system one could thus ride the train or bus without paying, and simply hope to be lucky enough to avoid a random ticket check during the trip. Such behavior is impossible for an honor system by itself to prevent. High penalties tend to be used to offset the financial cost of non-paying riders.\n\nSome toll roads, including the Sawgrass Expressway near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, have unstaffed toll booths in which motorists are expected to pay their tolls. When a violation occurs, an alarm may sound, and the vehicle may be photographed, but .\nAt many Western airports, arriving international passengers are instructed by signs either to walk through one door (usually green) if they have nothing to declare, or a different door (usually red) if they have something to declare. Forcible screening is rare, though customs officers generally have authority to check persons suspected of falsely using the green channel. Items that must be declared commonly include cash, food, alcohol, luxury items, publications, weapons, tobacco, etc. Most other items, including personal belongings such as regular clothing, need not be declared. However, X-ray scans can reveal what items must be declared. \n\nSome hotels, mostly in continental Europe, operate an honesty bar, allowing guests to serve and record their own drinks and saving the cost of a night bartender. Patrons could theoretically lie about their drink consumption, and the hotel would have only limited powers to verify their claims. The concept of hotel \"mini-bars\" in the United States and Canada is similar, although the stock is quantified more carefully, making it difficult to lie. As well, most hotel minibars are now equipped with sensors which connect directly with the billing authority, making the honor system unnecessary.\n\nIn the Southern Californian recreational sport fishing industry, the honor system is widely used, particularly on open party fishing boats. When the cook is occupied or in his bunk, passengers are permitted to get drinks and snacks on their own, providing they mark their own galley tab.\n\nMany publicly funded museums and art galleries around the world ask for a certain \"suggested donation\" in exchange for admission. Patrons are almost never supervised during their donations, so there is no way of making sure the suggested minimum is being paid. Strictly speaking this is not an honor system, as no payment obligation actually exists (merely a suggested donation); a true honor system is one in which there is an obligation, but it is not enforced. However, these \"suggested donation\" schemes are often regarded as similar to an honor system, because they rely on the goodwill of patrons rather than the force of law.\n\nNational and State parks and some private parks often use an honor system to collect their admission fees. Rather than having a manned booth, they have a drop box known as an honesty box where money can be inserted, either directly, or in an envelope. Sometimes, the envelope contains a stub that is removed and placed on the guest's vehicle.\n\nA lot of land International borders do not thoroughly check all persons passing the checkpoints for required documents or contraband. When the security threat at the crossing is perceived by the nation's government to be low, checks may be conducted only on random persons or vehicles.\n\nThe first honor system in America was penned by Thomas Jefferson at the College of William and Mary, Jefferson's \"alma mater\". In some colleges, the honor system is used to administer tests unsupervised. Students are generally asked to sign an honor code statement that says they will not cheat or use unauthorized resources when taking the test. As an example, at Vanderbilt University students taking examinations are required to sign and include the following pledge: \"On my honor as a student I have neither given nor received aid on this examination\". Any student caught in violation of the Honor Code is referred to the Honor Council which investigates and determines the appropriate action, which can range from failing the course to expulsion from the University. At the University of Virginia a student taking an examination is also required to sign a pledge not to give or receive aid and there is but one penalty for transgression of the honor code, and that is dismissal from the University. Texas A&M also has an Honor System which states, Aggies do not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do. This is listed at the beginning of all tests. Any student that does not follow the code is remanded to the Honor council so they can determine the severity of the case and how the student should be punished or if expulsion is necessary. The students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also maintain a student-run honor system. Students maintain the integrity of the university by pledging not to cheat, steal or lie. Unlike the University of Virginia, the honor system at Chapel Hill allows for different sanctions, ranging from probation to expulsion. A single-sanction Honor Code exists at the Virginia Military Institute, where a \"drum out\" ceremony is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal.\n\nWashington and Lee University maintains an Honor System that was introduced by General Robert E. Lee, who stated \"We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman.\" The Washington & Lee Honor System is entirely administered through the student body. It is one of the few universities in the United States to have a non-codified system. As a result, students decide what constitutes a breach of honor. These breaches are commonly named as lying, cheating, or stealing, but what constitutes an honor violation is open to the interpretation of the current student body. A single sanction of dismissal is enforced when a student is found guilty of an honor violation.\n\nThe California Institute of Technology implements an honor code that states \"No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.\" Applications of this code range from professors trusting the students not to cheat with unsupervised take-home exams, laptops and bikes left unsecured in the dormitory lounges and courtyards (though the lounges and courtyards are secured against people who are not members of the Caltech community), and the food service trusting the students not to conduct food-hoarding raids during open kitchen hours. The primary enforcement of the Caltech Honor Code is through student-run councils, but a few members of the Caltech faculty are involved.\n\nSome lower security inmates at prisons are granted furloughs and allowed to temporarily leave the boundaries of the penitentiary for various reasons with the expectation they will return voluntarily when due without absconding. The reasons for departure may be for employment, education, recreation, or attending family events (such as weddings or funerals).\n\nAnother example can be seen in fundraising drives. Many charities distribute boxes of confectionery to businesses, which are placed in waiting rooms or similar for people to purchase items from. The confectionery is free to be removed by anyone who wishes to take it, and there is no enforcing of payment other than through the expectation of honesty. Indeed, most such boxes of confectionery bear the comment \"Your honesty is appreciated\" near where money is deposited.\n\nIn many places of worship, those partaking in events with compulsory fees are expected to pay their dues, though most institutions such as these do not enforce payment. There is a general assumption of trust in most religious settings.\n\nSome supermarket chains allow customers to scan their own groceries with handheld barcode readers while placing them in their own carts (see self-checkout). While the system gives customers the ability to place groceries in their bags without paying, and customers can be randomly audited, participating supermarkets have reported that this experimental system has not increased the amount of shoplifting.\n\nMany hardware superstores, including Home Depot, allow customers to place small items, such as screws, into bags, then label the bags along with the exact price and quantity of the item they are purchasing. The system, which can be easily cheated, is contingent upon the honesty of customers, and is labeled in many stores as an \"honor system.\"\n\nIn some countries, farmers leave bags of produce beside the road outside their houses with prices affixed. Passers-by pay by leaving cash in a container. In Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom this is called the honesty box system. In other countries, small unmanned stores are run, where customers are able to enter, obtain what they need, and pay the bill in a secure container.\n\nIn the sport of airsoft, players rely on an honor system to tell whether or not an opponent is hit, because unlike paintballs, airsoft pellets leave no visible markings on clothing.\n\nTwo combat sports practiced by the Society for Creative Anachronism, Armored Combat and Rapier Combat, use an honor system to judge valid strikes. The individual who is hit is responsible for acknowledging if the impact was valid.\n\nDisc ultimate has historically relied on the honor system and encodes it as part of the “Spirit of the Game,” to the point where very few competitions use referees and players are allowed to call fouls on their opponents.\n\nSports that deliberately incorporate alternative sexualities, by necessity, rely on the honor system for enforcement. The National Gay Flag Football League limits heterosexual competition to 20% of a team's roster. Muggle quidditch requires a minimum number of players to be of a second gender, while allowing players to identify as any number of gender identities to qualify under the rule.\n\nIn many places where an honor system is used, it has been found to be cost-effective. Many businesses and organizations using an honor system have determined that the cost of maintaining staff to enforce proper payment outweighs the losses caused by the percentage of the population who are willing to cheat the system. In addition, efficiency is high when an honor system is used. For example, buses/trains do not have to wait to sell or check passenger tickets when boarding and can instead leave immediately, and customs green channels allow for much faster exits than if every passenger is routinely checked.\n\nFor the remainder of the population, the honor system gives a more welcoming feeling to customers. Those who are treated with trust may be more likely to return to the location, and thereby increase the amount of business.\n\nDeciding whether or not to obey an honor system can be a dilemma, especially if one places his/her personal financial self-interest above the interest of the institution they are patronizing. This can lead to a future negative impact towards their personal financial self-interest. Honor systems are often criticized for promoting laziness and bad behavior. Some have suggested it is paradoxical to ask people to obey a law if there is no apparent law.\n\n\n\nThe honor system also uses (Phycology of Deterrence), phycology of deterrence is basically doing right because of the fear of being punished."}

Lingayat teachers from Maharashtra which was started by Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj. It is inspired by Deshastha Brahmin Sant Mat teachers as Dnyaneshwar, Eknath and Samarth Ramdas. The Inchagiri Sampradaya has become well-known throughout the western world due to the popularity of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.\n\nThe mythological origins of the Inchagiri Sampradaya are ascribed to Adiguru Shri Dattatreya. He initiated the Navanaths, the Holy Nine Gurus, and the Navanath Sampraday.\n\nOne of those Navnaths was Revanath, the 7th or 8th Navnath. Revanath settled on the Siddhgiri hill for ascetic practice, living on whatever the jungle, gave him. He became famous as Kaadhsiddheshwar, \"the one who attained supreme realization in a forest\".\n\nRevananath is considered to have established the Kaadsiddheshwar temple and math, also called \"Kaadsiddheshwar Peeth\". in the 7th century CE. Other accounts mention a history of \"more than 1300 years\", and the 14th century CE, when a Lingayat Priest established a Shivling at the hill, which became \"Kaneri Math\", nowadays called \"Siddhagiri Math\", It is located on Siddhagiri hill in Kanheri village, Karveer tehsil, Kolhapur district, Maharashtra state, India.\n\nThe Siddhagiri Math was established around the Moola-Kaadsiddheswar Shiva temple in the Shaiva-Lingayat tradition. It is a vast campus with the central Shiva temple.\n\nIn the 12th century the Math came under the influence of Basaveshwar, who established the Lingayat tradition of south India. It is the main Kuldaivat of the Lingayat Shaiva community, its influence exceeding to most of the districts of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and also to some places in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nPart of Siddhagiri Math is the \"Siddhagiri Gramjivan Museum\", a wax museum dedicated to Gandhi's ideal of rural life. It was established by the 27th Mathadhipati, H.H. Adrushya Kadsiddheshwar Swami Ji.\n\nRevanath initiated Sant Dnyaneshwar. (1275–1296), also known as Sant Jñāneshwar or Jñanadeva and as Kadasiddha or Kad-Siddheshwar Maharaj.\n\nDnyaneshwar was a 13th-century Maharashtrian Hindu saint (\"Sant\" - a title by which he is often referred), poet, philosopher and yogi of the Nath tradition whose works \"Bhavartha Deepika\" (a commentary on Bhagavad Gita, popularly known as \"Dnyaneshwari\"), and Amrutanubhav are considered to be milestones in Marathi literature.\n\nAccording to Shirvaikar, Dnyaneshwar was initiated into the Nath by his older brother Nivrutti, who was born in 1273. \nIn 1287 Nivrutti initiated his younger brother:\nDnyaneshwar died at the young age of 21.\n\nDifferent accounts of the founding of the Nimbargi Sampradaya by Nimbargi Maharaj, the alternate name of the Inchegeri Sampradaya, are to be found.\n\nNimbargi belonged to a Nellawai sub-caste of the Lingayat caste. According to Boucher,\nNimbargi practiced for 36 years, meanwhile living as a householder, and was finally awakened when he was 67. Until his death, at the age of 95, he \"initiated people and lived the life of a Jivanmukta\".\n\nAccording to Kotnis, Bhausaheb Maharj was looked upon as the reincarnation of Sant Tukaram (1577–1650), a prominent Varkari Sant and spiritual poet of the Bhakti, who had taken birth again in the Neelwani Lingayat community to finish his work of spreading the knowledge of Self-realization. Bhausaheb Maharaj belonged to the Deshastha Brahmin caste. the same caste to which the thirteenth century Varkari saint and philosopher Dnyaneshwar belonged, the 16th century sant Eknath, and the 17th century saint and spiritual poet Samarth Ramdas.\n\nAt the request of Nimbargi, Bhausaheb Maharaj Deshpande (1843 Umdi – 1914 Inchgiri) received mantra initiation from Shri Raghunathpriya Sadhu Maharaj, who was an ardent follower and a devoted disciple of Shri Gurulingajangam Maharaj. Bhausaheb Maharaj became a disciple of Nimbargi Maharaj.\n\nBhausaheb Maharaj teachings were collected in a book called \"Nama-Yoga\", a term coined by the compilers and translators of the book, whereas Bhausaheb Maharaj himself called it Jnana Marga, just like Nimbargi Maharaj did. Bhausaheb Maharaj's teachings, and those of his student Gurudeo Ranade, have been called \"Pipilika Marg \", \"the Ant's way\", the way of meditation, while the teachings of Siddharameshwar Maharaj and his disciples Nisargadatta Maharaj and Ranjit Maharaj have been called \"Vihangam Marg\", \"the Bird's Way\", the direct path to Self-discovery.\n\nAfter his awakening he was authorized by Nimbargi to carry on the lineage, and established the Inchegeri Sampraday. Sri Bhausaheb Maharaj had many students, among which were:\n\nRamachandra Dattatreya Ranade (1886–1957) was a scholar with an academic career. He taught at Willindon College, Sangli, on a regular basis before being invited to join Allahabad University as Head of Department of Philosophy where he rose to be the Vice-Chancellor. After retirement in 1946 he lived in an ashrama in a small village, Nimbal, near Solapur where he died on 6 June 1957.\n\nSiddharameshwar Maharaj was born in 1888. In 1906 he was initiated by his guru Bhausaheb Maharaj in Inchegeri in Karnataka India, who taught mantra-meditation as the way to reach Final Reality. In 1920 Siddharameshwar Maharaj started to set out on \"the Bird's Path\", the fast way to attain realisation, six years after Bhauhaseb maharaj had died. His fellow-students opposed, but eventually he succeeded by himself.\n\nSri Siddharameshwar Maharaj initiated several well-known teachers:\n\nSiddharameshwar Maharaje used four books to give sermons on: Dasbodh of Saint Shri Samarth Ramdas; the Yoga Vasistha; \"Sadachara\" of Shri Shankaracharya; and the \"Eknathi Bhagwat\" of Sant Eknath.\n\nNisargadatta started to give initiations in 1951, after a personal revelation from his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj:\nNisargadatta Maharaj attracted a broad following in the western world. He never appointed any successor, because \nOnly a few persons were acknowledged as \"jnani\" by Sri Nisargadatta. Nevertheless, several western teachers regard Sri Nisargadatta to be their guru. Shri Ramakant Maharaj says to be \"the only Indian direct disciple of Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj\" who offers initiation into this lineage. He received the Naam mantra in 1962 from Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj, and spent the next 19 years with him.\n\nSri Ranjit Maharaj (1913–2000) met Siddharameshwar Maharaj in 1924. The following year he was initiated by Siddharameshwar Maharaj. In 1934, at the age of 24, he took initiation to monkhood. Only in 1983, at the age of 70, initiated his first disciple, Shri Siddharameshwar Maharajs granddaughter in law.\n\nShri Samartha Sadaguru Ganapatrao Maharaj Kannur (1909–2004) was initiated by Siddharameshwar Maharaj when he was thirteen. After graduation he attained liberation at age 24. Later in life he founded the Shanti Kuteer Ashram.\n\nShri Muppin Kaadsiddheshwar Maharaj was formally adopted by the 25th Virupaksha Kaadeshwar of the Kaneri Math, Lingayat Parampara, and invested as the 26th Mathadheepati of the (Siddhagiri) Kaneri Math, Lingayat Parampara, in 1922 at the age of 17. He met Siddharameshwar Maharaj in 1935, who became his guru.\n\nNisargadatta narrates the following about the succession of teachers of the Inchagiri Sampradaya:\nNisargadatta also told:\nNisargadatta also explained:\nNisargadatta further explains:\nNisargadatta started to give initiations in 1951, after a \"personal revelation\" from his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj, while Ranjit Maharaj started to give initiations in 1983, almost half a century after his awakening, on request of Siddharameshwar Maharaj granddaughter-in-law:\n\n\nGeneral\nHomepages\n"}

His work \"The Secret of Hegel\" (1st edition, 1865, in 2 vols.; revised edition, 1898, in 1 vol.) gave great impetus to the study of Hegelian philosophy both in Britain and in the United States, and it was also accepted as an authoritative work on Hegel's philosophy in Germany and Italy.\n\nJames Hutchison Stirling was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the 5th son (and the youngest of 6 children) of William Stirling (died 14 March 1851) and Elizabeth Christie (d. 1828). William was a wealthy textile manufacturer who was a partner in the Glasgow firm of James Hutchison & Co., which manufactured muslin (lightweight cotton cloth in a plain weave, used for making sheets and for a variety of other purposes). William was known for his deeply-held religious views, many of which strongly influenced his son James.\n\nStirling studied at Young's Academy in Glasgow, followed by 9 years of education (1833-1842) at the University of Glasgow, where he studied medicine, history, and classics. He became a Licentiate (1842, medical diploma) and Fellow (1860) of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.\n\nStirling married Jane Hunter Mair (died 5 July 1903), an old family friend, on 28 April 1847 in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The couple had seven children (5 daughters and 2 sons), as follows: Jessie Jane Stirling (born 26 June 1850) (who married Rev. Robert Armstrong of Glasgow), Elizabeth Margaret Stirling (11 February 1852 - 1871), Amelia Hutchison Stirling, Florence Hutchison Stirling (1858 - 6 May 1948), Lucy Stirling, William Stirling, and David Stirling. Stirling's daughter Amelia wrote many books on historical subjects, and she was the joint-translator - with William Hale White (1831-1913) - of Spinoza's \"Ethics\" (1883). She also wrote a biography of her father James titled \"James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work\" (London and Leipzig: T. Fisher Unwin, 1912). Stirling's daughter Florence won the Scottish Ladies' Championship (a chess championship) 5 times (in 1905, 1906, 1907, 1912, and 1913).\n\nAfter receiving a large inheritance from his father's estate in 1851, Stirling left his medical practice. He then set out to learn French and German, for the purpose of being able to better understand continental philosophical trends. In pursuit of this goal, he moved his family briefly to Boulogne-sur-Mer, France (located in the current Pas-de-Calais department of the Hauts-de-France region), then to Paris for 18 months, then to St. Servan (located 2 miles from the ferry port of St. Malo in the Ille-et-Vilaine department of the Brittany region of France) for four and a half years, and then finally to Heidelberg, Germany. In November 1857, Stirling and his family took up residence in London (at 3 Wilton Terrace, Kensington), where they lived for about 3 years. After this, in 1860 Stirling returned to Edinburgh - his address there was 4 Laverock Bank Road, Trinity, Edinburgh - which then became his permanent residence until the end of his life, and where he wrote on the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) and many other subjects. The primary result of his comprehensive Hegel studies was his influential work \"The Secret of Hegel\" (2 vols., 1865).\n\nOne of Stirling's other major philosophical works - \"Philosophy and Theology\" (1890) (consisting of his 20 Gifford Lectures, delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 1889-1890) - focuses not on Hegelian philosophical topics, but on Charles Darwin's evolutionary theories.\n\nFrederick Copleston (\"A History of Philosophy\" vol. VII, p. 12) wrote \"...we may be inclined to smile at J. H. Stirling's picture of Hegel as the great champion of Christianity.\"\n\nIn his final years he lived at 4 Laverockbank Road in Trinity, Edinburgh.\n\nStirling died in Edinburgh. He is buried in Warriston Cemetery on the north side of the city. His grave lies in the centre of the long, upper section north of the vaults, facing south onto an east-west path.\n\nOther works: \n\nMore concerned with literature:\n\n\n"}

As an adult he moved to England, and became a British subject. His most famous work was \"\" (\"The Constitution of England\", 1771), which was subsequently published in English as well. In it, de Lolme advocated a constitutional form of government enshrining the principle that monarchy, aristocracy and democracy should be balanced against each other. He also praised the element of representative democracy in the constitution, and urged an extension of suffrage. The work influenced many of the framers of the United States Constitution.\n\nDe Lolme was born in the then independent Republic of Geneva in 1740. He studied for the bar, and had begun to practise law when he was obliged to emigrate on account of a pamphlet he wrote entitled \"Examen de trois parts de droit\" (\"Examination of Three Parts of Rights\"), which gave offence to the authorities of the town. He took refuge in England, where he lived for several years on the meagre and precarious income derived from occasional contributions to various journals.\n\nDuring his protracted exile in England, De Lolme made a careful study of the English constitution, the results of which he published in his \"\" (\"The Constitution of England\", Amsterdam, 1771), of which an enlarged and improved edition in English appeared in 1775, and was several times reprinted. The work excited much interest as containing many acute observations on the causes of the excellence of the English constitution as compared with those of other countries. However, it was termed by the 11th edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" (1911) as \"wanting in breadth of view, being written before the period when constitutional questions were treated in a scientific manner\".\n\nIn the book, de Lolme advocated a constitutional form of government enshrining the principle of balanced government, balancing the one, the few, and the many, or the ideas of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He criticised the power of the British parliament and made a grotesque expression which became proverbial: \"parliament can do everything but make a woman a man and a man a woman\". Nonetheless, de Lolme extolled the British government because, in his view, which was influenced by his own observations and study as well as by the previous writings of Voltaire and Montesquieu, the unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom embodied the ideal of balanced government better than any other government of the time. In particular, he praised the element of representative democracy in the constitution, and urged an extension of suffrage. De Lolme developed and refined his political thinking to a large extent in opposition to the more radical theory of direct democracy advocated by his compatriot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whom he accused of being unrealistic. De Lolme is sometimes identified as a probable candidate for being the person behind the pseudonymous political commentator Junius.\n\nDe Lolme also wrote in English \"A Parallel between the English Government and the Former Government of Sweden\" (1772); \"The History of the Flagellants\" (c. 1776), based upon a work by Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux; \"An Essay, Containing a Few Strictures on the Union of Scotland with England\" (1787); and one or two smaller works.\n\nIn 1775, de Lolme found himself compelled to accept aid from a charitable society to enable him to return home. He died at Seewen, a village in the Canton of Schwyz, on 16 July 1806.\n\nDe Lolme's \"Constitution de l'Angleterre\", along with a translation of David Hume's \"History of England\" (1754–1761), supplied philosophers of the time with most of their ideas about the English constitution. It was therefore used somewhat as a political pamphlet. The work influenced many of the framers of the United States Constitution. One Founding Father who was not present in Philadelphia, but whose \"Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States\" (1787) influenced the delegates there, was John Adams, who praised De Lolme's book as one of the best on the subject of constitutionalism ever written. Some have argued that De Lolme's work also influenced the Constitution of Norway.\n\n"}
{"id": "3261530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3261530", "title": "Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions", "text": "Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible prohibits ingesting blood and that Christians should not accept blood transfusions or donate or store their own blood for transfusion. The belief is based on an interpretation of scripture that differs from that of other Christian denominations. It is one of the doctrines for which Jehovah's Witnesses are best known.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses' literature teaches that their refusal of transfusions of whole blood or its four primary components—red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma—is a non-negotiable religious stand and that those who respect life as a gift from God do not try to sustain life by taking in blood, even in an emergency. Witnesses are taught that the use of fractions such as albumin, immunoglobulins and hemophiliac preparations are \"not absolutely prohibited\", and are instead a matter of personal choice.\n\nThe doctrine was introduced in 1945, and has undergone some changes since then. Members of the group who voluntarily accept a transfusion and are not deemed repentant are regarded as having disassociated themselves from the group by abandoning its doctrines and are subsequently shunned by members of the organization. Although accepted by the majority of Jehovah's Witnesses, a minority does not endorse this doctrine.\n\nThe Watch Tower Society has established Hospital Information Services to provide education and facilitate bloodless surgery. This service also maintains Hospital Liaison Committees, whose function is to provide support to adherents.\n\nOn the basis of various biblical texts, including , , and , Jehovah's Witnesses believe:\n\nCertain medical procedures involving blood are specifically prohibited by Jehovah's Witnesses' blood doctrine. This includes the use of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and blood plasma. Other fractions derived from blood are not prohibited. Watch Tower publications state that some products derived from one of the four primary components may be so similar to the function of the whole component and carry on such a life-sustaining role in the body that \"most Christians would find them objectionable\". For procedures where there is no specific doctrinal prohibition, individuals are to obtain details from medical personnel and then make a personal decision.\n\nThe following medical procedures are prohibited:\n\nThe following procedures and products are not prohibited, and are left to the decision of individual members:\n\nA variety of bloodless surgical techniques have been developed for use on patients who refuse blood transfusions for reasons that include concern about AIDS, hepatitis, and other blood-borne infections, or immune system reactions. Many physicians have expressed a willingness to respect patients' preferences and provide bloodless treatment and about 200 hospitals offer bloodless medicine and surgery programs for patients who wish to avoid or limit blood transfusions. Bloodless surgery has been successfully performed in significant procedures including open-heart surgery and total hip replacements. A 2012 study in \"JAMA Internal Medicine\" concluded that \"Witnesses do not appear to be at increased risk for surgical complications or long-term mortality when comparisons are properly made by transfusion status. Thus, current extreme blood management strategies do not appear to place patients at heightened risk for reduced long-term survival.\" The study also stated that \"Survival estimates of Witnesses were 86%, 69%, 51%, and 34% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after surgery, respectively, vs 74%, 53%, 35%, and 23% among non-Witnesses who received transfusions.\"\n\nBloodless medical and surgical techniques have limitations, and surgeons say the use of various allogeneic blood products and pre-operative autologous blood transfusion are appropriate standards of care for certain patient presentations. The Watch Tower Society states that in medical emergencies where blood transfusions seem to be the only available way to save a life, Jehovah's Witnesses request that doctors provide the best alternative care possible under the circumstances with respect for their personal conviction. The Watch Tower Society has acknowledged that some members have died after refusing blood.\n\nIn some countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, a parent or guardian's decision can be legally overruled by medical staff. In this case, medical staff may act without consent, by obtaining a court order in a non-emergency situation, or without such in an emergency. In Japan, a doctor must respect the wish of an adult but can override the wishes of a child and their parents if the child is under 15. If a child is aged 15 to 17, a doctor will not perform a transfusion if the parents and the child refuse the transfusion. If a child aged from 15 to 17 objects to a transfusion but the parents demand the transfusion, then a doctor can override the child's wish. In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that in cases of \"an imminent threat to a child's life\", physicians in some cases may \"intervene over parental objections\".\n\nIn 1988, the Watch Tower Society formed \"Hospital Information Services\", a department to help locate doctors or surgical teams who are willing to perform medical procedures on Witnesses without blood transfusions. The department was given oversight of each branch office's \"Hospital Information Desk\", and of one hundred \"Hospital Liaison Committees\" established throughout the United States. As of 2003, about 200 hospitals worldwide provide bloodless medical programs. As of 2006, there are 1,535 Hospital Liaison Committees worldwide coordinating communication between 110,000 physicians.\n\nHospital Information Services researches medical journals to locate information on the availability and effectiveness of bloodless surgery methods. It disseminates information about treatment options to local Hospital Liaison Committees, and to doctors and hospitals.\n\nAnnually since 2004, Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States have been informed that \"with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission [to hospital] and provide spiritual encouragement\", but that \"elders serving on a \"Patient Visitation Group\" [could] have access to your name\" only if patients made their wishes known according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\nJehovah's Witnesses' branch offices communicate directly with congregations regarding \"ways to benefit from the activities of the Hospital Liaison Committee (HLC) and the Patient Visitation Group (PVG).\" A Jehovah's Witnesses publication in 2000 reported that Argentina had fewer than a hundred HLC committeemen \"giving vital information to the medical community\", adding that \"their work is complemented by hundreds of other self-sacrificing elders who make up Patient Visitation Groups that call on Witness patients to help and encourage them\". Each branch office appoints PVG committeemen, who serve as volunteers.\n\nSince the elaboration of the blood doctrine to the point of prohibiting transfusion, the majority of Jehovah's Witnesses have adopted the organization's position. Those Jehovah's Witnesses who accept the blood doctrine typically hold strongly to their conviction. In the August 1998 issue of \"Academic Emergency Medicine\", Donald Ridley, a Jehovah's Witness and organization staff attorney, argued that carrying an up-to-date Medical Directive card issued by the organization indicates that an individual personally agrees with the established religious position of Jehovah's Witness.\n\nIn 1958, \"The Watchtower\" reported on a particular member of Jehovah's Witnesses who voluntarily accepted blood transfusion, contrary to Watchtower doctrine. The organization confirms that members have accepted blood transfusions, despite the imposition in 1961 of a communal shunning policy for willful acceptance.\n\nIn 1982, a peer-reviewed case study of a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses was undertaken by Drs. Larry J. Findley and Paul M. Redstone to evaluate individual belief in respect to blood among Jehovah's Witnesses. The study showed that 12% were willing to accept transfusion therapy forbidden by Jehovah's Witness doctrine. One peer-reviewed study examining medical records indicated a similar percentage of Jehovah's Witnesses willing to accept blood transfusions for their children. Young adults also showed a willingness to accept blood transfusions. In another study, Jehovah's Witness patients presented for labor and delivery showed a willingness to accept some form of blood or blood products. Of these patients, 10 percent accepted whole blood transfusion.\n\nWatch Tower publications have noted that within religions, the personal beliefs of members often differ from official doctrine. Regarding Jehovah's Witnesses acceptance of the organization's official position on blood, Drs Cynthia Gyamfi and Richard Berkowitz state, \"It is naïve to assume that all people in any religious group share the exact same beliefs, regardless of doctrine. It is well known that Muslims, Jews and Christians have significant individual variations in their beliefs. Why should that not also be true of Jehovah's Witnesses?\"\n\nAmbivalence and rejection of the blood doctrine dates back to at least the 1940s. After the Watch Tower Society established the doctrine, teaching that blood should not be eaten (circa 1927-31), Margaret Buber, who was never a member of the denomination, offered a firsthand eyewitness account of Jehovah's Witnesses in the Nazi Ravensbrück concentration camp. She relates that an overwhelming majority were willing to eat blood sausage despite having alternate food to choose from, and specifically after considering biblical statements regarding blood.\n\nFrom 1931, when the name \"Jehovah's witnesses\" was adopted, Watch Tower Society publications maintained the view of Society founder Charles Taze Russell that the reference to abstaining from the eating of blood in the Apostolic Decree of Acts 15:19–29 was a \"suggestion\" to be given to Gentile converts. Watch Tower publications during the presidency of Joseph Franklin Rutherford commended the commercial and emergency uses of blood. A 1925 issue of \"The Golden Age\" commended a man for donating blood 45 times without payment. In 1927, \"The Watchtower\" noted, without elaboration, that in Genesis 9, God decreed that Noah and his offspring \"must not eat the blood, because the life is in the blood\". In 1940 \"Consolation\" magazine reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.\n\nIn 1944, with the Watch Tower Society under the administration of president Nathan Homer Knorr, \"The Watchtower\" asserted that the decrees contained in Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 17:10–14 forbade the eating or drinking of blood in biblical times \"whether by transfusion or by the mouth\" and that this applied \"in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as 'Jonadabs' of the Lord's 'other sheep'.\"\n\nIn September 1945, representatives of the Watch Tower Society in the Netherlands commented on blood transfusion in the Dutch edition of \"Consolation\". A translation of their comments into English reads: According to sociologist Richard Singelenbreg, the statement appearing in the Dutch edition of \"Consolation\" may have been published without knowledge of the doctrinal position published in the English July 1945 issue of \"Consolation\" by the Watch Tower Society's headquarters in the United States.\n\nIn 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous. The prohibition did not specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, but by January 1961—in what was later described as an application of \"increased strictness\"—it was ruled that it was a disfellowshipping offense to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion. Watch Tower publications warned that accepting a blood transfusion could prevent Witnesses from living eternally in God's new world, the hope held by members: \"It may result in the immediate and very temporary prolongation of life, but that at the cost of eternal life for a dedicated Christian.\"\n\nIn September 1956, \"Awake!\" stated, \"certain blood fractions ... also come under the Scriptural ban\". A position against \"the various blood fractions\" was reiterated in September 1961. In November of the same year, the doctrine was modified to allow individual members to decide whether they could conscientiously accept fractions used from blood for purposes such as vaccination. This position has been expanded on since; the pre-formatted Durable Power of Attorney form provided by the Watch Tower Society includes an option for Jehovah's Witnesses to \"accept all fractions derived from any primary component of blood.\"\n\nIn 1964, Jehovah's Witnesses were prohibited from obtaining transfusions for pets, from using fertilizer containing blood, and were even advised (if their conscience troubled them) to write to dog food manufacturers to verify that their products were blood-free. Later that year, it was stated that doctors or nurses who are Jehovah's Witness would not administer blood transfusions to fellow dedicated members. As to administering transfusions to non-members, \"The Watchtower\" stated that such a decision is \"left to the Christian doctor's own conscience.\"\n\nIn 1982, a \"Watchtower\" article declared that it would be wrong for a Witness to allow a leech to feed on his/her blood as part of a medical procedure, due to the sacredness of blood.\n\nIn 1989 \"The Watchtower\" stated, \"Each individual must decide\" whether to accept hemodilution and autologous blood salvage (cell saver) procedures. In 1990, a brochure entitled \"How Can Blood Save Your Life?\" was released, outlining Jehovah's Witnesses' general doctrine on blood.\n\nIn 2000, the Watch Tower Society's stand on blood fractions was clearly stated. Members were instructed to personally decide if accepting a fraction would violate the doctrine on blood. In a later article, members were reminded that Jehovah's Witnesses do not donate blood or store their own blood prior to surgery.\n\nIn May 2001, the Watch Tower Society revised its medical directives and identity cards addressing its doctrinal position on blood; the revised materials were distributed from May 3, 2001. These revised documents specified that \"allogeneic blood transfusions\" were unacceptable whereas the former document (dated 1999) stated that \"blood transfusions\" were unacceptable. The revised 2001 documents were active until December 20, 2001. The Watch Tower Society then rescinded the revised document, stating, \"After further review, it has been determined that the cards dated \"md-E 6/01\" and \"ic-E 6/01\" should not be used. Please destroy these items and make sure that they are not distributed to the publishers.\" Elders were instructed to revert to the older 1999 edition of the medical directives and identity cards.\n\nWatch Tower Society publications frequently claim negative consequences of blood transfusions:\n\nOpposition to the Watch Tower doctrines on blood transfusions has come from both members and non-members. A group of dissident Witnesses known as Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood (AJWRB) states that there is no biblical basis for the prohibition of blood transfusions and seeks to have some policies changed. In a series of articles in the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\" US neurologist Osamu Muramoto, who is a medical adviser to the AJWRB, has raised issues including what he claims is coercion to refuse transfusions, doctrinal inconsistency, selective use of information by the Watch Tower Society to exaggerate the dangers of transfusions and the use of outdated medical beliefs.\n\nDissident Witnesses say the Society's use of Leviticus 17:12 to support its opposition to blood transfusions conflicts with its own teachings that Christians are not under the Mosaic law. Theologian Anthony Hoekema claims the blood prohibited in Levitical laws was not human, but animal. He cites other authors who support his view that the direction at Acts 15 to abstain from blood was intended not as an everlasting covenant but a means of maintaining a peaceful relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians. He has described as \"absurd literalism\" the Witnesses' use of a scriptural prohibition on eating blood to prohibit the medical transfusion of human blood.\n\nOsamu Muramoto has argued that the refusal by Jehovah's Witnesses of \"life-saving\" blood treatment creates serious bio-medical ethical issues. He has criticized the \"controlling intervention\" of the Watch Tower Society by means of what he claims is information control and its policy of penalising members who accept blood transfusions or advocate freedom to choose blood-based treatment. He says the threat of being classified as a disassociated Witness and subsequently shunned by friends and relatives who are members coerces Jehovah's Witnesses to accept and obey the prohibition on blood transfusions. In one particular case involving a Russian district court decision, however, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found nothing in the judgments to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. It noted: \"On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation.\" The court said: \"The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others.\"\n\nMuramoto has claimed the intervention of Hospital Liaison Committees can add to \"organisational pressure\" applied by family members, friends and congregation members on Witness patients to refuse blood-based treatment. He notes that while HLC members, who are church elders, \"may give the patient 'moral support', the influence of their presence on the patient is known to be tremendous. Case reports reveal JW patients have changed their earlier decision to accept blood treatment after a visit from the elders.\" He claims such organizational pressure compromises the autonomy of Witness patients and interferes with their privacy and confidentiality. He has advocated a policy in which the Watch Tower organization and congregation elders would not question patients on the details of their medical care and patients would not disclose such information. He says the Society adopted such a policy in 1983 regarding details of sexual activity between married couples.\n\nWatch Tower spokesman Donald T. Ridley says neither elders nor HLC members are instructed or encouraged to probe into the health care decisions of Witness patients and do not involve themselves in patient hospitalisations unless patients request their assistance. Yet Watchtower HLC representative David Malyon says he would respond to \"sin\" of Witnesses he is privy to by effectively saying \"Are you going to tell them or shall I!\" Nevertheless Ridley says Muramoto's suggestion that Witnesses should be free to disregard Watch Tower scriptural teachings and standards is preposterous. He says loving God means obeying commandments, not disobeying them and hiding one's disobedience from others.\n\nMuramoto recommends doctors have a private meeting with patients to discuss their wishes, and that church elders and family members not be present, enabling patients to feel free of church pressure. He suggests doctors question patients on (a) whether they have considered that the Watch Tower Society might soon approve some medical practices they currently find objectionable, in the same manner that it has previously abandoned its opposition to vaccination and organ transplants; (b) whether Witness patients know which blood components are allowed and which are prohibited, and whether they acknowledge that those rulings are organizational policy rather than biblical teachings; and (c) whether they realize that although some Bible scriptures proscribe the eating of blood, eating and transfusing blood have entirely different effects on the body. English HLC representative David Malyon has responded that Muramoto's suggested questions are an affront to coerce Jehovah's Witnesses with \"complicated philosophical inquisition\" and, if used by doctors, would be \"an abusive transformation of the medical role of succour and care into that of devil's advocate and trickster\".\n\nMuramoto has claimed many Watch Tower Society publications employ exaggeration and emotionalism to emphasize the dangers of transfusions and the advantages of alternative treatments, but present a distorted picture by failing to report any benefits of blood-based treatment. Nor do its publications acknowledge that in some situations, including rapid and massive haemorrhage, there are no alternatives to blood transfusions. He claims Watch Tower Society publications often discuss the risk of death as a result of refusing blood transfusions, but give little consideration to the prolonged suffering and disability, producing an added burden on family and society, that can result from refusal. Attorney and former Witness Kerry Louderback-Wood also claims that Witness publications exaggerate the medical risks of taking blood and the efficiency of non-blood medical therapies in critical situations.\n\nDouglas E. Cowan, an academic in the sociology of religion, has claimed that members of the Christian countercult movement who criticize the Watch Tower Society, make selective use of information themselves. For example, Christian apologist Richard Abanes wrote that their ban on blood transfusions, \"has led to countless Witness deaths over the years, including many children.\" Cowan wrote: \"When the careful reader checks [Abanes' footnote], however, looking perhaps for some statistical substantiation, he or she finds only a statistical conjecture based on 1980 Red Cross blood use figures.\" Cowan also says Abanes omits \"critical issues\" in an attempt to \"present the most negative face possible.\" Cowan wrote that \"the reader is left with the impression that the Watchtower Society knowingly presides over a substantial number of preventable deaths each year.\"\n\nOsamu Muramoto says the Watch Tower Society relies on discarded, centuries-old medical beliefs to support its assertion that blood transfusions are the same as eating blood. A 1990 Watch Tower brochure on blood quoted a 17th-century anatomist to support its view. Muramoto says the view that blood is nourishment—still espoused in Watch Tower publications—was abandoned by modern medicine many decades ago. He has criticized an analogy commonly used by the Society in which it states: \"Consider a man who is told by the doctor that he must abstain from alcohol. Would he be obedient if he quit drinking alcohol but had it put directly into his veins?\" Muramoto says the analogy is false, explaining: \"Orally ingested alcohol is absorbed as alcohol and circulated as such in the blood, whereas orally eaten blood is digested and does not enter the circulation as blood. Blood introduced directly into the veins circulates and functions as blood, not as nutrition. Hence, blood transfusion is a form of cellular organ transplantation. And ... organ transplants are now permitted by the WTS.\" He says the objection to blood transfusions on the basis of biblical proscriptions against eating blood is similar to the refusal of a heart transplant on the basis that a doctor warned a patient to abstain from eating meat because of his high cholesterol level.\n\nDavid Malyon, chairman of the English Hospital Liaison Committee in Luton, England, has claimed that Muramoto's discussion of the differences between consuming blood and alcohol is pedantic and says blood laws in the Bible are based upon the reverence for life and its association with blood, and that laws should be kept in the spirit as much as in the letter.\n\nMuramoto has described as peculiar and inconsistent the Watch Tower policy of acceptance of all the individual components of blood plasma as long as they are not taken at the same time. He says the Society offers no biblical explanation for differentiating between prohibited treatments and those considered a \"matter of conscience\", explaining the distinction is based entirely on arbitrary decisions of the Governing Body, to which Witnesses must adhere strictly on the premise of them being Bible-based \"truth\". He has questioned why white blood cells (1 per cent of blood volume) and platelets (0.17 per cent) are forbidden, yet albumin (2.2 per cent of blood volume) is permitted. He has questioned why donating blood and storing blood for autologous transfusion is deemed wrong, but the Watch Tower Society permits the use of blood components that must be donated and stored before Witnesses use them. He has questioned why Witnesses, although viewing blood as sacred and symbolizing life, are prepared to let a person die by placing more importance on the symbol than the reality it symbolizes.\n\nKerry Louderback-Wood alleges that by labeling the currently acceptable blood fractions as \"minute\" in relation to whole blood, the Watch Tower organization causes followers to misunderstand the scope and extent of allowed fractions.\n\nWitnesses respond that the real issue is not of the fluid \"per se\", but of respect and obedience to God. They say their principle of abstaining from blood as a display of respect is demonstrated by the fact that members are allowed to eat meat that still contains some blood. As soon as blood is drained from an animal, the \"respect\" has been shown to God, and then a person can eat the meat even though it may contain a small amount of blood. Jehovah's Witnesses' view of meat and blood is different from that of kosher Jewish adherents, who go to great lengths to remove minor traces of blood.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "206938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206938", "title": "Johan Vilhelm Snellman", "text": "Johan Vilhelm Snellman\n\nJohan Vilhelm Snellman (; 12 May 1806, Stockholm – 4 July 1881, Kirkkonummi) was an influential Fennoman philosopher and Finnish statesman, ennobled in 1866.\n\nSnellman was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of Kristian Henrik Snellman, a ship's captain. After the Russian conquest of Finland in 1808–09, and the promising establishment of the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, his family moved there in 1813, to the Ostrobothnian coastal town of Kokkola, where his mother Maria Magdalena Snellman died only a year later.\n\nIn 1835, after academic work amongst followers of Hegel, Snellman was appointed lecturer at the University of Helsinki, where he belonged to the famous circle of Cygnaeus, Lönnrot, and Runeberg comprising the brightest of their generation. Snellman's lectures quickly became popular with the students, but in November 1838 his lectureship was temporarily recalled after a judicial proceeding that ultimately aimed to establish firm governmental control of new and oppositional thought among the academics.\n\nAs a consequence Snellman exiled himself to Sweden and Germany, more or less voluntarily, from 1839 to 1842. By the time he returned to Helsinki, his popularity had increased further, but the political juncture did not allow the university to employ him. Instead, he took up the position as headmaster for a school in distant Kuopio and published starkly polemical periodicals, including the paper \"Saima\" in Swedish, which advocated the duty of the educated classes to take up the language of the then circa 85% majority of Finns, and develop Finnish into a language of the civilized world, useful for academic works, fine arts, state craft, and nation building.\n\n\"Saima\" was suppressed by the government in 1846. In 1848–49, Snellman was again rebuffed when applying for the position of professor at Finland's University in Helsinki. After having contemplated a renewed exile in Sweden, this time possibly definitive, Snellman in 1850 gave up the position in Kuopio and moved to Helsinki, where he and his family lived under economically awkward conditions until the death of Emperor Nicholas in 1855, when it again became possible for Snellman to publish periodical papers on political issues.\n\nIn 1856, Snellman was finally appointed professor, which was met with great satisfaction among politically interested Finns. However, Snellman's unparalleled popularity could not remain. He was a generation older than the most active political opposition, and now a man of the government who had the brightest expectations for Finland under the rule of Emperor Alexander II. The language strife in Finland, which he was the chief initiator of, contributed also to substantial opposition against him and his views, and finally not the least his stance against the Polish rebels of the January Uprising of 1863 was seen by many as the ultimate sign of unprincipled ingratiation.\n\nIn 1863 Snellman was called to a cabinet post in the Senate of Finland, in effect as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he became an energetic and valued senator, accomplishing a \"language decree\" from the Emperor that would gradually give Finnish a position equal to that of Swedish within the Finnish government, and thereby practically in Finland at large, the re-establishment of the Parliament, which had remained inhibited since the Russian conquest. \n\nSeparate Finnish currency, the Markka, was introduced in 1860, and Snellman managed to tie it to silver instead of to the ruble. The Markka came to be of the utmost value for Finland.

He is particularly noted for his foundational contributions to the field of textual criticism.\n\nLachmann was born in Brunswick, in present-day Lower Saxony. He studied at Leipzig and Göttingen, devoting himself mainly to philological studies. In Göttingen, he founded a critical and philological society in 1811, in conjunction with Dissen, Schulze, and Bunsen. In 1815, he joined the Prussian army as a volunteer \"chasseur\" and accompanied his detachment to Paris, but did not see active service. In 1816, he became an assistant master in the Friedrichswerder gymnasium at Berlin, and a \"Privatdozent\" at the university. The same summer he became one of the principal masters in the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of Königsberg, where he assisted his colleague, the Germanist Friedrich Karl Köpke, with his edition of Rudolf von Ems' \"Barlaam und Josaphat\" (1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition of the works of Walther von der Vogelweide.\n\nIn January 1818, he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in the University of Königsberg, and at the same time began to lecture on Old German grammar and the Middle High German poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years to an extraordinarily detailed study of those subjects, and in 1824, obtained a leave of absence in order to search the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.\n\nIn 1825, Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor of classical and German philology at the Humboldt University, Berlin (ordinary professor 1827); in 1830, he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences. He died in Berlin.\n\nLachmann is a figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology.\n\nEarly in his career, Lachmann translated the first volume of P.E. Müller's \"Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums\" (1816). In his \"\"Habilitationsschrift\" über die ursprungliche Gestalt des Gedichts von der Nibelungen Noth\" (1816), and in his review of Hagen's \"Nibelungen\" and Benecke's \"Bonerius\", contributed in 1817 to the \"Jenaische Literaturzeitung\", he had already laid down the rules of textual criticism and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct advance in that branch of investigation.\n\nThe rigidly scientific character of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the \"Auswahl aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts\" (1820); in the edition of Hartmann's \"Iwein\" (1827); in those of Walther von der Vogelweide (1827) and Wolfram von Eschenbach (1833); in the papers \"\"Über das Hildebrandslied\",\" \"\"Über althochdeutsche Betonung und Verskunst\",\" \"\"Über den Eingang des Parzivals\",\" and \"Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte\" published in the \"Abhandlungen\" of the Berlin Academy; and in \"Der Nibelunge Not und die Klage\" (1826), which was followed by a critical commentary in 1836.\n\nLachmann's \"Betrachtungen über Homer's Iliad\", first published in the \"Abhandlungen\" of the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the \"Iliad\" consists of eighteen independent \"layers\" variously enlarged and interpolated, had considerable influence on 19th century Homeric scholarship, although his views are no longer accepted.\n\nHis smaller edition of the New Testament appeared in 1831, the 3rd edition in 1846, and the larger second edition, in two volumes, between 1842 and 1850. The plan of Lachmann's edition, which he explained in his \"Studia Krit.\" of 1830, is a modification of the unaccomplished project of Richard Bentley. Lachmann was the first major editor to break from the Textus Receptus, seeking to restore the most ancient reading current in manuscripts of the Alexandrian text-type, using the agreement of the Western authorities (Old Latin and Greek Western Uncials) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest Alexandrian authorities differ.\n\nLachmann's edition of Lucretius (1850), which was the principal occupation of his life from 1845, is perhaps his greatest achievement of scholarship. He demonstrated how the three main manuscripts all derived from one archetype, containing 302 pages of 26 lines to a page. Further, he was able to show that this archetype was a copy of a manuscript written in a minuscule hand, which was in turn a copy of a manuscript of the 4th or 5th centuries written in rustic capitals. To say his recreation of the text was accepted is anticlimactic; HAJ Munro characterized this accomplishment as \"a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied.\" Lachmann also edited Propertius (1816); Catullus (1829); Tibullus (1829); Genesius (1834); Terentianus Maurus (1836); Babrius (1845); Avianus (1845); Gaius (1841–1842); the \"Agrimensores Romani\" (1848–1852); and Lucilius (edited after his death by Vahlen, 1876). He also translated Shakespeare's sonnets (1820) and \"Macbeth\" (1829).\n\n"}

English is a nominative-accusative language.\n\nNominative–accusative alignment can be realized through morphology, by visible coding properties, and/or syntax, by behavioral properties during participation in specific constructions. That type of alignment has a broad global distribution and is one of the major alignment systems characterizing a critical portion of the world’s languages.\n\nA transitive verb is associated with two noun phrases (or arguments): a subject and a direct object. An intransitive verb is associated with only one argument, a subject.\n\nNominative–accusative alignment uses the same coding system for subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs and a different coding system for direct objects of transitive verbs. The different kinds of arguments are represented as A, S, and O. A is the subject (or most agent-like) argument of a transitive verb, O is the direct object, (or most patient-like) argument of a transitive verb, and S is the sole argument of an intransitive verb.\n\nNominative–accusative languages contrast with ergative–absolutive languages, which use an alignment system that codes subjects of transitive verbs differently from subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. In an ergative–absolutive system, A is coded as ergative while S and O are coded as absolutive.\n\nIt is common for languages (such as Dyirbal and Standard Hindi) to have overlapping alignment systems, which exhibit both nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive coding, a phenomenon called split ergativity. In fact, there are relatively few languages that exhibit only ergative–absolutive alignment (called pure ergativity) and tend to be isolated in certain regions of the world, such as the Caucasus, parts of North America and Mesoamerica, the Tibetan Plateau, and Australia. Such languages include Sumerian, Standard Tibetan, and Mayan.\n\nIn a nominative–accusative language, accusativity can manifest itself in visible ways, called coding properties. Often, these visible properties are morphological and the distinction will appear as a difference in the actual morphological form and spelling of the word, or as case particles (pieces of morphology) which will appear before or after the word.\n\nIf a language exhibits morphological case marking, arguments S and A will appear in the nominative case and argument O will appear in the accusative case, or in a similar case such as the oblique. There may be more than one case fulfilling the accusative role; for instance, Finnish marks objects with the partitive or the accusative to contrast telicity. It is highly common for only accusative arguments to exhibit overt case marking while nominative arguments exhibit null (or absent) case markings. The last examples of Tamil and Hindi show the overt and null case marking distinctions.\n\nJapanese\n\nHindi\n\nRussian\n\nSpoken Tamil\n\nNot all arguments are equally likely to exhibit overt case marking. In fact, it is crosslinguistically common to divide direct objects into two classes (with respect to overt case marking), a phenomenon called ‘differential object marking’ by Bossong (1985). A direct object that is higher in prominence is more likely to be overtly case-marked.\n\nThe \"prominence\" is evaluated in the following ways:\n\nThese scales are also reflected in Silverstein’s person/animacy hierarchy.\n\nIn languages like Turkish, Kazakh language and Sakha, more \"prominent\" objects take an overt accusative marker while nonspecific ones do not. Lack of an overt case marker can restrict an object's distribution in the sentence. Those orders are permitted in Sakha if accusative case is overtly expressed:\n\nSakha\n\nHowever, when the object is nonspecific, alternative ordering is not permitted:\nSakha\n\nWhen the direct object is low on the definiteness scale, it must directly precede the verb, whereas alternative ordering is possible when the direct object is higher in prominence. It is important to note that notions of prominence (animacy and definiteness) and the boundaries between one tier of prominence and another may vary from culture to culture. In German, for example, accusative case is always overt on arguments with masculine gender.\n\nCase-marking is one of the formal guises of DSM, along with agreement, inverse systems and voice alterations, which goes hand in hand with DSM. The use of case marking on subject is to differentiate prominence in arguments. It can be used on subjects of transitive verbs and intransitive verbs. The definiteness and animacy scale of Differential Subject Marking has the same hierarchical structure exhibited in the section on Differential Object Marking. The functional motivation for the implementation of DSM and DOM is to avoid ambiguity as to what is subject and object in transitive clauses. The most natural hierarchy of animacy and definiteness places transitive subjects higher than transitive object.\n\nSome languages code very little through morphology and are more dependent on syntax to encode meaning and grammatical relationships. If a language relies less on overt case marking, alignment may be coded through word order, as in this example from Indonesian.\n\nIndonesian\n\nIn the following example from French, all subjects, both S and A, appear before the verb while O appears after the verb. Arguments occurring before the verb are coded as nominative, while arguments occurring directly after the verb are coded as accusative.\n\nFrench\n\nAlternatively, alignment can also manifest visibly through agreement on the verb. In the following example from Amharic, the verb is head-marked for both subject ‘3SG.M’ and object ‘3SG.M.O’.\n\nAmharic\n\nNominative–accusative alignment can also be distinguished through behavioral properties, in the way a nominative or accusative argument will behave when placed in particular syntactic constructions. This has to do with the impact of alignment on the level of the whole sentence rather than the individual word. Morphosyntactic alignment determines which arguments can be omitted in a coordinate structure during the process of conjunction reduction (deleting arguments from the ends of joined clauses). In nominative–accusative, only arguments S and A can be omitted and not argument O.\n\nEnglish\nThe omitted subject argument of the embedded clause must correspond to the subject (nominative) of the matrix-clause. If it corresponds to the object (accusative), the sentence is ungrammatical.\n\nIf English were an ergative–absolutive language, one would expect to see:\nHere the omitted argument of the embedded clause corresponds to the direct object (absolutive) of the matrix-clause. If it corresponds to the subject (ergative), the sentence is ungrammatical.\n\nThe alignment system also impacts the triggering and realization of other such syntactic processes as raising constructions, subject-controlled subject deletion and object-controlled subject deletion.\n\nLanguages exhibiting accusative alignment are the most widespread of all of the alignment types. These languages can be found on every continent, in comparison to languages with ergative alignment that are restricted to certain areas of the world, namely the Caucasus, parts of North American and Mesoamerica, the Tibetan plateau, and Australia. The map shows the distribution of languages with the various alignment types, and the following list gives a short sampling of accusative languages and their distribution across the globe:\n\n One of the ways in which the production of a nominative–accusative case marking system can be explained is from an Optimality Theoretic perspective. Case marking is said to fulfill two functions, or constraints: an identifying function and a distinguishing function. The identifying function is exemplified when case morphology encodes (identifies) specific semantic, thematic, or pragmatic properties or information about the nominal argument. Accusative case in the position of the direct object, for example, can be a strong identifier of patienthood. The distinguishing function is used to distinguish between the core arguments, the subject and the object, of a transitive clause. Helen de Hoop and Andrej Malchukov explain the motivation and need for the distinguishing function in \"Case marking strategies\":\n\nIt is rare for case to serve only the distinguishing function, which overlaps greatly with the ‘identify’ function. Other ways of disambiguating the arguments of a transitive predicate (subject agreement, word order restriction, context, intonation, etc.) may explain this cross-linguistic observation. De Hoop and Malchukov argue that case systems that are completely based on the identification function must be richer in case morphology compared to languages based mainly on the distinguishing function.\n\nOne theory that has been posited to account for the occurrence of accusative systems is that of functional pressure. When applied to languages, this theory operates around the various needs and pressures on a speech community. It has been suggested that languages have evolved to suit the needs of their users.These communities will develop some functional system to meet the needs that they have. So, it has been proposed that the accusative system arose from a functional pressure to avoid ambiguity and make communication a simpler process.\n\nIt is useful for languages to have a means of distinguishing between subjects and objects, and between arguments A, S, and O. This is helpful so that sentences like \"Tom hit Fred\" cannot be interpreted as \"Fred hit Tom.\" Tripartite alignment systems accomplish this differentiation by coding S, A and O all differently. However, this is not structurally economical, and tripartite systems are comparatively rare, but to have all arguments marked the same makes the arguments too ambiguous. Alongside the principle of distinguishability seems to operate a principle of economy. It is more efficient to have as few cases as possible without compromising intelligibility. In this way the dual pressures of efficiency and economy have produced a system which patterns two kinds of arguments together a third separately. Both accusative and ergative systems use this kind of grouping to make meaning clearer.\n\nBecause pronominal reference systems to the speaker, addressee, and a third person are so common (some argue universal) cross-linguistically, it would seem that pronoun systems are quite stable. However, the changes involved in second-person pronouns in English call this stability into question and highlight the significance of social forces in language development. The spread of feudalistic ideology caused many European languages to develop two sets of second-person singular pronouns in order to reflect hierarchy. Therefore, pronouns encoded not only person or number, but also the speaker's assessment of the addressee's status and the speaker-addressee relationship.\n\nFrom the thirteenth century, the Middle English plural pronouns 'ye' (nominative) and 'you' (accusative) were used to address single individuals in upper-class or courtly contexts. As a result, there were two sets of second-person singular pronouns, and the alternative singular pronouns 'thou' (nominative) and 'thee' (accusative) became increasingly associated with lower status. These distinctions had become established indices of social status by the fifteenth century, and they also developed as indicators of interpersonal relationships at this time: 'you' might show emotional distance or be used in a public setting, 'thou' familiarity/intimacy in a private setting. We see vestiges of this distinction in languages like German or French that have retained the T-V distinction, but second-person pronouns in these languages, as well as in Italian, Serbo-Croatian, and Swedish, have also begun to undergo change.\n\nUnder the pressure of social structural changes and movement towards egalitarian ideology, the English second-person singular pronouns later collapsed to a single term, 'you'. This contraction erased all visible morphological distinction between nominative and accusative case in the second person, effectively sacrificing distinguishability for economy.\n\nThere are instances in which nominative–accusative case marking can be used creatively, for example to generate a sense of formality. A common example in English is the use of the nominative form of the 1st person singular pronoun \"I\" in object, rather than subject, position. For example:\nversus\nThis variation between 'I' and 'me' (nominative and accusative) in object position has been linked to the social concerns of politeness and elevated language. This non-standard use of the nominative case in object position carries a certain linguistic prestige. People using this form are often perceived as educated and articulate. This variation shows up frequently in newspapers, magazines and political speeches as well as in daily conversation. Conversely, the use of the standard variant 'my wife and me' may seem to signal casualness or lack of sophistication. This illustrates how case marking is not only a system to be followed, but one that can be used creatively to encode particular social meanings.\n\n"}

He also bears responsibility for a small school of sociology that was prepared to accept his radical criticism of the subject.\n\nWinch saw himself as an uncompromising Wittgensteinian. He was not personally acquainted with Wittgenstein; Wittgenstein’s influence upon him was mostly mediated through that of Rush Rhees, who was his colleague at the University College of Swansea, now known as Swansea University, and whom Wittgenstein appointed as one of his literary executors. In 1980 Winch published Wittgenstein’s \"Culture and Value\", translated by himself. After the death of Rhees in 1989 he took over his position as literary executor.\n\nFrom Rush Rhees, Winch derived his interest in the religious writer Simone Weil. Part of the appeal was a break from Wittgenstein into a very different type of philosophy which could nevertheless be tackled with familiar methods. Also Weil’s ascetic, somewhat Tolstoyan, form of religion harmonised with one aspect of Wittgenstein’s personality.\n\nAt a time when most Anglo-American philosophers were heavily under the spell of Wittgenstein, Winch’s own approach was strikingly original. While much of his work was concerned with rescuing Wittgenstein from what he took to be misreadings, his own philosophy involved a shift of emphasis from the problems that preoccupied Oxford style ‘linguistic’ philosophy, towards justifying and explaining 'forms of life' in terms of consistent language games. He took Wittgensteinian philosophy into areas of ethics and religion, which Wittgenstein himself had relatively neglected, sometimes showing considerable originality. An example is his illuminating treatment of the moral difference between someone who tries and fails to commit murder and someone who succeeds, in his essay \"Trying\" in \"Ethics and Action\". With the decline of interest in Wittgenstein, Winch himself was increasingly neglected and the challenge his arguments presented to much contemporary philosophy was sidestepped or ignored. In insisting on the continuity of Wittgenstein’s concerns from the \"Tractatus\" through to the \"Philosophical Investigations\", Winch made a powerful case for Wittgenstein’s mature philosophy, as he understood it, as the consummation and legitimate heir of the entire analytic tradition.\n\nWittgenstein famously said that philosophy leaves the world as it is. Winch takes his ideas into regions that have strong moral and political implications.\n\n\n"}

Process reliabilism has been used as an argument against philosophical skepticism, such as the brain in a vat thought experiment.\nProcess reliabilism is a form of epistemic externalism.\n\nA broadly reliabilist theory of knowledge is roughly as follows:\n\nOne knows that \"p\" (\"p\" stands for any proposition—e.g., that the sky is blue) if and only if \"p\" is true, one believes that \"p\" is true, and one has arrived at the belief that \"p\" through some \"reliable process.\"\n\nA broadly reliabilist theory of justified belief can be stated as follows:\n\nOne has a justified belief that \"p\" if, and only if, the belief is the result of a reliable process.\n\nMoreover, a similar account can be given (and an elaborate version of this has been given by Alvin Plantinga) for such notions as 'warranted belief' or 'epistemically rational belief'.\n\nLeading proponents of reliabilist theories of knowledge and justification have included Alvin Goldman, Marshall Swain, Kent Bach and more recently, Alvin Plantinga. Goldman's article \"A Causal Theory of Knowing\" (\"Journal of Philosophy\", 64 (1967), pp. 357–372) is generally credited as being the first full treatment of the theory, though D. M. Armstrong is also regarded as an important source, and (according to Hugh Mellor) Frank Ramsey was the very first to state the theory, albeit in passing.\n\nOne classical or traditional analysis of 'knowledge' is \"justified true belief\". In order to have a valid claim of knowledge for any proposition, one must be justified in believing \"p\" and \"p\" must be true. Since Gettier proposed his counterexamples the traditional analysis has included the further claim that knowledge must be more than justified true belief. Reliabilist theories of knowledge are sometimes presented as an alternative to that theory: rather than justification, all that is required is that the belief be the product of a reliable process. But reliabilism need not be regarded as an alternative, but instead as a further explication of the traditional analysis. On this view, those who offer reliabilist theories of justification further analyze the 'justification' part of the traditional analysis of 'knowledge' in terms of reliable processes. Not all reliabilists agree with such accounts of justification, but some do.\n\nSome find reliabilism of justification objectionable because it entails externalism, which is the view that one can have knowledge, or have a justified belief, despite not knowing (having \"access\" to) the evidence, or other circumstances, that make the belief justified. Most reliabilists maintain that a belief can be justified, or can constitute knowledge, \"even if\" the believer does not know about or understand the process that makes the belief reliable. In defending this view, reliabilists (and externalists generally) are apt to point to examples from simple acts of perception: if one sees a bird in the tree outside one's window and thereby gains the belief that there is a bird in that tree, one might not at all understand the cognitive processes that account for one's successful act of perception; nevertheless, it is the fact that the processes worked reliably that accounts for why one's belief is justified. In short, one finds one holds a belief about the bird, and that belief is justified if any is, but one is not acquainted at all with the processes that led to the belief that justified one's having it. \n\nAnother of the most common objections to reliabilism, made first to Goldman's reliable process theory of knowledge and later to other reliabilist theories, is the so-called generality problem. For any given justified belief (or instance of knowledge), one can easily identify many different (concurrently operating) \"processes\" from which the belief results. My belief that there is a bird in the tree outside my window might be accorded a result of the process of forming beliefs on the basis of sense-perception, of visual sense-perception, of visual sense-perception through non-opaque surfaces in daylight, and so forth, down to a variety of different very specifically described processes. Some of these processes might be statistically reliable, while others might not. It would no doubt be better to say, in any case, that we are choosing not which process to say resulted in the belief, but instead how to describe the process, out of the many different levels of generality on which it can be accurately described.\n\nAn objection in a similar line was formulated by Stephen Stich in \"The Fragmentation of Reason\". Reliabilism usually considers that for generating justified beliefs a process needs to be reliable in a set of relevant possible scenarios. However, according to Stich, these scenarios are chosen in a culturally biased manner. Stich does not defend any alternative theory of knowledge or justification, but instead argues that all accounts of normative epistemic terms are culturally biased and instead only a pragmatic account can be given.\n\nAnother objection to reliabilism is called the \"new evil demon problem\". The evil demon problem originally motivated skepticism, but can be resuited to object to reliabilist accounts as follows: If our experiences are controlled by an evil demon, it may be the case that we believe ourselves to be doing things that we are not doing. However, these beliefs are clearly justified. Robert Brandom has called for a clarification of the role of belief in reliabilist theories. Brandom is concerned that unless the role of belief is stressed, reliabilism may attribute knowledge to things that would otherwise be considered incapable of possessing it. Brandom gives the example of a parrot that has been trained to consistently respond to red visual stimuli by saying 'that's red'. The proposition is true, the mechanism that produced it is reliable, but Brandom is reluctant to say that the parrot \"knows\" it is seeing red because he thinks it cannot \"believe\" that it is. For Brandom, beliefs pertain to concepts: without the latter there can be no former. Concepts are products of the 'game of giving and asking for reasons'. Hence, only those entities capable of reasoning, through language in a social context, can for Brandom believe and thus have knowledge. Brandom may be regarded as hybridising externalism and internalism, allowing knowledge to be accounted for by reliable external process so long as a knower possess some internal understanding of why the belief is reliable.\n\n"}

He made important contributions to semantics, the debate over God’s knowledge of future contingents, discussions of predestination, grace, and merit, and philosophical theology more generally.\n\nModern interest in Holcot has been limited. His influence in the late Middle Ages, however, was clearly great, as is evidenced by the number of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century manuscripts of his work that have survived. For example, there exist 48 manuscripts of Holcot’s Questions on the Sentences (compared to 36 manuscripts of William of Ockham’s Sentences commentary). More impressive are the 175 manuscripts of his commentary on the \"Book of Wisdom\" (\"Lectiones super librum Sapientiae\"), a work that has been identified as a prime literary source for Chaucer's \"Nun's Priest's Tale\". Holcot was still read in the sixteenth-century when the Parisian theologian, Jacques Almain, wrote a work engaging Holcot's opinions.\nThe commentary on the \"Book of Wisdom\" was printed in 1480, and, subsequently, went through many editions. An edition of the questions on the Sentences was printed at Lyon in 1497, although it contained a cover letter stating that the manuscripts used to produce this edition were disorderly and unreliable.

{"id": "938607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938607", "title": "Solomon ibn Gabirol", "text": "Solomon ibn Gabirol\n\nSolomon ibn Gabirol (also Solomon ben Judah; \"Shlomo Ben Yehuda ibn Gabirol\", ; \"Abu Ayyub Sulayman bin Yahya bin Jabirul\", ) was an 11th-century Andalusian poet and Jewish philosopher with a Neo-Platonic bent. He published over a hundred poems, as well as works of biblical exegesis, philosophy, ethics and satire. One source credits ibn Gabirol with creating a golem, possibly female, for household chores.\n\nIn the 19th century it was discovered that medieval translators had Latinized Gabirol's name to Avicebron or Avencebrol and had translated his work on Jewish Neo-Platonic philosophy into a Latin form that had in the intervening centuries been highly regarded as a work of Islamic or Christian scholarship. As such, ibn Gabirol is well known in the history of philosophy for the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form (“Universal Hylomorphism”), and for his emphasis on divine will.\n\nLittle is known of Gabirol's life, and some sources give contradictory information. Sources agree that he was born in Málaga, but are unclear whether in late 1021 or early 1022 CE. The year of his death is a matter of dispute, with conflicting accounts having him dying either before age 30 or by age 48.\n\nGabirol lived a life of material comfort, never having to work to sustain himself, but he lived a difficult and loveless life, suffering ill health, misfortunes, fickle friendships, and powerful enemies. From his teenage years, he suffered from some disease, possibly lupus vulgaris, that would leave him embittered and in constant pain. He indicates in his poems that he considered himself short and ugly. Of his personality, Moses ibn Ezra wrote: \"his irascible temperament dominated his intellect, nor could he rein the demon that was within himself. It came easily to him to lampoon the great, with salvo upon salvo of mockery and sarcasm.\" He has been described summarily as \"a social misfit.\"\n\nGabirol's writings indicate that his father was a prominent figure in Córdoba, but was forced to relocate to Málaga during a political crisis in 1013. Gabirol's parents died while he was a child, leaving him an orphan with no siblings or close relatives. He was befriended, supported and protected by a prominent political figure of the time, Yekutiel ibn Hassan al-Mutawakkil ibn Qabrun, and moved to Zaragoza, then an important center of Jewish culture. Gabirol's anti-social temperament, occasionally boastful poetry, and sharp wit earned him powerful enemies, but as long as Jekuthiel lived, Gabirol remained safe from them and was able to freely immerse himself in study of the Talmud, grammar, geometry, astronomy, and philosophy. However, when Gabirol was seventeen years old, his benefactor was assassinated as the result of a political conspiracy, and by 1045 Gabirol found himself compelled to leave Zaragoza. He was then sponsored by no less than the grand vizier and top general to the kings of Granada, Samuel ibn Naghrillah (Shmuel HaNaggid). Gabirol made ibn Naghrillah an object of praise in his poetry until an estrangement arose between them and ibn Naghrillah became the butt of Gabirol's bitterest irony. It seems Gabirol never married, and that he spent the remainder of his life wandering.\n\nGabirol had become an accomplished poet and philosopher at an early age:\n\nAs mentioned above, the conflicting accounts of Gabirol's death have him dying either before age 30 or by age 48. The opinion of earliest death, that he died before age 30, is believed to be based upon a misreading of medieval sources. The remaining two opinions are that he died either in 1069 or 1070, or around 1058 in Valencia. As to the circumstances of his death, one legend claims that he was trampled to death by an Arab horseman. A second legend relates that he was murdered by a Muslim poet who was jealous of Gabirol's poetic gifts, and who secretly buried him beneath the roots of a fig tree. The tree bore fruit in abundant quantity and of extraordinary sweetness. Its uniqueness excited attention and provoked an investigation. The resulting inspection of the tree uncovered Gabirol's remains, and led to the identification and execution of the murderer.\n\nThough Gabirol's legacy was esteemed throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, it was historically minimized by two errors of scholarship that mis-attributed his works.\n\nGabirol seems to have often been called \"the Málagan\", after his place of birth, and would occasionally so refer to himself when encrypting his signature in his poems (e.g. in \"שטר עלי בעדים\" he embeds his signature as an acrostic, in the form \"אני שלמה הקטן ברבי יהודה גבירול מאלקי חזק\"). While in Modern Hebrew the city is also called Málaga (), that is in deference to its current Spanish pronunciation. In Gabirol's day, when it was ruled by Arabic speakers, it was called \"Mālaqa\" (), as it is to this day by Arabic speakers. The 12th-century Arab philosopher Jabir ibn Aflah misinterpreted manuscript signatures of the form \"שלמה ... יהודה ... אלמלאק\" to mean \"Solomon ... the Jew .. the king\", and so ascribed to Solomon some seventeen philosophical essays of Gabirol. The 15th-century Jewish philosopher Yohanan Alemanno imported that error back into the Hebrew canon, and added another four works to the list of false ascriptions.\n\nIn 1846, Solomon Munk discovered among the Hebrew manuscripts in the French National Library in Paris a work by Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera. Comparing it with a Latin work by Avicebron entitled \"Fons Vitæ\", Munk proved them to both excerpt an Arabic original of which the \"Fons Vitæ\" was evidently the translation. Munk concluded that Avicebron or Avencebrol, who had for centuries been believed to be a Christian or Arabic Muslim philosopher, was instead identical with the Jewish Solomon ibn Gabirol. The centuries-long confusion was in part due to a content feature atypical in Jewish writings: \"Fons Vitæ\" exhibits an independence of Jewish religious dogma and does not cite Biblical verses or Rabbinic sources.\n\nThe progression in the Latinization of Gabirol's name seems to have been ibn Gabirol, Ibngebirol, Avengebirol. Avengebrol, Avencebrol, Avicebrol, and finally Avicebron. Some sources still refer to him as Avicembron, Avicenbrol, or Avencebrol.\n\nGabirol, in his poem \"כשרש עץ\" (line 24), claims to have written twenty philosophical works. Through scholarly deduction (see above), we know their titles, but we only have the texts of two.\n\nGabirol made his mark on the history of philosophy under his alias as Avicebron, one of the first teachers of Neo-Platonism in Europe, and author of \"Fons Vitæ\" . As such, he is best known for the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form (“Universal Hylomorphism”), and for his emphasis on divine will.\n\nHis role has been compared to that of Philo: both were ignored by their fellow Jews, but exercised considerable influence upon Gentiles (Philo upon primitive Christianity, Gabirol upon medieval Christian scholasticism); and both served as cultural intermediaries (Philo between Hellenistic philosophy and the Oriental world; Gabirol between Greco-Arabic philosophy and the Occident).\n\n\"Fons Vitæ\" (, , lit. \"Source of Life\", cf. ) is a Neo-Platonic philosophical dialogue between master and disciple on the nature of Creation and how understanding what we are (our nature) can help us know how to live (our purpose). \"His goal is to understand the nature of being and human being so that he might better understand and better inspire the pursuit of knowledge and the doing of good deeds.\" The work stands out in the history of philosophy for introducing the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form, and for its emphasis on divine will.\n\nIn the closing sentences of the Fons \"Vitæ\" (5.43, p. 338, line 21), ibn Gabirol further describes this state of “return” as a liberation from death and a cleaving to the source of life.\n\nThe work was originally composed in Arabic, of which no copies are extant. It was preserved for the ages by a translation into Latin in the year 1150 by Abraham ibn Daud and Dominicus Gundissalinus, who was the first official director of the Toledo School of Translators, a scholastic philosopher, and the archdeacon of Segovia, Spain. In the 13th century, Shem Tov ibn Falaquera wrote a summary of \"Fons\" \"Vitæ\" in Hebrew, and only in 1926 was the full Latin text was translated into Hebrew.\n\n\"Fons Vitæ\" consists of five sections:\n\n\"Fons Vitæ\" posits that the basis of existence and the source of life in every created thing is a combination of \"matter\" () and \"form\". The doctrine of matter and form informed the work's subtitle: \"\"De Materia et Forma.\" Its chief doctrines are:\n\nThough Gabirol as a philosopher was ignored by the Jewish community, Gabirol as a poet was not, and through his poetry, he introduced his philosophical ideas. His best-known poem, , is a philosophical treatise in poetical form, the \"double\" of the \"Fons Vitæ\". For example, the eighty-third line of the poem points to one of the teachings of the \"Fons Vitæ\"; namely, that all the attributes predicated of God exist apart in thought alone and not in reality.\n\nMoses ibn Ezra is the first to mention Gabirol as a philosopher, praising his intellectual achievements, and quoting several passages from the \"Fons Vitæ\" in his own work, \"Aruggat ha-Bosem\". Abraham ibn Ezra, who cites Gabirol's philosophico-allegorical Bible interpretation, borrows from the \"Fons Vitæ\" both in his prose and in his poetry without giving due credit.\n\nThe 12th-century philosopher Joseph ibn Tzaddik borrows extensively from the \"Fons Vitæ\" in his work \"Microcosmos\".\n\nAnother 12th-century philosopher, Abraham ibn Daud of Toledo, was the first to take exception to Gabirol's teachings. In \"Sefer ha-Kabbalah\" he praises Gabirol as a poet. But to counteract the influence of ibn Gabirol the philosopher, he wrote an Arabic book, translated into Hebrew under the title \"Emunah Ramah\", in which he reproaches Gabirol for having philosophized without any regard to the requirements of the Jewish religious position and bitterly accuses him of mistaking a number of poor reasons for one good one. He criticizes Gabirol for being repetitive, wrong-headed and unconvincing.\n\nOccasional traces of ibn Gabriol's thought are found in some of the Kabbalistic literature of the 13th century. Later references to ibn Gabirol, such as those of Elijah Chabillo, Isaac Abarbanel, Judah Abarbanel, Moses Almosnino, and Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, are based on an acquaintance with the scholastic philosophy, especially the works of Aquinas.\n\nThe 13th-century a Jewish philosopher Berechiah ha-Nakdan drew upon Gabirol's works in his encyclopedic philosophical text \"Sefer Haḥibbur\" (, , lit. \"The Book of Compilation\").\n\nFor over six centuries, the Christian world regarded \"Fons Vitæ\" as the work of a Christian philosopher or Arabic Muslim philosopher, and it became a cornerstone and bone of contention in many theologically charged debates between Franciscans and Dominicans. The Aristotelian Dominicans led by St. Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas opposed the teachings of \"Fons Vitæ\"; the Platonist Franciscans led by Duns Scotus supported its teachings, and led to its acceptance in Christian philosophy, influencing later philosophers such as the 16th-century Dominican friar Giordano Bruno. Other early supporters of Gabirol's philosophy include the following:\n\n\nThe main points at issue between Gabirol and Aquinas were as follows:\n\n\"The Improvement of the Moral Qualities\" (, ) is an ethical treatise that has been called by Munk \"a popular manual of morals.\" It was composed by Gabirol at Zaragoza in 1045, at the request of some friends who wished to possess a book treating of the qualities of man and the methods of effecting their improvement.\n\nThe innovations in the work are that it presents the principles of ethics independently of religious dogma and that it proposes that the five physical senses are emblems and instruments of virtue and vice, but not their agents; thus, a person's inclination to vice is subject to a person's will to change. Gabirol presents a tabular diagram of the relationship of twenty qualities to the five senses, reconstructed at right, and urges his readers to train the qualities of their souls unto good through self-understanding and habituation. He regards man's ability to do so as an example of divine benevolence.\n\nWhile this work of Gabirol is not widely studied in Judaism, it has many points in common with Bahya ibn Paquda's very popular work \"Chovot HaLevavot\", written in 1040, also in Zaragoza.\n\n\"Mivchar HaPeninim\" (. lit. \"The Choice of Pearls\"), an ethics work of sixty-four chapters, has been attributed to Gabirol since the 19th century, but this is doubtful. It was originally published, along with a short commentary, in Soncino, Italy, in 1484, and has since been re-worked and re-published in many forms and abridged editions (e.g. Joseph Ḳimcḥi versified the work under the title \"Shekel ha-Kodesh\").\n\nThe work is a collection of maxims, proverbs, and moral reflections, many of them of Arabic origin, and bears a strong similarity to the Florilegium of Hunayn ibn Ishaq and other Arabic and Hebrew collections of ethics sayings, which were highly prized by both Arabs and Jews.\n\nGabirol wrote both sacred and secular poems, in Hebrew, and was recognized even by his critics (e.g. Moses ibn Ezra and Yehuda Alharizi) as the greatest poet of his age. His secular poems express disillusionment with social mores and worldliness, but are written with a sophistication and artistry that reveals him to have been socially influenced by his worldly Arabic contemporaries.\n\nGabirol's lasting poetic legacy, however, was his sacred works. Today, \"his religious lyrics are considered by many to be the most powerful of their kind in the medieval Hebrew tradition, and his long cosmological masterpiece, \"Keter Malchut\", is acknowledged today as one of the greatest poems in all of Hebrew literature.\" His verses are distinctive for tackling complex metaphysical concepts, expressing scathing satire, and declaring his religious devotion unabashedly.\n\nGabirol wrote with a pure Biblical Hebrew diction that would become the signature style of the Spanish school of Hebrew poets, and he popularized in Hebrew poetry the strict Arabic meter introduced by Dunash ben Labrat. Abraham ibn Ezra calls Gabirol, not ben Labrat, \"the writer of metric songs,\" and in \"Sefer Zaḥot\" uses Gabirol's poems to illustrate various poetic meters.\n\nHe wrote also more than one hundred piyyuṭim and selichot for the Sabbath, festivals, and fast-days, most of which have been included in the Holy Day prayer books of Sephardim, Ashkenazim, and even Karaites. Some of his most famous in liturgical use include the following:\n\nGabirol's most famous poem is \"Keter Malchut\" (lit. Royal Crown), which, in 900 lines, describes the cosmos as testifying to its own creation by God, based upon the then current (11th-century) scientific understanding of the cosmos.\n\nGabirol's poetry has been set to music by the modern composer Aaron Jay Kernis, in a piece titled \"Symphony of Meditations.\" \n\n\n\n"}

After having received a mathematical-scientific Matura (Typus C) from the Gymnasium Köniz-Lebermatt, Switzerland, she studied mathematics, economics, philosophy, and history at the Universität Basel, Université Paris I Panthéone-Sorbonne, Johann-Wolfgang Goethe Universität, and Oxford University. She received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh in 2007, where her thesis dealt with conceptual content and inference.\n\nSchellenberg held a Mellon postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto from 2006 to 2008 which was curtailed when she chose to move to a postdoctoral position at the Australian National University, where she subsequently became an assistant professor in 2008, and an associate professor in 2010. Schellenberg was the first woman to hold a permanent academic appointment in Philosophy at the Australia National University's Research School of Social Sciences. In 2011, Schellenberg moved to Rutgers University, as an associate professor in the Department of Philosophy with a secondary appointment at Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science. Brian Weatherson and Jonathan L. Kvanvig regarded Schellenberg's move to Rutgers as buttressing Rutgers' reputation as having one of the pre-eminent epistemology departments in the world.\n\nSchellenberg's work has centered around developing a comprehensive account of the epistemological and phenomenological role of perception. Her view shows how the epistemic force of experience is grounded in employing perceptual capacities that we possess by virtue of being perceivers Schellenberg has also developed an account of the nature of perceptual content that suggests a new way to understand singular modes of presentation, arguing that perceptual experience is at root both relational and representational. In addition to her main areas of interest, Schellenberg has also written papers on topics such as inferential semantics, the philosophy of Gottlob Frege, and imagination. Much of Schellenberg's work to-date has focused on reconcilling apparently contradictory viewpoints on topics in the philosophy of mind.\n\nSchellenberg has published a series of articles in leading journals such as The Journal of Philosophy, Mind, Noûs, and Philosophy and Phenomenological Research.\n\n"}

It comes from the Maha Gopalaka Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 33). It is also used in the commentaries, especially the one on the Maha Satipahna Sutta (Digha Nikaya 22) and the Satipahna Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 10). As Buddhism spread throughout South-East Asia, the simile of the bull spread with it.\n\nThe well-known ten ox-herding pictures emerged in China in the 12th century. D.T. Suzuki mentions four Chinese versions of the Oxherding Pictures, by Ching-chu (Jp. Seikyo)(11th century), Tzu-te Hui (Jp. Jitoku)(1090-1159), an unknown author, and Kuòān Shīyuǎn (Jp. Kaku-an) (12th century). The best-known of these is the version by Kuòān Shīyuǎn.\n\nProbably the first series was made by Ching-chu (清居, Jp. Seikyo) (11th century), who may have been a contemporary of Kuòān Shīyuǎn. In Ching-chu's version only five pictures are being used, and the ox's colour changes from dark to white, representing the gradual development of the practitioner, ending in the disappearance of the practitioner.\n\nTzu-te Hui (自得慧暉, Zide Huihui, Jp. Jitoku) (1090-1159) made a version with six pictures. The sixth one goes beyond the stage of absolute emptiness, where Ching-chu's version ends. Just like Ching-chu's version, the ox grows whiter along the way.\n\nA third version by an unknown author, with ten pictures, was most popular in China. It belongs to the Ching-chu and Tzu-te Hui series of pictures, and has a somewhat different serie of pictures compared to Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version. The 1585-edition contains a preface by Chu-hung, and it has ten pictures, each of which is preceded by Pu-ming's poem, of whom Chu-hung furtherwise provides no information. In this version too the ox's colour changes from dark to white.\n\nThe best known version of the oxherding pictures was drawn by the 12th century Chinese Rinzai Chán (Zen) master Kuòān Shīyuǎn (廓庵師遠, Jp. Kaku-an Shi-en), who also wrote accompanying poems and introductory words attached to the pictures. In Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version there is no whitening process, and his series also doesn't end with mere emptiness, or absolute truth, but shows a return to the world, depicting Putai, the laughing Buddha. According to Chi Kwang Sunim, they may also represent a Zen Buddhist interpretation of the ten Bodhisattva bhumi, the ten stages on the Bodhisattva-path. \n\nIn Japan, Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version gained a wide circulation, the earliest one probably belonging to the fifteenth century. They first became widely known in the West after their inclusion in the 1957 book, \"Zen Flesh, Zen Bones: A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings\", by Paul Reps and Nyogen Senzaki.\n\nLiaoan Qingyu (了菴清欲, Jp. Ryōan Seiyoku) (1288-1363) made another version with five pictures.\n\nVerses by Kuòān Shīyuǎn; translation by Senzaki Nyogen (千崎如幻) (1876–1958) and Paul Reps (1895-1990); paintings traditionally attributed to Tenshō Shūbun (天章周文) (1414-1463).\n\nThe ox-herding pictures had an immediate and extensive influence on the Chinese practice of Chan Buddhism.\n\nIn the West, Alan Watts included a description of the Ten Bulls in \"The Spirit of Zen\". The pictures were eventually to influence the work of John Cage, particularly in his emphasis on rhythmic silence, and on images of nothingness. At the same time, through the last picture especially – 'In the Marketplace' – they have provided a conceptual umbrella for those Buddhists seeking a greater engagement with the post-industrial global marketplace.\n\nAn equivalent series of stages is depicted in the Nine Stages of Tranquility, used in the Mahamudra tradition, in which the mind is represented by an elephant and a monkey. The \"Dharma Fellowship\", a Kagyu (Mahamudra) organisation, notes that the practice starts with studying and pondering the dharma, where-after the practice of meditation commences.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of the major monasteries have been at least partially re-established, while many others remain in ruins.\n\nMongolian Buddhism derives from the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. In Mongolia during the 1920s, approximately one third of males were monks, though many lived outside monasteries.

{"id": "43369485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43369485", "title": "Westworld (TV series)", "text": "Westworld (TV series)\n\nWestworld is an American science fiction Western television series created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Produced by HBO, it is based on the 1973 film of the same name (written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent the film's 1976 sequel, \"Futureworld\". The story takes place in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced Wild-West-themed amusement park populated by android \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying \"guests\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans.\n\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with J. J. Abrams, Jerry Weintraub, and Bryan Burk. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season, which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. \"Westworld\"s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of \"True Detective\" in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. On May 1, 2018, \"Westworld\" was renewed for a third season.\n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and performances.\n\nIn an unspecified time in the future, Westworld, one of six theme parks owned and operated by Delos Inc., allows guests to experience the American Old West in an environment populated by \"hosts\", androids programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire. The hosts, who are nearly indistinguishable from humans, follow a predefined set of intertwining narratives but have the ability to deviate from these narratives based on interactions they have with guests.\n\nThe hosts repeat their multi-day narratives anew each cycle. At the beginning of each new cycle (typically following the host’s “death”), each host has its memories of the previous period erased. This continues hundreds or thousands of times until it is decommissioned or repurposed for use in other narratives. For guest safety, hosts’ programming prevents them from physically harming human guests; this allows guests nearly unlimited freedom to engage without retribution in any activity they choose with the hosts, including rape and murder. Staff, situated in a control center called \"The Mesa\", which is connected to the park through vast underground facilities, oversee daily operations, develop new narratives, and perform repairs on hosts as necessary.\n\nAaron Paul will join the series in the third season as a main cast member in an undisclosed role.\n\nDr. Ford's \"Reveries\" update, which allows hosts to subconsciously access memories from their previous loops, gradually awakens some hosts like Dolores and Maeve to their true nature. Dolores seeks to solve \"the maze\", a means to achieve sentience envisioned by Arnold, Ford's partner in co-founding Westworld. Arnold had been unable to achieve this before the park opened, and had Dolores kill him and the other hosts so as to protect them; Bernard is discovered to be a host built by Dr. Ford in Arnold's image, used to help Dolores reach the center of the maze and achieve sentience. The Man in Black, revealed to be the same person as young William, shown in flashbacks during his first visit to the park, also seeks to find the maze, but is told by Ford that it is not for him. Meanwhile, Maeve is able to reconfigure her own programming, including the ability to control other hosts, so as to try to find the host that was her daughter. The season concludes as Ford announces the start of a new narrative at a gala in the park, just as Dolores decides to kill Ford and many guests, triggering a host uprising.\n\nThe second season follows in the aftermath of Dolores' uprising, as she recruits a number of hosts to fight off arriving Delos security forces, while looking for the key to the Valley Beyond, believed by the Ghost Nation to be a door to the next world. Maeve continues to search for her daughter, learning that there are other parks like Westworld. William finds that Ford has left him clues to find \"the door\", a new game for him to play, during which he encounters his estranged daughter Emily, who blames him for her mother's death. Delusional, William abandons Emily, thinking she is a host. Dolores, with Bernard's help, finds the Forge, where memories from all the guests to the park have been kept. Bernard helps a number of hosts transfer their programming to a digital space. Dolores wants to wipe out the guests' records, and seeks a means to kill them in the real world. With more Delos forces converging on the park to suppress the uprising, Dolores manages to fool them and escape the park to the real world, taking with her Bernard's and a few other hosts' cores. She recreates the Bernard host, as she expects she will need his help for the hosts to survive outside of the park, even if he is her enemy in that effort.\n\nThe series is based on the 1973 film of the same name (which was written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent its 1976 sequel, \"Futureworld\". It is the second series based on Crichton's original story after \"Beyond Westworld\" (1980), which aired for only three episodes on CBS before being cancelled.\n\nWarner Bros. had been considering a remake of \"Westworld\" since the early 1990s. After the departure of studio executive Jessica Goodman in 2011, the project was again under consideration. Jerry Weintraub had been pushing for a remake for years and, after his success with HBO's \"Behind the Candelabra\", he convinced the network to greenlight a pilot. He took the project to Jonathan Nolan and co-writer Lisa Joy, who saw the potential in the concept to make something far more ambitious than the original film.\n\nOn August 31, 2013, HBO announced that they had ordered a pilot for a potential television series, with Nolan, Joy, J. J. Abrams, Jerry Weintraub and Bryan Burk as executive producers. Ed Brubaker served on the writing staff as supervising producer, co-writing the fourth episode with Nolan. HBO later announced that \"Westworld\" had been \"taken to series\" and that it would premiere in 2015. In August 2015, HBO released the first teaser, which revealed that the series would premiere in 2016.\n\nAbrams suggested that the series be told with the perspective of the \"hosts\" in mind. Nolan took inspiration from video games like \"BioShock Infinite\", \"Red Dead Redemption\" and \"\" to deal with the narrative's moral component on a spectrum. During the research, the films of Sergio Leone provided reference points for the characters and visuals; novels by Philip K. Dick informed them about dilemmas concerning artificial intelligence, and for world-building and interlocking narrative, they consulted the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games. The 1973 film also included a Roman World and Medieval World, but Nolan has counted these out.Nolan explained the series would explore, through its paying-guest characters, why \"violence is in most of the stories we like to watch, but it isn't part of what we like to do\". The autonomous existence of non-player characters in video games influenced the approach to the individual storylines in \"Westworld\" that are reset in a continuous loop. A recitation from \"Romeo and Juliet\"—\"These violent delights have violent ends\"—is made part of the series as a virus trigger within the hosts that alters how they perceive their existence. The series explores ideas about the bicameral mind by the psychologist Julian Jaynes, who argued for the existence of two separate minds—one that gives instructions, and another that performs them. Jaynes discussed how consciousness comes from breaking down the wall between them by exposing the individual to new stimuli.\n\nCostume designer Ane Crabtree approached her work by taking as inspiration the historical attire of the Wild West from the 1850s to the 1890s, as opposed looking purely at Westerns. Fabrics were custom-woven, dyed and printed for any actor with a speaking role to capture the intricacies of the costumes (most of which were manufactured from scratch). Hat designs were described as the most challenging part of the process.\n\nThe writers and producers have planned for the story to last up to five seasons.\n\nIn November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season, which premiered on April 22, 2018. On May 1, 2018, the series was renewed for a third season.\n\nAfter the last episode of the first season was broadcast, Nolan and Joy revealed that they had operated on a strict \"need-to-know\" basis with most of the actors, in order to \"keep the story as fresh and present for them as possible.\" For example, in Wood's case, they gave her strange acting directions without explaining why, and it took a while for Wood to infer she was actually playing five distinct characters within the same host: four different behavioral modes for Dolores, plus Wyatt. By contrast, Hopkins was made aware of Ford's general story arc up front (at the time he was pitched the role) to ensure he could fully convey the complexity of the character in his performance. Even with that knowledge, Hopkins was given heavily redacted scripts, and had to insist on access to complete scripts.\n\nEarly on it was decided that the series would be shot on 35 mm film with assistance from HD taps, despite increasing difficulties in acquiring film stock. For a softer look, the filmmakers used Arri Zeiss master prime lenses with their coatings removed. The series was primarily shot on Kodak motion-picture film, which was processed by FotoKem in Burbank and scanned by Encore Hollywood to create digital intermediates of all takes suitable for use as dailies. The final cut was delivered to HBO in 2K JPEG digital format for broadcast and to Warner Bros. Television as a cut negative for archival purposes.\n\nSince much of the series is seen from the hosts' point of view, Steadicams were used to film the whole first season, except for a couple of scenes in the last episode, where a handheld camera was used as a metaphor for hosts who broke free from their programming and acted of their own free will. Filming for the series' pilot episode took place during a 22-day period in August 2014 in and around Los Angeles, and in Moab, Utah.Filming locations in California included various soundstages, backlots at both Universal Studios and Warner Bros., the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, the Melody Ranch in Santa Clarita, Big Sky Ranch, the Skirball Cultural Center and the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, and the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. The Melody Ranch set used for the town of Sweetwater had been used previously for many western films, such as \"Django Unchained\" and \"The Magnificent Seven\", but was significantly upgraded for \"Westworld\" by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier. Green screens were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later merged digitally with exterior shots from Utah. For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the Fillmore and Western Railway for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film \"The Lone Ranger\". F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. Hawthorne Plaza was used for filming the \"cold storage\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.\n\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of John Ford, who shot four of his Western films in Castle Valley, east of Moab. In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place. Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah, including Castle Valley. Most Utah locations, like Dead Horse Point State Park, were \"walk-in\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear. Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land. To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California. For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs. The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along Utah State Route 128.\n\nThe 3D printing of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely practical effects, of which some were polished by the visual effects team. The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded. Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.\n\nIn November 2018, some of the sets located at Paramount Ranch were destroyed by the Woolsey Fire.\n\nThe series' title sequence was created by Elastic, the same production studio that created the title sequences for three other HBO series: \"Rome\", \"Carnivàle\", and \"Game of Thrones\". Patrick Clair acted as creative director for the title sequence, which took about five weeks to conceptualize.\n\nClair met with Nolan and Joy in February 2016 to discuss its development. He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent psychological study. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via computer-aided design. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer Ramin Djawadi of a player piano in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the \"Westworld\" production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in computer-generated imagery. Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to Kurt Vonnegut's first novel \"Player Piano\". It was meant to represent the first Rube Goldberg machine to evoke human motion. Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano—\"a primitive form of robot\"—as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \"being created to be made redundant.\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man came about from Clair's wish to convey \"Westworld\"s depiction of the naked human body. The sequence also refers to Chris Cunningham's 1999 music video for the Björk song \"All Is Full of Love\", in a way that Clair called \"a bit shameless ... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\"\n\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by industrial robots. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction. As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of robotics, he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an iris.\n\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse are now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores). Ramin Djawadi's score stays the same, with the images of the player piano intact.\n\nOriginal music for the series is composed by Ramin Djawadi, who also worked with showrunner Nolan on \"Person of Interest\". The main theme blends the use of bass notes, light arpeggios and melody, all of which complement the idea of an amusement park. The first season soundtrack was released on December 5, 2016.\n\nThe first season prominently featured a number of re-workings of popular songs for player piano and strings, among them Kanye West's \"Runaway\", Radiohead's \"No Surprises\", \"Fake Plastic Trees\", \"Motion Picture Soundtrack\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film)\"; Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun\"; The Rolling Stones' \"Paint It Black\"; \"Pine Apple Rag\" and \"Peacherine Rag\" by Scott Joplin; Claude Debussy's \"\"Reverie\" for piano, L.68\"; \"A Forest\" by The Cure; The Animals' version of \"The House of the Rising Sun\"; Amy Winehouse's \"Back to Black\", and Nine Inch Nails' \"Something I Can Never Have\". Licensing costs ranged from $15,000 to $55,000.\n\nDjawadi said of the series' use of modern songs that \"[\"Westworld\"] has an anachronistic feel to it, it's a Western theme park, and yet it has robots in it, so why not have modern songs? And that's a metaphor in itself, wrapped up in the overall theme of the show\", but credited Nolan with the idea.\n\nThe series premiered its ten-episode first season on October 2, 2016, in North America and Australia, and on October 4, 2016, in the UK and Ireland. The series is broadcast on HBO in the United States, on HBO Canada in Canada, on HBO Latin America in Latin America, in Australia on Showcase, and in the UK and Ireland on Sky Atlantic.\n\nThe second episode was released on HBO in the US on October 7—two days ahead of the episode's announced broadcast date—to avoid competing with the second U.S. presidential debate of 2016.\n\nPrior to the airing of \"Westworld\", HBO held virtual reality exhibits at events like San Diego Comic-Con and Techcrunch Disrupt devoted to \"Westworld: A Delos Destination\". Attendees were allowed to navigate the process by which guests would enter Westworld, and interact with the 3D environment. Made to run on the HTC Vive virtual reality headset, the piece was conceived by showrunners Nolan and Joy. It was designed using Unreal Engine 4, combining computer-generated content and live action 360-degree video. Users received a binary code, permitting access to the website \"DiscoverWestworld.com\" as part of a viral marketing campaign. Visitors were shown a trailer of a fictional travel site, leading them to order a trip to Westworld. A chatbot featured on the website, named Aeden, is available as a Google Assistant action on the smart speaker Google Home.\n\nIn March 2018, to promote \"Westworld's\" second season, HBO constructed a real-life replica of the show's fictional Western \"town\" of Sweetwater during South by Southwest, built on two acres of open land just outside Austin, Texas. Fans took shuttles to the site, which was dressed in the Old West style, with over 60 actors playing the parts of the android \"hosts\".\n\nThe first season of \"Westworld\" (subtitled \"The Maze\") was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on November 7, 2017. It is the first scripted TV series to be released on 4K Blu-ray in the United States. The second season will be released on Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K Blu-ray on December 4, 2018.\n\nReception of the series has been largely positive, with particular praise for its visuals, story, and performances. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 88% based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8.16/10, and an average episode score of 94%. The site's consensus reads \"With an impressive level of quality that honors its source material, the brilliantly addictive \"Westworld\" balances intelligent, enthralling drama against outright insanity.\" On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe editors of \"TV Guide\" placed \"Westworld\" fifth among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016–17 season. In writer Tim Surette's overall review, he notes the perfect concept of blending the western premise into a futuristic setting, saying, \"Well, \"Westworld\" has both, ensuring that it will be an exciting mashup of genres that will disrupt a television landscape that typically says we can only have one or the other.\" He also added, \"The look of the show and its fine cast swing open the saloon doors, but the real treat will be the intelligent discussion of whether or not robots will eventually kill us all. Thankfully, creator Jonathan Nolan already showed us he's the go-to guy for A.I. with \"Person of Interest\".\" Mary McNamara of \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in a lauded review, \"It isn’t just great television, it’s vivid, thought-provoking television that entertains even as it examines the darker side of entertainment.\" For the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", David Wiegand wrote, \"\"Westworld\" isn’t easy to understand at first, but you will be hooked nonetheless by unusually intelligent storytelling, powerful visuals and exceptionally nuanced performances.\" \"Time\"s chief critic Daniel D'Addario wrote, \"Its carefully chosen details add up to a pulp spectacular that’s more thoughtful than any other of this fall’s new dramas.\"\n\nJeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\" also lauded the series and said, \"The depth of \"Westworld\" lies not in asking questions about memory, free will, and what makes us human, but in whether we can become more human than what we let ourselves to be, whether our stories can be richer and more meaningful than what the culture allows.\" Matthew Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" quipped, \"\"Westworld\" has fewer heroes than \"Game of Thrones\", which makes it a bit harder to warm up to, but like a good, thought-provoking puzzle, it is compelling and addictive.\" In a brief review from \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Tim Goodman said, \"Where \"Westworld\" is at its best is in the deeper issues that will unspool slowly, like a good mystery. Early episodes are adept at getting at the base attractions of the park and why people would come, but also in setting up a sense of confusion about motives. ... The series benefits from a number of standout performances.\" Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" wrote, \"The reward, beyond the visual splendors you’ve come to expect from big-budget HBO productions, is a set of characters who grow ever more complex.\" Several other publications wrote positive reviews, including \"Indiewire\", \"The A.V. Club\", \"RogerEbert.com\", \"The New Yorker\", and \"The Atlantic\".\n\nIn a mixed review for \"The New York Times\", chief critic James Poniewozik said, \"It’s an ambitious, if not entirely coherent, sci-fi shoot-’em-up that questions nihilistic entertainment impulses while indulging them.\" Hank Stuever of \"The Washington Post\" also joins Poniewozik saying, \"I'm ... hesitant to write \"Westworld\" off as a dreary trot from start to finish; parts of it are as imaginative and intriguing as anything that’s been on TV recently, particularly in the sci-fi realm,\" and further said, \"It’s definitely not the cyborg \"Deadwood\", that some HBO fans were actively wishing for, nor does it roll out the welcome mat as a riveting, accessible adventure.\" Chief journalist Rob Owen of \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" also critiqued the series less favorably saying, \"It is the definition of a slow-burn series, a program that should be exciting rendered as kind of dull.\" In a less enthusiastic review for \"Variety\", Maureen Ryan said, \"\"Westworld\" looks terrific; its directors have shot its Western locations to stunning effect. But its warmly saturated outdoor scenes and its surface slickness aren’t enough to mask the indecision, condescension, and hollowness at its core.\"\n\nThe second season also received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 86% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.98/10, and an average episode score of 90%. The site's consensus reads \"\"Westworld\" builds on its experimental first season, diving deeper into the human side of AI without losing any of its stylish, bloody glory.\" On Metacritic, the season has a score of 76 out of 100, based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nIn April 2018, after the second-season premiere, \"Variety\" published an article concerning the series' complicated narrative. Andrew Wallenstein wrote, \"\"Westworld\" seems to have too much faith viewers will be willing to absorb storylines that can border on the incomprehensible.\" He also commented about the possible future success of the series, stating, \"There will be a very vocal core fan base willing to do the homework of piecing together the show's many mysteries, but that's not broad enough a base to be the kind of flagship series HBO wants.\"\n\nThe series premiere had viewership numbers slightly less than those for \"True Detective\", but much better than \"Vinyl\", that meant it was seen as \"...off to a relatively promising start...\" Mandy Adams, of iTechPost noted that, \"Emotional reactions on Twitter were estimated to be 545-percent greater compared to the debut of \"Vinyl\" and 326-percent higher than the latest \"The Leftovers\" season.\" The U.S. series premiere attracted 1.96 million viewers, with 0.8 million in the advertiser-coveted 18-to-49-year-old demographic. The premiere episode received 3.3 million viewers for its three Sunday night airings as well as on HBO's streaming platforms. The season one finale received 2.2 million viewers for its initial broadcast, and increased to 3.5 million including replays and on-demand viewing. The first season had an average cumulative viewership of 12 million viewers, making it the most-watched first season of an HBO series, and TorrentFreak gauged \"Westworld\" as the third most-torrented television show of 2016.\n\"Westworld\" has been nominated for 43 Emmy Awards, 3 Golden Globe Awards, 2 Satellite Awards, 4 Critics' Choice Television Awards, and 2 Writers Guild of America Awards.\n\n"}

It involves holding stretches as a kind of low-impact physical exercise, and is often used for therapeutic purposes. Yoga in this sense often occurs in a class and may involve meditation, imagery, breath work and music.\n\nYoga has roots in India. The foundational text for yoga is the \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\". Yoga came to the attention of the western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Hindu philosophy. The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience was Swami Vivekananda, who toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s.\n\nNearly all types of hatha yoga practices include asana, pranayama and savasana. The physical asanas of hatha yoga have a tradition that goes back to at least the 15th century, but they were not widely practiced in India prior to the early 20th century.\n\nA hatha \"yoga boom\" occurred in the 1980s, as unconnected to a religious denomination. Since then, hatha yoga has been used as a supplementary exercise practice.\n\nThe more classical approaches of hatha yoga, such as iyengar yoga, move at a more deliberate pace, emphasize proper alignment and execution and hold asanas for a longer time. They aim to gradually improve flexibility, balance, and strength. Other approaches, such as Ashtanga or power yoga, shift between asanas quickly and energetically. Contemporary approaches to yoga invite students to become their own authority in yoga practice by offering principle-based approaches to yoga that can be applied to any form.\n\nMuch of the research on hatha yoga has been in the form of preliminary studies or clinical trials of low methodological quality, including small sample sizes, inadequate blinding, lack of randomization, and high risk of bias. Hatha yoga does not have specific standardization of its practice.\n\nA 2010 literature review stated, \"although the results from these trials are encouraging, they should be viewed as very preliminary because the trials, as a group, suffered from substantial methodological limitations.\" A 2015 systematic review on the effect of yoga on mood and the brain concluded that \"yoga is associated with better regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, as well as a decrease in depressive and anxious symptoms in a range of populations.\" The same review recommended more methodological rigor be applied to future clinical trials.\n\nOne review found little evidence that yoga helps people with dementia perform their daily activities, while another showed there were no effects on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There was weak evidence supporting yoga as an alternative treatment for insomnia, with no evidence that yoga was better than general relaxation.\n\nOnly weak evidence was found to support the use of hatha yoga as a complementary therapy for rheumatic diseases, with no evidence of its safety. Although one study found a small effect of yoga to lower high blood pressure, overall this evidence was too weak for any recommendation to be made, and provided no information about safety. There was no evidence of benefit in treatment of epilepsy or menopause-related symptoms. Practice of yoga had no effect on the underlying mechanisms of cancer.\n\nAlthough relatively safe, yoga is not risk free. Sensible precautions can usefully be taken – for example beginners should avoid advanced moves, yoga should not be combined with psychoactive drug use, and competitive yoga should be avoided.\n\nA small percentage of yoga practitioners each year suffer physical injuries analogous to sports injuries. The practice of yoga has been cited as a cause of hyperextension or rotation of the neck, which may be a precipitating factor in cervical artery dissection.\n\n"}

{"id": "199910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199910", "title": "Émile Littré", "text": "Émile Littré\n\nÉmile Maximilien Paul Littré (; 1 February 1801 – 2 June 1881) was a French lexicographer, freemason and philosopher, best known for his \"Dictionnaire de la langue française\", commonly called \"The Littré\".\n\nLittré was born in Paris. His father, Michel-François Littré, had been a gunner and, later, a sergeant-major of marine artillery in the French navy who was deeply imbued with revolutionary ideas of the day. Settling down as a tax collector, he married Sophie Johannot, a free-thinker like himself, and devoted himself to the education of his son Émile. The boy was sent to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where Louis Hachette and Eugène Burnouf became his friends. After he completed his studies at the lycée, he was undecided as to what career he should adopt; however, he devoted himself to mastering the English and German languages, classical and Sanskrit literature, and philology.\n\nHe finally decided to become a student of medicine in 1822. He passed all his examinations in due course, and had only his thesis to prepare in order to obtain his degree as doctor when, in 1827, his father died leaving his mother without means. He abandoned his degree at once despite his keen interest in medicine, and, while attending lectures by Pierre Rayer, began teaching Latin and Greek to earn a living. He served as a soldier for the populists during the July Revolution of 1830, and was one of the members of the National Guard who followed Charles X to Rambouillet. In 1831, he obtained an introduction to Armand Carrel, the editor of \"Le National\", who gave him the task of reading English and German papers for excerpts. By chance, in 1835, Carrel discovered Littré's skills as a writer and from that time on, he was a constant contributor to the journal, eventually becoming its director.\n\nIn 1836, Littré began to contribute articles on a wide range of subjects to the \"Revue des deux mondes\", and in 1837, he married. In 1839, the first volume of his complete works of Hippocrates appeared in print. Due to the outstanding quality of this work, he was elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in the same year. He noticed the works of Auguste Comte, the reading of which formed, as he himself said, \"the cardinal point of his life.\" From this time forward, the influence of positivism affected his own life, and, what is of more importance, he influenced positivism, giving as much to this philosophy as he received from it. He soon became a friend of Comte, and popularised his ideas in numerous works on the positivist philosophy. He continued translating and publishing his edition of Hippocrates' writings, which was not completed until 1862, and he published a similar edition of Pliny's \"Natural History\". After 1844, he took Fauriel's place on the committee engaged to produce the \"Histoire littéraire de la France\", where his knowledge of the early French language and literature was invaluable.\nLittré started work on his great \"Dictionnaire de la langue française\" in about 1844, which was not to be completed until thirty years later. He participated in the revolution of July 1848, and in the repression of the extreme Republican Party in June 1849. His essays, contributed during this period to the \"National\", were collected together and published under the title of \"Conservation, revolution et positivisme\" in 1852, and show a thorough acceptance of all the doctrines propounded by Comte. However, during the later years of his master's life, he began to perceive that he could not wholly accept all the dogmas or the more mystic ideas of his friend and master. He concealed his differences of opinion, and Comte failed to recognise that his pupil had outgrown him, as he himself had outgrown his master Henri de Saint-Simon.\n\nComte's death in 1858 freed Littré from any fear of alienating his master. He published his own ideas in his \"Paroles de la philosophie positive\" in 1859. Four years later, in a work of greater length, he published \"Auguste Comte et la philosophie positive\", which traces the origin of Comte's ideas through Turgot, Kant, and Saint-Simon. The work eulogises Comte's own life, his method of philosophy, his great services to the cause and the effect of his works, and proceeds to show where he himself differs from him. He approved wholly of Comte's philosophy, his great laws of society and his philosophical method, which indeed he defended warmly against John Stuart Mill. However, he stated that, while he believed in a positivist philosophy, he did not believe in a \"religion of humanity\".\n\nAbout 1863, after completing his translations of Hippocrates and his Pliny, he began work in earnest on his great French dictionary. He was invited to join the Académie française, but declined, not wishing to associate himself with Félix Dupanloup, bishop of Orléans, who had denounced him as the head of the French materialists in his \"Avertissement aux pères de famille\". At this time, he also started \"La Revue de philosophie positive\" with Grégoire Wyrouboff, a magazine that embodied the views of modern positivists.\nThus, his life was absorbed in literary work until the events that overthrew the Second Empire called him to take a part in politics. He felt himself too old to undergo the privations of the Siege of Paris, and retired with his family to Brittany. He was summoned by Gambetta to Bordeaux to lecture on history, and thence to Versailles to take his seat in the senate to which he had been chosen by the \"département\" of the Seine. In December 1871, he was elected a member of the Académie française in spite of the renewed opposition of Msgr. Dupanloup, who resigned his seat rather than receive him.\n\nLittré's \"Dictionnaire de la langue française\" (\"Dictionary of the French Language\") was completed in 1873 after nearly 30 years of work. The draft was written on 415,636 sheets, bundled in packets of one thousand, stored in eight white wooden crates that filled the cellar of Littré's home in Mesnil-le-Roi. The landmark effort gave authoritative definitions and usage descriptions to every word based on the various meanings it had held in the past. When it was published by Hachette, it was the largest lexicographical work on the French language at that time.\n\nIn 1875, he applied for membership in the Masonic Lodge \"La Clémente Amitié\" (\"Grand Orient de France\"). When asked whether he believed in the existence of a supreme being in the presence of 1000 Freemasons, he replied: \n\nIn 1874, Littré was elected Senator for life of the Third Republic. His most notable writings during these years were his political papers that attacked and revealed the confederacy of the Orléanists and Legitimists against the Republic; his re-editions of many of his old articles and books, among others the \"Conservation, révolution et positivisme\" of 1852 (which he reprinted word for word, appending a formal, categorical renunciation of many of the Comtist doctrines therein contained); and a little tract, \"Pour la dernière fois\", in which he maintained his unalterable belief in the philosophy of Materialism.\n\nWhen it became obvious that the old man would not live much longer, his wife and daughter, who had always been fervent Catholics, strove to convert him to their religion. He had long discussions with Father Louis Millériot, a celebrated Controversialist, and Abbé Henri Huvelin, the noted priest of Église Saint-Augustin, who were much grieved at his death. When Littré was near death, he converted, was baptised by the abbé and his funeral was conducted with the rites of the Roman Catholic Church. Littré is interred at Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
