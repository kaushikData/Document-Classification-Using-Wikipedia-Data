O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He later returned to Calvin College to become the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy.\n\nA prominent Christian philosopher, Plantinga served as president of the Society of Christian Philosophers from 1983-86. He has delivered the Gifford Lectures two times and was described by \"TIME\" magazine as \"America's leading orthodox Protestant philosopher of God\". William Lane Craig wrote in his work \"Reasonable Faith\" that he considers Plantinga to be the greatest Christian philosopher alive. A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2017.\n\nSome of Plantinga's most influential works including \"God and Other Minds\" (1967), \"The Nature of Necessity\" (1974), and a trilogy of books on epistemology, culminating in \"Warranted Christian Belief\" (2000) that was simplified in \"Knowledge and Christian Belief\" (2016).\n\nPlantinga was born on November 15, 1932, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Cornelius A. Plantinga (1908–1994) and Lettie G. Bossenbroek (1908–2007). Plantinga's father was a first-generation immigrant, born in the Netherlands. His family is from the Dutch province of Friesland, they lived on a relatively low income until he secured a teaching job in Michigan in 1941.\n\nPlantinga's father earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from Duke University and a master's degree in psychology, and taught several academic subjects at different colleges over the years\n\nPlantinga married Kathleen De Boer in 1955. They have four children: Carl, Jane, Harry, and Ann. Both of his sons are professors at Calvin College, Carl in Film Studies and Harry in computer science. Harry is also the director of the college's Christian Classics Ethereal Library. Plantinga's older daughter, Jane Plantinga Pauw, is a pastor at Rainier Beach Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) in Seattle, Washington, and his younger daughter, Ann Kapteyn, is a missionary in Cameroon working for Wycliffe Bible Translators.\nHis granddaughter Natasha Pauw lives at home with her parents.\nOne of Plantinga's brothers, Cornelius \"Neal\" Plantinga Jr., is a theologian and the former president of Calvin Theological Seminary. Another of his brothers, Leon, is an emeritus professor of musicology at Yale University. His brother Terrell worked for CBS News.\n\nAfter Plantinga completed 11th grade, his father urged him to skip his last year of high school and immediately enroll in college. Plantinga reluctantly followed his father's advice and in 1949, a few months before his 17th birthday, he enrolled in Jamestown College, in Jamestown, North Dakota. During that same year, his father accepted a teaching job at Calvin College, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In January 1950, Plantinga moved to Grand Rapids with his family and enrolled in Calvin College. During his first semester at Calvin, Plantinga was awarded a scholarship to attend Harvard University.\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1950, Plantinga spent two semesters at Harvard. In 1951, during Harvard's spring recess, Plantinga attended a few philosophy classes at Calvin College, and was so impressed with Calvin philosophy professor William Harry Jellema that he returned in 1951 to study philosophy under him. In 1954, Plantinga began his graduate studies at the University of Michigan where he studied under William Alston, William Frankena, and Richard Cartwright, among others. A year later, in 1955, he transferred to Yale University where he received his Ph.D. in 1958.\n\nPlantinga began his career as an instructor in the philosophy department at Yale in 1957, and then in 1958 he became a professor of philosophy at Wayne State University during its heyday as a major center for analytic philosophy. In 1963, he accepted a teaching job at Calvin College, where he replaced the retiring Jellema. He then spent the next 19 years at Calvin before moving to the University of Notre Dame in 1982. He retired from the University of Notre Dame in 2010 and returned to Calvin College, where he serves as the first holder of the William Harry Jellema Chair in Philosophy. He has trained many prominent philosophers working in metaphysics and epistemology including Michael Bergmann at Purdue and Michael Rea at Notre Dame, and Trenton Merricks working at University of Virginia.\n\nPlantinga served as president of the American Philosophical Association, Western Division, 1981–82. and as President of the Society of Christian Philosophers 1983–86.\n\nHe has honorary degrees from Glasgow University (1982), Calvin College (1986), North Park College (1994), the Free University of Amsterdam (1995), Brigham Young University (1996), and Valparaiso University (1999). He was a Guggenheim Fellow, 1971–72, and elected a Fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975.\n\nIn 2006, the University of Notre Dame's Center for Philosophy of Religion renamed its Distinguished Scholar Fellowship as the Alvin Plantinga Fellowship. The fellowship includes an annual lecture by the current Plantinga Fellow.\n\nIn 2012, the University of Pittsburgh's Philosophy Department, History and Philosophy of Science Department, and the Center for the History and Philosophy of Science co-awarded Plantinga the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy, which he received with a talk titled, \"Religion and Science: Where the Conflict Really Lies\".\n\nIn 2017, Baylor University's Center for Christian Philosophy inaugurated the Alvin Plantinga Award for Excellence in Christian Philosophy. Awardees deliver a lecture at Baylor University and their name is put on a plaque with Plantinga's image in the Institute for Studies in Religion. He was named the first fellow of the center as well.\n\nHe was awarded the 2017 Templeton Prize.\n\nPlantinga has argued that some people can know that God exists as a basic belief, requiring no argument. He developed this argument in two different fashions: firstly, in \"God and Other Minds\" (1967), by drawing an equivalence between the teleological argument and the common sense view that people have of other minds existing by analogy with their own minds. Plantinga has also developed a more comprehensive epistemological account of the nature of warrant which allows for the existence of God as a basic belief.\n\nPlantinga has also argued that there is no logical inconsistency between the existence of evil and the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, wholly good God.\n\nPlantinga proposed a \"free will defense\" in a volume edited by Max Black in 1965, which attempts to refute the logical problem of evil, the argument that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God. Plantinga's argument (in a truncated form) states that \"It is possible that God, even being omnipotent, could not create a world with free creatures who never choose evil. Furthermore, it is possible that God, even being omnibenevolent, would desire to create a world which contains evil if moral goodness requires free moral creatures.\"\n\nHowever, the argument's handling of natural evil has been more heavily disputed, and its presupposition of a libertarianist, incompatibilist view of free will has been seen as problematic as well. According to the \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", the argument also \"conflicts with important theistic doctrines\", including the notion of heaven and the idea that God has free will. J. L. Mackie sees Plantinga's free-will defense as incoherent.\n\nPlantinga's well-received book \"God, Freedom and Evil\", written in 1974, gave his response to what he saw as the incomplete and uncritical view of theism's criticism of theodicy. Plantinga's contribution stated that when the issue of a comprehensive doctrine of freedom is added to the discussion of the goodness of God and the omnipotence of God then it is not possible to exclude the presence of evil in the world after introducing freedom into the discussion. Plantinga's own summary occurs in his discussion titled \"Could God Have Created a World Containing Moral Good but No Moral Evil\", where he states his conclusion that, \"... the price for creating a world in which they produce moral good is creating one in which they also produce moral evil.\"\n\nPlantinga's contributions to epistemology include an argument which he dubs \"Reformed epistemology\". According to Reformed epistemology, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is properly basic, and due to a religious externalist epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called \"proper functionalism\", is a form of epistemological reliabilism.\n\nPlantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, \"Warrant: The Current Debate\", Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of Chisholm, BonJour, Alston, Goldman, and others. In the book, Plantinga argues specifically that the theories of what he calls \"warrant\"-what many others have called justification (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a property of a person holding a belief while warrant is a property of a belief)—put forth by these epistemologists have systematically failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.\n\nIn the second book, \"Warrant and Proper Function\", he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability. Plantinga's \"proper function\" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's \"belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers\" are functioning properly—\"working the way it ought to work\". Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a \"design plan\", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: \"it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans\", but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological naturalism- i.e. epistemology that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties—is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics—in this case the belief in a creator God or designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.\n\nAccording to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:\n\n(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.\n\nPlantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as \"naturalistic\", including the \"functional generalization\" view of John Pollock, the evolutionary/etiological account provided by Ruth Millikan, and a dispositional view held by John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter. Plantinga also discusses his evolutionary argument against naturalism in the later chapters of \"Warrant and Proper Function\".\n\nIn 2000, the third volume, \"Warranted Christian Belief\", was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the \"A/C\" (Aquinas/Calvin) model, and the \"Extended A/C\" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that specifically Christian theological beliefs including the Trinity, the Incarnation, the resurrection of Christ, the atonement, salvation etc. Under this model, Christians are justified in their beliefs because of the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.\n\nJames Beilby has argued that the purpose of Plantinga's \"Warrant\" trilogy, and specifically of his \"Warranted Christian Belief\", is firstly to make a form of argument against religion impossible—namely, the argument that whether or not Christianity is true, it is irrational—so \"the skeptic would have to shoulder the formidable task of demonstrating the falsity of Christian belief\" rather than simply dismiss it as irrational. In addition, Plantinga is attempting to provide a philosophical explanation of how Christians should think about their own Christian belief.\n\nPlantinga has expressed a modal logic version of the ontological argument in which he uses modal logic to develop, in a more rigorous and formal way, Norman Malcolm's and Charles Hartshorne's modal ontological arguments.\n\nPlantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, and offered an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the necessary existence of the greatest possible being, it follows that there is a being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in \"some\" worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve this problem, Plantinga differentiated between \"greatness\" and \"excellence\". A being's excellence in a particular world depends only on its properties in that world; a being's greatness depends on its properties in all worlds. Therefore, the greatest possible being must have maximal excellence in every possible world. Plantinga then restated Malcolm's argument, using the concept of \"maximal greatness\". He argued that it is possible for a being with maximal greatness to exist, so a being with maximal greatness exists in a possible world. If this is the case, then a being with maximal greatness exists in every world, and therefore in this world.\n\nThe conclusion relies on a form of modal axiom S5, which states that if something is possibly true, then its possibility is necessary (it is possibly true in all worlds). Plantinga's version of S5 suggests that \"To say that p is possibly necessarily true is to say that, with regard to one world, it is true at all worlds; but in that case it is true at all worlds, and so it is simply necessary.\" A version of his argument is as follows:\n\n\nPlantinga argued that, although the first premise is not rationally established, it is not contrary to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first premise is contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies of the argument, suggesting that the existence of anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga's argument, provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world.\n\nAnother Christian apologist, William Lane Craig, characterizes Plantinga's argument in a slightly different way:\nAccording to Craig, premises (2)–(5) are relatively uncontroversial among philosophers, but \"the epistemic entertainability of premise (1) (or its denial) does not guarantee its metaphysical possibility.\" Furthermore, Richard M. Gale argued that premise three, the \"possibility premise\", begs the question. He stated that one only has the epistemic right to accept the premise if one understands the nested modal operators, and that if one understands them within the system S5—without which the argument fails—then one understands that \"possibly necessarily\" is in essence the same as \"necessarily\". Thus the premise begs the question because the conclusion is embedded within it.\nOn S5 systems in general, James Garson writes that \"the words ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’, have many different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal logic depends on which of these uses we have in mind.\"\n\nIn Plantinga's evolutionary argument against naturalism, he argues that if evolution is true, it undermines naturalism. His basic argument is that if evolution and naturalism are both true, human cognitive faculties evolved to produce beliefs that have survival value (maximizing one's success at the four F's: \"feeding, fleeing, fighting, and reproducing\"), not necessarily to produce beliefs that are true. Thus, since human cognitive faculties are tuned to survival rather than truth in the naturalism-evolution model, there is reason to doubt the veracity of the products of those same faculties, including naturalism and evolution themselves. On the other hand, if God created man \"in his image\" by way of an evolutionary process (or any other means), then Plantinga argues our faculties would probably be reliable.\n\nThe argument does not assume any necessary correlation (or uncorrelation) between true beliefs and survival. Making the contrary assumption—that there is in fact a relatively strong correlation between truth and survival—if human belief-forming apparatus evolved giving a survival advantage, then it ought to yield truth since true beliefs confer a survival advantage. Plantinga counters that, while there may be overlap between true beliefs and beliefs that contribute to survival, the two kinds of beliefs are not the same, and he gives the following example with a man named Paul:\n\nThe argument has received favorable notice from Thomas Nagel, William Lane Craig, but has also been criticized as seriously flawed, for example by Elliott Sober\n\nEven though Alvin Plantinga believes that God could have used Darwinian processes to create the world, he stands firm against philosophical naturalism. He said in an interview on the relationship between science and religion that: \n\nReligion and science share more common ground than you might think, though science can't prove, it presupposes that there has been a past for example, science does not cover the whole of the knowledge enterprise.\n\nPlantinga participated of groups that support the Intelligent Design Movement, and was a member of the 'Ad Hoc Origins Committee' that supported Philip E. Johnson's 1991 book \"Darwin on Trial\", he also provided a back-cover endorsement of Johnson's book:\n\nShows how Darwinian evolution has become an idol. \n\nHe was a Fellow of the (now moribund) pro-intelligent design International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design, and has presented at a number of intelligent design conferences. In a March 2010 article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", philosopher of science Michael Ruse labeled Plantinga as an \"open enthusiast of intelligent design\". In a letter to the editor, Plantinga made the following response:\nLike any Christian (and indeed any theist), I believe that the world has been created by God, and hence \"intelligently designed\". The hallmark of intelligent design, however, is the claim that this can be shown scientifically; I'm dubious about that.\n\n...As far as I can see, God certainly could have used Darwinian processes to create the living world and direct it as he wanted to go; hence evolution as such does not imply that there is no direction in the history of life. What does have that implication is not evolutionary theory itself, but \"unguided\" evolution, the idea that neither God nor any other person has taken a hand in guiding, directing or orchestrating the course of evolution. But the scientific theory of evolution, sensibly enough, says nothing one way or the other about divine guidance. It doesn't say that evolution is divinely guided; it also doesn't say that it isn't. Like almost any theist, I reject unguided evolution; but the contemporary scientific theory of evolution just as such—apart from philosophical or theological add-ons—doesn't say that evolution is unguided. Like science in general, it makes no pronouncements on the existence or activity of God.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35950757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35950757", "title": "Apophantic", "text": "Apophantic\n\nApophantic (, \"declaratory\", from ἀποφαίνειν \"apophainein\", \"to show, to make known\") is a term Aristotle coined to mean a specific type of declaratory statement that can determine the truth or falsity of a logical proposition or phenomenon. It was adopted by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger as part of phenomenology. Marcuse defines it as \"the logic of judgment\".\n\nIn Aristotle's usage, the Greek term ἀποφαντικὸς λόγος (apophantic speech) describes a statement that, by examining a proposition in itself, can determine what is true about a statement by establishing whether or not the predicate of a sentence may logically be attributed to its subject. For example, logical propositions may be divided into ones that are semantically determinate, as in the sentence \"All penguins are birds,\" and those that are semantically indeterminate, as in the sentence \"All bachelors are unhappy.\" In the first proposition, the subject is \"penguins\" and the predicate is \"birds\", and the set of all birds is a category into which the subject of penguins should necessarily be put. In the second proposition, the subject is \"bachelors\" and the predicate is \"unhappy\". This is a subjective, contingent connection that does not necessarily follow. An apophantic conclusion would, by examining the two statements—and not any evidence supporting or denying them—make a judgment between them that identifies \"All penguins are birds\" as more truthful than \"All bachelors are unhappy.\" One would reach this conclusion simply because of the propositions' nature, and not because any penguins or bachelors had been consulted.\n\nIn phenomenology, Martin Heidegger argues that apophantic judgements are the most reliable means of obtaining truth, as they do not rely upon subjective comparisons. Before Heidegger, however, his former teacher Husserl had already centralized the role of apophantic judgment in his phenomenological 'transcendental logic', during the course lectures on passive synthesis in the mid 1920s.\n\nThe concept appears in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition as \"jâzim\", or 'truth-apt'.\n\n"}
{"id": "4448502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4448502", "title": "Boundary-work", "text": "Boundary-work\n\nIn science studies, boundary-work comprises instances in which boundaries, demarcations, or other divisions between fields of knowledge are created, advocated, attacked, or reinforced. Academic scholarship on boundary-work has emphasized that such delineations often have high stakes involved for the participants, and carries with it the implication that such boundaries are flexible and socially constructed.\n\nThe original use of the term \"boundary-work\" for these sorts of issues has been attributed to Thomas F. Gieryn, a sociologist, who initially used it to discuss the problem of demarcation, the philosophical difficulty of coming up with a rigorous delineation between what is \"science\" and what is \"non-science\".\n\nGieryn defined boundary-work as the \"attribution of selected characteristics to [an] institution of science (i.e., to its practitioners, methods, stock of knowledge, values and work organization) for purposes of constructing a social boundary that distinguishes some intellectual activities as [outside that boundary].\" Philosophers and sociologists of science, such as Karl Popper and Robert K. Merton, long struggled to come up with a criterion which would distinguish science as unique from other knowledge-generating activities, but never were able to come up with one that was stable, transhistorical, or worked reliably.\n\nGieryn's 1983 paper on boundary-work and demarcation emphasized that the very discussions of demarcation between science and non-science were \"ideological\"; that there were strong stakes for scientists to erect such boundaries both in arguing for their own objectivity and the need for autonomy.\n\nGieryn looked specifically at instances of boundary-work in 19th-century Britain, in which scientists attempted to characterize the relationship between religion and science as one of sharp distinction, and also looked at instances in which scientists attempted to argue that science and politics and/or ideology were inherently separate as well. Many other works by sociologists and historians have since looked at boundary-work in many other situations, usually focusing on the rhetoric of scientists (or their opponents) and their interpersonal and intersocial interactions.\n\nStudies in boundary-work have also focused on how individual scientific disciplines are created. Following the work of Pierre Bourdieu on the \"scientific field\", many have looked at ways in which certain \"objects\" are able to bridge the erected boundaries because they satisfy the needs of multiple social groups (boundary objects).\n\nAn example of such boundary-work can be found in the study of science and literature. One instance of these studies is Aldous Huxley's book Literature and Science (see also Edward M. Jennings's (Ed.)1970 \"Science and Literature: New Lenses for Criticism\", Anchor Books and Harry Raphael Garvin and James M. Heath's \"Science and Literature\", Bucknell University Press)\n\nAnother example of boundary-work occurred when individual scientists and scientific institutions published statements responding to the allegations of scientific fraud during the \"Climategate\" episode (Ramírez-i-Ollé, 2015). \n\n\n"}
{"id": "297220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297220", "title": "Buddhism in Japan", "text": "Buddhism in Japan\n\nBuddhism in Japan has been practiced since its official introduction in 552 CE according to the \"Nihon Shoki\" from Baekje, Korea, by Buddhist monks. Buddhism has had a major influence on the development of Japanese society and remains an influential aspect of the culture to this day.\n\nIn modern times, Japan's most popular schools of Buddhism are Pure Land Buddhism, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon Buddhism and Zen. As of 2008, approximately 34% of the Japanese identify as Buddhists and the number has been growing since the 1980s, in terms of membership in organized religion. However, in terms of practice, 75% practice some form of Buddhism (compared with 90% practicing Shinto, thus most Japanese practice both religions to some extent (Shinbutsu-shūgō)). About 60% of the Japanese have a Butsudan (Buddhist shrine) in their homes.\n\nThe arrival of Buddhism in China is ultimately a consequence of the first contacts between China and Central Asia, where Buddhism had spread from the Indian subcontinent. These contacts occurred with the opening of the Silk Road in the 2nd century BCE, following the travels of Zhang Qian between 138 and 126 BCE. These contacts culminated with the official introduction of Buddhism in China in 67 CE. Historians generally agree that by the middle of the 1st century, the religion had penetrated to areas north of the Huai River in China.\n\nAccording to the \"Book of Liang\", which was written in 635, five Buddhist monks from Gandhara traveled to Japan in 467. At the time, they referred to Japan as Fusang (), the name of a mythological country to the extreme east beyond the sea:\nAlthough there are records of Buddhist monks from China coming to Japan before the Asuka Period, the \"official\" introduction of Buddhism to Japan is dated to 552 in \"Nihon Shoki\" when King Seong of Baekje (聖明王, now western Korea) sent a mission to the Emperor Kinmei that included Buddhist monks or nuns together with an image of Buddha and a number of sutras to introduce Buddhism. The powerful Soga clan played a key role in the early spread of Buddhism in the country. Initial uptake of the new faith was slow, and Buddhism only started to spread some years later when Empress Suiko openly encouraged the acceptance of Buddhism among all Japanese people.\n\nAccording to legend, in Japan in 552, there was an attempt to destroy a tooth relic, one of the first of Buddha’s to arrive in the country; it was hit by a hammer into an anvil; the hammer and anvil were destroyed but the tooth was not. On January 15, 593, Soga no Umako ordered relics of Buddha deposited inside the foundation stone under the pillar of a pagoda at Asuka-dera.\n\nIn 607, in order to obtain copies of sutras, an imperial envoy was dispatched to Sui China. As time progressed and the number of Buddhist clergy increased, the offices of \"Sōjō\" (archbishop) and \"Sōzu\" (bishop) were created. By 627, there were 46 Buddhist temples, 816 Buddhist priests, and 569 Buddhist nuns in Japan.\n\nThe initial period saw the six great Chinese schools, called in Japanese were introduced to the Japanese archipelago:\n\nThese schools were centered around the ancient capitals of Asuka and Nara, where great temples such as the Asuka-dera and Tōdai-ji were erected respectively. These were not exclusive schools, and temples were apt to have scholars versed in several of the schools. It has been suggested that they can best be thought of as \"study groups\". The Buddhism of these periods, known as the Asuka period and Nara period – was not a practical religion, being more the domain of learned priests whose official function was to pray for the peace and prosperity of the state and imperial house. This kind of Buddhism had little to offer to the illiterate and uneducated masses and led to the growth of \"people’s priests\" who were not ordained and had no formal Buddhist training. Their practice was a combination of Buddhist and Daoist elements and the incorporation of shamanistic features of indigenous practices. Some of these figures became immensely popular and were a source of criticism towards the sophisticated academic and bureaucratic Buddhism of the capital.\n\nThe Late Nara period saw the introduction of Tangmi (Esoteric Buddhism, Japanese \"mikkyō\") to Japan from China by Kūkai and Saichō, who founded Shingon Buddhism and the Tendai school, respectively.\n\nDuring the Heian period the capital was shifted from Nara to Kyoto. Monasteries became centers of powers, even establishing armies of Sōhei, warrior-monks.\n\nShinto and Buddhism became the dominant religions, maintaining a balance until the Meiji-restoration.\n\nThe Kamakura period was a period of crisis in which the control of the country moved from the imperial aristocracy to the samurai. In 1185 the Kamakura shogunate was established at Kamakura.\n\nThis period saw the introduction of the two schools that had perhaps the greatest impact on the country: the schools of Pure Land Buddhism, promulgated by evangelists such as Genshin and articulated by monks such as Hōnen, which emphasize salvation through faith in Amitābha and remain the largest Buddhist sect in Japan (and throughout Asia); and Zen, promulgated by monks such as Eisai and Dōgen, which emphasize liberation through the insight of meditation, which were equally rapidly adopted by the upper classes and had a profound impact on the culture of Japan.\n\nAdditionally, it was during the Kamakura period that the influential monk Nichiren began teaching devotion to the \"Lotus Sutra\". Eventually, his disciples formed their own school of Nichiren Buddhism, which includes various sects that have their own interpretations of Nichiren's teachings. Nichiren Buddhism established the foundation of Japanese Buddhism in the thirteenth century. The school is known for its sociopolitical activism and looks to reform society through faith.\n\nIn the Muromachi period, Zen, particularly the Rinzai school, obtained the help of the Ashikaga shogunate and the Emperor of Japan, and accomplished considerable development.\n\nAfter the Sengoku period of war, Japan was re-united in the Azuchi–Momoyama period. This decreased the power of Buddhism, which had become a strong political and military force in Japan. Neo-Confucianism and Shinto gained influence at the expense of Buddhism, which came under strict state control. Japan closed itself off to the rest of the world. The only traders to be allowed were Dutchmen admitted to the island of Dejima.\n\nNew doctrines and methods were not to be introduced, nor were new temples and schools. The only exception was the Ōbaku lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the Edo period by Ingen, a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the Linji school, the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Manchu people, his teachings were seen as a separate school. The Ōbaku school was named after Mount Huangbo (), which had been Ingen's home in China. Also notable during the period was the publication of an exceptionally high quality reprint of the Ming-era \"Tripiṭaka\" by Tetsugen Doko, a renowned master of the Ōbaku school.\n\nWith the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the new government adopted a strong anti-Buddhist attitude, and a movement to eradicate Buddhism and bring Shinto to ascendancy arose throughout the country due to the strong connections of Buddhism to the Shōguns.\n\nDuring the Meiji period (1868–1912), after a coup in 1868, Japan abandoned its feudal system and opened up to Western modernism. Shinto became the state religion. Within the Buddhist establishment the Western world was seen as a threat as well as a challenge to stand up to. Buddhist institutions had a simple choice: adapt or perish. Rinzai and Soto Zen chose to adapt, trying to modernize Zen in accord with Western insights, while simultaneously maintaining a Japanese identity. Other schools, and Buddhism in general, simply saw their influence wane.\nThe edict of April 1872 ended the status of the Buddhist precepts as state law and allowed monks to marry and to eat meat. This \"codification of a secularized lifestyle for the monk coupled with the revival of the emperor system and development of State Shinto were fundamental in desacralizing Buddhism and pushing it to the margins of society\".\n\nJapanese identity was being articulated in Nihonjinron, the \"Japanese uniqueness theory\". A broad range of subjects was taken as typical of Japanese culture. D. T. Suzuki contributed to the Nihonjinron by taking Zen as the distinctive token of Asian spirituality, showing its unique character in the Japanese culture. Nichirenism was one particular expression of Japanese Buddhist nationalism.\n\nDuring World War II, almost all Buddhists temples strongly supported Japan's militarization.\nIn contrast, a few individuals such as Ichikawa Haku, and Girō Seno’o were targeted, and the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai, a Nichiren lay believers' organization, was ultimately banned by military authorities. During the 1940s, \"leaders of both Honmon Hokkeshu and Sokka Gakkai were imprisoned for their defiance of wartime government religious policy, which mandated display of reverence for state Shinto.\"\n\nPost World War II, there was a high demand for Buddhist priests who glorified fallen soldiers, and gave funerals and posthumous names, causing a strong revival. However, due to secularization and the growth of materialism, Buddhism and religion in general continued to decline.\n\nJapan has seen a growth in post war movements of lay believers of Buddhism and a decline in traditional Buddhism in the 20th century, with roughly 100 Buddhist organizations disappearing every year. As of 2008 approximately 34% of the Japanese identify as \"Buddhists\" and the number has been growing since the 1980s, as Buddhists were 27% in 1984.\n\nStill, around 90% of Japanese funerals are conducted according to Buddhist rites. \"In 1963 Tamamuro Taijo coined the term \"Funeral Buddhism\" that came to be used to describe traditional Buddhism in Japan as the religion engaged in funerary rites and removed from the spiritual needs of people\".\n\nContrary to the ritualistic practice of traditional Buddhism, a revived modern form of Nichiren Buddhism led by lay believers Soka Gakkai \"...grew rapidly in the chaos of post war Japan from about 3000 members in 1951 to over 8 million members\" in 2000, and has established schools, colleges and a university, as well as cultural institutions. A study about the reason for the growth in lay believers and increased engagement in society attributes the cause to Nichiren teachings of 'social responsibility': \"In the tradition of Nichiren Buddhism, however, we find the Lotus Sutra linked to a view of social responsibility that is distinctive\". According to an academic study, lay believers of Buddhism \"...offer an alternative view of Japan where their form of Buddhism would form the religious foundation of a peaceful and psychologically and materially enriched society\".\n\n[\"East Asian Buddhism is very diverse in its teachings and monastic practices, and Japanese Buddhism, in particular, represents almost every strand of Buddhist teachings and practices. However, in comparison to Chinese or Korean Buddhist schools that are generally more united and less sectarian in their groupings, Buddhist denominations in Japan have developed into independent sects with autonomous organizations that have differing emphases on the doctrine and separate lay followings.\" (Authors: Kawananami, Partridg, and Woodhead page 82.)]In the post-Meiji, pre-WWII period, there were officially 13 schools and 56 branches () of traditional Buddhism (i.e., those not established in modern times). The official schools included three from the Nara period, two from the Heian period (Tendai and Shingon), four Pure Land schools, three Zen schools (Rinzai, Sōtō and Ōbaku), and Nichiren. During the war, this was halved to 28 branches, but the law enforcing this was repealed following the end of the war, allowing former branches to return. Further, since then, many groups have split off from existing branches.\n\n625: Introduced into Japan.\nThe (formerly known as the *\"Sātyasiddhi\") is considered to be an offshoot of the Bahuśrutīya, an Indian Sautrāntika school of Nikaya Buddhism; however, the \"Tattvasiddhi\"s position was also close to that of the Sthavira nikāya. They were distinguished by a rejection of abhidharma as not being the words of the Buddha. It was introduced to Japan as Jōjitsu in 625 by the monk Ekwan of Goryeo. In Japan, it was classified as one of the three approaches of East Asian Mādhyamaka instead of a separate lineage. was one of the .\n\n654: Dōshō introduces . Yogācāra is based on an early Indian philosophy by masters such as Vasubandhu. Practices of this lineage are also known as \"consciousness-only\" since they teach that all phenomena are phenomena of the mind. The East Asian Yogācāra school of Buddhism was founded by Xuanzang (玄奘, Jp. \"Genjō\") in China c. 630 and introduced to Japan in 654 by Dōshō, who had travelled to China to study under him. The is an important text for the Hossō school.\n\nThis school was transmitted to Japan in the 7th century.\nLiterally: \"Three-Discourse School\"; a Madhyamaka school which developed in China based on two discourses by Nagarjuna and one by Aryadeva. Madhyamaka is one of the two most important Mahayana philosophies, and reemphasizes the original Buddhist teachings that phenomena are neither truly existent or absolutely non-existent, but are characterized by impermanence and insubstantiality.\n\n736: Bodhisena introduces the Kegon (Huayan or Avataṃsaka) school to Japan. The Kegon school was founded by c. 600 and was introduced to Japan by the Indian monk Bodhisena in 736. The \"Avatamsaka Sutra\" (\"Kegon-kyō\" 華厳経) is the central text for the Kegon school. The \"Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki\" is an early Japanese annotation of this sūtra.\n\n753: Jianzhen () introduces the Risshū (Ritsu or vinaya school) to Japan.\nFounded by Daoxuan (道宣, Jp. \"Dosen\"), China, c. 650 \nFirst Introduction to Japan: Jianzhen, 753. The Ritsu school specialized in the Vinaya (the monastic rules in the Tripitaka). They used the Dharmagupta version of the vinaya which is known in Japanese as \"Shibunritsu\" (四分律)\n\nThe was one of the six schools of Buddhism introduced to Japan during the Asuka and Nara periods. Along with the and the Risshū, it is a school of Nikaya Buddhism, which is sometimes derisively known to Mahayana Buddhism as \"the Hinayana\".\n\nA Sarvastivada school, Kusha-shū focussed on abhidharma analysis based on the by the fourth-century Gandharan philosopher Vasubandhu. The school takes its name from that authoritative text.\n\n807: Saichō introduces the Tendai (Tiantai) school to Japan.\nKnown as Tiantai (天台) in China, the Tendai school was founded by Zhiyi (智顗, Jp \"Chigi\") in China, c. 550. In 804 Saichō (最澄) traveled to China to study at the Tiantai teachings, at Mount Tiantai. However, before his return he also studied, and was initiated into, the practice of the Vajrayana, with emphasis on the Mahavairocana Sutra. The primary text of Tiantai is Lotus Sutra (\"Hokke-kyō\" 法華経), but when Saichō established his school in Japan he incorporated the study and practice of Vajrayana as well. Although the studies of the Lotus Sutra and Mahayana Nirvana Sutra where also very vital to the schools as well.  These schools developed in the Middle Ages and where influenced by the Tientai, Chinese schools of the sixth century.\n816: Kūkai founds . One of the major schools of Buddhism in Japan today and one of the few surviving Vajrayana lineages in East Asia, it originally spread from India to China through traveling monks such as Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra. Known in Chinese as the Tangmi, these esoteric teachings would flourish in Japan under the auspices of a Buddhist monk named , who traveled to Tang China in 804 as part of the same expedition as Saichō. In the capital he studied Tangmi and Sanskrit and received initiation from Huiguo. On returning to Japan, Kūkai eventually managed to establish Shingon as a school in its own right. Kūkai received two lineages of teaching—one based on the and the other based on the .\n\nThe word \"Shingon\" is the Japanese pronunciation of \"Zhēnyán\" \"True Words\", which in turn is the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit word \"mantra\".\n\n1175: Hōnen introduces Pure Land Buddhism to Japan.\n\nJōdo-shū was founded by Hōnen (法然), 1175\nJapanese name: 浄土, \"Pure Land\"\nMajor Influences: Chinese Jingtu Zong (净土宗 \"Pure Land school\"), Tendai\nDoctrine: \"Nianfo\"\nPrimary Text: \"Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra\" (\"Muryōju-kyō\" 無量壽経)\n\nJōdo Shinshū was founded by Shinran (親鸞), 1224\nJapanese name: 浄土真, \"True Pure Land\"\nMajor Influences: Jōdo-shū, Tendai\nDoctrine: \"nembutsu no shinjin\" (\"nianfo of true entrusting\", that is, saying nianfo is a declaration of faith in Amida's salvation plan for the individual rather than a plan for salvation.)\nPrimary Text: \"Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra\" (\"Muryōju-kyō\" 無量壽経)\n\nJi-shū was founded by Ippen (一遍), 1270\nJapanese name: 時宗 or 時衆, \"Time\"\nMajor Influences: Jōdo-shū\nDoctrine: Nembutsu\nPrimary Text:\n\nThe Yūzū-Nembutsu school was founded by Ryōnin (良忍), 1117\nJapanese name: 融通念仏\nDoctrine: \"sokushitsu ōjō\" (速疾往生,)\nPrimary Text: \"Avatamsaka Sutra\" (\"Kegon-kyō\" 華厳経)・Lotus Sutra (\"Hokke-kyō\" 法華経)\n\nSeveral variants of Zen's practice and experiential wisdom (禅宗) were separately brought to Japan. Note that Zen influences are identifiable earlier in Japanese Buddhism, esp. cross-fertilization with Hosso and Kegon, but the independent schools were formed quite late.\n\n1191: Eisai introduces the Rinzai school to Japan.\nFounder: Linji Yixuan (臨済義玄), China, c. 850\nChinese name: Linji school (臨済宗), named after founder\nFirst Introduction to Japan: Eisai (栄西), 1191\nMajor Influences: East Asian Yogācāra, Kegon\nDoctrine: zazen (坐禅, \"sitting meditation\"), especially kōan (公案, \"public matter\") practice\nPrimary Texts: Transcendental Wisdom Sutras aka Prajnaparamita (般若波羅蜜経), incl.

The Nichiren Fuju-fuse-ha sub-sect of Nichiren Buddhism was abolished in 1669 and legalised again in 1876.\nToday's Nichiren Buddhism is represented by traditional-oriented schools such as Honmon Butsuryū-shū, Nichiren-shū and Nichiren Shōshū and more recent movements like the Soka Gakkai, Risshō Kōsei Kai, Reiyūkai and Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga. See Nichiren Buddhism for a more complete list.\n\nMajor Influences: Tendai\nPrimary Texts: Lotus Sutra (妙法蓮華經: \"Myōhō Renge Kyō\"; abbrev. 法華經: \"Hokke-kyō\"), treatises and letters by Nichiren.\nMantra: Nam(u) Myōhō Renge Kyō\" (南無妙法蓮華經)\n\nJapanese culture maintained an uneasy relation to Buddhist culture. While the Chinese culture was admired, Buddhism was also regarded as a strange influence.\n\nDuring the Kamakura (1185–1333) and Muromachi (1336–1573) Buddhism, or the Buddhist institutions, had a great influence on Japanese society. Buddhist institutions were used by the shogunate to control the country. During the Edo (1600–1868) this power was constricted, to be followed by persecutions at the beginning of the Meiji-restoration (1868–1912). Buddhist temples played a major administrative role during the Edo period, through the Danka or \"terauke\" system. In this, Japanese citizens were required to register at their local Buddhist temples and obtain a certification (\"terauke\"), which became necessary to function in society. At first, this system was put into place to suppress Christianity, but over time it took on the larger role of census and population control.\n\nIn Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in 548. Some tiles from the Asuka period (shown above), the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of Greco-Buddhist art.\n\nBuddhist art became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the Hercules inspiration behind the Nio guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in Kamakura.\n\nVarious other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking being that of the Japanese wind god Fūjin. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god Boreas, the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or \"wind bag\" in the same general attitude. The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.\n\nAnother Buddhist deity, Shukongōshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the Silk Road. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent Vajrapani, the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.\n\nThe artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.\n\nSoga no Umako built Hōkō-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 to 596. It was later renamed as Asuka-dera for Asuka, the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early Shinto shrines, early Buddhist temples were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early Heian period (9th–10th century) saw an evolution of style based on the mikkyō sects Tendai and Shingon Buddhism. The Daibutsuyō style and the Zenshūyō style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century.\n\nAlthough its date and practices vary region to region, the Bon Festival is celebrated primarily in Japan and in communities with large Japanese diaspora communities. It is believed that the spirits of the dead return to earth for three days and visit the family shrines or graves. It is customary to clean the graves and to hold family reunions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21738956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21738956", "title": "Catuṣkoṭi", "text": "Catuṣkoṭi\n\nCatuṣkoṭi (Sanskrit; Devanagari: चतुष्कोटि, ) is a logical argument(s) of a 'suite of four discrete functions' or 'an indivisible quaternity' that has multiple applications and has been important in the Dharmic traditions of Indian logic, the Buddhist logico-epistemological traditions, particularly those of the Madhyamaka school, and in the skeptical Greek philosophy of Pyrrhonism.\n\nIn particular, the catuṣkoṭi is a \"four-cornered\" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, \"P\":\n\nThese four statements hold the following properties: (1) each alternative is mutually exclusive (that is, one of, but no more than one of, the four statements is true) and (2) that all the alternatives are together exhaustive (that is, at least one of them must necessarily be true). This system of logic not only provides a novel method of classifying propositions into logical alternatives, but also because it does so in such a manner that the alternatives are not dependent on the number of truth-values assumed in the system of logic.\n\nThe following is an adaptation of the model of Puhakka (2003: p. 133) with the clear identification of the positive and negative configurations of the Catuṣkoṭi following Ng (1993: pp. 99–105).\n\nP stands for any proposition and Not-P stands for the diametrical opposite or the contradiction of P (in a relationship of contradistinction); P and Not-P constitute a complementary bifurcation of mutual exclusivity, collectively constituting an exhaustive set of positions for any given (or determined) propositional array. A propositional array is signified in the model by numerals, traditionally though, propositional arrays were designated 'foot' (Sanskrit: pāda), a lexical item which holds the semantic field: 'line', 'one quartile of śloka'; where 'śloka' (Sanskrit) holds the semantic field: 'verse', 'stanza'.\n\nŚūnyatā is the ninth 'view' (Sanskrit: dṛṣṭi), the viewless view, a superposition of the eight possible arrays of proposition P [and its 'inseparable contradistinction' (Sanskrit: apoha)].\n\nThe eight arrays or octaves of the iconographic Dharmacakra represent drishti or traditional views that Shakyamuni countered. These eight arrays may be plotted as coordinates on a multidimensional field which may be rendered as a sphere, a mandala, a multidimensional shunya or zero where shunyata denotes zero-ness. The eight arrays are in a concordant relationship where they each constitute a chord to the sphere. The coordinates are equidistant from the epicentre of shunya where the array of the positive configuration (or hemisphere) and the array of the negative configuration (or hemisphere) constitute two polar radii or diametrical complements, a diameter in sum. These are the 'eight limits' (Wylie: mtha' brgyad; Sanskrit: aṣṭānta) of 'openness' (Sanskrit: śūnyatā), where śūnyatā is amplified by 'freedom from constructs' or 'simplicity' (Wylie: spros bral; Sanskrit: aprapañca). Karmay (1988: p. 118) conveys that 'spros bral' is a homologue of 'thig le' (Sanskrit: bindu), where 'spros bral' is literally \"without amplification\", understood as \"that which cannot be displayed\".\n\nIn other words, it makes no difference whether you are working with positive configuration or negative configuration.\n\nMore over, if you replace p with not P, then the positive configuration set for not P will be the same as negative configuration of P.\n\nPuhakka (2003: p. 134-145) charts the stylized reification process of a human sentient being, the spell of reality, a spell dispelled by the Catuṣkoṭi: \n\nWe are typically not aware of ourselves as taking something (P) as real. Rather, its reality \"takes us,\" or already has us in its spell as soon as we become aware of its identity (P). Furthermore, it's impossible to take something (P) to be real without, at least momentarily, ignoring or denying that which it is not (not-P). Thus the act of taking something as real necessarily involves some degree of unconsciousness or lack of awareness. This is true even in the simple act of perception when we see a figure that we become aware of as \"something.\" As the German gestalt psychologists demonstrated, for each figure perceived, there is a background of which we remain relatively unaware. We can extend this to texts or spoken communications. For every text we understand there is a context we are not fully cognizant of. Thus, with every figure noticed or reality affirmed, there is, inevitably, unawareness. Is this how a spell works? It takes us unawares.\nThe Catuṣkoṭi in Western Discourse has often been glossed Tetralemma, which is the nomenclature for the Greek form. Both of the variations have similarities but also differences and the traditions were mutually iterating.\n\nAntecedents of the Catuṣkoṭi have been charted to grammatical structures in the Vedas. The Nasadiya Sukta of the \"Rigveda\" (RV 10.129) contains ontological speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of \"catuskoti\": \"A\", \"not A\", \"A and not A\", and \"not A and not not A\".\n\nMcEvilley (2002: p. 495) maps an interesting case for mutual iteration and pervasion between Pyrrhonism and Madhyamika:\n\nAn extraordinary similarity, that has long been noticed, between Pyrrhonism and Mādhyamika is the formula known in connection with Buddhism as the fourfold negation (\"catuṣkoṭi\") and which in Pyrrhonic form might be called the fourfold indeterminacy.\nIn Pyrrhonism the fourfold indeterminacy is used as a maxim for practice. This maxim is also related to the shorter, \"nothing more\" (ou mallon) maxim used by Democritus.\n\nGorgias (c 487-376 ), the author of a lost work: \"On Nature or the Non-Existent.\" This book was lost but was paraphrased by Sextus Empiricus in \"Against the Professors\". In his book Gorgias lays out a trilemma similar to the Catuṣkoṭi:\n\n\nJainism has a sevenfold logical architecture, the Syādvāda, which is a formulation to convey the insight of Anekantavada.\n\nŚākyamuni, as remembered by Ānanda and codified in the \"Brahmajala Sutta\" 2.27, when expounding the sixteenth wrong view, or the fourth wrong view of the 'Eel-Wrigglers' (Pali: amarā-vikheppikā), the non-committal equivocators who adhered to Ajñana, the sceptical philosophy, though the grammatical structure is identical to the Catuṣkoṭi (and there are numerous other analogues of this fourfold grammatical structure within this Sutta), the intentionality of the architecture employed by Nagarjuna is not evident, as rendered into English by Walshe (1987, 1995: p. 81):\n\n'What is the fourth way? Here, an ascetic or Brahmin is dull and stupid. Because of his dullness and stupidity, when he is questioned he resorts to evasive statements and wriggles like an eel: \"If you ask me whether there is another world. But I don't say so. And I don't say otherwise. And I don't say it is not, and I don't not say it is not.\" \"Is there no other world?...\" \"Is there both another world and no other world?...\"Is there neither another world nor no other world?...\" \"Are there spontaneously-born beings?...\" \"Are there not...?\" \"Both...? \"Neither...?\" \"Does the Tathagata exist after death? Does he not exist after death? Does he both exist and not exist after death? Does he neither exist nor not exist after death?...\" \"If I thought so, I would say so...I don't say so...I don't say it is not.\" This is the fourth case.'\n\nRobinson (1957: p. 294) holds that Stcherbatsky (1927), opened a productive period in Madhyamaka studies. Schayer (1933) made a departure into the rules of inference employed by early Buddhist dialecticians and examines the Catuskoti (Tetralemma) as an attribute of propositional logic and critiques Stcherbatsky. Robinson (1957: p. 294) states that \"Schayers criticisms of Stcherbatsky are incisive and just.\" Murti (1955) makes no mention of the logical contribution of Schayer. According to Robinson (1957: p. 294), Murti furthered the work of Stcherbatsky amongst others, and brought what Robinson terms \"the metaphysical phase of investigation\" to its apogee though qualifies this with: \"Murti has a lot to say about 'dialectic,' but practically nothing to say about formal logic.\" Robinson (1957: p. 294) opines that Nakamura (1954), developed Schayer's methodology and defended and progressed its application.\n\nRobinson (1957: p. 293) opines that the 'metaphysical approach' evident foremost in Murti (1955) was not founded in a firm understanding of the 'logical structure of the system', i.e. catuskoti, for example:\n\nSeveral fundamental limitations of the metaphysical approach are now apparent. It has tried to find comprehensive answers without knowing the answers to the more restricted questions involved - such questions as those of the epistemological and logical structure of the system.\nRobinson (1957: p. 296) conveys his focus and states his methodology, clearly identifying the limitations in scope of this particular publication, which he testifies is principally built upon, though divergent from, the work of Nakamura:\n\nIn considering the formal structure of Nagarjuna's argumentation, I exclude epistemology, psychology, and ontology from consideration... Such extra-logical observations as emerge will be confined to the concluding paragraphs...\nThe Catuṣkoṭi was employed particularly by Nagarjuna who developed it and engaged it as a 'learning, investigative, meditative' portal to realize the 'openness' (Sanskrit: Śūnyatā), of Shakyamuni's Second Turning of the Dharmacakra, as categorized by the \"Sandhinirmocana Sutra\".\n\nRobinson (1957: p. 294), building on the foundations of Liebenthal (1948) to whom he gives credit, states:\n\nWhat Nagarjuna wishes to prove is the irrationality of Existence, or the falsehood of reasoning which is built upon the logical principle that A equals A... Because two answers, assertion and denial, are always possible to a given question, his arguments contain two refutations, one denying the presence, one the absence of the probandum. This double refutation is called the Middle Path. [\"emphasis evident in Robinson\"]\nThe Catuṣkoṭi, following Nagarjuna, has had a profound impact upon the development of Buddhist logic and its dialectical refinement of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nRobinson (1957: p. 294) qualifies the import of Nagarjuna's work (which includes Nagarjuna's application of the Catuskoti) due to the embedded noise in the scholarly lineage: \"Certainly some of Nagarjuna's ancient opponents were just as confused as his modern interpreters...\". This noise may also have co-arisen with Nagarjuna, following the work of Jayatilleke (1967).\n\nWayman (1977) proffers that the Catuṣkoṭi may be employed in different ways and often these are not clearly stated in discussion nor the tradition. Wayman (1977) holds that the Catuṣkoṭi may be applied in suite, that is all are applicable to a given topic forming a paradoxical matrix; or they may be applied like trains running on tracks (or employing another metaphor, four mercury switches where only certain functions or switches are employed at particular times). This difference in particular establishes a distinction with the Greek tradition of the Tetralemma. Also, predicate logic has been applied to the Dharmic Tradition, and though this in some quarters has established interesting correlates and extension of the logico-mathematical traditions of the Greeks, it has also obscured the logico-grammatical traditions of the Dharmic Traditions of Catuṣkoṭi within modern English discourse.\n\nThe 'Four Extremes' (; Sanskrit: caturanta; Devanagari: चतुरन्त) is a particular application of the Catuṣkoṭi:\n\nDumoulin \"et al.\" (1988, 2005: pp. 43–44), in the initially groundbreaking work on Zen which is now for the most part dated due to progress in scholarship (though still useful as the premier English work of comprehensive overview), model a particular formulation of the Catuṣkoṭi that approaches the Caturanta engaging the Buddhist technical term 'dharmas' and attribute the model to Nagarjuna:\n\nIf we focus on the doctrinal agreement that exists between the Wisdom Sūtras and the tracts of the Mādhyamika we note that both schools characteristically practice a didactic negation. By setting up a series of self-contradictory oppositions, Nāgārjuna disproves all conceivable statements, which can be reduced to these four:\nWith the aid of these four alternatives (\"catuṣkoṭika\": affirmation, negation, double affirmation, double negation), Nāgārjuna rejects all firm standpoints and traces a middle path between being and nonbeing. Most likely the eight negations, arranged in couplets in Chinese, can be traced back to Nāgārjuna: neither destruction nor production, neither annihilation nor permanence, neither unity nor difference, neither coming nor going.\nA Mantrayana enumeration of the Four Limits or the Four Extremes within the Buddhadharma is also common. These four 'limits' are evident in the earliest sutras of the Theravadin of the First Turning, through the Second Turning philosophy of Nagarjuna and his disciples and commentators and also evident in the Third Turning as evidenced in the presentation of Padmasambhava. Padmasambhava in his 'Secret Instruction in a Garland of Vision' lists them as follows with the English rendering following Dowman (2003) and Wylie following Norbu \"et al.\" (2001):\n\nEach one of these extreme views, limits and binds the open, unbounded spaciousness of the natural mind.\n\nWithin English Buddhist logico-epistemological discourse, there is and has been historically, much obstruction to an understanding of the Caturanta (as the Catuṣkoṭi) due to inherent negligence in terminology not being clearly defined from the outset. That said, acquisition of terminology must be engaged and actualized though the sadhana of the 'mūla prajñā', as definitions are slippery and challenging to pinpoint that hold for all contexts. Language usage in Buddhist logic is not intuitive but technical and must be learnt, acquired through the \"perfection\" and \"power\" of 'diligence' (Sanskrit: vīrya). The following quotations are cited to provide insight (\"in lieu\" of technical definitions) into the understanding of the technical Buddhist terms 'existence', 'nature', 'being', 'entity' and 'svabhava' which are all mutually qualifying.\n\nRobinson (1957: p. 297) renders \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" 21.14, thus:\n\n\"He who posits an entity becomes entangled in eternalism and annihilism,\nsince that entity has to be either permanent or impermanent.\"\nRobinson (1957: p. 300) in discussing the Buddhist logic of Nagarjuna, frames a view of 'svabhava':\n\nSvabhava is by defini[t]ion the subject of contradictory ascriptions. If it exists, it must belong to an existent entity, which means that it must be conditioned, dependent on other entities, and possessed of causes. But a svabhava is by definition unconditioned, not dependent on other entities, and not caused. Thus the existence of a svabhava is impossible. [\"NB: typographical errors repaired\"] \n\"Nature\" (a gloss of prakrti which in this context equals svabhava) does not entail an alter-entity:\n\nThe term \"nature\" (prakrti equals svabhava) has no complement...\"If (anythings) existence is due to its nature, its non-existence will not occur, since the alter-entity (complement) of a nature never occurs.\" (\"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\", 15.8)\n\nThat is, a nature is the class of properties attributed to a class of terms Since they are necessarily present throughout the range of the subject or class of subjects, cases of their absence do not occur.\nY Karunadasa (1999, 2000: p. 1) holds that Early Buddhism and early Buddhist discourse \"often refer to the mutual opposition between two views\": \n\nAs Shakyamuni relates in a 'thread' (Sanskrit: \"sūtra\") of discourse to Kaccānagotta in the \"Kaccānagotta Sutta\", rendered into English by Myanmar Piṭaka Association Editorial Committee (1993: p. 35):\n\n\"For the most part, Kaccāna, sentient beings depend on two kinds of belief - belief that 'there is' (things exist) and belief that 'there is not' (things do not exist).\nY Karunadasa (1999, 2000: p. 1) states that:\n\n...it is within the framework of the Buddhist critique of \"sassatavada\" and \"ucchadavada\" that the Buddhist doctrines seem to assume their significance. For it is through the demolition of these two world-views that Buddhism seeks to construct its own world-view. The conclusion is that it was as a critical response to the mutual opposition between these two views that Buddhism emerged as a new faith amidst many other faiths.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26956099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26956099", "title": "Configurational analysis", "text": "Configurational analysis\n\nIn cultural and social studies, configurations are patterns of behaviour, movement (→movement culture) and thinking, which research observes when analysing different cultures and/ or historical changes. The term “configurations” is mostly used by comparative anthropological studies and by cultural history. Configurational analysis became a special method by the Stuttgart school of Historical Behaviour Studies during the 1970s and later by body culture studies in Denmark.\nConfigurational analysis is marked by its distance towards the history of ideas and intentions, which are conceived as mainstreams in historical studies. Configurations of human behaviour and movement have attracted special attention in the framework of phenomenology (→Phenomenology (philosophy)) and particularly in materialist phenomenology.\n\nConfigurations in different cultures were studied since early twentieth century.\n\nRuth Benedict (1934) contributed to the anthropology of Native Americans by using the term of “configurations” as a translation of German “Gestalt ”. Configuration denoted a whole of social attitudes, practices and beliefs and was nearly identical with “culture”. It was used for comparison – between the Hopi Indians and the Indians of the prairies, between Japanese and Western culture – and in a perspective of cultural relativism: Each culture has configurations of its own.\n\nGaston Bachelard (1938) used the term ”diagram” to describe an order of conceived reality both in scientific and in literary understanding. This was his key to a \"materialist psychoanalysis\". Bachelard’s approach became later a source of inspiration for Michel Foucault.\n\nNorbert Elias (1939, 1970) described certain patterns of relations between human beings as \"figuration \" – in English: ”configuration” – becoming visible in play of cards, dance and football. He described these configurations as \"das sich wandelnde Muster, das die Spieler miteinander bilden\" (the changing pattern, which players form with each other), \"Spannungsgefüge\" (relations of suspense), \"Interdependenz der Spieler\" (interdependence of players), and \"das fluktuierende Spannungsgleichgewicht, das Hin und Her einer Machtbalance\" (the fluctuating balance of suspense, the to-and-fro of a balance of power). This became a key to his sociology of civilization.\n\nMichel Foucault (1966) used the term \"la configuration\" in historical studies of philosophy, in order to characterize “the order of the things”, patterns of knowledge changing in epistemological disruptions. The configurations of savoir changed, according to Foucault, in following historical steps:\n\nThere are indicators that these configurations may disappear or transform again in a post-modern age.\n\nConfigurational analysis (in German \"Konfigurationsanalyse\") became a particular methodological approach in the framework of Historical Behaviour Studies, as they were developed at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970s by the historians August Nitschke and Henning Eichberg. Nitschke analyzed \"raum-zeitliche Muster\" (patterns of space and time) and \"Körperanordnungen\" (orders of the body) as “configurations” when comparing patterns of art and patterns of social behavior. Configurations were similarities, analogies and changing patterns of figures in a given space.\n\nThis analytical approach was comparable to concepts, which in recent time have challenged historiography: mentality (Georges Duby), affect control (Norbert Elias) (→Affect control theory), perception (Lucien Febvre), structural thinking (Claude Lévi-Strauss), needs (David McClelland), and interaction (George Herbert Mead). \nThe configurational approach contrasted deliberately with the mainstream of historiography explaining history by the aims of its actors (pragmatism), as an expression of weltanschauung (psychology and history of ideas) or by interests (in social history).\n\nThe configurational analysis was especially applied to comparative and historical studies of sport and dance as indicators of social change. The comparative analysis of athletics, ball games, equestrianism, martial arts, gymnastics, and dance showed some common configurations as: the functional parceling of space, a new dynamic of “progress” and speed, the modern taste of suspense, the principle of competition, and the production of result tables. The configurations of movement culture prefigured the patterns of productivity orientation, which characterized the Industrial Age.\n\nThe applied concept of “configuration” was here different from \"system\" (→cultural system) (being more static and systematic, and related to the negative term of the non-systematic), from “style” (being more aesthetic and having undertones of taste, subjectivity and stylization), and from “structure” (having undertones of “the functional”, as a heritage from structural functionalism in sociology). In contrast to these terms, configuration denotes a more dynamic pattern in change.\n\nConfigurations as patterns of behaviour, movement and thinking reflect man's perception of reality. They give an epochal pattern of perception which concurrently defines a framework for action. But in no way they describe the whole reality of an epoch. Furthermore, their power to explain individual actions is limited. The epochal \"reality\" is no straitjacket which does not allow freedom of action. Nevertheless, in each epoch there are typical ways to act or to behave, to move or to think. They correspond with the way people perceive reality. Acting or thinking in this way may be right or wrong – it is typical anyway.\n\nStudies of body culture, which spread in Denmark during the 1980s, developed the configurational analysis further, revealing inner tensions and contradictions of a given society. \nThe configurative approach was applied to the analysis and especially to comparison of different fields of activities: popular festivity, fitness culture (→physical fitness), sportive and non-sportive ball games, sport racing and parcour, different outdoor activities, and different health cultures. Configurational analysis focused on bodily movement in time and space, on the energy of movement, on interpersonal relations, and on the objectification of movement. Above this basis, analysis included the superstructure of institutions and ideas (→Base and superstructure), which organize and reflect collective actions and interests.\n\nConfigurational analysis can be compared with other contemporary approaches in cultural and social studies.\n\nIn any of these approaches, “configuration” made it possible to compare concrete human practice – i.e. “material” bodily phenomena – with larger spheres of society and culture.\n\nBachelard, Gaston 1938: \"La psychanalyse du feu.\" – English 1964: \"Psychoanalysis of fire.\" Boston: Beacon\n\nBenedict, Ruth 1934: \"Patterns of Culture.\" Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin\n\nBourdieu, Pierre 1966/67: \"Champs intellectuel et projet créateur.\" In: \"Temps modernes\", 22, 865-906\n\nDietrich, Knut 2001 (ed.): \"How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.\" University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences\n\nEichberg, Henning 1978: \"Leistung, Spannung Geschwindigkeit.

{"id": "177081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177081", "title": "Discourse on the Method", "text": "Discourse on the Method\n\nDiscourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences () is a philosophical and autobiographical treatise published by René Descartes in 1637. It is best known as the source of the famous quotation \"Je pense, donc je suis\" (English: \"I think, therefore I am\", or \"I am thinking, therefore I exist\"), which occurs in Part IV of the work. The similar Latin statement, \"Cogito, ergo sum\", is found in \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" (1641) and \"Principles of Philosophy\" (1644).\n\n\"Discourse on the Method\" is one of the most influential works in the history of modern philosophy, and important to the development of natural sciences. In this work, Descartes tackles the problem of skepticism, which had previously been studied by Sextus Empiricus, Al-Ghazali and Michel de Montaigne. Descartes modified it to account for a truth he found to be incontrovertible. Descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions.\n\nThe book was originally published in Leiden, in the Netherlands. Later, it was translated into Latin and published in 1656 in Amsterdam. The book was intended as an introduction to three works: \"Dioptrique\", \"Météores\" and \"Géométrie\". \"La Géométrie\" contains Descartes's initial concepts that later developed into the Cartesian coordinate system. The text was written and published in French rather than the language in which philosophical and scientific texts were most frequently written and published in at the time, namely, Latin. Most of Descartes' other works were written in Latin.\n\nTogether with \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", \"Principles of Philosophy\" and \"Rules for the Direction of the Mind\", it forms the base of the epistemology known as Cartesianism.\n\nThe book is divided into six parts, described in the author's preface as\n\n\nDescartes begins by allowing himself some wit:\n\n\"Good sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess.\"\n\nA similar observation can be found in Hobbes: \"But this proveth rather that men are in that point equal, than unequal. For there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share\", but also in Montaigne, whose formulation indicates that it was a common place at the time: \"Tis commonly said that the justest portion Nature has given us of her favors is that of sense; for there is no one who is not contented with his share.\" Descartes continues with a warning:\n\n\"For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it.\"\n\nDescartes describes his disappointment with his education: \"as soon as I had finished the entire course of study... I found myself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I had advanced no farther... than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance.\" He notes his special delight with mathematics, and contrasts its strong foundations to \"the disquisitions of the ancient moralists [which are] towering and magnificent palaces with no better foundation than sand and mud\".\n\nDescartes was in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country, and describes his intent by a \"building metaphor\". He observes that buildings, cities or nations that have been planned by a single hand are more elegant and commodious than those that have grown organically. He resolves not to build on old foundations, or to lean upon principles which, he had taken on faith in his youth. Descartes seeks to ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the knowledge of whatever lay within the compass of his powers; he presents four precepts:\n\n\"The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.\"\n\n\"The second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its adequate solution.\"\n\n\"The third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by little and little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of the more complex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects which in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and sequence.\"\n\n\"And the last, in every case to make enumerations so complete, and reviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.\"\n\nDescartes uses the analogy of rebuilding a house from secure foundations, and extends the analogy to the idea of needing a temporary abode while his own house is being rebuilt. The following three maxims were adopted by Descartes so that he could effectively function in the \"real world\" while experimenting with his method of radical doubt. They formed a rudimentary belief system from which to act before he developed a new system based on the truths he discovered using his method:\n\nApplying the method to itself, Descartes challenges his own reasoning and reason itself. But Descartes believes three things are not susceptible to doubt and the three support each other to form a stable foundation for the method. He cannot doubt that something has to be there to do the doubting (I think, therefore I am). The method of doubt cannot doubt reason as it is based on reason itself. By reason there exists a God, and God is the guarantor that reason is not misguided. Descartes supplies three different proofs for the existence of God, including what is now referred to as the ontological proof of the existence of God.\n\nHere he describes how in other writings he discusses the idea of laws of nature, of the sun and stars, the idea of the moon being the cause of ebb and flow, on gravitation, and going on to discuss light and fire.\n\nDescribing his work on light, he states that he\n\n\"expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be which is found in the sun and the stars, and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens.\"\n\nHis work on such physico-mechanical laws is, however, projected into a \"new world.\" A theoretical place God created \"somewhere in the imaginary spaces [with] matter sufficient to compose . . . [a \"new world\" in which He] . . . agitate[d] variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter, so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned, and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature, and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established.\" He does this \"to express my judgment regarding . . . [his subjects] with greater freedom, without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned.\" Descartes goes on to say that he \"was not, however, disposed, from these circumstances, to conclude that this world had been created in the manner I described; for it is much more likely that God made it at the first such as it was to be.\" Despite this admission, it seems that Descartes' project for understanding the world was that of re-creating creation—a cosmological project which aimed, through Descartes' particular brand of experimental method, to show not merely the possibility of such a system, but to suggest that this way of looking at the world—one with (as Descartes saw it) no assumptions about God or nature—provided the only basis upon which he could see knowledge progressing (as he states in Book II). Thus, in Descartes' work, we can see some of the fundamental assumptions of modern cosmology in evidence—the project of examing the historical construction of the universe through a set of quantitative laws describing interactions which would allow the ordered present to be constructed from a chaotic past.\n\nHe goes on to the motion of the blood in the heart and arteries, endorsing the findings of \"a physician of England\" about the circulation of blood, referring to William Harvey and his work \"De motu cordis\" in a marginal note. But then he disagrees strongly about the function of the heart as a pump, ascribing the motive power of the circulation to heat rather than muscular contraction. He describes that these motions seem to be totally independent of what we think, and concludes that our bodies are separate from our souls.\n\nHe does not seem to distinguish between mind, spirit and soul, which are identified as our faculty for rational thinking. Hence the term \"I think, therefore I am.\" All three of these words (particularly \"mind\" and \"soul\") can be identified by the single French term \"âme.\"\n\nDescartes begins by noting, without directly referring to it, the recent trial of Galileo for heresy and the condemnation of heliocentrism; he explains that for these reasons he has been slow to publish.\n\n\"I remarked, moreover, with respect to experiments, that they become always more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge; for, at the commencement, it is better to make use only of what is spontaneously presented to our senses.\"\n\n\"First, I have essayed to find in general the principles, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world.\"\n\nSecure on these foundation stones, Descartes shows the practical application of \"the Method\" in Mathematics and the Science.\n\nThe most important influence, however, was the first precept, which states, in Descartes words, \"never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such.\" This method of pro-foundational skepticism is considered to be the start of modern philosophy.\n\n\n\n"}

The term is used in various intertwined contexts, with related meanings. In Jungian psychology, the synonymous term psychic death is used, which refers to a fundamental transformation of the psyche. In death and rebirth mythology, ego death is a phase of self-surrender and transition, as described by Joseph Campbell in his research on the mythology of the Hero's Journey. It is a recurrent theme in world mythology and is also used as a metaphor in some strands of contemporary western thinking.\n\nIn descriptions of psychedelic experiences, the term is used synonymously with ego-loss to refer to (temporary) loss of one's sense of self due to the use of psychedelics. The term was used as such by Timothy Leary et al. to describe the death of the ego in the first phase of an LSD trip, in which a \"complete transcendence\" of the self and the \"game\" occurs. The concept is also used in contemporary spirituality and in the modern understanding of eastern religions to describe a permanent loss of \"attachment to a separate sense of self\" and self-centeredness. This conception is an influential part of Eckhart Tolle's teachings, where Ego is presented as an accumulation of thoughts and emotions, continuously identified with, which creates the idea and feeling of being a separate entity, and only by disidentifying one's consciousness from it can one truly be free from suffering (in the Buddhist meaning).\n\n\"Ego death\" and the related term \"ego loss\" have been defined in the context of mysticism by the religious studies scholar Daniel Mekur as \"an imageless experience in which there is no sense of personal identity. It is the experience that remains possible in a state of extremely deep trance when the ego-functions of reality-testing, sense-perception, memory, reason, fantasy and self-representation are repressed [...] Muslim Sufis call it \"fana\" (annihilation), and medieval Jewish kabbalists termed it \"the kiss of death\".\n\nCarter Phipps equates Enlightenment and ego death, which he defines as \"the renunciation, rejection and, ultimately, the death of the need to hold on to a separate, self-centered existence.\n\nIn Jungian psychology, Ventegodt and Merrick define ego death as \"a fundamental transformation of the psyche. Such a shift in personality has been labeled an \"ego death\" in Buddhism or a psychic death by Jung.\n\nIn comparative mythology, Ego death is the second phase of Joseph Campbell's description of The Hero's Journey, which includes a phase of separation, transition, and incorporation. The second phase is a phase of self-surrender and ego-death, where-after the hero returns to enrich the world with his discoveries.\n\nIn psychedelic culture, Leary, Metzer & Alpert (1964) define ego death, or ego loss as they call it, as part of the (symbolic) experience of death in which the old ego must die before one can be spiritually reborn. They define Ego loss as \"... complete transcendence − beyond words, beyond space−time, beyond self. There are no visions, no sense of self, no thoughts. There are only pure awareness and ecstatic freedom\". \n\nSeveral psychologists working on psychedelics have defined ego-death. Alnaes (1964) defines ego-death as \"[L]oss of ego-feeling.\". Stanislav Grof (1988) defines it as \"a sense of total annihilation [...] This experience of \"ego death\" seems to entail an instant merciless destruction of all previous reference points in the life of the individual [...] [E]go death means an irreversible end to one's philosophical identification with what Alan Watts called \"skin-encapsulated ego\". The psychologist John Harrison (2010) defines \"[T]emporary ego death [as the] loss of the separate self[,] or, in the affirmative, [...] a deep and profound merging with the transcendent other. Johnson, Richards & Griffiths (2008), paraphrasing Leary \"et al.\" and Grof:\ndefine ego death as \"temporarily experienc[ing] a complete loss of subjective self-identity.\n\nThe concept of \"ego death\" developed along a number of intertwined strands of thought, especially romantic movements and subcultures, Theosophy, anthropological research on rites de passage and shamanism Joseph Campbell's comparative mythology, Jungian psychology, the psychedelic scene of the 1960s, and transpersonal psychology.\n\nAccording to Merkur,\n\nAccording to Ventegodt and Merrick, the Jungian term \"psychic death\" is a synonym for \"ego death\":\n\nVentegodt and Merrick refer to Jung's publications \"The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious\", first published 1933, and \"Psychology and Alchemy\", first published in 1944.\n\nIn Jungian psychology, a unification of archetypal opposites has to be reached, during a process of conscious suffering, in which consciousness \"dies\" and resurrects. Jung called this process \"the transcendent function\", which leads to a \"more inclusive and synthetic consciousness\".\n\nJung used analogies with alchemy to describe the individuation process, and the transference-processes which occur during therapy.\n\nAccording to Leeming et al., from a religious point of view psychic death is related to St. John of the Cross' \"Ascent of Mt. Carmel\" and \"Dark Night of the Soul\".\n\nIn 1949, Joseph Campbell published \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", a study on the archetype of the Hero's Journey. It describes a common theme found in many cultures worldwide, and is also described in many contemporary theories on personal transformation. In traditional cultures it describes the \"wilderness passage\", the transition from adolescence into adulthood. It typically includes a phase of separation, transition, and incorporation. The second phase is a phase of self-surrender and ego-death, whereafter the hero returns to enrich the world with their discoveries. Campbell describes the basic theme as follows:\n\nThis journey is based on the archetype of death and rebirth, in which the \"false self\" is surrendered and the \"true self\" emerges. A well known example is Dante's Divina Comedia, in which the hero descends into the underworld.\n\nConcepts and ideas from mysticism and bohemianism were inherited by the Beat Generation. When Aldous Huxley helped popularize the use of psychedelics, starting with \"The Doors of Perception\", published in 1954, Huxley also promoted a set of analogies with eastern religions, as described in \"The Perennial Philosophy.\" This book helped inspire the 1960s belief in a revolution in western consciousness and included the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" was one of the sources. Similarly, Alan Watts, in his opening statement on mystical experiences in \"This Is It,\" draws parallels with Richard Bucke's Cosmic Consciousness, describing the \"central core\" of the experience as\n\nThis interest in mysticism helped shape the emerging research and popular conversation around psychedelics in the 1960s. In 1964 William S. Burroughs drew a distinction between \"sedative\" and \"conscious-expanding\" drugs. In the 1940s and 1950s the use of LSD was restricted to military and psychiatric researchers. One of those researchers was Timothy Leary, a clinical psychologist who first encountered psychedelic drugs while on vacation in 1960, and started to research the effects of psilocybin in 1961. He sought advice from Aldous Huxley, who advised him to propagate psychedelic drugs among society's elites, including artists and intellectuals. On insistence of Allen Ginsberg, Leary, together with his younger colleague Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) also made LSD available to students. In 1962 Leary was fired, and Harvard's psychedelic research program was shut down. In 1962 Leary founded the \"Castalia Foundation\", and in 1963 he and his colleagues founded the journal \"The Psychedelic Review\".\n\nFollowing Huxley's advice, Leary wrote a manual for LSD-usage. \"The Psychedelic Experience\", published in 1964, is a guide for LSD-trips, written by Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert, loosely based on Yvan-Wentz's translation of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\". Aldous Huxley introduced the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" to Timothy Leary. According to Leary, Metzer and Alpert, the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" is \nThey construed the effect of LSD as a \"stripping away\" of ego-defenses, finding parallels between the stages of death and rebirth in the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\", and the stages of psychological \"death\" and \"rebirth\" which Leary had identified during his research. \nAccording to Leary, Metzer and Alpert it is...\n\nAlso in 1964 Randolf Alnaes published \"Therapeutic applications of the change in consciousness produced by psycholytica (LSD, Psilocybin, etc.).\" Alnaes notes that patients may become involved in existential problems as a consequence of the LSD experience. Psycholytic drugs may facilitate insight. With a short psychological treatment, patients may benefit from changes brought about by the effects of the experience.\n\nOne of the LSD-experiences may be the death crisis. Alnaes discernes three stages in this kind of experience: \n\nIn \"The Psychedelic Experience\", three stages are discerned:\n\nEach Bardo is described in the first part of \"The Psychedelic Experience\". In the second part, instructions are given which can be read to the \"voyager\". The instructions for the \"First Bardo\" state:\n\nStanislav Grof has researched the effects of psychedelic substances, which can also be induced by nonpharmacological means. Grof has developed a \"cartography of the psyche\" based on his clinical work with psychedelics, which describe the \"basic types of experience that become available to an average person\" when using psychedelics or \"various powerful non-pharmacological experiential techniques\".\n\nAccording to Grof, traditional psychiatry, psychology and psychotherapy use a model of the human personality that is limited to biography and the individual consciousness, as described by Freud. This model is inadequate to describe the experiences which result from the use of psychedelics and the use of \"powerful techniques\", which activate and mobilize \"deep unconscious and superconscious levels of the human psyche\". These levels include:\n\nEgo death appears in the fourth Perinatal Matrix. This matrix is related to the stage of delivery, the actual birth of the child. The build up of tension, pain and anxiety is suddenly released. The symbolic counterpart is the \"Death-Rebirth Experience\", in which the individual may have a strong feeling of impending catastrophe, and may be desperately struggling to stop this process. The transition from BPM III to BPM IV may involve a sense of total annihilation:\n\nAccording to Grof what dies in this process is \"a basically paranoid attitude toward the world which reflects the negative experience of the subject during childbirth and later\". When experienced in its final and most complete form,\n\nRecent research also mentions that ego loss is sometimes experienced by those under the influence of psychedelic drugs.\n\nThe Ego-Dissolution Inventory is a validated self-report questionnaire that allows for the measurement of transient ego-dissolution experiences occasioned by psychedelic drugs. \n\nFollowing the interest in psychedelics and spirituality, the term \"ego death\" has been used to describe the eastern notion of \"enlightenment\" (\"bodhi\") or \"moksha\".\n\nZen practice is said to lead to ego-death. Ego-death is also called \"great death\", in contrast to the physical \"small death\". According to Jin Y. Park, the ego death that Buddhism encourages makes an end to the \"usually-unconsciousness-and-automated quest\" to understand the sense-of-self as a thing, instead of as a process. According to Park, meditation is learning how to die by learning to \"forget\" the sense of self:\n\nAccording to Welwood, \"egolessness\" is a common experience. Egolessness appears \"in the gaps and spaces between thoughts, which usually go unnoticed\". Existential anxiety arises when one realizes that the feeling of \"I\" is nothing more than a perception. According to Welwood, only egoless awareness allows us to face and accept death in all forms.\n\nDavid Loy also mentions the fear of death, and the need to undergo ego-death to realize our true nature. According to Loy, our fear of egolessness may even be stronger than our fear of death.\n\n\"Egolessness\" is not the same as \"anatta\", non-self. \"Anatta\" means not to take the constituents of the person as a permanent entity:\n\nBernadette Roberts makes a distinction between \"no ego\" and \"no self\". According to Roberts, the falling away of the ego is not the same as the falling away of the self. \"No ego\" comes prior to the unitive state; with the falling away of the unitive state comes \"no self\". \"Ego\" is defined by Roberts as\n\nRoberts defines \"self\" as\n\nUltimately, all experiences on which these definitions are based are wiped out or dissolved. Jeff Shore further explains that \"no self\" means \"the permanent ceasing, the falling away once and for all, of the entire mechanism of reflective self-consciousness\".\n\nAccording to Roberts, both the Buddha and Christ embody the falling away of self, and the state of \"no self\". The falling away is represented by the Buddha prior to his enlightenment, starving himself by ascetic practices, and by the dying Jesus on the cross; the state of \"no self\" is represented by the enlightened Buddha with his serenity, and by the resurrected Christ.\n\nAccording to Nick Bromell, ego death is a tempering though frightening experience, which may lead to a reconciliation with the insight that there is no real self.\n\nAccording to Grof, death crises may occur over a series of psychedelic sessions until they cease to lead to panic. A conscious effort not to panic may lead to a \"pseudohallucinatory sense of transcending physical death\". According to Merkur,\n\nBoth the Vedanta and the Zen-Buddhist tradition warn that insight into the emptiness of the self, or so-called \"enlightenment experiences\", are not sufficient; further practice is necessary.\n\nJacobs warns that Advaita Vedanta practice takes years of committed practice to sever the \"occlusion\" of the so-called \"vasanas, samskaras, bodily sheaths and vrittis\", and the \"granthi or knot forming identification between Self and mind\".\n\nZen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō, or insight into one's true nature. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life. According to Hakuin, the main aim of \"post-satori practice\" (\"gogo no shugyo\" or \"kojo\", \"going beyond\") is to cultivate the \"Mind of Enlightenment\". According to Yamada Koun, \"if you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho\".\n\nShinzen Young, an American Buddhist teacher, has pointed at the difficulty integrating the experience of no self. He calls this \"the Dark Night\", or\n\nWilloughby Britton is conducting research on such phenomena which may occur during meditation, in a research program called \"The Dark Night of the Soul\". She has searched texts from various traditions to find descriptions of difficult periods on the spiritual path, and conducted interviews to find out more on the difficult sides of meditation.\n\nThe propagation of LSD-induced \"mystical experiences\", and the concept of ego death, had some influence in the 1960s, but Leary's brand of LSD-spirituality never \"quite caught on\".\n\nLeary's terminology influenced the understanding and description of the effects of psychedelics. Various reports by hippies of their psychedelic experiences describe states of diminished consciousness which were labelled as \"ego death\", but do not match Leary's descriptions. Panic attacks were occasionally also labeled as \"ego death\".\n\nJohn Lennon read \"The Psychedelic Experience\", and was strongly affected by it. He wrote \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" after reading the book, as a guide for his LSD-trips. Lennon took about a thousand acid-trips, but it only exacerbated his personal difficulties. He eventually stopped using the drug. George Harrison and Paul McCartney also concluded that LSD use didn't result in any worthwhile changes.\n\nAccording to Bromell, the experience of ego death confirms a radical pluralism that most people experience in their youth, but prefer to flee from, instead believing in a stable self and a fixed reality. He further states this also led to a different attitude among youngsters in the 1960s, rejecting the lifestyle of their parents as being deceitful and false.\n\nThe relationship between ego death and LSD has been disputed. Hunter S. Thompson, who tried LSD, saw a self-centered base in Leary's work, noting that Leary placed himself at the centre of his texts, using his persona as \"an exemplary ego, not a dissolved one\". Dan Merkur notes that the use of LSD in combination with Leary's manual often did not lead to ego-death, but to horrifying bad trips.\n\nThe relationship between LSD use and enlightenment has also been criticized. Sōtō-Zen teacher Brad Warner has repeatedly criticized the idea that psychedelic experiences lead to \"enlightenment experiences\". In response to \"The Psychedelic Experience\" he wrote:\n\nThe concept that ego-death or a similar experience might be considered a common basis for religion has been disputed by scholars in religious studies but \"has lost none of its popularity\". Scholars have also criticized Leary and Alpert's attempt to tie ego-death and psychedelics with Tibetan Buddhism. John Myrdhin Reynolds, has disputed Leary and Jung's use of the Evans-Wentz's translation of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead,\" arguing that it introduces a number of misunderstandings about Dzogchen. Reynolds argues that Evans-Wentz's was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, and that his view of Tibetan Buddhism was \"fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist\". Nonetheless, Reynolds confirms that the nonsubstantiality of the ego is the ultimate goal of the Hinayana system .\n\n\n\n"}

As these theories were refined, however, some foundationalists began to admit that even basic beliefs could be fallible, and that derived beliefs could mutually support each other; whereas some coherentists began to admit that experiential beliefs should be weighted so as to reflect realistic degrees of coherence or justification. So the rival theories began to lean closer together. Moreover, those foundationalists who wondered why there couldn't be mutual support between basic and derived beliefs were in danger of falling into coherentism. Those coherentists who wondered why experiential beliefs should be weighted more heavily than others were also falling into foundationalism.\n\nHaack argues that foundationalism and coherentism don't exhaust the field, and that an intermediate theory is more plausible than either. It is possible to include the relevance of experience for the justification of empirical beliefs, as experientialist foundationalism does but coherentism does not, and at the same time, instead of requiring a privileged class of basic beliefs, to allow for pervasive mutual dependence among beliefs, as coherentism does but foundationalism does not. These are the key ideas of foundherentism. Precursors to Haack's view include Bertrand Russell's epistemology, in which both empirical foundations and coherence are components of justification. \n\nHaack introduces the analogy of the crossword puzzle to serve as a way of understanding how there can be mutual support among beliefs (as there is mutual support among crossword entries) without vicious circularity. The analogy between the structure of evidence and the crossword puzzle helps with another problem too. The clues to a crossword are the analogue of a person's experiential evidence, and the already-completed intersecting entries are the analogue of his reasons for a belief.

He was descended from Johannes Aepinus (1499–1553), the first to adopt the Greek form (αἰπεινός) of the family name Hugk or Huck, and a leading theologian and controversialist at the time of the Protestant Reformation. After studying medicine for a time, Franz Aepinus devoted himself to the physical and mathematical sciences, in which he soon gained such distinction that he was admitted a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1755 he was briefly the director of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. In 1757 he settled in St Petersburg as member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and professor of physics, and remained there till his retirement in 1798. The rest of his life was spent at Dorpat.\n\nHe enjoyed the favor of Empress Catherine II of Russia, who appointed him tutor to her son Paul, and endeavoured, without success, to establish normal schools throughout the empire under his direction.

John was originally from Dresden, Germany and was an artist, engraver, and scagliolist, well known for his works in imitation of marble. John Augustus Richter was a partner with Domenico Bartoli another scagliolist in London beginning in 1767 and continuing through the 1777 or 1778. Bartoli emigrated from the port city of Livorn, Italy (often referred to in English as Leghorn) and, after working for almost 10 years with Richter, moved on to Ireland. One notable item the elder Richter produced was a child's building blocks set called Richter's Anchor Blocks (an example of which is currently in the collection of the UK National Trust Museum of Childhood.) Henry's older brother, John Richter (1769?–1830), was a prominent radical politician, and member of the London Corresponding Society. He was later arrested for high treason and incarcerated briefly in the Tower of London. In 1794, the Richter brothers compiled and printed John Milton's book of poems called Paradise Lost which included 13 illustrations done by Henry James. The book was dedicated and presented to His Royal Highness George, Prince of Wales while John Richter was on trial for treason. Another brother, Thomas Richter, was a director of the Phoenix Life Insurance Company and remained with them until nearly the mid century. He had a sister, Elizabeth Richter, who married Rev. James Stuart Freeman around July 1808. Richter was educated at Dr Barrow's school, Soho and St Martin's Library School, London. In about 1787, he began instruction under the artist Thomas Stothard, with whom he remained a close friend. He also began an association with William Blake. In 1788 he produced his first illustrations (to Shakespeare's plays), and first exhibited paintings, showing two landscapes at the Royal Academy, where he exhibited for many years. He became a student of the Royal Academy Schools in 1790, and reportedly studied anatomy.\n\nThroughout the 1790s Richter worked mainly as an illustrator, demonstrating skills as both draftsman and engraver; projects included editions of Samuel Richardson's \"Sir Charles Grandison\" and \"Clarissa Harlowe\" (with others, both 1793), Samuel Johnson's \"Lives of the English Poets\" (with others, 1797), and J.-H. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Paul and Virginia (1799). In 1809 Richter began to exhibit at the Associated Artists in Water Colours, Bond Street, becoming a member in 1810, and president in 1811–12. His most popular work at this stage was the genre subject A Brute of a Husband, though he also established himself as a literary painter, with depictions of such characters as Don Quixote and Falstaff, and became one of the few notable artists to paint historical subjects in watercolour. With the dissolution of the Associated Artists in Water Colours in 1812 he was elected a member of the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours, though he resigned his membership in December of the same year, and until 1820 was represented on its walls only as an exhibitor. (In that year the society returned to its original form as the Society of Painters in Water Colours.)\n\nRichter was a pioneer in painting from nature, in both practice and theory. In 1812 he painted the oil \"Christ Giving Sight to the Blind\", in bright sunlight on the roof of his house in Newman Street; the work was purchased by the trustees of the British Institution for 500 guineas and later presented to the New Church, Greenwich, completed in 1825, where it was installed as an altarpiece. A second version, attempting to improve on its truth to nature, was exhibited four years later. Then, in 1817, he published the pamphlet Daylight: a recent discovery in the art of painting, with hints on the philosophy of the fine arts, and on that of the human mind, as first dissected by Immanuel Kant. His more general ideas, including his approach to color and use of models of his compositions in clay or wax, influenced other painters, notably the miniature painter James Holmes. Daylight combined his artistic interests with his study of metaphysical philosophy. Richter also wrote the article 'Metaphysics' in the Encyclopaedia Londonensis and a paper, German Transcendentalism (1855).\n\nIn 1821 Richter was again elected to the Society of Painters in Water Colours, though his membership and the frequency of his exhibits varied through the decade. But from 1829 until his death he was both a member and a frequent exhibitor. The subjects of his most ambitious paintings of this later phase were taken from Shakespeare. He was also known for drawings and engravings of characters of Sir Walter Scott.\n\nHis work became highly popular through reproductive engravings and, from 1828, through the illustrations he produced for annuals such as the Forget-me-Not and Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833; The painting, \"The School in an Uproar\", was reproduced in several variations and even printed on pocket handkerchiefs. He reportedly produced as many as 150 works in the form of drawings, engravings and paintings. Some examples of his work are in the British Museum and in private collections. The painting, \"The Love Letter\" was shows two characters taken from Sir Walter Scott's The Antiquary and was painted between 1816–1833. A poem of the same name was authored by Letitia Elizabeth Landon who was noted for creating literary pieces based on drawings and paintings and well known during that period in the UK. The painting depicts the Mrs Mailsetter in an admonishing pose and Jenny Caxon the recipient of a love letter from her older, male beau, Lieutenant Richard Taffril, who was away at sea. An engraving by Charles Rolls of the painting and the poem were published side-by-side in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833 (London, UK Fisher Jackson). Rolls contributed by engraving a number of drawings and paintings done by Richter. It is believed that the painting may have been based on the drawing and subsequent engraving of a different view of the scene. This engraving has been referenced by the titles \"One Peep Was Enough\" and \"At the Post Office\" showing Mrs Mailsetter, Jenny and two other characters; Mrs Heukbane and Mrs Shortcake.\n\nRichter was married twice: first, at Marylebone on 9 July 1808, to Elizabeth née Smith; and second, at Marylebone on 2 May 1818, to Charlotte Sophia née Edson (d. 1862). He had at least two sons and two daughters. On 8 April 1857, Henry James Richter died at his home at 101 Lisson Grove, London. He was 85. At the time of his death, he was translating a metaphysical work by J. S. Beck, a former student of Kant. His daughter Henrietta Sophia Richter (1813–1896) was a successful amateur portrait painter, who exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1842 to 1849. His son Henry Constantine Richter (1821–1902) became a well recognised draftsman and lithographer, noted for his illustrations of birds and mammals which were reproduced in the works of the English ornithologist and bird artist, John Gould.\n"}
{"id": "24675586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24675586", "title": "Homonoia", "text": "Homonoia\n\nHomonoia () is the concept of order and unity, \"being of one mind together\" or \"union of hearts\". It was used by the Greeks to create unity in the politics of classical Greece. It saw widespread use when Alexander the Great adopted its principles to govern his vast Empire.\n\nThe concept of Homonoia was an ancient Greek concept which traditionally was not applied beyond their own culture. The Greeks viewed Homonoia as an absence of factional fighting in their city states. The Greeks viewed outside cultures as \"barbarians\". The famed scholar Aristotle once told his student, a young Alexander the Great, \"treat Greeks as friends, but [non-Greeks] as animals.\"\n\nIt was the scholar Isocrates who first looked beyond the Greek people. While he didn't preach that the savages of the non-Greek world could be on par with the superior Greek people, he did believe they could be made Greek and thus be \"of one mind together\". He claimed that Greekness could become a matter of nurture rather than nature. It was during his time spent in the court of Philip II of Macedon that Isocrates was able to teach the concept to an influential audience. Philip II took much of the concept to heart, but he too viewed it as a method reserved for the Greeks. He used the concept as his driving force behind creating the Corinthian League, an alliance to unite the Greek States for a war against the Persian Empire. After Philip II was assassinated his son Alexander the Great became King of Macedonia and himself became a proponent of Homonoia.\n\nAlexander's tutor, Aristotle, viewed non-Greeks as barbarian animals. Alexander however, ignored his teacher's indication and expanded on the concept of Homonoia. With an Empire covering most of the known world, Alexander sought to rule his subjects, whether they were Greek, Persian or Egyptian, under the concept of Homonoia. In his short time as ruler of his vast Empire he tried to adopt customs of the cultures he conquered such as Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of \"proskynesis\", either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians paid to their social superiors. He also married the officers of his army to Persian wives in an effort to further create a sense of oneness in his new Empire. Through his policies he wanted to create a new Greco-Oriental empire as distinct from the more traditional system of a small ruling class of conquerors ruling over the recently vanquished. It was his practice to place the old style Persian satrap as governors but in the newly created offices of taxation and finance he placed Macedonians. After his death most of his reforms lived on even as the Empire fragmented into successor states.\n\n\"Homonoia\" was extended under Roman rule in the highly urbanized East as a symbolic mechanism for dealing with intra-city tensions and for linking the sometimes intensely individual eastern city-states. A \"temple of Homonoia\" at Aphrodisias in Caria appears as the setting for the wedding of Callirhoe and Dionysios in the first-century CE romance \"Chaereas and Callirhoe\"; the temple is objectified in coinage of Aphrodisias that shows the cult statue of Aphrodite of Aphrodisias with those of other cities, under the legend \"homonoia\": \"Deities in the coin issues served as symbols that mediated the power within regional alliances, bolstered the prestige of the divine realm in human activity and provided the glue that bound together the political and the cosmic spheres.\" In the first century CE, the Greek rhetor Dio Chrysostom sought in one of his \"Discourses\" to establish \"homonoia\" between two cities that each claimed the sobriquet \"first city\", Nicaea and Nicopolis.\n\n\n\n"}

She obtained her Ph.D. in Zoology as a Howard Hughes Predoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington, Seattle. For her postdoctoral work, she studied the genetic basis of adaptive melanism in pocket mice at the University of Arizona. In 2003, she became an Assistant Professor at UC San Diego. Three years later she moved to Harvard University, where she was promoted to full professor in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology in 2010.\nShe is a member of the Editorial Board for \"Current Biology\".\n\nHoekstra is best known for her “elegant and inventive research” studying the genetic mechanisms that influence the evolution of highly complex natural behaviors. In 2013, Hoekstra published an article in the journal \"Nature\" on the genetics of burrowing behavior in two sister species of \"Peromyscus\" mice; the oldfield mouse (\"P. polionotus\"), which builds elaborate burrows complete with an escape tunnel, and the deer mouse (\"P. maniculatis\"), which builds a simple and shallow nest. The study is unusual for dealing with a highly complex natural behavior. Using a combination of behavioral assays and classical genetic strategies, Hoekstra and her students identified four regions of DNA, which control the length of the tunnels dug by the mice. With these sections of DNA in mind, Hoekstra is currently trying to narrow down the specific genes that control tunneling behavior in mice. Students in her lab are also studying the connections between digging behavior and the neurobiology of reward.\n\nShe has also previously studied the evolution of the color of mice coats, and its significance for adaptation. In 2013 her team published a paper in the journal \"Science\", describing how coat color in mice was controlled by nine separate mutations within a single gene, named \"agouti.\" Speaking about this discovery, Hoekstra said \"The question has always been whether evolution is dominated by these big leaps or smaller steps. When we first implicated the agouti gene, we could have stopped there and concluded that evolution takes these big steps as only one major gene was involved, but that would have been wrong. When we looked more closely, within this gene, we found that even within this single locus, there are, in fact, many small steps.\" Her work supports the hypothesis that evolution can occur through incremental changes.\n\n\nHoekstra lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her son and her husband, James Mallet. Mallet is also an evolutionary biologist at Harvard.\n\n"}

Evolutionary developmental biology is the study of the evolution of developmental processes across different organisms. It is utilized within multiple disciplines, primarily evolutionary biology and anthropology. Groundwork for the theory that \"evolutionary modifications in primate development might have led to … modern humans\" was laid by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Ernst Haeckel, Louis Bolk, and Adolph Schultz. Evolutionary developmental biology is primarily concerned with the ways in which evolution affects development, and seeks to unravel the causes of evolutionary innovations.\n\nThe approach is relatively new, but has roots in Schultz's \"The physical distinctions of man,\" from the 1940s. Shultz urged broad comparative studies to identify uniquely human traits.\n\nBrian Hall traces the roots of evolutionary developmental biology in his 2012 paper on its past present and future. He begins with Darwinian evolution and Mendel's genetics, noting the tendency of the followers of both men in the early 20th century to follow separate paths and to set aside and ignore apparently inexplicable problems. Greater understanding of genotypic and phenotypic structures from the 1940s enabled the unification of evolution and genetics in the modern synthesis. Molecular biology then enabled researchers to explore the mechanisms and evolution of embryonic development in molecular detail, including in humans.\n\nMany of the human evolutionary developmental biology studies have been modeled after primate studies and consider the two together in a comparative model. Brain ontogeny and human life history evolution were looked at by Leigh, in a 2006 paper. He compares brain growth patterns for \"Homo erectus\" and \"Homo sapiens\" to get at the evolution of brain size and weight. Leigh found three different patterns, all of which pointed to the growth rate of \"H. erectus\" either matching or exceeding \"H. erectus\". He makes the case that this finding had wide application and relevance t the overall study of human evolution. It is pertinent specifically to the connections between energy expenditure and brain development. These finding are of specific utility in studies on maternal energy expenditure. Comparative study of nonhuman primates, fossils and modern humans to study patterns of brain growth to correlate human life history and brain growth.\n\nJeremy De Silva and Julie Lesnik examined chimpanzee neonatal brain size to identify implications for brain growth in \"Homo erectus\". This changed the understanding of differences and similarities of post-natal brain growth in humans and chimpanzees. The study found that there was a distinction necessary between growth time and growth rate.The times of growth were strikingly similar, but the rates were not. The paper further advocates the use of fossils to assess brain size in general and in relation to cranial capacity.\n\nUtilization of endocranial volume as a measure for brain size has been a popular methodology with the fossil record since Darwin in the mid 1800s. This measure has been used to access the metabolic requirements for brain growth and the subsequent trade-offs.\n\nSome of the work on human evolutionary developmental biology has centered around the neotenous features that present in humans, but are not shared across the primate spectrum. Steven J. Gould discussed the presentation of neoteny with \"terminal additions\" in humans. Neoteny is defined as the delayed or slowed development in humans when compared with their non-human primate counterparts. The \"terminal additions\" were extensions or reductions in the rate and scope of stages of development and growth. Gould hypothesized that this process and production of neoteny in humans might be the key feature that ultimately lead to the emotional and communicative nature of humans. He credits this factor as an integral facet of human evolution. However, there have also been cautions against the application of this aspect to group ranking during it inappropriate as a measure of evolutionary achievement.\n\nEarly comparative and human studies examined the fossil record to measure features like cranial sizes and capacities so as to infer brain size, growth rate, total growth and potential implications for energy expenditure. Helpful as this is, the static nature of individual fossils presents its own challenge. The phylogenic fossil line is itself a hypothesis, so anything based upon it is equally hypothetical.\n\nUsing the fossil record of Neanderthals, modern humans, and chimpanzees, Gunz et al. examined that patterns of endocranial development. They found that there are common features shared between the three, and that modern humans diverge from these common patterns in the first year of life. They concluded that even though much of the developmental results are similar insofar as brain size, the trajectories by which they arrived are not shared. Most of the differences between the two arise post-natally, in the first year, with cognitive development.\n\nThere have been a number of studies that not only take incomplete fossil records into consideration, but have attempt to specifically identify the barriers presented by this condition. For example, Kieran McNulty covers the potential utilities and constraints of using incomplete fossil taxa to examine longitudinal development in Australopithecus africanis.\n\nMany studies on development have been human-specific. In his 2011 paper, Bernard Crespi focused on adaptation and genomic conflict in childhood diseases. He considers the evolution of childhood diseases and their risk levels, and finds that both risk and disease have evolved.\n\nHotchberg and Belsky incorporate a life-history perspective, looking at adolescence. Substantial variation in phenotypic paths and presentations suggest significant environmental influence. They focus on plasticity between stages of development and the factors that shape it. Rate of maturation, fecundity, and fertility were all impacted by environmental circumstances. They argue that early maturation can be positive, reflecting opportunistic actions within specific conditions.\n\nTechnological advances that have allowed better and better access to the growth of the human form in utero have proven particularly formative in studies involving focus on genetic and epigenetic development. Bakker et al. look at the interconnected nature of developmental processes and attempt to use fetal vertebral abnormalities as an indicator for other malformations. They found that the origin of the cells was not nearly as highly correlated as the observed developmental signals. In utero development and malformations were correlated in severity.\n\nFreiston and Galis look at the development of ribs, digits, and mammalian asymmetry. They argue that this construction is relevant for the study of disease, the consistency in evolution of body plans, and understanding of developmental constraints. Sexual dimorphism in prenatal digit ratio was found as early as 14 weeks and was maintained whether or not the fleshy finger part was included.\n\nLanguages and cognitive function have also been subjects of evolutionary studies. Insofar as language and evolutionary developmental biology, there is tension from the gate. Much of this contention has centered around whether to view and study language as an adaptation in and of its self, or as a by-product of other adaptations. Jackendoff and Pinker have argued for language as an adaptation owing to the interdependent social nature of humans. To support these claims, he points to things like the bi-directionality in language usage and comprehension. This is a counter to the claims by theorists like Noam Chomsky, who argued against language as a human specific adaptation.\n\nAdaptation and adaptive theory has been argued even separate from its utility in the study of language. Gould and Lewontin engage with what they saw as flaws in adaptive theory using the analogy of the spandrels of San Marco. Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially. This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition.\n\nThis debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way. Fitch argues that these two approaches can be rectified with the study of \"neutral computation and mammalian brain development\". It may be more useful to consider specific components of neural computation and development, what has been selected for, and to what end.\n\nPloeger and Galis tackled modular evolvability and developmental constraints in human and other primate evolutionary trajectories. They argue that these should be treated with an interdisciplinary approach across the cognitive sciences. They frame this in the context of:\n\n\n"}

By contrast, an outgroup is a social group with which an individual does not identify. For example, people may find it psychologically meaningful to view themselves according to their race, culture, gender, age, or religion. It has been found that the psychological membership of social groups and categories is associated with a wide variety of phenomena.\n\nThe terminology was made popular by Henri Tajfel and colleagues during his work in formulating social identity theory. The significance of ingroup and outgroup categorization was identified using a method called the minimal group paradigm. Tajfel and colleagues found that people can form self-preferencing ingroups within a matter of minutes and that such groups can form even on the basis of completely arbitrary and invented discriminatory characteristics, such as preferences for certain paintings.\n\nThe psychological categorization of people into ingroup and outgroup members is associated with a variety of phenomena. The following examples have all received a great deal of academic attention.\n\nThis refers to the fact that under certain conditions, people will prefer and have affinity for one’s ingroup over the outgroup, or anyone viewed as outside the ingroup. This can be expressed in one's evaluation of others, linking, allocation of resources, and many other ways.\n\nDiscrimination between ingroups and outgroups is a matter of favoritism towards an ingroup and the absence of equivalent favoritism towards an outgroup. Outgroup derogation is the phenomenon in which an outgroup is perceived as being threatening to the members of an ingroup. This phenomenon often accompanies ingroup favoritism, as it requires one to have an affinity towards their ingroup. Some research suggests that outgroup derogation occurs when an outgroup is perceived as blocking or hindering the goals of an ingroup. It has also been argued that outgroup derogation is a natural consequence of the categorization process.\n\nPeople have been shown to be differentially influenced by ingroup members. That is, under conditions where group categorization is psychologically salient, people will shift their beliefs in line with ingroup social norms.\n\nThis generally refers to the tendency of groups to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members, although polarization toward the most central beliefs has also been observed. It has been shown that this effect is related to a psychologically salient ingroup and outgroup categorization.\n\nCategorization of people into social groups increases the perception that group members are similar to one another. An outcome of this is the outgroup homogeneity effect. This refers to the perception of members of an outgroup as being homogenous, while members of one's ingroup are perceived as being diverse, e.g. \"they are alike; we are diverse”. This is especially likely to occur in regard to negative characteristics. Under certain conditions, ingroup members can be perceived as being similar to one another in regard to positive characteristics. This effect is called ingroup homogeneity.\n\nIn evolutionary psychology, ingroup favoritism is seen as an evolved mechanism selected for the advantages of coalition affiliation. It has been argued that characteristics such as gender and ethnicity are inflexible or even essential features of such systems. However, there is evidence that elements of favoritism are flexible in that they can be erased by changes in social categorization. One study in the field of behavioural genetics suggests that biological mechanisms may exist which favor a coexistence of both flexible and essentialist systems.\n"}

He has been a Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution's Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and is a life-time Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was educated at Mfantsipim School.\n\nGyekye is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Ghana, and a Visiting Professor of Philosophy and African-American studies at Temple University. \n\nGyekye challenges the view that in African thought, community confers personhood on the individual and thus the individual's identity is merely derivative of the community. He attributes this view to African philosopher Ifeanyi Menkiti, as well as socialist political figures like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, Senegal's Léopold Senghor, and Tanzania's Julius Nyerere.\n\nInstead, Gyekye argues that African thought ascribes definite value to the individual. He cites an Akan proverb, \"All persons are children of God; no one is a child of the earth\" in support of his argument that a person is conceived as a theomorphic being, having in their nature an aspect of God. This soul (known as okra to the Akan) is described as divine and originating with God. Thus, he argues, a person is viewed as more than just a material or physical object, but children of God, and therefore intrinsically valuable. This intrinsic value, it is argued, makes nonsense of the view that the individual's value stems solely from the community. Similarly, he argues that the person is conceived as a unique individual (as in the proverb \"antelope's soul is one, duiker's another\"), so that each individual is self-complete, and the reality of the person cannot be derivative and posterior to that of the community.\n\nWhile Gyekye argues that the individual is ontologically complete, he also acknowledges that people live in community, as in the proverb, \"When a person descends from heaven, he/she descends into a human society.\" In his view, a person's abilities are not sufficient for survival, so that community is necessary for the survival of the individual, as articulated in the proverb, \"A person is not a palm tree that he/she should be self-sufficient.\"\n\nThus, he argues, it is error to holds that African philosophy denies the individual, but instead, the individual is an intrinsically valuable child of God, intricately linked into a web of human relationships. He cites a Ghanaian artist who wrote, \"we are linked together like a chain; we are linked in life, we are linked in death; persons who share a common blood relation never break away from one another.\"\n\n"}

He wrote on the history of analytic philosophy, notably as an interpreter of Frege, and made original contributions particularly in the philosophies of mathematics, logic, language and metaphysics. He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between realism and anti-realism, a term he helped to popularize. He devised the Quota Borda system of proportional voting, based on the Borda count. In mathematical logic, he developed an intermediate logic, already studied by Kurt Gödel: the Gödel–Dummett logic.\n\nDummett was the son of a merchant of silks. He studied at Sandroyd School and was a First Scholar at Winchester College, later winning a Major Scholarship to study History at Christ Church, Oxford in 1943. He was called up that year and served, initially as a private in the Royal Artillery before joining the Intelligence Corps in India and Malaya. He was also awarded a fellowship to All Souls College, Oxford.\n\nIn 1979, Dummett became Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford, a post he held until retiring in 1992. During his term as Wykeham Professor, he held a Fellowship at New College, Oxford. He has also held teaching posts at Birmingham University, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Princeton University, and Harvard University. He won the Rolf Schock prize in 1995, and was knighted in 1999. He was the 2010 winner of the Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Oeuvre in Analytical Philosophy.\n\nDuring his career at Oxford, he supervised many philosophers who have gone on to distinguished careers, including Peter Carruthers, Adrian Moore, Ian Rumfitt, and Crispin Wright.\n\nHis work on the German philosopher Frege has been acclaimed. His first book \"\" (1973), written over many years, is now regarded as a classic. The book was instrumental in the rediscovery of Frege's work, and influenced a generation of British philosophers.\n\nIn his 1963 paper \"Realism\" he popularised a controversial approach to understanding the historical dispute between realist and other non-realist philosophy such as idealism, nominalism, Irrealism. He characterized all of the latter as anti-realist and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth. For Dummett, realism is best understood as semantic realism, i. e., as the view accepting that every declarative sentence of one's language is bivalent (determinately true or false) and evidence-transcendent (independent of our means of coming to know which), while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth. Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the material world, or even thought. The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as, at base, analogous to the dispute between intuitionism and Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nFranzane Abella commented that Dummett was really interested not in understanding problems via classical logic but via intutionistic logic, and Abella stated that \"such mathematical entities are more likely to be an ontological myth for Dummett... because truth cannot be unidentified via intuition, and of course it will fall on the notion of logical opaqueness, which statements are not likely to be understood easily in the first place.\" Franzane Abella further added that \"Dummett has an astounding influence when he brought forward the deep-order justificationist semantics; this influenced the theory of meaning and the classification of understanding via practices, whether the statement can be refuted or not based on its meaning.\" Abella summed up by saying that Dummett refuted the theory brought forward by realism about the cognisance of meaning. For example the psychological change in our conceptions of meaning of any statements should be properly grasped, because if not, there exists an alteration and confusion of meaning, and of course a failure in grasping truth-values.\n\nDummett espoused semantic anti-realism, a position suggesting that truth cannot serve as the central notion in the theory of meaning and must be replaced by verifiability. Semantic anti-realism is sometimes related to semantic inferentialism.\n\nDummett was politically active, through his work as a campaigner against racism. He let his philosophical career stall in order to influence civil rights for minorities during what he saw as a crucial period of reform in the late 1960s. He also has worked on the theory of voting, which led to his introduction of the Quota Borda system.\n\nDummett drew heavily on his work in this area in writing his book \"On Immigration and Refugees\", an account of what justice demands of states in relationship to movement between states. Dummett in that book argues that the vast majority of opposition to immigration has been founded in racism and says that this has especially been so in the UK.\n\nHe has written of his shock on finding anti-Semitic and fascist opinions in the diaries of Frege, to whose work he had devoted such a high proportion of his professional career.\n\nDummett and Robin Farquharson published influential articles on the theory of voting, in particular conjecturing that deterministic voting rules with more than three issues faced endemic strategic voting. The Dummett–Farquharson conjecture was proved by Allan Gibbard, a philosopher and former student of Kenneth J. Arrow and John Rawls, and by the economist Mark A. Satterthwaite.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Farquarson–Dummett conjecture by Gibbard and Sattherthwaite, Dummett contributed three proofs of the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem in his monograph on voting. He also wrote a shorter overview of the theory of voting for the educated public.\n\nDummett was also an established scholar in the field of card games history, with numerous books and articles to his credit. He is a founding member of the International Playing-Card Society, in whose journal \"The Playing-Card\" he regularly published opinions, research and reviews of current literature on the subject; he is also a founding member of the Accademia del Tarocchino Bolognese in Bologna. His historical work on the use of the tarot pack in card games — he has said \"(t)he fortune telling and occult part of it has never been my principal interest...\" — \"The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City\", attempted to establish that the invention of Tarot could be set in 15th-century Italy. He laid the foundation for most of the subsequent research on the game of tarot, including exhaustive accounts of the rules of all hitherto known forms of the game.\n\nHis analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown prior to the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that the middle of the 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. \"The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or than it has ever been since...\"\n\nIn 1987, Dummett collaborated with Giordano Berti and Andrea Vitali to the project of the great Tarot exhibition at Castello Estense in Ferrara; in that occasion he wrote some texts for the catalog of the exhibition.\"\n\nIn 1944, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church, and remained a practising Catholic. Throughout his career, Dummett published a number of articles on various issues facing the contemporary Catholic Church, mainly in the English Dominican journal, \"New Blackfriars\". Dummett published an essay in the bulletin of the Adoremus Society on the subject of liturgy, and a philosophical essay defending the intelligibility of the Catholic Church's teaching on the eucharist.\n\nIn October 1987, one of his contributions to \"New Blackfriars\" sparked considerable controversy, when he seemingly attacked currents of Catholic theology which appeared to him to diverge from orthodox Catholicism and to \"imply that, from the very earliest times, the Catholic Church, claiming to have a mission from God to safeguard divinely revealed truth, has taught and insisted on the acceptance of falsehoods.\" Dummett argued that \"the divergence which now obtains between what the Catholic Church purports to believe and what large or important sections of it in fact believe ought, in my view, to be tolerated no longer: not if there is to be a rationale for belonging to that Church; not if there is to be any hope of reunion with the other half of Christendom; not if the Catholic Church is not to be a laughing-stock in the eyes of the world.\" A debate in the journal over these remarks continued for months, attracting contributions from the theologian Nicholas Lash and the historian Eamon Duffy, among others.\n\nDummett retired in 1992 and was knighted in 1999 for \"services to philosophy and to racial justice\". He received the Lakatos Award in the philosophy of science in 1994.\n\nDummett died in 2011, aged 86. He was survived by his wife Ann, whom he married in 1951 (and who died in 2012), and by three sons and two daughters. A son and daughter predeceased their parents.\n\n\nNotable articles and exhibition catalogues include \"Tarot Triumphant: Tracing the Tarot\" in \"FMR\", (\"Franco Maria Ricci International\"), January/February 1985; Pattern Sheets published by the International Playing Card Society; with Giordano Berti and Andrea Vitali, the catalogue \"Tarocchi: Gioco e magia alla Corte degli Estensi\" (Bologna, Nuova Alfa Editorale, 1987).\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied engineering and mathematics at the Federal University of Paraná in Curitiba and the title of his 1961 Ph.D. dissertation was \"Topological spaces and continuous functions\".\n\nDa Costa's international recognition came especially through his work on paraconsistent logic and its application to various fields such as philosophy, law, computing, and artificial intelligence. He is one of the founders of this non-classical logic. In addition, he constructed the theory of quasi-truth that constitutes a generalization of Alfred Tarski's theory of truth, and applied it to the foundations of science.\n\nThe scope of his research also includes model theory, generalized Galois theory, axiomatic foundations of quantum theory and relativity, complexity theory, and abstract logics. Da Costa has significantly contributed to the philosophy of logic, paraconsistent modal logics, ontology, and philosophy of science. He served as the President of the Brazilian Association of Logic and the Director of the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Sao Paulo. He received many awards and held numerous visiting scholarships at universities and centers of research in all continents.\n\nDa Costa and physicist Francisco Antônio Dória axiomatized large portions of classical physics with the help of Patrick Suppes' predicates. They used that technique to show that for the axiomatized version of dynamical systems theory, chaotic properties of those systems are undecidable and Gödel-incomplete, that is, a sentence like \"X is chaotic\" is undecidable within that axiomatics. They later exhibited similar results for systems in other areas, such as mathematical economics.\n\nDa Costa believes that the significant progress in the field of logic will give rise to new fundamental developments in computing and technology, especially in connection with non-classical logics and their applications.\n\nDa Costa is co-discoverer of the truth-set principle and co-creator of the classical logic of variable-binding term operators—both with John Corcoran. He is also co-author with Chris Mortensen of the definitive pre-1980 history of variable-binding term operators in classical first order logic: “Notes on the theory of variable-binding term operators”, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol.4 (1983) 63–72.\n\nTogether with Francisco Antônio Dória, Da Costa has published two papers with conditional relative proofs of the consistency of P = NP with the usual \nset-theoretic axioms ZFC. The results they obtain are similar to the results of DeMillo and Lipton (consistency of P = NP with fragments of arithmetic) and those of Sazonov and Maté (conditional proofs of the consistency of P = NP with strong systems).\n\nBasically da Costa and Doria define a formal sentence [P = NP]' which is the same as P = NP in the standard model for arithmetic; however, because [P = NP]' by its very definition includes a disjunct that is not refutable in ZFC, [P = NP]' is not refutable in ZFC, so ZFC + [P = NP]' is consistent (assuming that ZFC is). The paper then continues by an informal proof of the implication \nHowever, a review by Ralf Schindler points out that this last step is too short and contains a gap. A recently published (2006) clarification by the authors shows that their intent was to exhibit a conditional result that was dependent on what they call a \"naïvely plausible condition\". The 2003 conditional result can be reformulated, according to da Costa and Doria 2006 (in press), as\nSo far no formal argument has been constructed to show that ZFC + [P = NP]' is omega-consistent.\n\nIn his reviews for Mathematical Reviews of the da Costa/Doria papers on P=NP, logician Andreas Blass states that \"the absence of rigor led to numerous errors (and ambiguities)\"; he also rejects da Costa's \"naïvely plausible condition\", as this assumption is \"based partly on the possible non-totality of [a certain function] F and partly on an axiom equivalent to the totality of F\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Starting his scientific research in physics in 1958, Riazuddin was considered one of the early pioneers of Pakistan's nuclear weapons development and atomic deterrence development. He was the director of the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) from 1974 until 1984. Riazuddin was the only pupil of Nobel laureate in Physics Abdus Salam..\n\nRiazuddin carried out his research at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and Daresbury Laboratory where he published papers in mathematics and physics. Riazuddin also played an important role in education in Pakistan, contributing to the rise of science in Pakistan. Riazuddin authored several scientific books on particle physics and quantum mechanics. Later in his life, he joined the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) as a visiting professor of the theoretical physics. From 2004 until his death, he also served on the Board of Governors of Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS).\n\nRiazuddin was born in Ludhiana in British Punjab of the British Indian Empire in 1930. After the Partition of India, his family migrated to Pakistan in 1947 and settled in Lahore, West-Pakistan. At age 17, Riazuddin attended Punjab University, and took his B.Sc.(Hons) in Mathematics under the supervision of Abdus Salam in 1951. Riazuddin was the only student to study Physics and Mathematics under the supervision of Abdus Salam at the Undergraduate level at Punjab University and at the Postgraduate level at Cambridge University. As a student of mathematics, he learned the advanced course on quantum mechanics under Abdus Salam, as he had made the course of quantum mechanics outside the regular curriculum. In 1951, Salam funded his scholarship, and helped him gain admission to the graduate school of Punjab University. In 1953, Salam supervised his M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics where his master's dissertation dealt with fundamental concepts of mathematical physics. By the time he published his thesis in 1953, he received a Gold medal from the Punjab University for post-graduate contributions to physics and mathematics.\n\nWith the help of Salam, Riazuddin went to the United Kingdom on a scholarship and attended Cambridge University. At Cambridge, he was awarded his PhD in Theoretical physics in 1959. Riazuddin's dissertation was written on \"Charge Radius of Pion\" which also covered many issues relevant to the field of quantum theory. Riazuddin returned to Pakistan where he joined Punjab University as an Associate professor. In 1968, Riazuddin was awarded the Gold Medal in Physical Sciences for scientists under 40 years of age by the Pakistan Academy of Sciences.\n\nRiazuddin had joined Punjab University ini 1959 as an associate professor of Mathematics. Four years later, he travelled to the United States for a fellowship awarded by Norman March and Michael Duff. He became a research associate professor at the University of Rochester where he stayed until 1965. The same year, he joined the University of Pennsylvania where he taught physics until 1966. Later, he went to Chicago, Illinois where he joined his brother Fayyazuddin, and theoretical physicists Faheem Hussain and Peter Rottoli. Riazuddin joined University of Chicago's Enrico Fermi Institute where they created the \"Relativity Group\". In 1968, Riazuddin returned to Pakistan on the request of Salam, and joined Quaid-i-Azam University's Institute of Physics. He was the founding director of the Institute of Physics (IP) where he engaged in research on string theory, the theory of relativity, particle physics and nuclear physics. Later, the scientists of the Relativity Group at the Enrico Fermi Institute returned to Pakistan on the request of Salam. In 1970, he returned to the United States where he became Professor of Mathematics at the University of Maryland. Riazuddin left the United States for Italy as he was asked by Salam to join the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 1970. He was joined by other students of Salam where they created a Theoretical Physics Group at the ICTP. In 1971, Riazuddin traveled to the United Kingdom to join the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory where he was joined by Michael Duff. At Daresbury, he became senior research associate. There, Riazuddin gained expertise and specialised in nuclear physics. At Daresbury, he trained British scientists in the field of nuclear physics.\n\nIn 1981, he became visiting professor of physics and mathematics at the University of Iowa and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, now Virginia Tech. In 1982, Riazuddin came back to Pakistan where he joined Quaid-e-Azam University as a professor of theoretical physics. In 1982, Riazuddin also went to Saudi Arabia where he joined King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals and became Chairman of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and also taught physics at the Department of Physics. In 1983, Riazuddin, along with Asghar Qadir, went to Trieste, Italy, to join the International Centre for Theoretical Physics. Both scientists joined Salam where they continued research in their fields. In 1998, Riazuddin left King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals and returned to Pakistan to rejoin PAEC.\n\nDuring his post-graduate research, Riazuddin made contributions to mathematical physics, as he was highly interested in complex mathematical series, and its relation to modern physics. In 1959, Riazuddin was the first physicist to use the dispersion relation for Compton scattering of virtual photons on pions to analyse their charge radius. For this contribution, he was awarded the doctorate in physics (theoretical) by Cambridge University. He seldom published papers, preferring long correspondences with his brother Fayyazuddin, mentor Abdus Salam, and colleagues including Asghar Qadir, Michael Duff, and Masud Ahmad. During the 1960s, he associated himself with complex mathematical applications of nuclear physics. In 1960, Riazuddin used Nucleon-nucleon dispersion relation to discriminate proton-proton scattering in pseudoscalar mesons. In 1965, Riazuddin carried out the pioneering work on vector currents, in which he showed the discrepancy between μ-decay and the constant gravity, and the strong interaction renormalisation of the Beta (β)-decay.\n\nThe same year, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, partnering with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, sponsored Riazuddin to undertake further research. Along with Munir Ahmad Rashid and Fayyazuddin, Riazuddin realised that the physical baryons are considered broken in special unitary groups, symmetric groups and the tensor product. The relevant papers were submitted at the United States Atomic Energy Commission. In 1967, at the Fermi Institute, Riazuddin, with his brother Fayyazuddin, carried out research in the field of current algebra, where they applied the mathematical framework of current algebra in the applications of radiative decays of mesons.\n\nIn 1982, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin published a pioneering work on K mesons. Riazuddin postulated that radioactive decay in K mesons have almost vanished when chiral symmetry is introduced. After the introduction, the symmetries break the Standard Model of particle physics, even when the contribution from penguin diagrams is included.\n\nFrom 1972, Riazuddin made pioneering research on neutrinos— an elusive particle postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930. In 1972, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin were the first to post mathematical frameworks of Current-algebra in neutrino scattering to determine the Scale invariance of Chiral symmetry breaking the Hamiltonian Quantum Mechanics.\nn 1987, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin theorised that it is possible get light-neutrino masses in the range of a few electron volts by equalising the masses of superheavy neutrinos in background independence (universality).\n\nIn 2000, Riazuddin began his research in the series unsolved problems in physics. In 2005, at the National Center for Physics (NCP), Riazuddin presented his papers on neutrinos where he provided the mathematical framework of the neutrinos. Neutrinos have heavier masses but the neutrino oscillations do not completely identify the overall scale of their exact masses because they are exceedingly tiny. To determine the exact masses, Riazuddin introduced the laws of limits, as he realised there was a limit, to the electron energy spectra in tritium β-decay. In 2007, Riazuddin introduced SU(3) symmetry in the theory of double beta decay. He postulated the light neutrinos formed a triplet state in a SU(3) symmetry during the process. In 2008, Riazuddin pointed out that the neutrino mass has μ and τ symmetry and the Lepton number remains constant, a new type of Seesaw mechanism is formed, the so-called Riazuddin's Seesaw Model, the Dirac mass matrix provided the Yukawa coupling to follow the Majorana fermion to satisfy the Leptogenesis asymmetry. Riazuddin proposed that this interaction can be avoided when two of the heavy right-hand neutrinos are (nearly) degenerate.\n\nIn 2009, Riazuddin published a mathematical theory of the non-standard model, and its brief extensions to τ (tau) particles — particles that are similar to electrons with negative electric charge. In an experiment performed at the Synchrotron light source installed at the National Center for Physics (NCP), now the Abdus Salam Centre for Physics, Riazuddin observed the decay of the Tau particle, in which he theorised that hadronisation vector currents and axial vectors can be used to study the implicit proprieties and functions of hadronic resonances, together with Chiral symmetry. These natural elements can be assigned to the parts' weak current that the strong nuclear interaction conserves. With the introduction of such elementary particles, it became critical to study the particle elements that hold the weak interaction.\n\nDuring his stay at PAEC, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin were central figures of Pakistan's atomic program during the early and critical years. In December 1972, Riazuddin returned to Pakistan on the request of Salam. Salam asked Riazuddin to report to Munir Ahmad Khan — chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission at that time. At PAEC, Salam assigned Riazuddin to his Theoretical Physics Group (TPG). The Theoretical Physics Group took research in fast neutron calculations — how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction – the theory simultaneity — how would fission weapon would detonated from several points at the same point during the detonation process – and hydrodynamics – how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave – and what kind of and how much fissile material and reflectors would be used. Salam had attracted theoretical physicists who worked under Riazuddin despite his younger age. Riazuddin was among the scientists who attended the Multan meeting that was managed by Salam and convened by Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. After the meeting, Salam took Riazuddin, with Munir Ahmad Khan, to Bhutto's residence in Islamabad where the scientists briefed Bhutto about the development of the nuclear weapons programme.\n\nAlthough Salam had traveled to the United States to evade the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, he returned to Pakistan with stacks of historical books on the Manhattan Project in December 1971. In December 1973, the University of Maryland offered him a fellowship, and on the advice of Salam, Riazuddin went to United States. There, he became a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland, and obtained the open-source information on the \"Manhattan Project\" from the Library of Congress. Riazuddin carefully studied American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer's approach to develop the first implosion device, and made further advances on Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, Oppenheimer-Phillips process, Born–Oppenheimer approximation.\n\nAfter his return from the United States, Riazuddin was inducted into the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) as member (technical). In 1974, he began to take research with the TPG, and began one of the pioneering member of the TPG. In 1973, Raziddin Siddiqui formed the Mathematical Physics Group (MPG) which closely collaborated with Theoretical Physics Group. Riazuddin called his mathematician friend Asghar Qadir, who specialised in special relativity under Riazuddin and Salam, to join the Mathematical Physics Group. Later in his career, Qadir published a college text book on theory of special relativity. Shortly after the India surprise nuclear test — Pokhran-I, Munir Ahmad Khan called for a meeting to initiate the work on atomic bomb. Riazuddin and Salam represented the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG), and it was decided to develop the implosion method for the first device. During the meeting, the word \"bomb\" was never used; instead academic scientists preferred to use the scientific research rationale. The Theoretical Physics Group began its research and directly reported to Abdus Salam.\n\nIn 1977 both MPG and TPG scientists completed the design and calculation of an atomic bomb. Along with Qadir, Riazuddin continued to develop the theoretical designs of the atomic weapon during 1978. In 1982 the PAEC finally developed the device under the leadership of Munir Ahmad Khan. The PAEC carried out the first cold-test of the TPG's theoretical design by May 1983 at Kirana Hills. The test teams were headed by Ishfaq Ahmad, a nuclear physicist, and Munir Ahmad Khan supervised the testings.\n\nRiazuddin later disclosed that he worked as part of the team, under Abdus Salam, that worked on designs for Pakistan's nuclear explosive device. As he explained:\n\nRiazuddin also worked in a neutron particle accelerator at PAEC. In 2000, Riazuddin retired from PAEC as a chief scientist. In the same year, he was elected as Fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences and Fellow of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences (IAS). Riazuddin was also a visiting scientist at CERN.\n\nRiazuddin was an internationally known theoretical physicist. He had made contributions with CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). At CERN, he was a widely respected theoretician. Riazuddin is the recipient of Pakistan's highest civil awards: Tamgha-i-Imtiaz, Sitara-i-Imtiaz, Hilal-i-Imtiaz. He is one of the who were very close to Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Abdus Salam. At PAEC, Riazuddin had closely worked with another noted Pakistani theoretical physicist Raziuddin Siddiqui (late). Later in life, he worked as a professor of theoretical physics and neutrino physics at the National University of Sciences and Technology, in Islamabad.\n\nHe had also been the director of the Riazuddin National Center for Physics, also at Quaid-e-Azam University. He was most famous for his TPG Group work Riazuddin and his team of theoretical physicists are widely credited to have developed and designed Pakistan's nuclear weapon devices.\n\nOn 26 April 2009, a day-long conference was held in Islamabad to pay tribute to an eminent research scientist and theoretical physicist, Riazuddin. The conference was organised by National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) and Riazuddin National Centre for Physics (RNCP). In the conference, Masud Ahmad, who is also the student of his, said:\n\n\"\"Prof. Riaz always put in his best efforts to obtain original results while working on various issues related to science and technology\".\n\nNUST Rector and a famous Pakistani aerospace engineer, Air Commodore Muhammad Asghar also paid tributes to him and said:\n\n\"Prof. Riazuddin has a very strong and professional background in the field of Physics. He achieved many distinctions and awards from national as well as international institutes, which includes Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, Sitara-i-Imtiaz and Hilal-e-Imtiaz and awards from UNESCO, Economic Cooperation Organization and COMSTECH Prize in Physics\"\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He believed that society would restructure itself by abandoning traditional ideas of temporal and spiritual power, an evolution that would lead, inevitably, to a productive society based on and benefiting from, a \" ... union of men engaged in useful work\"; the basis of \"true equality\".\n\nSaint-Simon's earliest publications, such as his \"Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XIXe siècle (Introduction to scientific discoveries of the 19th century)\" (1803) and his \"Mémoire sur la science de l'homme (Notes on the study of man)\" (1813), (the latter of which is a eulogy to Napoleon), demonstrate his faith in science as a means to regenerate society. In his 1814 essay \"De la réorganisation de la société européenne (On the reorganisation of European society)\", written in collaboration with his then secretary Augustin Thierry, Saint-Simon seems to have foreseen the European Union, expecting however that England would take the lead in forming a continent sharing the same laws and institutions.\n\nFor his last decade Saint-Simon concentrated on themes of political economy. Together with Auguste Comte, (then only a teenager), Saint-Simon projected a society bypassing the changes of the French Revolution, in which science and industry would take the moral and temporal power of medieval theocracy.\n\nIn his last work however, \"Le Nouveau Christianisme (The New Christianity)\" (1825), Saint-Simon reverted to more traditional ideas of renewing society through Christian brotherly love. He died shortly after its publication.\n\nIn his last years and in the period after his death, Saint-Simon's ideas, which gave prominence to art as a prized aspect of work, interested numerous artists and musicians, amongst them Hector Berlioz, Félicien David (who wrote a number of hymns for the movement) and Franz Liszt. For a brief period, the historian and writer Léon Halévy acted as secretary to the philosopher.\n\nFollowing Saint-Simon's death in 1825, his followers began to differ as to how to promulgate his ideas. A 'charismatic' faction, led by Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin, purchased the newspaper \"Le Globe\" as their official organ, and formed an increasingly religiously-minded ritualistic group based on a community founded at Ménilmontant, before being banned by the authorities in 1832. Following this some of Enfantin's followers visited Constantinople and then Egypt and influenced the creation of the Suez Canal in search of Messianic revelations, and the formal Saint-Simonian movement expired.\n\nHowever, others who had been associated with the group and were not so followers of Enfantin, (such as Olinde Rodrigues and Gustave d'Eichthal) developed Saint-Simonian notions practically and involved themselves in the development of the French economy, founding a number of leading concerns including the Suez Canal Company and the bank Crédit Mobilier.\n\nIt has also been noted that Saint-Simonian ideas exerted a significant influence on new religious movements such as Spiritualism and Occultism since the 1850s.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29537", "title": "Scientific misconduct", "text": "Scientific misconduct\n\nScientific misconduct is the violation of the standard codes of scholarly conduct and ethical behavior in the publication of professional scientific research. A \"Lancet\" review on \"Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries\" provides the following sample definitions: (reproduced in The COPE report 1999.)\n\nThe consequences of scientific misconduct can be damaging for perpetrators and journal audience and for any individual who exposes it. In addition there are public health implications attached to the promotion of medical or other interventions based on false or fabricated research findings.\n\nThree percent of the 3,475 research institutions that report to the US Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Research Integrity, indicate some form of scientific misconduct. However the ORI will only investigate allegations of impropriety where research was funded by federal grants. They routinely monitor such research publication for red flags and their investigation is subject to a statute of limitations. Other private organizations like the Committee of Medical Journal Editors (COJE) can only police their own members.\n\nThe validity of the methods and results of scientific papers are often scrutinized in journal clubs. In this venue, members can decide amongst themselves with the help of peers if a scientific paper's ethical standards are met.\n\nAccording to David Goodstein of Caltech, there are motivators for scientists to commit misconduct, which are briefly summarised here.\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation defines three types of research misconduct: fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism.\nOther types of research misconduct are also recognized:\n\nCompared to other forms of scientific misconduct, image fraud (manipulation of images to distort their meaning) is of particular interest since it can frequently be detected by external parties. In 2006, the \"Journal of Cell Biology\" gained publicity for instituting tests to detect photo manipulation in papers that were being considered for publication. This was in response to the increased usage of programs such as Adobe Photoshop by scientists, which facilitate photo manipulation. Since then more publishers, including the Nature Publishing Group, have instituted similar tests and require authors to minimize and specify the extent of photo manipulation when a manuscript is submitted for publication. However, there is little evidence to indicate that such tests are applied rigorously. One Nature paper published in 2009 has subsequently been reported to contain around 20 separate instances of image fraud.\n\nAlthough the type of manipulation that is allowed can depend greatly on the type of experiment that is presented and also differ from one journal to another, in general the following manipulations are not allowed:\n\nAll authors of a scientific publication are expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted to academic journals for publication.\n\nSimultaneous submission of scientific findings to more than one journal or duplicate publication of findings is usually regarded as misconduct, under what is known as the Ingelfinger rule, named after the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine 1967-1977, Franz Ingelfinger.\n\nGuest authorship (where there is stated authorship in the absence of involvement, also known as gift authorship) and ghost authorship (where the real author is not listed as an author) are commonly regarded as forms of research misconduct. In some cases coauthors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of Gerald Schatten who co-authored with Hwang Woo-Suk, the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce, (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce's deception) – and the coauthors with Jan Hendrik Schön at Bell Laboratories. More recent cases include that of Charles Nemeroff, then the editor-in-chief of \"Neuropsychopharmacology\", and a well-documented case involving the drug Actonel.\n\nAuthors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. The failure to keep data may be regarded as misconduct. Some scientific journals require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors might have commercial or non-commercial conflicts of interest. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about ethical aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies (Nemeroff, Blumsohn).\n\nIn general, defining whether an individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, the more likely it is that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.\n\nWell publicised cases illustrate the potential role that senior academics in research institutions play in concealing scientific misconduct. A King's College (London) internal investigation showed research findings from one of their researchers to be 'at best unreliable, and in many cases spurious' but the college took no action, such as retracting relevant published research or preventing further episodes from occurring. It was only 10 years later, when an entirely separate form of misconduct by the same individual was being investigated by the General Medical Council, that the internal report came to light.\n\nIn a more recent case an internal investigation at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune determined that there was evidence of misconduct by Dr. Gopal Kundu, but an external committee was then organised which dismissed the allegation, and the NCCS issued a memorandum exonerating the authors of all charges of misconduct. Undeterred by the NCCS exoneration, the relevant journal (\"Journal of Biological Chemistry\") withdrew the paper based on its own analysis.\n\nSome academics believe that scientific colleagues who suspect scientific misconduct should consider taking informal action themselves, or reporting their concerns. This question is of great importance since much research suggests that it is very difficult for people to act or come forward when they see unacceptable behavior, unless they have help from their organizations. A \"User-friendly Guide,\" and the existence of a confidential organizational ombudsman may help people who are uncertain about what to do, or afraid of bad consequences for their speaking up.\n\nJournals are responsible for safeguarding the research record and hence have a critical role in dealing with suspected misconduct. This is recognised by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) which has issued clear guidelines on the form (e.g. retraction) that concerns over the research record should take.\n\nEvidence emerged in 2012 that journals learning of cases where there is strong evidence of possible misconduct, with issues potentially affecting a large portion of the findings, frequently fail to issue an expression of concern or correspond with the host institution so that an investigation can be undertaken. In one case the Journal of Clinical Oncology issued a Correction despite strong evidence that the original paper was invalid. \nIn another case, Nature allowed a Corrigendum to be published despite clear evidence of image fraud. Subsequent Retraction of the paper required the actions of an independent whistleblower.\n\nThe cases of Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii in anaesthesiology focussed attention on the role that journals play in perpetuating scientific fraud as well as how they can deal with it. In the Boldt case, the Editors-in-Chief of 18 specialist journals (generally anaesthesia and intensive care) made a joint statement regarding 88 published clinical trials conducted without Ethics Committee approval. In the Fujii case, involving nearly 200 papers, the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia, which published 24 of Fujii's papers, has accepted that its handling of the issue was inadequate. Following publication of a Letter to the Editor from Kranke and colleagues in April 2000, along with a non-specific response from Dr. Fujii, there was no follow-up on the allegation of data manipulation and no request for an institutional review of Dr. Fujii's research. Anesthesia & Analgesia went on to publish 11 additional manuscripts by Dr. Fujii following the 2000 allegations of research fraud, with Editor Steven Shafer stating in March 2012 that subsequent submissions to the Journal by Dr. Fujii should not have been published without first vetting the allegations of fraud. In April 2012 Shafer led a group of editors to write a joint statement, in the form of an ultimatum made available to the public, to a large number of academic institutions where Fujii had been employed, offering these institutions the chance to attest to the integrity of the bulk of the allegedly fraudulent papers.\n\nThe consequences of scientific fraud vary based on the severity of the fraud, the level of notice it receives, and how long it goes undetected. For cases of fabricated evidence, the consequences can be wide-ranging, with others working to confirm (or refute) the false finding, or with research agendas being distorted to address the fraudulent evidence. The Piltdown Man fraud is a case in point: The significance of the bona-fide fossils that were being found was muted for decades because they disagreed with Piltdown Man and the preconceived notions that those faked fossils supported. In addition, the prominent paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward spent time at Piltdown each year until he died, trying to find more Piltdown Man remains. The misdirection of resources kept others from taking the real fossils more seriously and delayed the reaching of a correct understanding of human evolution. (The Taung Child, which should have been the death knell for the view that the human brain evolved first, was instead treated very critically because of its disagreement with the Piltdown Man evidence.)\n\nIn the case of Prof Don Poldermans, the misconduct occurred in reports of trials of treatment to prevent death and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing operations. The trial reports were relied upon to issue guidelines that applied for many years across North America and Europe.\n\nIn the case of Dr Alfred Steinschneider, two decades and tens of millions of research dollars were lost trying to find the elusive link between infant sleep apnea, which Steinschneider said he had observed and recorded in his laboratory, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), of which he stated it was a precursor. The cover was blown in 1994, 22 years after Steinschneider's 1972 \"Pediatrics\" paper claiming such an association, when Waneta Hoyt, the mother of the patients in the paper, was arrested, indicted and convicted on five counts of second-degree murder for the smothering deaths of her five children. While that in itself was bad enough, the paper, presumably written as an attempt to save infants' lives, ironically was ultimately used as a defense by parents suspected in multiple deaths of their own children in cases of Münchausen syndrome by proxy. The 1972 \"Pediatrics\" paper was cited in 404 papers in the interim and is still listed on Pubmed without comment.\n\nThe potentially severe consequences for individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research. This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct. Persons who expose such cases, commonly called whistleblowers, can find themselves open to retaliation by a number of different means. These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters – designed to protect those who raise concerns. A whistleblower is almost always alone in their fight – their career becomes completely dependent on the decision about alleged misconduct. If the accusations prove false, their career is completely destroyed, but even in case of positive decision the career of the whistleblower can be under question: their reputation of \"troublemaker\" will prevent many employers from hiring them. There is no international body where a whistleblower could give their concerns. If a university fails to investigate suspected fraud or provides a fake investigation to save their reputation the whistleblower has no right of appeal.\n\nWith the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of plagiarism and multiple publication within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Dr. Harold Garner's laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas is Déjà vu, an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication. All of the entries in the database were discovered through the use of text data mining algorithm eTBLAST, also created in Dr. Garner's laboratory. The creation of Déjà vu and the subsequent classification of several hundred articles contained therein have ignited much discussion in the scientific community concerning issues such as ethical behavior, journal standards, and intellectual copyright. Studies on this database have been published in journals such as \"Nature\" and \"Science\", among others.\n\nOther tools which may be used to detect fraudulent data include error analysis. Measurements generally have a small amount of error, and repeated measurements of the same item will generally result in slight differences in readings. These differences can be analyzed, and follow certain known mathematical and statistical properties. Should a set of data appear to be too faithful to the hypothesis, i.e., the amount of error that would normally be in such measurements does not appear, a conclusion can be drawn that the data may have been forged. Error analysis alone is typically not sufficient to prove that data have been falsified or fabricated, but it may provide the supporting evidence necessary to confirm suspicions of misconduct.\n\nKirby Lee and Lisa Bero suggest, \"Although reviewing raw data can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, having such a policy would hold authors more accountable for the accuracy of their data and potentially reduce scientific fraud or misconduct.\"\n\nAndrew Wakefield, who claimed links between the MMR vaccine, autism and inflammatory bowel disease.

{"id": "178756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178756", "title": "Starhawk", "text": "Starhawk\n\nStarhawk (born Miriam Simos on June 17, 1951) is an American writer, teacher and activist. She is known as a theorist of feminist Neopaganism and ecofeminism. She is a columnist for Beliefnet.com and for \"On Faith\", the \"Newsweek\"/\"Washington Post\" online forum on religion. \nStarhawk's book \"The Spiral Dance\" (1979) was one of the main inspirations behind the Goddess movement.\nIn 2012, she was listed in Watkins' \"Mind Body Spirit\" magazine as one of the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People.\n\nStarhawk was born in 1951 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Her father Jack Simos, died when she was five. Her mother, Bertha Claire Goldfarb Simos, was a professor of social work at UCLA. Both her parents were the children of Jewish immigrants from Russia.\n\nIn high school she and fellow feminist Christina Hoff Sommers were best friends. Starhawk received a BA in Fine Arts from UCLA. In 1973, while she was a graduate student in film there, she won the Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award for her novel, \"A Weight of Gold\", a story about Venice, California, where she then lived. She received an MA in Psychology, with a concentration in feminist therapy, from Antioch University West in 1982.\n\nFollowing her years at UCLA, after a failed attempt to become a fiction writer in New York City, Starhawk returned to California. She became active in the Neopagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, and trained with Victor Anderson, founder of the Feri Tradition of witchcraft, and with Zsuzsanna Budapest, a feminist separatist involved in Dianic Wicca.\n\nShe wrote a book, \"The Spiral Dance\", on Goddess religion, which she finished in 1977 but was unable to publish at first. Feminist religious scholar Carol P. Christ included an article on witchcraft and the Goddess movement in the anthology \"Womanspirit Rising\" (1979). Christ put Starhawk in touch with an editor at Harper & Row, who eventually published the book.\n\nFirst published in 1979, \"The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess\" became a best-selling book about Neopagan belief and practice. A 10th-anniversary edition was published in 1989, followed by a 20th-anniversary edition in 1999. The original text of \"The Spiral Dance\" was left largely intact for these editions, expanded primarily by introductions and commentaries reflecting on the book's origins, the rituals described, and the evolution of the author's beliefs and practices. Since its publication, \"The Spiral Dance\" has become a classic resource on Wicca and modern witchcraft, spiritual feminism, the Goddess movement, and ecofeminism. The work is distinguished by its visionary mysticism, \"broad philosophy of harmony with nature,\" and ecstatic consciousness.\n\n\"'What do we do...those of us who do believe the earth is sacred, who do believe that we have a responsibility to care for the living systems that sustain us, and who do believe that we have a responsibility to take care of each other?'\" Starhawk believes that the Earth is a living entity, and that faith-based activism can reconnect oneself to basic human needs. She posits core religious values of community and self-sacrifice as important to eco-pagan movements, as well as the broader environmental justice movement.\n\nStarhawk advocates combining social justice issues with a nature-based spirituality that begins with spending time in the natural world, saying that doing so \"...can open up your understanding on deeper and more subtle levels where the natural world will speak to you.\"\nStarhawk's activism is deeply rooted in an anti-war philosophy, as she believes that war teaches one to see people culturally different than themselves as inhuman and dangerous.\nStarhawk has written extensively on activism, including advice for activist organizers, examinations of white privilege within radical communities, and calls for an intersectionality of fighting oppression that includes spirituality, eco-consciousness, and sexual and gender liberation.\n\nStarhawk's feminism and spirituality are closely interconnected, and her belief that feminism should challenge power structures denotes her intersectional approach. Her ecofeminism links life-giving Mother Nature with the life-giving of women through birth, as well as the link between ecological destruction and patriarchal oppression under male-dominated Western political economies.\nShe calls for a reconceptualization of the way we think about power that is different from what she posits as our typical understanding of 'power over' others, and believes that patriarchal systems of oppression are dying out and will be replaced by more egalitarian structures that have existed previously with many women in positions of power, including as priestesses, poets, healers, singers, and seers. Such matrilineal lineages, she argues, have been erased from history because of their \"political implications.\"\n\nStarhawk argues that our patriarchal culture of domination has confused the erotic with domination and violence. Sexuality, she says, \"...is sacred because through it we make a connection with another self — but it is misused and perverted when it becomes an arena of power-over, a means of treating another — or oneself — as an object.\" Such analyses of gendered power relations are explored in her books \"Webs of Power: Notes from the Global Uprising\" (2003) and \"Truth or Dare: Encounters with Power, Authority and Mystery\" (1998). In the latter, Starhawk links the rise of kinship to patriarchal domination, and traces a psychology of liberation in analyzing an oppressor she argues is embedded deeply in all of us, the 'Self-hater.' Again, Starhawk is interested in how such oppressions can be reformed into new sources of power, particularly amongst women, that arise innately and reject dominion over others.\n\nStarhawk's feminist writings have been used to analyze the differences between mainstream rhetoric and feminist rhetoric, particularly in relation to her motive of writing rhetoric as revealing immanent truths rather than being utilized for persuasion. This latter purpose of mainstream rhetoric is viewed by Starhawk as adhering to patriarchal logic, and her vision of 'empowered action' – which involves rejecting the tenets of the oppressive system and then openly challenging them – attempts to transform persuasive mainstream rhetoric to immanent feminist rhetoric.\n\nIn 1979, partly to commemorate the publication of \"The Spiral Dance\", Starhawk and her friends staged a public celebration of the Neopagan holiday of Samhain (Halloween) incorporating an actual spiral dance. This group became the Reclaiming Collective, and their annual Spiral Dance ritual now draws hundreds of participants.\n\nStarhawk continues to work with Reclaiming, a tradition of Witchcraft that she co-founded. This now international organization offers classes, workshops, camps, and public rituals in earth-based spirituality, with the goal to \"unify spirit and politics\".\n\nShe also works internationally as a trainer in nonviolence and direct action, and as an activist within the peace movement, women's movement, environmental movement, and anti-globalization movement. She travels and teaches widely in North America, Europe and the Middle East, giving lectures and workshops.\n\nShe was influential in the decision by the Unitarian Universalist Association to include earth-centered traditions among their sources of faith. She led numerous workshops for, and was an active member of The Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans (CUUPS), an interest group of Unitarians honoring goddess-based, earth-centered, tribal, and pagan spiritual paths.\n\nStarhawk has taught in several San Francisco Bay Area colleges and universities, including John F. Kennedy University, Antioch University West, the Institute of Culture and Creation Spirituality at Holy Names University, and Wisdom University. She is presently adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and is currently affiliated with United for Peace and Justice, the RANT trainers' collective, Earth Activist Training, and other groups.\n\nStarhawk has written a number of books, and has also contributed works in other media. Her works have appeared in translation in Spanish, French, German, Danish, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Czech, Greek, Japanese, and Burmese.\n\n\n\n\nStarhawk has contributed to films:\n\n\nShe participated in the Reclaiming CDs \"Chants: Ritual Music\", and recorded the guided meditation \"Way to the Well\".\n\nOn YouTube Starhawk speaks on spirituality and activism at UUA. She also wrote the call-to-action for the women's peace organization \"Code Pink\".\n\nStarhawk married Edwin Rahsman in 1977. They subsequently divorced. She is currently married to David Miller, and they live in San Francisco. Starhawk also resides partly in \nSonoma, California.\n\nStarhawk identifies as bisexual, and has also commented that her sexuality is fluid and \"has something to do with a deep reluctance to be pinned down.\" Her writing and activism promotes equality for people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the custodian of the Shrine of Ghous-e-Azam Abdul-Qadir Gilani and has been accepted by many as a reformer of Tassawwuf and Tariqat. Born in Baghdad on 18 June 1932, he traces his lineage by seventeen steps to Abdul-Qadir Gilani and 28 steps to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nIn 1956, Al-Gillani left Baghdad and migrated to Pakistan, where he settled permanently in Quetta. He stayed in Pakistan until he died in June 1991 in Germany, and later on he was buried in Lahore, Pakistan. He had three sons, AlSyed Mahmood Mohyuddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri, AlSyed Abdul Qadir Jamaluddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri and AlSyed Muhammad Ziauddin Al-Gillani Al-Qadri, who propagate the teachings of Silsilah e Qadiriyya Tahiria.\n\nAl-Gillani came from an Iraqi family who are the custodians of the mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. He is the youngest of the six sons of Naqeeb-ul-Ashraaf Mahmood Hussamuddin al-Gillani al-Qadri. His grandfather, Naqeeb-ul-Ashraaf Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani, was the first Prime Minister of Iraq (11 November 1920 – 20 November 1922) following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The current Custodian of the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani is his elder-brother, Naqib ul Ashraaf AlSyed Ahmed Zafar Al-Gillani, who also served as the ambassador of Iraq in Pakistan from 1978 until 1992.\n\nAs a child, Al-Gillani would spend the entire night alone in seclusion at the shrine of his ancestor Shaykh Abdul Qadir Gilani. He received his spiritual training and mentoring directly from his father Naqeeb-ul-Ashraaf Alsyed Mahmood Hussamuddin AlGillani Al-Qadri, who was a Sufi and the custodian of the mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. Al-Gillani completed his other traditional religious studies at the Madrassa of Syed Sultan Ali in Baghdad, where he studied under scholars of Iraq including Syed Ali Afridi, Qasim alQaise, Khalil ar-Ravee and the Grand Mufti of Iraq.\n\nIn 1956, Al-Gillani left the city of Baghdad and migrated to Pakistan after receiving spiritual orders from Abdul Qadir Gilani. Al-Gillani first completed 40 days seclusion (Chilla) at the Shrine of the Sufi saint Data Ganj Baksh Ali Hujwiri in Lahore. He then settled in Quetta, where he established the Darbar-e-Ghousia religious school. In honour of Al-Gilani's presence, the government of Balochistan renamed the road to Al-Gillani Road. Darbar-e-Ghousia became the official headquarters of Tariqa Qadiria in the sub-continent and is still run by the sons of Al-Gillani.\n\nHe received a personal visit from President General Ayub Khan, to welcome him to Pakistan. General Ayub Khan pledged Baith (Oath of Allegiance) in the Qadiriyya Tariqa at the hands of Al-Gillani. Al-Gillani was visited by presidents, politicians, tribal leaders and religious scholars for his prayers, advice and guidance. Pakistani President Zia ul Haq is also known to have had both pledged Baith on Al-Gillani’s hands, whilst leaders such as President Saddam Hussein, the Sultan of Brunei, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Mian Nawaz Shareef, would visit him or stay in contact.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his ancestor Abdul Qadir Gilani, Al-Gillani spent the majority of his life in Khalwa (spiritual seclusion) and undertaking Mujahida (spiritual exercises). There is little known about Al-Gillani's life as he would strictly forbid his followers from writing about him. Al-Gillani was very strict in adherence to the laws of Shariah and Tariqah, and until he died he worked tirelessly at propagating the teachings of his ancestor Abdul Qadir Gilani and the other Mashaikh of the Qadiriyya path. He encouraged Islamic Unity and would often speak out against acts which were considered bad innovations and rituals that had crept inside Tassawuf \n\nSince a young age, he began touring across the world for propagating Islam and the teachings of Tariqa Qadiria. His visits included Saudi Arabia, India, Bangladesh, United Kingdom, Germany, Egypt, Canada, Indonesia, Singapore, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sri Lanka and the Gulf States. During Al-Gillani’s visit of Ceylon in 1958, he established a care-home in Ceylon for needy and orphaned children.\n\nWhen Al-Gillani visited India in 1952, he visited the city of Bareilly on the invitation of Mufti Muhammad Mustafa Raza Khan Noori Qadri, the Grand Mufti of India. When Al-Gillani reached Bareilly, his car was lifted by the hundreds of thousands of devotees and carried to the residence of Mufti Mustafa Raza Khan. It is reported that Mufti Mustafa Raza Khan was so respectful of Al-Gillani that he remained barefoot for the duration of his stay and would stand to serve him. On this occasion, Maulana Mustafa Raza Khan also made several of his family members pledge Baith on the hands of Al-Gillani including the current Grand Mufti of India Mufti Akhtar Raza Khan Qadri al-Azhari. During this visit to India, Al-Gillani was visited by the heads of major Sufi Tariqas situated here, including Abdul Qadeer Badayuni Qadri and Muhammad Abdul Qadeer Siddiqi Qadri.\n\nIn the 1960s, Al-Gillani was invited to the city of Faisalabad by the grand scholar of Pakistan Muhadith e Azam e Pakistan Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri to attend the opening ceremony of Jamia Rizvia. To welcome Al-Gillani and for his protocol, Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri arranged for rolls of white silk to be spread the entire journey from his Madrassa to the Railway Station. It is reported that a small spot had been left uncovered near the door of the Madrassa and Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri kneeled down and used his own beard to sweep this area clean.\n\nAfter a three storey stage was erected, Al-Gillani was seated at the top and covered in rose petals, and Maulana Sardar Ahmed Qadri and other Mashaikh sat beneath his feet on the second storey and Maulana Sardar Ahmed placed his own sons and students on the last level. At the conclusion of the gathering, the crowds were un-controllable as they rushed in the hope of meeting or touching Al-Gilani so Maulana Sardar Ahmed ordered for a side wall had to be demolished so Al-Gillani could leave safely.\n\nAl-Gillani would be invited as 'Main Guest' to conferences and events, being held both nationally and internationally. These include the International Khatm e Nabuwat Conference held at Minar e Pakistan, the inauguration of Minhaj-ul-Quran International held at Lahore in 1984, the International Minhaj-ul-Quran Conference held at Lahore in 1987, the Al-Hejaz Conference held in London and the historic International Minhaj ul Quran Conference held at Wembley Arena, London in 1988 \n\nAl-Gillani married HRH the Princess of Kalat Princess Munawar Sultan – the daughter of HRH Khan-e-Azzam Mir Ahmad Yaar Khan of Kalat. From this marriage, Tahir Allauddin Al-Qadri Al-Gillani has three Sons and Three Daughters.\n\nThe three sons follow in the footsteps of their father and ancestors and have devoted their lives for the propagation of Tariqa e Qadiriah. For this purpose, they visit places across Pakistan and beyond and administer Baith in Silsilah e Qadiria Tahiria.\n\nIn 2007, Al-Gillani’s Son AlSyed Muhammad Ziauddin Al-Qadri Al-Gillani inaugurated Darbar-e-Ghousia Qadiria Tahiria in Bradford, England. This Darbar is run under the guidance of Syed Khalid Ali Tahiri Qadri (Sajjada Nasheen Darbar-e-Ghousia Qadiria Tahiria UK) after receiving approval from all three sons of Al-Gillani. Syed Khalid Ali Tahiri Qadri is one of the closest students of Al-Gilani and has received his spiritual training and authorisation directly from him. He began serving Al-Gilani at a young age, and was appointed as personal tutor to AlSyed Muhammad Ziauddin Al-Qadri Al-Gillani during in his childhood. Syed Khalid Tahiri is the only representative of al-Gillani in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States.\n\nIn 2011, AlSyed Muhammad Ziauddin Al-Qadri Al-Gillani visited Bradford for a second occasion, where he presided over a conference that has been held annually by Syed Khalid Ali Tahiri to commemorate the death anniversary of his Shaykh AlSyed Tahir Allauddin Al-Gillani During this visit, he also visited Darbar-e-Ghousia Qadiria Tahiria UK and the residence of Syed Khalid Ali Tahiri.\n\nAl-Gillani authored books during his stay in Pakistan. Some of his books are:\n\n"}

His mother was an actress who worked in the theatre of Vsevolod Meyerhold. His childhood was clouded by disease and war, especially in Tashkent.\n\nIvanov was educated at Moscow University and worked there until 1958, when he was fired on account of his sympathy with Boris Pasternak and Roman Jakobson.

Austin, in which the author attempts to establish links between the neurological workings of the human brain and meditation. The eventual goal would be to establish mechanisms by which meditation induces changes in the activity of the brain, which in turn induces a state of mental clarity. For example, Austin presents evidence from EEG scans that deep relaxed breathing reduces brain activity.\n\nThe publishers described their book as a \"Comprehensive text on the evidence from neuroscience that helps to clarify which brain mechanisms underlie the subjective states of Zen, and employs Zen to 'illuminate' how the brain works in various states of consciousness\". Austin starts with a discussion of Zen Buddhism, its goals, and practices. Having laid this groundwork, he then turns to explore the neurological basis of consciousness.\n\nAustin wrote a follow-up, \"Zen-Brain Reflections\".\n\n\n\n"}
