Abstract objects have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in philosophy and semantics. Abstract objects are sometimes called abstracta (sing. abstractum) and concrete objects are sometimes called \"concreta\" (sing. \"concretum\"). An abstract object is an object that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a type of thing—i.e., an idea, or abstraction. The term \"abstract object\" is said to have been coined by Willard Van Orman Quine. The study of abstract objects is called abstract object theory.\n\nThe type–token distinction identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing. The \"type\" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract-concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:\n\nAbstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In ontology, abstract objects are considered problematic for physicalism and some forms of naturalism. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the problem of universals. In epistemology, abstract objects are considered problematic for empiricism. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. \n\nSome, such as Edward Zalta and arguably, Plato in his Theory of Forms, have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of metaphysics or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. \n\nIn modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel.\n\nGottlob Frege said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a third realm, different from the external world or from internal consciousness. \n\nAnother popular proposal for drawing the abstract-concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any causal powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract-concrete distinction, follow the link below to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia\" article.\n\nJean Piaget uses the terms \"concrete\" and \"formal\" to describe the different types of learning. Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract (formal operational) thinking involves a mental process.\nRecently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of social ontology and documentality. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexisting because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible. Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives). These characteristics are exhibited by a number of social objects, including states of the international legal system.\n\n"}

{"id": "293226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293226", "title": "Analects", "text": "Analects\n\nThe Analects (; Old Chinese: \"*run ŋ(r)aʔ\"; ), also known as the Analects of Confucius, is a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled and written by Confucius's followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the \"Analects\" was considered merely a \"commentary\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the \"Analects\" grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. \n\nDuring the late Song dynasty (960–1279) the importance of the \"Analects\" as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \"Four Books\". The \"Analects\" has been one of the most widely-read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today.\n\nConfucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through \"ren\", and that the most basic step to cultivating \"ren\" was devotion to one's parents and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires do not need to be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via rituals and forms of propriety, through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of virtue was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.\n\nAccording to Ban Gu, writing in the \"Book of Han\", the \"Analects\" originated as individual records kept by Confucius's disciples of conversations between the Master and them, which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius's death in 479 BC. The work is therefore titled \"Lunyu\" meaning \"edited conversations\" or \"selected speeches\" (i.e. analects). This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars, for example the Song dynasty neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stated that \"Analects\" is the records of Confucius's first- and second-generation pupils. The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty philologist Cui Shu (崔述, 1740–1816) who argued on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work. Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years, with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings. Because no texts of the \"Analects\" have been discovered earlier, and because the \"Analects\" was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text's compilation.\n\nRegardless of how early the text of the \"Analects\" existed, most \"Analects\" scholars believe that, by the early Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form, and the book acquired its final, complete form during Han dynasty. A Han dynasty writer Wang Chong however claimed that the \"Analects\" that existed during the Han dynasty was incomplete and formed only a part of a much larger work. A larger collection of Confucius's teachings existed in the Warring States period than has been preserved directly in the \"Analects\": 75% of Confucius's sayings cited by his second-generation student, Mencius, do not exist in the received text of the \"Analects\".\n\nAccording to the Han dynasty scholar Liu Xiang, there were two versions of the \"Analects\" that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the \"Lu version\" and the \"Qi version\". The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters. In the reign of Emperor Jing of Han (r. 157–141 BC), a third version (the \"Old Text\" version) was discovered hidden in a wall of the home then believed to be Confucius's when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu (r. 153–128 BC) in order to expand the king's palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different. The old text version got its name because it was written in characters not used since the earlier Warring States period (i.e. before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden. According to the Han dynasty scholar Huan Tan, the old text version had four hundred characters different from the Lu version (from which the received text of the \"Analects\" is mostly based), and it seriously differed from the Lu version in twenty-seven places. Of these twenty-seven differences, the received text only agrees with the old text version in two places.\n\nOver a century later, the tutor of the \"Analects\" to Emperor Cheng of Han, (d. 5 BC), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions by taking the Lu version as authoritative and selectively adding sections from the Qi version, and produced a composite text of the \"Analects\" known as the \"Zhang Hou Lun\". This text was recognized by Zhang Yu's contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the \"Analects\" today. The Qi version was lost for about 1800 years but re-found during the excavation of the tomb of Marquis of Haihun that was found 2011. No complete copies of either the Lu version or the old text version of the \"Analects\" exist today, though fragments of the old text version were discovered at Dunhuang.\n\nBefore the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the \"Analects\" known to scholars was found in the \"Stone Classics of the Xinping Era\", a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern Han dynasty capital of Luoyang around 175 AD. Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the \"Analects\" that were written around 50 BC, during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the \"Dingzhou \"Analects\"\", and the \"Pyongyang \"Analects\"\", after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou \"Analects\" was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang \"Analects\" was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang \"Analects\" has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.\n\nThe Dingzhou \"Analects\" was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in an earthquake shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the \"Analects\". Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou \"Analects\" is shorter than the received \"Analects\", implying that the text of the \"Analects\" was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou \"Analects\" was entombed. There was evidence that \"additions\" may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the \"Analects\" and included \"extra\" material for the sake of completeness. The content of the Pyongyang \"Analects\" is similar to the Dingzhou \"Analects\"; but, because of the secrecy and isolationism of the North Korean government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou \"Analects\" or the Pyongyang \"Analects\" represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.\n\nDuring most of the Han period the \"Analects\" was not considered one of the principal texts of Confucianism. During the reign of Han Wudi (141–87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the Five Classics were considered by the government to be canonical (\"jing\"). They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The \"Analects\" was considered secondary as it was thought to be merely a collection of Confucius's oral \"commentary\" (\"zhuan\") on the Five Classics.\n\nThe political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the Eastern Han the \"Analects\" was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and often read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han, the heir apparent was provided a tutor specifically to teach him the \"Analects\". The growing importance of the \"Analects\" was recognized when the Five Classics was expanded to the \"Seven Classics\": the Five Classics plus the \"Analects\" and the \"Classic of Filial Piety\", and its status as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late Song dynasty (960–1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the Four Books by Zhu Xi and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.\n\nSince the Han dynasty, Chinese readers have interpreted the \"Analects\" by reading scholars' commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the \"Analects\" since the Han dynasty, but the two which have been most influential have been the \"Collected Explanations of the Analects\" (\"Lunyu Jijie\") by He Yan (c. 195–249) and several colleagues, and the \"Collected Commentaries of the Analects\" (\"Lunyu Jizhu\") by Zhu Xi (1130–1200). In his work, He Yan collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized what he believed to be the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the \"Analects\" which had been produced by earlier Han and Wei dynasty (220–265 AD) scholars. His personal interpretation of the \"Lunyu\" was guided by his belief that Daoism and Confucianism complemented each other, so that by studying both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, he argued that \"Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage\" (sic). The \"Explanations\" was written in 248 AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the \"Analects\" for nearly 1,000 years, until the early Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the \"Analects\" that still exists.\n\nHe Yan's commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi's commentary. Zhu Xi's work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu's work took part in the context of a period of renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single \"correct\" intellectual orthodoxy that would \"save\" Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation.\n\nIn his commentary Zhu made a great effort to interpret the \"Analects\" by using theories elaborated in the other Four Books, something that He Yan had not done. Zhu attempted to give an added coherence and unity to the message of the \"Analects\", demonstrating that the individual books of the Confucian canon gave meaning to the whole, just as the whole of the canon gave meaning to its parts. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated, \"[T]he \"Analects\" and the \"Mencius\" are the most important works for students pursuing the Way [...] The words of the \"Analects\" are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one's] nature.\" From the first publication of the \"Commentaries\", Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century, the Chinese government endorsed Zhu's commentary, and until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the \"Analects\" by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.\n\nVery few reliable sources about Confucius exist besides that of the Analects. The principal biography available to historians is included in Sima Qian's \"Shiji\", but, because the \"Shiji\" contains a large amount of (possibly legendary) material not confirmed by extant sources, the biographical material on Confucius found in the \"Analects\" makes the \"Analects\" arguably the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius. Confucius viewed himself as a \"transmitter\" of social and political traditions originating in the early Zhou dynasty (c. 1000–800 BC), and claimed not to have originated anything (\"Analects\" 7.1), but Confucius's social and political ideals were not popular in his time.\n\nConfucius's discussions on the nature of the supernatural (\"Analects\" 3.12; 6.20; 11.11) indicate that he believed while \"ghosts\" and \"spirits\" should be respected, they are best kept at a distance. Instead human beings should base their values and social ideals on moral philosophy, tradition, and a natural love for others. Confucius's social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of \"ren\" by every individual in a community. Later Confucian philosophers explained \"ren\" as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words \"humane\", \"altruistic\", or \"benevolent\", but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses \"ren\" in the \"Analects\", very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term \"ren\" to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely. (This use of the term \"ren\" is peculiar to the \"Analects\".)\n\nThroughout the \"Analects\", Confucius's students frequently request that Confucius define \"ren\" and give examples of people who embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students' questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours that are associated with \"ren\" and explaining how a person could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of \"ren\" would speak carefully and modestly (\"Analects\" 12.3); be resolute and firm (\"Analects\" 12.20), courageous (\"Analects\" 14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (\"Analects\" 9.28; 6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (\"Analects\" 12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (\"Analects\" 17.6); and love others (\"Analects\" 12.22). Confucius recognized his followers' disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of \"ren\", but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (\"Analects\" 7.23).\n\nTo Confucius, the cultivation of \"ren\" involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one's own character (\"Analects\" 1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated \"ren\" could be distinguished by their being \"simple in manner and slow of speech.\" He believed that people could cultivate their sense of \"ren\" through exercising the inverted Golden Rule: \"Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself\"; \"a man with \"ren\", desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed\" (\"Analects\" 12.2; 6.28). He taught that the ability of people to imagine and project themselves into the places of others was a crucial quality for the pursuit of moral self-cultivation (\"Analects\" 4.15; see also 5.12; 6.30; 15.24). Confucius regarded the exercise of devotion to one's parents and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate \"ren\". (\"Analects\" 1.2).\n\nConfucius believed that \"ren\" could best be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by practicing and cultivating one's understanding of \"li\": rituals and forms of propriety through which people demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society (\"Analects\" 3.3). Confucius said that one's understanding of \"li\" should inform everything that one says and does (\"Analects\" 12.1). He believed that subjecting oneself to \"li\" did not mean suppressing one's desires, but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one's family and broader community. By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of \"li\" was the basis of a well-ordered society (\"Analects\" 2.3). Confucius taught his students that an important aspect of \"li\" was observing the practical social differences that exist between people in daily life. In Confucian philosophy these \"five relationships\" include: ruler to ruled; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother; and friend to friend.\n\n\"Ren\" and \"li\" have a special relationship in the \"Analects\": \"li\" manages one's relationship with one's family and close community, while \"ren\" is practiced broadly and informs one's interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of \"ren\" and \"li\" meant that rulers could oppress their subjects only at their own peril: \"You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion\" (\"Analects\" 9.26). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (\"Analects\" 15.8).\n\nConfucius's political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord\" (\"Analects\" 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius's political theories were directly contradictory to the Legalistic political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.\n\nConfucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China's ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles of which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of Qi asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: \"Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son\" (\"Analects\" 12.11). Confucius's analysis of the need to raise officials' behavior to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the rectification of names, and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (\"Analects\" 13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all who were under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (\"Analects\" 12.19).\n\nConfucius judged a good ruler by his possession of \"de\" (\"virtue\"): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (\"Analects\" 2.1). Confucius said that one of the most important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of \"de\" is through a devotion to the correct practices of \"li\". Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's \"de\" include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.\n\nThe importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the \"Analects\". For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity (\"Analects\" 7.22). Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection (\"Analects\" 2.15). When teaching he is never cited in the \"Analects\" as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through asking direct questions, citing passages from the classics, and using analogies (\"Analects\" 7.8). He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. (\"Analects\" 3.8)\n\nHis primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things (\"Analects\" 12.11; see also 13.3). He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn (\"Analects\" 7.7; 15.38). He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught practical skills, but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.\n\nIn China, the traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly an initial two or three incipits. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization of the content of a chapter. Chapters in the \"Analects\" are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts or ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.\n\nChapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius's behaviors in various daily activities. Voltaire and Ezra Pound believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. Simon Leys, who recently translated the \"Analects\" into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. Elias Canetti wrote: \"Confucius's \"Analects\" is the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important.\"\n\nWithin these incipits a large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic \"ziyue\", \"The Master said,\" but without punctuation marks in classical Chinese, this does not confirm whether what follows \"ziyue\" is direct quotation of actual sayings of Confucius, or simply to be understood as \"the Master said that..\" and the paraphrase of Confucius by the compilers of the Analects.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "171171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171171", "title": "Ancient Greek philosophy", "text": "Ancient Greek philosophy\n\nAncient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC and continued throughout the Hellenistic period and the period in which Ancient Greece was part of the Roman Empire. Philosophy was used to make sense out of the world in a non-religious way. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric and aesthetics.\n\nMany philosophers around the world agree that Greek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato\". Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Early Islamic philosophy, the European Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nSome claim that Greek philosophy was in turn influenced by the older wisdom literature and mythological cosmogonies of the ancient Near East, though this is debated. Martin Litchfield West gives qualified assent to this view by stating that \"contact with oriental cosmology and theology helped to liberate the early Greek philosophers' imagination; it certainly gave them many suggestive ideas. But they taught themselves to reason. Philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation\".\n\nSubsequent philosophic tradition was so influenced by Socrates as presented by Plato that it is conventional to refer to philosophy developed prior to Socrates as pre-Socratic philosophy. The periods following this, up to and after the wars of Alexander the Great, are those of \"classical Greek\" and \"Hellenistic\" philosophy.\n\nThe convention of terming those philosophers who were active prior to Socrates the \"pre-Socratics\" gained currency with the 1903 publication of Hermann Diels' \"Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\", although the term did not originate with him. The term is considered philosophically useful because what came to be known as the \"Athenian school\" (composed of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle) signaled a profound shift in the subject matter and methods of philosophy; Friedrich Nietzsche's thesis that this shift began with Plato rather than with Socrates (hence his nomenclature of \"pre-Platonic philosophy\") has not prevented the predominance of the \"pre-Socratic\" distinction.\n\nThe pre-Socratics were primarily concerned with cosmology, ontology and mathematics. They were distinguished from \"non-philosophers\" insofar as they rejected mythological explanations in favor of reasoned discourse.\n\nThales of Miletus, regarded by Aristotle as the first philosopher, held that all things arise from a single material substance, water. It is not because he gave a cosmogony that John Burnet calls him the \"first man of science,\" but because he gave a naturalistic explanation of the cosmos and supported it with reasons. According to tradition, Thales was able to predict an eclipse and taught the Egyptians how to measure the height of the pyramids.\n\nThales inspired the Milesian school of philosophy and was followed by Anaximander, who argued that the substratum or \"arche\" could not be water or any of the classical elements but was instead something \"unlimited\" or \"indefinite\" (in Greek, the \"apeiron\"). He began from the observation that the world seems to consist of opposites (e.g., hot and cold), yet a thing can become its opposite (e.g., a hot thing cold). Therefore, they cannot truly be opposites but rather must both be manifestations of some underlying unity that is neither. This underlying unity (substratum, \"arche\") could not be any of the classical elements, since they were one extreme or another. For example, water is wet, the opposite of dry, while fire is dry, the opposite of wet. This initial state is ageless and imperishable, and everything returns to it according to necessity Anaximenes in turn held that the \"arche\" was air, although John Burnet argues that by this he meant that it was a transparent mist, the \"aether\". Despite their varied answers, the Milesian school was searching for a natural substance that would remain unchanged despite appearing in different forms, and thus represents one of the first scientific attempts to answer the question that would lead to the development of modern atomic theory; \"the Milesians,\" says Burnet, \"asked for the \"φύσις\" of all things.\"\n\nXenophanes was born in Ionia, where the Milesian school was at its most powerful, and may have picked up some of the Milesians' cosmological theories as a result. What is known is that he argued that each of the phenomena had a natural rather than divine explanation in a manner reminiscent of Anaximander's theories and that there was only one god, the world as a whole, and that he ridiculed the anthropomorphism of the Greek religion by claiming that cattle would claim that the gods looked like cattle, horses like horses, and lions like lions, just as the Ethiopians claimed that the gods were snubnosed and black and the Thracians claimed they were pale and red-haired.\n\nBurnet says that Xenophanes was not, however, a scientific man, with many of his \"naturalistic\" explanations having no further support than that they render the Homeric gods superfluous or foolish. He has been claimed as an influence on Eleatic philosophy, although that is disputed, and a precursor to Epicurus, a representative of a total break between science and religion.\n\nPythagoras lived at roughly the same time that Xenophanes did and, in contrast to the latter, the school that he founded sought to reconcile religious belief and reason. Little is known about his life with any reliability, however, and no writings of his survive, so it is possible that he was simply a mystic whose successors introduced rationalism into Pythagoreanism, that he was simply a rationalist whose successors are responsible for the mysticism in Pythagoreanism, or that he was actually the author of the doctrine; there is no way to know for certain.\n\nPythagoras is said to have been a disciple of Anaximander and to have imbibed the cosmological concerns of the Ionians, including the idea that the cosmos is constructed of spheres, the importance of the infinite, and that air or aether is the \"arche\" of everything. Pythagoreanism also incorporated ascetic ideals, emphasizing purgation, metempsychosis, and consequently a respect for all animal life; much was made of the correspondence between mathematics and the cosmos in a musical harmony. Pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics, and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.\n\nHeraclitus must have lived after Xenophanes and Pythagoras, as he condemns them along with Homer as proving that much learning cannot teach a man to think; since Parmenides refers to him in the past tense, this would place him in the 5th century BCE. Contrary to the Milesian school, which posits one stable element as the \"arche\", Heraclitus taught that \"panta rhei\" (\"everything flows\"), the closest element to this eternal flux being fire. All things come to pass in accordance with \"Logos\", which must be considered as \"plan\" or \"formula\", and \"the \"Logos\" is common\". He also posited a unity of opposites, expressed through dialectic, which structured this flux, such as that seeming opposites in fact are manifestations of a common substrate to good and evil itself.\n\nHeraclitus called the oppositional processes ἔρις (\"eris\"), \"strife\", and hypothesized that the apparently stable state of δίκη (\"dikê\"), or \"justice\", is the harmonic unity of these opposites.\n\nParmenides of Elea cast his philosophy against those who held \"it is and is not the same, and all things travel in opposite directions,\"—presumably referring to Heraclitus and those who followed him. Whereas the doctrines of the Milesian school, in suggesting that the substratum could appear in a variety of different guises, implied that everything that exists is corpuscular, Parmenides argued that the first principle of being was One, indivisible, and unchanging. Being, he argued, by definition implies eternality, while only that which \"is\" can be thought; a thing which \"is\", moreover, cannot be more or less, and so the rarefaction and condensation of the Milesians is impossible regarding Being; lastly, as movement requires that something exist apart from the thing moving (viz. the space into which it moves), the One or Being cannot move, since this would require that \"space\" both exist and not exist. While this doctrine is at odds with ordinary sensory experience, where things do indeed change and move, the Eleatic school followed Parmenides in denying that sense phenomena revealed the world as it actually was; instead, the only thing with Being was thought, or the question of whether something exists or not is one of whether it can be thought.\n\nIn support of this, Parmenides' pupil Zeno of Elea attempted to prove that the concept of motion was absurd and as such motion did not exist. He also attacked the subsequent development of pluralism, arguing that it was incompatible with Being. His arguments are known as Zeno's paradoxes.\n\nThe power of Parmenides' logic was such that some subsequent philosophers abandoned the monism of the Milesians, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, where one thing was the \"arche\", and adopted pluralism, such as Empedocles and Anaxagoras. There were, they said, multiple elements which were not reducible to one another and these were set in motion by love and strife (as in Empedocles) or by Mind (as in Anaxagoras). Agreeing with Parmenides that there is no coming into being or passing away, genesis or decay, they said that things appear to come into being and pass away because the elements out of which they are composed assemble or disassemble while themselves being unchanging.\n\nLeucippus also proposed an ontological pluralism with a cosmogony based on two main elements: the vacuum and atoms. These, by means of their inherent movement, are crossing the void and creating the real material bodies. His theories were not well known by the time of Plato, however, and they were ultimately incorporated into the work of his student, Democritus.\n\nSophistry arose from the juxtaposition of \"physis\" (nature) and \"nomos\" (law). John Burnet posits its origin in the scientific progress of the previous centuries which suggested that Being was radically different from what was experienced by the senses and, if comprehensible at all, was not comprehensible in terms of order; the world in which men lived, on the other hand, was one of law and order, albeit of humankind's own making. At the same time, nature was constant, while what was by law differed from one place to another and could be changed.\n\nThe first man to call himself a sophist, according to Plato, was Protagoras, whom he presents as teaching that all virtue is conventional. It was Protagoras who claimed that \"man is the measure of all things, of the things that are, that they are, and of the things that are not, that they are not,\" which Plato interprets as a radical perspectivism, where some things seem to be one way for one person (and so actually are that way) and another way for another person (and so actually are \"that\" way as well); the conclusion being that one cannot look to nature for guidance regarding how to live one's life.\n\nProtagoras and subsequent sophists tended to teach rhetoric as their primary vocation. Prodicus, Gorgias, Hippias, and Thrasymachus appear in various dialogues, sometimes explicitly teaching that while nature provides no ethical guidance, the guidance that the laws provide is worthless, or that nature favors those who act against the laws.\n\nSocrates, born in Athens in the 5th century BCE, marks a watershed in ancient Greek philosophy. Athens was a center of learning, with sophists and philosophers traveling from across Greece to teach rhetoric, astronomy, cosmology, geometry, and the like. The great statesman Pericles was closely associated with this new learning and a friend of Anaxagoras, however, and his political opponents struck at him by taking advantage of a conservative reaction against the philosophers; it became a crime to investigate the things above the heavens or below the earth, subjects considered impious. Anaxagoras is said to have been charged and to have fled into exile when Socrates was about twenty years of age. There is a story that Protagoras, too, was forced to flee and that the Athenians burned his books. Socrates, however, is the only subject recorded as charged under this law, convicted, and sentenced to death in 399 BCE (see Trial of Socrates). In the version of his defense speech presented by Plato, he claims that it is the envy he arouses on account of his being a philosopher that will convict him.\n\nWhile philosophy was an established pursuit prior to Socrates, Cicero credits him as \"the first who brought philosophy down from the heavens, placed it in cities, introduced it into families, and obliged it to examine into life and morals, and good and evil.\" By this account he would be considered the founder of political philosophy. The reasons for this turn toward political and ethical subjects remain the object of much study.\n\nThe fact that many conversations involving Socrates (as recounted by Plato and Xenophon) end without having reached a firm conclusion, or aporetically, has stimulated debate over the meaning of the Socratic method. Socrates is said to have pursued this probing question-and-answer style of examination on a number of topics, usually attempting to arrive at a defensible and attractive definition of a virtue.\n\nWhile Socrates' recorded conversations rarely provide a definite answer to the question under examination, several maxims or paradoxes for which he has become known recur. Socrates taught that no one desires what is bad, and so if anyone does something that truly is bad, it must be unwillingly or out of ignorance; consequently, all virtue is knowledge. He frequently remarks on his own ignorance (claiming that he does not know what courage is, for example). Plato presents him as distinguishing himself from the common run of mankind by the fact that, while they know nothing noble and good, they do not \"know\" that they do not know, whereas Socrates knows and acknowledges that he knows nothing noble and good.\n\nNumerous subsequent philosophical movements were inspired by Socrates or his younger associates. Plato casts Socrates as the main interlocutor in his dialogues, deriving from them the basis of Platonism (and by extension, Neoplatonism). Plato's student Aristotle in turn criticized and built upon the doctrines he ascribed to Socrates and Plato, forming the foundation of Aristotelianism. Antisthenes founded the school that would come to be known as Cynicism and accused Plato of distorting Socrates' teachings. Zeno of Citium in turn adapted the ethics of Cynicism to articulate Stoicism. Epicurus studied with Platonic and Stoic teachers before renouncing all previous philosophers (including Democritus, on whose atomism the Epicurean philosophy relies). The philosophic movements that were to dominate the intellectual life of the Roman empire were thus born in this febrile period following Socrates' activity, and either directly or indirectly influenced by him. They were also absorbed by the expanding Muslim world in the 7th through 10th centuries AD, from which they returned to the West as foundations of Medieval philosophy and the Renaissance, as discussed below.\n\nPlato was an Athenian of the generation after Socrates. Ancient tradition ascribes thirty-six dialogues and thirteen letters to him, although of these only twenty-four of the dialogues are now universally recognized as authentic; most modern scholars believe that at least twenty-eight dialogues and two of the letters were in fact written by Plato, although all of the thirty-six dialogues have some defenders. A further nine dialogues are ascribed to Plato but were considered spurious even in antiquity.\n\nPlato's dialogues feature Socrates, although not always as the leader of the conversation. (One dialogue, the \"Laws\", instead contains an \"Athenian Stranger.\") Along with Xenophon, Plato is the primary source of information about Socrates' life and beliefs and it is not always easy to distinguish between the two. While the Socrates presented in the dialogues is often taken to be Plato's mouthpiece, Socrates' reputation for irony, his caginess regarding his own opinions in the dialogues, and his occasional absence from or minor role in the conversation serve to conceal Plato's doctrines. Much of what is said about his doctrines is derived from what Aristotle reports about them.\n\nThe political doctrine ascribed to Plato is derived from the \"Republic\", the \"Laws\", and the \"Statesman\". The first of these contains the suggestion that there will not be justice in cities unless they are ruled by philosopher kings; those responsible for enforcing the laws are compelled to hold their women, children, and property in common; and the individual is taught to pursue the common good through noble lies; the \"Republic\" says that such a city is likely impossible, however, generally assuming that philosophers would refuse to rule and the people would refuse to compel them to do so.\n\nWhereas the \"Republic\" is premised on a distinction between the sort of knowledge possessed by the philosopher and that possessed by the king or political man, Socrates explores only the character of the philosopher; in the \"Statesman\", on the other hand, a participant referred to as the Eleatic Stranger discusses the sort of knowledge possessed by the political man, while Socrates listens quietly. Although rule by a wise man would be preferable to rule by law, the wise cannot help but be judged by the unwise, and so in practice, rule by law is deemed necessary.\n\nBoth the \"Republic\" and the \"Statesman\" reveal the limitations of politics, raising the question of what political order would be best given those constraints; that question is addressed in the \"Laws\", a dialogue that does not take place in Athens and from which Socrates is absent. The character of the society described there is eminently conservative, a corrected or liberalized timocracy on the Spartan or Cretan model or that of pre-democratic Athens.\n\nPlato's dialogues also have metaphysical themes, the most famous of which is his theory of forms. It holds that non-material abstract (but substantial) forms (or ideas), and not the material world of change known to us through our physical senses, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality.\n\nPlato often uses long-form analogies (usually allegories) to explain his ideas; the most famous is perhaps the Allegory of the Cave. It likens most humans to people tied up in a cave, who look only at shadows on the walls and have no other conception of reality. If they turned around, they would see what is casting the shadows (and thereby gain a further dimension to their reality). If some left the cave, they would see the outside world illuminated by the sun (representing the ultimate form of goodness and truth). If these travelers then re-entered the cave, the people inside (who are still only familiar with the shadows) would not be equipped to believe reports of this 'outside world'. This story explains the theory of forms with their different levels of reality, and advances the view that philosopher-kings are wisest while most humans are ignorant. One student of Plato (who would become another of the most influential philosophers of all time) stressed the implication that understanding relies upon first-hand observation.\n\nAristotle moved to Athens from his native Stageira in 367 BC and began to study philosophy (perhaps even rhetoric, under Isocrates), eventually enrolling at Plato's Academy. He left Athens approximately twenty years later to study botany and zoology, became a tutor of Alexander the Great, and ultimately returned to Athens a decade later to establish his own school: the Lyceum. At least twenty-nine of his treatises have survived, known as the \"corpus Aristotelicum\", and address a variety of subjects including logic, physics, optics, metaphysics, ethics, rhetoric, politics, poetry, botany, and zoology.\n\nAristotle is often portrayed as disagreeing with his teacher Plato (e.g., in Raphael's School of Athens). He criticizes the regimes described in Plato's \"Republic\" and \"Laws\", and refers to the theory of forms as \"empty words and poetic metaphors.\" He is generally presented as giving greater weight to empirical observation and practical concerns.\n\nAristotle's fame was not great during the Hellenistic period, when Stoic logic was in vogue, but later peripatetic commentators popularized his work, which eventually contributed heavily to Islamic, Jewish, and medieval Christian philosophy. His influence was such that Avicenna referred to him simply as \"the Master\"; Maimonides, Alfarabi, Averroes, and Aquinas as \"the Philosopher.\"\n\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, many different schools of thought developed in the Hellenistic world and then the Greco-Roman world. There were Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Syrians and Arabs who contributed to the development of Hellenistic philosophy. Elements of Persian philosophy and Indian philosophy also had an influence. The most notable schools of Hellenistic philosophy were:\n\n\nThe spread of Christianity throughout the Roman world, followed by the spread of Islam, ushered in the end of Hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of Medieval philosophy, which was dominated by the three Abrahamic traditions: Jewish philosophy, Christian philosophy, and early Islamic philosophy.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Greek ideas were largely forgotten in Western Europe due to the Migration Period, which resulted into decline in literacy. In the Byzantine Empire Greek ideas were preserved and studied, and not long after the first major expansion of Islam, however, the Abbasid caliphs authorized the gathering of Greek manuscripts and hired translators to increase their prestige. Islamic philosophers such as Al-Kindi (Alkindus), Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) reinterpreted these works, and during the High Middle Ages Greek philosophy re-entered the West through translations from Arabic to Latin and also from the Byzantine Empire. The re-introduction of these philosophies, accompanied by the new Arabic commentaries, had a great influence on Medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas. Although we are fortunate to have some figures who preserved these valuable texts, the general trend in Islam was to dispose of books that conflicted with the teachings of Mohammad. This can be seen in events such as the burning of the Al-hakam II library in Córdoba by Al-Mansur Ibn and Abi Aamir in 976.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3143", "title": "Axiology", "text": "Axiology\n\nAxiology (from Greek , \"axia\", \"value, worth\"; and , \"-logia\") is the philosophical study of value. It is either the collective term for ethics and aesthetics, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to value theory and meta-ethics. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902, and Eduard von Hartmann, in 1908.\n\nAxiology studies mainly two kinds of values: ethics and aesthetics. Ethics investigates the concepts of \"right\" and \"good\" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of \"beauty\" and \"harmony.\" Formal axiology, the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with mathematical rigor, is exemplified by Robert S. Hartman's science of value.\n\nBetween the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. Socrates believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. Socrates' student, Plato furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, Thomas Aquinas made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "406752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406752", "title": "Buddhist symbolism", "text": "Buddhist symbolism\n\nBuddhist symbolism is the method of Buddhist art to represent certain aspects of dharma, which began in the fourth century BCE. Anthropomorphic symbolism appeared from around the first century CE with the arts of Mathura the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and were combined with the previous symbols. Various symbolic innovations were later introduced, especially through [Tibetan Buddhism]\n\nIt is not known what the role of the image was in Early Buddhism, although many surviving images can be found, because their symbolic or representative nature was not clearly explained in early texts. Among the earliest and most common symbols of Buddhism are the stupa (and the relics therein), the Dharmachakra or Dharma wheel, the Bodhi Tree (and the distinctively shaped leaves of this tree) and the lotus flower. The dharma wheel, traditionally represented with eight spokes, can have a variety of meanings. It initially only meant royalty (Chakravartin, \"Turner of the Wheel\"), but it began to be used in a Buddhist context on the Pillars of Ashoka during the 3rd century BC. The Dharma wheel is generally seen as referring to the historical process of teaching Buddhism, the eight spokes referring to the Noble Eightfold Path. The lotus, as well, can have several meanings, often referring to the quality of compassion and subsequently to the related notion of the inherently pure potential of the mind. The Bodhi Tree represents the spot where the Buddha reached nirvana and thus represents liberation.\n\nOther early symbols include the monks begging bowl and the trishula, a symbol used since around the second century BCE, and combining the lotus, the vajra (diamond) and a symbolization of the triratna or \"three jewels\": Buddha, dharma, and sangha. The lion, riderless horse and also deer were also used in early Buddhist iconography. The Buddha's teachings are referred to as the \"Lion's Roar\" in the sutras, indicative of their power and nobility. The riderless horse represents renunciation and the deer represent Buddhist disciples, as the Buddha gave his first sermon at the deer park of Varanasi.\n\nThe swastika was traditionally used in India by Buddhists and Hindus to represent good fortune. In East Asia, the swastika is often used as a general symbol of Buddhism. Swastikas used in this context can either be left or right-facing.\n\nEarly Buddhism did not portray the Buddha himself instead using an empty throne and the Bodhi Tree to represent the Buddha and thus may have leaned towards aniconism. The first hint of a human representation in Buddhist symbolism appear with the Buddha footprint and full representations were influenced by Greco-Buddhist art.\n\nIn Theravada, Buddhist art stayed strictly in the realm of representational and historic meaning. Reminders of the Buddha, \"cetiya\", were divided up into relic, spatial, and representational memorials.\n\nAlthough the Buddha was not represented in human form until around the first century, the physical characteristics of the Buddha are described in one of the central texts of the traditional Pāli Canon, the \"Dīgha Nikāya\", in the discourse titled \"Sutra of the Marks\" (Pali: \"Lakkhaṇa Sutta\", D.iii.142ff.).\n\nThese characteristics comprise 32 signs, \"The 32 signs of a Great Man\" (Pali: \"Lakkhaṇa Mahāpurisa 32\"), and were supplemented by another eighty secondary characteristics (Pali: \"anubyañjana\").\n\nIn the Mahayana schools, Buddhist figures and sacred objects leaned towards esoteric and symbolic meaning. Mudras are a series of symbolic hand gestures describing the actions of the characters represented in only the most interesting Buddhist art. Many images also function as mandalas.\n\nMahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist art frequently makes use of a particular set of \"eight auspicious symbols\" (Sanskrit \"aṣṭamaṅgala\", ), in domestic and public art. These symbols have spread with Buddhism to the art of many cultures, including Indian, Tibetan, Nepalese, and Chinese art.\n\nThese symbols are:\n\n\nIn East Asian Buddhism, the swastika is a widely used symbol of eternity. It is used to mark Buddhist temples on maps and in the beginning of Buddhist texts. It is known in Classical Tibetan as \"yungdrung\" () in ancient Tibet, it was a graphical representation of eternity.\n\nIn Zen, a widely used symbol is the ensō, a hand-drawn circle.\n\nA central Vajrayana symbol is the vajra, a sacred indestructible weapon of the god Indra, associated with lightning and the hardness of diamonds. It symbolizes emptiness (śūnyatā) and therefore indestructible nature of reality.\n\nOther Vajrayana symbols include the ghanta (ritual bell), the bhavacakra, mandalas, the number 108 and the Buddha eyes commonly seen on Nepalese stupas such as at Boudhanath. There are various mythical creatures used in Vajrayana as well: Snow Lion, Wind Horse, dragon, garuda and tiger.\n\nThe popular mantra \"om mani padme hum\" is widely used to symbolize compassion and is commonly seen inscribed on rocks, prayer wheels, stupas and art.\n\nTibetan Buddhist architecture is centered on the stupa, called in Tibetan . The chörten consists of five parts that represent the Mahābhūta (five elements). The base is square which represents the earth element, above that sits a dome representing water, on that is a cone representing fire, on the tip of the cone is a crescent representing air, inside the crescent is a flame representing ether. The tapering of the flame to a point can also be said to represent consciousness as a sixth element. The chörten presents these elements of the body in the order of the process of dissolution at death.\n\nTibetan temples are often three-storied. The three can represent many aspects such as the Trikaya (three aspects) of a buddha. The ground story may have a statue of the historical buddha Gautama and depictions of Earth and so represent the nirmāṇakāya. The first story may have Buddha and elaborate ornamentation representing rising above the human condition and the sambhogakāya. The second story may have a primordial Adi-Buddha in Yab-Yum (sexual union with his female counterpart) and be otherwise unadorned representing a return to the absolute reality and the dharmakāya \"truth body\".\n\nTable sources\n\nThe five colours (Sanskrit \"pañcavarṇa\" - white, green, yellow, blue, red) are supplemented by several other colours including black and orange and gold (which is commonly associated with yellow). They are commonly used for prayer flags as well as for visualising deities and spiritual energy, construction of mandalas and the painting of religions icons.\n\nTibetan Buddhist deities may often assume different roles and be drawn, sculpted and visualised differently according to these roles, for example, Green Tara and White Tara which are but two of many different aspects of Tara.\n\nAside from these vivid colours, figures may also be coloured more naturalistically such as skin in shades of pink or brown. Gold colored leaf and gold paint are also common. These colours help distinguish many deities that are less easily distinguished in other branches of Buddhism. For instance while Shakyamuni Buddha may be seen in (pale) yellow or orange and Amitabha Buddha is typically red in Vajrayana thangkas, in Chinese Buddhism it is often only the hand pose that distinguishes the two who are otherwise drawn with the same attributes.\n\nDepictions of \"wrathful deities\" are often depicted very fearsomely, crushing their foes, with monstrous visages and wearing \"memento mori\" in the form of skulls or bodily parts. Such deities are depicted in this way as sometimes great wrath is required to overcome great ignorance and adharma.\n\nAs is common in Buddhism, the lotus is used in Vajrayana. A lotus may appear fully blossomed, starting to open or still a bud to represent the teachings that have gone, are current or are yet to come.\n\nAvalokiteśvara is often depicted with one thousand (or, at least, many) arms to represent the many methods he uses to help all sentient beings and often has eleven heads to symbolise his compassion is directed to all sentient beings.\n\nVajrayana Buddhism often specifies the number of feet of a buddha or bodhisattva. While two is common there may also be ten, sixteen, or twenty-four feet. The position of the feet/legs may also have a specific meaning such as in Green Tara who is typically depicted as seated partly cross-legged but with one leg down symbolising \"immersion within in the absolute, in meditation\" and readiness to step forth and help sentient beings by \"engagement without in the world through compassion\".\n\n= Symbolic Physical Attributes of Buddhism =\n\nBuddhism has other symbolism that are physical and needed for ritual such as their robes. The robes for example in the sect of Theravada are noticeably different than the robes of the other sects of Buddhism. Since Theravada is the orthodox or the oldest of the three sects, they have a different traditional layout of their Theravada robes. They carry their robes over their shoulders, most often showing their arm and the color their sect represents. Theravada, for example is Saffron, while other sects of Buddhism (and in different countries) will have it as a different color as well as different styles or ways on how they wear it. Once Buddhism spread throughout China back in sixth century BCE, it was seen wrong to show that much skin, and that's when robes to cover both arms with long sleeves came in to play. Other parts of China such as Tibet, have changed over time and they show both their shoulders as well as having a two piece attire rather than one. Shortly thereafter, Japan integrated a bib along with their long sleeve robe called a \"koromo\". This was a clothing piece made specifically for their school of Zen which they practice in T\"akahatsu\" that involves the monks of Japan wearing a straw hat.\n\nIn all sects of Buddhism, there is a ringing of a bell where a Buddhist monk rings the large bronze bell signifying the start of the evening rituals. There are different names of each and every bell but some examples include The Tzar Bell and The Bell of Good Luck. They use the bell to detain away the bad spirits and have the Buddha protect them at the time of their ritual. Some sects call this a part of the \"Mystic Law\" which is the beginning of a Buddhist ritual.\n\nShaving ones head is another act of ritual for which you need to complete before being a part of Monastic Buddhism to ultimately reach nirvana. To shave ones head merely signifies ones readiness into this sect of Buddhism. Another mention of the symbolism of one shaving their hair is simply that it is one of the rules the Buddha gave to his disciples to be kept away from ordinary life and be fully involved.\n\nAnother form of symbolism of the Buddhist is the joining of your hands together at prayer or at the time of the ritual. Buddhist compare their fingers with the petals of the lotus flower. Bowing down is another form of symbolic position in the act of the ritual, when Buddhist bow in front of the Buddha or to another person they aren't bowing at the physical (the human or the statue) but they are bowing at the Buddha inside of them (the human) or it (the statue).\n\nAt its founding in 1952, the World Fellowship of Buddhists adopted two symbols. These were a traditional eight-spoked Dharma wheel and the five-colored flag which had been designed in Sri Lanka in the 1880s with the assistance of Henry Steel Olcott.\n\nThe six vertical bands of the flag represent the six colors of the aura which Buddhists believe emanated from the body of the Buddha when he attained Enlightenment:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40726052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40726052", "title": "Community genetics", "text": "Community genetics\n\nCommunity genetics is a recently emerged field in biology that fuses elements of community ecology, evolutionary biology, and molecular and quantitative genetics. Antonovics first articulated the vision for such a field, and Whitham et al. formalized its definition as “The study of the genetic interactions that occur between species and their abiotic environment in complex communities.” The field aims to bridge the gaps in the study of evolution and ecology, within the multivariate community context that ecological and evolutionary phenomena are embedded within. The documentary movie \"A Thousand Invisible Cords\" provides an introduction to the field and its implications.\nTo date, the primary focus of most community genetics studies has been on the influences of genetic variation in plants on foliar arthropod communities. In a wide variety of ecosystems, different plant genotypes often support different compositions of associated foliar arthropod communities. Such community phenotypes have been observed in natural hybrid complexes, among genotypes and sibling families within a single species and among different plant populations. To understand the broader impacts of differences among plant genotypes on biodiversity as a whole, researchers have begun to examine the response of other organisms, such as foliar endophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, soil microbes, litter dwelling arthropods, herbaceous plants and epiphytes. These effects are frequently examined with foundation species in temperate ecosystems, who structure ecosystems by modulating and stabilizing resources and ecosystem processes. The emphasis on foundation species allows researchers to focus on the likely most important players in a system without becoming overwhelmed by the complexity of all the genetically variable interactions occurring at the same time. However, unique effects of plant genotypes have also been found with non-foundation species, and can occur in tropical, boreal and alpine systems.\n\nThe vision for the field of community genetics extends beyond documentation of different communities on different genotypes of a focal species. Other aspects of this field include understanding how species interactions within a community are modulated by host genotype, implications of host genotype on the fitness and evolution of community members, and selection on hosts influencing associated communities. Future progress in the field of community genetics is strongly dependent on breakthroughs of modern molecular DNA-based technology, such as genome sequencing. The application of a community genetics approach to understanding how species and communities of interacting organisms are reacting to rapid changes in climate, as well as informing restoration, are two important applied aspects of community genetics.\n"}
{"id": "2621799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2621799", "title": "Condensed detachment", "text": "Condensed detachment\n\nCondensed detachment (Rule D) is a method of finding the most general possible conclusion given two formal logical statements.\nIt was developed by the Irish logician Carew Meredith in the 1950s and inspired by the work of Łukasiewicz.\n\nA rule of detachment (often referred to as modus ponens) says:<br>\n\"Given that formula_1 implies formula_2, and given formula_1, infer formula_2.\"\n\nThe condensed detachment goes a step further and says:<br>\n\"Given that formula_1 implies formula_2, and given an formula_7, use a unifier of formula_1 and formula_7 to make formula_1 and formula_7 the same, then use a standard rule of detachment.\"\n\nA substitution \"A\" that when applied to formula_1 produces formula_13, and substitution \"B\" that when applied to formula_7 produces formula_13, are called unifiers of formula_1 and formula_7.\n\nVarious unifiers may produce expressions with varying numbers of free variables. Some possible unifying expressions are substitution instances of others. If one expression is a substitution instance of another (and not just a variable renaming), then that other is called \"more general\".\n\nIf the most general unifier is used in condensed detachment, then the logical result is the most general conclusion that can be made in the given inference with the given second expression. Since any weaker inference you can get is a substitution instance of the most general one, nothing less than the most general unifier is ever used in practice.\n\nSome logics, such as classical propositional calculus, have a set of defining axioms with the \"D-completeness\" property. If a set of axioms is D-Complete, then any valid theorem of the system, including all of its substitution instances (up to variable renaming), can be generated by condensed detachment alone. For example, if formula_18 is a theorem of a D-complete system, condensed detachment can prove not only that theorem but also its substitution instance formula_19 by using a longer proof. Note that \"D-completeness\" is a property of an axiomatic basis for a system, not an intrinsic property of a logic system itself.\n\nJ. A. Kalman proved that any conclusion that can be generated by a sequence of uniform substitution (all instances of a variable are replaced with the same content) and \"modus ponens\" steps can either be generated by condensed detachment alone, or is a substitution instance of something that can be generated by condensed detachment alone.\nThis makes condensed detachment useful for any logic system that has \"modus ponens\" and substitution, regardless of whether or not it is D-complete.\n\nSince a given major premise and a given minor premise uniquely determine the conclusion (up to variable renaming), Meredith observed that it was only necessary to note which two statements were involved and that the condensed detachment can be used without any other notation required. This led to the \"D-notation\" for proofs. This notation uses the \"D\" operator to mean condensed detachment, and takes 2 arguments, in a standard prefix notation string. For example, if you have four axioms a typical proof in D-notation might look like: DD12D34 which shows a condensed detachment step using the result of two prior condensed detachment steps, the first of which used axioms 1 and 2, and the second of which used axioms 3 and 4.\n\nThis notation, besides being used in some automated theorem provers, sometimes appears in catalogs of proofs.\n\nCondensed detachment's use of unification predates the resolution techniques of automated theorem proving.\n\nFor automated theorem proving condensed detachment has a number of advantages over raw \"modus ponens\" and uniform substitution.\n\nAt a Modus Ponens and substitution proof you have an infinite number of choices for what you can substitute for variables. This means that you have an infinite number of possible next steps. With condensed detachment there are only a finite number of possible next steps in a proof.\n\nThe D-notation for complete condensed detachment proofs allows easy description of proofs for cataloging and search. A typical complete 30 step proof is less than 60 characters long in D-notation (excluding the statement of the axioms.)\n\n"}
{"id": "353859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=353859", "title": "Confidentiality", "text": "Confidentiality\n\nConfidentiality involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.\n\nLawyers are often required by law to keep confidential anything pertaining to the representation of a client. The duty of confidentiality is much broader than the attorney–client evidentiary privilege, which only covers \"communications\" between the attorney and the client.\n\nBoth the privilege and the duty serve the purpose of encouraging clients to speak frankly about their cases. This way, lawyers can carry out their duty to provide clients with zealous representation. Otherwise, the opposing side may be able to surprise the lawyer in court with something he did not know about his client, which may weaken the client's position. Also, a distrustful client might hide a relevant fact he thinks is incriminating, but that a skilled lawyer could turn to the client's advantage (for example, by raising affirmative defenses like self-defense)\n\nHowever, most jurisdictions have exceptions for situations where the lawyer has reason to believe that the client may kill or seriously injure someone, may cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of another, or is using (or seeking to use) the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud.\n\nIn such situations the lawyer has the discretion, but not the obligation, to disclose information designed to prevent the planned action. Most states have a version of this discretionary disclosure rule under Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6 (or its equivalent).\n\nA few jurisdictions have made this traditionally discretionary duty mandatory. For example, see the New Jersey and Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6.\n\nIn some jurisdictions the lawyer must try to convince the client to conform his or her conduct to the boundaries of the law before disclosing any otherwise confidential information.\n\nNote that these exceptions generally do not cover crimes that have already occurred, even in extreme cases where murderers have confessed the location of missing bodies to their lawyers but the police are still looking for those bodies. The U.S. Supreme Court and many state supreme courts have affirmed the right of a lawyer to withhold information in such situations. Otherwise, it would be impossible for any criminal defendant to obtain a zealous defense.\n\nCalifornia is famous for having one of the strongest duties of confidentiality in the world; its lawyers must protect client confidences at \"every peril to himself [or herself]\" under former California Business and Professions Code section 6068(e). Until an amendment in 2004 (which turned subsection (e) into subsection (e)(1) and added subsection (e)(2) to section 6068), California lawyers were not even permitted to disclose that a client was about to commit murder or assault. The Supreme Court of California promptly amended the California Rules of Professional Conduct to conform to the new exception in the revised statute.\n\nRecent legislation in the UK curtails the confidentiality professionals like lawyers and accountants can maintain at the expense of the state. Accountants, for example, are required to disclose to the state any suspicions of fraudulent accounting and, even, the legitimate use of tax saving schemes if those schemes are not already known to the tax authorities.\n\nThe \"three traditional requirements of the cause of action for breach of confidence\" were identified by Megarry J in \"Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd\" (1968) in the following terms:\n\nThe 1896 case featuring the royal \"accoucheur\" Dr William Smoult Playfair showed the difference between lay and medical views. Playfair was consulted by Linda Kitson; he ascertained that she had been pregnant while separated from her husband. He informed his wife, a relative of Kitson's, in order that she protect herself and their daughters from moral contagion. Kitson sued, and the case gained public notoriety, with huge damages awarded against the doctor. \n\nConfidentiality is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing certain discussions with patients, even under oath in court. This physician-patient privilege only applies to secrets shared between physician and patient during the course of providing medical care.\n\nThe rule dates back to at least the Hippocratic Oath, which reads: \"Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret.\"\n\nTraditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice.\n\nConfidentiality is standard in the United States by HIPAA laws, specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many American states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.\n\nIn the United Kingdom information about an individual's HIV status is kept confidential within the NHS. This is based in law, in the NHS Constitution and in key NHS rules and procedures. It is also outlined in every NHS employee’s contract of employment and in professional standards set by regulatory bodies. The National AIDS Trust's Confidentiality in the NHS: Your Information, Your Rights outlines these rights. All registered healthcare professionals must abide by these standards and if they are found to have breached confidentiality, they can face disciplinary action.\n\nA healthcare worker shares confidential information with someone else who is, or is about to, provide the patient directly with healthcare to make sure they get the best possible treatment. They only share information that is relevant to their care in that instance, and with consent.\n\nThere are two ways to give consent: \"explicit consent\" or \"implied consent\". Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.\n\nIf a patient doesn't want a healthcare worker to share confidential health information, they need to make this clear and discuss the matter with healthcare staff. Patients have the right, in most situations, to refuse permission for a health care professional to share their information with another healthcare professional, even one giving them care—but are advised, where appropriate, about the dangers of this course of action, due to possible drug interactions.\n\nHowever, in a few limited instances, a healthcare worker can share personal information without consent if it is in the public interest. These instances are set out in guidance from the General Medical Council, which is the regulatory body for doctors. Sometimes the healthcare worker has to provide the information - if required by law or in response to a court order.\n\nThe National AIDS Trust has written a guide for people living with HIV to confidentiality in the NHS.\n\nThe ethical principle of confidentiality requires that information shared by a client with a therapist in the course of treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the therapeutic alliance, as it promotes an environment of trust. There are important exceptions to confidentiality, namely where it conflicts with the clinician's duty to warn or duty to protect. This includes instances of suicidal behavior or homicidal plans, child abuse, elder abuse and dependent adult abuse. Recently, confidentiality laws have been changed so that doctors and nurses face strict penalties if they breach confidentiality.\n\nOn 26 June 2012 a judge of Oslo District Court apologized for the court's hearing of testimony (on 14 June, regarding contact with Child Welfare Services (Norway)) that was covered by confidentiality (that had not been waived at that point of the trial of Anders Behring Breivik).\n\nSome legal jurisdictions recognise a category of commercial confidentiality whereby a business may withhold information on the basis of perceived harm to \"commercial interests\". For example: Soft drink giant Coca-Cola's main syrup formula remains a trade-secret.\n\nConfidentiality agreements that \"seal\" litigation settlements are not uncommon, but this can leave regulators and society ignorant of public hazards. In the U.S. state of Washington, for example, journalists discovered that about two dozen medical malpractice cases had been improperly sealed by judges, leading to improperly weak discipline by the state Department of Health. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Catholic sexual abuse scandal involved a number of confidentiality agreements with victims. Some states have passed laws that limit confidentiality. For example, in 1990 Florida passed a 'Sunshine in Litigation' law that limits confidentiality from concealing public hazards. Washington state, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana have laws limiting confidentiality as well, although judicial interpretation has weakened the application of these types of laws. In the U.S. Congress, a similar federal Sunshine in Litigation Act has been proposed but not passed in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015.\n"}

He was not only a language reformer but also an innovator in the use of Serbian Cyrillic Graphemes. Also, his research and studies of the detailed chemistry, mineralogy, and isotopic compositions of meteorites provide invaluable clues to the range of chemical and physical processing and timing of events in the solar nebula.\n\nJanković was born in 1758 to a Serbian family in Ratzen Stadt (modern Novi Sad), then part of the Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy (now Serbia).\n\nIn 1790 he and Damjan Kaulić both independently petitioned for a Serbian printing house in Novi Sad, but were rejected by the Austrian government.\n\nHe wrote the first modern Serbian treatise on hygiene.\n\nEmanuilo Janković died in 1792 in Subotica. Ruđer Bošković, Dositej Obradović and Atanasije Stojković were his contemporaries. In his lifetime and after death, Emanuilo Janković was more noted as a philosopher and man of letters than a scientist. But as the years progressed, his early research on meteorites became Meteor Science and his reputation as a scientist was also recognized.\n\nHis importance lies in his pioneering work at the period of the Age of Enlightenment in such diverse fields as science, drama and publishing, as well as in the use of the vernacular in literature. Janković was a native of Novi Sad, Banat, and his critics regard him as a rude precursor of Vuk Karadžić, the reformer of Serbian language. He wrote \"Fiziceskkoe Socinenie\" (Treatise on Physics).\n\nHe made significant and wide-ranging contributions to Serbian cultural life, though little recognition has been accorded to him in Serbia. Unfortunately little is known about his personal life. The information we have is fragmentary and to a great extent is provided by the prologues of his works, his one extant letter of 15 September 1790, and German and Latin copies of other of his letters and those of his contemporaries, now preserved in the Budapest State Archives.\n\nVery early on Emanuilo Janković became aware that in eighteenth century Serbian there was no normalized literary language and orthography, and that learned men often wrote in an idiom that was incomprehensible to the common folk and the uneducated. He read Dositej Obradović and corrspondended with him. Janković knew Dositej's efforts to write in a language that was close to the vernacular and understandable to all. By then, the works of Obradović were being brought to the attention of European scholars, and Jernej Kopitar was among the first to embrace the efforts of Dositej Obradović and Emanuilo Janković.\n\nEmanuilo Janković was one of the authors who applied phonemic principles with relative consistency in solutions involving individual phonemes or phoneme sequences.\n\nHe particularly disliked the use of letters, which stood for a sound non-existent in Serbian, and \"space-gobbling\" and totally superfluous letters. He read essays by Dositej Obradović and others on language reforms being done throughout Europe and Imperial Russia. These essays had been severely criticized by members of the hierarchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church because they proposed to simplify the traditional Slavonic alphabet for secular one, by eliminating letters that were duplicates or stood for sounds not in the Serbian language. The clergy had charged that dropping certain letters would cause the modern orthography to come into \"collision\" with the Slavonic. Janković defended them, citing Russian spelling that corresponds to Russian speech and not Slavonic. He suggested that Serbs keep the orthography of the church language separate from that of the living language they would use in the new literature.\n\nIn chronological order:\n\n"}

On March 26, 1997, police discovered the bodies of 39 members of the group, who had participated in a mass suicide in order to reach what they believed was an extraterrestrial spacecraft following Comet Hale–Bopp.\n\nJust before the suicide, the group's website was updated with the message: \"Hale-Bopp brings closure to Heaven's Gate ... Our 22 years of classroom here on planet Earth is finally coming to conclusion 'graduation' from the Human Evolutionary Level. We are happily prepared to leave 'this world' and go with Ti's crew.\"\n\nThe son of a Presbyterian minister and a former soldier, Marshall Applewhite began his foray into biblical prophecy in the early 1970s. After being fired from the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas over an alleged relationship with one of his male students, he met Bonnie Nettles, a 44-year-old married nurse with an interest in theosophy and biblical prophecy, in March 1972. According to Applewhite's writings, the two met in the psychiatric hospital where she worked during his stay there and quickly became close friends. Applewhite later recalled that he felt like he had known Nettles for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment.\n\nApplewhite and Nettles pondered the life of St. Francis of Assisi and read works by authors including Helena Blavatsky, R. D. Laing, and Richard Bach. They kept a King James Bible with them and studied several passages from the New Testament, focusing on teachings about Christology, asceticism, and eschatology. Applewhite also read science fiction, including works by Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke. By June 1974, Applewhite and Nettles's beliefs had solidified into a basic outline. They concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people. They wrote a pamphlet that described Jesus' reincarnation as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite. Furthermore, they concluded that they were the two witnesses described in the Book of Revelation and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities, often referring to themselves as \"The Two\", or \"The UFO Two\". They believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as \"the Demonstration\", was to prove their claims. To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received by existing religious communities.\n\nEventually, Applewhite and Nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials, and they sought like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called \"the crew\". At the events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They stated that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level. In 1975, during a group meeting with eighty people in Joan Culpepper's Studio City home, they shared their \"simultaneous\" revelation that they had been told they were the two witnesses written into the Bible's story of the end time.\n\nLater in 1975, the crew assembled at a hotel in Waldport, Oregon. After selling all \"worldly\" possessions and saying farewell to loved ones, the group vanished from the hotel and from the public eye. That night on the \"CBS Evening News\", Walter Cronkite reported that the group had disappeared, in one of the very first national reports on the developing religious group: \"A score of persons... have disappeared. It's a mystery whether they've been taken on a so-called trip to eternity or simply been taken.\" In reality, Applewhite and Nettles had arranged for the group to go underground. From that point, \"Do and Ti\" (pronounced \"doe and tee\"), as the two now called themselves, led the nearly one-hundred-member crew across the country, sleeping in tents and sleeping bags and begging in the streets. Evading detection by the authorities and media enabled the group to focus on Do and Ti's doctrine of helping members of the crew achieve a \"higher evolutionary level\" above human, to which they claimed to have already reached.\n\nApplewhite and Nettles used a variety of aliases over the years, notably \"Bo and Peep\" and \"Do and Ti\". The group also had a variety of names prior to the adoption of the name Heaven's Gate (and at the time Vallée studied the group), it was known as Human Individual Metamorphosis (HIM). The group re-invented and renamed itself several times and had a variety of recruitment methods. Applewhite believed that he was directly related to Jesus, meaning he was an \"Evolutionary Kingdom Level Above Human\".\n\nIndeed, Applewhite's writings, which combined aspects of Millennialism, Gnosticism, and science fiction, suggest he believed himself to be Jesus' successor and the \"Present Representative\" of Christ on Earth. Do and Ti taught during the religious movement's early beginnings that Do's bodily \"vehicle\" was inhabited by the same alien spirit which belonged to Jesus; likewise, Ti (Nettles) was presented as God the Father.\n\nThe crew used numerous methods of recruitment as they toured the United States in destitution, proclaiming the gospel of higher level metamorphosis, the deceit of humans by false-god spirits, envelopment with sunlight for meditative healing, and the divinity of the \"UFO Two\". Throughout the late 70s and early 80s, as their belief system developed around the cult of personalities, membership grew. Some sociologists agree that the popular movement of alternative religious experience and individualism found in collective spiritual experiences during that period helped contribute to the growth of the new religious movement. \"Sheilaism\", as it became known, was a way for people to merge their diverse religious backgrounds and coalesce around a shared, generalized faith, which followers of new religious sects like Applewhite's crew found a very appetizing alternative to traditional dogmas in Judaism, Catholicism and evangelical Christianity. Many of Applewhite and Nettle's crew hailed from these very diverse backgrounds; most of them are described by researchers as having been \"longtime truth-seekers\", or spiritual hippies who had long since believed in attempting to \"find themselves\" through spiritual means, combining faiths in a sort of cultural milieu well into the mid-80s. \nHowever, remarkably, many of those same researchers note that not all of Applewhite's crew were hippies recruited from far-left alternative religious backgrounds in fact, one such recruit early on was John Craig, a respected Republican running for the Colorado House of Representatives at the time of joining in 1975. As recruit numbers grew in its pre-internet days, the clan of \"UFO followers\" all seemed to have in common a need for communal belonging in an alternative path to higher existence without the constraints of institutionalized faith.\n\nHowever, it was not until the death of Nettles in 1985 and Applewhite's subsequent revision of the group's doctrines that the crew gained an eventual reputation as a \"cyberculture\" form of religious thought reform; by the mid-90s, the group had become reclusive, calling themselves by the mysterious business name \"Higher Source\", and began recruiting via uploaded internet content. Rumors began spreading throughout the group in the following years that the upcoming Comet Hale–Bopp housed the secret to their ultimate salvation and ascendance into the kingdom of heaven. These rumors continued through various video uploads onto the web page, which gained a mass following.\n\nIn 1996, members of Do's clan took their Internet recruitment and technical savviness to new levels in a large home they called \"The Monastery\", a 9,000-square-foot residence in Rancho Santa Fe, near San Diego, California. The home would eventually be a gathering place for the group's final siren call and the \"Closure to Heaven's Gate\" that the return of Hale-Bopp comet signified, as the group's web page used to read.\n\nKnown to the mainstream media (though largely ignored through the 1980s and 1990s), Heaven's Gate was better known in UFO circles as well as in a series of academic studies by sociologist Robert Balch. \"Coast to Coast AM\" host Art Bell featured Heaven's Gate and the \"companion object\" in the shadow of Hale-Bopp on several programs.\n\nHeaven's Gate received coverage in Jacques Vallée's book \"Messengers of Deception\" (1979), in which Vallée described an unusual public meeting organized by the group. Vallée frequently expressed concerns within the book about contactee groups' authoritarian political and religious outlooks, and Heaven's Gate did not escape criticism.\n\nIn January 1994, the \"LA Weekly\" ran an article on the group, then known as \"The Total Overcomers\". Through this article, Rio DiAngelo discovered the group and eventually joined them.\n\nLouis Theroux contacted the Heaven's Gate group while making a program for his BBC Two documentary series, \"Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends\", in early March 1997. In response to his e-mail, Theroux was told that Heaven's Gate could not take part in the documentary as \"at the present time a project like this would be an interference with what we must focus on.\"\n\nOn March 19–20, 1997, Marshall Applewhite taped himself speaking of mass suicide and asserted \"it was the only way to evacuate this Earth\". After claiming that a spacecraft was trailing Comet Hale–Bopp, Applewhite persuaded 38 followers to commit suicide so that their souls could board the supposed craft. Applewhite believed that after their deaths, an unidentified flying object (UFO) would take their souls to another \"level of existence above human\", which he described as being both physical and spiritual. This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of UFO religion. In October 1996, the group purchased alien abduction insurance that would cover up to 50 members and would pay out $1 million per person (the policy covered abduction, impregnation, or death by aliens).\n\nThe group rented a 9,200-square-foot (850 m) mansion, located near 18341 Colina Norte (later changed to Paseo Victoria) in a gated community of upscale homes in the San Diego-area community of Rancho Santa Fe, from Sam Koutchesfahani, paying $7,000 per month in cash. Thirty-eight Heaven's Gate members, plus group leader Applewhite, were found dead in the home on March 26, 1997. In the heat of the California spring, many of the bodies had begun to decompose by the time they were discovered. The bodies were later cremated.\n\nMembers took phenobarbital mixed with apple sauce and washed it all down with vodka. Additionally, they secured plastic bags around their heads after ingesting the mix to induce asphyxiation. Authorities found the dead lying neatly in their own bunk beds, faces and torsos covered by a square purple cloth. Each member carried a five-dollar bill and three quarters in their pockets: the five dollar bill was to cover vagrancy fines while members were out on jobs, while the quarters were to make phone calls. All 39 were dressed in identical black shirts and sweat pants, brand new black-and-white Nike Decades athletic shoes, and armband patches reading \"Heaven's Gate Away Team\" (one of many instances of the group's use of the \"Star Trek\" fictional universe's nomenclature).\n\nThe adherents, between the ages of 26 and 72, are believed to have died in three groups over three successive days, with remaining participants cleaning up after each prior group's deaths. Fifteen members died on March 24, fifteen more on March 25, and nine on March 26. Leader Applewhite was the third to last member to die; two people remained after him and were the only ones found without bags over their heads. Among the dead was Thomas Nichols, brother of the actress Nichelle Nichols, who is best known for her role as Uhura in the original \"\" television series.\n\nThe Heaven's Gate event was widely publicized in the media as an example of mass suicide. When news broke of the suicides and their relation to Comet Hale–Bopp, the co-discoverer of the comet, Alan Hale, was drawn into the story. Hale's phone \"never stopped ringing the entire day.\" He did not respond until the next day, when he spoke at a press conference on the subject only after researching details of the incident. Speaking at the Second World Skeptics Congress in Heidelberg, Germany on July 24, 1998:\nHale said that well before Heaven's Gate, he had told a colleague:\nTwo former members of Heaven's Gate, Wayne Cooke and Charlie Humphreys, later committed suicide in a similar manner. Humphreys survived a suicide pact with Cooke in May 1997, but ultimately killed himself in February 1998. The original 39 deaths also motivated the April 1997 suicide of a 58-year-old California man, who left a note saying he hoped to join the dead Heaven's Gate members.\n\nTwo surviving members still maintain the group's website, although it has not been altered since the suicide. The two do not identify themselves in interviews.\n\nHeaven's Gate members believed the planet Earth was about to be \"recycled\" (\"wiped clean, renewed, refurbished, and rejuvenated\"), and the only chance to survive was to leave it immediately. While the group was against suicide, they defined \"suicide\" in their own context to mean \"to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered\" and believed their \"human\" bodies were only vessels meant to help them on their journey. In conversation, when referring to a person or a person's body, they routinely used the word \"vehicle\".\n\nThe members of the group added -ody to the first names they adopted in lieu of their original given names, which defines \"children of the Next Level\". This is mentioned in Applewhite's final video, \"Do's Final Exit\", filmed March 19–20, 1997, just days prior to the suicides.\n\nThey believed \"to be eligible for membership in the Next Level, humans would have to shed every attachment to the planet\". This meant all members had to give up all human-like characteristics, such as their family, friends, sexuality, individuality, jobs, money, and possessions.\n\n\"The Evolutionary Level Above Human\" (TELAH) was as a \"physical, corporeal place\", another world in our universe, where residents live in pure bliss and nourish themselves by absorbing pure sunlight. At the next level, beings do not engage in sexual intercourse, eating or dying, the things that make us \"mammalian\" here. Heaven's Gate believed that what the Bible calls God is actually a highly developed Extraterrestrial.\n\nMembers of Heaven's Gate believed that evil space aliens called Luciferians falsely represented themselves to Earthlings as \"God\" and conspired to keep humans from developing. Technically advanced humanoids, these aliens have spacecraft, space-time travel, telepathy, and increased longevity. They use holograms to fake miracles. Carnal beings with gender, they stopped training to achieve the Kingdom of God thousands of years ago. Heaven's Gate believed that all existing religions on Earth had been corrupted by these malevolent aliens.\n\nAlthough these basic beliefs of the group stayed generally consistent over the years, \"the details of their ideology were flexible enough to undergo modification over time.\" There are examples of the group's adding to or slightly changing their beliefs, such as: modifying the way one can enter the Next Level, changing the way they described themselves, placing more importance on the idea of Satan, and adding several other New Age concepts. One of these concepts was the belief of extraterrestrial walk-ins; when the group began, \"Applewhite and Nettles taught their followers that they were extraterrestrial beings. However, after the notion of walk-ins became popular within the New Age subculture, the Two changed their tune and began describing themselves as extraterrestrial walk-ins.\" The idea of walk-ins is very similar to the concept of being possessed by spirits. A walk-in can be defined as \"an entity who occupies a body that has been vacated by its original soul\". Heaven's Gate came to believe an extraterrestrial walk-in is \"a walk-in that is supposedly from another planet.\"\n\nThe concept of walk-ins aided Applewhite and Nettles in personally starting from what they considered to be clean slates. In this so-called clean slate, they were no longer considered by members of this Heaven's Gate group to be the people they had been prior to the start of the group, but had taken on a new life; this concept gave them a way to \"erase their human personal histories as the histories of souls who formerly occupied the bodies of Applewhite and Nettles.\"\n\nAnother New Age belief Applewhite and Nettles adopted was the ancient astronaut hypothesis. The term \"ancient astronauts\" is used to refer to various forms of the concept that extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past. Applewhite and Nettles took part of this concept and taught it as the belief that \"aliens planted the seeds of current humanity millions of years ago, and have to come to reap the harvest of their work in the form of spiritually evolved individuals who will join the ranks of flying saucer crews. Only a select few members of humanity will be chosen to advance to this transhuman state. The rest will be left to wallow in the spiritually poisoned atmosphere of a corrupt world.\" Only the individuals who chose to join Heaven's Gate, follow Applewhite and Nettle's belief system, and make the sacrifices required by membership would be allowed to escape human suffering.\n\nAccording to Heaven's Gate, once the individual has perfected himself through the \"process\", there were four methods to enter or \"graduate\" to the next level:\n\n\nOpen only to adults over the age of eighteen, group members gave up their possessions and lived a highly ascetic life devoid of many indulgences. The group was tightly knit and everything was shared communally. In public, members always carried only a five-dollar bill and one roll of quarters. Eight of the male members of the group, including Applewhite, voluntarily underwent castration in Mexico as an extreme means of maintaining the ascetic lifestyle.\n\nThe group earned revenues by offering professional website development for paying clients under the name \"Higher Source\".\n\nThe cultural theorist Paul Virilio has described the group as a cybersect, due to its heavy reliance on computer mediated communication as a mode of communication prior to the group's collective suicide.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "166080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166080", "title": "Historicity of the Bible", "text": "Historicity of the Bible\n\nThe historicity of the Bible is the question of the Bible's \"acceptability as a history\", in the words of Thomas L. Thompson, a scholar who has written widely on this topic as it relates to the Old Testament. This can be extended to the question of the Christian New Testament as an accurate record of the historical Jesus and the Apostolic Age.\n\nMany fields of study span the Bible and history; such fields range from archeology and astronomy to linguistics and comparative literature. Scholars also examine the historical context of Bible passages, the importance ascribed to events by the authors, and the contrast between the descriptions of these events and other historical evidence.\n\nArchaeological discoveries since the 19th century are open to interpretation, but broadly speaking they lend support to few of the Old Testament's narratives as history and offer evidence to challenge others.\n\nThe Bible exists in multiple manuscripts, none of them an autograph, and multiple canons, which do not completely agree on which books have sufficient authority to be included or their order (see Books of the Bible). The early discussions about the exclusion or integration of various apocrypha involve an early idea about the historicity of the core. The Ionian Enlightenment influenced early patrons like Justin Martyr and Tertullian – both saw the biblical texts as being different to (and having more historicity than) the myths of other religions. Augustine was aware of the difference between science and scripture and defended the historicity of the biblical texts e.g. against claims of Faustus of Mileve.\n\nHistorians hold that the Bible should not be treated differently from other historical (or literary) sources from the ancient world. One may compare doubts about the historicity of e.g. Herodotus; the consequence of these discussions is not that we shall have to stop using ancient sources for historical reconstruction, but that we need to be aware of the problems involved when doing so.\n\nVery few texts survive directly from antiquity: most have been copied – some, many times. To determine the accuracy of a copied manuscript, textual critics examine the way the transcripts have passed through history to their extant forms. The higher the consistency of the earliest texts, the greater their textual reliability, and the less chance that the content has been changed over the years. Multiple copies may also be grouped into text types (see New Testament text types), with some types judged closer to the hypothetical original than others. Differences often extend beyond minor variations and may involve, for instance, interpolation of passages central to issues of historicity and doctrine, such as the .\n\nThe meaning of the term \"history\" is itself dependent on social and historical context. Paula McNutt, for instance, notes that the Old Testament narratives \"do not record 'history' \"in the sense that history is understood in the twentieth century\" ... The past, for biblical writers as well as for twentieth-century readers of the Bible, has meaning only when it is considered in light of the present, and perhaps an idealized future.\"\n\nEven from the earliest times, there was an awareness that parts of the scriptures could not be interpreted as a strictly consistent sequence of events. The Talmud cites a dictum ascribed to the third-century teacher Abba Arika that \"there is no chronological order in the Torah\". Examples were often presented and discussed in later Jewish exegesis with, according to Abraham Joshua Heschel, an ongoing discourse between those who would follow the views of Rabbi Ishmael that \"the Torah speaks in human language\", compared to the more mystical approach of Rabbi Akiva that any such deviations should signpost some deeper order or purpose, to be divined.\n\nDuring the modern era, the focus of Biblical history has also diversified. The project of biblical archaeology associated with W.F. Albright, which sought to validate the historicity of the events narrated in the Bible through the ancient texts and material remains of the Near East, has a more specific focus compared to the more expansive view of history described by archaeologist William Dever. In discussing the role of his discipline in interpreting the biblical record, Dever has pointed to multiple histories within the Bible, including the history of theology (the relationship between God and believers), political history (usually the account of \"Great Men\"), narrative history (the chronology of events), intellectual history (ideas and their development, context and evolution), socio-cultural history (institutions, including their social underpinnings in family, clan, tribe and social class and the state), cultural history (overall cultural evolution, demography, socio-economic and political structure and ethnicity), technological history (the techniques by which humans adapt to, exploit and make use of the resources of their environment), natural history (how humans discover and adapt to the ecological facts of their natural environment), and material history (artifacts as correlates of changes in human behaviour).\n\nA special challenge for assessing the historicity of the Bible is sharply differing perspectives on the relationship between narrative history and theological meaning. Supporters of biblical literalism \"deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood.\" But prominent scholars have expressed diametrically opposing views: \"[T]he stories about the promise given to the patriarchs in Genesis are not historical, nor do they intend to be historical; they are rather historically determined expressions about Israel and Israel's relationship to its God, given in forms legitimate to their time, and their truth lies not in their facticity, nor in the historicity, but their ability to express the reality that Israel experienced.\"\n\nA central pillar of the Bible's historical authority was the tradition that it had been composed by the principal actors or eyewitnesses to the events described – the Pentateuch was the work of Moses, Joshua was by Joshua, and so on. But the Protestant Reformation had brought the actual texts to a much wider audience, which combined with the growing climate of intellectual ferment in the 17th century that was the start of the Age of Enlightenment threw a harsh sceptical spotlight on these traditional claims. In Protestant England, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in his major work Leviathan (1651) denied Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, and identified Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles as having been written long after the events they purported to describe. His conclusions rested on internal textual evidence, but in an argument that resonates with modern debates, he noted: \"Who were the original writers of the several Books of Holy Scripture, has not been made evident by any sufficient testimony of other History, which is the only proof of matter of fact.\"\nThe Jewish philosopher and pantheist Baruch Spinoza echoed Hobbes's doubts about the provenance of the historical books in his \"A Theologico-Political Treatise\" (published in 1670), and elaborated on the suggestion that the final redaction of these texts was post-exilic under the auspices of Ezra (Chapter IX). He had earlier been effectively excommunicated by the rabbinical council of Amsterdam for his perceived heresies. The French priest Richard Simon brought these critical perspectives to the Catholic tradition in 1678, observing \"the most part of the Holy Scriptures that are come to us, are but Abridgments and as Summaries of ancient Acts which were kept in the Registries of the Hebrews,\" in what was probably the first work of biblical textual criticism in the modern sense.\n\nIn response Jean Astruc, applying source criticism methods common in the analysis of classical secular texts to the Pentateuch, believed he could detect four different manuscript traditions, which he claimed Moses himself had redacted. (p. 62–64) His 1753 book initiated the school known as higher criticism that culminated in Julius Wellhausen formalising the documentary hypothesis in the 1870s, which identifies these narratives as the Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, and the Priestly source. While versions of the Documentary Hypothesis vary in the order in which they were composed, the circumstances of their composition, and the date of their redaction(s), their shared terminology continues to provide the framework for modern theories on the composite nature and origins of the Torah.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century the scholarly consensus was that the Pentateuch was the work of many authors writing from 1000 BCE (the time of David) to 500 BCE (the time of Ezra) and redacted c. 450, and as a consequence whatever history it contained was more often polemical than strictly factual – a conclusion reinforced by the then fresh scientific refutations of what were at the time widely classed as biblical mythologies.\n\nThere is a Christian tradition of criticism of the creation narratives in Genesis dating back to at least St Augustine of Hippo (354–430), and Jewish tradition has also maintained a critical thread in its approach to biblical primeval history. The influential medieval philosopher Maimonides maintained a skeptical ambiguity toward creation \"ex nihilo\" and considered the stories about Adam more as \"philosophical anthropology, rather than as historical stories whose protagonist is the 'first man'.\" Greek philosophers Aristotle, Critolaus and Proclus held that the world was eternal. Such interpretations are inconsistent with what was after the Protestant Reformation to be \"commonly perceived in evangelicalism as traditional views of Genesis\".\n\nThe publication of James Hutton's \"Theory of the Earth\" in 1788 was an important development in the scientific revolution that would dethrone Genesis as the ultimate authority on primeval earth and prehistory. The first casualty was the Creation story itself, and by the early 19th century \"no responsible scientist contended for the literal credibility of the Mosaic account of creation.\" The battle between uniformitarianism and catastrophism kept the Flood alive in the emerging discipline, until Adam Sedgwick, the president of the Geological Society, publicly recanted his previous support in his 1831 presidential address:We ought indeed to have paused before we first adopted the diluvian theory, and referred all our old superficial gravel to the action of the Mosaic Flood. For of man, and the works of his hands, we have not yet found a single trace among the remnants of the former world entombed in those deposits.\nAll of which left the \"first man\" and his putative descendants in the awkward position of being stripped of all historical context, until Charles Darwin naturalized the Garden of Eden with the publication of \"On The Origin of Species\" in 1859. Public acceptance of this scientific revolution was, at the time, uneven, but has since grown significantly. The mainstream scholarly community soon arrived at a consensus, which holds today, that Genesis 1–11 is a highly schematic literary work representing theology/symbolic mythology rather than actual history or science.\n\nIn the following decades Hermann Gunkel drew attention to the mythic aspects of the Pentateuch, and Albrecht Alt, Martin Noth and the tradition history school argued that although its core traditions had genuinely ancient roots, the narratives were fictional framing devices and were not intended as history in the modern sense. Though doubts have been cast on the historiographic reconstructions of this school (particularly the notion of oral traditions as a primary ancient source), much of its critique of biblical historicity found wide acceptance. Gunkel's observation that\n\nhas in various forms become a commonplace of contemporary criticism.\n\nIn the United States the biblical archaeology movement, under the influence of Albright, counterattacked, arguing that the broad outline within the framing narratives was also true, so that while scholars could not realistically expect to prove or disprove individual episodes from the life of Abraham and the other patriarchs, these were real individuals who could be placed in a context proven from the archaeological record. But as more discoveries were made, and anticipated finds failed to materialise, it became apparent that archaeology did not in fact support the claims made by Albright and his followers. Today, only a minority of scholars continue to work within this framework, mainly for reasons of religious conviction. William Dever stated in 1993 that\n\nMany scholars believe that the 'Deuteronomistic History’ preserved elements of ancient texts and oral tradition, including geo-political and socio-economic realities and certain information about historical figures and events. However, large portions of it are legendary and it contains many anachronisms.\n\nA major issue in the historicity debate was the narrative of the Israelite conquest of Canaan, described in Joshua and Judges. The American Albright school asserted that the biblical narrative of conquest would be affirmed by archaeological record; and indeed for much of the 20th century archaeology appeared to support the biblical narrative, including excavations at Beitin (identified as Bethel), Tel ed-Duweir, (identified as Lachish), Hazor, and Jericho.\n\nHowever, flaws in the conquest narrative appeared. The most high-profile example was the \"fall of Jericho\", excavated by John Garstang in the 1930s. Garstang originally announced that he had found fallen walls dating to the time of the biblical Battle of Jericho, but later revised the destruction to a much earlier period. Kathleen Kenyon dated the destruction of the walled city to the middle of the 16th century ( 1550 BCE), too early to match the usual dating of the Exodus to Pharaoh Ramses, on the basis of her excavations in the early 1950s. The same conclusion, based on an analysis of all the excavation findings, was reached by Piotr Bienkowski. By the 1960s it had become clear that the archaeological record did not, in fact, support the account of the conquest given in Joshua: the cities which the Bible records as having been destroyed by the Israelites were either uninhabited at the time, or, if destroyed, were destroyed at widely different times, not in one brief period.\nAccording to Israel Finkelstein, the consensus for the conquest narrative was abandoned in the late 20th century.\n\nIn his view, the Book of Joshua conflates several independent battles between disparate groups over the centuries, and artificially attributes them to a single leader, Joshua. However, there are a few cases where the biblical record is not contradicted by the archaeological record. For example, stratum in Tel Hazor, found in a destruction layer from around 1200 BCE, shows signs of catastrophic fire, and cuneiform tablets found at the site refer to monarchs named \"Ibni Addi\", where \"Ibni\" may be the etymological origin of \"Yavin\" (\"Jabin\"), the Canaanite leader referred to in the Hebrew Bible. The city also show signs of having been a magnificent Canaanite city prior to its destruction, with great temples and opulent palaces, split into an upper acropolis, and lower city; the town evidently had been a major Canaanite city. Finklestein theorized that the destruction of Hazor was the result of civil strife, attacks by the Sea Peoples, and/or a result of the general collapse of civilization across the whole eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age, rather than being caused by the Israelites.\n\nThe Books of Samuel are considered to be based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in Deuteronomy. The battles involving the destruction of the Canaanites are not supported by archaeological record, and it is now widely believed that the Israelites themselves originated as a sub-group of Canaanites. The Books of Samuel exhibit too many anachronisms to have been compiled in the 11th century BCE. For example, there is mention of later armor (1 Samuel 17:4–7, 38–39; 25:13), use of camels (1 Samuel 30:17), and cavalry (as distinct from chariotry) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31), sophisticated siege techniques (2 Samuel 20:15). There is a gargantuan troop (2 Samuel 17:1), a battle with 20,000 casualties (2 Samuel 18:7), and a reference to Kushite paramilitary and servants, clearly giving evidence of a date in which Kushites were common, after the 26th Dynasty of Egypt, the period of the last quarter of the 8th century BCE.\n\nMuch of the focus of modern criticism has been the historicity of the \"United Monarchy\" of Israel, which according to the Hebrew Bible ruled over both Judea and Samaria around the 10th century BCE.\nThomas L. Thompson, a leading minimalist scholar for example has written-\n\nIn Iron Age IIa (corresponding to the Monarchal period) Judah seems to have been limited to small, mostly rural and unfortified settlements in the Judean hills. This contrasts to the upper Samaria which was becoming urbanized. This archaeological evidence as well as textual criticism has led many modern historians to treat Israel/Samaria and Judah as arising separately as distinct albeit related entities centered at Shechem and Jerusalem respectively, and not as a united kingdom with a capital in Jerusalem.\n\nExcavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, an Iron site located in Judah, support the biblical account of a United Monarchy. The Israel Antiquities Authority stated: \"The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.\"\n\nThe status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate. The oldest part of Jerusalem and its original urban core is the City of David, which does not show evidence of significant Israelite residential activity until the 9th century. However, unique administrative structures such as the Stepped Stone Structure and the Large Stone Structure, which originally formed one structure, contain material culture dated to Iron I. On account of the apparent lack of settlement activity in the 10th century BCE, Israel Finkelstein argues that Jerusalem in the century was a small country village in the Judean hills, not a national capital, and Ussishkin argues that the city was entirely uninhabited. Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I/Iron IIa dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct, (as he believes) \"Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity.\"\n\nSince Jerusalem has been destroyed and then subsequently rebuilt approximately 15 to 20 times since the time of David and Solomon, some argue much of the evidence of 10th century habitation could easily have been eliminated. However, Israel Finkelstein notes that significant architecture from later in the Iron Age (Iron IIb) has been found.\n\nSince the discovery of the Tel Dan Stele dated to the 9th or 8th century BCE containing \"b y t d w d\", accepted as a reference to the \"House of David\" as a monarchic dynasty in Judah (another possible reference occurs in the Mesha Stele), the majority of scholars accept the existence of a polity ruled by David and Solomon, albeit on a more modest scale than described in the Bible.\n\nThe historicity of some New Testament teachings of Jesus is also debated by biblical scholars. The \"quest for the historical Jesus\" began as early as the 18th century, and has continued to this day. The most notable recent scholarship came in the 1980s and 1990s with the work of J. D. Crossan, James D. G. Dunn, John P. Meier, E. P. Sanders and N. T. Wright being the most widely read and discussed. The earliest New Testament texts which refer to Jesus, Paul's letters, are usually dated in the 50s CE. Since Paul records very little of Jesus' life and activities, these are of little help in determining facts about the life of Jesus, although they may contain references to information given to Paul from the eyewitnesses of Jesus.\n\nThe discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has shed light into the context of 1st century Judea, noting the diversity of Jewish belief as well as shared expectations and teachings. For example, the expectation of the coming messiah, the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount and much else of the early Christian movement are found to have existed within apocalyptic Judaism of the period. This has had the effect of centering Early Christianity much more within its Jewish roots than was previously the case. It is now recognised that Rabbinical Judaism and \"Early Christianity\" are only two of the many strands which survived until the Jewish revolt of 66 to 70 CE, see also Split of early Christianity and Judaism.\n\nAlmost all historical critics agree that a historical figure named Jesus taught throughout the Galilean countryside c. 30 CE, was believed by his followers to have performed supernatural acts, and was sentenced to death by the Romans, possibly for insurrection.\n\nMost modern scholars hold that the canonical Gospel accounts were written between 70 and 100 or 110 CE, four to eight decades after the crucifixion, although based on earlier traditions and texts, such as \"Q\", Logia or \"sayings gospels\", the passion account or other earlier literature (See List of Gospels). Some scholars argue that these accounts were compiled by witnesses although this view is disputed by other scholars. A review of Richard Bauckham's book \"Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony\" states \"The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing.\" There are also secular references to Jesus, although they are few and quite late.\n\nMany scholars have pointed out that the Gospel of Mark shows signs of a lack of knowledge of geographical, political and religious matters in Judea in the time of Jesus. Thus, today the most common opinion is that the author is unknown and both geographically and historically at a distance to the narrated events although opinion varies and scholars such as Craig Blomberg accept the more traditional view. The use of expressions that may be described as awkward and rustic cause the Gospel of Mark to appear somewhat unlettered or even crude. This may be attributed to the influence that Saint Peter, a fisherman, is suggested to have on the writing of Mark. It is commonly thought that the writers of the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke used Mark as a source, with changes and improvement to peculiarities and crudities in Mark.\n\nArchaeological inscriptions and other independent sources show that Acts contains some accurate details of 1st century society with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. However, the historicity of the depiction of Paul the Apostle in Acts is contested. Acts describes Paul differently from how Paul describes himself, both factually and theologically. Acts differs with Paul's letters on important issues, such as the Law, Paul's own , and his relation to the Jerusalem church. Scholars generally prefer Paul's account over that in Acts.\n\nAn educated reading of the biblical text requires knowledge of when it was written, by whom, and for what purpose. For example, many academics would agree that the Pentateuch was in existence some time shortly after the 6th century BCE, but they disagree about when it was written. Proposed dates vary from the 15th century BCE to the 6th century BCE. One popular hypothesis points to the reign of Josiah (7th century BCE). In this hypothesis, the events of, for example, Exodus would have happened centuries before they were finally edited. This topic is expanded upon in dating the Bible.\n\nAn important point to keep in mind is the documentary hypothesis, which, using the biblical evidence itself, claims to demonstrate that our current version is based on older written sources that are lost. Although it has been modified heavily over the years, most scholars accept some form of this hypothesis. There have also been and are a number of scholars who reject it, for example Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and Old Testament scholar Walter Kaiser, Jr., as well as R. N. Whybray, Umberto Cassuto, O. T. Allis, Gleason Archer, John Sailhamer, and Bruce Waltke.\n\nThere is great scholarly controversy on the historicity of events recounted in the Biblical narratives prior to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE.There is split between scholars who reject the Biblical account of Ancient Israel as fundamentally ahistorical, and those who accept it as a largely reliable source of history-termed biblical minimalists and biblical maximalists respectively. The major split of biblical scholarship into two opposing schools is strongly disapproved by non-fundamentalist biblical scholars, as being an attempt by conservative Christians to portray the field as a bipolar argument, of which only one side is correct.\n\nRecently the difference between the Maximalist and Minimalist has reduced, and a new school started with a work, \"The Quest for the Historical Israel: Debating Archaeology and the History of Early Israel\" by Israel Finkelstein, Amihai Mazar, and Brian B. Schmidt. This school argues that post-processual archaeology enables us to recognize the existence of a middle ground between Minimalism and Maximalism, and that both these extremes need to be rejected. Archaeology offers both confirmation of parts of the biblical record and also poses challenges to the interpretations made by some. The careful examination of the evidence demonstrates that the historical accuracy of the first part of the Old Testament is greatest during the reign of Josiah. Some feel that the accuracy diminishes the further backwards one proceeds from this date. This, they claim, would confirm that a major redaction of the texts seems to have occurred at about that date.\n\nThe viewpoint sometimes called Biblical minimalism generally holds that the Bible is principally a theological and apologetic work, and all stories within it are of an aetiological character. The early stories are held to have a historical basis that was reconstructed centuries later, and the stories possess at most only a few tiny fragments of genuine historical memory–which by their definition are only those points which are supported by archaeological discoveries. In this view, all of the stories about the biblical patriarchs are fictional, and the patriarchs mere legendary eponyms to describe later historical realities. Further, biblical minimalists hold that the twelve tribes of Israel were a later construction, the stories of King David and King Saul were modeled upon later Irano-Hellenistic examples, and that there is no archaeological evidence that the united Kingdom of Israel, which the Bible says that David and Solomon ruled over an empire from the Euphrates to Eilath, ever existed. Archaeological evidence suggesting otherwise, such as the Mesha Stele, is often rejected as allegorical.\n\nIn published books, one of the early advocates of the current school of thought known as biblical minimalism is Giovanni Garbini, \"Storia e ideologia nell'Israele antico\" (1986), translated into English as \"History and Ideology in Ancient Israel\" (1988). In his footsteps followed Thomas L. Thompson with his lengthy \"Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written & Archaeological Sources\" (1992) and, building explicitly on Thompson's book, P. R. Davies' shorter work, \"In Search of 'Ancient Israel' \" (1992). In the latter, Davies finds historical Israel only in archaeological remains, biblical Israel only in scripture, and recent reconstructions of \"ancient Israel\" to be an unacceptable amalgam of the two. Thompson and Davies see the entire Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) as the imaginative creation of a small community of Jews at Jerusalem during the period which the Bible assigns to after the return from the Babylonian exile, from 539 BCE onward. Niels Peter Lemche, Thompson's fellow faculty member at the University of Copenhagen, also followed with several titles that show Thompson's influence, including \"The Israelites in history and tradition\" (1998). The presence of both Thompson and Lemche at the same institution has led to the use of the term \"Copenhagen school\". The effect of biblical minimalism from 1992 onward was debate with more than two points of view.|\n\nThere is great scholarly controversy on the historicity particularly of those events recounted in the Biblical narratives prior to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE. Regarding the debate over the historicity of ancient Israel, the maximalist position holds that the accounts of the United Monarchy and the early kings of Israel, David and Saul, are to be taken as largely historical.\n\nIn 2001, Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman published \"The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts\" which advocated a view midway toward biblical minimalism and caused an uproar among many conservatives. In the 25th anniversary issue of \"Biblical Archaeology Review\" (March/April 2001 edition), editor Hershel Shanks quoted several biblical scholars who insisted that minimalism was dying, although leading minimalists deny this and a claim has been made \"We are all minimalists now\" (an allusion to We are all Keynesians now).\n\nIn 2003, Kenneth Kitchen, a scholar who adopts a more maximalist point of view, authored the book \"On the Reliability of the Old Testament\". Kitchen advocated the reliability of many (although not all) parts of the Torah and in no uncertain terms criticizes the work of Finkelstein and Silberman, to which Finkelstein has since responded.\n\nJennifer Wallace describes archaeologist Israel Finkelstein's view in her article \"Shifting Ground in the Holy Land\", appearing in \"Smithsonian Magazine\", May 2006:\nHowever, despite problems with the archaeological record, some maximalists place Joshua in the mid-second millennium, at about the time the Egyptian Empire came to rule over Canaan, and not the 13th century as Finkelstein or Kitchen claim, and view the destruction layers of the period as corroboration of the biblical account. The destruction of Hazor in the mid-13th century is seen as corroboration of the biblical account of the later destruction carried out by Deborah and Barak as recorded in the Book of Judges. The location that Finkelstein refers to as \"Ai\" is generally dismissed as the location of the biblical Ai, since it was destroyed and buried in the 3rd millennium. The prominent site has been known by that name since at least Hellenistic times, if not before. Minimalists all hold that dating these events as contemporary are etiological explanations written centuries after the events they claim to report.\n\nBoth Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were really existing persons (not kings but bandit leaders or hill country chieftains) from Judah about the 10th century BCE, but they do not assume that there was such a thing as United Monarchy with a capital in Jerusalem.\n\nOthers, such as David Ussishkin, argue that those who follow the biblical depiction of a United Monarchy do so on the basis of limited evidence while hoping to uncover real archaeological proof in the future. Gunnar Lehmann suggests that there is still a possibility that David and Solomon were able to become local chieftains of some importance and claims that Jerusalem at the time was at best a small town in a sparsely populated area in which alliances of tribal kinship groups formed the basis of society. He goes on further to claim that it was at best a small regional centre, one of three to four in the territory of Judah and neither David nor Solomon had the manpower or the requisite social/political/administrative structure to rule the kind of empire described in the Bible.\n\nThese views are strongly criticized by William G. Dever, Helga Weippert, Amihai Mazar and Amnon Ben-Tor.\n\nAndré Lemaire states in \"Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple\" that the principal points of the biblical tradition with Solomon as generally trustworthy, as does Kenneth Kitchen, who argue that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy \"mini-empire\", rather than a small city-state.\n\nRecently, Finkelstein has joined with the more conservative Amihai Mazar to explore the areas of agreement and disagreement and there are signs the intensity of the debate between the so-called minimalist and maximalist scholars is diminishing. This view is also taken by Richard S. Hess, which shows there is in fact a plurality of views between maximalists and minimalists. Jack Cargill has shown that popular textbooks not only fail to give readers up to date archaeological evidence, but that they also fail to correctly represent the diversity of views present on the subject. And Megan Bishop Moore and Brad E. Kelle provide an overview of the respective evolving approaches and attendant controversies, especially during the period from the mid-1980s through 2011, in their book \"Biblical History and Israel's Past\".\n\n\n\n"}

While still a student at the Instituto Ramiro de Maeztu he published his first book, \"Man of God: Psalms, elegies and prayers\", which was funded by the Institute. Although Damaso Alonso tempted him to study philology, Valverde pursued Philosophy; his doctorate included a thesis on Wilhelm von Humboldt's philosophy of language. That same year he married Pilar Gefaell, with whom he had five children, including Mariana Valverde, a Professor of Criminology at the University of Toronto.\n\nHe wrote in various magazines: \"La Estafeta Literaria\", \"Escorial\", \"Works and Days\", \"Root\", and the \"Ensign and Journal of Aesthetic Ideas\", at times using the pseudonym \"Gambrinus\". His essays were later collected in \"The Art of the Article (1949–1993)\" (Barcelona, 1994). He also published in poetic magazines including Garcilaso, Espadaña, Proel. Between 1950 and 1955, Valverde lived in Rome, where he was reader of Spanish at Sapienza University of Rome and at the Spanish Institute, and met Benedetto Croce. At age 29 in 1956, he obtained the chair of Aesthetics at the University of Barcelona. This setting and his experiences as a professor inspired \"The conquest of the world\" (1960). He participated in the literary magazines of the time and in numerous periodicals, which published much of his thinking. He himself said he was a poet rather than a philosopher, and not vice versa. He was devoted to the study of history of ideas. Collaborating with Martí de Riquer i Morera in an ambitious History of literature (1957, greatly expanded later) and writing a Life and death of ideas: small stories thoughts (1981), he launched his award-winning translations of classics of literature in English and German. With a clear social and political commitment, Christian and anti-Franco, he supported the popular cause in Central America (Cuba, the Sandinistas: relating to exiled Nicaraguan poets Julio Ycaza, Luis Rocha and Fernando Silva.) For political reasons (solidarity with teachers Enrique Tierno Galván, José Luis Aranguren and Agustin Garcia Calvo who were expelled from the University of Madrid by Franco), he resigned his professorship in 1964 and went into exile. He is credited with the now famous phrase, written on the blackboard in farewell: \"Nulla aesthetica sine ethica. Ergo apaga y vámonos.\" He went to the United States, where he was professor of Hispanic and comparative literature (University of Virginia, McMaster) and then to Canada where he was a professor of Spanish literature at Trent University. This experience is part of his poem \"The Tower of Babel falls on the poet\":\n\n<poem>\n\"Mature in age and poetry\nyou moved to a foreign speaking country,\nand it is not living. What they say here,\nia easy as breathing, easy, rich, accurate,\nyou're trying to mimic them with effort,\nand hear your voice, ridiculous and strange,\nfail as a child always right here,\nend up saying something not yours.\nNow I am alien to the landscape:\ndo not talk to you: to the bird and the tree\nand the river spared you the legends\nwrap their names here-in you tags.\nIn vain you smile to others\npolite, and even friends, cheering\nfrom the language in which they are the masters:\nfails to love them: you forget:\nthe depths of your spirit does not beat\ndoes not live in the language that is your history.\"\n(Ser de palabra, 1973).\n</poem>\n\nBefore returning to Spain, he published in 1971 Teachings of Age (Poetry 1945–1970), a volume collecting the first six books of poems. He returned to Spain and his professorship in 1975 (according to some), in 1977 according to others. The editorial Trotta in Madrid has undertaken the publication of his Complete Works, which led to his writing four volumes: the first of Poetry (1998), the second and third of aesthetics and literary theory, and the fourth in the history of ideas. He died in Barcelona in 1996, at seventy years of a terminal illness, while devoting his energies to investigate the latest work of Kierkegaard.\n\nIn his critical work is worth mentioning Studies on the poetic word (1952), Humboldt and the philosophy of language (1955), History of literature (1957), Letters to a skeptical priest in modern art (1959), Life and death of ideas: small stories thoughts (1981), Aesthetic Dictionary or monographs on Azorín (1971), Antonio Machado (1975), James Joyce (1978 and 1982), or Nietzsche.\n\nOf importance are his German translations (Hölderlin, Rilke, Goethe, Novalis, Brecht, Christian Morgenstern, Hans Urs von Balthasar) and English (theater: complete Shakespeare prose, likewise those of Charles Dickens, T. S. Eliot, Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Saul Bellow, Thomas Merton, Edgar Allan Poe, Emily Dickinson, or Joyce's Ulysses (novel), for which he received the Translation Prize Fray Luis de León, 1977). In 1960 he received the same award for a collection of Rainer Maria Rilke. In 1990 he was also awarded National Award for the work of a translator. Also translated some poems of Constantine Cavafy from Modern Greek, the New Testament from Ancient Greek, and Romano Guardini from Italian.\n\nHe prepared, in addition, critical editions of Antonio Machado, one of his favorite authors (New Songs, In an apocryphal songbook and Juan de Mairena) and Azorín (Forgotten Items and Peoples), anthologies of general Spanish and Latin American poetry and specially Luis Felipe Vivanco, Miguel de Unamuno and Ernesto Cardenal. The problems of contemporary art in his book resonated in Letters to a skeptical priest in modern art (1959).\n\nHe was especially concerned with a particular stream of existentialism: Christian man in what he called, with Damaso Alonso in the prologue to a book of his, uprooted poetry. His early poems have a religious theme. Then he introduced new issues in his poetry, more human, closer to Marxist approaches. It has been said that he was a Christian Marxist, with an approach close to the thesis Liberation Theology. His work is characterized by a marked humanism with intimate touches, making him one of the brightest figures of Spanish poetry scene.\n\nA poet of organic books, where the whole is greater than the sum of the constituent poems, his style is characterized by simplicity and expressive language (almost conversational), always looking for openness, purity and precision, without unnecessary rhetoric, in the tradition of Antonio Machado. That desire led him to remove numerous poems from his latest compilation, making it successively smaller. Some of this can be seen in his famous poem about the hanged François Villon. He preferred to express himself in Arte Mayor and the alexandrine.\n\nHe received inter alia, the National Poetry Award in 1949, the Critics Award in 1962 and the Ciutat de Barcelona Prize for his Collected poems 1945–1990. In poetry, his books include Hombre de Dios in 1945, La espera in 1949,\nVersos del domingo in 1954, Voces y acompañamientos para San Mateo in 1959, La conquista de este mundo in 1960, Años inciertos in 1970, and Ser de palabra in 1976.\n\nHis personal archive is located in the Pavelló de la República CRAI Library – University of Barcelona . It consists of published and not published writings, handwritten translations and notes; writer's personal papers, letters sent and/or received by José María Valverde, press clippings, tributes and condolence letters written to the Valverde family.\n\nEditorial Trotta has published Complete Works:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4465206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4465206", "title": "Kumbhaka", "text": "Kumbhaka\n\n\"Kumbhaka\" is the pause between an inhale and exhale. According to B.K. S. Iyengar in \"Light on Yoga\", the \"retention or holding the breath, a state where there is no inhalation or exalation\". Mr. Iyengar also notes that in some yoga texts the term is used generically to indicate all three parts of the breath: inhale, exhale, and pauses. Along with the inhale and exhale, the kumbhaka is essential to any practice of pranayama. To further clarify the teachings of \"pranayama\" the k\"humbhaka\" which follows the exhale is called the \"bahya kumbhaka\" and that which follows the inhale is called the \"antara kumbhaka\". (\"Bahya\" means outer/exterior. \"Antara\" means inner/interior.)\n\nRespiration includes inhalation and exhalation. In between these two processes there is a very minute gap or pause (normally in milliseconds) which is usually not noticed and it recurs, i.e., inhalation-pause-exhalation-pause-inhalation... and it continues. The maximum gap or pause is observed in the state of rest. Kumbhak enforces to increase the pause by ceasing the breath routinely and continuously by various types of pranayama and kumbhaka exercises.\n\nIt has been said that \"It is being observed that the more time spent for pranayama (and kumbhaka); the more is the concentration and the better is the control over mind.\" Various ancient yogis (expert in yoga and pranayama) noticed the importance of respiration and its correlation with activities of mind and vital forces. Aging is also seen proportional to frequency of respiration or respiratory rate, i.e., frequency of inhalation and exhalation in one minute. Medical science recorded normal respiratory rate in humans as 12-16 breaths per minute with life span of 70–80 years. These figures may vary due to geographical, communal and other distribution factors.\n\nRecent researches in the field of Bahir-Kumbhaka demonstrate the impact on cerebral circulation, with an increase in end diastolic velocity (EDV), mean flow velocity (MFV) along with pulsatility index (PI). Another study demonstrated an increase in heart rate variability with a possible shift of autonomic balance towards sympathetic activity. It was also found to enhance response inhibition.\n\nAging is proportional to respiratory rate (excluding exceptions), e.g.,\n\nThough the level of consciousness varies from species to species, it is seen highest in humans where conscious mind can provoke to perform activities and exercises as per wishes and this voluntary performance is not up to such an extent in any other species and consequently all other species cannot cease their breath as and when desired (voluntarily). Some species (e.g., whales) can take enormous air and cease it for a long time but that is spontaneous requirement and involuntary; and it is the necessity for them to survive this way.\n\nPracticing kumbhaka for a long time increases endurance of physiological as well as psychological structure of an individual. Continuous and long term practicing increases the hold or control on breath up to an extent where it reaches to its extreme stage (Kevali Kumbhak) and the respiration is ceased permanently unless desired to get into normal state.\n\nAging is proportional to metabolism which in turn is proportional to respiratory rate. Metabolism lowers down as the respiratory rate decreases and this helps prevent aging or at least lowers down the process. It has not been recorded scientifically whether kevali kumbhaka can increase age (or can make immortality a fact) by lowering down the basic reactions which support life, however, various yoga sutras and religious scriptures define samadhi and immortality an approachable aspiration for determined individuals.

{"id": "7893195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7893195", "title": "Libel tourism", "text": "Libel tourism\n\nLibel tourism is a term, first coined by Geoffrey Robertson, to describe forum shopping for libel suits. It particularly refers to the practice of pursuing a case in England and Wales, in preference to other jurisdictions, such as the United States, which provide more extensive defenses for those accused of making derogatory statements.\n\nA critic of English defamation law, journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft, attributes the practice to the introduction of no win no fee agreements, the presumption that derogatory statements are false, the difficulty of establishing fair comment and \"the caprice of juries and the malice of judges.\" Wheatcroft contrasts this with United States law since the \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\" case. \"Any American public figure bringing an action now has to prove that what was written was not only untrue but published maliciously and recklessly.\"\n\nTwo other critics of English defamation law, the US lawyers Samuel A. Abady and Harvey Silverglate, have cited the example of Irish–Saudi businessman Khalid bin Mahfouz, who by the time of his death in 2009, had threatened suit more than 40 times in England against those who accused him of funding terrorism. Mahfouz also took legal action in Belgium, France and Switzerland against those repeating the accusations. George W. Bush advisor Richard Perle threatened to sue investigative reporter Seymour Hersh in London, because of a series of critical articles Hersh had written about him. In 2006 American actress Kate Hudson won a libel action in England against the British edition of the \"National Enquirer\" magazine after it published an article suggesting she had an eating disorder.\n\nA series of cases involving US citizens being sued in English courts led to new laws in both countries. In the United States, the SPEECH Act unanimously passed the US Congress, which makes foreign defamation judgements unenforceable in US courts if they don't meet US free speech standards. In England and Wales, the Defamation Act 2013 requires plaintiffs to show that England is the proper jurisdiction to hear a case when the defendant does not live in England or Wales.\n\nIn 2000, the House of Lords gave Boris Berezovsky and Nikolai Glushkov permission to sue Forbes for libel in the English courts. In 2003 the case was settled when \"Forbes\" offered a partial retraction.\n\nThe issues relating to jurisdiction of the English courts in such actions were appealed to the House of Lords, at that time the highest court in England and Wales, making this the key test case on libel tourism.\n\nKhalid bin Mahfouz and two members of his family sued Rachel Ehrenfeld, an Israeli-born writer and United States citizen over her 2003 book on terrorist financing, \"Funding Evil\", which asserted that Mahfouz and his family provided financial support to Islamic terrorist groups. The book was not published in Britain, although 23 copies of her book had been purchased online through web sites registered in the UK, and excerpts from the book had been published globally on the ABC News web site. Ehrenfeld was advised by English lawyer Mark Stephens to claim that the suit in England violated her First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution and chose not to defend the action. Instead, she countersued in the U.S. In his 2005 judgment Justice Eady criticised Dr. Ehrenfeld for attempting to cash in on the libel action without being prepared to defend it on its merits and specifically rebutted her suggestion of forum shopping. Eady ruled that Ehrenfeld should pay £10,000 to each claimant plus costs, apologize for false allegations and destroy existing copies of her book.\n\nEady has been internationally criticized for his perceived bias in the case and his general restrictive approach to free speech. Additionally, the libel laws which were applied are under scrutiny in England, where calls for libel law reform have increased since Ehrenfeld's case. Analyzing English libel law, the United Nations Human Rights Committee cautioned that: \"practical application of the law of libel has served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work, including through the phenomenon known as \"libel tourism.\" The advent of the internet and the international distribution of foreign media also create the danger that a State party's unduly restrictive libel law will affect freedom of expression worldwide on matters of valid public interest.\"\n\nOn January 1st, 2014 a law was enacted (Defamation Act 2013) requiring plaintiffs who bring actions in the courts of England and Wales alleging libel by defendants who do not live in Europe to demonstrate that the court is the most appropriate place to bring the action. Serious harm to an individual's reputation or serious financial harm to a corporation must also be proven. Good faith belief that a disclosure was in the public interest was made a defense.\n\nThe Free Speech Protection Act of 2008 and 2009 were both bills aimed at addressing libel tourism by barring U.S. courts from enforcing libel judgments issued in foreign courts against U.S. residents, if the speech would not be libelous under American law. These protections were passed in the 2010 SPEECH Act which passed unanimously in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before being signed by US President Barack Obama on August 10, 2010.\n\nIn late December 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, based on a decision by the New York State Court of Appeals, ruled that the state's current \"long-arm\" statutes governing business transactions did not give it jurisdiction to protect author Ehrenfeld. The Court noted, however, that if the law were to change, Ehrenfeld could go back to court.\n\nOn Jan. 13, 2008, two members of the New York State Legislature, Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman (D-Queens) and Senator Dean Skelos (R-LI), introduced a \"Libel Terrorism Protection Act\" in both legislative houses (bills no. A09652 and S 6676-B) to amend the New York civil procedures in response to the Ehrenfeld case. The bill passed the New York State legislature on a rare unanimous vote. and on April 29, 2008 Gov. Paterson signed the bill into law. The Libel Terrorism Protection Act enables New York courts to assert jurisdiction over anyone who obtains a foreign libel judgment against a New York publisher or writer, and to limit enforcement to those judgments that satisfy \"the freedom of speech and press protections guaranteed by both the United States and New York Constitutions.\"\n\nIn October 2009, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law protections against libel tourism (California's Libel Tourism Act) that took effect January 1, 2010. The Act provides that California courts shall not recognize a foreign-country judgment if \"the judgment includes recovery for a claim of defamation unless the court determines that the defamation law applied by the foreign court provided at least as much protection for freedom of speech and the press as provided by both the United States and California Constitutions\" (CCCP sec. 1716(c)(9)) and other protections. (See Cal. Code of Civil Procedure sections 1716 and 1717, as amended by Chapter 579, Statutes of 2009 (SB 320 - Corbett).) (http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0301-0350/sb_320_bill_20091011_chaptered.pdf.) The law received significant bi-partisan support. (See CA Leg Counsel bill/vote records)\n\nIn August 2008, Illinois enacted a Libel Tourism law that is similar to the statute passed in New York. (See 735 ILL. COMP. STAT 5/12-621 (b)(7) (2009); 735 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/2-209 (b-5) (2009).)\n\nIn May 2009, Florida also enacted a Libel Tourism law similar to the law passed in New York.

These both share the same essential meaning and case frame.

This information can be expressed as concerning the speaker's identification with a participant\", \"camera angle\", and \"point of view\". \n\nFor example, in English, \"then John hit his brother\" is more acceptable than \"then John's brother was hit by him\". The former shows the speaker's empathy with John is greater than with his brother (John's brother). In contrast, in the latter, John's brother is the subject and him (John) is the by-agent. Thus, since the speaker's empathy with the subject, John's brother, is less than with him (John), then John's brother was hit by him is less acceptable than the former phrase.\n"}

She is a prize-winning writer of nonfiction, an essayist, feminist, and activist. Her contributions to the field of cultural studies of age include four books, the latest of which is \"Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America\" (2011). Other books of Gullette's that have been influential (in humanistic and cultural gerontology, history, literary and cultural criticism, sociology and anthropology, performance and film studies, life writing and narrative theory, fashion studies, and feminist health activism) include \"Aged by Culture\" (2004), \"Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife\" (1997); and \"Safe at Last in the Middle Years: The Invention of the Midlife Progress Novel\" (1988).\n\nMargaret Morganroth was born in Brooklyn, NY, the first child of Betty Morganroth and Martin Morganroth. She was educated through high school at public schools and received scholarships to go to college and graduate school. Morganroth Gullette holds a B.A. magna cum laude Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe College, a M.A. from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.\n\nBefore becoming a Scholar in the Women's Studies Research Center in 1996, she had previously worked at the Harvard-Danforth Center for Teaching and Learning and had been a visiting scholar at Harvard; the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe; Northeastern University; Wellesley Center for Research on Women. At the Danforth (now Bok) Center, she edited \"The Art and Craft of Teaching\". She continues to publish in the field of pedagogy and education. [citation needed]\n\nWorking in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, Gullette found a lost novel by the late nineteenth-century English feminist, Mona Caird, \"The Daughters of Danaus\", and wrote an introduction for the Feminist Press reissue. Early in the feminist second wave, she published a feminist children's book called \"The Lost Bellybutton\" (1976). [citation needed]\n\nShe was invited to be the George A. Miller Visiting Professor, at the Center for Advanced Studies, University of Illinois (Urbana/ Champaign), in the spring of 2000. She is an Advisory Editor to the new journal, \"Age, Culture, Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Journal\", and on the book series, Aging Studies in Europe (LIT Verlag). She is on the Advisory Committee of the European Network on Aging (ENAS). She was on the Advisory Committee of the \"Journal of Aging, the Humanities, and the Arts\", 2006 2010 and co editor, Age Studies Series, University Press of Virginia, 1993 1999.\n\nMike Hepworth, the late British cultural gerontologist (1957–2012), in a review of Gullette's work through 1999, calls her \"one of America's foremost critics of the concept of ageing as a universal and comprehensive process of decline. She is a formidable critic of biological essentialism, defender of social constructionism, and opponent of 'middle ageism'\" (Hepworth 1999, Abstract), and the author of an \"increasingly influential range of publications on the social construction of ageing\" (Hepworth 1999, 139) and the life course in the United States. Gullette emerged during the 1990s and beyond as \"the primary theorist and practitioner of what she called 'age studies'\" (Cole and Ray 2010, 17). Gullette named the field of \"age studies\" in 1993 (Gullette 1993, 45–46). The term is used by the Modern Language Association and in the humanities in preference to \"aging studies.\"\n\n\"Her principal thesis is that we are aged by culture. What she means is that much of what we experience as we get older is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing . . . but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish\" (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.\n\n\"Age studies sees 'age' and 'aging' in culture as resulting as much from ideologies as from biology\" (Ball 2006, 214). Gullette has said that she offers a radical social constructionism that pushes \"'the natural' out of context after context\" (Gullette 1997 246 n42). \"Neither Featherstone and Hepworth nor Gullette denied the existence of bodily ageing, although their work has at times been interpreted as coming near to doing so, with their emphasis on the cultural constitution of the body. . . . As a result, their work has been criticised by those who see it as endorsing a false dualism of the body and the self.\" (Twigg, 2007)\n\n\"Margaret Morganroth Gullette has documented ways in which the pervasive ageism of Western cultures is often coded into a narrative structure that associates old age with inevitable decline and decay. Although this 'decline ideology' might seem to work against the futurist assumption of redemptive hope, Gullette explains that we are trained to assume the decline of the old in order to make room for the more highly valued young. To counter this tendency, Gullette urges the proliferation of 'progress narratives,' which project 'a moving image of the self through its past and onward to its better future' (Port 2012, 5–6 ) One of her theoretical moves has been to undermine the binary between \"progress narrative,\" automatically applied to children and younger people; and \"decline narrative,\" automatically applied to people who have aged past midlife.\n\nGullette's term \"age autobiography\" is a call for individual authors to write more knowledgeably and critically about the mediated forces that insinuate themselves into our sense of \"aging.\" \"And once we begin to think age, a more mysterious and intangible project emerges: to discover what our own culture is serving up for us, and what each of us has consumed or resisted\" (Gullette 1993, 46). \"The term itself [\"the master narrative of aging\"] was coined by Margaret Morganroth Gullette and is designed to identify a recognizable ensemble of cultural practices. . . \" (Kunow 2011, 26). The \"master narrative of decline\" requires a single self going through a linear trajectory, while \"the portmanteau self\" is \"an active concept of aging as self narrated experience, the conscious, ongoing story of one's age identity\" (Gullette 1997: 220). Fragments of Gullette's own age autobiography appear in many of her nonfiction works. Cynthia Port singles out \"one powerful essay [in which] Gullette argues that the fashion system teaches us to detach ourselves from and then discard clothes and other no longer fashionable commodities as a means of training ourselves for our own obsolescence in old age\": \"The Other End of the Fashion Cycle: Practicing Loss, Learning Decline\" (Port 2012, n26).\n\nGullette has been called \"one of gerontology's few public intellectuals,\" who demonstrates \"how a scholar works to change the minds of general readers about aging and ageism\" (Ray and Cole 2010: 8). \"The whole point, as Gullette (1988, 1993, 1997) has vividly shown in her analyses of fictional representations of ageing, is to discover how our personal ideas about ageing (positive/ negative/ ambiguous) are shaped by our culture and are therefore open to the possibility of change\" (Hepworth 2000, 3). Convinced that our terminology about age is impoverished, she encourages the use of terms like \"aging-past-youth,\" aging-into-the-middle years,\" and \"aging-into-old age\" (Gullette 1998, 3–44). She argues in several books (1997, 2004, 2011) that collective sociopolitical changes are necessary.\n\n\"Staging Age\", edited by Valerie Barnes Lipscomb and Leni Marshall, gives credit to Gullette's work in establishing the field of age studies, and advancing concepts about how age can be considered a performance (Lipscomb and Marshall 2010, 1–3). She invented the term \"middle ageism\" (Gullette 1998, 3–44) to name the cluster of discriminations suffered by people in their middle years, from job discrimination to \"Boomer-bashing\" and decline discourse about sexuality, looks, and intellectual and cognitive competence. Other concepts developed by Gullette—such as \"age ideology,\" \"being aged by culture,\" and the use of \"progress narrative\" as a way out of the binary between \"positive aging\" and \"decline narrative\"—have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines.\n\nGullette's concepts and formulations have been disseminated through a number of chapters and essays or excerpts that have appeared in anthologies, including \n\"A Guide to Humanistic Studies in Aging\" (2010), \n\"Narratives of Life: Mediating Age\" (Munich 2009), \n\"Opposing Viewpoints: The Aging Population\" (2009), \n\"Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life.

(And Other Cultural Fictions)\" (1998); \n\"Aging and Gender in Literature: Studies in Creativity\" (1993). \nWorking as a freelance writer in parallel to her scholarly career, Gullette also publishes in mainstream, feminist, and progressive newspapers, magazines, and blogs. These include \"New York Times\" (Week in Review, Magazine, Arts), \"Nation\", \"Ms.\", \"Dissent\", \"Boston Globe\", \"Miami Herald\", \"Chicago Tribune\"; \"American Prospect\", \"American Scholar\"; and www.womensenews; www.salon.com, www.theforward.com; www.nextavenue.com, www.ontheissuesmagazine.com She has been interviewed on \"Brian Lehrer,\" \"The Callie Crossley Show,\" \"CultureShocks\", \"The Connection,\" RadioNation, WBAI, \"To the Best of Our Knowledge.\" \n\n\"In breadth of vision, scholarly integrity, and the sheer exhilaration of her writing, Gullette's work is essential reading for all who wish to understand the origins of the transformation of midlife in our times and the possibility of real changes in attitudes to ageing--personal and social--under postmodern global capitalism\" (Hepworth 1999, p. 143). \"Gullette's gift for storytelling enthralls readers\" (Achenbaum, 2011, 723). Gullette's chapter, 'Overcoming the Terror of Forgetfulness,' in \"Agewise\" was called \"the best essay on memory loss that I have read. Based partly on the author's experiences with her mother, it reveals her deep compassion and insight\" (Cruikshank 2011, 26).\n\n\"Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America\" (2011) won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Prize. \"Aged by Culture\" (2004), was chosen as a Noteworthy Book of the year by the \"Christian Science Monitor\". It was nominated for a Pulitzer and received an Honorable Mention from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights. \"Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife\" (1997) won the Emily Toth award in 1998 for the best feminist book on American popular culture.\n\nGullette has held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. She held a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute in 1986–87 while finishing \"Safe at Last in the Middle Years\".\n\nHer essay, \"The Contagion of Euphoria,\" won the Daniel Singer Millennial Prize in 2008. Other essays, frequently cited as notable in \"Best American Essays\", have appeared in many literary and cultural quarterlyes, including \"Kenyon Review\", \"Michigan Quarterly Review\", \"American Scholar\", and \"Yale Review\"; and in scholarly journals like \"Feminist Studies\", \"Representations\", \"New Political Science\", \"Profession\", and the \"Journal of the History of Sexuality\". Quotations from her books appear in \"The Quotable Woman: The First Five Thousand Years\" (2010). She is a long-term member of PEN-America, to which she was nominated by Carolyn Heilbrun and Alix Kates Shulman. In 2005 she won the Virginia Liebeler Biennial Grant for Mature Women in Letters from the National League of American Pen Women.\n\nIn 2012 Gullette won the Marigold \"Ideas for Good\" Prize, which carries an award of $5000, for her work as the co-founder and director of development for The Free High School for Adults, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, the sister city of Newton, MA, where she lives. She has been visiting Nicaragua since 1989, finding funding for adult education programs there.\n\nShe married David Gullette, a college classmate, in 1964. They have one child, Sean Leland Sebastian Gullette (born 1968), an actor, screenwriter, and film-director.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "806467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=806467", "title": "Modern philosophy", "text": "Modern philosophy\n\nModern philosophy is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity. It is not a specific doctrine or school (and thus should not be confused with \"Modernism\"), although there are certain assumptions common to much of it, which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.\n\nThe 17th and early 20th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern philosophy. How much of the Renaissance should be included is a matter for dispute; likewise modernity may or may not have ended in the twentieth century and been replaced by postmodernity. How one decides these questions will determine the scope of one's use of \"modern philosophy.\"\n\nHow much of Renaissance intellectual history is part of modern philosophy is disputed: the Early Renaissance is often considered less modern and more medieval compared to the later High Renaissance. By the 17th and 18th centuries the major figures in philosophy of mind, epistemology, and metaphysics were roughly divided into two main groups. The \"Rationalists,\" mostly in France and Germany, argued all knowledge must begin from certain \"innate ideas\" in the mind. Major rationalists were Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, and Nicolas Malebranche. The \"Empiricists,\" by contrast, held that knowledge must begin with sensory experience. Major figures in this line of thought are John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume (These are retrospective categories, for which Kant is largely responsible.) Ethics and political philosophy are usually not subsumed under these categories, though all these philosophers worked in ethics, in their own distinctive styles. Other important figures in political philosophy include Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century Immanuel Kant set forth a groundbreaking philosophical system which claimed to bring unity to rationalism and empiricism. Whether or not he was right, he did not entirely succeed in ending philosophical dispute. Kant sparked a storm of philosophical work in Germany in the early nineteenth century, beginning with German idealism. The characteristic theme of idealism was that the world and the mind equally must be understood according to the same categories; it culminated in the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who among many other things said that \"The real is rational; the rational is real.\"\n\nHegel's work was carried in many directions by his followers and critics. Karl Marx appropriated both Hegel's philosophy of history and the empirical ethics dominant in Britain, transforming Hegel's ideas into a strictly materialist form, setting the grounds for the development of a science of society. Søren Kierkegaard, in contrast, dismissed all systematic philosophy as an inadequate guide to life and meaning. For Kierkegaard, life is meant to be lived, not a mystery to be solved. Arthur Schopenhauer took idealism to the conclusion that the world was nothing but the futile endless interplay of images and desires, and advocated atheism and pessimism. Schopenhauer's ideas were taken up and transformed by Nietzsche, who seized upon their various dismissals of the world to proclaim \"God is dead\" and to reject all systematic philosophy and all striving for a fixed truth transcending the individual. Nietzsche found in this not grounds for pessimism, but the possibility of a new kind of freedom.\n\n19th-century British philosophy came increasingly to be dominated by strands of neo-Hegelian thought, and as a reaction against this, figures such as Bertrand Russell and George Edward Moore began moving in the direction of analytic philosophy, which was essentially an updating of traditional empiricism to accommodate the new developments in logic of the German mathematician Gottlob Frege.\n\nRenaissance humanism emphasized the value of human beings (see Oration on the Dignity of Man) and opposed dogma and scholasticism. This new interest in human activities led to the development of political science with The Prince of Niccolò Macchiavelli. Humanists differed from Medieval scholars also because they saw the natural world as mathematically ordered and pluralistic, instead of thinking of it in terms of purposes and goals. Renaissance philosophy is perhaps best explained by two propositions made by Leonardo da Vinci in his notebooks:\nIn a similar way, Galieo based his scientific method on experiments but also developed mathematical methods for application to problems in physics. These two ways to conceive human knowledge formed the background for the principle of Empiricism and Rationalism respectively.\n\n\nModern philosophy traditionally begins with René Descartes and his dictum \"I think, therefore I am\". In the early seventeenth century the bulk of philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism, written by theologians and drawing upon Plato, Aristotle, and early Church writings. Descartes argued that many predominant Scholastic metaphysical doctrines were meaningless or false. In short, he proposed to begin philosophy from scratch. In his most important work, \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", he attempts just this, over six brief essays. He tries to set aside as much as he possibly can of all his beliefs, to determine what if anything he knows for \"certain\". He finds that he can doubt nearly everything: the reality of physical objects, God, his memories, history, science, even mathematics, but he cannot doubt that he is, in fact, doubting. He knows what he is thinking about, even if it is not true, and he knows that he is there thinking about it. From this basis he builds his knowledge back up again. He finds that some of the ideas he has could not have originated from him alone, but only from God; he proves that God exists. He then demonstrates that God would not allow him to be systematically deceived about everything; in essence, he vindicates ordinary methods of science and reasoning, as fallible but not false.\n\n\nEmpiricism is a theory of knowledge which opposes other theories of knowledge, such as rationalism, idealism and historicism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes (only or primarily) via sensory experience as opposed to rationalism, which asserts that knowledge comes (also) from pure thinking. Both empiricism and rationalism are individualist theories of knowledge, whereas historicism is a social epistemology. While historicism also acknowledges the role of experience, it differs from empiricism by assuming that sensory data cannot be understood without considering the historical and cultural circumstances in which observations are made. Empiricism should not be mixed up with empirical research because different epistemologies should be considered competing views on how best to do studies, and there is near consensus among researchers that studies should be empirical. Today empiricism should therefore be understood as one among competing ideals of getting knowledge or how to do studies. As such empiricism is first and foremost characterized by the ideal to let observational data \"speak for themselves\", while the competing views are opposed to this ideal. The term empiricism should thus not just be understood in relation to how this term has been used in the history of philosophy. It should also be constructed in a way which makes it possible to distinguish empiricism among other epistemological positions in contemporary science and scholarship. In other words: Empiricism as a concept has to be constructed along with other concepts, which together make it possible to make important discriminations between different ideals underlying contemporary science.\n\nEmpiricism is one of several competing views that predominate in the study of human knowledge, known as epistemology. Empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence, especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of innate ideas or tradition in contrast to, for example, rationalism which relies upon reason and can incorporate innate knowledge.\n\n\nPolitical philosophy is the study of such topics as politics, liberty, justice, property, rights, law, and the enforcement of a legal code by authority: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a government legitimate, what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown—if ever. In a vernacular sense, the term \"political philosophy\" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics that does not necessarily belong to the technical discipline of philosophy.\n\n\nIdealism refers to the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally a construct of the mind or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind. An extreme version of this idealism can exist in the philosophical notion of solipsism.\n\n\nExistentialism is generally considered to be the philosophical and cultural movement which holds that the starting point of philosophical thinking must be the individual and the experiences of the individual. Building on that, existentialists hold that moral thinking and scientific thinking together do not suffice to understand human existence, and, therefore, a further set of categories, governed by the norm of \"authenticity\", is necessary to understand human existence.\n\n\nPhenomenology is the study of the structure of experience. It is a broad philosophical movement founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl, expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. The philosophy then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.\n\n\nPragmatism is a philosophical tradition centered on the linking of practice and theory. It describes a process where theory is extracted from practice, and applied back to practice to form what is called \"intelligent practice\". Important positions characteristic of pragmatism include instrumentalism, radical empiricism, verificationism, conceptual relativity, and fallibilism.\nThere is general consensus among pragmatists that philosophy should take the methods and insights of modern science into account.\nCharles Sanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) deserves most of the credit for pragmatism, along with later twentieth century contributors William James and John Dewey.\n\n\nAnalytic philosophy came to dominate English-speaking countries in the 20th century. In the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand, the overwhelming majority of university philosophy departments identify themselves as \"analytic\" departments. The term generally refers to a broad philosophical tradition characterized by an emphasis on clarity and argument (often achieved via modern formal logic and analysis of language) and a respect for the natural sciences.\n\n\nVarious philosophical movements in Asia arose in the modern period including:\n\n\n"}

This stands in stark contrast to other prominent moral theories, such as deontology or utilitarianism. In the former, it is asserted that people have a set of duties (that are to be considered or respected); in the latter, people are to respect the happiness or the preferences of others in their actions. Particularism, to the contrary, asserts that there are no overriding principles that are applicable in every case, or that can be abstracted to apply to every case.\n\nAccording to particularism, most notably defended by Jonathan Dancy, moral knowledge should be understood as knowledge of moral rules of thumb, which are not principles, and of particular solutions, which can be used by analogy in new cases. It ultimately requires that one will be in good faith upon each particular circumstance as opposed to falling under the influence of narcissism. \n\nThe term \"particularism\" was coined to designate this position by R. M.

The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be instantiated, and often in more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept of class by not having any concept of extensionality, and from the philosophical concept of class in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the problem of universals. The terms attribute and quality have similar meanings.\n\nIn modern analytic philosophy there are several debates about the fundamental nature of properties. These center around questions such as: Are properties real? Are they categorical or dispositional? Are properties physical or mental?\nA realist about properties asserts that properties have genuine existence. One way to spell this out is in terms of exact, repeatable, instantiations known universals. The other realist position asserts that properties are particulars(tropes), which are unique instantiations in individual objects that merely resemble one another to various degrees.\n\nThe anti-realist position, often referred to as nominalism claims that properties are names we attach to particulars. The properties themselves have no existence.\n\nAccording to the categoricalist, dispositions reduce to causal bases. The fragility of a wine glass, for example, is not a property that exists in the glass. Rather it can be explained by the categorical property of the glass's micro-structural composition.\n\nDispositionalism, in turn, asserts that a property is nothing more that a set of causal powers. Fragility, according to this view, identifies a real property of the glass (e.g. to shatter when dropped on a sufficiently hard surface).\n\nSeveral intermediary positions exist. The Identity view that states that properties are both categorical(qualitative) and dispositional, they are just two ways of viewing the same property. One hybrid view claims that some properties are categorical and some are dispositional. A second hybrid view claims that properties have both a categorical(qualitative) and dispositional part, but that these are distinct ontological parts.\n\n Property dualism describes a category of positions in the philosophy of mind which hold that, although the world is constituted of just one kind of substance—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: physical properties and mental properties. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical substances (namely brains).\n\nThis stands in contrast to physicalism and idealism. Physicalism claims that all properties, include mental properties, ultimately reduce to, or supervene on, physical properties. Metaphysical Idealism, by contrast, claims that \"something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality.\"\n\nIn classical Aristotelian terminology, a \"property\" (Greek: \"idion\", Latin: \"proprium\") is one of the predicables. It is a non-essential quality of a species (like an accident), but a quality which is nevertheless characteristically present in members of that species. For example, \"ability to laugh\" may be considered a special characteristic of human beings. However, \"laughter\" is not an \"essential\" quality of the species \"human\", whose Aristotelian definition of \"rational animal\" does not require laughter. Therefore, in the classical framework, \"properties\" are characteristic qualities that are not truly required for the continued existence of an entity but are, nevertheless, possessed by the entity.\n\nA property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc. A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific. This distinction may be useful in dealing with issues of identity.\n\nDaniel Dennett distinguishes between \"lovely\" properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they\nrequire an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and \"suspect\" properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime)\n\nThe ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a predicate to a subject. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as Russell's paradox and the Grelling–Nelson paradox. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates \"..weighs more than 1.9 kilos\", \"..weighs more than 1.8 kilos\", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as \"is an individual\", or \"has some properties\" are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called \"Cambridge properties\" as legitimate.\n\nAn intrinsic property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context. An extrinsic (or relational) property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an attribute, since the value of that property is \"given\" to the object via its relation with another object. (See the etymology of the word on Wiktionary.) For example, mass is a physical intrinsic property of any physical object, whereas weight is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed. other examples are the \"name\" of a person (an attribute given by the person's parents) and the weight or mass of the person.\n\nA relation is often considered to be a more general case of a property. Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation \".. is taller than ..\" holds \"between\" two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses ('..'). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.\n\nIt is widely accepted that there are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance \"A is heavier than B\" is a relational \"predicate\", but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations. Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.\n\n\n"}

There are two different versions of the QWB; the original was designed to be administered by an interviewer, and the second development (the QWB-SA) was designed to be self-administered.\n\nThe four domain scores of the questionnaire are combined into a total score that ranges from 0 to 1.0, with 1.0 representing optimum function and 0 representing death.\n\nThe QWB was originally called the Health Status Index, then the Index of Well-Being, and then eventually became the Quality of Well-Being Scale. It has undergone several modifications since its development.\n\nThe process of administering the QWB can be described in three stages. They are the assessment of functional status, scaling the responses and indicating prognosis.\n\nAssessment of functional status involves a structured interview which records the symptoms and problems experienced over the last eight days. It is used to classify the patient’s level of functioning. The interview takes about seven minutes or longer, according to the patient’s level of health. Questions in the interview covered three criteria of functioning: physical activity, social activity and mobility and confinement. The interview also records the presence of symptoms or problem complexes, which are problems that were experienced on the previous day, but were not being experienced at the present time.\n\nThe responses from the interview were then scaled. Preference weights were given for each function level by 867 raters. The preference weights indicated the social judgement of the importance of each function level. A score is generated, which is known as W. W can then be adjusted to reflect the prognosis of a given medical condition.\n\nSince the development of the Quality of Well-Being Scale and the consequent Quality of Well-Being Scale-Self Administered, the questionnaire has been utilized in numerous studies worldwide. Due to the general nature of the questionnaire, it has proven useful in a variety of different formats and contexts.\n\nOne way in which the QWB and the QWB-SA has been utilized is that it has been a comparator used to validate other measures, or a starting point for creating subscales of the questionnaire. An example of this is a subscale developed for use with the QWB-SA that assesses mental health, a comparator study seeking to investigate the Health and Activity Limitation Index and a study seeking to validate a new questionnaire called the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D.\n\nThe QWB and the QWB-SA have also been validated or assessed for suitability in various cultures and countries. The QWB has been assessed for use in Trinidad and Tobago and the QWB-SA has been validated for German patients with prostate disease, as well as Chinese patients with epilepsy.\n\nSelf-perceived quality-of-life scale\n"}

Reclaiming was founded in 1979, in the context of the \"Reclaiming Collective\" (1978–1997), by two Neopagan women of Jewish descent, Starhawk and Diane Baker, in order to explore and develop feminist Neopagan emancipatory rituals.\n\nToday, the organization focuses on progressive social, political, environmental and economic activism. Guided by a shared, \"Principles of Unity, a document that lists the core values of the tradition: personal authority, inclusivity, social and environmental justice and a recognition of intersectionality\".\n\nReclaiming originated in 1979 in the San Francisco Bay Area, blending the influences of Victor and Cora Anderson's Feri Tradition of Witchcraft, Dianic Witchcraft as taught by Z. Budapest, and the feminist, anarchist, peace, and environmental movements.\n\nResearcher Rachel Morgain writes:\nReclaiming's spiritual approach is based in the feminist Goddess movement and matriarchal religion. On some levels Reclaiming has much in common with Wicca, and the Wiccan Charge of the Goddess is commonly utilised; part of it is quoted in Reclaiming's core agenda, known as \"The Principles of Unity\". However, given its focus on dismantling and resisting structures of power and domination, Reclaiming uses consensus process and non-hierarchical structure in its covens – there is no High Priest or High Priestess as there would be in an Alexandrian or Gardnerian witchcraft coven. Reclaiming members are encouraged to take an active part in co-creating group rituals. \n\nTheologically, Reclaiming is very diverse and inclusive. The common thread is an active honoring and defending of the Earth, and a support of the Gaia hypothesis. Teaching and rituals, which are often focused on shamanic techniques such as guided meditation, trance work, shapeshifting and ecstatic dance (as in the Spiral dance, an iconic group dance often performed at rituals and at protest rallies), is empowering the individual and the community to take action. Reclaiming often uses chant as part of its rituals and has released numerous recordings of chants used in the movement. The embodiment of myth and fairytale in dramatic rituals (often done with spontaneity, a quality highly valued in the movement) which enact the cycle of the Seasons or the lessons of particular gods and goddesses are important in Reclaiming.\n\nReclaiming rituals are designed to encourage a spiritual way of life that blends respect for the earth and other livings beings with a fuller sense of personal well-being and alignment with spiritual values. Starhawk and Valentine's handbook \"Twelve Wild Swans\" involves instructions for interpreting the tale of the book's title through both the 'inner' and 'outer' paths of personal and social transformation, the two paths being seen alike as necessary facets of the same overall project. Without a focus on healing the self, Reclaiming members believe people are certain to perpetuate the social ills they have internalised through the damage done by modernity. Their ritual work is thus focused as much on personal healing and transformation as on social justice.\n\nAmong the tradition's teachers are Starhawk, author of \"The Spiral Dance\" and several other books; T. Thorn Coyle, author of \"Evolutionary Witchcraft\"; Diane Baker and Anne Hill, co-authors of \"Circle Round: Raising Children in the Goddess Tradition (1998)\" and M. Macha Nightmare, co-author of \"The Pagan Book of Living and Dying\".\n\nToday, Reclaiming has several dozen affiliated communities across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Weeklong intensives called \"Witchcamps\" bring Reclaiming people together in about a dozen regions. Classes such as \"Elements of Magic\", \"Rites of Passage\", and specific meditative and magical techniques such as the \"Pearl Pentacle\" and the \"Iron Pentacle\" assist participants to share practical skills in personal empowerment and group process. Reclaiming has also produced several CDs of Pagan chants and songs, and publishes the magazine \"Reclaiming Quarterly\".\n\n\n\n"}

There are a number of competing s, each claiming to govern all of Germany.\n\nThe self-described ' (\"Reich citizens\") maintain that the Federal Republic of Germany is illegitimate and that the Reich's 1919 Weimar Constitution remains in effect. Most of their arguments are based on a selective reading of a 1973 decision of the Federal Constitutional Court concerning the Basic Treaty between West and East Germany. The judgement held that the 1949 Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (') itself assumes that the Reich, as a subject of international law, despite the German Instrument of Surrender and the Allied occupation, had survived the collapse of Nazi Germany, but is incapable of acting as a state because it lacks any organization, such as governmental authorities.\n\nThe \" do not, however, cite the Court's further holding that the Federal Republic is not a successor state to the Reich, but, as a West German state at that time partially, and today—since 1990—fully identical to it. Instead they claim to have restored the governmental bodies of the German Reich and to be capable of acting on the basis of the Weimar Constitution.\n\nThe original ' was founded in 1985 by Wolfgang Gerhard Guenter Ebel, a former traffic superintendent in West Berlin. Ebel, who appointed himself Reich Chancellor, claimed to be acting on the authority of the Allied occupation authorities. Some of the members of his \"cabinet\" later fell out with Ebel, and established provisional governments of their own with names such as ' or \"\" (the latter being based in Nevada, USA).\n\ns engage in activities such as issuing currency and stamps, as well as promoting themselves through the Internet and other media. Where the number of their adherents allows, they also emulate the \"re-established\" institutions, such as courts or parliaments, of the Weimar Republic or of earlier German states. A restored ' temporarily existed as well as several Reich Ministers, state governments, and a '.\n\n, German authorities said that membership had grown by 80% over the past two years, more than estimated earlier. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), estimated that there were about 18,000 people who supported the far-right Reichsbürger movement, the largest number of supporters, about 3,500 Reichsbürger members, being in Bavaria. it was also reported that they were trying to build an army.\n\nAs of 2009, there was no reliable count of the number of KRRs then existing, but the \"KRR FAQ\", an online registry maintained by a German jurist, lists some 60 persons or organizations associated with operating competing KRRs. Several (though by no means all) KRRs have links to far-right extremist or neo-Nazi groups, and are under observation by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.\n\nSome KRRs are ready to issue, for a fee, \"official\" documents such as building permits, and driving licences, which their adherents or gullible citizens may attempt to use in everyday life. In one instance, Wolfgang Ebel's KRR issued an \"excavation permit\" to the Principality of Sealand (a micronation), who then had men dig up a plot of land in the Harz region in search of the Amber Room for two weeks, until the landowner hired a private security service to drive them off. Similarly, in 2002 Ebel's KRR \"sold\" the , a manor in Kleinmachnow south of the Berlin city limits that had been owned by the German Reichspost (and therefore, according to Ebel, by his KRR) to one of the two competing governments of Sealand, thus creating, in their view, an enclave of Sealand in Germany.\n\nKRR adherents have also on occasion refused to pay taxes or fines, arguing that the laws providing for such sanctions have no constitutional basis. In the ensuing judicial proceedings, they refuse to recognize the courts as legitimate. Some also pursue their activities abroad. In 2009, after Swiss authorities refused to recognize the \"Reich Driving Licence\" of a German KRR adherent, he unsuccessfully appealed the case up to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland.\n\nWolfgang Ebel's original organization, in particular, continues to attempt enforcing its asserted authority through attempts at intimidation. According to Ebel, his \"government\" has issued more than 1,000 \"arrest warrants\" against people who have disregarded documents issued by the KRR. These warrants inform the addressee that, once the Reich Government is in power, they will be tried for high treason, for which the penalty is death. Ebel has also admitted owning a \"government helicopter\" painted in the national colours, but has denied using it for intimidating fly-overs. Several attempts to prosecute Ebel for threats, impersonating a public servant and so forth have failed because, according to German prosecutors, all courts have found him to be legally insane.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, the \"\" (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution; Germany's federal domestic security agency) estimated the number of people affiliated with the movement at 12,600. The agency has been monitoring the group since November 2016, and the security services of individual states have been monitoring the activities of the group for longer. However, the heterogeneity of the movement, the division into many small groups that are often independent of one another, poses a difficulty for the states and federal government when estimating the number of active \"Reichsbürger\".\n\nOn August 25, 2016, Adrian Ursache, a self-proclaimed \"Reichsbürger\" and former Mister Germany violently resisted the eviction of his house. The original eviction was scheduled for August 24, 2016, with the official justification for the eviction being the liquidity issues of his household. When the German police arrived on scene they encountered a group of around 120 people, who were staying on Ursache’s and his in-law’s property. To Ursache his property was part of the state of \"Ur\", proclaimed by him. After the first eviction attempt failed, the German police returned with a special response team the day after. When the eviction started, Ursache began firing at them, lightly injuring two officers. Ursache was shot and rushed to a hospital. The trial for attempted murder began on October 9, 2017.\n\nOn October 19, 2016, in Georgensgmünd near Nuremberg, a self-described \"Reichsbürger\" fired on a special response unit of the Bavarian Police when they attempted to confiscate his 31 firearms. Three police officers were injured. One of them later died from his injuries.\nThe weapons confiscation followed the revocation of the alleged murderer's firearms permit and his repeated refusal to co-operate with local authorities.\nGerman authorities expressed concern at the escalation in violence. The event attracted international attention.\nBavarian ministers called for increased surveillance of the \"right-wing extremist\" movement. On October 23, 2017, Wolfgang P. was sentenced to imprisonment for life.\n\nThere were renewed calls for more serious measures against the movement, including revocation of firearms permits and seizure of their weapons, following disciplinary action against police officers with alleged connections to the movement. On October 27, 2016, a Bavarian police officer was suspended from his duties because of his connections to one of the \"Reichsbürger\" movements. There have been allegations of similar kind against other police officers in different states of Germany as well.\n\nThe numerous small groups and individuals making up the movement are mainly active in the states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bavaria. According to German authorities, there are a few hundred adherents in Germany, of which 150 to 200 are in Brandenburg. Most \"Reichsbürger\" are male, over 50 and socially disadvantaged; many adhere to right-wing, anti-semitic and Nazi ideologies.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of KRRs that have received media coverage.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26700", "title": "Science", "text": "Science\n\nScience (from Latin \"scientia\", meaning \"knowledge\") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\n\nThe earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to explain events of the physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age. The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy, which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape.\n\nModern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence. Disciplines that utilize existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.\n\nScience is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.\n\nScience in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations. Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results, so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term. Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public works at national scale, such as those which harnessed the floodplain of the Yangtse with reservoirs, dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids. However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. Metallurgy was known in prehistory, and the Vinča culture was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into alchemy.\n\nNeither the words nor the concepts \"science\" and \"nature\" were part of the conceptual landscape in the ancient near east. The ancient Mesopotamians used knowledge about the properties of various natural chemicals for manufacturing pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime plaster, and waterproofing; they also studied animal physiology, anatomy, and behavior for divinatory purposes and made extensive records of the movements of astronomical objects for their study of astrology. The Mesopotamians had intense interest in medicine and the earliest medical prescriptions appear in Sumerian during the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112 BCE – 2004 BCE). Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information and mainly only studied scientific subjects which had obvious practical applications or immediate relevance to their religious system.\n\nIn the classical world, there is no real ancient analog of a modern scientist. Instead, well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time. Before the invention or discovery of the concept of \"nature\" (ancient Greek \"phusis\") by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the \"natural\" \"way\" in which a plant grows, and the \"way\" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason, it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish \"nature\" and \"convention.\" Natural philosophy, the precursor of natural science, was thereby distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was \"philosophy\" – the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek \"technē\") was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans.\n\nThe early Greek philosophers of the Milesian school, which was founded by Thales of Miletus and later continued by his successors Anaximander and Anaximenes, were the first to attempt to explain natural phenomena without relying on the supernatural. The Pythagoreans developed a complex number philosophy and contributed significantly to the development of mathematical science. The theory of atoms was developed by the Greek philosopher Leucippus and his student Democritus. The Greek doctor Hippocrates established the tradition of systematic medical science and is known as \"The Father of Medicine\".\n\nA turning point in the history of early philosophical science was Socrates' example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. The Socratic method as documented by Plato's dialogues is a dialectic method of hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. This was a reaction to the Sophist emphasis on rhetoric. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs. Socrates criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism. Socrates was later, in the words of his \"Apology\", accused of corrupting the youth of Athens because he did \"not believe in the gods the state believes in, but in other new spiritual beings\". Socrates refuted these claims, but was sentenced to death.\n\nAristotle later created a systematic programme of teleological philosophy: Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. In his physics, the Sun goes around the Earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause, a final cause, and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover. The Socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy). Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically \"when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty\".\n\nThe Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos (310–230 BCE) was the first to propose a heliocentric model of the universe, with the Sun at the center and all the planets orbiting it. Aristarchus's model was widely rejected because it was believed to violate the laws of physics. The inventor and mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse made major contributions to the beginnings of calculus and has sometimes been credited as its inventor, although his proto-calculus lacked several defining features. Pliny the Elder was a Roman writer and polymath, who wrote the seminal encyclopedia \"Natural History\", dealing with history, geography, medicine, astronomy, earth science, botany, and zoology.\nOther scientists or proto-scientists in Antiquity were Theophrastus, Euclid, Herophilos, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Galen.\n\nDuring late antiquity, in the Byzantine empire many Greek classical texts were preserved. Many Syriac translations were done by groups such as the Nestorians and Monophysites. They played a role when they translated Greek classical texts into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon. In addition, the neighboring Sassanid Empire established the medical Academy of Gondeshapur where Greek, Syriac and Persian physicians established the most important medical center of the ancient world during the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nBecause of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire due to the Migration Period an intellectual decline took place in the western part of Europe in the 400s. In contrast, the Byzantine Empire resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and preserved and improved upon the learning. John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar in the 500s, was the first scholar ever to question Aristotle's teaching of physics and to note its flaws. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to Galileo Galilei who ten centuries later, during the Scientific Revolution, extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed.\n\nDuring late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Aristotle's four causes prescribed that four \"why\" questions should be answered in order to explain things scientifically. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Western Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science (or \"natural philosophy\" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville. However, Aristotle's original texts were eventually lost in Western Europe, and only one text by Plato was widely known, the \"Timaeus\", which was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few original works of classical natural philosophy, available to Latin readers in the early Middle Ages. Another original work that gained influence in this period was Ptolemy's \"Almagest\", which contains a geocentric description of the solar system.\n\nIn the Byzantine empire, many Greek classical texts were preserved. Many Syriac translations were done by groups such as the Nestorians and Monophysites. They played a role when they translated Greek classical texts into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon.\n\nThe House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq,\nwhere the Islamic study of Aristotelianism flourished. Al-Kindi (801–873) was the first of the Muslim Peripatetic philosophers, and is known for his efforts to introduce Greek and Hellenistic philosophy to the Arab world. The Islamic Golden Age flourished from this time until the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), as well as his predecessor Ibn Sahl, was familiar with Ptolemy's \"Optics\", and used experiments as a means to gain knowledge. Furthermore, doctors and alchemists such as the Persians Avicenna and Al-Razi also greatly developed the science of Medicine with the former writing the Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia used until the 18th century and the latter discovering multiple compounds like alcohol. Avicenna's canon is considered to be one of the most important publications in medicine and they both contributed significantly to the practice of experimental medicine, using clinical trials and experiments to back their claims.\n\nIn Classical antiquity, Greek and Roman taboos had meant that dissection was usually banned in ancient times, but in Middle Ages it changed: medical teachers and students at Bologna began to open human bodies, and Mondino de Luzzi (c. 1275–1326) produced the ﬁrst known anatomy textbook based on human dissection.\n\nBy the eleventh century most of Europe had become Christian; stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population. In addition, classical Greek texts started to be translated from Arabic and Greek into Latin, giving a higher level of scientific discussion in Western Europe.\n\nBy 1088, the first university in Europe (the University of Bologna) had emerged from its clerical beginnings. Demand for Latin translations grew (for example, from the Toledo School of Translators); western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. Manuscript copies of Alhazen's \"Book of Optics\" also propagated across Europe before 1240, as evidenced by its incorporation into Vitello's \"Perspectiva\". Avicenna's Canon was translated into Latin. In particular, the texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Euclid, preserved in the Houses of Wisdom and also in the Byzantine Empire, were sought amongst Catholic scholars. The influx of ancient texts caused the Renaissance of the 12th century and the flourishing of a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism in western Europe, which became a new geographic center of science. An \"experiment\" in this period would be understood as a careful process of observing, describing, and classifying. One prominent scientist in this era was Roger Bacon. Scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation and dialectic reasoning, and gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries, as alchemy's focus on experiments that include direct observation and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance.\n\nAlhazen disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision, but did not make any corresponding changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, teleology and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly came to realize that the universe itself might well be devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. The development from a physics infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward a physics where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries. This development was enhanced by the Condemnations of 1277, where Aristotle's books were banned by the Catholic church. This allowed the theoretical possibility of vacuum and motion in a vacuum. A direct result was the emergence of the science of dynamics.\n\nNew developments in optics played a role in the inception of the Renaissance, both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on perception, as well as by contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the camera obscura and the telescope. Before what we now know as the Renaissance started, Roger Bacon, Vitello, and John Peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle. A model of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance. This theory utilizes only three of Aristotle's four causes: formal, material, and final.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy's \"Almagest\". This was based on a theorem that the orbital periods of the planets are longer as their orbs are farther from the centre of motion, which he found not to agree with Ptolemy's model.\n\nKepler and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is perception, and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the propagation of light. Kepler modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil. He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye. Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics, and described his work as a search for the Harmony of the Spheres.\nGalileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\", which greatly offended Urban VIII.\n\nIn Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of \"simple\" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or \"formal cause\", of each complex type of thing. This new science began to see itself as describing \"laws of nature\". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.\n\nAs a precursor to the Age of Enlightenment, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as classical mechanics, which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, \"energy\" and \"potential\" (modern versions of Aristotelian \"\"energeia\" and \"potentia\"\"). This implied a shift in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals. In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word \"science\" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a \"type of pursuit\" of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature – coming close in meaning to the old term \"natural philosophy.\"\n\nDuring this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and inventions that would improve human lives, in the materialistic sense of having more food, clothing, and other things. In Bacon's words, \"the real and legitimate goal of sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions and riches\", and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible philosophical or spiritual ideas, which he believed contributed little to human happiness beyond \"the fume of subtle, sublime, or pleasing speculation\".\n\nScience during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the \"Encyclopédie\" and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's \"Principia\".\n\nSome historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.\n\nEnlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors – Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally – as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.\n\nThe nineteenth century is a particularly important period in the history of science since during this era many distinguishing characteristics of contemporary modern science began to take shape such as: transformation of the life and physical sciences, frequent use of precision instruments, emergence of terms like \"biologist\", \"physicist\", \"scientist\"; slowly moving away from antiquated labels like \"natural philosophy\" and \"natural history\", increased professionalization of those studying nature lead to reduction in amateur naturalists, scientists gained cultural authority over many dimensions of society, economic expansion and industrialization of numerous countries, thriving of popular science writings and emergence of science journals.\n\nEarly in the 19th century, John Dalton suggested the modern atomic theory, based on Democritus's original idea of individible particles called \"atoms\".\n\nBoth John Herschel and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist. When Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" he established evolution as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity. His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later.\n\nThe laws of conservation of energy, conservation of momentum and conservation of mass suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources. With the advent of the steam engine and the industrial revolution, there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined by Newton were not equally useful; they did not have the same energy quality. This realization led to the development of the laws of thermodynamics, in which the cumulative energy quality of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the entropy of the universe increases over time.\n\nThe electromagnetic theory was also established in the 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron.\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.\n\nIn the first half of the century, the development of antibiotics and artificial fertilizer made global human population growth possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of \"atomic energy\" (nuclear power). In addition, the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), the development of ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear arms race.\n\nThe molecular structure of DNA was discovered in 1953. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 led to a rejection of the Steady State theory of the universe in favour of the Big Bang theory of Georges Lemaître.\n\nThe development of spaceflight in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space, including manned landings on the Moon. Space telescopes lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.\n\nWidespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including smartphones. The need for mass systematization of long, intertwined causal chains and large amounts of data led to the rise of the fields of systems theory and computer-assisted scientific modelling, which are partly based on the Aristotelian paradigm.\n\nHarmful environmental issues such as ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication and climate change came to the public's attention in the same period, and caused the onset of environmental science and environmental technology. In a 1967 article, Lynn Townsend White Jr. blamed the ecological crisis on the historical decline of the notion of spirit in nature.\n\nWith the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the last particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics was found. In 2015, gravitational waves, predicted by general relativity a century before, were first observed.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was completed in 2003, determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome. Induced pluripotent stem cells were developed in 2006, a technology allowing adult cells to be transformed into stem cells capable of giving rise to any cell type found in the body, potentially of huge importance to the field of regenerative medicine.\n\nModern science is commonly divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, social sciences, and formal sciences. Each of these branches comprise various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise. Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences as their knowledge are based on empirical observations and are capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.\n\nThere are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine.\n\nNatural science is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. It can be divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science) and physical science. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science. Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on. Today, \"natural history\" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.\n\nSocial science is concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology, public health, and sociology. Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society. For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term \"social research\" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.\n\nFormal science is involved in the study of formal systems. It includes mathematics, systems theory, robotics, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts. The formal sciences are therefore \"a priori\" disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science. Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics. Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics.\n\nScientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question \"what is the \"use\" of basic research?\" he responded: \"Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?\". For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.\n\nScientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way. An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as \"Occam's Razor\") and are generally expected to seek consilience – fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena. This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress. This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).\n\nWhen a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded. If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.\n\nWhile performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias. This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions. After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be. Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).\n\nMathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws in the natural and social sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements. Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.\n\nComputational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.\n\nJohn Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge. Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as \"perceptual consensibility.\" He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.\n\nScientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation. Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.\n\nThe belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality. In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.\n\nThere are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism, which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations. Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method.\nEmpiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation. Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it. Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method. Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error. It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.\n\nAnother approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed \"shut up and multiply,\" emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena. It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.\n\nThomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent \"portrait\" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized \"normal science\" as the process of observation and \"puzzle solving\" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas \"revolutionary science\" occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more \"portraits\" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism.\n\nFinally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like \"creation science\" is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations. That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena. The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.\n\nA scientific theory is empirical and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism. The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge \"consists in the search for truth,\" but it \"is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.\"\n\nNew scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like \"breakthrough\" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false. While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap. Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community. For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name \"theory\" even though, in practice, they are considered factual.\nPhilosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for \"knowledge\" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the \"possibility\" that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth. The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless – but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense. He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.\n\nStanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a \"magic bullet\"; it avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely \"What is \"the\" cause of ...\", but rather \"What \"are\" the most significant \"causes\" of ...\". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, physical cosmology). Research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider. For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.\n\nAn area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science. Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term \"cargo cult science\" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the \"kind of utter honesty\" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated. Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.\n\nThere can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as \"bad science,\" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term \"scientific misconduct\" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.\n\nScientific research is published in an enormous range of scientific literature. Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, \"Journal des Sçavans\" followed by the \"Philosophical Transactions\", began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500. The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.\n\nMost scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.\n\nScience magazines such as \"New Scientist\", \"Science & Vie\", and \"Scientific American\" cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.\n\nRecent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the \"Creative Writing Science\" resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.\n\nDiscoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing. For example:\n\nThe scientific community is a group of all interacting scientists, along with their respective societies and institutions.\n\nScientists are individuals who conduct scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest. The term \"scientist\" was coined by William Whewell in 1833. In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Doctor of Medicine (MD), or Doctor of Engineering (DEng). Many scientists pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.\n\nScientists exhibit a strong curiosity about reality, with some scientists having a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of health, nations, environment, or industries. Other motivations include recognition by their peers and prestige. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award, is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics. \n\nScience has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions. Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work. For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to enter a PhD program as \"C. Ladd\"; Christine \"Kitty\" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.\n\nIn the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men. Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically. In the early part of the 21st century, women in the United States earned 50.3% of bachelor's degrees, 45.6% of master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields. They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology (about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50-60%) but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues, and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged.\n\nLearned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance. Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines. Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualifications, or may be an honor conferred by election. Membership often requires possession of some scientific credentials, or may be an honor conferred by election. Most scientific societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the sociology of science argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.\n\nThe professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the Italian in 1603, the British Royal Society in 1660, the French in 1666, the American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.\n\nScience policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.\n\nState policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire. Prominent historical examples include the Great Wall of China, completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of several dynasties, and the Grand Canal of the Yangtze River, an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by Sunshu Ao (孫叔敖 7th c. BCE), Ximen Bao (西門豹 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the Warring States period.\n\nPublic policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that \"Science is a proper concern of government.\"\n\nScientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP. In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, in France, the Max Planck Society and in Germany, and CSIC in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than \"blue-sky\" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).\n\nThe public awareness of science relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication, science museums, science festivals, science fairs, citizen science, and science in popular culture. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.\n\nThe mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.\n\nPoliticization of science occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, postmodernist subjectivism, and fear for business interests. Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence. Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence. Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the global warming controversy, health effects of pesticides, and health effects of tobacco.\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nResources\n"}

The original 1944 English translation by Walter Lowrie (now out of print), had the title The Concept of Dread. \"The Concept of Anxiety\" was dedicated \"to the late professor Poul Martin Møller\". He used the pseudonym Vigilius Haufniensis (which, according to Kierkegaard scholar Josiah Thompson, is the Latin transcription for \"the Watchman\" of Copenhagen) for \"The Concept of Anxiety\".\n\nAll of Kierkegaard's books have either a preface, dedication, or prayer at the beginning. This book includes a lengthy introduction. \"The Concept of Anxiety\" was published on exactly the same date as \"Prefaces\", June 17, 1844. Both books deal with Hegel’s idea of mediation. Mediation is a common thread throughout Kierkegaard’s works. His work up to this point was to show that faith was being mediated by knowledge. Here he takes up the questions of sin and guilt.\n\nFor Kierkegaard, anxiety/dread/angst is unfocused fear. Kierkegaard uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. When the man looks over the edge, he experiences a focused fear of falling, but at the same time, the man feels a terrifying impulse to throw himself intentionally off the edge. That experience is anxiety or dread because of our complete freedom to choose to either throw oneself off or to stay put. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Kierkegaard called this our \"dizziness of freedom.\"\n\nKierkegaard focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: Adam's choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was \"evil.\" What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin. Kierkegaard mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin (which Augustine was the first to call \"peccatum originale\", \"original sin\").\n\nHowever, Kierkegaard mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflective consciousness and reflective consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of anxiety. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms. Alternatively, sin exists in the very resolution of anxiety through right and wrong; why to embrace anxiety is to not pass judgement.\n\nIn 1793, forty-one years before Kierkegaard wrote \"The Concept of Anxiety\", Immanuel Kant wrote his book \"Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone\"; his book elevated reason in the realm of Christianity. Many continental philosophers wrote their books in relation to Kant's ideas. Kierkegaard was familiar with \"Book Two\" of Kant's book \"The Conflict of the Good with the Evil Principle for Sovereignty over Man\" and he made a similar study in this book; however, he might call it the conflict of ethics and anxiety for sovereignty over man. Kierkegaard would replace Kant's term \"Good\" with \"Ethics\" and his term \"Evil\" with \"Anxiety about the Good\". He wrote about the ideal good versus the actual good that a single individual can do in the following way: \"Ethics proposes to bring ideality into actuality. On the other hand, it is not the nature of its movement to raise actuality up into ideality. Ethics points to ideality as a task and assumes that every man possesses the requisite conditions. Thus ethics develops a contradiction, inasmuch as it makes clear both the difficulty and the impossibility.\" He was wondering how any existing human being can make any movement in an ideal world.\n\nKierkegaard begins this book with a short preface. By now he expects his readers to be aware that the preface is a key to the meaning of the book. Haufniensis uses the word \"generation' several times as well as \"epoch\" and \"era\" in his introduction to prepare the reader for his subject. Progress from the \"first science\", ethics, to the \"second science\", psychology. Historians, psychologists, anthropologists, theologians and philosophers were all in agreement that the past must be preserved if there is to be a future for humankind. These soft sciences were of interest to Kierkegaard only in so far as they related to the progress of Christianity. His preface is followed by his first introduction since he published his thesis, \"The Concept of Irony\". It could mark a new beginning but that is not known for certain.\n\nFriedrich Schelling wrote \"Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom\" in 1809, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel wrote his \"Science of Logic\" between 1812 and 1816, and Johann Friedrich Herbart<nowiki> </nowiki> wrote about pedagogy. All of them were discussing how good and evil come into existence. Kierkegaard questioned Hegel and Schelling's emphasis on the negative (evil) and aligned himself with Hebart's emphasis on the positive (good). Kierkegaard says \"anxiety about sin produces sin\" in this book and later says it again: \n\nAll of them were involved with the dialectical question of exactly \"how\" an individual, or group, or race changes from good to evil or evil to good. Kierkegaard pressed forward with his category of \"the single individual.\" Kierkegaard's Introduction is in Primary sources below.\n Many men and women are anxious about whom they should marry and how they will pick the right person. The anxious person stands at the crossroads and wonders which way to go. Kierkegaard captured the sentiment in his book \"Either/Or\", which is filled with examples of people at the crossroads. Johann Goethe (1749–1832) was at a crossroads and couldn't make up his mind about what he wanted so he talked to the devil about it in his play \"Faust\". Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850) wrote a book about a single individual wanting to get married in his book \"Aladdin\". He let a genie make up his mind for him. Kierkegaard points out that Isaac didn't have freedom to choose his wife either. He wrote: Isaac presumably dared with a certain degree of assurance to expect that God would surely choose a wife for him who was young and beautiful and highly regarded by the people and lovable in every way, but nevertheless we lack the erotic, even if it was the case that he loved this one chosen of God with all the passion of youth. Freedom was lacking. \"Either/Or II\", Hong p 44 Isaac had expectations, but he didn't have an easy time just because God made his choice for him. Both freedom and anxiety were absent in these examples of three personal choices but ignorance was present because none of them were personally involved in a very important decision.\n\nNeither Goethe nor Oehlenschlager tells the reader if Faust or Alladin was faithful to the one chosen for him, they just end the story. But Isaac's story continued and showed that he was faithful to the choice made for him. Kierkegaard questions how a person can remain faithful to a choice that is made by others? The others are external powers whereas his spirit is an internal power. All three stories deal with the world of the spirit. Kierkegaard thinks the \"spirit is a hostile and a friendly power at the same time\". He wrote: \"That anxiety makes its appearance is pivotal. Man is a synthesis of the psychical and the physical; however, a synthesis is unthinkable if the two are not united in a third. This third is spirit. In innocence, man is not merely animal, for if he were at any moment of his life merely animal, he would never become man. So spirit is present, but is immediate, as dreaming. It is in a sense a hostile power, for it constantly disturbs the relation between soul and body, a relation that indeed has persistence and yet does not have endurance, inasmuch as it first receives the latter by the spirit. On the other hand, spirit is a friendly power, since it is precisely that which constitutes the relation. What, then, is man’s relation to this ambiguous power? How does spirit relate itself to itself and to its conditionality? It relates itself as anxiety. Do away with itself, the spirit cannot; lay hold of itself, it cannot, as long as it has itself outside itself. Nor can man sink down into the vegetative, for he is qualified as spirit; flee away from anxiety, he cannot, for he loves it; really love it, he cannot, for he flees from it. Innocence has now reached its uttermost point. It is ignorance; however, it is not an animal brutality but an ignorance qualified as spirit, and as such innocence is precisely anxiety, because its ignorance is about nothing. Here there is no knowledge of good and evil etc., but the whole actuality of knowledge projects itself in anxiety as the enormous nothing of ignorance. \"The Concept of Anxiety\", p. 43–44\n\nThis \"ambiguous power\" is discussed further in Kierkegaard's 1847 book \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\" and his 1848 book \"Christian Discourses\" where he finds himself standing against his own best intentions. \n\nKierkegaard was interested in how an individual can keep faith awake and hope alive. \n\nThe Brothers Grimm were writing about the use of folktales as educational stories to keep individuals from falling into evil hands. Kierkegaard refers to \"The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was\" in \"The Concept of Anxiety\" (p. 155). Can the \"power of the example\", or theatre pedagogy, or the theatre of the absurd, help an individual learn how to find the good? Danish folklore was at this time also coming to the attention of pedagogs. Imagination can be of assistance but it can also keep an individual from making crucial decisions. But failing to \"become honest with yourself so that you do not deceive yourself with imagined power, with which you experience imagined victory in imagined struggle\" is how a decision can become an impossibility.\n\nWhat's keeping him from making the decision? Nothing except the imagination of the individual involved in making the decision, imaginations of guilt and sin and fear and rejection. In \"Fear and Trembling\" Abraham had to choose to follow God or call him a monster. In \"Repetition\" the Young Man had to choose to get married or to follow his love of writing. Both were \"imaginative constructions\" created by Kierkegaard that dealt with hope and love.\n\nKierkegaard felt that imaginative constructions should be upbuilding. Kierkegaard wrote about \"the nothing of despair\", God as the unknown is nothing, and death is a nothing. Goethe's \"Der Erlkönig\" and \"The Bride of Corinth\" (1797) are also nothing. The single individual has a reality which fiction can never represent. People should learn the difference between imaginary constructions and reality. Many things are hard to understand but Kierkegaard says, \"Where understanding despairs, faith is already present in order to make the despair properly decisive.\" \n\nKierkegaard is not concerned with what Eve's sin was, he says it wasn't sensuousness, but he is concerned with how Eve learned that she was a sinner. He says \"consciousness presupposes itself. Eve became conscious of her first sin through her choice and Adam became conscious of his first sin through his choice. God's gift to Adam and Eve was the \"knowledge of freedom\" and they both decided to use it. In Kierkegaard's Journals he said, \"the one thing needful\" for the doctrine of Atonement to make sense was the \"anguished conscience.\" He wrote, \"Remove the anguished conscience, and you may as well close the churches and turn them into dance halls.\"\n\nKierkegaard says, every person has to find out for him or her self how guilt and sin came into their worlds. Kierkegaard argued about this in both \"Repetition\" and \"Fear and Trembling\" where he said philosophy must not define faith. He asks his reader, the single individual, to consider some questions. Can sin and guilt be transferred from one person to another? Is it \"an epidemic that spreads like cowpox\"? Was every Jewish person responsible for the crucifixion of Christ? Does the single individual find sin in others or in him or herself? He believed in a rigorous self-inspection and at the same time a lenient inspection of others. He put it this way in \"Four Upbuilding Discourses of 1844\": \n\nWhat was the intention of Christianity? Does the concept emerge through definitions and examples? Sin and guilt are both religious categories as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. He wrote:\nKierkegaard observes that it was the prohibition itself not to eat of the tree of knowledge that gave birth to sin in Adam. The prohibition predisposes that which breaks forth in Adam's qualitative leap. He questions the doctrine of Original Sin, also called Ancestral sin., \"The doctrine that Adam and Christ correspond to each other confuses things. Christ alone is an individual who is more than an individual. For this reason he does not come in the beginning but in the fullness of time.\" Sin has a \"coherence in itself\".\n\nIn \"Philosophical Fragments\" Kierkegaard described the Learner in Error before God. Here he questions how the Learner discovers this Error. New sciences were emerging that challenged the conventional ethics of the time as well as the notions of guilt and sin. Kierkegaard described the struggle elegantly. He says, \"Ethics and dogmatics struggle over reconciliation in a border area fraught with fate. Repentance and guilt torment forth reconciliation ethically, while dogmatics in this receptivity to the proffered reconciliation, has the historically concrete immediacy with which it begins its discourse in the great dialogue of science. And now what will be the result?\" and \"Innocence is ignorance, but how is it lost?\" The Concept of Anxiety\" P. 12, 39\n\nKierkegaard also writes about an individual's disposition in \"The Concept of Anxiety\". He was impressed with the psychological views of Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz who wrote: \n\nWe are all predisposed to certain actions, some good some evil. Are these habits or sins? \"How does a person learn earnestness?\" Kierkegaard and Rosenkranz thought it was a good idea for a person to find out about their own dispositions so he or she can live a happier life. \n\nKierkegaard believed \"each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations\". In an earlier book he had said, \"to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning\", and in another, \"no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning\", \"no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one. He was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a \"third term\" that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard is essentially asking if the teaching of a child begins with the prohibition or with love. In other words, does Christianity say to first teach about \"the works of the flesh\" (the negative) or about the \"Fruit of the Holy Spirit\" (the positive)? Does the answer lie in the world of the spirit or in the world of temporality? Should we always go backwards to review the negative or forward because we are concentrating on the positive. Or should there be a balance between the two? And he just puts the question out there as part of the \"great dialogue of science\" for consideration. He began this discussion in his \"Two Upbuilding Discourses of 1843\" in \"Galatians\" chapter 3 (\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\").\n\nKierkegaard is wondering if one generation can learn wonder, love, anxiety, peace, patience, hope, from a previous generation or if each \"single individual\" in each generation must learn these things, for the most part, on their own. He asked the same question in Philosophical Fragments about how someone learns to become a Christian. Are we Christian because of our family and personal history or because we have made a \"decisive resolution\"? What kind of goods is the Christian looking to gain? Isn't hope a good and despair an evil in yourself that you work to change into the good called hope? Isn't patience a good and impatience an evil that can be changed if you want to change it? Isn't your soul a good? Is the soul given to the chosen few or is it given as a free gift to all, without merit? Is our future a matter of fate, of choice, or a combination of both? Kierkegaard answers this way: \n\nKierkegaard repeats the synthesis again in \"The Sickness Unto Death\" and he tied it to his idea of the \"Moment\" from \"Philosophical Fragments\". He says, \"For the Greeks, the eternal lies behind as the past that can only be entered backwards. The category I maintain should be kept in mind, repetition, by which eternity is entered forwards.\" Kierkegaard wrote \"Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits\" in 1847. He said, \"A Providence watches over each man’s wandering through life. It provides him with two guides. The one calls him forward. The other calls him back. They are, however, not in opposition to each other, these two guides, nor do they leave the wanderer standing there in doubt, confused by the double call. Rather the two are in eternal understanding with each other. For the one beckons forward to the Good, the other calls man back from evil. These guides are called repentance and remorse. The eager traveler hurries forward to the new, to the novel, and, indeed, away from experience. But the remorseful one, who comes behind, laboriously gathers up experience. Kierkegaard also mentions this idea in his Journals. He wrote: \"It is quite true what philosophy says; that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other principle: that it must be lived forwards. Which principle, the more one thinks it through, ends exactly with the thought that temporal life can never properly be understood precisely because I can at no instant find complete rest in which to adopt a position: backwards.\n\nThe English poet Christina Rossetti said the same thing in her poem Advent: \"The days are evil looking back, The coming days are dim; Yet count we not His promise slack, But watch and wait for Him.\" If we want to look back to the age of Constantine The Great and start there in our search for Christianity we will go forward and think that an emperor can create millions of Christians by edict. Constantin Constantius wanted to do that in \"Repetition\". Goethe wanted to start with the black plague in \"Faust\" or with the Lisbon earthquake in his autobiography. These are negative beginnings. Both Rossetti and Kierkegaard take this present age as a starting point. Now the single individual interested in becoming a Christian can go forward toward a goal without continually looking over the shoulder.\n\nHegel looks at eternity as an unfolding, or a transition, from stage to stage, from the Persian, to the Syrian, to the Egyptian religion as Object, Good. Kierkegaard didn't want to be double-minded about the good, and, after his own fashion, created his own system of good in 1847 in \"Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits\". He brought eternity into relation with his own feelings of guilt in relation to Regine Olsen, his fiancé, in \"Stages on Life's Way\" (1845) because he had so much anxiety about disclosing his inner being to her, it was \"terrifying\". However, early on, Kierkegaard had written about moving forward in regard to himself, Regine, and any other single individual. He wrote the following in 1843 and 1845. \n\nWalter Lowrie translated \"The Concept of Dread\" in 1944. He was asked \"almost petulantly\" why it took him so long to translate the book. Alexander Dru had been working on the book and Charles Williams hoped the book would be published along with \"The Sickness Unto Death\", which Lowrie was working on in 1939. Then the war started and Dru was wounded and gave the job over to Lowrie. Lowrie could find \"no adequate word to use for \"Angst\". Lee Hollander had used the word dread in 1924, a Spanish translator used \"angustia\", and Miguel Unamuno, writing in French used \"agonie\" while other French translators used \"angoisse\". Rollo May quoted Kierkegaard in his book \"Meaning of Anxiety\", which is the relation between anxiety and freedom. \n\nThe book seems to be highly interpretive in its title. Is it dread, anxiety, angst, or sin? Or is the final word of the title something else. It's up to the individual reader to determine that. If the single individual can't make a choice as to the meaning of a word then all choice has been taken away from the individual. Lowrie decided the book deals with \"an apprehension of the future, a presentiment of a something which is a nothing\" which must be fought against. But fought on the inside with oneself about what \"you\" as the single individual can become. Professor Lorraine Clark put it this way in 1991, \"Existence is not just a given but also a \"task\", Kierkegaard insists-the task of \"becoming\" oneself; for \"actuality (the historical actuality) relates itself in a two-fold way to the subject: partly as a gift which will not admit of being rejected, and partly as a task to be realized\" (\"Concept of Irony\", Hong p. 293). One cannot become all possibilities simultaneously in reality (however possible this may be in thought, as he readily acknowledges); one must become some one thing in particular. Otherwise, one remains abstract.\" And Lee Hollander writes of what he perceived as Kierkegaard's problem which could also be every individual's problem. In previous works Kierkegaard had already intimated that what furnished man the impetus to rise into the highest sphere and to assail passionately and incessantly the barrier of the paradox, or else caused him to lapse into \"demonic despair,\" was the consciousness of sin. In the book \"Begrebet Angest\" The Concept of Sin, he now attempts with an infinite and laborious subtlety to explain the nature of sin. Its origin is found in the \"sympathetic antipathy\" of Dread -that force which at one and the same time attracts and repels from the suspected danger of a fall and is present even in the state of innocence, in children. It finally results in a kind of \"dizziness\" which is fatal. Yet, so Kierkegaard contends, the \"fall\" of man is, in every single instance, due to a definite act of the will, a \"leap\" – which seems a patent contradiction. To the modern reader, this is the least palatable of Kierkegaard's works, conceived as it is with a sovereign and almost medieval disregard of the predisposing undeniable factors of environment and heredity (which, to be sure, poorly fit his notion of the absolute responsibility of the individual). Its somberness is redeemed, to a certain degree, by a series of marvelous observations, drawn from history and literature, on the various phases and manifestations of Dread in human life. \"Selections from the writings of Kierkegaard\", Translated by L. M. Hollander 1923 p. 27-28\n\nRobert Harold Bonthius discusses Kierkegaard's idea of dread in his 1948 book \"Christian Paths to Self-Acceptance\", \"Because the original Reformation and the subsequent Protestant scholastic doctrines of man’s depravity are distorted by literal ism, we will turn to those in our day who have revived Reformation thought, the so-called neo-orthodox theologians, for explanation of this profound view of sin and its importance for true self-acceptance. It is important to bear in mind, however, that man’s sinfulness is still conceived of the preached about in the undialectical forms of the past. Especially is this characteristic of flourishing sectarian bodies here in America-groups which are able to number their adherents in tens of thousands. It is Soren Kierkegaard of Denmark who has provided the key to modern reinterpretation of this austere doctrine of sin with his analysis of the relation of sin to anxiety. \"Dread or anxiety,\" he explained \"is the psychological condition which precedes sin, comes as near as possible to it, and is as provocative as possible of dread, but without explaining sin, which breaks forth first in the qualitative leap.\" Kierkegaard saw this \"sickness unto death\" as the inherent factor in human existence, and he taught that a \"synthesis\" was needed, by which he meant a vital relationship of man with God by which man may resolve his inner conflicts and live at peace with himself.\"\n\nHunt, George Laird interpreted Kierkegaard's writing as basically asking \"How can we understand ourselves?\" He wrote the following in 1958: What makes man human? Although Kierkegaard does not emphasize the word, he thinks of man in terms of his creatureliness. Man's creatureliness lies in the fact that he stands between life and death. Made in the image of God, he knows what it means to feel the presence of eternity. Feeling the nearness of eternity, utterly dependent upon it for his meaning, he also knows that he dies, and that he cannot escape death. These two factors constitute both his problem and his possibility of for immortality, creates his anguish or his \"nervous humanness\". Man sins in that he is unwilling to live in faith and therefore to be nervously human. He prefers to live either with life or with death but not with both. He seeks to escape creatureliness either by pretending that he will not die or by assuming that there is no eternity. He refuses to bear uncertainty and anguish. Either he turns his back on death by pretending that immortality is automatically a part of all life or he tries to forget his anguish by becoming an animal. It is precisely this anguish, this willingness to live neither as an animal (unaware of eternity) nor as an angel (indifferent to death), which marks the humanness from which we fall when we sin. It is also this greatness. Knowing mortality, even while he hungers humanness, this willingness to risk death as we trust God, which signals the beginning of our redemption. \"Ten makers of modern Protestant thought Schweitzer, Rauschenbusch, Temple, Kierkegaard, Barth, Brunner, Niebuhr, Tillich, Bultmann, Buber\" p. 55-56\n\nWalter Kaufmann discussed the existentialism of Sartre and Kierkegaard in his 1960 lecture \"Kierkegaard and the Crisis in Religion\".

{"id": "32578637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32578637", "title": "The Nature of Mind", "text": "The Nature of Mind\n\n\"The Nature of Mind\" is a philosophical essay by David Armstrong, originally published in \"The Nature of Mind and Other Essays\" in 1980. In this essay, Armstrong outlines a philosophical account of the mind that is compatible with the Materialist scientific view of the mind. He arrives at a theory of Central-State Materialism, a synthesis between Descartes' dualism (the thesis) and Gilbert Ryle's dispositional behaviourism (the antithesis).\n\nThe essay begins with the simple assertion that \"men have minds\", and Armstrong suggests that modern science may be the best tool with which to investigate the nature of the mind. He says that it seems that scientific consensus is converging on an explanation of the mind in \"purely physico-chemical terms\". He acknowledges some disagreement on the matter, but says that dissent tends to be on primarily non-scientific grounds. Armstrong writes that the purpose of his essay is to outline a Materialist account of the nature of the mind - one that is compatible with the scientific view of an entirely physico-chemical mind.\n\nArmstrong states that science can achieve consensus among experts on controversial matters after prolonged investigation. This, he says, makes science the authority on the nature of the mind and other matters. It is recognized that science can make mistakes, and that some claim that science has a limited sphere of inquiry. He puts forward science as the best hope we have in understanding the mind.\n\nReturning to the search for a Materialist account of the mind, Armstrong considers Behaviourism, which holds that the mind \"is not something behind the behaviour of the body, it [is] simply part of that physical behaviour\". While Behaviourism fits nicely with a Materialist view of the mind, it has significant flaws - it is possible to feel or think something without acting on this feeling or thought. For instance, one can feel angry but not express anger. \n\nArmstrong looks at Gilbert Ryle's refinement of Behaviourism, Dispositional Behaviourism. Armstrong illustrates Ryle's idea with a description of glass - brittleness is the disposition of materials such as glass to shatter under certain circumstances. Whether or not the glass shatters in a particular instance, it has the disposition to do so. In the same way, a mind can have a disposition towards anger, but it may only express this anger under certain circumstances. Armstrong quotes Ryle's \"The Concept of Mind\": \nWhile this dispositionalism quite successfully deals with the objection that one can feel or think one thing and do another, it is not enough - \"it seems obvious as anything is obvious that there is something actually going on in me that constitutes my thought\". Ryle's Dispositional Behaviourism denies this, and so Armstrong declares it to be \"unsatisfactory as a theory of mind\". Though he rejects Behaviourism, Armstrong suggests that it is useful to say that the mind and mental states are \"logically tied to behaviour\". He says that \"thought is not speech under suitable circumstances, rather it is something within the person that, in suitable circumstances, brings about speech.\" He thinks this view is compatible with a Materialist view of the mind, though it is also compatible with non-Materialist views, such as Descartes'.\n\nArmstrong modifies Ryle's Behaviourism by suggesting that the mind's dispositions may be explainable by science in Materialist terms, in the same way that glass's brittleness can be explained in terms of molecular structure. Armstrong offers this view as a true account of the mind. It is more fully developed in \"Belief, Truth and Knowledge\" (1973), ch. 2, sect. 2.\n\nArmstrong brings together two earlier conclusions: that the mind is \"that which stands behind and brings about our complex behaviour\"; and that the Behaviourist's dispositions are \"states that underlie behaviour and, under certain circumstances, bring about behaviour\", and reaches \"a conception of a mental state as a state of the person apt for producing certain ranges of behaviour\".\n\nArmstrong now addresses what he calls 'the problem of consciousness': how can the personal experience of consciousness be explained by his Materialist theory of the mind? Armstrong considers times when the brain goes on 'auto-pilot' - during long drives without breaks, one might suddenly 'come to' and realize that while one has stayed on the road, stopped at red lights and operated the clutch, one was completely unaware of doing so. This shows that it is possible for mental processes to take place without conscious experience.\n\nBefore considering how this can be the case, Armstrong describes a method by which a psychologist may determine whether an animal can distinguish between two colours by training it to perform a task that requires this perception. The animal's behaviour would indicate its perception of the colours. While a Behaviourist would say that the animal's behaviour \"was\" its perception, Armstrong describes the perception as a state of the animal's mind. It is implied that one could test for consciousness using a similar method.\n\nFurther illustrating his idea, Armstrong gives an analogy in which perception is a key to a door, the door being action. The unlocking of the door, and therefore action, is optional, but one cannot open the door without the key. A blind man, for instance, lacks certain keys. As a result, he cannot operate in an environment in the same way that a sighted man can.\n\nUsing this conception of perception as a state, Armstrong characterizes consciousness as \"perception or awareness of the state of our own mind\", or \"a self-scanning system in the central nervous system\". He sees consciousness not as an external construct that interacts with the body and brain, but a self-aware state of the physical brain.\n\n\n"}

The title is a reference to a poem written by the modern Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad.\n\n\"The Wind Will Carry Us\" opened to widely positive reviews from critics; in 1999, it was nominated for the Golden Lion of the Venice Film Festival. It won the Grand Special Jury Prize (Silver Lion), the FIPRESCI Prize, and the CinemAvvenire award at the festival. It received numerous other nominations and awards as well.\n\nBehzad, Keyvan, Ali and Jahan, journalists posing as production engineers, arrive in a Kurdish village to document the locals' mourning rituals that anticipate the death of an old woman, but she remains alive. The main engineer is forced to slow down and appreciate the lifestyle of the village.\n\n\"The Wind Will Carry Us\" opened to wide acclaim from critics. Many hailed it as a masterpiece; the film further cemented Kiarostami's position as one of art-house circles' favorite directors of recent years. In a hugely positive review Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, \"This ambiguous comic masterpiece could be Abbas Kiarostami's greatest film to date; it's undoubtedly his richest and most challenging ... You have to become friends with this movie before it opens up, but then its bounty is endless.\" The \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\"'s Sean Axmaker called it \"a celebration of the human spirit nothing short of sublime.\" Michael Atkinson, after seeing the film in the first days of 2000, said, \"[This is] the best film we'll see this year,\" and stood by his word. J. Hoberman wrote, \"It's part of the movie's formal brilliance that, suddenly, during its final 10 minutes, too much seems to be happening. \"The Wind Will Carry Us\" is a film about nothing and everything—life, death, the quality of light on dusty hills.\" The film currently holds an 86/100 score on review aggregator Metacritic, and Rotten Tomatoes reports 96% approval.\n\n\"The Wind Will Carry Us\" was nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. After its screening at the 1999 Venice Film Festival, the film remained unreleased in the United States until 2000; ultimately, however, this was to its benefit, since it enjoyed a rediscovery among both the public and mainstream critics in the late 2000s after many critics named it one of the best films of that decade. \"Variety\"'s Scott Foundas placed it ahead of Peter Watkins' \"La Commune (Paris, 1871)\" and Paul Thomas Anderson's \"There Will Be Blood\", writing:\n\"Screened in festivals in 1999, but not released in the US until the following year, this fin de siècle/millennium fable by the great Iranian auteur seemed to anticipate many of the dramatic changes that would sweep through filmmaking over the decade to come. In it, an engineer (who turns out to be a kind of filmmaker) travels to a remote Kurdish village with the intent of photographing the funeral rites of a dying 100-year-old woman, and the witty, haunting, poetic film that follows is about his—and Kiarostami's own—struggle to complete that mission, to capture something of real life on film without violating its essence. Kiarostami himself has not worked on film since, preferring the more portable and less invasive technology of video. Call it the first true movie of the digital revolution.\"\nIn a 2012 poll by the British Film Institute, six critics, including Rosenbaum, ranked \"The Wind Will Carry Us\" one of their 10 favorite films.\n\n"}

{"id": "41973789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41973789", "title": "Tyāga", "text": "Tyāga\n\nTyāga (Sanskrit: त्याग) is a Sanskrit word that means \"sacrifice, giving up in generosity, forsaking, resigning\" anything of value, as well as \"renunciation\" depending on the context. It is an ethical concept in Hinduism and Jainism.\n\nTyāga means – sacrifice, renunciation, abandonment, resignation, donation, forsaking, liberality, withdrawal Tyāga which is not merely physical renunciation of the world is different from Sannyasa; Sannyasa which comes from the root as means – \"giving up entirely\", Tyāga means – \"giving up with generosity what one could probably have kept\".\n\nTyāga or abandonment refers to giving up of all anxieties for enjoying the fruits of actions; through practice of this kind of \"tyāga\" infusing discipline in daily activities the momentary anxiety to enjoy fruits of actions is overcome. It is a subjective renunciation of selfishness and desire.\n\n\"Yajna is Tyāga \". The Vedic interpretation of renunciation (\"tyāga \") of the fruits of ritual acts including – \"agnistomena svargakāmo yajeta\" – \"the desire for heaven\", which renunciation is to be found expressed in the phrase – \"agnaye idam na mama\" – \"this is for Agni, not for me\" – pronounced by the yajamana at the time of the oblation.\n\nThe Tejobindu Upanishad belonging to Krishna- yajurveda explains that in \"Tyāga\" ('renunciation') one abandons the manifestations or objects of the universe through the cognition of Atman that is \"Sat\" and \"Cit\" and this is practiced by the wise as the giver of immediate salvation. Thus, Kaivalya Upanishad portrays the state of man on the way of renunciation (\"tyāga\") as having become free of all attachment to the worldly and who, consequently knows and feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all.\n\nMoksha consists in securing lasting freedom from the bondage of existence in the form of birth and death and realizing God who is no other than Bliss (Brahman). Chapter VIII of the Bhagavad Gita deals with Sannyasa and Tyāga, the Paths of Knowledge and Action that are means to the attainment of moksha. Krishna tells Arjuna that even though \"sannyāsa\" is understood as the giving up of all actions motivated by desires, and \"tyāga\" consists in relinquishing the fruit of all actions; that all actions are worth giving up because they contain a measure of evil that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not worth shunning, there are three kinds of \"Tyāga\" – \"Sattvika\", \"Rajasika\" and \"Tamasika\" (Sloka XVIII.4). Whereas acts of sacrifice, charity and penance, the purifiers of wise men, must be performed without attachment and hope of award, Krishna states - मोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः (the abandonment of prescribed duty through ignorance) is not advisable, it is the \"Tamasika\" form of \"tyāga\"; if it is owing to कायक्लेशभयात्तयजेत् (abandonment for fear of physical strain) then it is \"Rajasika\" form; if it is –\n\nThereafter, Arjuna is told about the marks of a Sattvika-man of renunciation and that since all actions cannot be given up in their entirety by anyone possessing a body, he alone, who abstains from prohibited actions and those that are motivated by desire and performs duties, renounces the fruit of actions is called a man of renunciation; no fruits of actions accrues for him (Sloka XVIII.11-12). In the preceding discourses, Krishna had recommended to Arjuna actions which ought to be performed as duty (Ch.III.19); He told him to perform ordained actions (Ch.III.8), to be free from attachment (Ch.III.9,19 & Ch.II.48), and to have no desire for the fruit of action (Ch.II.47); Krishna had recommended \"Sattvika-tyāga\".\n\nSannyasa literally means – throwing away, absolute rejection, formal monastic life; in the Bhagavad Gita, it means – mental state of thorough-going renunciation, of uncompromising abandonment of all that is unfit and unworthy, of intense dispassion toward things of the world, both internal and external. Tyāga literally means – abandonment, the turning from all that hinders the realization of the Self; in the Bhagavad Gita, it means – renunciation in the sense of relinquishment of the fruit of action. Sannyāsa is external, even though it is based on internal disposition; Tyāga is completely mental, it is a state of thought and attitude. Arjuna is emphatically told that it is possible to act and accrue no karma whatsoever; it is a matter of consciousness.\n\nIn this context, Chinmayananda remarks that abandonment is the true content of the status of renunciation – \"sannyāsa\" without the \"tyāga\" spirit is but an empty show; real abandonment is meant for rising to a nobler status of fulfilment, leading on to the ampler fields of expression, to fuller ways of living and to greater experiences of joy. And, Aurobindo explains that – \"Sannysa in the standing of the terminology of the sages means the laying aside of desirable actions. In that sense Tyāga, not Sannyasa, is the better way. It is not the desirable actions that must be laid aside, but the desire that gives them that character has to be put away from us... The spiritual transference of all works to the Master and his Shakti is the real sannyāsa in the teachings of the Gita... The essence of renunciation, the true Tyāga, the true sannyāsa is not any rule of thumb of inaction but a disinterested soul, a selfless mind, the transition from ego to the free impersonal and spiritual nature. \"\n\nSelf-discipline too becomes a form of \"Sattvika-tyāga\", during the course of which exercise one has control over negative emotions and behaviours such as anger, greed and pride. The Bhagavad Gita projects action to serve as steps on the path of spiritual ascent, as an effective means to purify the mind through diligently cultivated mental discipline in action; the true fruit of Tyāga is an elevating sense of peace and fulfillment, even if it entails a bit of physical discomfort.\n\nAccording to Tattvartha Sutra, an ascetic’s dharma consists of ten elements i.e. abstract virtues, which are – \"ksama\" ('forebearance'), \"mardava\" ('humility'), \"arjava\" ('uprightness'), \"sauca\" ('desirelessness'), \"satya\" ('truthfulness'), \"samyama\" ('self-discipline'), \"tapas\" ('self-mortification'), \"tyaga\" ('renunciation'), \"akincanya\" ('poverty') and \"brahmacharya\" ('celibacy'). Hemachandra has recognized only two of the ten \"pratyakhyanas\" viz. \"sanketa-pratyakhyana\" and \"addha-pratyakhyana\", the former, which is of eight types, is symbolic and the devotee refrains from taking food for some time by which renunciation he recalls his mind to his religious duties; the latter, is ritualistic, also connected with abstention from or renouncing food, and has a set methodology to adopt. Ahimsa-vrata practiced by the \"Svetambras\" refers to the renunciation of killing. Basically, there are five kinds of \"tyāgas\" included in the eleven pratimās viz. \"sacitta-tyāga pratimā\", the stage of renouncing uncooked food; \"ārambha-tyāga pratimā\", the stage of abandonment of all professional activity; \"parigraha-tyāga pratimā\", the stage of transferring publicly one’s property to a son or relative; \"anumati-tyāga pratimā\", the stage of leaving the household and refraining from counselling in household matters, and \"uddista-tyāga pratimā\", the stage of not eating food especially prepared for oneself i.e. the stage of seeking alms like a monk, commonly followed by \" Svetambras \", \" Digambaras \" and \"Avasyaka-Curni\". Nemicandra gives a list of eighty-four asatanas which includes \"sacittanām atayāga\" or failure to remove sentient objects and \"ajive tyāga\" or failure to remove non-sentient objects.\n"}

He also was the founder and leader of the French political party, Alliance Royale.\n\nHe is the father of eight.\nHe taught to the University of Poitiers from 1986 till 1989, then left the university and alternated periods of writing books and collaboration in political offices. He teaches again today the history of the political ideas in various centers of higher education.\n\nHis philosophic work concerns three areas of research: in general philosophy, in aesthetics and in politics.\nIn his book \"Le Carré des philosophes\" (the square of philosophers), he builds a \" philosophic square \" sides of which are four propositions: Science, Existence, Presence, and Will. The proposition \"Existence\" is original: Adeline distinguishes the being of the existence itself ; according to him, existence is a dimension of the being. So we can say : the time exists, or a body exists, but a soul does not exist, it \"is\" only, it is without existing, without existence. The presence in the man of a power recovering from the being but not from the existence shows itself by the Will. Adeline wants it to be the criterion of distinction between the man and quite other creature. Adeline considers the will as typically human, rather than the consciousness, of which he considers that it is a little sure concept in philosophy. \nThe will is on the contrary the demonstration of a being in the man, this nonexistent being which shows that a man is not only an object of existence.\n\nYves - Marie Adeline's aesthetic works update the doctrine of Empedocles according to whom \" only the same knows the same \", but also the aristotelian finalism, according to which the best expert of a saddle is not the craftsman, but the rider. In his book \"La Musique et le monde\" (music and world),he fights against the official doctrine of the so-called \"contemporary music\", asserting that this music has been conceived on an exclusively theoretical vision. In \"L'Appel des sirènes\" (the appeal of sirens), Adeline develops his thought and widens it to the plastic arts.\n\nIn \"Le Pouvoir légitime\" (the justifiable power), preferring good institutions to good leaders, he recommends \" an abdication of each of us for the benefit of a common and wholesome principle \", and concludes that a modern monarchy is the best regime. Opponent of the maurrassism, or any other nationalism, he prefers Bonald, and advances the mixed regime (monarchy - aristocracy - democracy).\n\nYves-Marie Adeline is also a poet : \"L'Epouse\" (the wife); \"Le Manteau d'étoiles\" (the coat of stars); \"Radieuse hostie\" (radiant host) ; \"Les Angéliques \"(angelica).\n\nHe has been the president of Alliance Royale, the French royalist party. Candidate with the European elections in 2004, then candidate with presidential election in 2007, he did not obtain the 500 votes of the mayors. With the municipal elections of March 2008 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, he got 0.96%. He has since resigned the political militancy.\n\n\n"}
