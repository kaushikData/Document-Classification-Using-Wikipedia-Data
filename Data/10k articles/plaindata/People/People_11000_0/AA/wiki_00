{"id": "158252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158252", "title": "Adam Mickiewicz", "text": "Adam Mickiewicz\n\nAdam Bernard Mickiewicz (; 24 December 179826 November 1855) was a Polish poet, dramatist, essayist, publicist, translator, professor of Slavic literature, and political activist. He is regarded as national poet in Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. A principal figure in Polish Romanticism, he is counted as one of Poland's \"Three Bards\" (\"Trzej Wieszcze\") and is widely regarded as Poland's greatest poet. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets and has been dubbed a \"Slavic bard\". A leading Romantic dramatist, he has been compared in Poland and Europe to Byron and Goethe.\n\nHe is known chiefly for the poetic drama \"Dziady\" (\"Forefathers' Eve\") and the national epic poem \"Pan Tadeusz\". His other influential works include \"Konrad Wallenrod\" and \"Grażyna\". All these served as inspiration for uprisings against the three imperial powers that had partitioned the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of existence.\n\nMickiewicz was born in the Russian-partitioned territories of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had been part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was active in the struggle to win independence for his home region. After, as a consequence, spending five years exiled to central Russia, in 1829 he succeeded in leaving the Russian Empire and, like many of his compatriots, lived out the rest of his life abroad. He settled first in Rome, then in Paris, where for a little over three years he lectured on Slavic literature at the Collège de France. He died, probably of cholera, at Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, where he had gone to help organize Polish and Jewish forces to fight Russia in the Crimean War.\n\nIn 1890, his remains were repatriated from Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, in France, to Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, Poland.\n\nAdam Mickiewicz was born on 24 December 1798, either at his paternal uncle's estate in Zaosie (now Zavosse) near Navahrudak (in Polish, \"Nowogródek\") or in Navahrudak itself in what was then part of the Russian Empire and is now Belarus. The region was on the periphery of Lithuania proper and had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either Polish or Polonized. The poet's father, Mikołaj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish nobility (\"szlachta\") and bore the hereditary Poraj coat-of-arms; Adam's mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, \"née\" Majewska. Adam was the second-born son in the family.\n\nMickiewicz spent his childhood in Navahrudak, initially taught by his mother and private tutors. From 1807 to 1815 he attended a Dominican school following a curriculum that had been designed by the now-defunct Polish Commission for National Education, which had been the world's first ministry of education. He was a mediocre student, although active in games, theatricals, and the like.\n\nIn September 1815, Mickiewicz enrolled at the Imperial University of Vilnius, studying to be a teacher. After graduating, under the terms of his government scholarship, he taught secondary school at Kaunas from 1819 to 1823.\n\nIn 1818, in the Polish-language \" (Wilno Weekly), he published his first poem, \"Zima miejska\"\" (\"City Winter\"). The next few years would see a maturing of his style from sentimentalism/neoclassicism to romanticism, first in his poetry anthologies published in Vilnius in 1822 and 1823; these anthologies included the poem \"Grażyna\" and the first-published parts (II and IV) of his major work, \"Dziady\" (\"Forefathers' Eve\"). By 1820 he had already finished another major romantic poem, \"Oda do młodości\" (\"Ode to Youth\"), but it was considered to be too patriotic and revolutionary for publication and would not appear officially for many years.\n\nAbout the summer of 1820, Mickiewicz met the love of his life, . They were unable to marry due to his family's poverty and relatively low social status; in addition, she was already engaged to Count , whom she would marry in 1821.\n\nIn 1817, while still a student, Mickiewicz, Tomasz Zan and other friends had created a secret organization, the Philomaths. The group focused on self-education but had ties to a more radical, clearly pro-Polish-independence student group, the Filaret Association. An investigation of secret student organizations by Nikolay Novosiltsev, begun in early 1823, led to the arrests of a number of students and ex-student activists including Mickiewicz, who was taken into custody and imprisoned at Vilnius' Basilian monastery in late 1823 or early 1824 (sources disagree as to the date). After investigation into his political activities, specifically his membership in the Philomaths, in 1824 Mickiewicz was banished to central Russia. Within a few hours of receiving the decree on 22 October 1824, he penned a poem into an album belonging to Salomea Bécu, the mother of Juliusz Słowacki. (In 1975 this poem was set to music in Polish and Russian by Soviet composer David Tukhmanov.) Mickiewicz crossed the border into Russia about 11 November 1824, arriving in Saint Petersburg later that month. He would spend most of the next five years in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, except for a notable 1824 to 1825 excursion to Odessa, then on to Crimea. That visit, from February to November 1825, inspired a notable collection of sonnets (some love sonnets, and a series known as \"Crimean Sonnets\", published a year later).\n\nMickiewicz was welcomed into the leading literary circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, where he became a great favorite for his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation. The year 1828 saw the publication of his poem \"Konrad Wallenrod\". Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.\n\nIn Moscow, Mickiewicz met the Polish journalist and novelist Henryk Rzewuski and the Polish composer and piano virtuoso Maria Szymanowska, whose daughter, Celina Szymanowska, Mickiewicz would later marry in Paris, France. He also befriended the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and Decembrist leaders including Kondraty Ryleyev. It was thanks to his friendships with many influential individuals that he was eventually able to obtain a passport and permission to leave Russia for Western Europe.\n\nAfter serving five years of exile to Russia, Mickiewicz received permission to go abroad in 1829. On 1 June that year, he arrived in Weimar. By 6 June he was in Berlin, where he attended lectures by the philosopher Hegel. In February 1830 he visited Prague, later returning to Weimar, where he received a cordial reception from the writer, scientist and politician Goethe.\n\nHe then continued on through Germany all the way to Italy, which he entered via the Alps' Splügen Pass. Accompanied by an old friend, the poet Antoni Edward Odyniec, he visited Milan, Venice, Florence and Rome. In August that same year (1830) he went to Geneva, where he met fellow Polish Bard Zygmunt Krasiński. During these travels he had a brief romance with , but class differences again prevented his marrying his new love.\n\nFinally about October 1830 he took up residence in Rome, which he declared \"the most amiable of foreign cities.\" Soon after, he learned about the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising in Poland, but he would not leave Rome until the spring of 1831.\n\nOn 19 April 1831 Mickiewicz departed Rome, traveling to Geneva and Paris and later, on a false passport, to Germany, via Dresden and Leipzig arriving about 13 August in Poznań (German name: Posen), then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. It is possible that during these travels he carried communications from the Italian Carbonari to the French underground, and delivered documents or money for the Polish insurgents from the Polish community in Paris, but reliable information on his activities at the time is scarce. Ultimately he never crossed into Russian Poland, where the Uprising was mainly happening; he stayed in German Poland (historically known to Poles as \"Wielkopolska\", or Greater Poland), where he was well received by members of the local Polish nobility. He had a brief liaison with Konstancja Łubieńska at her family estate. Starting in March 1832, Mickiewicz stayed several months in Dresden, in Saxony, where he wrote the third part of his poem \"Dziady\".\n\nOn 31 July 1832 he arrived in Paris, accompanied by a close friend and fellow ex-Philomath, the future geologist and Chilean educator Ignacy Domeyko. In Paris, Mickiewicz became active in many Polish émigré groups and published articles in ' (The Polish Pilgrim). The fall of 1832 saw the publication, in Paris, of the third part of his \"Dziady\" (smuggled into partitioned Poland), as well as of ', which Mickiewicz self-published. In 1834 he published another masterpiece, his epic poem \"Pan Tadeusz\".\n\n\"Pan Tadeusz\", his longest poetic work, marked the end of his most productive literary period. Mickiewicz would create further notable works, such as \"\", 1839–40) and \"Zdania i uwagi\" (Thoughts and Remarks, 1834–40), but neither would achieve the fame of his earlier works. His relative literary silence, beginning in the mid-1830s, has been variously interpreted: he may have lost his talent; he may have chosen to focus on teaching and on political writing and organizing.\n\nOn 22 July 1834, in Paris, he married Celina Szymanowska, daughter of composer and concert pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska. They would have six children (two daughters, Maria and Helena; and four sons, Władysław, Aleksander, Jan and Józef). Celina later became mentally ill, possibly with a major depressive disorder. In December 1838, marital problems caused Mickiewicz to attempt suicide. Celina would die on 5 March 1855.\n\nMickiewicz and his family lived in relative poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, but not enough to substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.\n\nIn 1838 Mickiewicz became professor of Latin literature at the Lausanne Academy, in Switzerland. His lectures were well received, and in 1840 he was appointed to the newly established chair of Slavic languages and literatures at the Collège de France. Leaving Lausanne, he was made an honorary Lausanne Academy professor.\n\nMickiewicz would, however, hold the Collège de France post for little more than three years, his last lecture being delivered on 28 May 1844. His lectures were popular, drawing many listeners in addition to enrolled students, and receiving reviews in the press. Some would be remembered much later; his sixteenth lecture, on Slavic theater, \"was to become a kind of gospel for Polish theater directors of the twentieth century.\"\n\nBut he became increasingly possessed by religious mysticism as he fell under the influence of the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.\n\nIn 1846 Mickiewicz severed his ties with Towiański, following the rise of revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in events such as the Kraków Uprising of February 1846. Mickiewicz criticized Towiański's passivity and returned to the traditional Catholic Church. In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women's-rights advocate Margaret Fuller. In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by Pope Pius IX, whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the French Revolution of 1848. Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the Mickiewicz Legion, to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands. The unit never became large enough to be more than symbolic, and in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.\n\nIn December 1848 he was offered a post at the Jagiellonian University in Austrian-ruled Kraków, but the offer was soon withdrawn after pressure from Austrian authorities. In the winter of 1848–49, Polish composer Frédéric Chopin, in the final months of his own life, visited his ailing compatriot and soothed the poet's nerves with his piano music. Over a dozen years earlier, Chopin had set two of Mickiewicz's poems to music (see Polish songs by Frédéric Chopin).\n\nIn the winter of 1849 Mickiewicz founded a French-language newspaper, \"La Tribune des Peuples\" (\"The Peoples' Tribune\"), supported by a wealthy Polish émigré activist, . Mickiewicz wrote over 70 articles for the \"Tribune\" during its short existence: it came out between 15 March and 10 November 1849, when the authorities shut it down. His articles supported democracy and socialism and many ideals of the French Revolution and of the Napoleonic era, though he held few illusions regarding the idealism of the House of Bonaparte. He supported the restoration of the French Empire in 1851. In April 1852 he lost his post at the Collège de France, which he had been allowed to keep (though without the right to lecture). On 31 October 1852 he was hired as a librarian at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal. There he was visited by another Polish poet, Cyprian Norwid, who wrote of the meeting in his poem, \"Czarne kwiaty\" (\"Black Blossoms\"); and there Mickiewicz's wife Celina died.\n\nMickiewicz welcomed the Crimean War of 1853-1856, which he hoped would lead to a new European order including a restored independent Poland. His last composition, a Latin ode \"Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum\", honored Napoleon III and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the Battle of Bomarsund in the Åland Islands in August 1854. Polish émigrés associated with the Hôtel Lambert persuaded him to become active again in politics. Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission. He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire, on 22 September. There, working with Michał Czajkowski (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia. With his friend Armand Lévy he also set about organizing a Jewish legion. He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yenişehir Street in the Pera (now Beyoğlu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855. Though Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there is no proof of this, and he probably contracted cholera, which claimed other lives there at the time.\n\nMickiewicz's remains were transported to France, boarding ship on 31 December 1855, and were buried at Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, on 21 January 1861. In 1890 they were disinterred, moved to Austrian Poland, and on 4 July entombed in the crypts of Kraków's Wawel Cathedral, a place of final repose for a number of persons important to Poland's political and cultural history.\n\nMickiewicz's childhood environment exerted a major influence on his literary work. His early years were shaped by immersion in Belarusian folklore and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. The year 1812 also marked his father's death. Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in Vilnius.\n\nHis first poems, such as the 1818 \"Zima miejska\" (\"City Winter\") and the 1819 \"Kartofla\" (\"Potato\"), were classical in style, influenced by Voltaire. His poetry anthologies published in 1822 (including the opening poem \"Romantyczność\", \"Romanticism\") and 1823 mark the start of romanticism in Poland. Mickiewicz's influence popularized the use of folklore, folk literary forms, and historism in Polish romantic literature. His exile to Moscow exposed him to a cosmopolitan environment, more international than provincial Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania. This period saw a further evolution in his writing style, with \"Sonety\" (Sonnets, 1826) and \"Konrad Wallenrod\" (1828), both published in Russia. The \"Sonety\", mainly comprising his \"Crimean Sonnets\", highlight the poet's ability and desire to write, and his longing for his homeland.\n\nOne of his major works, \"Dziady\" (Forefathers' Eve), comprises several parts written over an extended period of time. It began with publication of parts II and IV in 1823. Miłosz remarks that it was \"Mickiewicz's major theatrical achievement\", a work which Mickiewicz saw as ongoing and to be continued in further parts. Its title refers to the pagan ancestor commemoration that had been practiced by Slavic and Baltic peoples on All Souls' Day. The year 1832 saw the publication of part III: much superior to the earlier parts, a \"laboratory of innovative genres, styles and forms\". Part III was largely written over a few days; the \"Great Improvisation\" section, a \"masterpiece of Polish poetry\", is said to have been created during a single inspired night. A long descriptive poem, \"Ustęp\" (Digression), accompanying part III and written sometime before it, sums up Mickiewicz's experiences in, and views on, Russia, portrays it as a huge prison, pities the oppressed Russian people, and wonders about their future. Miłosz describes it as a \"summation of Polish attitudes towards Russia in the nineteenth century\" and notes that it inspired responses from Pushkin (\"The Bronze Horseman\") and Joseph Conrad (\"Under Western Eyes\"). The drama was first staged by Stanisław Wyspiański in 1901, becoming, in Miłosz's words, \"a kind of national sacred play, occasionally forbidden by censorship because of its emotional impact upon the audience.\" The Polish government's 1968 closing down of a production of the play sparked the 1968 Polish political crisis.\n\nMickiewicz's \"Konrad Wallenrod\" (1828), a narrative poem describing battles of the Christian order of Teutonic Knights against the pagans of Lithuania, is a thinly veiled allusion to the long feud between Russia and Poland. The plot involves the use of subterfuge against a stronger enemy, and the poem analyzes moral dilemmas faced by the Polish insurgents who would soon launch the November 1830 Uprising. Controversial to an older generation of readers, \"Konrad Wallenrod\" was seen by the young as a call to arms and was praised as such by an Uprising leader, poet . Miłosz describes \"Konrad Wallenrod\" (named for its protagonist) as \"the most committed politically of all Mickiewczi's poems.\" The point of the poem, though obvious to many, escaped the Russian censors, and the poem was allowed to be published, complete with its telling motto drawn from Machiavelli: \"Dovete adunque sapere come sono due generazioni di combattere – bisogna essere volpe e leone.\" (\"Ye shall know that there are two ways of fighting – you must be a fox and a lion.\") On a purely literary level, the poem was notable for incorporating traditional folk elements alongside stylistic innovations.\n\nSimilarly noteworthy is Mickiewicz's earlier and longer 1823 poem, \"Grażyna\", depicting the exploits of a Lithuanian chieftainess against the Teutonic Knights. Miłosz writes that \"Grażyna\" \"combines a metallic beat of lines and syntactical rigor with a plot and motifs dear to the Romantics.\" It is said by Christien Ostrowski to have inspired Emilia Plater, a military heroine of the November 1830 Uprising. A similar message informs Mickiewicz's \"Oda do młodości\" (\"Ode to Youth\").\n\nMickiewicz's \"Crimean Sonnets\" (1825–26) and poems that he would later write in Rome and Lausanne, Miłosz notes, have been \"justly ranked among the highest achievements in Polish [lyric poetry].\" His 1830 travels in Italy likely inspired him to consider religious matters, and produced some of his best religiously-themed works, such as \"Arcymistrz\" (\"The Master\") and \"Do Marceliny Łempickiej\" (\"To Marcelina Łempicka\"). He was an authority to the young insurgents of 1830–31, who expected him to participate in the fighting (the poet wrote a dedicated poem urging him to do so). Yet it is likely that Mickiewicz was no longer as idealistic and supportive of military action as he had been a few years earlier, and his new works such as \"Do matki Polki\" (\"To a Polish Mother\", 1830), while still patriotic, also began to reflect on the tragedy of resistance. His meetings with refugees and escaping insurgents around 1831 resulted in works such as \"Reduta Ordona\" (\"Ordon's Redoubt\"), \"Nocleg\" (\"Night Bivouac\") and \"Śmierć pułkownika\" (\"Death of the Colonel\"). Wyka notes the irony that some of the most important literary works about the 1830 Uprising were written by Mickiewicz, who never took part in a battle or even saw a battlefield.\n\nHis \"Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego\" (Books of the Polish Nation and the Polish Pilgrimage, 1832) opens with a historical-philosophical discussion of the history of humankind in which Mickiewicz argues that history is the history of now-unrealized freedom that awaits many oppressed nations in the future. It is followed by a longer \"moral catechism\" aimed at Polish émigrés. The book sets out a messianist metaphor of Poland as the \"Christ of nations\". Described by Wyka as a propaganda piece, it was relatively simple, using biblical metaphors and the like to reach less-discriminating readers. It became popular not only among Poles but, in translations, among some other peoples, primarily those which lacked their own sovereign states. The \"Books\" were influential in framing Mickiewicz's image among many not as that of a poet and author but as that of ideologue of freedom.\n\n\"Pan Tadeusz\" (published 1834), another of his masterpieces, is an epic poem that draws a picture of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on the eve of Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. It is written entirely in thirteen-syllable couplets. Originally intended as an apolitical idyll, it became, as Miłosz writes, \"something unique in world literature, and the problem of how to classify it has remained the crux of a constant quarrel among scholars\"; it \"has been called 'the last epos' in world literature\". \"Pan Tadeusz\" was not highly regarded by contemporaries, nor by Mickiewicz himself, but in time it won acclaim as \"the highest achievement in all Polish literature.\"\n\nThe occasional poems that Mickiewicz wrote in his final decades have been described as \"exquisite, gnomic, extremely short and concise\". His \"\", (1839–40) are, writes Miłosz, \"untranslatable masterpieces of metaphysical meditation. In Polish literature they are examples of that pure poetry that verges on silence.\"\n\nIn the 1830s (as early as 1830; as late as 1837) he worked on a futurist or science-fiction work, \"A History of the Future\". It predicted inventions similar to radio and television, and interplanetary communication using balloons. Written in French, it was never completed and was partly destroyed by the author. Other French-language works by Mickiewicz include the dramas \"Les Confederes de Bar\" (The Bar Confederates) and \"Jacques Jasiński, ous les deux Polognes\" (Jacques Jasiński, or the Two Polands). These would not achieve much recognition, and would not be published till 1866. While Mickiewicz did not write any poems in Lithuanian, and his command of that language has been described as likely limited, on one occasion in the early 1850s he transcribed a short folk song in that language, \"Ejk Tatuszeli i bytiu darża\".\n\nA prime figure of the Polish Romantic period, Mickiewicz is counted as one of Poland's's Three Bards (the others being Zygmunt Krasiński and Juliusz Słowacki) and the greatest poet in all Polish literature. Mickiewicz has long been regarded as Poland's national poet and is a revered figure in Lithuania. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets. He has been described as a \"Slavic bard\". He was a leading Romantic dramatist and has been compared in Poland and in Europe with Byron and Goethe.\n\nMickiewicz's importance extends beyond literature to the broader spheres of culture and politics; Wyka writes that he was a \"singer and epic poet of the Polish people, and a pilgrim for the freedom of nations.\" Scholars have used the expression \"cult of Mickiewicz\" to describe the reverence in which he is held as a \"national prophet.\" On hearing of Mickiewicz's death, his fellow bard Krasiński wrote: \"For men of my generation, he was milk and honey, gall and life's blood: we all descend from him. He carried us off on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world.\" Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin described Mickiewicz's works as Promethean, as \"reaching more Polish hearts\" than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic Georg Brandes' assessment of Mickiewicz's works as \"healthier\" than those of Byron, Shakespeare, Homer, and Goethe. Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has \"informed the foundations of [many] parties and ideologies\" in Poland from the 19th century to this day, \"down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'\" While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among \"people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires.\"\n\nMickiewicz has been written about or had works dedicated to him by many authors in Poland (Asnyk, Gałczyński, Iwaszkiewicz, Jastrun, Kasprowicz, Lechoń, Konopnicka, Teofil Lenartowicz, Norwid, Przyboś, Różewicz, Słonimski, Słowacki, Staff, Tetmajer, Tuwim, Ujejski, Wierzyński, Zaleski and others) and by authors outside Poland (Bryusov, Goethe, Pushkin, Uhland, Vrchlický and others). He has been a character in works of fiction, including a large body of dramatized biographies, e.g., in 1900, Stanisław Wyspiański's \"Legion\". He has also been a subject of many paintings, by Eugène Delacroix, Józef Oleszkiewicz, Aleksander Orłowski, Wojciech Stattler and Walenty Wańkowicz. Monuments and other tributes (streets and schools named for him) abound in Poland and Lithuania, and in other former territories of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: Ukraine and Belarus. He has also been the subject of many statues and busts by Antoine Bourdelle, David d'Angers, , Władysław Oleszczyński, , Teodor Rygier, Wacław Szymanowski and . In 1898, the 100th anniversary of his birth, a towering statue by Cyprian Godebski was erected in Warsaw. Its base carries the inscription, \"To the Poet from the People\". In 1955, the 100th anniversary of his death, the University of Poznań adopted him as its official patron.\n\nA number of museums in Europe are dedicated to Mickiewicz. Warsaw has an Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature. His house in Navahrudak, Belarus, is now a museum (); as is the house where he lived and died in Constantinople (Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Istanbul). There is a \"Musée Adam Mickiewicz\" in Paris, France.\n\nMuch has been written about Mickiewicz, though the vast majority of this scholarly and popular literature is available only in Polish. Works devoted to him, according to Koropeckyi, author of a 2008 English biography, \"could fill a good shelf or two\". Koropeckyi notes that, apart from some specialist literature, only five book-length biographies of Mickiewicz have been published in English. He also writes that, though many of Mickiewicz's works have been reprinted numerous times, no language has a \"definitive critical edition of his works.\"\n\nAdam Mickiewicz, whose works were written in the Polish language, is generally known as a Polish poet. He is described by some authors as \"Polish-Lithuanian\" or Belarusian-Polish. \"The Cambridge History of Russia\" describes him as Polish but sees his ethnic origins as \"Lithuanian-Belarusian (and perhaps Jewish).\" According to the Belarusian historian Rybczonek, Mickiewicz's mother had Tatar (Polish Tatars) roots.\n\nSome sources assert that Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, Frankist Jewish family. Others view this as improbable. Polish historian Kazimierz Wyka, in his biographic entry in \"Polski Słownik Biograficzny\" (1975) writes that this hypothesis, based on the fact that his mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among Frankist Jews, has not been proven. Wyka states that poet's mother was the daughter of a noble (\"szlachta\") family of Starykoń coat of arms, living on an estate at Czombrów in Nowogródek Voivodeship (Navahrudak Voivodeship).\n\nThe Lithuanian scholar of literature writes that Mickiewicz's family was descended from an old Lithuanian noble family (Rimvydas) with origins predating Lithuania's Christianization. The Lithuanian nobility in Mickiewicz's time was heavily Polonized and spoke Polish. Mickiewicz had been brought up in the culture of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a multicultural state that had encompassed most of what today are the separate countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. To Mickiewicz, a splitting of that multicultural state into separate entities, due to trends such as Lithuanian separatism, was undesirable, if not outright unthinkable. According to Romanucci-Ross, while Mickiewicz called himself a \" Litwin\" (\"Lithuanian\"), in his time the idea of a separate \"Lithuanian identity\", apart from a \"Polish\" one, did not exist. This multicultural aspect is evident in his works; his most famous poetic work, \"Pan Tadeusz\", begins with the Polish-language invocation, \"O Lithuania, my country, thou art like good health ...\" (\"Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jesteś jak zdrowie ...\". It is generally accepted, however, that Mickiewicz, when referring to Lithuania, meant a historical region rather than a linguistic and cultural entity, and he often applied the term \"Lithuanian\" to the Slavic inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (see Litvin). Mickiewicz joined the Philomaths while studying at Vilnius University, an organisation which supported the re-emergence of a Polish state free of Russian influence, but which did not support the emergence of separate Lithuanian or Belarusian states.\n\nSource: \n\n\na Czesław Miłosz and Kazimierz Wyka each note that Adam Mickiewicz's exact birthplace cannot be ascertained due to conflicting records and missing documentation.\n\n\n\n"}

Her parents were Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet and his wife Elizabeth Heneage who became the 1st Countess of Winchilsea. Anne learned four languages as a child at the court of Queen Elizabeth whilst in the care of her grandmother Elizabeth (born Heneage). Anne married William Twysden who was made a baronet.

She had her own ladies-in-waiting which included Isabella Saunder and Jane Thomlinson and she married these off to her son Roger in 1635 and to another son Thomas in 1639. She had two houses at East Peckham and Redcross Street in London.\n\nHer children had to persuade her to pay Charles I's Ship money which she objected to. She wrote a book of devotions that was edited and published by her son Roger. Her son's notes show that this was published after her death in 1638. The Twysden papers and two of her letters are held by the British Library. Twysden's original copy of her devotions was known to have existed until 1849 but it is now lost.\n\nTwysden died in Kent in 1638.\n"}
{"id": "164101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164101", "title": "Arabic name", "text": "Arabic name\n\nArabic names were historically based on a long naming system; most Arabs did not have given/middle/family names, but a full chain of names. This system was mainly in use throughout the Arab world.\n\nThe \" (), is the given name, first name, or personal name; e.g. \"Ahmad\" or \"Fatimah\". Most Arabic names have meaning as ordinary adjectives and nouns, and are often aspirational of character. For example, \"Muhammad\" means 'Praiseworthy' and \"Ali\" means 'Exalted' or 'High'.\n\nThe syntactic context will generally differentiate the name from the noun/adjective. However Arabic newspapers will occasionally place names in brackets, or quotation marks, to avoid confusion.\n\nIndeed such is the popularity of the name \"Muhammad\" throughout parts of Africa, Arabia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, it is often represented by the abbreviation \"Md.\", \"Mohd.\", \"Muhd.\", or just \"M.\". In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, due to its almost ubiquitous use as a first name, a person will often be referred to by their second name:\nThe \"laqab\" (), pl. \"alqāb\" (); agnomen; cognomen; nickname; title, honorific; last name, surname, family name. The \"laqab\" is typically descriptive of the person.\n\nAn example is the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (of \"One Thousand and One Nights\" fame). ' is the Arabic version of the name \"Aaron\" and ' means \"the Rightly-Guided\".\n\nIn ancient Arab societies, use of a \"laqab\" was common, but today is restricted to the surname, or family name, of birth.\n\nThe \"nasab\" () is a patronymic or series of patronymics. It indicates the person's heritage by the word \"ibn\" ( \"son\", colloquially \"bin\") or \"ibnat\" ( \"daughter\", also \"bint\", abbreviated \"bte.\").\n\nIbn Khaldun () means \"son of Khaldun\". Khaldun is the father's personal name or, in this particular case, the name of a remote ancestor.\n\nSeveral \"nasab\" names can follow in a chain to trace a person's ancestry backwards in time, as was important in the tribally based society of the ancient Arabs, both for purposes of identification and for socio-political interactions. Today, however, \"ibn\" or \"bint\" is no longer used (unless it is the official naming style in a country, region, etc.: Adnen bin Abdallah). The plural is ' for males and ' for females. However, ' or ' is tribal and encompasses both sexes.\n\nThe \"nisbah\" () surname could be an everyday name, but is mostly the name of the ancestral tribe, city, country, or any other term used to show relevance. It follows a family through several generations. It most often appears as a demonym (ex. البغدادي \"Al-Baghdadi\", meaning that the person is of Baghdad or descendant of people from Baghdad).\n\nThe \"laqab\" and \"nisbah\" are similar in use, thus, a name rarely contains both.\n\nA \"kunya\" (, \"kunyah\") is a teknonym in Arabic names. It is a component of an Arabic name, a type of epithet, in theory referring to the bearer's first-born son or daughter. By extension, it may also have hypothetical or metaphorical references, e.g. in a \"nom de guerre\" or a nickname, without literally referring to a son or a daughter. For example, Sabri Khalil al-Banna was known as Abu Nidal, \"father of struggle\".\n\nUse of a kunya implies a familiar but respectful setting.\n\nA kunya is expressed by the use of \"abū\" (father) or \"umm\" (mother) in a genitive construction, i.e. \"father of\" or \"mother of\" as an honorific in place of or alongside given names in the Arab world and the Islamic world more generally.\n\nA kunya may also be a nickname expressing the attachment of an individual to a certain thing, as in Abu Bakr, \"father of the camel foal\", given because of this person's kindness towards camels.\n\nA common name-form among Arab Muslims is the prefix ' (\"servant\", ') combined with the name of Allah (God), \"\" ( \"servant of God\"), or with one of the epithets of Allah. \n\nAs a mark of deference, \"\" is usually not conjoined with the prophets' names. Nonetheless such names are accepted in some areas. Its use is not exclusive to Muslims and in Lebanon and Egypt, the name \"Abdel-Massih\", \"Servant of Christ\", is a common Christian last name.\n\nDuring the Persian Ghurid dynasty, Amir Suri and his son Muhammad ibn Suri adopted Muslim names despite being non-Muslims. Other non-Muslim peoples, such as the Kalash, also take names such as Muhammad.\n\nConverts to Islam may often continue using the native non-Arabic non-Islamic names that are without any polytheistic connotation, or association.\n\nTo an extent Arab Christians have names indistinguishable from Muslims, excepting some explicitly Islamic names, e.g. \"Muhammad\". Some common Christian names are:\n\nSome people, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, when descendant of a famous ancestor, start their last name with \"Āl\" \"family, clan\" (), like the House of Saud \"Āl Ṣaʻūd\" or Al ash-Sheikh (\"family of the sheikh\"). \"Āl\" is distinct from the definite article (). If a reliably-sourced version of the Arabic spelling includes (as a separate graphic word), then this is a case of the definite article, so (capitalised and followed by a space, not a hyphen) should be used. \"Ahl\", which has a similar meaning, is sometimes used and should be used if the Arabic spelling is .\n\nDynasty membership alone does necessarily imply that the dynastic is used – e.g. Bashar al-Assad.\n\nMuḥammad ibn Salmān ibn Amīn al-Farsī\n\n\"Muḥammad, son of Salmān, son of Amīn, the Persian\"\n\nThis person would simply be referred to as \"Muḥammad\" or by his kunya, which relates him to his first-born son, e.g. \"Abū Karīm\" \"father of Karīm\". To signify respect or to specify which Muḥammad one is speaking about, the name could be lengthened to the extent necessary or desired.\n\nNon-Arabic speakers often make these mistakes:\n\nIn Arabic culture, as in many parts of the world, a person's ancestry and family name are very important. An example is explained below.\n\nAssume a man is called \"Saleh ibn Tariq ibn Khalid al-Fulan\".\nHence, \"Saleh ibn Tariq ibn Khalid al-Fulan\" translates as \"Saleh, son of Tariq, son of Khalid; of the family al-Fulan.\"\n\nThe Arabic for \"daughter of\" is \"bint.\" A woman with the name \"Fatimah bint Tariq ibn Khalid al-Goswami\" translates as \"Fatimah, daughter of Tariq, son of Khalid; of the family al-Goswami.\"\n\nIn this case, ibn and bint are included in the official naming. Most Arab countries today, however, do not use 'ibn' and 'bint' in their naming system. If Saleh were an Egyptian, he would be called \"Saleh Tariq Khalid al-Fulan\" and Fatimah would be \"Fatimah Tariq Khalid al-Goswami.\"\n\nIf Saleh marries a wife (who would keep her own maiden, family, and surnames), their children will take Saleh's family name. Therefore, their son Mohammed would be called \"Mohammed ibn Saleh ibn Tariq al-Fulan.\"\n\nHowever, not all Arab countries use the name in its full length, but conventionally use two- and three-word names, and sometimes four-word names in official or legal matters. Thus the first name is the personal name, the middle name is the father's name and the last name is the family name.\n\nThe Arabic names listed below are used in the Arab world, as well as some other Muslim regions, with correspondent Hebrew, English, Syriac and Greek equivalents in many cases. They are not necessarily of Arabic origin, although some are. Most are derived from Syriac transliterations of the Hebrew Bible. For more information, see also Iranian, Malay, Pakistani, and Turkish names.\n\n\nAccording to the Chicago Manual of Style, Arabic names are indexed by their surnames. Names may be alphabetized under \"Abu\" \"Abd\" and \"ibn\", while names are not alphabetized under \"al-\" and \"el-\" and are instead alphabetized under the following element.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41132319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41132319", "title": "Avraham Stern", "text": "Avraham Stern\n\nAvraham Stern (, \"Avraham Shtern\"), alias Yair (; December 23, 1907 – February 12, 1942) was one of the leaders of the Jewish paramilitary organization Irgun. In September 1940, he founded a breakaway militant Zionist group named Lehi, called the \"Stern Gang\" by the British authorities and by the mainstream in the Yishuv Jewish establishment.\n\nStern was born in Suwałki, present-day Poland (then part of the Russian Empire). During the First World War his mother fled the Germans with him and his brother David. They found refuge with her sister in Russia. When he was separated from his mother the 13-year-old Avraham earned his keep by carrying river water in Siberia. Eventually he stayed with an uncle in St. Petersburg before walking home to Poland. At the age of 18, in 1925, Stern emigrated on his own to Palestine.\n\nStern studied at the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem. He specialized in Classical languages and literature (Greek and Latin). His first political involvement was to found a student organization called “Hulda,” whose regulations stated it was dedicated “solely to the revival of the Hebrew nation in a new state.” During the 1929 riots in Palestine, Jewish communities came under attack by local Arabs, and Stern served with the Haganah, doing guard duty on a synagogue rooftop in Jerusalem’s Old City.\n\nStern’s commander and friend Avraham Tehomi quit the Haganah because it was under the authority of the local labor movement and union. Hoping to create an independent army, and also to take a more active and less defensive military position, Tehomi founded the Irgun Zvai Leumi (\"National Military Organization\" known for short as the \"Organization\"). Stern joined the Irgun and completed an officer’s course in 1932.\n\nDuring his life Stern wrote dozens of poems embodying a physical, almost sensual, love for the Jewish homeland and a similar attitude towards martyrdom on its behalf. One analyst referred to the poems as expressing the eroticism of death together with de-eroticism of women. Stern’s poetry was heavily influenced by Russian and Polish poetry, especially Vladimir Mayakovsky’s. His song \"Unknown Soldiers\" was adopted first by the Irgun and later by the Lehi as an underground anthem. In it Stern sang of Jews who would not be drafted by other countries while they wandered in Exile from their own country, but rather who would enlist in a volunteer army of their own, go underground and die fighting in the streets, only to be buried secretly at night. One of the commanders of Lehi, Israel Eldad, claimed this song (along with two others, written by Uri Zvi Greenberg and Vladimir Jabotinsky) actually led to the creation of the underground. In other poems from the same period, up to eight years before he founded the Lehi underground, Stern detailed the feelings of revolutionaries hiding in basements or sitting in prison and wrote of dying in a hail of bullets. One example of his poetry is: “You are betrothed to me, my homeland \\ According to all the laws of Moses and Israel… \\ And with my death I will bury my head in your lap \\ And you will live forever in my blood.”\n\nStern became one of the university’s top students. He was awarded a stipend to study for a doctorate in Florence, Italy. Avraham Tehomi made a special trip to Florence to recall him, in order to make him his deputy in the Irgun.\n\nStern spent the rest of the 1930s traveling back and forth to Eastern Europe to organize revolutionary cells in Poland and promote immigration of Jews to Palestine in defiance of British restrictions (this was therefore known as “illegal immigration”).\n\nStern developed a plan to train 40,000 young Jews to sail for Palestine and take over the country from the British colonial authorities. He succeeded in enlisting the Polish government in this effort. The Poles began training Irgun members and arms were set aside, but then Germany invaded Poland and began the Second World War. This ended the training, and immigration routes were cut off. Stern was in Palestine at the time and was arrested the same night the war began. He was incarcerated together with the entire High Command of the Irgun in the Jerusalem Central Prison and Sarafand Detention Camp.\n\nWhile under arrest, Stern and the other members of the Irgun argued about what to do during the war. He founded Lehi in August 1940 initially under a different name, it adopted the name Lehi, a Hebrew acronym for Lohamei Herut Israel, meaning Fighters for the Freedom of Israel, in September 1940. The movement was formed after Stern and others split from the Irgun, when the latter adopted the Haganah’s policy of supporting the British in their fight against the Nazis.\n\nStern rejected collaboration with the British, and claimed that only a continuing struggle against them would lead eventually to an independent Jewish state and resolve the Jewish situation in the Diaspora. The British White Paper of 1939 allowed only 75,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine over five years, and no more after that unless local Arabs gave their permission. But actually Stern’s opposition to British colonial rule in Palestine was not based on a particular policy; Stern defined the British Mandate as “foreign rule” regardless of their policies and took a radical position against such imperialism even if it were to be benevolent.\n\nStern was unpopular with the official Jewish establishment leaders of the Haganah and Jewish Agency and also those of the Irgun. His movement drew an eclectic crew of individuals, from all ends of the political spectrum, including people who became prominent such as Yitzhak Shamir, later an Israeli prime minister, who supported Jewish settlement throughout the land, and who opposed ceding territory to Arabs in negotiations; Natan Yellin-Mor who later became a leader of the peace movement in Israel advocating negotiations and accommodation with the Palestinians, and Israel Eldad, who after the underground war ended spent nearly 15 years writing tracts and articles promoting extreme right wing, nationalist brand of Zionism.\n\nStern began organizing his new underground army by focusing on four fronts: 1) publishing a newspaper and making clandestine radio broadcasts offering theoretical justifications for urban guerilla warfare; 2) obtaining funds for the underground, either by donations or by robbing British banks; 3) opening negotiations with foreign powers for the purpose of saving Europe’s Jews and developing allies in the struggle against the British in Palestine; 4) actual military-style operations against the British.\n\nNone of these projects went well for the new underground. Without money or a printing press the stenciled newspapers were few and hard to read. The bank robberies and operations against British policemen resulted in shootouts in the streets and both British and Jewish police were killed and injured. A British sting operation entrapped Stern into attempting to negotiate with the Italians and Germans, and this further tainted Lehi’s reputation.\n\nIn January 1941, Stern attempted to make an agreement with the German Nazi authorities, offering to \"actively take part in the war on Germany's side\" in return for German support for Jewish immigration to Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state. Another attempt to contact the Germans was made in late 1941, but there is no record of a German response in either case. These appeals to Germany were in direct opposition to the views of other Zionists, such as Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who wanted Britain to defeat the Nazis even as they wanted to expel the British from Palestine.\n\nWanted posters appeared all over the country with a price on Stern’s head. Stern wandered from safe house to safe house in Tel Aviv, carrying a collapsible cot in a suitcase. When he ran out of hiding places he slept in apartment house stairwells. Eventually he moved into a Tel Aviv apartment rented by Moshe and Tova Svorai, who were members of Lehi. Moshe Svorai was caught by British detectives who raided another apartment, where two Lehi members were shot dead, and Svorai and one other wounded were hospitalized. Stern’s Lehi “contact”, Hisia Shapiro, thought she might have been followed one morning and stopped bringing messages. On 12 February 1942 she came with one last message, from the Haganah, offering to house Stern for the duration of the war if he would give up his fight against the British. Stern gave Shapiro a letter in reply declining the safe haven and suggesting cooperation between Lehi and the Haganah in fighting the British. A couple of hours later British detectives arrived to search the apartment and discovered Stern hiding there. It was the mother of one of the \"Lehi\" members who inadvertently led the police to Stern's hiding place in Tel Aviv. Two neighbors were brought to attest to the propriety of the search. After they had left, Tova Svorai was also taken away so that Stern was alone with three armed policemen. Then, in circumstances that remain disputed today, Stern was shot dead.\n\nThe \"most secret\" report made by the police to the British mandatory government said, \"Stern was ... just finishing lacing his shoes when he suddenly leapt for the window opposite. He was half way out of the window when he was shot by two of the three policemen in the room.\" Assistant Superintendent Geoffrey J. Morton, the most senior policeman present, later wrote in his memoirs that he had feared Stern was about to set off an explosive device as he had previously threatened to do if captured.\n\nThe police version was dismissed by Stern's followers and many others, who believed that Stern had been shot in cold blood. Morton successfully sued four publishers of books which claimed he murdered Stern, including the English publisher of \"The Revolt\", which settled without consulting the author, Menachem Begin, who wanted to go to court. Lehi tried unsuccessfully to assassinate Morton at least three times. Binyamin Gepner, a former Lehi member who in 1980 interviewed another policeman Stewart who had been present at Stern's death, said that Stewart had effectively admitted Stern was murdered but later refused to repeat it. The policeman whose gun was trained on Stern until Morton arrived, Bernard Stamp, said in a 1986 interview broadcast on Israel Radio, that Morton's account was \"hogwash.\" According to Stamp, Morton pulled Stern from the couch on which he was sitting, \"sort of pushed him, spun him around, and Morton shot him.\" Stamp has been cited saying Stern was killed while unarmed with no chance of escape.\n\nTova Svorai recalled in a memoir:\n\n\"At about 9:30 there was a knock at the door, too gentle a tapping to signal the presence of the police. Yair…went into the closet, and only then did I open the door. At the door stood the 'good' detective Wilkins with two men behind him. Wilkins was always very polite, too polite perhaps. He asked me why I hadn't gone to visit my husband Moshe and if I weren't worried about him. I told him that if I had gone to the hospital I would have been arrested immediately. They searched my room…then they went downstairs and brought two neighbors, women, so they might have witnesses…they went over to the closet…one of the policemen opened it. Yair was nowhere to be seen. The policemen thrust his left hand into the closet and began searching, and when his hand came upon Yair he pulled him out. At the same time he put his right hand into his back pocket and took out his gun. I ran between him and Yair and said \"Don't shoot! If you shoot, you shoot me\"…. in my innocence I thought I had saved Yair's life…how wrong I was. They made him sit on the sofa…more detectives appeared, they had handcuffs and used them to bind Yair's hands behind his back….they told me to get dressed and go downstairs…I got into a small car…suddenly I heard three shots.\" \n\nHis son, Yair, born a few months after Stern's killing, is a veteran broadcast journalist and TV news anchor who once headed Israel Television.\n\nA memorial ceremony attended by Israeli politicians and government officials is held each year at Stern's grave in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Givatayim. In 1978, a postage stamp was issued in his honor. \n\nIn 1981, the town of Kochav Yair (Yair's Star) was founded and named after Stern's nickname.\n\nThe place \"where he was shot is a museum and place of pilgrimage for a growing number of hard-right youths\".\n\nIn January 2016, actor Steven Schub originated the role of Avraham 'Yair' Stern in the world premiere of historian Zev Golan's play \"The Ghosts of Mizrachi Bet Street\", based on the life of Avraham Stern directed by Leah Stoller and S. Kim Glassman at The Jerusalem Theatre in Israel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1858821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858821", "title": "Ayman Nour", "text": "Ayman Nour\n\nAyman Abd El Aziz Nour (, ; born 5 December 1964) is an Egyptian politician, a former member of the Egyptian Parliament, founder and chairman of the El Ghad party. He left Egypt following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, though he has stated he has gone to Lebanon for treatment of a wound he sustained while in prison and hopes to return to Egypt.\n\nNour was the first man to ever compete against former President Hosni Mubarak for the presidency of Egypt in 2005. He was the first runner-up in the 2005 presidential election with 7% of the vote according to government figures and estimated at 13% by independent observers, although no independent observers were allowed to monitor the elections. Shortly after placing a distant second, in what are widely believed to have been corrupt elections, he was imprisoned by Mubarak under allegations of \"forgery\" which have been widely criticized to have been politically motivated and corrupt charges. Nour was released on \"health grounds\" on 18 February 2009 only a few months before he would have completed his prison sentence. Following the fall of Mubarak in the 2011 Revolution, Nour intended to run for the now-vacant presidency, but was disqualified by the Presidential Election Commission.\n\nNour was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested on 29 January 2005. He was charged with forging PAs (Powers of Attorney) to secure the formation of the el-Ghad party. Nour vehemently denied the charges (from prison).\n\nThe arrest, occurring in an election year, was widely criticized by governments around the world as a step backwards for Egyptian democracy. Few seem to regard the charges as legitimate. Nour remained active despite his imprisonment, using the opportunity to write critical articles and make his case and cause better known.\n\nIn February 2005, Condoleezza Rice abruptly postponed a visit to Egypt, reflecting U.S. displeasure at the jailing of Nour, who was reported to have been brutally interrogated. That same month, the government announced the following month that it would open elections to multiple candidates.\n\nIn March 2005, following a strong intervention in Cairo by a group of Members of the European Parliament led by Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott (UK, Conservative), Nour was freed and began a campaign for the Egyptian presidency.\n\nOn 24 December 2005 he was sentenced to five years in jail. Though diabetic, Nour engaged in a two-weeks long hunger strike to protest his trial.\n\nNour's verdict and sentencing made global headlines and were the first item of news on most international news broadcasts, including the BBC.\n\nOn the day of Nour's guilty verdict and sentencing, the White House Press Secretary released the following statement denouncing the government's action:\nThe United States is deeply troubled by the conviction today of Egyptian politician Ayman Nour by an Egyptian court. The conviction of Mr. Nour, the runner-up in Egypt's 2005 presidential elections, calls into question Egypt's commitment to democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. We are also disturbed by reports that Mr. Nour's health has seriously declined due to the hunger strike on which he has embarked in protest of the conditions of his trial and detention.\nThe United States calls upon the Egyptian government to act under the laws of Egypt in the spirit of its professed desire for increased political openness and dialogue within Egyptian society, and out of humanitarian concern, to release Mr. Nour from detention.\n\nIn February 2006, Rice visited Mubarak yet never spoke Nour's name publicly. When asked about him at a news conference, she referred to his situation as one of Egypt's setbacks. Days later, Mubarak told a government newspaper that Rice \"didn't bring up difficult issues or ask to change anything.\" From prison, Nour stated \"I pay the price when [Rice] speaks [of me], and I pay the price when she doesn't,\" Nour said. \"But what's happening to me now is a message to everybody.\"\n\nIn June 2007 President Bush, speaking at a conference of dissidents in the Czech Republic, revisited the issue of Ayman Nour, saying:There are many dissidents who couldn't join us because they are being unjustly imprisoned or held under house arrest. I look forward to the day when a conference like this one include Alexander Kozulin of Belarus, Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, Oscar Elias Biscet of Cuba, Father Nguyen Van Ly of Vietnam, Ayman Nour of Egypt. (Applause.) The daughter of one of these political prisoners is in this room. I would like to say to her, and all the families: I thank you for your courage. I pray for your comfort and strength. And I call for the immediate and unconditional release of your loved ones.\nI have asked Secretary Rice to send a directive to every U.S. ambassador in an un-free nation: Seek out and meet with activists for democracy. Seek out those who demand human rights.\n\nNour was released on health grounds on 18 February 2009. It has been alleged that his release from prison was due to U.S. President Obama demanding his release as a condition to meet with Mubarak.\n\n\n"}

Along with his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, Barack Obama was opposed in the general election by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, along with various minor candidates from other parties. The election took place on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.\n\nObama's campaign headquarters was in Chicago and key members of his successful campaign in 2008, such as Jim Messina and David Axelrod, returned to staff it. On the day of the announcement, the campaign released a promotional video showing supporters of Obama organizing for the re-election effort. As \"The Guardian\" newspaper noted, this was the first U.S. presidential reelection campaign to use Facebook and Twitter for promotion.\n\nBetween early-2011 and June 30, 2012, the Obama campaign and supporters spent approximately $400 million, according to the Federal Election Commission. Obama won his reelection bid by a margin of 51.06 to 47.21%. This was the first time since 1944, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt won re-election, that a Democratic president had won by a majority of the electoral votes and over 51% of the popular vote twice.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th President of the United States. On April 4, 2011, President Obama officially announced his candidacy for re-election. The announcement was made via an online video titled \"It Begins With Us\", posted on his campaign website. The President also filled out official forms with the FEC at that time.\n\nPresident Obama did not face a significant challenge in the Democratic primaries, with no other candidate on the ballot in all but seven states. On April 3, 2012, Obama won the Maryland and District of Columbia primaries, giving him more than the required 2778 delegates to secure the nomination. On April 30, 2012 the campaign announced that its slogan would be \"Forward\".\n\nThe campaign was based in Chicago in One Prudential Plaza, instead of in Washington, D.C., where all other modern incumbent presidents have had their re-election headquarters. The decision to base the campaign outside of Washington was said have been taken so as to ensure grassroots support for re-election.\n\nThe campaign began accepting online donations on April 4, 2011, the day Obama announced his candidacy. In the first 24 hours after online donations began to be accepted, over 23,000 online donations of $200 or less were made. President Obama headlined his first campaign fundraiser in April 2011 in Chicago. He also headlined fundraisers in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in April 2011. On April 29, 2011, it was announced that Matthew Barzun, the United States Ambassador to Sweden, would serve as finance chairman. Many sources claim that the campaign may be the first campaign in U.S. history to raise more than one billion dollars. In March 2011, Campaign Chairman Jim Messina asked a group of 450 top donors to raise $350,000. During the second fundraising quarter of 2011 (the first of the campaign), the campaign raised a record amount of $86,000,000. As of May 3, 2012, Obama and his team have held 130 fundraisers.\n\nMore than 550,000 individuals donated towards the campaign in the second quarter of 2011, which is a much larger number than the 180,000 individuals who donated to Obama's 2008 campaign during the first half of 2007. From the beginning of the campaign to December 31, 2011, more than 1.3 million individual donated to the campaign. The LGBT community had donated a record amount so far to the campaign. As of March 31, 2012, the campaign had raised $191.7 million.\n\nOn May 10, 2012, Obama attended a fundraiser in the Los Angeles home of actor George Clooney, which raised over $15 million. The fundraiser was initially estimated to raise about $10 million, but after Obama's historic announcement of his support for same-sex marriage, the amount went up significantly. Many believed that the LGBT community and activists would donate historic amounts after the announcement.\n\nObama's campaign was also supported by Priorities USA Action, an independent expenditure PAC founded by several former Obama campaign officials, but legally prohibited from coordinating with the candidate or his campaign.\n\nThe engineering investment of the Obama 2012 campaign was unprecedented, under the leadership of CTO Harper Reed. Reed helped build a team of developers from tech companies like Twitter, Google, Facebook, Craigslist, Quora, Orbitz and Threadless. This approach— hiring technology workers from the tech startups rather than the political realm— was novel. A central component of that work was Project Narwhal, a centralized database of electoral information.\n\nDan Wagner served as Chief Analytics Officer, running the 54-person analytics team out of a windowless office known as the 'cave.' His teams predictions were remarkably accurate to the actual election results.\n\nThe Obama campaign was highly effective in getting out the vote, in using technology to identify voters, and in capitalizing on growing segments of the voting population.\n\n\"President Obama won reelection, not by going after independent voters, but by going after emerging groups in the U.S. population. By race, age and gender, voters made clear that America is made up of many parts, and the Obama team captured more of them, and delivered more of them to the polls.\"\n\nThe bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) held four debates for the 2012 U.S. presidential general election, slated for various locations around the United States in October 2012 – three of them involving the major party presidential nominees (later determined to be Democratic President Barack Obama from Illinois and former Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts), and one involving the vice-presidential nominees (Vice President Joe Biden from Delaware and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin).\n\nHurricane Sandy affected the presidential campaign as well as local and state campaigns in storm-damaged areas, as it hit the New England coast a week before the election. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, one of Mitt Romney's leading supporters, praised President Barack Obama and his reaction to the hurricane and toured storm-damaged areas of his state with the president. Obama signed emergency declarations on October 28 for several states expected to be impacted by Sandy, allowing them to request federal aid and make additional preparations in advance of the storm. According to Karl Rove and Bill Clinton, the hurricane and its aftermath ended up helping Obama; the hurricane drew attention away from the campaigns and Obama was able to take a bipartisan position and be \"presidential\". The event sparked debates and discussions on climate change, which had been ignored by both parties prior to the event.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Obama was re-elected for his second term as President of the United States. He won 65,899,660 popular votes and 332 electoral votes, with two states less than in his 2008 victory. In his victory speech in Chicago, he promised to \"sit down with\" Mitt Romney to discuss a bipartisan future for the United States.\n\nMany key people from the successful 2008 campaign returned. David Axelrod, who was in charge of Media in 2008 and who worked in the White House as a Senior Advisor to the President from 2009 until 2011, returned to Chicago to work on the campaign as the top communications official. Jim Messina, who worked in the White House as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations from 2009 until 2011, moved to Chicago to serve as campaign manager. Matthew Barzun, the United States Ambassador to Sweden, served as finance chairman. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked at the Democratic National Committee as an executive director, was named deputy campaign manager. The other deputy campaign manager was Julianna Smoot, who was the 2008 finance director and was briefly the White House Social Secretary. Ben LaBolt served as national press secretary. LaBolt worked for Sherrod Brown's 2006 Senate campaign, as Obama's senate press secretary, for the 2008 campaign, as a deputy White House Press Secretary, and for Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel, Katie Hogan and Adam Fetcher, who each worked on the 2008 campaign, served as deputy press secretaries. Rahm Emanuel was expected to play a role in the campaign. Emanuel served as White House Chief of Staff from January 2009 until October 2010 and worked on President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 and 1996 campaigns. Rufus Gifford served as Finance Director, Elizabeth Lowery served as Deputy Finance Director, Jeremy Bird served as National Field Director, Marlon Marshall served as Deputy National Field Director, Mitch Stewart served as battleground state Director, and Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean served as Research Director. Katherine Archuleta was named political director.\n\nIn February 2012, Obama for America (OFA) announced its list of campaign co-chairs: \n\n\nIn a March 2011 Pew poll, Obama held an advantage of 47% to 37%, similar to the lead that former President George W. Bush held over an unnamed Democrat in 2003 and larger than the lead former President Bill Clinton held over an unnamed Republican in 1995. An August 2011 Rasmussen poll found that in a hypothetical race between President Obama and a generic Republican, 48% backed the generic Republican and 40% backed the President.\n\nIn February 2012, Obama held a sizable lead over both Mitt Romney (53–43) and Rick Santorum (53–42) nationally. By the end of March 2012, Obama's lead over Romney had narrowed to approximately 2.4% (46.6–44.2) nationally. An August 2012 CNN/ORC poll found that Obama led Romney 52% to 45%. A Fox News poll conducted nearly the same time placed the two candidates 49% to 40%, with Obama in the lead.\n\n\n"}

He is best remembered today as the author of the \"Commentary on the Apocalypse\".\n\nBeatus was likely born and raised in Liébana, possibly from a poor family. As confessor to Queen Adosinda, wife of Silo of Asturias, and as teacher of Alcuin of York and Etherius of Osma, Beatus exercised wide influence.\n\nHe is best remembered today as the author of the \"Commentary on the Apocalypse\", written in 776, then revised in 784 and again in 786. The \"Commentary\" was popular during the Middle Ages and survives in at least 34 manuscripts (usually called a \"beatus\") from the 10th through the 16th centuries. Not all of the manuscripts are complete, and some exist only in fragmentary form. Twenty-six of these manuscripts are lavishly decorated in the Mozarabic, Romanesque, or Gothic style of illumination.\n\nBeatus was a strong opponent of the Adoptionist Christology put forward by Elipandus, Bishop of Toledo and founder of the Adoptivi, and Bishop Felix of Urgell in the Iberian Peninsula. Elipandus and Felix declared that Jesus, in respect to his human nature, was the adopted son of God by God's grace, thus emphasizing the distinction between the divinity and the humanity of Christ. Beatus and other opponents of adoptionism, such as Alcuin and Paulinus II of Aquileia, feared that this view would so divide the person of the Savior that the reality of the incarnation would be lost. In addition, many theologians were concerned that this adoptionism was a new version of the Nestorianism advanced by Nestorius. This debate largely died with the deaths of the proponents.\n\nThe \"Commentary on the Apocalypse\" is a work of erudition but without great originality, made up principally of compilations. Beatus includes long extracts from the texts of the Fathers of the Church and Doctors of the Church, especially Augustine of Hippo, Ambrose, Ticonius, Irenaeus, and Isidore of Seville. He adds to this the commentary on the Book of Daniel by Jerome.\n\nThe Beatus text was regarded as a symbol of Christian resistance to the Muslims who dominated much of the Iberian Peninsula (see al-Andalus) in the early Middle Ages.\n\nFor more information on Beatus of Liébana or on the Beatus Apocalypse manuscripts, see the studies carried out by John Williams, Mireille Mentre, José Camón Aznar, Wilhelm Neuss and Joaquín Yarza Luaces.\n\n\n"}

The Dorian city-state of Megara, near Athens, was also searching for sites to set up yet another colony. After asking the oracle of Delphi, the Megarean king Nisos sent his son Byzas in search of \"the land opposite the city of the blind\".\n\nWhen Byzas arrived to where the Sea of Marmaras meets the Sea of Bosporos, on the border of Europe and Asia, he realized the meaning of the oracle. On the Asian shore, opposite to where he was, a colony, Chalcedon, had already been established. Byzas decided that Chalcedon was the prophesied 'city of the blind', as it had not taken advantage of the European shore.\n\nTo build his new city, in 667 BC Byzas chose wisely. He selected the European shore of the south end of Bosporos and gave the new city his name, Byzantion.\nLater, Byzas married Fidalea, daughter of king Varvizos (or Varvisios) of Thrace. The inhabitants of ancient Byzantion considered Byzas as their founder and, according to ancient sources, honoured him by raising a statue of Byzas and his wife, Fidalea, in a noticeable place in the city.\n\nThe ancients had a very good understanding of the advantages that Byzantion had over Chalcedon, as the colony of Byzantion commanded the entrance to two seas, the entrance to both the Black Sea, through Sea of Bosporos, and the Aegean Sea, through the Sea of Marmaras (Propondis was is its ancient name).\n\nApart from the story of the Pythian oracle of Apollonian Delphi, as described by the Greek geographer and historian Strabo (63 BC - 23 AD) and by the Roman historian Tacitus (1st century AD), there are other versions of the maxim referring to the \"blind people\". The Greek historian Herodotos (5th century BC) wrote that when the Persian general Megabazos arrived at Byzantium, he called the people of Chalcedon blind because although they had a choice of sites, they chose the worse one.\n\n"}

She and her family were visiting friends for afternoon tea and went shopping for cake. She and her mother were run over by a driver who failed to see them, due to a large truck that obscured his vision of them, and their vision of his car. Her mother died immediately. Darvall sustained a skull fracture and severe head injuries, after the car flung her across the road and her head hit the wheel cap of her own car. She could not stay alive without life support, and was essentially brain dead. At 9 p.m. on the day of the accident, the resuscitation team stopped trying to revive her.\n\nEdward Darvall arranged for his fourteen-year son, who had witnessed the accident, to be taken away from the hospital. The 66-year-old Edward was also given a sedative, and he waited while doctors attempted to save his daughter. Two doctors, Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman, informed him that there was nothing further they could do for Denise. Bosman explained that there was a man in the hospital they might be able to help, and asked Edward if he would consider allowing them to transplant Denise's heart.\nEdward Darwal later said that he only thought about his daughter for four minutes, he took him to reach his decision, and gave his permission.\n\nThe public record shows that Edward Darvall mostly shunned publicity. He had undergone major stomach surgery, but his strength of character and dignity earned him many admirers. Before the joint funeral of his wife and daughter, he asked for donations to be sent to the Groote Schuur cardiac unit.\n\nDarvall was present at the trial of the drunk driver who was convicted guilty of murder. Darvall, heartbroken, made a statement through a lawyer, asking the magistrate to show the “greatest possible mercy” to the driver. \"The tragic death of his daughter was not meaningless, but benefited humanity,\" he said..\n\nSurgeons had a serious ethical problem because death then could only be declared by whole-body standards. The Harvard Criteria of Brain Death was not developed until 1968, nor was it adopted in South Africa or elsewhere for some years. The problem in this case was that, although Denise's brain was damaged, her heart was healthy. Various reports over the years attributed conflicting reasons for her heart stopping. For forty years, Barnard's brother Marius kept a secret: that rather than wait for her heart to stop beating, at Marius’s urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into Denise’s heart to paralyze it and thus, to render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.\n\nAfter her father gave his consent, Darvall's heart was donated to Louis Washkansky. Her kidneys were given to 10-year-old Jonathan van Wyk. Due to apartheid, the kidney donation to Van Wyk was controversial because he was black, while Denise was white. Washkansky would only live for another 18 days, succumbing to pneumonia.\n\n\n\n"}

He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriting partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive number one albums in the U.S., 58 \"Billboard\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four which reached number two and nine which reached number one. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and U.S. singles charts. He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films.\n\nRaised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology. John met his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, in 1967, after they had both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years they wrote songs for other artists, including Lulu, and John also worked as a session musician for artists such as the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969 his debut album, \"Empty Sky\", was released. In 1970. John's first hit single \"Your Song\", from his second album, \"Elton John\", reached the top ten in the UK and the U.S. After decades of chart success, John has also achieved success in musical films and theatre, composing the music for \"The Lion King\" and its stage adaptation, \"Aida\" and \"Billy Elliot the Musical\".\n\nHe has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards – winning two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the first Brits Icon in 2013 for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him Number 49 on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, \"Billboard\" ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists (third overall behind the Beatles and Madonna). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.\n\nHe has been heavily involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and a year later began hosting the annual Academy Award Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over . John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005, and after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014, wed Furnish on 21 December 2014. On 24 January 2018, it was announced that John would be retiring from touring and would soon embark on a three-year farewell tour, which began in September 2018.\n\nElton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on 25 March 1947, in Pinner, Middlesex, the eldest child of Stanley Dwight (1925–1991) and only child of Sheila Eileen (née Harris; 1925–2017), and was raised in a council house by his maternal grandparents, in Pinner. His parents married in 1945, when the family moved to a nearby semi-detached house. He was educated at Pinner Wood Junior School, Reddiford School and Pinner County Grammar School, until the age of 17, when he left just prior to his A-Level examinations to pursue a career in the music industry.\n\nWhen he began to consider a career in music seriously, Elton John's father, who served as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking. John has stated that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after such a restrictive childhood. Both of John's parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances. The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day, and John remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by Elvis Presley and Bill Haley & His Comets in 1956.\n\nElton John started playing his grandmother's piano as a young boy and within a year, his mother heard him picking out Winifred Atwell's \"The Skater's Waltz\" by ear. After performing at parties and family gatherings, at the age of 7 he took up formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies, and gained some notoriety by playing like Jerry Lee Lewis at school functions. At the age of 11, he won a junior scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a \"gramophone record\", a four-page piece by George Frideric Handel that he heard for the first time.\n\nFor the next five years, he attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and has stated that he enjoyed playing Frédéric Chopin and Johann Sebastian Bach and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student. \"I kind of resented going to the Academy\", he says. \"I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades.\" He has claimed that he would sometimes skip classes and ride around on the London Underground. Several instructors have testified that he was a \"model student\", and during the last few years, he was taking lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.\n\nElton John's mother, though also strict with her son, was more vivacious than her husband, and something of a free spirit. With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often physically absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother. When his father was home, the Dwights would have terrible arguments that greatly distressed their son. When John was 14, they divorced. His mother then married a local painter, Fred Farebrother, a caring and supportive stepfather whom John affectionately referred to as \"Derf\", his first name in reverse. They moved into flat No. 1A in an eight-unit apartment building called Frome Court, not far from both previous homes. It was there that John wrote the songs that launched his career as a rock star; he lived there until he had four albums simultaneously in the American Top 40.\n\nAt the age of 15, with the help of his mother and stepfather, Reginald Dwight became a weekend pianist at a nearby pub, the Northwood Hills Hotel, playing Thursday to Sunday nights. Known simply as \"Reggie\", he played a range of popular standards, including songs by Jim Reeves and Ray Charles, as well as songs he had written himself. A stint with a short-lived group called the Corvettes rounded out his time.\n\nIn 1962, Dwight and his friends formed a band called Bluesology. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&B musicians like the Isley Brothers, Major Lance and Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry's supporting band, and played 16 times at the Marquee Club.\nIn 1967, Dwight answered an advertisement in the British magazine \"New Musical Express\", placed by Ray Williams, then the A&R manager for Liberty Records. At their first meeting, Williams gave Dwight an unopened envelope of lyrics written by Bernie Taupin, who had answered the same ad. Dwight wrote music for the lyrics, and then posted it to Taupin, beginning a partnership that . When the two first met in 1967, they recorded what would become the first Elton John/Bernie Taupin song: \"Scarecrow\". Six months later Dwight was going by the name \"Elton John\" in homage to two members of Bluesology: saxophonist Elton Dean and vocalist Long John Baldry. His name was legally changed to Elton Hercules John on 7 January 1972.\n\nThe team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin joined Dick James's DJM Records as staff songwriters in 1968, and over the next two years wrote material for various artists, among them Roger Cook and Lulu. Taupin would write a batch of lyrics in under an hour and give it to John, who would write music for them in half an hour, disposing of the lyrics if he could not come up with anything quickly. For two years, they wrote easy-listening tunes for James to peddle to singers. Their early output included a contender for the UK entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1969, for Lulu, called \"I Can't Go On (Living Without You)\". It came sixth of six songs. In 1969, John provided piano for Roger Hodgson on his first released single, \"Mr. Boyd\" by Argosy, a quartet that was completed by Caleb Quaye and Nigel Olsson.\n\nOn the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin started writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single \"I've Been Loving You\" (1968), produced by Caleb Quaye, Bluesology's former guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, \"Lady Samantha\", and an album, \"Empty Sky\". For their follow-up album, \"Elton John\", John and Taupin enlisted Gus Dudgeon as producer and Paul Buckmaster as musical arranger. \"Elton John\" was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/Pye Records in the UK and Uni Records in the US, and established the formula for subsequent albums – gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The album's first single, \"Border Song\", peaked at 92 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The second single, \"Your Song\", reached number seven in the UK Singles Chart and number eight in the US, becoming John's first hit single as a singer. The album soon became his first hit album, reaching number four on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and number five on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nBacked by former Spencer Davis Group drummer Nigel Olsson and bassist Dee Murray, Elton John's first American concert took place at the Troubadour in Los Angeles in August 1970, and was a success. The concept album \"Tumbleweed Connection\" was released in October 1970, and reached number two in the UK and number five in the U.S. The live album \"17-11-70\" (titled \"11–17–70\" in the U.S.) was recorded at a live show aired from A&R Studios on WABC-FM in New York City. Sales of the live album were heavily hit in the US when an east-coast bootlegger released the performance several weeks before the official album, including all 60 minutes of the aircast, not just the 40 minutes selected by Dick James Music.\nJohn and Taupin then wrote the soundtrack to the obscure film \"Friends\" and then the album \"Madman Across the Water\", the latter reaching number eight in the U.S. and producing the hit songs, \"Levon\", and the album's opening track \"Tiny Dancer\". In 1972, Davey Johnstone joined the Elton John Band on guitar and backing vocals. Released in 1972, \"Honky Château\" became John's first U.S. number one album, spending five weeks at the top of the \"Billboard\" 200, and began a streak of seven consecutive U.S. number-one albums. The album reached number two in the UK, and spawned the hit singles \"Rocket Man\" and \"Honky Cat\".\n\nThe pop album \"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player\" came out at the start of 1973 and reached number one in the UK, the U.S. and Australia, among other countries. The album produced the hits \"Crocodile Rock\", his first US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one, and \"Daniel\", which reached number two in the U.S. and number four in the UK. Both the album and \"Crocodile Rock\" were the first album and single, respectively on the consolidated MCA Records label in the U.S., replacing MCA's other labels including Uni.\n\n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", released in October 1973, gained instant critical acclaim and topped the chart on both sides of the Atlantic, remaining at number one for two months. It also temporarily established John as a glam rock star. It contained the U.S. number 1 \"Bennie and the Jets\", along with other hits, \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", \"Candle in the Wind\", \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" and \"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\". \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" is included in the VH1 Classic Albums series, discussing the making, recording, and popularity of the album through concert and home video footage including interviews.\n\nJohn formed his own label named The Rocket Record Company (distributed in the US by MCA and initially by Island in the UK) and signed acts to it – notably Neil Sedaka (John sang background vocals on Sedaka's \"Bad Blood\") and Kiki Dee, in whom he took a personal interest. Instead of releasing his own records on Rocket, he opted for a $8 million contract offered by MCA. When the contract was signed in 1974, MCA reportedly took out a $25 million insurance policy on John's life. In 1974, MCA released \"Elton John's Greatest Hits\", a UK and U.S. number one which is certified Diamond by the RIAA for sales of 16million copies in the U.S.\n\nIn 1974, John collaborated with John Lennon on his cover of the Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", the B-side of which was Lennon's \"One Day at a Time.\" In return, John was featured on \"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\" on Lennon's \"Walls and Bridges\" album. Later that year, in what would be Lennon's last major live performance, the pair performed these two number 1 hits, along with the Beatles' \"I Saw Her Standing There\", at Madison Square Garden in New York. Lennon made the rare stage appearance with John and his band to keep the promise he had made that he would appear on stage with him if \"Whatever Gets You Thru The Night\" became a U.S. number one single.\n\n\"Caribou\" was released in 1974, becoming John's third number one in the UK, and topping the charts in the U.S., Canada and Australia. Reportedly recorded in two weeks between live appearances, it featured \"The Bitch Is Back\" and the orchestrated \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\". \"Step into Christmas\" was released as a stand-alone single in November 1973, and appears in the album's 1995 remastered re-issue.\nPete Townshend of the Who asked John to play a character called the \"Local Lad\" in the film adaptation of the rock opera \"Tommy\", and to perform the song \"Pinball Wizard\". Drawing on power chords, John's version was recorded and used for the movie release in 1975. The song charted at number 7 in the UK. Bally subsequently released a \"Captain Fantastic\" pinball machine featuring an illustration of John in his movie guise.\n\nThe 1975 autobiographical album \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\" debuted at number one in the U.S., the first album ever to do so, and stayed at the top for seven weeks. Elton John revealed his previously ambiguous personality on the album, with Taupin's lyrics describing their early days as struggling songwriters and musicians in London. The lyrics and accompanying photo booklet are infused with a specific sense of place and time that is otherwise rare in his music. \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" was the hit single from this album and captured an early turning point in John's life. The album's release signalled the end of the Elton John Band, as an unhappy and overworked John dismissed Olsson and Murray, two people who had contributed much of the band's signature sound and who had helped build his live following since the beginning.\n\nAccording to \"Circus\", a spokesman for John Reid said the decision was reached mutually via phone while John was in Australia promoting \"Tommy\". She said there was no way Reid could have fired them \"because the band are not employed by John Reid, they're employed by Elton John.\" She went on to say Nigel would be going back to his solo work and Dee would do session work \"and possibly cut a solo album\".\n\nDavey Johnstone and Ray Cooper were retained, Quaye and Roger Pope returned, and the new bassist was Kenny Passarelli: this rhythm section provided a heavier-sounding backbeat. James Newton Howard joined to arrange in the studio and to play keyboards. In June 1975, John introduced the line-up before a crowd of 75,000 in London's Wembley Stadium.\nThe rock-orientated \"Rock of the Westies\" entered the U.S. albums chart at number 1 as had \"Captain Fantastic\", a previously unattained feat. Elton John's stage wardrobe now included ostrich feathers, $5,000 spectacles that spelled his name in lights, and dressing up like the Statue of Liberty, Donald Duck, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, among other figures. In 1975, John received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nTo celebrate five years since he had first appeared at the venue, in 1975 Elton John played a two-night, four-show stand at the Troubadour. With seating limited to under 500 per show, the chance to purchase tickets was determined by a postcard lottery, with each winner allowed two tickets. Everyone who attended the performances received a hardbound \"yearbook\" of the band's history. That year he also played piano on Kevin Ayers' \"Sweet Deceiver\", and was among the first and few white artists to appear on the African-American television series \"Soul Train\". On 9 August 1975, John was named the outstanding rock personality of the year at the first annual Rock Music Awards at ceremonies held in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn 1976, the live album \"Here and There\" was released in May, followed by the \"Blue Moves\" album in October, which contained the single \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\". His biggest success in 1976 was \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", a duet with Kiki Dee that topped both the UK and U.S. charts.\nBesides being the most commercially successful period, 1970–1976 is also held in the most regard critically. Within only a three-year span, between 1972 and 1975 John saw seven consecutive albums reach number one in the U.S., something which had not been accomplished before. Of the six Elton John albums to make \"Rolling Stone\"s list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003, all are from this period, with \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" ranked highest at number 91.\n\nIn November 1977, Elton John announced he was retiring from performing; Taupin began collaborating with others. Now producing only one album a year, John issued \"A Single Man\" in 1978, employing a new lyricist, Gary Osborne; the album produced no singles that made the top 20 in the U.S. but the two singles from the album released in the UK, \"Part-Time Love\" and \"Song for Guy\", both made the top 20 in the UK, with the latter reaching the top 5. In 1979, accompanied by Ray Cooper, Elton John became one of the first Western artists to tour the Soviet Union, as well as one of the first in Israel. John returned to the U.S. top ten with \"Mama Can't Buy You Love\" (number 9), a song originally rejected in 1977 by MCA before being released, recorded in 1977 with Philadelphia soul producer Thom Bell. John reported that Thom Bell was the first person to give him voice lessons; Bell encouraged John to sing in a lower register. A disco-influenced album, \"Victim of Love\", was poorly received. In 1979, John and Taupin reunited, though they did not collaborate on a full album until 1983's \"Too Low For Zero\". \"21 at 33\", released the following year, was a significant career boost, aided by his biggest hit in four years, \"Little Jeannie\" (number 3 US), with the lyrics written by Gary Osborne.\n\nHis 1981 album, \"The Fox\", was recorded during the same sessions as \"21 at 33\", and included collaborations with Tom Robinson and Judie Tzuke. On 13 September 1980, Elton John, with Olsson and Murray back in the Elton John Band, performed a free concert to an estimated 400,000 fans on The Great Lawn in Central Park in New York.\n\nWith original band members Johnstone, Murray and Olsson together again, he was able to return to the charts with the 1983 hit album \"Too Low for Zero\", which included \"I'm Still Standing\" (No. 4 UK) and \"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\", the latter of which featured Stevie Wonder on harmonica and reached number four in the U.S. and number five in the UK. In October 1983, John caused controversy when he broke the United Nations' cultural boycott on apartheid-era South Africa by performing at the Sun City venue. He married his close friend and sound engineer, Renate Blauel, on Valentine's Day 1984 – the marriage lasted three years.\n\nIn 1985, he was one of the many performers at Live Aid held at Wembley Stadium. John played \"Bennie and the Jets\" and \"Rocket Man\"; then \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" with Kiki Dee for the first time since the Hammersmith Odeon on 24 December 1982; and introduced George Michael, still then of Wham!, to sing \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\". In 1984, he released \"Breaking Hearts\" which featured the song \"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\", number five in the U.S. and number seven in the UK. Elton John also recorded material with Millie Jackson in 1985. In 1986, he played the piano on two tracks on the heavy metal band Saxon's album \"Rock the Nations\".\n\nIn 1987, John won a libel case against \"The Sun\" which published false allegations of him having sex with rent boys. In 1988, he performed five sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York, giving him 26 for his career. Netting over $20 million, 2,000 items of John's memorabilia were auctioned off at Sotheby's in London.\n\nHe placed other hits throughout the 1980s, including \"Nikita\", whose music video was directed by Ken Russell. The song reached number three in the UK and number seven in the U.S. In 1986, a live orchestral version of \"Candle in the Wind\" reached number six in the U.S., while \"I Don't Wanna Go on with You Like That\" reached number two in the same country in 1988. His highest-charting single was a collaboration with Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight, and Stevie Wonder called \"That's What Friends Are For\". The track reached number one in the U.S. in 1985; credited as Dionne and Friends, the song raised funds for AIDS research. His albums continued to sell, but of those released in the latter half of the 1980s, only \"Reg Strikes Back\" (number 16, 1988) placed in the top 20 in the U.S.\n\nIn 1990, he achieved his first solo U.K. number one hit single, with \"Sacrifice\" (coupled with \"Healing Hands\") from the previous year's album \"Sleeping with the Past\"; it stayed at the top spot for six weeks. The following year, John's \"Basque\" won the Grammy for Best Instrumental, and a guest concert appearance at Wembley Arena he had made on George Michael's cover of \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" was released as a single and topped the charts in both the U.K. and the U.S. At the 1991 Brit Awards in London, Elton John won the award for Best British Male.\n\nIn 1992, he released the U.S. number 8 album \"The One\", featuring the hit song \"The One\". He also released \"Runaway Train\", a duet he recorded with his long-time friend Eric Clapton, and with whom he played on Clapton's World Tour. John and Taupin then signed a music publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music for an estimated $39 million over twelve years, giving them the largest cash advance in music publishing history. In April 1992, John appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium, performing \"The Show Must Go On\" with the remaining members of Queen, and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses and Queen's remaining members. In September, John performed \"The One\" at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, and closed the ceremony performing \"November Rain\" with Guns N' Roses. The following year, he released \"Duets\", which featured collaborations with fifteen artists including Tammy Wynette and RuPaul. This included a new collaboration with Kiki Dee, entitled \"True Love\", which reached the Top 10 of the U.K. charts.\nIn the same year, \"The Bunbury Tails\", a multi-artist charity album, was released, which was the soundtrack to the British animated television series of the same name. \"Up The Revolution\" was John's track, alongside contributions from George Harrison, the Bee Gees and Eric Clapton. The album was issued briefly, and only in the U.K.\nAlong with Tim Rice, Elton John wrote the songs for the 1994 Disney animated film \"The Lion King\". At the 67th Academy Awards, three of the five nominees for the Academy Award for Best Song were from \"The Lion King\" soundtrack. John won the award with \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\". Both that and \"Circle of Life\" became hit songs for John. \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" also won John the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards. After the release of \"The Lion King\" soundtrack, the album remained at the top of \"Billboard\" 200 for nine weeks. On 10 November 1999, the RIAA certified \"The Lion King\" \"Diamond\" for selling 15million copies.\n\nIn 1994, Elton John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Guns N' Roses' frontman Axl Rose. In 1995, he released the album \"Made in England\" (number 3).\nThe title track is an autobiographical telling of parts of his life and what it is like in England. The album also featured the single \"Believe\". John performed \"Believe\" at the 1995 Brit Awards, and picked up the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nA duet with Luciano Pavarotti, \"Live Like Horses\", reached number nine in the U.K. in December 1996. A compilation album called \"Love Songs\" was released in 1996. Early in 1997, he held a 50th birthday party, costumed as Louis XIV of France, for five hundred friends. He performed with the surviving members of Queen in Paris at the opening night (17 January 1997) of \"Le Presbytère N'a Rien Perdu De Son Charme Ni Le Jardin De Son Éclat\", a work by French ballet legend Maurice Béjart which draws upon the AIDS crisis and the deaths of Freddie Mercury and the company's principal dancer Jorge Donn. Later in 1997, two close friends died: designer Gianni Versace was murdered; and Diana, Princess of Wales died in a Paris car crash on 31 August.\n\nIn early September, he contacted his writing partner Bernie Taupin, asking him to revise the lyrics of his 1973 song \"Candle in the Wind\" to honour Diana, and Taupin rewrote the song accordingly. On 6 September 1997, John performed \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" for the only time in a live setting at the funeral of Diana in Westminster Abbey. The song became the fastest and biggest-selling single of all time, eventually selling over 33million copies worldwide, the best-selling single in U.K. chart history, the best-selling single in \"Billboard\" history and the first single certified Diamond in the U.S. where it sold over 11million copies. The \"Guinness World Records\" 2009 states that the song is \"the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33million copies\". The song proceeds of approximately £55million were donated to Diana's charities via the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. It won Elton John the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in 1998. The song “Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" was released as a double A-side.\n\nOn 15 September 1997, John appeared at the \"Music for Montserrat\" charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, performing \"Your Song\", \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" and \"Live Like Horses\" solo before finishing with \"Hey Jude\" alongside fellow English artists Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Mark Knopfler and Sting. In November 1997, John performed in the BBC's Children in Need charity single \"Perfect Day\", which reached number one in the UK.\n\nIn the musical theatre world, \"The Lion King\" musical debuted on Broadway in 1997 and the West End in 1999. In 2014, it had grossed over $6 billion and became the top-earning title in box-office history for both stage productions and films, surpassing the record previously held by Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\". In addition to \"The Lion King\", John also composed music for a Disney's musical production \"Aida\" in 1999 with lyricist Tim Rice, for which they received the Tony Award for Best Original Score at the 54th Tony Awards, and the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The musical was given its world premiere in the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta and went on to Chicago and eventually Broadway. John released a live compilation album called \"Elton John One Night Only – The Greatest Hits\", featuring sings from the show he did at Madison Square Garden in New York City that same year. A concept album of songs from the musical \"Aida\" titled \"Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida\" was also released and featured the John duets \"Written in the Stars\" with LeAnn Rimes, and \"I Know the Truth\" with Janet Jackson.\n\nAt this point, John disliked appearing in his own music videos; the video for \"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\" featured Justin Timberlake portraying a young Elton John, and the video for \"I Want Love\" featured Robert Downey, Jr. lip-syncing the song. One month after the 11 September attacks, Elton John appeared at the Concert for New York City, performing \"I Want Love\" as well as \"Your Song\" as a duet with Billy Joel.\n\nIn August 2003, he scored his fifth UK number one single when \"Are You Ready for Love\" topped the charts. Returning to musical theatre, John composed music for a West End production of \"Billy Elliot the Musical\" in 2005 with playwright Lee Hall. Opening to strong reviews, the show won four Laurence Olivier Awards, including Best New Musical. The eleventh longest-running musical in West End history, the London production ran through April 2016, after 4,566 performances. \"Billy Elliot\" has been seen by over 5.25 million people in London and nearly 11 million people worldwide (on Broadway, in Sydney, Melbourne, Chicago, Toronto, Seoul, the Netherlands and São Paulo, Brazil etc.), has grossed over $800 million worldwide and is the winner of over 80 theatre awards internationally. His only theatrical project with Bernie Taupin is \"Lestat: The Musical\", based on Anne Rice's vampire novels. It received negative reviews from critics and closed in May 2006 after 39 performances. John featured on rapper Tupac Shakur's posthumous single \"Ghetto Gospel\", which topped the UK charts in July 2005.\n\nIn October 2003, he announced that he had signed an exclusive agreement to perform 75 shows over three years at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. The show, entitled \"The Red Piano\", was a multimedia concert featuring massive props and video montages created by David LaChapelle. Effectively, he and Celine Dion shared performances at Caesars Palace throughout the year – while one would perform, the other would rest. The first of these shows took place on 13 February 2004. In February 2006, John and Dion sang together at the venue to raise money for Harrah's Entertainment Inc. workers affected by the 2005 hurricanes, performing \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" and \"Saturday Night's Alright (for Fighting).\"\n\nElton John was named a Disney Legend for his contributions to Disney's films and theatrical works on 9 October 2006, by the Walt Disney Company. In 2006, he told \"Rolling Stone\" that he plans for his next record to be in the R&B and hip hop genre. John said \"I want to work with Pharrell Williams, Timbaland, Snoop [Dogg], Kanye [West], Eminem and just see what happens.\"\n\nIn March 2007, he performed at Madison Square Garden for a record-breaking 60th time for his 60th birthday; the concert was broadcast live and a DVD recording was released as \"Elton 60 – Live at Madison Square Garden\"; a greatest-hits compilation CD, \"Rocket Man – Number Ones\", was released in 17 different versions worldwide, including a CD/DVD combo; and his back catalogue – almost 500 songs from 32 albums – became available for legal paid download.\n\nOn 1 July 2007, John appeared at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales on what would have been her 46th birthday, with the proceeds from the concert going to Diana's charities as well as to charities of which her sons Prince William and Prince Harry are patrons. John opened the concert with \"Your Song\", and then later closed it with \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\", \"Tiny Dancer\", and \"Are You Ready For Love\".\n\nOn 21 June 2008, he performed his 200th show in Caesars Palace. A DVD/CD package of \"The Red Piano\" was released through Best Buy in November 2008. A two-year global tour was sandwiched between commitments in Las Vegas, Nevada, some of the venues of which were new to John. The Red Piano Tour closed in Las Vegas in April 2009. In a September 2008 interview with \"GQ\", John said: \"I'm going on the road again with Billy Joel again next year\", referring to \"Face to Face\", a series of concerts featuring both musicians. The tour began in March.\n\nIn 2009, John accepted Jerry Cantrell's invitation to collaborate with his band Alice in Chains. John played the piano in the song \"Black Gives Way to Blue\", a tribute to the band's late lead singer, Layne Staley, which was the title track and closing song in the album \"Black Gives Way to Blue\", released in September 2009. The first concert that Staley attended was Elton John's, and his mother revealed that he was blown away by it, with Cantrell adding: \"Elton is a very important musical influence to all of us in varying degrees, and especially to me. My first album was \"Elton John’s Greatest Hits\". And actually, we were reminded by Layne's stepfather that Elton was his first concert, so it was all really appropriate. So I wrote [Elton] an e-mail and explained what his music meant to us, and that this song was for Layne. We sent him a demo, and he said it was beautiful and he’d love to play on it. In the studio he was really relaxed and gracious, and he's got a great sense of humor. We were just trying to be cool: 'Oh, yeah, no big deal.' But we were excited. [Drummer Sean Kinney] and I had to walk out a couple of times to smoke cigarettes, like, 'Holy shit, this is killer.' It's one of those highlights you can't expect in life, and you're lucky to get them once in a while. And that is one.\" Elton revealed that he's been a big admirer of Cantrell for quite some time and couldn't resist the offer. He said, \"I was kind of surprised that Alice in Chains would ask me to do anything. I never thought I’d play on an Alice in Chains record. When I heard the song I really wanted to do it. I liked the fact that it was so beautiful and very simple. They had a great idea of what they wanted me to do on it and it turned out great.\"\n\nElton John performed a piano duet with Lady Gaga at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. On 6 June 2010, John performed at the fourth wedding of conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh for a reported $1 million fee. Eleven days later, and 17 years to the day after his previous performance in Israel, he performed at the Ramat Gan Stadium; this was significant because of other then-recent cancellations by other performers in the fallout surrounding an Israeli raid on Gaza Flotilla the month before. In his introduction to that concert, Elton John noted he and other musicians should not \"cherry-pick our conscience\", in reference to Elvis Costello, who was to have performed in Israel two weeks after John did, but cancelled in the wake of the aforementioned raid, citing his conscience.\n\nHe released \"The Union\" on 19 October 2010. John says the album, a collaboration with American singer, songwriter and sideman Leon Russell marks a new chapter in his recording career, saying: \"I don't have to make pop records any more.\" He began his new show The Million Dollar Piano at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas on 28 September 2011. John performed the show at Caesars for the next three years. He performed his 3000th concert on 8 October 2011 at Caesars. In 2011, John performed vocals on \"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\" with Kate Bush for her album \"50 Words for Snow\". On 3 February 2012, Elton John visited Costa Rica for the first time when he performed at the recently built National Stadium.\n\nOn 4 June 2012, he performed at the Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace, performing a repertoire including \"Your Song\", \"Crocodile Rock\" and \"I'm Still Standing\". On 30 June, John performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Queen + Adam Lambert for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. An album containing remixes of songs that he recorded in the 1970s called \"Good Morning to the Night\" was released in July 2012. The remixes were conducted by Australian group Pnau and the album reached number one in the U.K. At the 2012 Pride of Britain Awards on 30 October, Elton John, along with Michael Caine, Richard Branson, Simon Cowell and Stephen Fry, recited Rudyard Kipling's poem \"If—\" in tribute to the 2012 British Olympic and Paralympics athletes.\n\nIn February 2013, John performed a duet with singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Later in 2013 he collaborated with rock band Queens of the Stone Age on their sixth studio album \"...Like Clockwork\", contributing piano and vocals on the song \"Fairweather Friends\". He stated that he was a fan of frontman Josh Homme's side project, Them Crooked Vultures, and had contacted Homme via phone call, asking if he could perform on the album. In September 2013, John received the first Brits Icon Award for his \"lasting impact\" on the culture of the United Kingdom. Rod Stewart presented him the award on stage at the London Palladium before the two performed a duet of \"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\". John's thirty-first album, \"The Diving Board\", produced by T-Bone Burnett, was released in September 2013 and reached number three in the U.K. and number four in the U.S. In October 2015, it was announced he would release his 32nd studio album, \"Wonderful Crazy Night\", on 5 February 2016. As with his previous album, it was produced by T-Bone Burnett. The album's first single, \"Looking Up\", was released in the same month. This album marked John's first full album recorded with his touring band since 2006's \"The Captain & the Kid\". He also had a major role, playing himself, in the action sequel \"\", which was released in September 2017.\nOn 26 January 2017, it was announced that John would be composing the score for the Broadway musical version of the novel \"The Devil Wears Prada\" and its film adaptation along with Kevin McCollum as the producer and Paul Rudnick writing the lyrics and story. The timeline for the musical is yet to be announced. In June 2017, John appeared in the award-wining documentary \"The American Epic Sessions\", directed by Bernard MacMahon. In the film, John recorded live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. John composed and arranged a lyric, “Two Fingers of Whiskey”, written by Bernie Taupin, specially for the film, live on camera with the help of Jack White and T Bone Burnett. Danny Eccleston in \"Mojo\" pointed out that “in one of the series’ most extraordinary moments, Elton John arrives toting a box-fresh lyric by Bernie Taupin and works it up in an instant, the song materializing in front of the viewers eyes before John and Jack White go for the take. There's the magic right there.” “Two Fingers of Whiskey” was released on 9 June 2017 on \"\".\n\nOn 24 January 2018, it was announced that John would be retiring from touring and would soon embark on a three-year farewell tour. The first concert took place in Allentown, Pennsylvania on 8 September 2018. John cited spending time with his children as the reason for his retirement saying, \"Ten years ago if you asked me if I would stop touring I would have said no. But we had children and that changed our lives. I have had an amazing life and career but my life has changed. My priorities are now my children and my husband and my family.\"\n\nA biopic about John's life in the 1970s and 1980s, titled \"Rocketman\", is under process by Paramount Pictures, and set to be released in May 2019. It is to be directed by Dexter Fletcher, who directed \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", a biopic about John's close friend Freddie Mercury, and will star Taron Egerton as John. In September 2018, John reportedly signed an agreement with Universal Music Group (UMG) to represent his new music \"for the rest of his career\" in addition to his work from the last 50 years.\n\nElton John has written with his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin since 1967, when he answered an advertisement for talent placed in the popular U.K. music publication, \"New Musical Express\", by Liberty records A&R man Ray Williams. The pair have collaborated on more than thirty albums to date. The writing style that Elton John and Bernie Taupin use involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own, and John then putting them to music, with the two never in the same room during the process. Taupin would write a set of lyrics, then post them to John, wherever he was in the world, who would then lay down the music, arrange it, and record. Speaking about their 50-year partnership in November 2017, John stated, \"we've never ever had an argument professionally or personally which is extraordinary because most songwriters sometimes split up because they get jealous of each other and it's exciting because it's never changed from the first day we wrote songs. I still write the song when he's not there and then I go and play it to him. So the excitement is still the same as it was from day one and that's kept it fresh and it's kept it exciting.\"\n\nIn 1992, John was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. He is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA). His voice was once classed as a tenor; it is now a baritone. His piano playing is influenced by classical music and gospel music. He used Paul Buckmaster to arrange the music on his studio albums during the 1970s.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Elton John was engaged to be married to his first lover, secretary Linda Woodrow, who is mentioned in the song \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\". He married German recording engineer Renate Blauel on 14 February 1984, in Darling Point, Sydney, with speculation that the marriage was a cover for his homosexuality. John came out as bisexual in a 1976 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", but after his divorce from Blauel in 1988, he told the magazine he was \"comfortable\" being gay.\n\nIn 1993, he began a relationship with David Furnish, a former advertising executive and now filmmaker originally from Toronto, Canada. On 21 December 2005 (the day the Civil Partnership Act came into force), John and Furnish were amongst the first couples to form a civil partnership in the United Kingdom, which was held at the Windsor Guildhall. After gay marriage became legal in England in March 2014, John and Furnish married in Windsor, Berkshire, on 21 December 2014, the ninth anniversary of their civil partnership. They have two sons. Their oldest, Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John, was born to a surrogate mother on 25 December 2010 in California. Their younger, son, Elijah Joseph Daniel Furnish-John, was born on 11 January 2013 to the same surrogate mother. John also has ten godchildren, including Sean Lennon, David and Victoria Beckham's sons Brooklyn and Romeo, Elizabeth Hurley's son Damian Hurley, and the daughter of Seymour Stein.\n\nIn 2010, John was criticised by some Christian groups in the U.S. after describing Jesus as a \"compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems\". Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and opponent of gay marriage, responded: \"To call Jesus a homosexual is to label him a sexual deviant. But what else would we expect from a man who previously said, 'From my point of view, I would ban religion completely.'\"\n\nIn 2008, John stated he preferred civil partnerships over marriage for gay people. However, by 2012, John had changed his position and become a staunch supporter of same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom. He was quoted as saying: \"There is a world of difference between calling someone your 'partner' and calling them your 'husband'. 'Partner' is a word that should be preserved for people you play tennis with, or work alongside in business. It doesn't come close to describing the love that I have for David, and he for me. In contrast, 'husband' does.\" In 2014, he claimed Jesus would have been in favour of same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2013, Elton John resisted calls to boycott Russia in protest at the Russian gay propaganda law, but told fans at a Moscow concert that the Russian laws were \"inhumane and isolating\" and he was \"deeply saddened and shocked over the current legislation\". In a January 2014 interview, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke of John in an attempt to show that there was no gay discrimination in Russia, stating; \"Elton John – he's an extraordinary person, a distinguished musician, and millions of our people sincerely love him, regardless of his sexual orientation.\" John responded by offering to introduce the president to Russians abused under Russian legislation banning \"homosexual propaganda\". On 24 September 2015, the Associated Press reported that President Putin called John and invited him to meet in the future to discuss LGBT rights in Russia. Putin's call came just a few days after two phone pranksters called Elton John, pretending to be Putin and his spokesman, and causing John to erroneously thank Putin for the call on the singer's Instagram account.\n\nIn April 2009, the \"Sunday Times Rich List\" estimated John's wealth to be £175million (), and ranked him as the 322nd wealthiest person in Britain. John was estimated to have a fortune of £195million in the \"Sunday Times Rich List\" of 2011, making him one of the 10 wealthiest people in the British music industry. Aside from his main home Woodside in Old Windsor, Berkshire, John owns residences in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nice, Holland Park in London, and Venice. John's property in Nice is based on Mon Boron mountain. Elton John is an art collector, and is believed to have one of the largest private photography collections in the world.\n\nIn 2000, he admitted to spending £30million in just under two years—an average of £1.5million a month. Between January 1996 and September 1997, he spent more than £9.6m on property and £293,000 on flowers. In June 2001 John sold 20 of his cars at Christie's, saying he didn't get the chance to drive them because he was out of the country so often. The sale, which included a 1993 Jaguar XJ220, the most expensive at £234,750, and several Ferraris, Rolls-Royces, and Bentleys, raised nearly £2million. In 2003, John sold the contents of his Holland Park home—expected to fetch £800,000 at Sotheby's—to modernise the decoration and to display some of his contemporary art collection. Every year since 2004, John has opened a shop called \"Elton's Closet\" in which he sells his second-hand clothes.\n\nBy 1975, the pressures of stardom had begun to take a serious toll on him. During \"Elton Week\" in Los Angeles that year, he had a cocaine overdose. He also developed the eating disorder bulimia. In a CNN interview with Larry King in 2002, King asked if John knew of Diana, Princess of Wales' eating disorder. John replied, \"Yes, I did. We were both bulimic.\"\n\nA longtime tennis enthusiast, he wrote the song \"Philadelphia Freedom\" in tribute to friend Billie Jean King's World Team Tennis team, the Philadelphia Freedoms. King was a player-coach for the team at the time. John and King remain friends and co-host an annual pro-am event to benefit AIDS charities, most notably Elton John's own Elton John AIDS Foundation, for which King is a chairwoman. John, who maintains a part-time residence in Atlanta, Georgia, became a fan of the Atlanta Braves baseball team when he moved there in 1991. In 2015, he was named one of \"GQ\"'s 50 best dressed British men.\n\nOn 22 April 2017, he was discharged from hospital after two nights of intensive care for contracting \"a harmful and unusual\" bacterial infection during his return flight home from a South American tour in Santiago, Chile and was forced to cancel all of his shows scheduled for April and May 2017.\n\nHaving supported Watford since growing up locally, Elton John became the club's chairman and director in 1976, appointing Graham Taylor as manager and investing large sums of money as the club rose three divisions into the English First Division. The pinnacle of the club's success was finishing runners up in the First Division to Liverpool in 1983 and reaching the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium in 1984. He sold the club to Jack Petchey in 1987, but remained president.\n\nIn 1997, he re-purchased the club from Petchey and once again became chairman. He stepped down in 2002 when the club needed a full-time chairman although he continued as president of the club. Although no longer the majority shareholder, he still holds a significant financial interest. In June 2005 he held a concert at Watford's home stadium, Vicarage Road, donating the funds to the club, and another concert in May 2010. He has remained friends with a number of high-profile players in football, including Pelé and David Beckham. For a time, from late 1975 until 1976, he was a part-owner of the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League. On 13 December 2014, he appeared at Watford's Vicarage Road with David Furnish and John's sons Zachary and Elijah for the opening of the \"Sir Elton John stand\". He described the occasion as \"one of the greatest days of my life\".\n\nJohn announced his intention to vote Remain during the 2016 EU referendum on Instagram, sharing an image with the words “build bridges not walls” along with the caption: “I'm voting to remain. #StrongerInEurope”. \n\nJohn has said that he took risks with unprotected sex during the 1980s and considers himself lucky to have avoided catching AIDS during the AIDS epidemic. In 1986, he joined with Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder to record the single \"That's What Friends Are For\", with all profits being donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. The song won John and the others the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In April 1990, John performed his 1968 ballad \"Skyline Pigeon\" at the funeral of Ryan White, a teenage haemophiliac he had befriended.\n\nElton John became more closely associated with AIDS charities following the deaths of his friends Ryan White in 1990 and Freddie Mercury in 1991, raising large amounts of money and using his public profile to raise awareness of the disease. He founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992 as a charity to fund programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention, for the elimination of prejudice and discrimination against HIV/AIDS-affected individuals, and for providing services to people living with or at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. This cause continues to be one of his personal passions. In 1993, he began hosting his annual Academy Award Party, which has become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry, and has raised over .\n\nTo raise money for his AIDS charity, he annually hosts a White Tie & Tiara Ball in the grounds of his home in Old Windsor in Berkshire to which many famous celebrities are invited. On 28 June 2007, the 9th annual White Tie & Tiara Ball took place. The menu consisted of a truffle soufflé followed by surf and turf and a giant Knickerbocker glory ice cream. An auction followed the dinner held by Stephen Fry. A Rolls Royce 'Phantom' drophead coupe and a piece of Tracey Emin's artwork both raised £800,000 for the charity fund, with the total amount raised reaching £3.5million. Later, John sang \"Delilah\" with Tom Jones and \"Big Spender\" with Shirley Bassey. The 2011 guests included Sarah, Duchess of York, Elizabeth Hurley and George Michael (who performed \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" in a duet with John), and the auction raised £5million, adding to the £45million the Balls have raised for the Elton John Aids Foundation.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1994. He and Bernie Taupin had previously been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992. John was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1995. For his charitable work, John was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 February 1998. In October 1975, John became the 1,662nd person to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHe was awarded Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. He became a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor in 2004, and a Disney Legends Award in 2006. In 2000, he was named the MusiCares Person of the Year for his artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy. In 2010, he was awarded with the PRS for Music Heritage Award, which was erected on The Namaste Lounge Pub in Northwood, London, where John performed his first ever gig.\n\nMusic awards include the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" from \"The Lion King\", the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1994 for \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" from \"The Lion King\", and the Tony Award for Best Original Score in 2000 for \"Aida\", all of which he shared with Tim Rice. He has also received five Brit Awards, including the award for Best British Male in 1991, and awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1986 and 1995. In 2013, John received the first Brits Icon award in recognition of his \"lasting impact\" on UK culture, which was presented to him by his close friend Rod Stewart.\n\nAcademy Awards\nBrit Awards\n\nGrammy Awards\nIvor Novello Awards\n\nJuno Awards\n\nMTV Video Music Awards\nMVPA Awards\nNRJ Music Awards\n\nTony Awards\nSince 1970, John's band, of which he is the pianist and lead singer, has been known as the Elton John Band.

{"id": "206190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206190", "title": "Eric Dorman-Smith", "text": "Eric Dorman-Smith\n\nBrigadier Eric Edward (\"Chink\") Dorman-Smith (24 July 1895 – 11 May 1969), who later changed his name to Eric Edward Dorman O'Gowan, was an Irish officer whose career in the British Army began in the First World War and closed at the end of the Second World War. In the 1950s, Dorman-Smith became an officer in the Irish Republican Army (IRA). In the 1920s, during the interwar period, he was one of the military thinkers in various countries, like Heinz Guderian in Germany and Charles de Gaulle in France, who realised that technology and motorisation were changing the way that wars and battles were fought. Influenced by J. F. C. Fuller, Archibald Wavell, B. H. Liddell Hart, and many others, Dorman-Smith tried to change the culture of the British Army and held a number of teaching and training roles in various parts of the British Empire. Although he made several contributions in advisory roles during the campaigns in the Western Desert from 1940 to 1941, it was not until May 1942 that he went on active service again. His service in the Second World War is shrouded in controversy and ended when he was fired from his command in August 1944.\n\nDorman-Smith was born to a mixed-religion couple in Bellamont Forest, Cootehill, County Cavan, Ireland. He was received into the Catholic Church four days after his birth as a result of his Catholic mother's pleading. His younger brothers, Victor and Reggie, were baptised Protestant (though all three boys are listed as Catholic in the 1901 Census). His best friend as a child in Cootehill was John Charles McQuaid, the local doctor's son, who was later appointed Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.\n\nAt the age of 12, he was sent to St Anthony's, a Catholic school in Eastbourne, Sussex. His Cavan accent and buck teeth made him stand out and, in the effort to modify his accent, he developed a stutter. While there, his parents moved to Maidenhead, Berkshire in England and, after a year, he was moved to Lambrook, which was a school attended by his younger brothers, whereupon his stutter vanished. In 1910, he went to Uppingham School, Rutland, where he befriended Brian Horrocks, a future general. During his school days he showed that he had strong principles, in particular there were episodes of casual anti-semitism towards friends of his which he reportedly took steps to address.\n\nDorman-Smith's father insisted he take the entrance exam for the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in December 1912 and he scored 6969/12600, being placed 69th in the order of merit, thus obtaining one of the 172 available places. Horrocks also succeeded, ranked 171. After two terms, he passed out in exemplary fashion, leaving Horrocks to complete a third term, achieving 515/600 in military history and 2031/2800 in general military subjects. His overall score was 7976/10,500, placing him 10th. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 1st Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers (later the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) on 25 February 1914, just six months before the outbreak of the First World War. Dorman-Smith gained his nickname \"Chink\" on his first night in the officers' mess when his fellow subaltern, Richard Vachell, noted his resemblance to the Chinkara antelope mascot that the regiment had had to leave behind when they moved back to England from India.\n\n\"Chink\", along with the rest of his battalion, then serving as part of the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Division, were sent to France on 13 August 1914, nine days after Britain entered the First World War, and were some of the first troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to arrive. The battalion, and Dorman-Smith himself, were involved in the Battle of Mons, where he was wounded in the retreat. Later that year he was involved in the battles of Messines, Armentières and Ypres and, after being promoted on 15 November to the temporary rank of lieutenant, received another wound on 9 December. He was promoted to substantive lieutenant on 2 January 1915.\n\nIn May 1915 the battalion was involved in fighting at Railway Wood, near Ypres, during the Second Battle of Ypres. Although he had received a shrapnel wound and four lesser injuries from rifle bullets, he organised, under heavy fire, a withdrawal of the survivors of his battalion, for which he was awarded one of the first batch of the Military Cross (MC). Promoted to temporary captain on 26 June 1915, he was mentioned in dispatches on 1 January 1916 and his rank of captain was made permanent on 26 August 1916. After a difficult period of convalescence, he was sent to teach trench warfare to new recruits and in January 1917 he was posted to the Northern School of Instruction. He returned to active service in July 1917 and he was temporarily promoted to the acting rank of major on 16 October and was made second-in-command (2IC) of the 10th (Service) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers, a Kitchener's Army battalion, then serving on the Western Front as part of the 68th Brigade of the 23rd Division.\n\nIn November 1917, Dorman-Smith was posted as a captain to the Italian Piave Front on attachment to the 68th Brigade School, and from 4 April until 6 July 1918 he served as adjutant to the 12th (Service) Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, another Kitchener's Army unit, serving in the same 68th Brigade of the 23rd Division. He was mentioned in dispatches a second time on 30 May 1918 and was again promoted to the temporary rank of major on 7 July 1918. He served as 2IC to the battalion and finished the war in Genoa, recovering from an attack of gastroenteritis, with a bar added to his MC. Upon his discharge from hospital he was appointed Commandant of the British Troops and sent to Milan. In Milan on 3 November 1918, he met Ernest Hemingway, who had been wounded at the Italian front and decorated with the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery while serving with the Red Cross. He was posted to the Military Landing Staff at Taranto before returning to England as adjutant to the Northumberland Fusiliers. He was mentioned in dispatches a third time on 9 January 1919.\n\nIn June 1921, the regiment was posted to his native Ireland as part of the effort to repress the rebellion. His battalion was part of the Curragh 5th Division and from its headquarters in Carlow, its role was to patrol the county of Kilkenny. He discovered that his childhood nurse had married the local IRA brigadier and on one occasion, helped her bury a cache of hand grenades on the grounds of Bellamont Forest prior to a raid by the Black and Tans but otherwise remained politically neutral.\n\nHis period of duty in Ireland ended in February 1922 and he moved to the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), still as adjutant of his regiment. He witnessed the breakdown of transport and communications after the French sent troops into the Ruhr basin in January 1923 to enforce war reparations.\n\nIn 1924, he left his regiment to become an instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he became acquainted with Richard O'Connor; the duo went on a walking tour of the Austro-Italian Alps at the end of 1924. In 1927, Dorman-Smith sat the entrance examination for the Staff College, Camberley. In the Strategy paper the examiner, J. F. C. Fuller, awarded him 1,000 marks out of a possible 1,000. The advantage of gaining the p.s.c. (passed Staff College) was that the two-year course provided a network of 180 highly trained officers for help afterwards. By arriving with such a splash, it is probable that Dorman-Smith became regarded with suspicion by people who would one day be his peers and superior officers. Many of Dorman-Smith's fellow students there included the future general officers of the Second World War, including Philip Christison, Evelyn Barker, Oliver Leese, Eric Hayes, John Hawkesworth, Ronald Penney, John Whiteley, Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman, Eric Nares, Charles Norman, Stanley Kirby, Wilfrid Lloyd, Reginald Savory and Clement West.\n\nOn 28 December 1928 he passed out Grade A in the top four and publicly burned his lecture notes, including those from Bernard Montgomery, one of the instructors. They had already clashed on numerous occasions and \"Chink\" had also failed to attend his class on \"The Registering of Personality\", which he regarded as unnecessary for the formulation of successful tactics. He then became the first infantryman to hold the post of instructor of tactics at Chatham, the Royal Engineers' equivalent of the Staff College. In 1929 he was commissioned to write a textbook on military tactics, which became an official army handbook, \"Infantry Section Leaders' Training\", within two years.\n\nPromoted to the brevet rank of major on 1 January 1931, in July he was appointed brigade major to the 6th Experimental Brigade at Blackdown, under Archibald Wavell, who, along with Richard O'Connor and Claude Auchinleck, were the most significant influences on his career and his most prominent supporters. Wavell aimed to increase the mobility of the army and led exercises to this aim, in which Dorman-Smith assisted. He encouraged Dorman-Smith to ignore the standard manuals and devise new tactical approaches. Promoted to substantive major on 23 November 1933, in 1934, on the recommendation of O'Connor, he was appointed to the War Office at the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel, which he was promoted to on 1 July 1934. He allied himself with Liddell Hart in a crusade against the use of horses in the army. He devised an estimate of British casualties over the first year of a big war into three categories; 25 percent caused by enemy action, 25 percent by indifferent generalship and accidents of war, 50 percent by the Treasury.\n\nIt was at that time Dorman-Smith began to clash with Alan Brooke, whom he viewed as the epitome of a traditional Royal Horse Artillery officer, with little interest in the requirements of modern mechanised warfare. On a return to the Staff College, Camberley in 1936, he had to deliver lectures on tactics which he considered already outdated. He spent his leisure time devising with Philip Christison, one of his fellow students at the Staff College almost a decade before and then a fellow instructor, more up-to-date theories of supply, staff duties and tactical handling, only to be reprimanded by Major-General Lord Gort, the Commandant of the Staff College.\n\nAfter sixteen months, rather than the customary three years, Dorman-Smith was promoted to substantive lieutenant colonel on 26 April 1937 and was appointed Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion of his regiment, now retitled the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, then serving in Egypt. His farewell speech to the Staff College on the success of Benito Mussolini's Abyssinian campaign was not well received, probably because of its emphasis on the more mechanised approach of the Italian Army compared with the British Army. In Egypt, Dorman-Smith clashed with his new command about his disregard for polo training and he was far from impressed by their military ability. He tried, without success, to break down barriers between British and Egyptian companies, probably another campaign that would be held against this unconventional officer.\n\nLate in 1937, he went to Mersa Matruh to re-design the fortifications. His assessment of the terrain was to colour his estimate of Neil Ritchie's generalship when facing Erwin Rommel's assault in mid-1942, and he seems to have realised that El Alamein was going to be the decisive battleground in Egypt. In March 1938, he was offered the post of Director of Military Training for India, a major-general's appointment, and he left Egypt in May. He was promoted to brevet colonel and to the temporary rank of brigadier on 10 May and his permanent rank was advanced to colonel on 1 July (with seniority backdated to 10 May 1937). The later Regimental History thanks Dorman-Smith for his modernising efforts in helping the battalion to survive the desert campaign, although it appears that they were glad to see the back of him.\n\nIn India, he soon got to know the Commander-in-Chief's loyal aide, \"Bunny\" Careless, who developed an antipathy that might have re-surfaced when Dorman-Smith was his brigade commander in Italy in 1944. The occupant of the office next door to Dorman-Smith was the Deputy Chief, General Staff, Claude Auchinleck. They became close companions and went on hill-walks before breakfast each day. They developed a plan to transform the Indian Army but the outbreak of the Second World War put paid to them. In January 1940, Auchinleck was appointed to command IV Corps in England. In August of that year, Wavell asked Dorman-Smith to take over command of the Staff College, Haifa in Palestine, taking over the position from Brigadier Alexander Galloway.\n\nIn October 1940, over a year after the outbreak of the Second World War, Wavell, the C-in-C of Middle East Command, asked Dorman-Smith to look into the feasibility of taking the offensive against the Italian forces who had invaded Egypt from Libya. On delivery of his report, he was sent as an adviser to Major-General Richard O'Connor and the Western Desert Force (WDF).\n\nDorman-Smith is credited by historian Correlli Barnett with planning Operation Compass and with the discovery of a gap in the Italian lines south of Sidi Barrani. He was then sent back to Haifa while the WDF carried out his daring plan with great success. In January 1941, Wavell again asked him to report to O'Connor and assess the progress of the campaign in order to distil what could be learned from its success. He stayed with the army until, in early February, the Italian 10th Army surrendered near Benghazi. O'Connor sent him back to Cairo to ask Wavell's permission to advance on Tripoli but in the meantime Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had instructed Wavell to send troops to the aid of Greece, ending Operation Compass. \"Chink\" returned to Haifa on 13 February 1941.\n\nIn April 1941, he was temporarily appointed Brigadier General Staff (BGS) and watched from a distance while Erwin Rommel won back all the territory that O'Connor had gained and the Allied forces were pushed out of the Balkans and Greece. He conveyed several messages to Major-General Bernard Freyberg who was preparing the defence of Crete. His temporary appointment ended at the end of May and he again returned to the Staff College, Haifa. When the news arrived that Wavell was going to be replaced by Auchinleck as C-in-C in the Middle East in July, Dorman-Smith probably thought that he stood a chance of getting a permanent role closer to the action but no job offer was made. By December, he had made up his mind to retire from the army. He had a meeting with Auchinleck and was appointed Liaison Officer for Persia and Iraq. Although he realised that was a meaningless sinecure, he stayed on. In February 1942, Auchinleck sent him to assess the condition of the Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie. His conclusion, shared by everyone he consulted, was that Ritchie, although an excellent staff officer, should be replaced but Auchinleck took no action. After a few more unproductive months in which he again offered his resignation (which Auchinleck tore up) he worked on a proposal for a Higher Command School with Field Marshal Jan Smuts. He was offered on 8 May a choice of major-general positions, an unspecified role under Wavell in India or Deputy Chief of the General Staff in Cairo. \"Chink\" accepted the latter and was promoted to acting major-general on 16 June.\n\nUntil 6 August 1942, when he was sacked, Dorman-Smith, a full colonel but holding the acting rank of major-general, served as chief of staff to Auchinleck, the C-in-C Middle East. Auchinleck took over command of the Eighth Army on 25 June after the failure of Ritchie to provide effective resistance to the Axis forces and took Dorman-Smith along to act as his staff officer. Dorman-Smith's novel use of intelligence derived from Ultra decrypts, led them to formulate tactics based on systematic attacks on the weak points of the German forces, notably the Italian formations, which proved successful in slowing down and finally disrupting the German advance. The stream of bad news from this war zone in the weeks prior to Auchinleck's assumption of personal command, had led to a crisis of confidence in Whitehall. Churchill and Alan Brooke, now the Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, visited Cairo in August 1942 to take stock of the situation. They were not impressed by Auchinleck's poor grasp of public relations work and decided that a change of command was required.\n\nThe key moment of the entire desert war saw Dorman-Smith and Auchinleck finally stop Rommel in a few days of desperate fighting in the First_Battle_of_El_Alamein in and around Ruweisat Ridge in early July, where their direct and centralized control of the ragged 8th Army defeated the panzers. General Montgomery used the Auchinleck and Dorman-Smiths concepts to conduct and win the defensive battle at the Battle_of_Alam_el_Halfa a few weeks later. \n\nBrooke had spoken to his former protégé Ritchie and various other senior officers whom he knew from his days with the horse artillery and came to the conclusion that Dorman-Smith was a poor advisor to Auchinleck,\n\nMajor St J. Oswald, a G2 Staff Officer at Eighth Army HQ who eventually rose to the rank of major-general, said of Dorman-Smith, \"He really was as near being a lunatic as you can get\". For his services in the Middle East Dorman-Smith was twice mentioned in dispatches, on 30 December 1941, and on 24 June 1943.\n\nDorman-Smith never held any important military positions after this date. He reverted to the rank of brigadier on 11 September 1942 and was soon appointed to command the 160th Infantry Brigade. part of the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, a first line Territorial Army (TA) formation, commanded by Major-General Robert Ross. The 53rd Division was serving in Kent, preparing and training for the invasion of Normandy, as part of XII Corps, then commanded by Lieutenant-General James Gammell, who was replaced in mid-November by Lieutenant-General Montagu Stopford. Another unfortunate meeting took place on 20 November, when Churchill paid a visit to the 53rd Division and invited \"Chink\" to the official lunch party. The latter found himself in an argument with the Prime Minister and gave him a patronising lecture on military tactics. Six months later, in May 1943, Exercise Spartan took place and although his brigade performed well, however, there was no official recognition. To compound his misfortune, on 11 November 1943, Dorman-Smith learned that the new XII Corps commander, in succession to Stopford who was being posted to India, was going to be Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, who he had been so critical of in North Africa. Believing that it would be too embarrassing to serve directly under Ritchie, Dorman-Smith wrote to Major-General Ross, with the request that he be moved to a new post. As a result, on 21 November he was ordered to vacate his command and stay on leave of absence until further notice, although Ross made it clear to Dorman-Smith that this was in no way a reflection on his efficiency.\n\nRemaining virtually unemployed for the next few months, in late April 1944 Dorman-Smith learned that he was to be given command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, part of the 1st Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Ronald Penney, then fighting on the Italian Front in the Anzio beachhead. By now, however, his reputation was such that all the senior British commanders in Italy, from General Sir Harold Alexander, C-in-C of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), who had succeeded General Auchinleck as C-in-C Middle East in August 1942, along with his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General John Harding, and Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, the Eighth Army commander, all wished to turn him down, but were overruled by Brooke, who made it clear to Dorman-Smith that this was his \"sink or swim\" moment. Alexander, Harding and Leese had all been fellow students at Camberley in the late 1920s, Alexander in the year senior, Harding − \"independent of mind and short of stature\" − and one who Dorman-Smith greatly respected, in the year below, whereas Leese had been in Dorman-Smith's year.\n\nHowever, Penney, his new divisional commander, who had been a fellow student at the Staff College, Camberley in the late 1920s, was not at all happy with his new brigade commander, greeting him with the words \"I didn't want you before and I don't want you now\". There was some history behind this. At the Staff College the two men had clashed, Dorman-Smith frequently deriding him while Penney then believed that \"Chink\" would be a staff officer and one who should not command troops in battle, and refused to change his opinion. Furthermore, Dorman-Smith's predecessor, Brigadier J. G. James, had been hugely popular in his brigade, causing some resentment among the battalion commanders.\n\nWhen Dorman-Smith arrived in the Anzio beachhead, the fighting was reminiscent of the fighting on the Western Front almost 30 years before, with static warfare replacing the mobility that had existed in the Western Desert. Soon after his arrival, Major General Lucian Truscott, commanding the U.S. VI Corps (under which the 1st Division had been serving since January), received orders from his superior, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commanding the American Fifth Army, to break out of the Anzio beachhead. This was to coincide with the Allied forces further south in their successful attempt in breaching the Gustav Line. Dorman-Smith's brigade spearheaded the 1st Division's advance up the western flank of Italy, along the way becoming engaged in numerous small-scale fights while trying to reach the River Tiber. During most of this period Penney was away, having been badly injured in February by a shell in some of the fiercest fighting at Anzio. He was replaced on a temporary basis by Major-General John Hawkesworth, yet another of Dorman-Smith's fellow students at Camberley, and a close friend, but he returned to his 46th Division in Palestine in late May, and was replaced by Brigadier Charles Loewen, the Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA) of X Corps who, unlike Hawkesworth, was a total stranger to \"Chink\", but one who he respected. Penney returned to the division, now advancing forwards to the Gothic Line defences, in mid-June, but his injuries rendered him unfit to continue in command and relinquished control of the division to Loewen, now a major general, in late July. Soon afterwards, however, Dorman-Smith himself was relieved of command of the 3rd Brigade.\n\nDespite his brigade having performed well thus far, he was sacked again after it was alleged that his battalion commanders had complained about his leadership. Penney, reporting to Leese, the Eighth Army commander, declared him \"unfit for brigade command\". The circumstances behind his demotion are controversial. He was in command of three battalions. James Hackett wrote in 1984 that Dorman-Smith was summoned by the divisional commander to give his opinion of his superior officer, a procedure that annoyed and offended him. Neither of the other two officers left accounts of the episode, however. The only evidence rests on the report of the divisional commander, which is tainted by inaccuracies in that at least one of the three officers did not lay a complaint. Greacen's biography includes a summary of the differences between the three accounts of this episode made by Penney on various occasions. Nevertheless, he was relieved on 13 August and returned to the United Kingdom, retiring from the army, after almost 30 years' service, on 14 December, and was granted the honorary rank of brigadier.\n\nRichard Mead states that \"Even for a British Army which had advanced beyond recognition between 1939 and 1944, Dorman-Smith was too clever and he compounded this sin by being intolerant of those with lesser intellects and, moreover, of letting it show. It was his misfortune to be associated with failure in the Western Desert, but his antagonism of the military establishment meant that he would probably never have advanced to the heights to which his intellectual gifts would otherwise have qualified him.\"\n\nFour years after he was forcibly retired from the British Army, he changed his name from Dorman-Smith to O'Gowan, having long been aware that his father was descended from the O'Gowans, who had once been a ruling family in Ulster. In 1945 he had contested the safe Tory seat of Wirral, Cheshire for the Liberal Party. He won 14,302 votes and retained his deposit, coming third, with Selwyn Lloyd easily retaining the seat for the Conservatives with 51% of the votes of those who cast ballots. \"Chink\" retired to Dublin. Eve joined him in November 1945, gave birth to Christopher on 10 May 1946 and to Rionagh in December 1947. He began to study in the library at University College, Dublin, after his application to read for a degree was rejected.\n\nThroughout his military career, Dorman-Smith had retained contacts with Ireland. He did not inherit Bellamont Forest until his father died in March 1948 and his parents had long ceased to reside there, leading to the estate becoming run-down by the time he took it over but he had paid regular visits during the 20s and 30s. The estate was from the Ulster border and at times it became a place of interest to the Republicans. During one of Dorman-Smith's stays, Éamon de Valera who seems to have been interested in learning of \"Chink's\" views on the state of the Irish army, made an informal and unannounced visit. During his time at the Staff College, Camberley in 1927 to 1928, two Irish Army officers paid an official visit - after rebukes from the United Kingdom for visiting Fort Leavenworth in the United States and Bernard Montgomery, the senior lecturer, ordered a boycott so the welcoming party consisted only of the Commandant and Dorman-Smith.\n\nIn 1950, he joined Clann na Poblachta, a new party led by Seán MacBride, who had been an Irish Republican Army officer in Carlow during Dorman-O'Gowan's posting there. His ties and allegiance to the UK were fading fast. In May 1951 he stood for election to the Dáil as an independent candidate in Cavan, since Clann were already supporting another candidate. He polled just 495 votes - the lowest of the eight candidates. He later became an IRA advisor to the IRA Executive during the 1950s Border Campaign.\n\nHis first contact with the IRA seems to have been in the aftermath of their raid on the Gough Barracks in Armagh on 12 June 1954. Chief of Staff Tony Magan and the Adjutant-General Charlie Murphy visited him for discussions at Bellamont Forest. In July 1954, he spoke at a reunification rally in Manchester, making it clear that he was distancing himself from the policies of the UK. He grew frustrated at not being made part of the decision-making process of the IRA and when a raid on Omagh went wrong, he began to realise that the IRA did not meet his ideals of efficiency.\n\nDuring 1955–56, his estate was used as a training-ground by the IRA two weekends a year but he was excluded from playing a role despite his eagerness to assist. He does not appear to have kept these contacts secret. Dame Daphne du Maurier, wife of his former Sandhurst adjutant Frederick \"Boy\" Browning, wrote a story about this side of his life, \"A Border-Line Case\".\n\nThe British establishment appears to have dismissed him as a harmless crank. On 15 December 1956, after the failure of Operation Harvest and the introduction of the Special Powers Act, Charlie Murphy and Seán Cronin visited to convey the message that his usefulness to the IRA was over.\n\nDorman-Smith was an unorthodox commander and has attracted contrasting opinions. To some, such as B. H. Liddell Hart, he was \"...the outstanding soldier of his generation\". To others, such as Field Marshals Michael Carver and Alanbrooke, he was a \"sinister influence\" and the major cause of Auchinleck's dismissal. Montgomery called him \"a menace\" but despite his antipathy, the Battle of Alam el Halfa was fought on a plan very close to that conceived by Dorman-Smith for Auchinleck. Montgomery made skilful use of the defensive system which he had been instrumental in planning and laying out. Carver, however, points out that Montgomery did make a decisive alteration to this plan by bringing up troops that were to have been held in reserve in the Nile Delta to form a continuous line of defence. The effect of this was to reduce the need for mobility for which the British Army in terms of organisation, training and communications was not highly skilled − despite the efforts of people such as Dorman-Smith to reform it.\n\nThe key characteristic of Dorman-Smith's career is that he was not politically astute and made a number of enemies in the 1920s and 1930s who worked against him, including Penney, Montgomery and most significantly in view of his fall from grace, Brooke, \"I had been worried for some time by Auchinleck's handling of armoured formations, mainly due to his listening to the advice of \"Chink\" Dorman-Smith.\" Montgomery finally initiated battle at El Alamein at a later date than had previously been envisaged in the Auchinleck-Dorman-Smith plan, which was partly responsible for their dismissals.\n\nHe sued Churchill, forcing him to amend \"The Hinge of Fate\", part of his history of the Second World War, so that an implied slur on the fighting mettle of Auchinleck was removed. Less acrimoniously, Montgomery was forced to tone down his criticisms of his predecessors in the Eighth Army, when he published his memoirs in August 1958. When Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander brought out his memoirs in 1961, \"Chink\" was preparing his case but his legal team advised him to withdraw.\n\nHis next meeting with Hemingway after the latter's departure from Genoa in 1919, was in Paris in 1922, where \"Chink\" was spending his vacation with his parents. Hemingway was living there with his wife Hadley and working as a freelance journalist. He invited Dorman-Smith to accompany them to Montreux. They spent their days fishing and climbing mountains and Hemingway alluded to this holiday in \"Green Hills of Africa\". They decided to show Hadley around Milan and crossed the St Bernard Pass on foot - an adventure commemorated by Hemingway in \"A Moveable Feast\".\n\nThey met up over Christmas 1922, again in Montreux and spent the visit luging and skiing. In early 1923, Hemingway visited Dorman-Smith in Cologne on behalf of the Toronto Star newspaper. During the following summer, he visited them in Paris where Hemingway introduced him to the intelligentsia, including John Dos Passos, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford and Ezra Pound. Hemingway's first book, \"In Our Time\", was dedicated to Dorman-Smith and includes some anecdotes from \"Chink's\" memories of the Mons campaign. In March 1924, he paid another visit to Paris and became godfather to Ernest Hemingway's eldest son John.\n\nThat summer, in company with Dos Passos, Donald Ogden Stewart and Robert McAlmon, they visited the San Fermin festival in Pamplona in July and participated in the bull-running. Proof of the high esteem in which Hemingway held Dorman-Smith is contained in his 1924 poem, \"To Chink Whose Trade is Soldiering\". However, after their next meeting in April 1926, when Dorman-Smith was accompanying an army rugby team to Paris, they gradually drifted apart because of the stresses of Dorman-Smith's military career and the changes in Hemingway's life. They did not meet again until Dorman-Smith was touring the USA in April 1950.\n\nHe did not marry young and conducted a series of affairs until on 29 December 1927, he married Estelle, Lady Berney; their union was childless. During his period in Haifa in 1940, he met Eve Nott, with whom he began an affair. They wed on 17 May 1949 at Westminster Registry Office. He had a son and a daughter, Christopher and Rionagh and seven grandchildren and five great grandchildren. Dorman-Smith's youngest brother, Reginald, was Governor of Burma at the time of the Japanese invasion during the Second World War. His other brother Victor, was a Royal Navy Captain.\n\nDorman-Smith died from stomach cancer on 11 May 1969 at Lisdarne hospital, Cavan, at the age of 73.\n\n"}
{"id": "42029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42029", "title": "George III of the United Kingdom", "text": "George III of the United Kingdom\n\nGeorge III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of the two countries on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death in 1820. He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg (\"Hanover\") in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two predecessors, he was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover.\n\nHis life and with it his reign, which were longer than those of any of his predecessors, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nIn the later part of his life, George III had recurrent, and eventually permanent, mental illness. Although it has since been suggested that he had bipolar disorder or the blood disease porphyria, the cause of his illness remains unknown. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George III's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.\n\nHistorical analysis of George III's life has gone through a \"kaleidoscope of changing views\" that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them. Until it was reassessed in the second half of the 20th century, his reputation in the United States was one of a tyrant; and in Britain he became \"the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism\".\n\nGeorge was born in London at Norfolk House in St James's Square. He was the grandson of King George II, and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. As he was born two months prematurely and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's and Bishop of Oxford.\nOne month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were the King of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle the Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy) and his great-aunt the Queen of Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy).\n\nPrince George grew into a healthy but reserved and shy child. The family moved to Leicester Square, where George and his younger brother Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing, and riding. His religious education was wholly Anglican. At age 10, George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play \"Cato\" and said in the new prologue: \"What, tho' a boy! It may with truth be said, A boy in \"England\" born, in England bred.\" Historian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear \"to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated\".\n\nGeorge's grandfather, King George II, disliked the Prince of Wales, and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury at the age of 44, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited his father's title of Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).\n\nIn the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at St James's Palace, but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, Lord Bute, who would later serve as Prime Minister. George's mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.\n\nIn 1759, George was smitten with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of the Duke of Richmond, but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. \"I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation,\" he wrote, \"and consequently must often act contrary to my passions.\" Nevertheless, attempts by the King to marry George to Princess Sophie Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel were resisted by him and his mother; Sophie married the Margrave of Bayreuth instead.\n\nThe following year, at the age of 22, George succeeded to the throne when his grandfather, George II, died suddenly on 25 October 1760, two weeks before his 77th birthday. The search for a suitable wife intensified. On 8 September 1761 in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, the King married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whom he met on their wedding day. A fortnight later on 22 September both were crowned at Westminster Abbey. George remarkably never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a genuinely happy marriage until his mental illness struck. They had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace) for use as a family retreat. His other residences were Kew and Windsor Castle. St James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively, and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at Weymouth, Dorset, which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.\n\nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.\n\nAlthough his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. George was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat. On his accession, the Crown lands produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the Crown Estate to Parliamentary control in return for a civil list annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government. Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts are disputed by historians who say such claims \"rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition\". Debts amounting to over £3 million over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time. He aided the Royal Academy of Arts with large grants from his private funds, and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity. Of his art collection, the two most notable purchases are Johannes Vermeer's \"Lady at the Virginals\" and a set of Canalettos, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered. The King's Library was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.\n\nIn May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of the Duke of Newcastle was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory Lord Bute. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish prejudices amongst the English. John Wilkes, a member of parliament, published \"The North Briton\", which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons, and found guilty \"in absentia\" of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power.\n\nLater that year, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 placed a limit upon the westward expansion of the American colonies. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida). The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions. The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to \"no taxation without representation\". In 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. Meanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.\n\nLord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt and the King, repealed Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City. Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and the Duke of Grafton took over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. Wilkes was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor. Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.\n\nGeorge was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was not shared by his brothers. George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer, and the following year Cumberland married a young widow, Anne Horton. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession. George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.\n\nLord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was \"one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]\". In 1773, the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. In Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was \"certainly criminal\". With the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. Up to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's \"hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution.\" Though the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers.\n\nThe American War of Independence was the culmination of the civil and political American Revolution resulting from the American Enlightenment. Brought to a head over the lack of American representation in Parliament, which was seen as a denial of their rights as Englishmen and often popularly focused on direct taxes levied by Parliament on the colonies without their consent, the colonists resisted the imposition of direct rule after the Boston Tea Party. Creating self-governing provinces, they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774. Armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. After petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament were ignored, the rebel leaders were declared traitors by the Crown and a year of fighting ensued. The colonies declared their independence in July 1776, listing grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George's other offences, the Declaration charged, \"He has abdicated Government here ... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\" The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down. The British captured the city in 1776, but lost Boston, and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga.\n\nGeorge III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. In the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan, the King was determined \"never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.\" The King wanted to \"keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse\". However, more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe. After Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority. With the setbacks in America, Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to co-operate. He died later in the same year. In early 1778, France (Britain's chief rival) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States and the conflict escalated. The United States and France were soon joined by Spain and the Dutch Republic, while Britain had no major allies of its own. Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government. Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III's insistence. Opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the Gordon riots.\n\nAs late as the Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised the independence of the American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, \"I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.\"\n\nWith the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the Duke of Portland. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox–North Coalition. The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister, with Fox and Lord North, as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively.\n\nThe King disliked Fox intensely, for his politics as well as his character; he thought Fox was unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales. George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be displaced easily. He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the East India Company to Parliamentary commissioners. Although the King actually favoured greater control over the Company, the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox. Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George authorised Lord Temple to inform the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and William Pitt the Younger was appointed Prime Minister, with Temple as his Secretary of State. On 17 December 1783, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a \"high crime\" and Temple was forced to resign. Temple's departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent election gave Pitt a firm mandate.\n\nFor George III, Pitt's appointment was a great victory. It proved that he was able to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.\n\nBy this time George's health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. A study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. The source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. The King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate. It was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100 miles (150 km)—but his condition worsened. In November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse. George would frequently repeat himself, and write sentences with over 400 words at a time, as well as his vocabulary becoming more complex, possible symptoms of bipolar disorder. His doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out \"evil humours\".\n\nIn the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, the Prince of Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt's consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.\n\nAfter George's recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales. His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity. James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot the King in the Drury Lane Theatre on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789, in which the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France declared war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of \"habeas corpus\". The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.\n\nA brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. In 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". George used the opportunity to drop the title \"king of France\", which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. It was suggested that George adopt the title \"Emperor of the British Isles\", but he refused. As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. At about the same time, the King had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.\n\nGeorge did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an \"experiment\". In 1803, the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in Hyde Park, London, on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day. \"The Times\" said, \"The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression.\" A courtier wrote on 13 November that, \"The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning.\" George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd, \"We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion ... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them.\" After Admiral Lord Nelson's famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, the possibility of invasion was extinguished.\nIn 1804, George's recurrent illness returned; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George III refused. Lord Grenville perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry. Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This Third Coalition, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his \"Ministry of All the Talents\" included Fox. The King was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future. They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland as the nominal Prime Minister, with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spencer Perceval. Parliament was dissolved, and the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance.\n\nIn late 1810, at the height of his popularity, already virtually blind with cataracts and in pain from rheumatism, George became dangerously ill. In his view the malady had been triggered by stress over the death of his youngest and favourite daughter, Princess Amelia. The Princess's nurse reported that \"the scenes of distress and crying every day ... were melancholy beyond description.\" He accepted the need for the Regency Act of 1811, and the Prince of Wales acted as Regent for the remainder of George III's life. Despite signs of a recovery in May 1811, by the end of the year George had become permanently insane and lived in seclusion at Windsor Castle until his death.\n\nPrime Minister Spencer Perceval was assassinated in 1812 and was replaced by Lord Liverpool. Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. The subsequent Congress of Vienna led to significant territorial gains for Hanover, which was upgraded from an electorate to a kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf. He was incapable of knowing or understanding that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38 pm on 29 January 1820, six days after the death of his fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him. George III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nGeorge was succeeded by two of his sons, George IV and William IV, who both died without surviving legitimate children, leaving the throne to the only legitimate child of the Duke of Kent, Victoria, the last monarch of the House of Hanover.\n\nGeorge III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors and subsequent kings. Only Queens Victoria and Elizabeth II have since lived and reigned longer.\nGeorge III was dubbed \"Farmer George\" by satirists, at first to mock his interest in mundane matters rather than politics, but later to contrast his homely thrift with his son's grandiosity and to portray him as a man of the people. Under George III, the British Agricultural Revolution reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry. There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent Industrial Revolution. George's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now owned by King's College London but housed in the Science Museum, London, to which it has been on long-term loan since 1927. He had the King's Observatory built in Richmond-upon-Thames for his own observations of the 1769 transit of Venus. When William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, he at first named it \"Georgium Sidus\" (George's Star) after the King, who later funded the construction and maintenance of Herschel's 1785 40-foot telescope, which was the biggest ever built at the time.\n\nGeorge III hoped that \"the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve\", but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. While very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists, though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal. The grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as \"repeated injuries and usurpations\" that he had committed to establish an \"absolute Tyranny\" over the colonies. The Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. Contemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating \"attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power\", while the other \"derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition\".\n\nBuilding on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was \"much maligned\", started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign. Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: \"Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence ... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors ... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth.\" In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality.\n\n\nIn Great Britain, George III used the official style \"George the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and so forth\". In 1801, when Great Britain united with Ireland, he dropped the title of king of France, which had been used for every English monarch since Edward III's claim to the French throne in the medieval period. His style became \"George the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.\"\n\nIn Germany, he was \"Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg, Arch-Treasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire\" (\"Herzog von Braunschweig und Lüneburg, Erzschatzmeister und Kurfürst des Heiligen Römischen Reiches\") until the end of the empire in 1806. He then continued as duke until the Congress of Vienna declared him \"King of Hanover\" in 1814.\n\nBefore his succession, George was granted the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, and along with the dukedom of Edinburgh and the position of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points Argent. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted on the arms of the heir, only on the Sovereign's.\n\nFrom his succession until 1800, George bore the royal arms: Quarterly, I Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); IV tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Saxony), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).\n\nFollowing the Acts of Union 1800, the royal arms were amended, dropping the French quartering. They became: Quarterly, I and IV England; II Scotland; III Ireland; overall an escutcheon of Hanover surmounted by an electoral bonnet. In 1816, after the Electorate of Hanover became a kingdom, the electoral bonnet was changed to a crown.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was an early member of the military wing of the party and received military training in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. He participated in the 1979 revolution which established the People's Revolutionary Government with Maurice Bishop at its head. After the revolution, Austin was in charge of the military forces of Grenada.\n\nIn October 1983, factional political issues within the government led deputy prime minister Bernard Coard to place Maurice Bishop under house arrest and to take control of the government. Austin supported the action. Popular demonstrations afterwards broke out against the detention of Bishop. In the course of one demonstration, Bishop was freed from house arrest. Bishop was eventually executed by army soldiers along with many civilians.\n\nAfter the execution of Bishop, Austin disbanded the existing government and formed a military council with himself as chairman that would rule \"until normality is restored.\" He made a radio announcement in which he claimed Bishop had led a mob to seize Fort Rupert, headquarters of the armed forces, with the intention of eliminating the NJM leadership and the army. As a result, Austin said, \"the Revolutionary Armed Forces were forced to storm the fort, and in the process the following persons were killed: Maurice Bishop, Unison Whiteman, Vincent Noel, Jacqueline Creft, Norris Bain and Fitzroy Bain among others.\" He then announced a four-day total curfew, warning the people, \"No one is to leave their house. Anyone violating this curfew will be shot on sight.\"\n\nThe military government lasted for six days, until the United States invaded Grenada on 25 October 1983. Austin was arrested, along with all of those in the government and army who were alleged to have either participated in the decision to kill Bishop or were in the army chain of command that carried out the orders. He was sentenced to death along with Coard and the other coup leaders in 1986, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison.\n\nIn mitigation pleas made in 2007, while he sought to be released from prison he made no attempt to deny his responsibility for what happened in 1983. In the plea it was said that he \"understand(s) the need to satisfy action for loss and suffering and the trauma of the Grenadian people.\"\n\nAustin was released from prison on 18 December 2008, together with Colville McBarnett and John Ventour.\n"}

His paternal grandfather, Alexander Grant, was a veteran of the battle of Culloden of 1746 who later became a director of the East India Company and was the last man to escape from the Black Hole of Calcutta.\n\nGrant attended medical school, and in 1812 he joined the East India Company. Despite his young age, with the influence of his cousin Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg, he was named the surgeon for the \"General Stuart\". Just before leaving on his maiden voyage, Grant married Margaret Urquhart, the daughter of an East India Company official.\n\nOver the next seven years, Grant made three voyages with the East India Company to India and to China. In a brief visit home, he fathered a son, Stewart Majoribanks, who was born in 1817. His daughter Jamesina was born five years later. On his voyages, Grant, like most of his comrades, did a little trading of his own, resulting in a respectable fortune.\n\nIn 1823, he traveled to northern Mexico, ending up in Texas. He became interested in real estate and purchased an estate in Parras, Coahuila, Mexico in 1825. In Coahuila, he was soon involved in politics, where he became secretary of the Executive Council. In 1832, he was a member of the legislature of Coahuila and Texas.\n\nIn 1832 and 1833, he tried his hand in colonizing a settlement near Goliad. In 1833, Grant moved to Nacogdoches, Texas. From March through April, 1835, Grant was secretary of the legislature of Coahuila and Texas at Monclova, Mexico.\nIn Coahuila, he acquired vast landholdings and was friends to the Federalist Mexicans and enemies to the Centralists. In 1834 and 1835 he was \"Jefe de Armas\" or Commander of the local military police. In the spring of 1836, Grant and the Mexican legislators were forced to flee Coahuila when President Santa Anna sent General Martín Perfecto de Cos with a regiment of the Mexican army to disperse the congress.\n\nHe was soon a member of the Texian Army, serving from December 1835 through March 1836, during the Texas Revolution and fighting in the Siege of Bexar. In San Antonio, he would help plan the assault on Bexar and negotiate the surrender of Cos. He served as a Goliad delegate to the Consultation.\n\nIn early December, Grant was advocating for an expedition to invade Matamoros, suggesting Houston was not the person to be in charge of the Texian Army. By January 10, 1836, Grant and Frank W. Johnson, who were old partners in Monclova land deals, were seeking volunteers to join a Federal Volunteer Army of Texas to march on Matamoros.\n\nOn January 14, Sam Houston arrived in Goliad to take command of the army that Grant and Johnson had recruited. He soon discovered that Grant and Johnson had established themselves as commanders of the army. Houston went along with the Texian army, instilling camaraderie as they reached Refugio, Texas. In Refugio he approached the soldiers, telling them how a small army could not conquer a city of 12,000 and thereby convinced over half of the men to quit. That same day, Houston would receive word that he had been removed by the council as commander of the army and had been replaced by James Fannin. Houston left the army and traveled to negotiate with the Cherokees in the eastern region of Texas. For several months it was unclear if Grant, Fannin, Johnson, or Houston was in charge of the Texian army.\n\nIn the early spring of 1836, Grant and Frank W. Johnson continued their quest towards Matamoros. As co-commanders of the Matamoros Expedition with about 70 to 100 men, they went as far as San Patricio to gather horses for their expedition. Grant was informed that Mexican Captain Nicolás Rodríguez and a small company formerly from Fort Lipantitlán was in the area. Grant confronted and overtook them, confiscated their horses and took the men as prisoners to San Patricio. Within a few days the prisoners had escaped, alerting Mexican forces. Splitting into smaller groups, the Texians searched for mounts and supplies, proceeding all the way to Santa Rosa Ranch. Grant and a group of fifteen Texians while foraging, were attacked by members of General José de Urrea's cavalry. Grant was killed in the battle of Agua Dulce at 10:30 a.m. on March 2, 1836.\n\n"}

His father was an admiral.\n\nLe Bitoux worked as a substitute music teacher.\n\nLe Bitoux founded the Front homosexuel d'action révolutionnaire (FHAR) in Nice in the 1970s. By 1978, he ran for the National Assembly as a \"homosexual candidate\" alongside Guy Hocquenghem; they lost the election.\n\nIn 1979, Le Bitoux founded \"Gai pied\", the first long-running commercially published gay magazine in France; its name was coined by philosopher Michel Foucault. However, Le Bitoux stepped down in 1983 due to the magazine's increasingly consumerist orientation.\n\nLe Bitoux joined AIDES, an HIV/AIDS awareness non-profit organization, in 1985. He co-wrote many HIV prevention documents. He was the editor-in-chief of the \"Journal du Sida\", a publication about HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn 1989, Le Bitoux founded the Mémorial de la Déportation Homosexuelle, a nonprofit organization for the remembrance of homosexuals victims of Nazi Germany9. Initially, the organization was met with homophobia from some Holocaust survivors, who wrongly feared they were being smeared. In 1994, Le Bitoux co-authored the memoir of Pierre Seel, a French homosexual who was deported by the Nazis for being gay.\n\nBy the 1990s, Le Bitoux argued that anti-LGBT legislations in France harked back to laws devised by François Darlan of the Vichy government to end same-sex prostitution in 1942, not Nazi Germany. However, Marc Boninchi, a Law professor at the University of Lyon, has argued that the first instance of legal discrimination dates back to prosecutor Charles Dubost's 1941 recommendations. Meanwhile, Le Bitoux's 2002 \"Les oubliés de la mémoire\" led President Jacques Chirac to acknowledge the homosexual victims of World War II.\n\nLe Bitoux was a co-founder of the Centre LGBT Paris-Île-de-France in 1991.\n\nLe Bitoux was openly gay, and was rejected by his family for being gay. Drawn to Maoism in his early twenties, he also left due to homophobia. He contracted HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s.\n\nLe Bitoux died on 21 April 2010 in Paris, France. A memorial service conducted by Patrick Bloche was held in his honor at the city hall of the 11th arrondissement of Paris, with a performance by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. He was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\n"}

On 8 January 1836 the flag was raised at Velasco which is now part of modern Freeport, Texas. The original flag was badly damaged by accident and only shreds flew in battle.\n\nThe Georgians, who were led by William Ward, suffered a harsh fate. Though they escaped the Battle of Coleto and the capitulation of James W. Fannin's command, they were pursued by José de Urrea's cavalry. Out of ammunition, they finally surrendered and were marched back to Goliad to join the rest of Fannin's captured troops. On 27 March 1836 they were nearly all executed in the Goliad massacre.\n\nBorn in Baldwin County, Georgia on 19 February 1818, Troutman was the daughter of Hiram Bainbridge Troutman.

{"id": "1175373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1175373", "title": "Kubaba", "text": "Kubaba\n\nKubaba (in the \"Weidner\" or \"Esagila Chronicle\"; Sumerian: Kug-Bau) is the only queen on the \"Sumerian King List\", which states she reigned for 100 years – roughly in the Early Dynastic III period (ca. 2500-2330 BC) of Sumerian history. In later times, she was worshipped as a goddess.\n\nKubaba is one of very few women to have ever ruled in their own right in Iraqi history. Most versions of the king list place her alone in her own dynasty, the 3rd Dynasty of Kish, following the defeat of Sharrumiter of Mari, but other versions combine her with the 4th dynasty, that followed the primacy of the king of Akshak. Before becoming monarch, the king list says she was an alewife.\n\nThe \"Weidner Chronicle\" is a propagandistic letter, attempting to date the shrine of Marduk at Babylon to an early period, and purporting to show that each of the kings who had neglected its proper rites had lost the primacy of Sumer. It contains a brief account of rise of \"the house of Kubaba\" occurring in the reign of Puzur-Nirah of Akshak: \n\n\"In the reign of Puzur-Nirah, king of Akšak, the freshwater fishermen of Esagila were catching fish for the meal of the great lord Marduk; the officers of the king took away the fish. The fisherman was fishing when 7 (or 8) days had passed [...] in the house of Kubaba, the tavern-keeper [...] they brought to Esagila. At that time BROKEN[4] anew for Esagila [...] Kubaba gave bread to the fisherman and gave water, she made him offer the fish to Esagila. Marduk, the king, the prince of the Apsû, favored her and said: \"Let it be so!\" He entrusted to Kubaba, the tavern-keeper, sovereignty over the whole world.\" \nHer son Puzur-Suen and grandson Ur-Zababa followed her on the throne in Sumer as the fourth Kish dynasty on the king list, in some copies as her direct successors, in others with the Akshak dynasty intervening. Ur-Zababa is also known as the king said to be reigning in Sumer during the youth of Sargon the Great of Akkad, who militarily brought much of the Near East under his regime shortly afterward.\n\nShrines in honour of Kubaba spread throughout Mesopotamia. In the Hurrian area, she may be identified with Kebat, or Hepat, one title of the Hurrian Mother goddess Hannahannah (from Hurrian \"hannah\", \"mother\"). Abdi-Heba was the palace mayor, ruling Jerusalem at the time of the Amarna letters (1350 BC).\n\nKubaba became the tutelary goddess who protected the ancient city of Carchemish on the upper Euphrates, in the late Hurrian/early Hittite period. Relief carvings, now at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations (Anadolu Medeniyetleri Müzesi), Ankara, show her seated, wearing a cylindrical headdress like the \"polos\" and holding probably a tympanum (hand drum) or possibly a mirror in one hand and a poppy capsule (or perhaps pomegranate) in the other. She plays a role in Luwian texts and a minor role in Hittite texts, mainly in Hurrian rituals.\n\nAccording to Emanuel Laroche, Maarten J. Vermaseren, and Mark Munn, her cult later spread and her name was adapted for the main goddess of the Hittite successor kingdoms in Anatolia. This deity later developed into the Phrygian \"matar kubileya\" (\"mother Cybele\"), who was depicted in petroglyphs and mentioned in accompanying inscriptions. The Phrygian goddess otherwise bears little resemblance to Kubaba, who – according to Herodotus – was a sovereign deity at Sardis. \n\nHer Lydian name was Kuvav or Kufav which Ionian Greeks initially transcribed Kybêbê, rather than \"Kybele\"; Jan Bremmer notes in this context the 7th century Semonides of Amorgos, who calls one of her Hellene followers a \"kybêbos\". Bremmer observes that in the following century she was further Hellenized by Hipponax, as \"Kybêbê, daughter of Zeus\".\n\n\nQueen Ku-Baba, the first female monarch in history, and the destruction of her legacy by Sargon.\n"}

He grew up performing in local theater productions along with his sister. After his sister started taking roles on Broadway, Fowler thought he might like to advance his acting career as well.\n\nMicah D. Fowler started pursuing acting at the age of 5, which led him to roles on \"Blue's Clues\" and \"Sesame Street\". He booked his role for \"Labor Day\" at age thirteen. For his most recent role, as \"JJ DiMeo\" on \"Speechless\", he found out he booked the role on his eighteenth birthday. In an interview with \"People magazine\", Fowler said it was the \"best birthday present ever!\"\n\nRegarding his role on \"Speechless\", he said it is a challenge to play JJ. Although Fowler is able to speak, the JJ character does not speak, so Fowler has to compensate with dramatic facial expressions and body movements. It's said that Fowler's humor gets the show's biggest laughs. He said he sometimes just wants to blurt out what he is feeling or saying.\n\nFowler and the character he portrays both have cerebral palsy, and he is one of few actors with a disability playing a character with a disability on primetime network television.\n\nWhen not performing, Fowler devotes his time as an ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation (CPF).

Fowler encourages, \"So the next time you watch \"Speechless\", take 10 minutes to check out their post for the night.\"\n\nWhen taking the role for \"Speechless\", Fowler had to move from New Jersey to Los Angeles. To take the role, he sacrificed by missing much of his sled hockey season and much of his senior year. He plans to attend his graduation ceremony in the spring.\n\nWhile Fowler had previously been somewhat averse to social media, after landing the role on \"Speechless\", he did join Instagram and Twitter in an effort to promote the show.\n\nGrowing up he said he was a huge fan of movies and television.

Bain disappeared on June 19, 1990, after telling her mother she was going to \"check the tennis schedule\" on campus. On June 22, her car was found with a large bloodstain in the back seat, but her body was never found.\n\nBaltovich consistently maintained his innocence throughout the trial and his lawyers suggested that the so-called \"Scarborough Rapist\", who was later identified as serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo, might be responsible for the murder. He was nonetheless convicted and served eight years in prison until Baltovich's lawyers appealed, after which Baltovich was released on bail in March 2001. In December 2004, the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the conviction. In 2005, Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney-General announced that Baltovich would face a new trial on charges of second-degree murder, at an unspecified date, but the trial never took place. With no Crown case, the judge directed the jury to make a finding of not guilty on April 22, 2008.\n\nJames Driskell was convicted for the first-degree murder of Perry Harder, whose remains were found in a shallow grave outside Winnipeg, three months after his disappearance. Driskell was linked to the crime with three hairs found in his van that supposedly belonged to Harder, but DNA tests years later found that the hairs did not belong to the victim.\n\nIn 2005, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Irwin Cotler used a special Criminal Code of Canada provision to quash the conviction, stay the charges, and order a new trial for Driskell, but the Manitoba Department of Justice decided not to order a new trial. It instead entered a stay of proceedings and called for a public inquiry, ending Driskell's conviction without exonerating him.\n\nAnthony Hanemaayer was charged for breaking and entering, and alleged assault with a weapon against a 15-year-old girl at her home in Scarborough on September 29, 1987. During the trial in 1989, the Crown decided to withdraw charges of the assault, however, Hanemaayer was still convicted and sentenced for breaking and entering charges. Hanemaayer pleaded guilty to avoid a lengthy prison sentence, and was sentenced to two years less a day in a provincial reformatory. He was released in June 1990 after serving sixteen months in prison, including eight months in pre-trial detention.\n\nAt the time of the attack in 1987, the Scarborough area was being plagued by the so-called 'Scarborough Rapist', who was later identified as serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo. He was convicted of numerous sexual assaults in Scarborough, sexual assaults elsewhere, and the murders of three girls he committed with his wife Karla Homolka.\n\nIn 2006, Bernardo confessed to the 1987 assault and provided a detailed account to investigating officers, who also interviewed Hanemaayer several weeks later but did not inform him of Bernardo's confession. Hanemaayer became aware of Bernardo's confession in late 2007, after which he appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal in June 2008. As a result, the court cleared Hanemaayer of the convictions and Justice Rosenberg stated that \"it is profoundly regrettable that errors in the justice system led to this miscarriage of justice and the devastating effect it has had on Mr. Hanemaayer and his family.\"\n\nIn June 2010, Hanemaayer commenced a $1.1 million lawsuit for damages suffered as a result of his 1989 conviction for the assault. The courts made a decision not to compensate him, however.\n\nIvan Henry was convicted of multiple sexual assaults in Vancouver, Canada from 1980 to 1982. Similar assaults continued while he was jailed, leading to further investigation by police. His conviction was overturned in 2010. Henry was imprisoned for 27 years.\n\nRéjean Hinse was convicted for aggravated robbery and sentenced to 15 years in prison for his alleged part in the armed robbery in December 1961 of a general store in Mont-Laurier, Québec. He campaigned to establish his innocence based on the fact that he had been in Montreal, over two hundred kilometres away, at the time the crime was committed. In 1997 he was acquitted by the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that evidence presented at his trial was insufficient to convict him of aggravated robbery. Hinse was awarded $13.1 million compensation, payable by the Quebec and Canadian Federal governments, the largest wrongful conviction award in Canadian history.\n\nDonald Marshall, Jr., at the time 17, was convicted of murdering acquaintance Sandy Seale in 1971 and sentenced to life in prison. The two had confronted Roy Ebsary, an older man they encountered in Wentworth Park in Sydney, Nova Scotia, during the late evening with the intent to \"roll a drunk\". A short scuffle occurred and Seale fell mortally wounded by a knife blow. Ebsary admitted that he had stabbed Seale but then lied about his role to the police who immediately focused on Marshall, who was 'known to them' from previous incidents.\n\nMarshall spent 11 years in jail before being acquitted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in 1983. A witness came forward to say he had seen another man stab Seale, and several prior witness statements pinpointing Marshall were recanted. Ebsary was subsequently tried and convicted of manslaughter.\n\nThe Martensville satanic sex scandal occurred in Martensville, Saskatchewan, in 1992 where a mother alleged that a local woman who ran a babysitting service and day care centre in her home had sexually abused her child. Police began an investigation and allegations began to snowball. More than a dozen persons, including five police officers from two different forces, ultimately faced over 100 charges connected with running a Satanic cult called The Brotherhood of The Ram, which allegedly practiced ritualized sexual abuse of numerous children at a \"Devil Church\".\n\nThe son of the day care owner was tried and found guilty, but a new investigation concluded that the original trial was motivated by 'emotional hysteria.' In 2003, defendants sued for wrongful prosecution. In 2004, Ron and Linda Sterling received $924,000 in reparations.\n\nDavid Milgaard was convicted of raping and murdering 20-year-old nursing assistant Gail Miller in 1969. When she was found on a snowbank, Milgaard and his friends, Ron Wilson and Nichol John, were picking up their friend, Albert Cadrain. Tipped off by Cadrain, who admitted he was mostly interested in the $2,000 reward for information, British Columbia police arrested Milgaard in May 1969 and sent him back to Saskatchewan where he was charged with Miller's murder. Cadrain testified that he had seen Milgaard return the night of Miller's murder in blood-stained clothing.\n\nBoth Wilson and John were also called to testify against him. They had told police that they had been with Milgaard the entire day and that they believed him to be innocent, but they changed their stories for the court. Wilson later recanted his testimony claiming that he had been told he was personally under suspicion and wanted to alleviate the pressure on himself. Milgaard was sentenced to life in prison in January 1970.\n\nMilgaard appealed his conviction several times, but was blocked both by bureaucracy and by a justice system unreceptive to those who were not willing to admit their guilt. But in July 1997, a DNA laboratory in the United Kingdom released a report confirming that semen samples on the victim's clothing did not originate with Milgaard—for all intents and purposes clearing Milgaard of the crime. The Saskatchewan government then apologized for the wrongful conviction, and Larry Fisher was arrested days later. Fisher had been living in Cadrain's basement at the time of the murder.\n\nGuy Paul Morin was a suspect in the October 1984 rape and murder of his 9-year-old next-door neighbour, Christine Jessop. Morin was found not guilty of murder at his first trial in 1986, but convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment at his second trial after the Crown appealed. Improvements in DNA testing led to a test in 1995 which excluded Morin as the murderer, after which Morin's appeal of his conviction was allowed (i.e., the conviction was reversed), and a directed verdict of acquittal entered in the appeal.\n\nWillie Nepoose was convicted in 1987 for the 1986 murder of Rose Marie Desjarlais. In 1992 the conviction was overturned when it was discovered one of the witnesses had perjured herself, the police had not disclosed some evidence, and evidence was discovered that he was with his brothers in a hotel at the time of the murder.\n\nRomeo Phillion was convicted of the 1967 murder of Ottawa firefighter Leopold Roy, after making a confession to police which he recanted two hours later. He spent 31 years in prison and five years on parole. The case was reopened in 2006, and in March 2009, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his 1972 murder conviction and granted him a new trial, in part because a 1968 police report establishing a clear alibi for Phillion had not been turned over to his defence lawyer in his original trial.\n\nThomas Sophonow was tried three times in the 1981 murder of doughnut-shop clerk Barbara Stoppel. Sophonow spent four years imprisoned but was acquitted by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in 1985.\n\nSteven Truscott, at the time 14, was convicted in 1959 for the rape and murder of 12-year-old Lynne Harper. Truscott was initially sentenced to death, but this was later commuted to life imprisonment. He continued to maintain his innocence until 2007, when his conviction was declared a miscarriage of justice and he was formally acquitted of the crime. On July 7, 2008, the government of Ontario awarded him $6.5 million in compensation.\n\nWilliam Mullins-Johnson, of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario was found guilty of the first-degree murder of his niece, Valin Johnson, after a two and half week trial in September 1994. He was convicted after a jury trial in which now-disgraced forensic pathologist Charles Smith's evidence played a major role in determining the time of death, the cause of death, and whether the girl had been sexually assaulted. Mullins-Johnson had babysat Valin, 4, and her 3-year-old brother on the evening of June 26, 1993. When the girl's mother returned home, she did not check on her daughter. At 7 a.m. the next day she found Valin dead in bed.\n\nA local pathologist performed an autopsy on Valin. Then \"consultation reports\" were sought from Smith and four other specialists, based on tissue samples and other evidence from the autopsy. Smith was the only consultant to conclude Valin was sexually assaulted at the time of death. That contradicted the defence's point that Valin, who had a history of vomiting in bed, might have died of natural causes. The jury convicted, which the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld in 1996. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed a further appeal in 1998.\n\nAttempts were made to clear his name based on available DNA technology, but the tissue could not be located by Smith, who was given the evidence by the pathologist who did the autopsy, until 2005, 11 years after the trial, when the missing tissue samples turned up in Smith’s office. William Mullins-Johnson was released on bail in 2005, pending review of his case. On July 16, 2007, a report by three expert pathologists (written unbeknownst to the lawyers working on his behalf) determined there was no evidence that the girl was sexually assaulted, and the Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant said that William Mullins-Johnson's conviction “cannot stand” and that he should be acquitted by the appeals court. On October 15, 2007 he was acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal.\n\nIn 2010, five years after filing a $13 million lawsuit for wrongful conviction, Mullins-Johnson and the Government of Ontario reached a $4.25 million out-of-court settlement.\n"}

He was considered to be the first \"modern\" artist from Indonesia (then Dutch East Indies), and his paintings corresponded with nineteenth-century romanticism which was popular in Europe at the time. He also expressed his cultural roots and inventiveness in his work.\n\nRaden Saleh Syarif Bustaman was born in 1807 in Semarang on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). He was born into a noble Hadhrami family where his father was Sayyid Husen bin Alwi bin Awal bin Yahya, an Indonesian of Arab descent. He was the grandson of Sayyid Abdullah Bustaman maternally. Raden Saleh has family connection to Habib Ali Kwitang through his sister, Roqayah, who once married to Abdurrahman (father of Ali Kwitang) but gave no offsprings.\n\nYoung Raden Saleh was first taught in Bogor by the Belgian artist A.J. Payen. Payen acknowledged the youth's talent, and persuaded the colonial government of the Netherlands to send Raden Saleh to the Netherlands to study art. He arrived in Europe in 1829 and began to study under Cornelius Kruseman and Andreas Schelfhout.\n\nIt was from Kruseman that Raden Saleh studied his skills in portraiture, and later was accepted at various European courts where he was assigned to do portraits. While in Europe, in 1836 Saleh became the first indigenous Indonesian to be initiated into Freemasonry. From 1839, he spent five years at the court of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who became an important patron.\n\nFrom Schelfhout, Raden Saleh furthered his skills as a landscape painter. Raden Saleh visited several European cities, as well as Algiers. In The Hague, a lion tamer allowed Raden Saleh to study his lion, and from that his most famous painting of animal fights was created, which subsequently brought fame to the artist. Many of his paintings were exhibited at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Several of his paintings were destroyed when the Colonial Dutch pavilion in Paris was burnt in 1931.\n\nRaden Saleh returned to Dutch East Indies in 1852, after living in Europe for 20 years. He worked as conservator for the colonial collection of government art and continued painting portraits of the Javanese aristocracy, and many more landscape paintings. Returning to Java, he expressed his uneasiness of living in the colonies, stating that \"here, people only talks about coffee and sugar, then sugar and coffee\" in one of his letters.\n\nUpon returning, Saleh built a house in Cikini (now Cikini Hospital), based on the Callenberg Castle where he had stayed during his European travels 1844. Surrounded by vast grounds, most of them were converted into public gardens in 1862, and were closed in the turn of the century. In 1960, the Taman Ismail Marzuki was built in the former gardens. The house itself is still used today as a hospital.\n\nHe married a young aristocratic woman of Yogyakarta Sultanate, Raden Ayu Danudirdja, in 1867 and subsequently moved to Bogor, where he rented a house near the Bogor Botanical Gardens with a view of Mount Salak. He later took his wife to travel in Europe, visiting countries such as the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy. His wife however contracted an illness while in Paris, the exact illness is still not known, and was so severe that they both immediately returned to Bogor. She died on 31 July 1880, following her husband's death three months earlier.\n\nOn Friday morning, 23 April 1880, Saleh suddenly fell sick. He claimed that he was poisoned by one of his servants, but later examination showed that his blood flow was disrupted due to a clot near his heart. Saleh was buried two days later in Kampung Empang, Bogor. As reported in Javanese Bode newspaper, 28 April 1880, his funeral was \"attended by various land lords and Dutch officials, and even by curious students from nearby school.\"\n\nDuring his stay in Paris, Saleh met Horace Vernet whose painting frequently took themes of African wildlife. Compared to Vernet, Saleh's painting seems to be more influenced by the romantic painter Eugène Delacroix. This could be seen in one of Saleh's work, \"Hunting Lion\", 1840, which has similar composition to Delacroix's \"Liberty Leading the People\". However, Werner Kraus, a researcher in the Southeast-Asian Art Center of Passau, German, said that Saleh \"never mentioned Delacroix. Perhaps he saw Delacroix's, and possibly Vernet's, works during an exhibition.\"\n\nRaden Saleh is particularly remembered for his historical painting, \"The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro\", which depicted the betrayal of the rebel leader Prince Diponegoro by the colonial government, thus ending the Java War in 1830. The Prince was tricked into entering Dutch custody near Magelang, believing he was there for negotiations of a possible cease-fire. He was captured through treachery and later deported.\n\nThe event had been previously painted by a Dutch painter Nicolaas Pieneman, commissioned by Lieutenant General Hendrik Merkus de Kock. It is thought that Saleh saw this painting during his stay in Europe. Saleh made significant changes in his version of the painting; Pieneman painted the scene from the right, Saleh from the left. Pieneman depicts Diponegoro with resigned expression, while in Saleh's he appears to be outraged. Pieneman gave his painting the title \"Submission of Prince Diponegoro\", while Saleh gave \"The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro\". It is known that Saleh deliberately painted Diponegoro's Dutch captors with large heads to make them appear monstrous, as opposed to the more proportionally depicted Javanese.\n\nRaden Saleh’s work has been regarded as a sign of incipient nationalism in what was then the Dutch East Indies. This can also be seen it the depiction of Diponegoro's men. Pieneman had never been to the Indies, and so depicted Diponegoro's men in a more Arabic fashion. Saleh's version has a more accurate depiction of native Javanese clothing, with some figures wearing batik and blangkon.\n\nSaleh finished this painting in 1857 and presented it to Willem III of Netherlands in The Hague. It was returned to Indonesia in 1978 as a realization of a cultural agreement between the two countries in 1969, regarding the return of cultural items which were taken, lent, or exchanged to the Dutch in the previous eras. Even though the painting did not fall under any of those categories, because Saleh presented it to the King of the Netherlands and it was never in the possession of Indonesia, it was nevertheless returned as a gift from the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, and is currently displayed at the Merdeka Palace Museum in Jakarta.\n\n"}

He specialised in Romance philology, aesthetics, the literature of the Spanish Golden Age and modernist literature. He taught at Harvard University from 1953, where he was chair of the department of Romance Languages. The second of three children, his siblings were the hematologist Emilio Lida and María Rosa Lida de Malkiel, also a philologist.\n\nLida was born to a Jewish family in Lemberg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Ukraine). His parents took the family to Buenos Aires when he was a few months old. The family spoke Yiddish as a first language, but the children became assimilated. There he grew up and received a wholly secular education. His older brother Emilio became a hematologist and his younger sister Maria Rosa Lida also became a philologist.\n\nIn 1930 Lida became an Argentine citizen, after studying his high school at the Colegio Nacional Manuel Belgrano. He obtained a university degree in the Department of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Buenos Aires, where he graduated in 1931. He became a philologist under the influence of Amado Alonso, his teacher and mentor. His interest in philosophy was influenced by Alejandro Korn and Francisco Romero. He gained his doctorate at the University of Buenos Aires with a dissertation on aesthetics and language of Santayana, published in book form in 1943, by the University of Tucumán Press.\n\nIn 1931 he began working with Alonso and Pedro Henríquez Ureña at the Instituto de Filología, and was Assistant Editor of the \"Revista de Filología Hiispánica\". He also collaborated with Victoria Ocampo in \"Sur\", and in other literary reviews. Lida taught aesthetics and literature at the National University of La Plata, and Literature at the Instituto Superior del Profesorado Secundario and at the Colegio Libre de Estudios Superiores, in Buenos Aires.\nIn 1947, to escape the conditions under Juan Peron, he took his family into exile in Mexico. He was invited by Alfonso Reyes to El Colegio de México, where he founded the foremost scholarly journal, \"Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica\", and the Center for Linguistic and Literary Studies.\n\nIn 1953, Lida succeeded his former professor Amado Alonso, who had been teaching at Harvard University since 1946. Lida became chair of the department of Romance Languages and held the Smith Chair. In addition to his own work, he published translations in Spanish of a range of scientific, philosophical and literary works, by such authors as Moritz Geiger, Karl Vossler, Helmut Hatzfeld, George Santayana, W. Dilthey and Leo Spitzer.\n\nIn 1958 he became a naturalized US citizen.\n\nLida married Leonor García (1908–1999) in 1935. They had two children: Fernando (b. 1936) and Clara Lida (b. 1941), both born in Buenos Aires. They divorced after moving to the United States.\n\nHe married a second time, to Denah Levy (1923–2007), a Spanish scholar at Brandeis University. She wrote important works on B. Pérez Galdós and a collection of Sephardic proverbs.\n\nRaimundo Lida died in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1979.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39010", "title": "Robbie Williams", "text": "Robbie Williams\n\nRobert Peter Williams (born 13 February 1974) is an English singer-songwriter and entertainer. He was a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995 and again from 2009 to 2012. He has also had commercial success as a solo artist.\n\nAfter many disagreements with the management and group members, Williams left Take That in 1995 to launch a solo career, in which all but one of his 11 studio albums reached number one in the UK. Williams also released seven number-one singles. On 15 July 2010, he rejoined Take That. The group's subsequent album \"Progress\" became the second fastest-selling album in UK chart history and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time. Gary Barlow has since confirmed that Williams had left for a second time, although the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future.\n\nHe is the best-selling British solo artist in the United Kingdom and the best selling non-Latino artist in Latin America. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the United Kingdom–four albums in the top 60–and in 2006 he entered the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for selling 1.6 million tickets of his Close Encounters Tour in a single day.\n\nWilliams has received a record eighteen Brit Awards—winning Best British Male four times, and two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the 2017 Brits Icon for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", twelve German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the \"Greatest Artist of the 1990s\". According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Williams has been certified for 19.8 million albums and 6.8 million singles in the UK as a solo artist. He is also one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold 75 million records worldwide. Williams also topped the 2000–2010 UK airplay chart, racking up almost 50% more plays than the Sugababes at number 2. In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his home town of Stoke-on-Trent, as well as having a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour.\n\nWilliams was born on 13 February 1974 in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England. His parents, Janet (\"née\" Farrell) and Peter Williams (also known as Pete Conway), ran a pub called the Red Lion in Burslem, before his father became the licensee at the Port Vale FC Social Club; this led to Williams' lifelong affinity for the team. His maternal grandfather was Irish and hailed from Kilkenny. Williams attended St Margaret Ward Catholic School in Tunstall, before attending dance school UKDDF in Tunstall. He participated in several school plays, and his biggest role was that of the Artful Dodger in a production of \"Oliver!\", the musical adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel \"Oliver Twist\".\n\nIn 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary \"\", his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member Mark Owen on the day of his audition/interview with Nigel Martin-Smith. Although the majority of the group's material was written and performed by Gary Barlow, Williams performed lead vocals on their first Top Ten hit \"Could It Be Magic\", \"I Found Heaven\", and \"Everything Changes\". However, he had conflicts with Martin-Smith over the restrictive rules for Take That members, and he began drinking more alcohol and dabbling in cocaine.\n\nIn November 1994, Williams's drug abuse had escalated; he a had near drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the MTV Europe Music Awards. According to the documentary \"For the Record\", he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by lead singer Barlow and Martin-Smith; his desire to explore hip hop and rap conflicted with the Take That's usual ballads. Barlow explained in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input.\n\nNoting Williams' increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might drop out during the group's upcoming tour, Orange and Barlow took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their Nobody Else Tour as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.\n\nShortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of Oasis at Glastonbury Festival. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with George Michael in France. However, a clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with BMG. On 27 June 1996, Williams signed with Chrysalis Records.\n\nBy March 2009, Williams had shown interest in rejoining Take That; however, the band completed their The Circus Live without him. In spite of rumours that Williams was working in New York with Take That in September that year, by the day of the Children in Need charity concert at The Royal Albert Hall in November they were still performing separately. However, both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing \"Hey Jude\".\n\nOn 15 July 2010, Williams reconciled with his former colleaguess and rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album \"Progress\" was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history. The group traveled across the UK on their Progress Live tour, which included eight nights at Wembley Stadium in London, then continued across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.\n\nIn August 2012, Take That performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Williams was due to perform with Take That but missed the performance because his wife gave birth at around the same time; the group performed as a four-piece.\n\nAlthough still officially part of the Take That, Williams chose not to return for group's seventh and eighth studio albums and their accompanying tours, focusing instead on his solo commitments. He continued to write music with his colleagues and performed with the group on several occasions since 2011's Progress tour and plans on returning for a full tour to celebrate Take That's 25th anniversary.\n\nAfter leaving Take That, Williams launched his solo career starting off in 1996 by covering George Michael's \"Freedom\", the single reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Recordings for Williams's first album began at London's Maison Rouge studios in March 1997. Shortly after his introduction to Guy Chambers, Williams released \"Old Before I Die\" which would be the first single taken from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts; however, it was largely ignored on international charts. His debut album, \"Life thru a Lens\", was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the Élysée Montmartre theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nWilliams released what would be the fourth single taken from his album. \"Angels\" became Williams' best-seller in the United Kingdom. The song, apart from becoming a hit around Europe and Latin America, caused sales of his album to skyrocket. The album remained inside the British top ten for forty weeks and spent 218 weeks there altogether, making it the 58th best selling album in UK history with sales of over 2.4 million. The album eventually managed to sell over three million copies in Europe. Williams and Chambers started writing the second album in Jamaica in early 1998. The first single, \"Millennium\", accompanied with a music video featuring Williams parodying James Bond, complete with tuxedo and references to Bond films like \"Thunderball\" and \"From Russia with Love\", became Williams' first solo number one single in the United Kingdom. It also became a top twenty hit in many European countries, Latin America and Australia.\n\nWhen the album \"I've Been Expecting You\" was released in late October 1998, it debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart. The album received more attention outside the United Kingdom, leaving its mark in the European and Latin American markets with hits such as \"No Regrets\", a collaboration with The Pet Shop Boys' singer Neil Tennant and The Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon. A cover of a track from World Party's album, \"Egyptology\", became Williams' second number one hit in the UK. Williams finished the year with a European Tour late in 1999. The album \"I've Been Expecting You\" sold almost 3 million copies in the UK and was certified 10x Platinum by the BPI. In Europe, the album sold over 4 million copies.\n\nIn 1999, Williams was signed to Capitol Records in the United States, a part of EMI. He embarked on a United States promotional tour and released his first United States and Canadian single, \"Millennium\". The album \"The Ego Has Landed\" was released in July 1999 in the United States and Canada. In the middle of promotion and the tours in 1999, Williams began work on his third studio album.\n\nThe first single taken from the album was \"Rock DJ\", a song inspired by Williams's UNICEF mentor, the late Ian Dury. The video created by Fred & Farid showed Williams in an attempt to get noticed by a group of females, first stripping and then tearing chunks of skin and muscle from his body, and caused controversy in the United Kingdom and many other countries. The video was edited by \"Top of the Pops\" for its graphic content and many other channels followed suit. The song became an instant hit, reaching number one in the UK (becoming his third number one single as a solo artist) and New Zealand. The song went on to win \"Best Song of 2000\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards, \"Best Single of the Year\" at the Brit Awards and an MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects.\n\nWhen the album, \"Sing When You're Winning\" was released in August 2000, it topped the charts in many different countries. In the UK the album was certified 2x Platinum on its first week of release. After the success of his third album, Williams wanted to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off from his tour to record \"Swing When You're Winning\", his fourth studio album. Born from his lifelong love for Frank Sinatracombined with the success of the track \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\" that he recorded for the film \"Bridget Jones' Diary\" in 2001the album was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nWilliams took the chance to duet with his long-time friend Jonathan Wilkes, \"Little Voice\" star Jane Horrocks, \"Saturday Night Live\" star Jon Lovitz, Rupert Everett and actress Nicole Kidman. The first single released from the album was a duet with Kidman, on \"Somethin' Stupid\". Originally a hit for Frank and Nancy Sinatra, the song became Williams' fifth number one hit in the UK. It eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of 2001. \"Beyond the Sea\" was featured over the credits of the film \"Finding Nemo\" in 2003 and was also released on the film's soundtrack CD. A DVD, \"Robbie Williams Live at the Albert Hall\", was released in December of that year. So far, it has become one of the best selling music DVDs in Europe, being certified 6x Platinum in the United Kingdom and 2x Platinum in Germany.\n\nIn 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI. The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. So far it is the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by Ingenious Media, a UK corporate finance advisory business. Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album. \"One Fine Day\", \"Nan's Song\", and \"Come Undone\" were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles.\nThe album's first single, \"Feel\", written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt unsatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single. When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams' biggest international hit, going number one in The Netherlands and Italy, as well as reaching the top ten in many European countries. When Williams' fifth studio album, \"Escapology\", was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world. In the United States, however, it failed to make such an impact. \"Escapology\" sold almost 2 million copies by the end of 2003 in the United Kingdom. On 1–3 August 2003, Williams played three consecutive concerts at Knebworth to 125,000 people each night, making it the biggest event in UK music history. Memorable performances included “Come Undone” where he interjected with “Britain, I’m Your Son”, and further interacted with the audience when he brought a girl up on stage. In October 2003, Williams released a live album of the concerts, \"Live at Knebworth\".\n\nIn October 2004, Williams released, \"Greatest Hits\", a retrospective of his career, and also, to reveal the new tracks he had been working on with the then-new collaborator, Stephen Duffy. \"Radio\", the compilation's first single, debuted at number one in the UK Singles Chart (becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit). When the compilation was later released it debuted at number one in the UK and was the best selling album of the year in the UK and Europe. Eight years after the release of \"Angels\", the British public voted it as the \"Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years\" at the 2005 Brit Awards.\n\nAfter touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion \"Greatest Hits\", Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the Hollywood Hills, the album was co-written by Stephen Duffy over the course of 24 months. The album \"Intensive Care\" was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became an international hit. In November 2005, Williams took home the MTV Europe Music Award for 'Best Male', but also, entered in \"The Guinness Book of World Records\" when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6 million tickets in one single day. Williams kicked off his \"Close Encounters World Tour\" in South Africa in April 2006, when he finished his European leg of the tour. 2.5 million people had seen the show, and after touring Latin America and Australia the numbers went up to 3 million.\n\nWilliams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, \"Rudebox\", on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the Pet Shop Boys, William Orbit, Soul Mekanik, Joey Negro, Mark Ronson, Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the \"NME\" 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive, but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press. The album sold 2x Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2 million making it the fastest platinum-selling album of 2006. To promote his album, Williams commissioned a series of short films. \"Goodbye to the Normals\" was directed by Jim Field Smith and features \"Burslem Normals\" by Williams.\n\nRumours of a new studio album co-written with Guy Chambers surfaced in early 2007, along with known commitments required by Williams to his EMI contract. British singer-songwriter Laura Critchley commented that she had sung vocals for three songs, and said that it would not be released until 2009.\n\nIn February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson. A spokesman said that Williams was planning to begin the recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. This will probably be the last Williams album released by EMI. On his official website, Williams confirmed that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album, which would eventually be titled \"Reality Killed the Video Star\", a reference to the song \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" by Horn's former band The Buggles. The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled \"Songbook\", as a free CD for the newspaper \"The Mail on Sunday\". The CD is a one-off album of some of his biggest hits – including several rare live performances. That same evening, Williams made his \"comeback\" on \"The X Factor\" results show, performing his new single \"Bodies\" for the first time live. On 20 October 2009 Williams opened the BBC Electric Proms at the London RoundHouse. It was his first live concert for 3 years and was broadcast across 200 cinemas worldwide. Accompanied by a string section, horn section, full band and producer Trevor Horn, Williams performed several new tracks from \"Reality Killed the Video Star\" and older tracks.\n\n\"Reality Killed the Video Star\" was previewed in the UK on the Spotify music streaming service on 6 November 2009, and official released on 9 November. In a high-profile chart battle, Williams' album was pitted against \"X Factor\" 2008 runners-up JLS who released their debut album the same day. JLS beat Williams to the number one spot by 1500 sales. The album was also released in the United States (Williams' first album to be released there since 2002's \"Escapology\"). In late November 2009, Williams travelled to Australia to perform at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009.\n\nIn October 2010, Williams released his second greatest hits album, \"\", to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist. A single, \"Shame\", was also released, which was written and sung by Williams and Barlow.\n\nOn 21 October 2011 Williams signed with Island Records (Universal Music), following his departure from his previous record label EMI in 2010.\n\nWilliams was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was co-organised by Gary Barlow, held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012. During the end of August his official website began a countdown to the release of information regarding his latest solo material, with an image of his face and his mind unveiled daily as the countdown expired. Titled \"Take the Crown\", the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart making it Williams' tenth number one album. It also marked the second time that Williams had a number one single (\"Candy\") and album at the same time on the chart. The first time was in 2001 when \"Somethin' Stupid\" and \"Swing When You're Winning\" were number one on the singles and albums chart respectively.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Candy\", premiered on 10 September 2012 and was released on 11 September in most countries and 29 October in the UK. In the UK, \"Candy\" became Williams' first number one single since \"Radio\" (2004) and his seventh solo number one single. In its first week the song has sold 137,000 copies becoming the fastest-selling male artist single of the year. On 26 November 2012 Williams announced a 17 date stadium tour of Europe. Williams also confirmed that the support act for the tour would be Olly Murs who also duets with him on \"Kids\". Universal and EMI merged in 2012, bringing Williams' Chrysalis/Virgin recordings full circle to Universal.\n\nIn September 2013, Williams announced a follow up to his 2001 swing album, titled \"Swings Both Ways\" for release in November. The album features covers and original songs, whilst also including duet recordings with Michael Bublé, Olly Murs, Rufus Wainright, Lily Allen and Kelly Clarkson. In November 2013 Williams made a cameo appearance in the video to Murs's song \"Hand on Heart\".\n\nWilliams released a compilation album entitled \"Under the Radar Volume 1\" on 1 December 2014 through his website, featuring B-sides, demos and other previously unreleased songs. An example of the latter is \"Run It Wild\" a song that he \"once got very, very excited for\" and prepared for last year's \"Take the Crown\" stadium tour. \"[These are] loads and loads of songs that I have written that I am incredibly passionate about, I want you to hear them, otherwise they are just going to remain in my computer!\" Williams claims that Guy Chambers “is not happy” about these songs being released online: \"He thinks I am a lunatic for not putting them on an album that we have promoted with TV performances and at radio stations and a big tour,\" Williams said. \"But I am an impetuous bugger, and I want them out now, now, now!\"\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that Williams had signed a recording contract with Sony Music. In a statement, Williams said: \"They’re [Sony Music] inspired, I’m inspired. I’m more ready than I ever have been and I’m totally convinced I’m in the right place. I look forward to working on this album, which is an album I’m immensely proud of, in this exciting new partnership with Sony Music.\" \"The Heavy Entertainment Show\" became his 12th UK number-one album, putting him level with Madonna. In July 2017, Williams announced a new album, \"Under the Radar Volume 2\", which was released in November 2017.\nOn 14 June 2018, Williams performed at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. Williams sang \n“Let Me Entertain You” and “Feel” before he performed a duet of “Angels” with Russian soprano Aida Garifullina. Williams then performed an encore with “Rock DJ”, during which he gave the finger. Fox in the U.S. apologised for the incident which they had broadcast live. The incident was not shown on ITV in the UK who had cut away prior to the encore. Williams appeared on \"This Morning\" on 19 June and explained what happened, “It was one minute to kick off, I was under a lot of pressure, because there was one minute left and I didn't know how I was going to do half a minute, so I just did a one-minute countdown [using his middle finger].” Asked by presenter Phillip Schofield whether he regrets it, he said: \"Yeah, of course, yeah. I cannot trust me. I don't know what I'm going to do at any time. There's no, sort of, plan. The plan was, sing in key, don't fall over. That was the plan and 99% of the plan, I pulled off.” When asked did the idea just enter his head he responded, “Nothing actually pops into my head. There's a block between me and sense... then something happens and then five minutes later, I'm like, 'Did I? Yeah, I did, didn't I?”.\n\nOn 17 July 2018, Williams along with his wife, and One Direction star Louis Tomlinson, were announced as the new judges on the fifteenth series of \"The X Factor\" in the UK, joining Simon Cowell, with the four also joined by Sharon Osbourne on the live shows.\n\nRobbie Williams collaborated with Australian pop star Kylie Minogue on the song \"Kids\". The single peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 2000 and was later selected to be part of the music of \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Williams also collaborated with Australian film star Nicole Kidman on a cover of Frank and Nancy Sinatra's \"Somethin' Stupid\". The single reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in 2001. His single \"No Regrets\" featured Neil Tennant, and Neil Hannon on backing vocals. In 2001, Williams recorded \"We Are the Champions\" with Queen for the 2001 medieval adventure film \"A Knight's Tale\".\n\nIn 2002, Williams appeared on the track \"My Culture\" on the \"1 Giant Leap\" album, alongside rapper Maxi Jazz (which features lyrics from the hidden track \"Hello Sir\" from \"Life thru a Lens\"). Williams also features on a double CD titled \"Concrete\" which was released on the same day as \"Rudebox\". The CD features a concert recorded for the BBC featuring the Pet Shop Boys and Williams singing their classic hit \"Jealousy\". Their joint effort, \"She's Madonna\", was released as a single in March 2007. On 13 August 2007, a Dean Martin duets album was released, on which Williams sings \"Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone\".\n\nIn 2010 he announced the release of \"Shame\", a duet with Take That lead singer songwriter Gary Barlow, as the first single from his greatest hits collection, \"\", which was certified silver in the UK and charted in 19 countries worldwide. In 2010, Williams and comedian/actor Russell Brand along with Frank Skinner, David Baddiel and singer-songwriter Ian Broudie (of The Lightning Seeds), under the name \"The Squad\", recorded a new version of “Three Lions”, the England football team’s song, for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In 2012, Williams recorded a duet with Mexican recording artist Thalía for the Spanish song \"Te quiero dijiste (Muñequita linda)\", included on her album \"Habítame Siempre\".\n\nIn 2005 Williams provided the voice of Dougal in the film adaption of \"The Magic Roundabout\" On 26 August 2010, it was announced Williams would become a guest vocal coach on the ninth series of German reality television show \"\" to teach candidates for a girl group.\n\nOn 20 September 2010, Williams released his second book called \"You Know Me\" in collaboration with Chris Heath.

Williams formed the club with other celebrity friends after building his own soccer pitch at his home in Los Angeles. The club was named after Williams' hometown club, Port Vale, and its logo was very similar. The club supposedly was disbanded in 2007, reportedly after Williams discovered two players had swindled him out of £200,000.\n\nIn 2011, Williams announced he was working with entrepreneur Peter Jones in developing a clothing line called Farrell in honour of his grandfather Jack Farrell. Although the business had filed for bankruptcy, it was later relaunched in 2014 with support of clothing company Primark.\n\nWilliams and Guy Chambers will provide the music and lyrics (with a book by Mark Ravenhill) for the upcoming stage adaptation of David Walliams' children's book \"The Boy in the Dress\". The musical will be produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company where it will premiere in Stratford-upon-Avon for the Christmas 2019 season (before an anticipated transfer to London's West End in 2020).\n\nIt has been claimed that Williams has sold more albums in the UK than any other British solo artist in history and has won more BRIT Awards than any other artist to date. His records sales stands at over 77 million worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. Williams was entered in \"The Guinness Book of World Records\" when, after he announced his World Tour for 2006, 1.6 million tickets were sold in one day.\n\nCaroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" wrote Williams is “a perfect meeting of ego, self-deprecation and hits”, adding “there really is nobody else, in pop music anyway, who combines monumental hamminess and bone-deep vulnerability quite so effectively.”\n\nHe has been presented many awards, including a record eighteen Brit Awards—Best British Male four times, and two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the 2017 Brits Icon for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", and eight German ECHO awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, after being voted as the Greatest artist of the 1990s. He appeared in the 2009 edition of the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" when his sell-out show at the BBC Electric Proms at London's Roundhouse was screened by more than 250 cinemas across 23 countries to set a new record for the most simultaneous cinematic screenings of a live concert. Williams appears in the list of the all-time Top 100 biggest selling albums in the UK six times–with four albums in the top 60.\n\nIn 2005, the British public voted “Angels” the song they would most like played at their funeral. In October 2009, it was announced that he would receive the Outstanding Contribution to British Music award at the 2010 Brit Awards. In September 2010, Williams switched on the Blackpool illuminations, stating that it was one of the greatest honours he had achieved. In October, Media Control named Williams the most successful album-artist of the millennium due to the fact that he had spent No. 1 on the German Albums Chart for 38 weeks since 2000. He also reached that chart's Top Ten 135 times.\n\nSince 2006, Williams has spent most of his time in Los Angeles. He briefly moved back to the UK in 2009 when he bought an £8.5 million mansion in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, nearby to close friend Jonathan Wilkes who lives in Swindon, but sold the property a year later to move back to Los Angeles. In 2017 he sold his mansion in Beverly Hills for $9.9 million to DJ Khaled. In 2016 he moved into a £17 million mansion in Kensington, West London. His next door neighbour in London is Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. In a long-running planning battle between the two musicians, Page delayed Williams' plans for an underground swimming pool in 2018, stating construction work would damage his listed mansion, Tower House.\n\nWilliams has reportedly battled mental illness, obesity, self-esteem issues, alcoholism, and substance abuse throughout his life. He has discussed how his friend Elton John booked him into a clinic to cope with his drug use that emerged from the depression he was experiencing while still in Take That.\n\nHe revealed in 2011 he had been battling lethargy caused by a type of hormone imbalance called andropause for a number of years and thought at first it was a return of his depression.\n\nWilliams has a strong interest in UFOs and related paranormal phenomena, and has pursued this interest during his 2007–08 sabbatical. His interest in the subject led to him taking part in a documentary for BBC Radio 4 with Jon Ronson. The documentary followed them to a UFO convention in Nevada during which Williams connected his interest in the paranormal with the desire to understand his childhood fears of his mothers interest in \"the world's mysteries, elves, demons, witchcraft\". Williams became an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church Monastery to officiate the wedding of friends.\n\nWilliams has a number of body tattoos, most of which are related to British culture: image of an Ace of Spades–commemorating heavy metal band Motörhead, a Fez–common headwear of comedian Tommy Cooper, logo of \"The Saint\"–tribute to Roger Moore who played the titular character on the TV show, spectacles logo of \"The Two Ronnies\"–commemorating the comedy sketch show of the TV double act of Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett, image of the “skip dance” pose of Morecambe and Wise–another TV comic double act Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, image of a Staffordshire knot–Williams ancestors are from Staffordshire, logo of his former band Take That, coat of arms of Burslem–town in Stoke-on-Trent where Williams grew up, and the notes and words of the first line of the chorus of the Beatles song “All You Need Is Love” are tattooed on his lower back.\n\nSince May 2006, Williams has been in a relationship with the American actress Ayda Field. She was featured in the UFO documentary that Williams did for BBC Radio 4 in April, and took part in a field investigation he did in Trout Lake, Washington in August 2008. There have been questions about Williams's sexuality, with some speculating that he may be bisexual. In an interview with the \"Daily Star\", he stated: \"I love musical theatre and a lot of the other things that are often associated with gays. I am 49% homosexual and sometimes as far as 50%. However, that would imply that I enjoy having a particular sort of fun, which I don't.\"\n\nOn 26 November 2009, Williams proposed to Field live on the Australian radio channel 2DayFM in an interview on \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\". A few days later Williams denied the engagement, using his official blog to say \"Hey all. We are not engaged. Rob.\" Later it was confirmed that they became engaged over Christmas. She and Williams wed at his home in Mulholland Estates in Beverly Hills on 7 August 2010.\n\nWilliams' daughter Theodora \"Teddy\" Rose was born on 18 September 2012. His second child Charlton \"Charlie\" Valentine was born on 27 October 2014. His third child Colette “Coco” Josephine Williams was born on 7 September 2018 via surrogacy.\n\nIn the 2011 \"Sunday Times Rich List\" of wealthiest people in the British music industry, his wealth was estimated at £90 million. Williams is a lifelong supporter of football club Port Vale, based in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent, and in February 2006 he bought £240,000 worth of shares in the club, making him the majority shareholder. However the club entered administration on 9 March 2012, and as a result Williams lost all of his shares in the club and received only a fraction of his original investment back.\n\nWilliams has set up a charity in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent entitled \"Give It Sum\", its goal being to \"improve local conditions and strengthen community life by giving money to those who are disadvantaged.\"\n\nWilliams, with the help of friend Jonathan Wilkes, has organised charity football matches called Soccer Aid to raise money for UNICEF UK. A mixture of celebrities and professional football players have played Soccer Aid matches in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 at Old Trafford in Manchester and Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nWilliams has been the Patron of the children's charity the Donna Louise Trust, based in Stoke-on-Trent, since 2002. The charity offers respite and palliative care to terminally ill and life-limited children who are not expected to live past the age of 16.\n\nWilliams has won various awards, with some of his more recognised accolades being the Brit Awards. He has won a record eighteen Brit Awards, which also include the Brits he won with Take That, making him the most successful artist in the history of the awards. He has also won 8 Echo Awards from the German music industry.\n\n\n\n\nAlong the tours, Robbie Williams had various members in his band.\n\n\n\n"}

He is one of Egypt's leading human rights and democracy activists, and a strong critic of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.\n\nBorn in Bedeen, Mansoura, Egypt, Ibrahim is credited for playing a leading role in the revival of Egypt's contemporary research-based civil society movement. For most of his professional career Saad Eddin Ibrahim was a professor of sociology at the American University in Cairo. He is the founder of both the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies in Cairo and the Arab Organization for Human Rights. He is married to Barbara Lethem Ibrahim. Barbara Ibrahim is the director of the Gerhart Center for Civic Engagement and Philanthropy in Cairo. The Ibrahims have two children, Randa and Amir Ibrahim. Randa has two kids Lara and Seif, and Amir has Adam and Gebriel.\n\nWell before his confrontations with the Egyptian government in the early 2000s, Ibrahim had become a controversial figure in Egypt. He reversed his earlier criticism of Anwar Sadat for his peace initiative with Israel. He gained the respect of Egypt's human rights and civil society community for championing different causes, including Copts, Bahá'ís. and other minorities at a time of rising sectarian tensions.\n\nIbrahim was arrested, imprisoned and prosecuted in 2000 for using European Union funds for election monitoring, and for allegedly defaming Egypt's image abroad. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. His defense team countered that the real motives behind the government's prosecution of Ibrahim and his assistants was his outspoken criticism of President Hosni Mubarak and his administration. He was tried twice on the same charges in State Security Courts, winning each time on appeal. During a third trial before the highest civil court in 2003, he was cleared of all charges and released, but not before a storm of international protest had put the Mubarak regime on the defensive.\n\nAs an independent-minded intellectual, Ibrahim has supported fair elections when they were viewed as incompatible with Egyptian politics, promoted international democratic alliances, and accepted NGO funding from any source that shares peaceful and democratic values, including those in the US. He has recently been under attack in the official press for calling on the U.S. Congress to condition its military aid to Egypt on improvements in the country's human rights record and the freeing of another political prisoner, Ayman Nour.\n\nIn 2006 Ibrahim was awarded the Ion Ratiu Democracy Lecture Prize at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, where he previously had been a public policy scholar. He is currently a Board member of the Arab Democracy Foundation.\n\nIbrahim taught sociology at Indiana's DePauw University from 1967 to 1974. During the academic year 2008-2009, Ibrahim lived in the United States as a professor of political sociology at Indiana University. and a visiting fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Harvard University. Ibrahim is currently the Wallerstein Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Drew University Center on Religion, Culture & Conflict in Madison, New Jersey.\n\nOn 2 August 2008, an Egyptian court sentenced Ibrahim to two years of prison for 'defaming Egypt'. He was granted a bail of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (US$1,890) and his lawyer expressed his will to appeal. It is reported that Ibrahim is currently in exile outside of Egypt, to avoid probable arrest upon his return.\n\nSources close to Ibrahim reported that he also feared assassination upon his return to Egypt. Despite these concerns, however, on Wednesday, August 5, 2010 Ibrahim returned to Cairo for a visit with his family. He was greeted warmly by friends, family and supporters at Cairo Airport. In view of persistent reports of the failing health of Hosni Mubarak, growing tensions over presidential succession in Egypt and then upcoming October, 2010 elections for the Majlis al-Sha'ab (People's Assembly), supporters of Ibrahim were concerned about his safety.\n\nAs of summer 2012 Ibrahim was living in Cairo and running the Ibn Khaldun Center.\n\n"}

{"id": "166969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166969", "title": "Slavoj Žižek", "text": "Slavoj Žižek\n\nSlavoj Žižek ( ; ; born 21 March 1949) is a Slovenian continental philosopher. He is a professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. He works in subjects including continental philosophy, political theory, cultural studies, psychoanalysis, film criticism, Marxism, Hegelianism and theology.\n\nIn 1989, Žižek published his first English text, \"The Sublime Object of Ideology\", in which he departed from traditional Marxist theory to develop a materialist conception of ideology that drew heavily on Lacanian psychoanalysis and Hegelian idealism. His early theoretical work became increasingly eclectic and political in the 1990s, dealing frequently in the critical analysis of disparate forms of popular culture and making him a popular figure of the academic left. A critic of capitalism, neoliberalism and political correctness, Žižek calls himself a political radical, and his work has been characterized as challenging orthodoxies of both the political right and the social-liberal universities.\n\nŽižek's idiosyncratic style, popular academic works, frequent magazine op-eds, and critical assimilation of high and low culture have gained him international influence, controversy, criticism and a substantial audience outside academe. In 2012, \"Foreign Policy\" listed Žižek on its list of Top 100 Global Thinkers, calling him \"a celebrity philosopher\" while elsewhere he has been dubbed the \"Elvis of cultural theory\" and \"the most dangerous philosopher in the West\". Žižek's work was chronicled in a 2005 documentary film entitled \"Zizek!\" A scholarly journal, the \"International Journal of Žižek Studies\", was founded to engage his work.\n\nŽižek was born in Ljubljana, SR Slovenia, Yugoslavia, into a middle-class family. His father Jože Žižek was an economist and civil servant from the region of Prekmurje in eastern Slovenia. His mother Vesna, native of the Gorizia Hills in the Slovenian Littoral, was an accountant in a state enterprise. His parents were atheists. He spent most of his childhood in the coastal town of Portorož, where he was exposed to Western film, theory and popular culture. When Slavoj was a teenager his family moved back to Ljubljana where he attended Bežigrad High School. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Slavoj encountered western philosophy in Zagreb. \n\nIn 1967, during an era of liberalization in Titoist Yugoslavia, Žižek enrolled at the University of Ljubljana and studied philosophy and sociology.\n\nHe had already begun reading French structuralists prior to entering university, and in 1967 he published the first translation of a text by Jacques Derrida into Slovenian. \nAn early influence at university, Božidar Debenjak, taught the philosophy of German idealism and introduced the thought of the Frankfurt School to Slovenia. Debenjak's reading of Marx's \"Das Kapital\" from the perspective of Hegel's \" Phenomenology of Spirit\" influenced many future Slovenian philosophers, including Žižek.\n\nŽižek frequented the circles of dissident intellectuals, including the Heideggerian philosophers Tine Hribar and Ivo Urbančič, and published articles in alternative magazines, such as \"Praxis\", \"Tribuna\" and \"Problemi\", which he also edited. In 1971 he accepted a job as an assistant researcher with the promise of tenure, but was dismissed after his Master's thesis was denounced by the authorities of being \"non-Marxist\". He graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1981 with a Doctor of Arts in Philosophy for his dissertation entitled \"The Theoretical and Practical Relevance of French Structuralism\".\n\nHe spent the next few years undertaking national service in the Yugoslav army in Karlovac.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Žižek edited and translated Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, and Louis Althusser. He used Jacques Lacan's work to interpret Hegelian and Marxist philosophy.\n\nIn 1985, Žižek completed a second doctorate (Doctor of Philosophy in psychoanalysis) at the University of Paris VIII under Jacques-Alain Miller and François Regnault.\n\nHe wrote the introduction to Slovene translations of G. K. Chesterton's and John Le Carré's detective novels. \nIn 1988, he published his first book dedicated entirely to film theory. He achieved international recognition as a social theorist with the 1989 publication of his first book in English, \"The Sublime Object of Ideology\".\n\nŽižek has been publishing in journals such as \"Lacanian Ink\" and \"In These Times\" in the United States, the \"New Left Review\" and \"The London Review of Books\" in the United Kingdom, and with the Slovenian left-liberal magazine \"Mladina\" and newspapers \"Dnevnik\" and \"Delo\". He also cooperates with the Polish leftist magazine \"Krytyka Polityczna\", regional southeast European left-wing journal \"Novi Plamen\", and serves on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical journal \"Problemi\". Žižek is a series editor of the Northwestern University Press series Diaeresis that publishes works that \"deal not only with philosophy, but also will intervene at the levels of ideology critique, politics, and art theory.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, Žižek came to public attention as a columnist for the alternative youth magazine \"Mladina\", which was critical of Tito's policies, Yugoslav politics, especially the militarization of society. He was a member of the Communist Party of Slovenia until October 1988, when he quit in protest against the JBTZ trial together with 32 other Slovenian intellectuals. Between 1988 and 1990, he was actively involved in several political and civil society movements which fought for the democratization of Slovenia, most notably the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights. In the first free elections in 1990, he ran as the Liberal Democratic Party's candidate for Slovenian presidency (an office formally abolished in the 1991 constitution).\n\nDespite his activity in liberal democratic projects, Žižek has remained committed to the communist ideal and has been critical of right-wing circles, such as nationalists, conservatives, and classical liberals both in Slovenia and worldwide. He wrote that the convention center in which nationalist Slovene writers hold their conventions should be blown up, adding, \"Since we live in the time without any sense of irony, I must add I don't mean it literally.\" Similarly, he jokingly made the following comment in May 2013, during Subversive Festival: \"If they don't support SYRIZA, then, in my vision of the democratic future, all these people will get from me [is] a first-class one-way ticket to [a] gulag.\" In response, the right-wing New Democracy party claimed Žižek's comments should be understood literally, not ironically.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Amy Goodman on \"Democracy Now!\", he described himself as a \"communist in a qualified sense,\" and in another appearance in October 2009 he described himself as a \"radical leftist.\" The following year Žižek appeared in the Arte documentary \"Marx Reloaded\" in which he defended the idea of communism.\n\nIn 2013, he corresponded with imprisoned Russian activist and Pussy Riot member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova. In 2016, during a conversation with Gary Younge at a Guardian Live event\",\" Žižek endorsed Donald Trump for the US presidency. He described Trump as a paradox, basically a centrist liberal in most of his positions, desperately trying to mask this by dirty jokes and stupidities. In an opinion piece, published e.g. in \"Die Zeit\", he described Hillary Clinton as the much less suitable alternative. The inaccuracy and contradictory nature of this position served to further damage his credibility as a political commentator. In an interview with the BBC, Žižek did however state that he thought Trump was \"horrible\" and his support would have been based on an attempt to encourage the Democratic Party to return to more centrist ideas and adopt more leftist ideas too.\n\nJust before the 2017 French presidential election, Žižek stated that one could not choose between Macron and Le Pen, arguing that the neoliberalism of Macron just gives rise to neofascism anyway. This was in response to many on the left calling for support for Macron to prevent a Le Pen victory.\n\nIn 2003, Žižek wrote text to accompany Bruce Weber's photographs in a catalog for Abercrombie & Fitch. Questioned as to the seemliness of a major intellectual writing ad copy, Žižek told \"The Boston Globe\", \"If I were asked to choose between doing things like this to earn money and becoming fully employed as an American academic, kissing ass to get a tenured post, I would with pleasure choose writing for such journals!\"\n\nŽižek and his thought have been the subject of several documentaries. The 1996 \"Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!\" is a German documentary on him. In the 2004 \"The Reality of the Virtual\", Žižek gave a one-hour lecture on his interpretation of Lacan's tripartite thesis of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real. \"Zizek!\" is a 2005 documentary by Astra Taylor on his philosophy. The 2006 \"The Pervert's Guide to Cinema\" and 2012 \"The Pervert's Guide to Ideology\" also portray Žižek's ideas and cultural criticism. \"Examined Life\" (2008) features Žižek speaking about his conception of ecology at a garbage dump. He was also featured in the 2011 \"Marx Reloaded\", directed by Jason Barker.\n\n\"Foreign Policy\" named Žižek one of its 2012 Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for giving voice to an era of absurdity.\"\n\nŽižek has been married three times: firstly, to Renata Salecl, another Slovene philosopher; secondly, to fashion model Analia Hounie, daughter of an Argentine Lacanian psychoanalyst; and thirdly, to the Slovene journalist Jela Krečič, daughter of the architectural historian Peter Krečič. He has a son.\n\nHe is a fluent speaker of Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, French, German and English. He claims to be more or less fluent in Spanish.\n\nHis body of writing spans dense theoretical polemics, academic tomes, and accessible introductory books; in addition, he has taken part in various film projects, including two documentary collaborations with director Sophie Fiennes, \"The Pervert's Guide to Cinema\" (2006) and \"The Pervert's Guide to Ideology\" (2012). His work has impacted both academic and widespread public audiences (see for example his commentary in the 2003 Abercrombie and Fitch Quarterly).\n\nHundreds of academics have addressed aspects of Žižek's work in professional papers, and in 2007, the \"International Journal of Žižek Studies\" was established for the discussion of his work.\n\nŽižek argues:\n\nDrawing on Lacan's notion of the barred subject, the subject is a purely negative entity, a void of negativity (in the Hegelian sense), which allows for the flexibility and reflexivity of the Cartesian cogito (transcendental subject). Though consciousness is opaque (following Hegel), the epistemological gap between the In-itself and For-itself is immanent to reality itself;. The antinomies of Kant, quantum physics, and Alain Badiou's 'materialist' principle that 'The One is Not', point towards an inconsistent (\"Barred\") Real itself (that Lacan conceptualized prior).\n\nAlthough there are multiple Symbolic interpretations of the Real, they are not all relatively \"true\". Two instances of the Real can be identified: the abject Real (or \"real Real\"), which cannot be wholly integrated into the symbolic order, and the symbolic Real, a set of signifiers that can never be properly integrated into the horizon of sense of a subject. The truth is revealed in the process of transiting the contradictions; or the real is a \"minimal difference\", the gap between the infinite judgement of a reductionist materialism and experience as lived, the \"Parallax\" of dialectical antagonisms are inherent to reality itself and dialectical materialism (contra Friedrich Engels) is a new materialist Hegelianism, incorporating the insights of Lacanian psychoanalysis, set theory, quantum physics, and contemporary continental philosophy.\n\nŽižek argues:\n\nThere are two main themes of critique of Žižek's ideas: his failure to articulate an alternative or program in the face of his denunciation of contemporary social, political, and economic arrangements, and his lack of rigor in argumentation.\n\nŽižek's philosophical and political positions are not always clear, and his work has been criticized for a failure to take a consistent stance. While he has claimed to stand by a revolutionary Marxist project, his lack of vision concerning the possible circumstances which could lead to successful revolution makes it unclear what that project consists of. According to John Gray and John Holbo, his theoretical argument often lacks grounding in historical fact, which makes him more provocative than insightful.\n\nRoger Scruton has written in \"Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left\", \"To summarize Žižek's position is not easy: he slips between philosophical and psychoanalytical ways of arguing, and is spell-bound by Lacan's gnomic utterances. He is a lover of paradox, and believes strongly in what Hegel called 'the labour of the negative' though taking the idea, as always, one stage further towards the brick wall of paradox\".\n\nŽižek's refusal to present an alternative vision has led critics to accuse him of using unsustainable Marxist categories of analysis and having a 19th-century understanding of class. For example, Ernesto Laclau argued that \"Žižek uses class as a sort of \"deus ex machina\" to play the role of the good guy against the multicultural devils.\" The use of such analysis, however, is not systematic and draws on critical accounts of Stalinism and Maoism, as well as post-structuralism and Lacanian psychoanalysis.\n\nŽižek does not agree with critics who claim he believes in a historical necessity:\nThere is no such thing as the Communist big Other, there's no historical necessity or teleology directing and guiding our actions. (In Slovene: \"Ni komunističnega velikega Drugega, nobene zgodovinske nujnosti ali teleologije, ki bi usmerjala in vodila naša dejanja\".)\n\nIn his book \"Living in the End Times\", Žižek suggests that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral: [...] I am attacked for being anti-Semitic \"and\" for spreading Zionist lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist \"and\" unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror \"and\" for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so maybe, just maybe I am on right path, the path of fidelity to freedom.\"\n\nCritics complain of a theoretical chaos in which questions and answers are confused and in which Žižek constantly recycles old ideas which were scientifically refuted long ago or which in reality have quite a different meaning than Žižek gives to them. Harpham calls Žižek's style \"a stream of nonconsecutive units arranged in arbitrary sequences that solicit a sporadic and discontinuous attention.\" O'Neill concurs: \"a dizzying array of wildly entertaining and often quite maddening rhetorical strategies are deployed in order to beguile, browbeat, dumbfound, dazzle, confuse, mislead, overwhelm, and generally subdue the reader into acceptance.\"\n\nSuch presentation has laid him open to accusations of misreading other philosophers, particularly Jacques Lacan and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Žižek carries over many concepts from Lacan's teachings into the sphere of political and social theory, but has a tendency to do so in an extreme deviation from its psychoanalytic context. Similarly, according to some critics, Žižek's conflation of Lacan's unconscious with Hegel's unconscious is mistaken. Noah Horwitz, in an effort to dissociate Lacan from Hegel, interprets the Lacanian unconscious and the Hegelian unconscious as two totally different mechanisms. Horwitz points out, in Lacan and Hegel's differing approaches to the topic of speech, that Lacan's unconscious reveals itself to us in parapraxis, or \"slips-of-the-tongue\". We are therefore, according to Lacan, alienated from language through the revelation of our desire (even if that desire originated with the Other, as he claims, it remains peculiar to us). In Hegel's unconscious, however, we are alienated from language whenever we attempt to articulate a particular and end up articulating a universal. For example, if I say 'the dog is with me', although I am trying to say something about this particular dog at this particular time, I actually produce the universal category 'dog', and therefore express a generality, not the particularity I desire. Hegel's argument implies that, at the level of sense-certainty, we can never express the true nature of reality. Lacan's argument implies, to the contrary, that speech reveals the true structure of a particular unconscious mind.\n\nIn a very negative review of Žižek's magnum opus \"Less than Nothing\", the British political philosopher John Gray attacked Žižek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his ‘formless radicalism’ which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that Žižek's work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: 'Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, Žižek's work amounts in the end to less than nothing.'\n\nŽižek's tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of self-plagiarism by \"The New York Times\" in 2014, after Žižek published \nan op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book. In response, Žižek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, American weekly newsmagazine \"Newsweek\" reported that in an article published in 2006 Žižek plagiarized substantial passages from an earlier review that first appeared in the journal \"American Renaissance\", a publication condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the organ of a \"white nationalist hate group.\" However, in response to the allegations, Žižek stated:\nWhen I was writing the text on Derrida which contains the problematic passages, a friend told me about Kevin Macdonald's theories, and I asked him to send me a brief resume. The friend send [sic] it to me, assuring me that I can use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that – and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book. [...] As any reader can quickly establish, the problematic passages are purely informative, a report on another's theory for which I have no affinity whatsoever; all I do after this brief resume is quickly dismissing Macdonald's theory as a new chapter in the long process of the destruction of Reason. In no way can I thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of \"stealing ideas\".

She is popular in many Buddhist countries and is a subject in Buddhist legends and art. Originally an Indian bodhisattva, her popularity has spread to southern Buddhist countries. Her popularity, however, peaks in Nepal where she has a strong following among the Buddhist Newars of the Kathmandu Valley and is thus a central figure in Newar Buddhism. She is named Shiskar Apa in Lahul and Spiti. She is related to Hindu great goddess Lakshmi, and her Sanskrit name Vasundhara indicates she is the source of the eight \"bountiful Vasus.\" Therefore, according to the epic Mahabharat, she is the bounty that is the waters of the river Ganges—the goddess, Ganga whose origin is the snows of the Himalayas.\n\nHer short mantra is \"oṃ Vasudhāre svāhā\".\n\nIn Burmese Buddhism, the water ceremony, called \"yay zet cha\", which involves the ceremonial pouring of water from a glass into a vase, drop by drop, concludes most Buddhist ceremonies including donation celebrations and feasts. This ceremonial libation is done to share the accrued merit with all other living beings in all 31 planes of existence. While the water is poured, a confession of faith, called the \"hsu taung imaya dhammanu\", is recited and led by the monks. Then, the merit is distributed by the donors, called \"ahmya wei\" by saying \"Ahmya ahmya ahmya yu daw mu gya ba gon law\" three times, with the audience responding \"thadu\", Pali for \"well done.\" The earth goddess Vasudhara is invoked to witness these meritorious deeds. Afterward, the libated water is poured on soil outside, to return the water to Vasudhara.\n\nHer mantra is \"Om Shri Vasudhara Ratna Nidhana Kashetri Soha\", when one takes up Vasudhara practice, 800 mantras (8 rounds of a mala) should be recited on the first day, then 300 mantras (3 rounds of a mala) on every day afterwards, one mala's worth of mantras in the morning, when time permits before work, another mala's worth of mantras when time permits in the late afternoon/evening, perhaps after work, the final mala's worth of mantras before sleeping, or 3 malas all at once any time of the day. It is said that devotees will accumulate 7 kinds of prosperity - wealth, quality, offspring, long life, happiness, praise and wisdom, enabling her devotess to be better equipped to practise generosity, in itself a cause for wealth, as well as having enough resources to be able to engage in spiritual practices. It also believed her practise leads to Enlightenment.\n\nThe origin of Vasudhārā in Buddhism appears in the Buddhist text The Vasudhara Dharani. According to a legend in the text known as “The Inquiry of the Layman Sucandra,” an impoverished layman named Sucandra approaches the Buddha Shakyamuni requesting a way to obtain large amounts gold, grain, silver, and gems in order to feed his large family and engage in acts of charity with the surplus fortune. Shakyamuni, aware of a mantra about the bodhisattva Vasudhara that would suit his purposes, bestows Sucandra with an incantation and religious ritual that when followed would result in good fortune and prosperity brought on by Vasudhara herself. Upon commencing the rituals and teaching them to others, Sucandra begins to prosper. Noticing his success, the monk Ananda asked Shakyamuni how he had obtained this fortune so quickly. Shakyamuni instructs Ananda to also practice the Vasudhara Dharani and “impart it to others ‘for the good of many’.”.\n\nAlthough “The Inquiry of the Layman Sucandra” seems to contradict the Buddha’s renunciation of material possessions and earthly pleasures, Shakyamuni does not instruct the monk to recite the mantra for material benefit but instead he stresses that the mantra is for “‘the good of many’ and for ‘the happiness of many’.” Thus the mantra is meant more as means of alleviating suffering rather than obtaining wealth through Vasudhara, who not only grants physical wealth and abundance but also spiritual wealth and abundance.\n\nSeveral other legends describing Vasudhara’s generosity are found in the writings of Taranatha (1575–1634), a prominent Tibetan monk and scholar. According to his history, the bodhisattva Vasudhara granted the monk Buddhajnana three hundred pearl necklaces every day. Buddhajnana was also blessed with a steady stream of buyers to purchase these necklaces. With this success, the monk was able to invest his fortune into the monastery by supporting his fellow monks and students, purchasing votive statues and ritual objects, and making generous donations to the monastery. Because he did not use the money amassed for his own personal gain, Vasudhara continued to bestow these gifts on Buddhajnana for the rest of his life.\nAnother legend in Taranatha’s history echoes the legend of “The Inquiry of the Layman Sucundra.” According to the legend, a poor philosopher was struggling to support his family. He encounters a monk devoted to the practice of meditation who teaches him the rites and rituals necessary to meditate on the goddess Vasudhara. He began the rituals and quickly prospered, receiving a large amount of land and a prestigious teaching post at a monastery. As a result, he, like the monk who had once helped him in his time of need, also shared the rites and rituals of Vasudhara with others.\n\nLike the legend of the Inquiry of the Layman Sucandra\" these legends are significant because they encourage both the lay and monastic worship of Vasudhara. In addition, they stress the importance of charity, teaching worshippers to share in their good fortune rather than amassing it for themselves.\n\nIn Buddhist art, Vasudhara has a consistent iconography. She can easily be identified as a bodhisattva by the elaborate headdress and the extensive amount of jewelry she wears. Her skin has a golden hue in bronze and painted images. This color is associated with precious metals and symbolizes opulence, fertility, and generosity in Buddhist iconography. Vasudhara is typically seated on a lotus flower base in the lalitasana, or royal pose, with one foot tucked in towards her and the other hanging of the flower base but resting on a small treasure. She can, however, also be represented in a standing position. When standing, Vasudhara has a full vase representing abundance underneath each foot. \nDespite this consistency in her representations, the number of her arms may differ from image to image. In visual representations, Vasudhara can have as few as two arms and as many as six. The two-armed representations are more common in Tibetan art and Indian art, while six-armed representations are almost exclusive to Nepalese art. Although the six-armed image originates in India, they are rare and only few examples have been found.\n\nVasudhara or Vasundhara, the 'treasure holder', is a popular Newar goddess of fertility and prosperity, and a consort of the wealth-god Jambhala. She sits in the posture of 'royal ease' on a moon disc and a pink lotus, with her left leg drawn up and her extended right foot resting (similar posture to Green Tara - showing her willingness to \"come down from her lotus throne\" to help those who call upon her) upon a white conch shell (symbolising having conquered/having perfect control of speech) and a golden treasure-vase (wealth/prosperity). She is beautiful and attractive, as youthful as a sixteen-year-old, and her golden body scintillates with radiant light. Her three beautiful and smiling faces are coloured red (right - red being the colour of controlling), golden (centre, golden being the colour of increasing), and red (left), representing perfect compassion, wisdom understanding, awareness and insight into the past, present and future, she is adorned with the five divine silks and the eight jewelled ornaments. Her first right hand makes the gesture of generosity, while her other two right hands hold the 'Three Jewels' of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, - symbolising the necessity of maintaining the commitments of refuge to the three jewels, and a golden rosary, symbolising continuous practise and self-examination, vital to enlightenment. With her three left hands she holds a small treasure-vase, for long life and intitiation, an ear of grain, for abundant harvests and earthly benefits, and a sacred text to grant wisdom. In her hands, Vasudhara holds a variety of objects attributed to her. Most representations show her holding a sheaf of corn in her left hand, symbolizing an abundant harvest. She may also be holding a gem or small treasure, a symbol of wealth. Representations with more arms, such as the six-armed Nepali representation, also depict her holding a full vase and the Book of Wisdom. With her free hands, Vasudhara performs mudras. A commonly seen mudra in paintings and figurines featuring Vasudhara is the varada mudra, also known as the charity mudra, which symbolizes the “pouring forth of divine blessings.”\nIn her 2 armed one faced form, she has a golden body, representing the earth element, Ratnasambhava in her crown, sometimes 2 eyes or 3 eyes, if with 3 eyes - representing perfect awareness, understanding, compassion, wisdom and insight into the past, present and future. Her 2 hands holding a sheaf or corn for agricultural prosperity and to \"sew the seeds\" of enlightenment, and either a single wishfulfilling jewel or a bowl of wish fulfilling jewels for wealth and wish fulfilment. \nVasudhara is the subject of numerous bronzes and paintings. She is predominantly the central figure of bronze sculptures or painted mandalas. She may also, however, appear alongside her consort, Vaiśravaṇa (Jambhala) the Buddhist God of Riches. Despite his status, she surpasses him in popularity and is more commonly the central figure of her own mandalas.\n\nVasudhara is particularly popular in Nepali Buddhism among the Buddhist Newars of the Kathmandu Valley. In this region she is a common household deity. This is known from the countless number of bronzes and paintings found representing her. These images are small in size, typically 18 cm or smaller. Because of their small size it is known that these images were primarily for private use, namely household veneration of the goddess. Additionally, there is a cult dedicated to her worship followed by the Buddhist Newars. Followers of this cult believe that her worship brings wealth and stability. Despite the strong following of this cult by the Buddhist Newars, unfortunately, it is now in decline.\n\nAs the Bodhisattva of abundance and prosperity, her popularity in this region is due to the predominance of agriculture and trade essential to the economy of the Kathmandu Valley. The Newars believe that her veneration will generally result in good fortune.\n\nOne of the earliest Nepalese representations of Vasudhara is a pauhba (textile art depicting Hindu and Buddhist images on course cotton), dating back to 1015 C.E. This pauhba is known as the Mandala of Vasudhara. The goddess is the central image of this mandala, which depicts scenes of dedication, ritual initiation, festive music, and dance associated with her worship. Its purpose is didactic (to teach). The mandala teaches the importance of worshipping Vasudhara primarily through the narrative of a non-believer whom she converted to belief.\n\nIn addition to her popularity in Nepal, Vasudhara is also an important “wealth deity” in Tibetan Buddhism. Although popular in Tibet, Vasudhara does not assume as important a role as she does in Nepalese Buddhism. In Tibet, the worship of Vasudhara is limited to mostly lay people as opposed to worship by both lay and monastic life. This is because Tibetan monastic life regards Vasudhara as a “benefactor of the laity” and instead primarily engages in the worship of the goddess Tara for all their needs. This, however, does not mean that monastic life disregards her completely. They do perform rites and rituals to the goddess habitually but it is usually at the request of a patron. She is considered to be one of the 21 Taras, also known as \"Golden/Yellow Tara\" Tibetan: Dolma Sermo, another name is Norgyunma.\n\nThe iconography of Vasudhara varies slightly in this region. In Tibetan art she appears more commonly with two arms. The six-armed representations, however, also exist and it is believed they filtered into Tibet through Nepal because of the late appearance of these images in manuscripts and art. Unlike Nepalese art, Vasudhara rarely appears alone in Tibetan art. Instead she is paired with Jambhala or appears alongside other deities. Despite these slight differences, most of her iconography remains unchanged and Vasudhara can be easily recognized by her attributes in most Buddhist art.\n\nVasudhara is often compared to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. As goddesses of wealth, both deities have a similar iconography and are worshipped for their role in an abundant harvest. Both assume a golden hue in artistic representations, perform the same mudra, and hold similar objects. For example, Vasudhara and Lakshmi are often depicted holding gems or having pots of treasure under their feet. It is believed that the convention of depicting Vasudhara standing on vases originated from earlier representations of Lakshmi. Furthermore, both goddesses are often depicted paired with their respective consorts, Lakshmi alongside Vishnu and Vasudhara alongside Jambhala.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "555483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555483", "title": "Vitali Klitschko", "text": "Vitali Klitschko\n\nVitali Volodymyrovych Klitschko (; , ; born 19 July 1971) is a Ukrainian politician and former professional boxer. He currently serves as Mayor of Kiev and head of the Kiev City State Administration, having held both offices since June 2014. Klitschko is a former leader of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc and a former Member of the Ukrainian Parliament. He became actively involved in Ukrainian politics in 2005 and combined this with his professional boxing career until his retirement from the sport in 2013.\n\nAs a boxer, Klitschko is a three-time world heavyweight champion, the second longest reigning WBC heavyweight champion of all time, has the fifth longest combined world championship reign in history at 2,735 days, the third longest individual WBC heavyweight title streak of all time at 9 consecutive defenses and the 4th longest combined title streak in the modern heavyweight history at 15 title bouts. He held the WBO title from 1999 to 2000; the \"Ring\" magazine title from 2004 to 2005; and the WBC title twice, from 2004 to 2005 and from 2008 to 2013.\n\nStanding at 2.01 metres (6 feet 7 inches), Klitschko was renowned for having exceptional ring dominance. With an 87% knockout percentage, he holds one of the highest knockout-to-fight ratios of any world champion in heavyweight boxing history, while also possessing a highly durable chin. His two losses came via a shoulder injury and a deep cut above his eye, both of which were recorded as stoppages rather than outright knockouts; in both fights he was leading on the judges' scorecards.\n\nKlitschko is the only heavyweight boxer to have reigned as world champion in three different decades. Along with Oliver McCall, he is also the only world heavyweight champion to have never been knocked down in any fight. Klitschko and George Foreman are the only heavyweight boxers in history to defend a world title after turning 40. Being the first professional boxing world champion to hold a PhD degree, and in reference to his punching power, Klitschko's nickname was \"Dr. Ironfist\". His younger brother, Wladimir, is a former unified world heavyweight champion. From 2006 until 2015, Vitali and Wladimir dominated heavyweight boxing, a period typically known as the \"Klitschko Era\" of the division.\n\nKlitschko formally began his political career in 2006 when he placed second in the Kiev mayoral race. In 2010, he founded the party Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR) and was elected into parliament for this party in 2012. He was a leading figure in the 2013–2014 Euromaidan protests, and he announced his possible candidacy for the Ukrainian presidency but later withdrew and endorsed Petro Poroshenko. He was elected Mayor of Kiev on 25 May 2014. Klitschko headed the election list of the winner of the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, the Petro Poroshenko Bloc, but he gave up his parliamentary seat to stay on as Mayor of Kiev. On 28 August 2015 the UDAR party merged into Petro Poroshenko Bloc. Klitschko thus became the new party leader. Klitschko was reelected as mayor on 15 November 2015.\n\nOriginally, Klitschko was an amateur kickboxer with a record of 34–2 with 22 knockouts.\n\nAmateur boxing record: 195 wins, 15 losses.\n\nkickboxing record: 34–2 with 22 knockouts. \n\nHe was a kickboxing world champion six times (four in professionals and two in amateurs).\n\nIn 1996, he turned boxing professional.\n\nAs an amateur, Klitschko won the super-heavyweight championship at the first World Military Games in Italy in 1995. In the same year he won a silver medal at the World Championships in Berlin, Germany, where he was defeated by Russia's Alexei Lezin in the final. In his autobiography, published in Germany in 2004, the boxer revealed that he tested positive for a banned steroid in 1996. He attributed the presence of the drug to treatment of a leg injury, but was dismissed from the Ukrainian boxing team and missed the Atlanta Olympics. His brother Wladimir moved up from heavyweight to super heavyweight to take his place in the squad and won the Olympic gold medal. His amateur record was 195–15 with 80 knockouts.\n\nKlitschko began his professional boxing career in 1996, winning his first twenty-four fights by either early knockout or technical knockout. He and Wladimir signed with the German athlete-promotion company Universum. With both brothers holding PhDs and being multilingual, their refined and articulate personalities made for mainstream marketability when they moved to Germany and Universum. In time, they became national celebrities in their adopted home country. In his 25th pro fight on 26 June 1999, Klitschko won the WBO Heavyweight title from Herbie Hide of the United Kingdom by a second-round knockout. He successfully defended the title twice. He defeated Ed Mahone by knockout in the third round and beat Obed Sullivan, who retired after the ninth round.\n\nBy April 2000 Vitali Klitschko was unbeaten and a rising star in the heavyweight division, having won all 27 of his contests by knockout. On 1 April, Klitschko had a third title defense against the American Chris Byrd, who was a late replacement. Byrd made himself a difficult target and tried to thwart Klitschko's offense by being elusive. Klitschko won most of the rounds and was heading towards a comprehensive points victory when he suffered a serious shoulder injury. After the ninth round, Klitschko notified his corner that he had a shoulder pain and threw in the towel, thus handing Klitschko his first defeat and awarding Byrd the win by RTD. At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko had won 8 of 9 rounds on one judge's scorecard, and 7 of 9 on the two others. Klitschko, who was later diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff, received much criticism for quitting the fight. Klitschko rebounded from his loss to Byrd by reeling off five victories in a row, earning himself a shot at WBC Heavyweight Champion Lennox Lewis.\n\nThe fight between Lewis and Klitschko was to take place in December 2003, and Klitschko signed for a tune-up fight on 21 June 2003 as part of the undercard of Lewis' fight with Kirk Johnson for the IBO title, as the WBC would not sanction the fight for their title. Johnson, however, pulled out of the fight due to injury and Klitschko, due to his being in training for a fight on the same day as Lewis, took the fight on short notice. Immediately after he accepted, the WBC elected to sanction the fight as a title match and Lewis' \"The Ring\" title was also up for grabs in addition to his lineal title.\n\nKlitschko, a 4–1 underdog, dominated the early going with many harder punches. He stunned Lewis in the second round with two hard rights, leaving a cut under on Lennox's left eye. In the third, Lewis landed a big right hand that opened a deep cut above Klitschko's left eye. Before the seventh round, the ringside doctor inspected the wound and deemed it severe enough to threaten eye damage if struck again, stopping the fight despite Klitschko's pleas to continue. Klitschko was ahead on all three judges' scorecards 58–56 (4 rounds to 2) at the time of the stoppage, but because the wound was a result of punches from Lewis, Lewis won by technical knockout.\n\nNegotiations for a 6 December rematch began. After negotiations collapsed, Vitali defeated Kirk Johnson in a WBC Eliminator bout on 6 December date, setting up a mandatory rematch with Lewis. In January 2004, the WBC announced that it would strip Lewis of the belt if he let pass a 15 March deadline to sign for a rematch with Vitali. Shortly thereafter, Lewis announced his retirement and vacated the title. For years after this fight, Klitschko would still occasionally call out Lewis, despite the fact that Lewis has been retired since early 2004, for a rematch.\n\nAround this time the Klitschko brothers moved from Hamburg, Germany to Los Angeles. In January 2004 they notified Universum that they would not re-sign when their contracts expired in April. Universum sued the brothers, arguing that their recent injuries had triggered a clause binding them beyond April. The suit was ultimately resolved in favor of the Klitschkos in November 2009.\n\nKlitschko faced South African Corrie Sanders on 24 April 2004 for the WBC heavyweight championship and \"The Ring\" belts that had been vacated by Lewis. Sanders had stopped younger brother Wladimir in the second round (TKO) on 8 March 2003. Klitschko took a heavy shot in round one by Sanders and almost knocked down right at the end of the round, but by using upper-body movement and accurate punching he broke down Sanders over the following rounds, forcing referee Jon Schorle to stop the bout in the eighth. Vitali landed 60% of his power punches.\n\nKlitschko's first WBC title defense was against British boxer Danny Williams. Williams had become suddenly marketable from a KO over Mike Tyson in round 4. Klitschko scored a technical knockout against Williams in 8 rounds on 11 December 2004, while wearing an orange cloth to show support for the Ukrainian presidential opposition movement. Klitschko knocked Williams down in the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 8th rounds before the fight was stopped. Immediately afterward, Klitschko dedicated his victory to democracy in his native Ukraine and also to the Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko, whom he supported in 26 December 2004, election revote.\nOn 9 November 2005, Klitschko announced his retirement from professional boxing and vacated his title. He had been training to fight Hasim Rahman, however, nine days before the fight, he injured his leg while sparring. He snapped his anterior cruciate ligament, which with surgery would take up to a year to heal and possibly prove career ending. To avoid keeping the title out of use he retired. The WBC was grateful for his consideration. On other occasions he cited regrets about his suddenly mounting injuries, a desire to leave the sport while still on top and political aspirations in his home country of Ukraine. Following his retirement, the WBC conferred \"champion emeritus\" status on Klitschko, and assured him he would become the mandatory challenger if and when he decided to return.\n\nOn 3 August 2008 the WBC awarded Klitschko a chance to regain his WBC Heavyweight title. After Vitali's retirement, his younger brother had established dominance in the division, winning two of the four world titles available. The reigning WBC Champion was Samuel Peter (who had lost a decision to Wladimir in a thrilling fight in 2005). At the time, there was interest in a potential Peter vs. Wladimir unification match. Instead, Vitali took advantage of his champion emeritus status and secured a title challenge against Peter. The fight was arranged on 11 October 2008 at O2 World, Berlin. It would be one of the most anticipated heavyweight fights in the past few years. Both men had a rightful claim to being the champion and the stakes for the future of the heavyweight division were high. Despite some questioning Vitali's decision to return after four years, he managed to regain his title in dominating fashion. Klitschko had Peter intimidated from the first round and stunned him with accurate hard punches. Klitschko kept the hard-punching Nigerian off with an effective left jab and took control in the center of the ring. Over eight rounds, Klitschko completely dismantled and outfought the younger champion. After the eighth round, Peter slumped on his stool, shook his head and asked that the bout be stopped. With the Samuel Peter victory, Klitschko technically became one of the few men to ever hold a version of the World Heavyweight Championship three times – WBO (1999–2000), WBC (2004–2005) and WBC (2008–2012).\n\nOn 21 March 2009, Klitschko defeated Juan Carlos Gómez by TKO in the ninth round. Gómez tried to use his movement to thwart Vitali, but seemed unable to cope with the power and physical strength of his opponent. As the rounds progressed, Klitschko began imposing himself on Gómez more and more. Gómez soon became wary of Klitschko's power and also began to tire physically. By the sixth round, Vitali was in total control. The end came when the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round as Gómez appeared unable to withstand any more hits.\n\nOn 26 September, Klitschko earned a one-sided TKO victory over Chris Arreola at the Staples Center in Los Angeles when Arreola's trainer, Henry Ramirez, asked the referee to stop the fight. Arreola was considered at the time one of the division's hardest punchers; however, Klitschko kept Arreola at bay with his left jab and hit him almost at will with his right. Arreola had been influenced by Samuel Peter's defeat to Klitschko in 2008, in which Peter had tried to box from the outside. He therefore employed a game-plan which involved applying constant pressure to Vitali in order to force him into a high tempo fight. Despite his best efforts, the bout became one sided very quickly. Klitschko consistently proved himself faster, sharper and much fitter than Arreola.\n\nOn 12 December, Vitali defeated Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision, winning almost every round. Johnson, a skillful fighter, tried to negate Klitschko's strength with angles and head movement. Though he proved hard to hit, he failed to launch any sustained attack of his own. After the Johnson bout, Klitschko's camp began negotiations for a potential fight with former WBA Champion Nikolai Valuev, but the match failed to materialize due to economic disagreements.\nOn 29 May 2010, Vitali Klitschko defeated Polish heavyweight contender Albert Sosnowski by KO at 2:30 in round 10 of 12. Sosnowski was knocked down by a right hand in the 10th round, prompting referee Jay Nady to immediately wave off the fight. The fight took place at Veltins-Arena, Gelsenkirchen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.\nVitali Klitschko weighed in at 112 kg (247 lbs), while Sosnowski weighed in at 110 kg (242.5 lbs).\nThis voluntary defense was Vitali's 4th defense of the WBC Heavyweight title. Sosnowski was the No. 11 ranked heavyweight according to the WBC prior to this bout.\nOn 17 August 2010, it was announced that Klitschko would defend his WBC title against Shannon Briggs on 16 October of that year. Klitschko completely dismantled his challenger with superior hand speed. Briggs struggled to land any meaningful punches, as Klitschko won every round decisively. After a few rounds, Briggs was receiving a vicious and sustained beating which caused him serious facial injuries. Considering the beating he was receiving, there was some suggestion that the referee should have stopped the bout during the last few rounds. Klitschko had retained his belt with official scores of 120–107, 120–105, and 120–107.\n\nDuring the post-fight interview, the American boxer Briggs said: \"I've fought George Foreman, I've fought Lennox Lewis, and Vitali's the best.\" While Klitschko did not knock down Briggs, the latter collapsed after the fight and was hospitalized with facial fractures and a torn biceps.\nKlitschko's next fight was against mandatory challenger Odlanier Solis. The bout was tentatively scheduled for March 2011. On 11 January, it was officially confirmed that the fight between Klitschko and Solis was going to take place in Cologne, Germany on 19 March 2011. The fight lasted less than one whole round, as a right hand to Solis's temple wobbled Solis, who then twisted his knee. Klitschko won by KO.\n\nNow aged 40, Klitschko retained his WBC heavyweight title against Tomasz Adamek on 10 September 2011 in Poland, winning by TKO in the 10th round. The referee stopped the bout after Adamek received punishing blows and was ruled out, as he was no longer able to defend himself.\n\nAfter turning 41 on 19 July 2012, Vitali became one of the oldest Heavyweight Champions in history. Despite having a four-year hiatus from the sport, Vitali has proven to be a remarkably effective and dominant Heavyweight Champion once again. Alongside his brother Wladimir, he also fights on for their shared ambition of holding all four Heavyweight Championship belts together, an ambition that was realised on 2 July 2011 when brother Wladimir defeated David Haye to win the WBA Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn January 2012, he was awarded WBC Fighter of the Year for 2011. Klitschko was in negotiations for a possible bout with former WBA Heavyweight title holder David Haye on 3 March 2012.\nAfter Wladimir Klitschko had to cancel his fight with Jean-Marc Mormeck, it was thought that Vitali was likely to fight on 25 February 2012. Sources in Germany reported that he was likely to fight British contender Dereck Chisora on 18 February 2012 in Olympiahalle, Munich, Bayern.\nIt was confirmed on 12 December 2011 that Dereck Chisora would be Vitali Klitschko's next opponent. Vitali Klitschko retained his WBC Championship belt unanimously in a dominant display in Munich. The fight was fought against a backdrop of antagonism displayed by the contender Dereck Chisora at the weigh in. Chisora slapped Klitschko across the face causing a red mark to be left. The next day Chisora spat water over the face of Vitali's brother Wladimir.\n\nVitali won the majority of the rounds boxing a disciplined fight with changing angles and superior footwork. Chisora, constantly coming forward delivering punishing body shots, failed to wear down the older man. The scores were: 118–110, 118–110, and 119–111. The next day Vitali visited a hospital to check his shoulder, claiming he injured it in the fight. A doctor confirmed a ligament tear was suffered in his left shoulder. Klitschko said he \"suddenly lost strength in the left hand\" and was forced to only use his right. The injury was believed to have happened in the second or third round. Klitschko's trainer, Fritz Zdunek, believes this is the same kind of injury Vitali suffered in his fight with Byrd.\n\nAt the post-fight press conference, a brawl ensued between Haye and Chisora. After the altercation, Chisora challenged Haye to a fight in the ring and said, \"I am going to shoot David Haye.\" Chisora was later arrested at a German airport along with his coach, Don Charles. His comments and actions were later condemned by Frank Warren, his promoter, and Wladimir Klitschko.\nOn 2 July 2012, it was announced that Vitali Klitschko will defend his WBC Heavyweight title on 8 September at the Olympic Indoor Arena in Moscow, Russia. His opponent for the fight was the then undefeated future WBA heavyweight champion Manuel Charr 21–0 (11 KO). Klitschko won the fight via technical knockout when Charr had to be stopped due to a cut received from Vitali's punches.\n\nKlitschko was expected to face Bermane Stiverne in a mandatory title defense, but was forced to pull out due to injury.\n\nOn 15 December 2013, Vitali Klitschko stepped back from boxing. He was announced champion emeritus, which means that if he wants to return to boxing, he can fight the WBC Heavyweight Champion without having any fights beforehand. But (right after his retirement from boxing), Klitschko stated \"That is something I currently cannot imagine\". The WBC title was vacated and later contested by Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne. Commenting on his decision, he stated \"My focus is on politics in Ukraine and I feel the people there need me\". He also added, \"I thank the WBC and its president Jose Sulaiman for the support in our battle for democracy and freedom in Ukraine\". Since his retirement, he has maintained a low key level of training and has been in his brother's corner for most fights, most famously when he had an altercation with Anthony Joshua after Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko.\n\nDuring the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and the following Orange Revolution, the Klitschko brothers openly supported the candidacy of Viktor Yushchenko. In 2005, (Vitali) Klitschko was appointed an adviser to President Yushchenko. In October 2006, he was promoted to full-time adviser.\n\nKlitschko began campaigning for Mayor of Kiev shortly after his retirement in 2005. He lost the 2006 mayoral election to Leonid Chernovetskyi but placed second with 26% of the vote, ahead of the incumbent Oleksandr Omelchenko Klitschko campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and lead the bloc \"Civic party\" PORA-ROP (the parties PORA and Reforms and Order Party) in the simultaneously held local elections for the Kyiv City Council. Analysts stated his relatively late entry into the campaign might have cost him votes. Still, Klitschko was elected as a people's deputy to the Kyiv City Council since \"Civic party\" PORA-ROP won 14 seats in the 2006 election. In the May 2008 Kyiv local election, he ran again and won 18% of the vote. Klitschko simultaneously led the Vitaliy Klychko Bloc that won 10.61% of the votes and 15 seats and again, he was elected into the Kyiv City Council. His campaign hired Rudy Giuliani as a consultant for the campaign. In 2008, he was also appointed to the Ukrainian delegation of the Congress of the Council of Europe.\n\nKlitschko became the leader of the political party Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR) in April 2010. During the 2010 Ukrainian local elections, the party won representatives in (Ukrainian) municipalities and Oblast Councils (regional parliaments).\n\nKlitscho and UDAR became a partner of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in November 2011. UDAR is supported by the German government and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and received support in particular from Angela Merkel and also politicians from the conservative European People's Party. According to information gained by the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\", the target was to \"set up Klitschko purposefully as a new strong man in Kiev – in order to counter this way the Kremlin's growing influence\". Support consisted in logistics, training and joint performances. Assistance was also promised by Christoph Heusgen, Ronald Pofalla and Guido Westerwelle.\nIn October 2011, Klitschko announced that he would run in the 2012 Kiev mayoral election.\n\nDuring the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Klitschko was elected (he was top candidate on UDAR's party list) into the Ukrainian parliament; when his party won 40 seats. Klitschko was chosen the leader of the party's faction in Parliament.\n\nKlitschko announced on 24 October 2013 that he intended to take part in the next Ukrainian presidential election that was then set for 2015. Experts and lawyers then argued that it was unclear if Klitschko could take part in these elections. Under Ukrainian law, a presidential candidate must have had his residence in Ukraine for the past ten years prior to election day; and Klitschko had lived for many years in Ukraine and Germany, where, according to media reports, he has a residence permit. Opinion polls since early 2011 showed that the predicted percentage of votes that Klitschko would gain in the first round of the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election enlarged from 4.8% in December 2011 to 15.1% in February 2013, and an October 2013 Razumkov Centre poll predicted 19.3%.\nKlitschko was one of the dominant figures of the Euromaidan protests. During these protests, he retired from boxing. He confirmed on 28 February 2014 that he would take part in the (early) 2014 Ukrainian presidential election. But on 29 March 2014 announced that he had changed his mind and would run for the post of Mayor of Kiev in the 2014 Kiev local election (including Mayoral elections) set for 25 May 2014. In the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election Klitschko endorsed the candidacy of Petro Poroshenko. Klitschko won Kiev's mayoral elections with almost 57% of the votes. He was sworn in as mayor on 5 June 2014. The same day the Ukrainian parliament had deprived Klitschko of his MP mandate (Ukrainian MPs are not entitled to combine parliamentary activities with any other public employment). Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine on 25 May 2014.\n\nPoroshenko appointed Klitschko as head of Kiev City State Administration on 25 June 2014.\n\nKlitschko headed the election list of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc in the late October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, but he vowed not to resign as Mayor of Kiev. On 21 November 2014 Klitschko gave up his seat in the new parliament. Petro Poroshenko Bloc won the election with 132 seats.\n\nOn 28 August 2015 the UDAR merged into Petro Poroshenko Bloc \"Solidarity\". Klitschko became the new party leader.\n\nIn the 2015 Kiev Mayoral election Klitschko was reelected with 66.5% of vote. For this he needed a second round of Mayoral elections between him and Boryslav Bereza after incumbent Klitschko scored 40.5% of the vote and Bereza 8.8% in the first round. (Bereza gained 33.51% of the vote in the second round of Mayoral elections.)\n\nKlitschko resigned as Petro Poroshenko Bloc chairman (on 26 May) after a new law barring a head of administration to be chairman or a member of a political party took effect on 1 May 2016.\n\nKlitschko is in favor of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. He sees the European Union as Ukraine's \"model for [Ukraine's] future political and economic development.\" He believes former President Viktor Yanukovych and his government were \"deliberately destroying the integration (into Europe) prospects of Ukraine\" and that Ukrainian politicians have no right to let them \"rule after 2014\". Klitschko is also in favour of NATO-Ukraine cooperation.\nKlitschko's main concern is social standards and the economy of Ukraine. He believes \"the issue of language is not the top priority\". Klitschko wants less corruption and more transparency in Ukrainian politics. He also advocates lower taxes to stimulate the economy. Klitschko did accuse in October 2011 President Yanukovych and the Azarov Government of \"doing everything to manipulate the rules to stay in power longer\"; furthermore (in December 2011) he assert(ed) \"every statement of the government\" as \"a continuation of lies and disinformation.\" He has also taken part in rallies for former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's release.\n\nIn December 2011 Klitschko described the judicial system of Ukraine as \"complete degradation\" and accused it of violating human rights and humiliating its prisoners. According to him Ukraine lacks independent and unbiased judges because \"The Ukrainian judiciary is currently a closed clan; lifelong judges and appointments through administrative leverage\". He wants to ensure the independence of judges by switching from a system of appointed judges to a system of elected judges.\n\nIn July 2012 party-leader Klitschko stated his party UDAR will not cooperate with the Party of Regions in the Ukrainian Parliament.\n\nIn early April 2013 Klitschko called for early presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine.\n\nKlitschko is a member of the International Republican Institute's International Advisory Council.\n\nKlitschko's father, Vladimir Rodionovich Klitschko (1947–2011), was a Soviet Air Force major general and a Soviet military attaché in East Germany. The elder Klitschko was also one of the commanders in charge of cleaning up the effects of the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in 1986 and was afterward diagnosed with cancer. His mother is Nadezhda Ulyanovna.\n\nKlitschko has been accused of working as a debt collector in the 1990s for mafia boss Viktor Rybalko. Klitschko has vehemently denied links to Rybalko.\n\nVitali Klitschko is married to Natalia Egorova, a former athlete and model. They met in Kiev and got married on 26 April 1996. He has three children, Yegor-Daniel, Elizabeth-Victoria and Max (named after the former World Heavyweight Champion Max Schmeling).\nIn 1996, Klitschko graduated from the Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky Pedagogical Institute (Ukraine) and was accepted into the postgraduate study program at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. On 29 February 2000, he presented his doctoral thesis on \"talent and sponsorship in sports\" at the \"Kyiv University of Physical Science and Sports\" and his PhD in Sports Science was conferred.\n\nKlitschko has lived for years in Germany (in addition to residing in Kiev). According to Klitschko \"Germany adopted me, I really love Germany, but I'm not German\".\n\nBoth Vitali and his brother are avid chess players. Vitali is a friend of former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik and the two have played, with Kramnik always winning. Vitali has commented that \"chess is similar to boxing. You need to develop a strategy, and you need to think two or three steps ahead about what your opponent is doing. You have to be smart. But what's the difference between chess and boxing? In chess, nobody is an expert, but everybody plays. In boxing everybody is an expert, but nobody fights.\"\n\nVitali and his brother also have been involved in charitable activities dedicated to supporting the needs of schools, churches and children. In 2002, the Klitschko brothers announced that they had agreed to work for UNESCO. \nVitali and his brother never fought each other in a professional fight as their mother made them promise to never fight each other .\n\n\n\n"}

She was the wife of the actor Cyril Maude.\n\nBorn into a family of actors, Emery began acting as a child. Her career grew through the 1880s and 1890s as she played leading roles in the West End of London. After a period away from the stage, she returned with leading roles in the company of Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre. She continued to act steadily in her own touring theatre company with her husband and in London theatres until 1922.\n\nEmery was born in Manchester, Lancashire, the daughter of Samuel Anderson Emery and granddaughter of John Emery, both well-known actors in their day. Her first stage appearance was in 1870, aged 8, in J. B. Buckstone's \"The Green Bushes\" at the Alexandra Theatre in Liverpool. Her first London appearance was on 23 December 1874 when she played Happy New Year in the pantomime \"Beauty and the Beast\" at the Princess's Theatre. In 1879 she joined Marie Litton's company before appearing with Wilson Barrett at the Grand Theatre in Leeds. She moved with Barrett to the Court Theatre in London in October 1879. There she was first noticed by the critics when she appeared in the one-act play \"A Clerical Error\".\n\nEmery appeared in \"A Bridal Tour\" at the Haymarket Theatre in August 1880, and performed at the St James's Theatre with Sir John Hare, William Hunter Kendal and Madge Kendal. In July 1881 she joined the company of Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre, and there she appeared in \"The Bells\" and \"The Merchant of Venice\". She later played at Toole's Theatre and at the Vaudeville Theatre with Thomas Thorne in \"The Rivals\". In 1884 she became the understudy for Ellen Terry at the Lyceum Theatre and toured the United States with Henry Irving, playing in \"Twelfth Night\", \"Much Ado about Nothing\" and \"The Merchant of Venice\". Also for Irving, in October 1885 Emery played the title role in \"Olivia\" by W. G. Wills, and toured the United States again in 1887–8.\n\nEmery married the actor Cyril Maude on 28 April 1888 at Kensington Register Office, and they had another marriage ceremony at the Savoy Chapel on 2 June 1888. She next appeared at the Vaudeville Theatre and, for Augustus Harris, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Returning to the Vaudeville Theatre in February 1890, she played the title role in \"Clarissa\", adapted by Robert Williams Buchanan from the novel by Samuel Richardson. In the same year, and at the same theatre, she played leading roles in \"The School for Scandal\" and \"She Stoops to Conquer\", among others. She starred in \"Judah\" by Henry Arthur Jones at the Shaftesbury Theatre in September 1890 before appearing at the Olympic Theatre with Wilson Barrett in December 1890.\n\nMay 1891 saw Emery back at the Shaftesbury Theatre, and in February 1892 she took the title role in the original production of Oscar Wilde's \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" at the St James's Theatre. Between 1893 and 1895 Emery played the lead female roles for J. Comyns Carr at the Comedy Theatre, where she appeared in Grundy's \"The New Woman\" and \"Sowing the Wind\" and Pinero's \"The Benefit of the Doubt\". Such was her fame by this time that her portrait was drawn by Aubrey Beardsley, appearing in the January 1895 edition of \"The Yellow Book\". In February 1896 she appeared at the Lyceum Theatre under the management of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson.\n\nIn 1896 her husband became actor-manager of the Haymarket Theatre, and Emery went with him, becoming his leading lady. However, owing to a period of illness and the birth of her son, she made just one appearance there between 1898 and 1905, in \"The Second in Command\", by Robert Marshall, in July 1901. She made her theatrical 'comeback' in February 1905, when she played Beatrice in \"Much Ado about Nothing\" opposite Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre. In January 1906 she appeared at the Waldorf Theatre as Mrs Pellender in \"The Superior Miss Pellender\". Emery formed her own theatrical company and with it she and her husband toured provincial theatres, the two of them starring in \"Olivia and Her Son\" by Horace Annesley Vachell. This play transferred to the Playhouse Theatre, then under Cyril Maude's management, in March 1907.\n\nFrom 1907 to 1922 Emery played leading roles in numerous productions at West End theatres, including the Playhouse Theatre with her husband; His Majesty's Theatre in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\"; Drury Lane in \"The Bunking of Betty\"; the St James's Theatre in T. W. Robertson's \"Caste\"; the Lyric Theatre in \"Sir Walter Ralegh\"; the Vaudeville Theatre in Pinero's \"The Schoolmistress\"; the Apollo Theatre in \"Never Say Die\" by W. H. Post, starring Charles Hawtrey (1913); the Gaiety Theatre in Maeterlinck's \"The Betrothal\", and at the Duke of York's Theatre in Pinero's \"The Enchanted Cottage\" (1922). At the Royal Command Performance in May 1911 at Drury Lane before Wilhelm II, Emery appeared in an excerpt from Bulwer-Lytton's \"Money\"; and at the Coronation Gala Performance for George V, held at His Majesty's Theatre on 27 June 1911, she played Elizabeth I in Sheridan's \"The Critic\", directed by Sir Squire Bancroft. Her last performance was at His Majesty's Theatre on 26 February 1923 in a charity production of \"The Ballad Monger\".\n\nEmery died of stomach cancer at her home in Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex, aged 62, and was buried at St Mark's Church in Bexhill.\n\nHer children with Maude included Margery Maude, who became an actress; Pamela Cynthia Maude (1893–1975); and John Cyril Maude, who became a barrister, judge and Member of Parliament. Pamela Maude married Major William La Touche Congreve VC, DSO, MC on 1 June 1916. He was killed in action on 20 July 1916 during World War I, for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. On 22 December 1919 she married Captain William Fraser, DSO, MC (1890–1964), who eventually rose to the rank of Brigadier.\n\nEmery brought up her niece, Winifred Isabel Emery (1890–1972), after the girl was abandoned by Emery's brother in 1895. This niece, together with her pupil Ruby Preece, was present when dramatist W. S. Gilbert died in his lake at Grim's Dyke in May 1911. Winifred Isabel Emery was the mother of poet David Gascoyne.\n\n"}
{"id": "7571105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7571105", "title": "Zou Rong", "text": "Zou Rong\n\nZou Rong (; 1885 – 1905) was a Chinese nationalist, racialist and revolutionary martyr of the anti-Qing movement. He was born in Chongqing, Sichuan Province, his ancestors having moved there from Meizhou, Guangdong area. Zou was sent to Japan at an early age, where he studied the successful Japanese way of modernization.\n\nWhen he returned to China, he started to write essays on how to free the Chinese nation from the Manchu regime and foreign imperialism. In 1903, he published a book on this topic: \"The Revolutionary Army\" (\"geming jun\" 革命軍). The deeply patriotic book, informed by Republicanism and Social Darwinist racial theories, was widely read and had a profound influence on the revolutionary movement. Thousands of copies of the book were distributed internationally by Sun Yat-sen in support of the revolutionary cause.\n\nZou found the Qing government unable to deal with the contemporary crisis of colonization, weakness and corruption. For Zou, the Manchu were the source of China's inability to overcome traditional obstacles for modern reforms and he analyzed their mistakes and weaknesses point by point. Moreover, he condemned China's traditional monarchical system, which had made the Han Chinese \"slaves\" rather than \"citizens.\" He was also influenced by racialist Han ideology, as evidenced in his distaste for the Manchu governing class, as he advocated “annihilation [of] the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleansing ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain, so that the soil of the Chinese subcontinent is made immaculate, and the descendants of the Yellow Emperor will all become Washingtons.”\n\nHis calls for sovereignty of the Chinese people included the establishment of a parliament, equal rights for women, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. These seemingly liberal democratic ideals were underpinned by a potentially genocidal ethnic nationalism; it was not the liberty of the individual, but the sovereignty of the ethnic nation-state (\"A man cannot live without his country\") that formed the foundations for the Republic of China as envisioned by Zou.\n\nZou lived in a foreign concession in Shanghai where he enjoyed extraterritorial rights and could not be sentenced to death by a Qing Court. Instead, he was closely associated with Zhang Binglin and implicated in the Subao incident as a result, which rendered him a prison sentence of two years; he fell ill while incarcerated and died in April 1905 at the age of 20.\n\nZou Rong; Lust, John (trans.): \"The Revolutionary Army : a Chinese Nationalist Tract of 1903.\" Paris: Mouton, 1968.\n"}
