She was an early student at both Girton College and Newnham College and one of the first two students to sit the tripos examinations in Cambridge. She entered education where she helped to create a \"women's department\" at what would be Manchester University. She wrote about women's rights and the growth of \"white blouse\" employment.\n\nBulley was born in New Brighton near Wrexham in 1852. She was one fourteen children and one of the three daughters who were unusually sent to college. Her two sisters went to the newly founded Newnham College whilst Amy went to Girton College. After three years she moved to Newnham College where she could join her sisters \nand complete a fourth year. The principal of Newnham, Anne Jemima Clough, was a friend of their parents and she had persuaded Mr and Mary Rachel Bulley to send their daughters south.\nBulley and Mary Paley were the first women to take the tripos examination at Cambridge University. The people who delivered Paley and Bulley's papers were Henry Sidgwick, John Venn, Sedley Taylor and Paley's future husband Alfred Marshall. She took the Tripos in 1874, and had she been a man then she would have been awarded a second class degree but this was denied her because she was a woman. They sat the exams in Professor Benjamin Hall Kennedy's drawing room. Paley described how Professor Kennedy would sometimes doze whilst invigilating. Paley created a sketch of Sedley Taylor delivering the exam papers.\n\nIn 1876 she became an assistant mistress at Manchester High School for Girls where she taught and in her spare time\ngave support to the growing demand for more higher education \nfor girls. The Manchester and Salford College for Women was founded in 1876. This was not an easy task as the girls involved found the work difficult as they had not been prepared for higher education. Numbers grew slowly from 46 to 50 and by 1883 there were eighty students. The college was now operating and this created sufficient pressure on the \nOwens College that it created a women's department in 1883. Bulley served as secretary to the college and despite her interventions only a few students would attend examinations because of the fear of failure. Bulley arranged for students to stay behind to have tea with her as she knew that they would normally return straight home and not enjoy any camaraderie.\n\nBulley took an interest in worker's rights when she left Manchester High School for Girls in 1886. She switched careers to journalism where she wrote for the Manchester Guardian. The switch was possible because she had already established a reputation for writing when she had written \"Middle Class Education in England\" in 1881. In 1894 she and Margaret Whitley published \"Women's Work\".\n\nIn 1907 she married Joseph Brooke who had been her dead sister Mary's husband. Three years later, her botanist brother, Arthur Bulley stood for parliament on behalf of the women's suffrage movement. When her husband died in 1912 she moved to Bushey in Hertfordshire where \nshe died in 1939.\n\n"}
{"id": "1016502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1016502", "title": "Anastacia", "text": "Anastacia\n\nAnastacia Lyn Newkirk (born September 17, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter, producer and former dancer. Her first two albums \"Not That Kind\" (2000) and \"Freak of Nature\" (2001) were released in quick succession to major success. Spurred on by the multi-platinum, global smash \"I'm Outta Love\", Anastacia was awarded as the 'World's Best-Selling New Female Pop Artist' in 2001. Her commercial success continued with international hits such as \"Paid My Dues\", \"One Day In Your Life\" and the official song of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, \"Boom\". After recovering from cancer, she returned with 2004's \"Anastacia\" which deviated from previous albums into pop-rock. Peaking at number one in 11 countries, it became Europe's second biggest selling album of the year. Its lead single \"Left Outside Alone\" remained at number one on the European \"Billboard\" chart for 15 weeks and helped Anastacia launch the most successful European tour by a solo artist that same year. The album also spawned another three singles: \"Sick and Tired\", \"Welcome to My Truth\", and \"Heavy on My Heart\".\n\nIn 2005, the multi-platinum compilation project \"Pieces of a Dream\" was released which spawned the chart topping duet with Eros Ramazzotti, \"I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)\". Her fourth studio album \"Heavy Rotation\" (2008) produced the songs \"Absolutely Positively\", \"Defeated\", and \"I Can Feel You\". Her cover album \"It's a Man's World\" (2012) was followed by a sixth studio album \"Resurrection\" (2014), which reached the top ten in the European charts. Her \"Ultimate Collection\" was released in 2015 and peaked in the top ten of the UK charts, giving the singer her sixth top ten album in Britain. In 2017, Anastacia released her new studio album \"Evolution\" and its lead single \"Caught In The Middle\". Anastacia has established herself as one of the best selling international female singers of the 2000s and 2010s. As of 2016, she has reported world-wide sales of more than\n50 million. She has had five top ten singles on U.S. \"Billboard\"'s Dance Club chart and three albums on Top Album Sales chart.\n\nKnown for her powerful mezzo-soprano voice and her small stature of , she has been dubbed \"the little lady with the big voice\". Also famed for her trademark glasses, she underwent corrective LASIK surgery in August 2005, although she still frequently wears them.\n\nDuring her life Anastacia has battled many health problems. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at age 13, breast cancer at age 34, and supraventricular tachycardia at age 39. In 2013 Anastacia was diagnosed with breast cancer for a second time. On October 1, 2013 to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Anastacia informed the media that she had undergone a double mastectomy. In recognition of her decade-long charitable efforts in breast cancer awareness, Anastacia became only the second woman to be presented with the Humanitarian Award at the \"GQ\" Men of the Year Awards in 2013.\n\nAnastacia was born in Chicago, Illinois; her late father Robert Newkirk (of German descent) was a club-singer and her mother Diane Hurley (of Irish descent) an actress on Broadway. After her father (a sufferer of bipolar disorder) left the Newkirk family, they moved to New York City when she was a teenager. Then she enrolled at the Professional Children's School in Manhattan.\n\nAnastacia was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when she was thirteen. The incurable bowel disease led to an operation where surgeons cut directly through her stomach muscles removing a foot of the singer's intestines, causing Anastacia to be wheelchair bound and needing to learn how to walk again. Despite her illness she soon became interested in dance. At age 19, a diet triggered a Crohn's relapse.\n\nDespite her ongoing health problems Anastacia continued to pursue her ambitions for the next decade. Anastacia started her career in 1983 as a dancer for hire. Her first claim to fame was as a professional dancer (dancer for hire), making regular appearances in the mid-1980s and early-90s on MTV's \"Club MTV\". She appeared in a two videos for American hip hop trio Salt-n-Pepa (\"Get Up Everybody (Get Up)\" in 1988 and \"Twist and Shout\" in 1989). In 1990, she started her musical career as a backing vocalist. She sang back-up vocals on pop star Tiffany's \"New Inside\" album in 1990. In 1991, she featured in music video \"My Fallen Angel\" of Dominican singer/actor Coro. In 1992 she gained her first break as a solo singer on BET's \"ComicView\", singing Oleta Adams' \"Get Here\". In 1993 she moved to Los Angeles to record the song \"One More Chance\" for the producer OG Pierce, it resulted however in no record deal. That same year the singer recorded a collaboration with David Morales called \"Forever Luv\", again however Anastacia failed to get a record deal. Throughout the mid 90s although producers claimed to be intrigued by her voice's unusual tone, Anastacia would be continuously told that 'her sound just didn't quite fit into any category'. In 1994, she sang back-up vocals on Jamie Foxx debut album \"Peep This\", and in 1995 Anastacia sang back-up vocals on Paula Abdul's third studio album \"Head Over Heels\". By 1997, Anastacia had become the member of a band called \"The Kraze\" which she remained a part of until 1999. In 1997 she also sung in the background choir for Kurt Carr's gospel vocal ensemble called The Kurt Carr Singers on their album \"No One Else\". She had two duet songs with Cuban composer Omar Sosa in 1998, performing \"Mi Negra, Tu Bombón\" and \"Tienes Un Solo\" in 1999. Eventually in 1998, before turning 30, Anastacia attracted the interest of record labels after making the finals of the short-lived MTV talent show \"The Cut\". Anastacia signed a contract with Daylight Records, a custom label of Sony Music Entertainment's Epic Records in March 1999.\n\nAnastacia met Lisa Braude (who later became her manager) in 1997. She encouraged her to join MTV's talent show \"The Cut\" in 1998. She made her way to be one of the ten finalists, performing her own composition entitled \"Not That Kind\". Even though she did not win the contest, she had successfully impressed some notable artists, such as Elton John and Michael Jackson as well as the show's judges that included David Foster and Faith Evans. This afterwards led her to sign with Daylight, one of Epic's labels, by March 1999. Backed up by leading American producer/writers, she released her debut album, \"Not That Kind\" on June 13, 2000. The album reached the top ten in eight countries in Europe and Asia. It went four times platinum in Europe and triple platinum in Australia; her debut single \"I'm Outta Love\" was a global smash hit in 2000, topping the charts in Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number two in France, Switzerland, Italy and Ireland as well as also reaching number six both in Germany and the UK. In the U.S., it was only a minor radio hit. The second single \"Not That Kind\" reached number 11 in the UK and became a top 10 hit in Italy. It also entered the top 20 in Switzerland and France. \"Cowboys & Kisses\" was released as the third single from the album, charting in the top forty in some European countries. As the last promotional only single, \"Made for Lovin' You\" charted in the UK at number twenty-seven and in France at number seventy-two. While \"I'm Outta Love\" was a top ten hit on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States, \"Not That Kind\" did not chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100; however by the end of the year Anastacia would go on to be the World's Best Selling New Female Pop Artist at the 2001 World Music Awards.\n\nAnastacia's second album \"Freak of Nature\", released in November 2001, achieved successful sales in the UK where it went triple platinum as well as being a hit throughout continental Europe, however unlike her debut it did not match the same level of international success. The first single released was \"Paid My Dues\". The song became an overall hit, in 2001, peaking in Denmark, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland, and reaching the top ten in several other mainland European countries. The second single, released in 2002, \"One Day in Your Life\", reached number eleven in the UK and the top ten in many European countries. The next single \"Why'd You Lie to Me\" reached the top thirty in the UK. \"You'll Never Be Alone\", the fourth single, reached number twenty-eight on the Adult Contemporary chart in the U.S. The album was finally released in the United States in May 2002. Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, who had died in a car wreck the month before, was partly responsible for Anastacia's success, since Lisa hosted MTV's \"The Cut\". Soon after she released a double disc edition featuring two bonus hits, remixes for three of the tracks on the album and two live tracks taken from a Japan gig that was performed on the September 13, 2002.\n\nAnastacia joined Celine Dion, Shakira, Cher, Dixie Chicks, and Stevie Nicks for \"VH1 Divas Live\" in 2002 and she also contributed the song \"Love Is a Crime\" to the \"Chicago\" soundtrack. The song peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart and enjoyed moderate airplay on Rhythmic/Dance format. Anastacia was also asked to sing the official song for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan and subsequently performed this at the opening ceremony.\n\nIn January 2003, Anastacia decided to have her breasts reduced because of back strain. From a routine mammogram for the surgery she discovered she had breast cancer. She immediately started and successfully completed surgery and radiotherapy. Anastacia subsequently established the Anastacia Fund to promote awareness of breast cancer among younger women. She has attributed her health scare as being an inspiration for the sound and content of her third album. According to an interview she gave in 2005 on British music station The Box, her voice lost its power and she became unable to record, and thus she spent a long time writing and trying to create a sound that she finally became happy with.\nAs stated on the Australian talk show \"Rove\" in 2004, Anastacia wanted to have more edge to her vocals as she felt there was something missing from her previous works. She brought in many rock instruments which brought a new atmosphere to her music. She also felt that she still needed the funkiness and the pop as the singer felt that too much edge would sound wrong with her voice. Out of this a new sound was formed. She describes her sound as Sprock—a combination of soul, pop, and rock. She named the album after herself.\n\nAnastacia entered record studios in September 2003 to begin recording her next album, working with Glen Ballard, Dallas Austin, and David A. Stewart for release in 2004. On the album, Anastacia also collaborated with P.O.D. lead singer Sonny Sandoval on the socially conscious track \"I Do\".\n\nThe first single, released in March, was \"Left Outside Alone\", which saw a change in direction for Anastacia. It was one of the biggest songs in Europe of 2004, reaching number one in Austria, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland; number two in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway; and number three in the United Kingdom and Hungary. Overall the song remained at number one on the European \"Billboard\" singles chart for 15 weeks. The song also topped the Australian charts, Anastacia's second number one in the country, where it went on to become the second-biggest selling single of 2004.\n\n\"Anastacia\" quickly became her most successful album to date, giving her a third consecutive triple platinum album in the UK and reaching the top of the national charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia, Greece, Germany and other countries. Unlike her first two albums, which were released in her homeland of America, \"Anastacia\" was not, despite being scheduled for release on three occasions. \"Left Outside Alone\" was released twice, but failed to pick up heavy airplay. It only gained sporadic Adult Contemporary format airplay. Again, it sparked Rhythmic/Dance format airplay and the dance mix of \"Left Outside Alone\" peaked at number five on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. After the original version of \"Left Outside Alone\" failed to catch on because of lukewarm promotion, especially on radio, the album was postponed and eventually cancelled after the release date of August 30, 2004 passed. Anastacia released three further internationally successful singles; \"Sick and Tired\" (which gave her another number one in Spain and another UK top five single), \"Welcome to My Truth\" (her best-selling hit in Spain), and the ballad \"Heavy on My Heart\", sales of which went towards the Anastacia Fund (a charitable organization providing research funding for breast cancer).\n\nA small batch of her self-titled album was released with a bonus DVD, poster and slip case. The DVD includes a making-of documentary, footage from her 2002 Europe Promo Tour, and a photo gallery. From September 2004 to August 2005, Anastacia embarked on the Live at Last Tour. In 2005 the tour was renamed the Encore Tour. The tour would become the second most popular tour of 2004 behind only U2.\n\nIn late 2005, she released her first greatest hits collection, called \"Pieces of a Dream\", named after a track of the same name. The album spawned the hit singles \"Pieces of a Dream\", which peaked at number one in Spain, and the duet with Eros Ramazzotti, \"I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)\", which was a number 1 hit in Germany, Hungary, Italy and Switzerland and a hit throughout continental Europe. Even though Sony BMG did force her to release this collection, Anastacia has said that she is happy now that it was created as it was like a \"story book\", or summary of the first six years of her career. In 2005, she was recognized for worldwide sales of over 20 million.\n\nNot long after the release of \"I Belong to You (Il Ritmo Della Passione)\", Anastacia released her first live DVD \"Live at Last\" on March 27, 2006 in Europe. The DVD contains footage from concerts in Berlin and Munich. It includes music videos to her four singles; \"Left Outside Alone\", \"Everything Burns\", \"Pieces of a Dream\", and \"I Belong to You (Il Ritmo Della Passione)\", five alternative videos (\"I Do\", \"Rearview\", \"Seasons Change\", \"Underground Army\", and \"Time\") to songs from her self-titled album, and a documentary about the tour. Soon after the DVD release Anastacia took a break from the music industry and began concentrating on her growing fashion line with s. Oliver.\n\nAnastacia attended the memorial Concert for Diana on July 1, 2007, which would have been on Diana's forty-sixth birthday. This was one of the first major events to take place in the new Wembley Stadium, and one of her first major appearances since she took a break from the industry. She opened the medley section of the show and she sang a rendition of \"Superstar\", from Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", with a gospel chorus behind her.\n\nIn August 2007, a video was put on the \"Anastacia by S. Oliver\" web site. During the video, when Anastacia was asked about her future plans, she confirmed that she was working on a new album as well as the clothing line. A specific month of release or title was not mentioned. In November 2007, her biography on the official Anastacia website was updated to say there would be a new album in 2008, with a tour to follow. During this time Anastacia began having palpitations which she believed were simple panic attacks; she was soon diagnosed with the heart condition supraventricular tachycardia. It was in this period also that Anastacia left Sony and moved to Mercury. During an interview for the UK breakfast show \"This Morning\", the singer cited that David Massey's move from Sony to Mercury was key to her own label change due to the fact that Massey had originally signed her and had been involved in all of her previous albums.\n\nOn July 24, Anastacia announced that her fourth studio album \"Heavy Rotation\" would be released October 27, 2008 in Europe and Asia (and elsewhere in 2009). The new album featured collaborations with producers Ne-Yo, The Heavyweights, Lester Mendez, J.R. Rotem, and Rodney Jerkins and was a noted departure from the pop rock sound of her previous material. The album's first single, called \"I Can Feel You\", began playing in some radio markets on August 25, 2008. The second single from \"Heavy Rotation\" was \"Absolutely Positively\", later served as a promotional single only. The third official single from the album, \"Defeated\", was released as a promotional single in Europe without a music video.\n\nHer fourth studio album proved to be less successful than her previous ones; her singles failed to reach the top 40 in her most commercially successful country (UK). Anastacia however remained positive, stating that other artists have faced the same problems while changing a record label, also blaming the world economical crisis and the label's decision to alter her sound from her own chosen sprock sound of her previous record to a more \"urban feel\". In later years Anastacia would publicly admit regret towards the change of sound, citing personal problems that led to a creative sell-out. Regardless of the lack of commercial success, the album was ranked number ten on \"Billboard\" magazine's online \"Readers' Poll: 10 Best Albums of 2008\".\n\nIn 2009, the Women's World Award presented Anastacia with the World Artist Award, recognizing the singer's success and ongoing positive influence in pop music.\n\nIn June 2009, Anastacia began her second tour throughout Europe to promote her fourth studio album. The tour was funded by the singer herself, not her label, and was well received by critics and fans alike. In November and December 2009 Anastacia, Chaka Khan and Lulu were headlining the \"Here Come the Girls\" a special Christmas concert that visited the United Kingdom only. On December 7, 2009 Anastacia opened the annual \"Royal Variety Performance\" with Lulu and Chaka Khan, performing a rendition of \"Relight My Fire\". The tour was an overall success, selling out 24 shows. In October 2009, Anastacia released a collaborative single with British band Ben's Brother entitled \"Stalemate\", which was included on the band's album \"Battling Giants\".\n\nDuring the winter of 2009, Anastacia once again joined Lulu for the Here Come the Girls Tour with Heather Small replacing Chaka Khan. In March 2010, Anastacia again entered the recording studio. Around this time, she also headlined several shows at Art on Ice in Zürich, the Hallenstadion and Lausanne. Her official website stated about the show: \"In a unique, groundbreaking combination of Olympic-level figure skating and smash hit pop, the music of Anastacia will soundtrack and seamlessly inspire a performance from some of the world's best figure skaters, perfectly choreographed to complement her hits.\" During the summer of 2010 Anastacia also became one of the main judges on British talent series \"Don't Stop Believing\", a contest inspired by the musical comedy-drama \"Glee\". During promotion for the reality show the singer noted that she had left Mercury Records and was currently with no label. Following \"Stalemate\", Anastacia released \"Safety\", a duet with Russian singer Dima Bilan, was recorded in Los Angeles in May 2010. The song was performed live for the first time at the Muz-TV Music Awards Moscow in June 2010. The song was released as a single in Russia in August 2010.

Her appearance on the show was heavily praised with sources stating that she had \"great chemistry\" with the others and had greatly impressed the producers, causing speculation that the singer would become the new fourth judge. However it was later revealed that the singer was forced to reject the judging offer due to contractual agreements regarding the Night of the Proms European winter tour as well of the release of her independent cover album.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Anastacia toured throughout Europe.\n\nIn July 2012, Anastacia announced on her Twitter page (and Facebook fan page) the release of a new commercial single for car company Škoda Auto.

Global distribution is expected to be achieved via a range of partnering labels and distribution services. The deal included the release of her following two albums, \"It's a Man's World\", a collection of covers of songs by male rock artists released on November 9, 2012, followed by an album of original material.\n\nThroughout November and December 2012 Anastacia took part in the annual Night of the Proms, a series of concerts held in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany which combine classical music with famous pop songs.

Anastacia later confirmed via her Twitter account that she was writing and recording songs for her sixth studio album, including working with producers John Fields and Steve Diamond. She also stated it would mark a return to her \"sprock\" sound.\n\nThe album, entitled \"Resurrection\", was released in May 2014 and was met with both critical and commercial success, giving the singer her sixth top ten Italian album and fifth top ten UK album. It also reached the top 5 of the Swiss and German charts and the top ten of the Dutch charts. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive, acknowledging a return to form from the singer as well as a creative resurgence. The lead single \"Stupid Little Things\" was released on April 4. Although only moderately successful, reaching the top ten in Belgium and top 20 in Italy it was quickly met with a positive reaction from music critics, with MTV's Brad Stern naming it one of the \"5 Must-Hear Pop Songs of the Week!\" and calling it a \"return to form\" for the \"pop princess and proof that Anastacia's a true survivor\", after her second battle with breast cancer. On April 12 Anastacia was given the German Radio Regenbogen Award for Charity and Entertainment.

Partnered with dancer Brendan Cole, the couple were voted in the bottom two to complete in the dance-off in the show's second week. A doctor ruled that Anastacia was unable to compete because of an injury sustained during the previous day's performance, and instead the result was decided by selecting the competitor with the higher number of audience votes. The decision was controversial, resulting in a number of complaints, and one judge is said to have threatened to quit over it. She was eliminated from the show in its sixth week.\n\nIn June 2017, she supported Lionel Richie in some of the UK dates of his All The Hits Tour.

{"id": "1763112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1763112", "title": "Andrew Kehoe", "text": "Andrew Kehoe\n\nAndrew Philip Kehoe (February 1, 1872 – May 18, 1927) was an American farmer and treasurer of his township school board, notable as a mass murderer for killing his wife and 43 other people (including 38 children), and injuring 58 people by setting off bombs in the Bath School disaster on May 18, 1927. He committed suicide near the school by detonating dynamite in his truck, causing an explosion which killed several other people and wounded more. He had earlier set off incendiary devices in his house and farm, destroying all the buildings, as well as killing two horses and other animals.\n\nKehoe was born in Tecumseh, Michigan, among the younger of a family of 13 children. His parents were Philip Kehoe (1833–1915) and Mary (McGovern) Kehoe (1835–1890). He attended Tecumseh High School and Michigan State College (later Michigan State University), where he studied electrical engineering. There, he first met his future wife, Ellen \"Nellie\" Price, the daughter of a wealthy Lansing family.\n\nAfter college, Kehoe went south west, apparently working for several years as an electrician in St. Louis, Missouri. During this period, in 1911, he suffered a severe head injury in a fall which resulted in his being in a coma for two weeks.\n\nKehoe then moved back in with his father after the injury. He had been away from the family home for several years. During that time and after his mother's death his father married Frances Wilder. On September 17, 1911, Frances was severely burned when the family's stove exploded as she was attempting to light it. The fuel soaked her, with her body catching fire. Kehoe threw water from a nearby bucket on her; due to the oil-based nature of the fire, the water did nothing to put the flames out. Frances later died from her injuries with allegations being made that the stove had been tampered with.\n\nAfter his return to Michigan, in 1912 he married Nellie Price. In 1919 the couple bought a farm outside the village of Bath from Nellie's aunt for $12,000. He paid $6,000 in cash and took out a $6,000 mortgage.\n\nKehoe was regarded by his neighbors as a highly intelligent man who grew impatient and angry with those who disagreed with him. Neighbors recalled that Kehoe was always neat, dressed meticulously, and was known to change his shirt at midday or whenever it became even slightly dirty. Neighbors also recounted how Kehoe was cruel to his farm animals, having once beaten a horse to death. The Kehoes initially attended services at the Catholic church in Bath, but he refused to pay the church's parish assessment of members and prevented his wife from attending.\n\nKehoe's neighbors thought he preferred mechanical tinkering to farming. His neighbor M. J. \"Monty\" Ellsworth wrote in his account of the disaster,\n\nWith a reputation for thrift, Kehoe was elected treasurer of the Bath Consolidated School board in 1924. While on the board, Kehoe fought for lower taxes and was often at cross purposes with other board members, voting against them and calling for adjournment when he did not get his way. He repeatedly accused superintendent Emory Huyck of financial mismanagement.\n\nWhile on the school board, Kehoe was appointed as the Bath Township Clerk in 1925 for a short period. In the spring 1926 election, he was defeated for the position, and was angered by his public defeat. His neighbor Ellsworth thought Kehoe started planning his \"murderous revenge\" against the community at that time. Another neighbor, A. McMullen, noticed that Kehoe stopped working altogether on his farm in his last year, and thought he might be planning suicide.\n\nDuring these years, Nellie Kehoe was chronically ill with tuberculosis, and had frequent hospital stays - at the time there was no effective treatment or cure for the disease. By the time of the Bath School disaster, Kehoe had ceased making mortgage and homeowner's insurance payments. The mortgage lender had begun foreclosure proceedings against the farm.\n\nThe Bath School disaster is the name given to a series of explosions perpetrated by Kehoe on May 18, 1927, in Bath Township, Michigan, which killed 45 people (including Kehoe himself) and injured at least 58. Most of the victims were children in the second to sixth grades (7–12 years of age) attending the Bath Consolidated School. Their deaths constitute the deadliest act of mass murder in a school in U.S. history.\n\nBetween May 16, when he returned home from a hospital stay, and the morning of May 18, Kehoe killed his wife. He moved her body to a farm building before setting off incendiary explosions in their house and farm buildings. About the same time, he had arranged timed explosions in the new school building. The materials in the north wing exploded as planned, killing many students and some adults inside. Kehoe had set a timed detonator to ignite dynamite and hundreds of pounds of pyrotol at the school, which he had secretly bought and planted in the basement of both wings over the course of many months. The second of explosives in the south wing did not detonate, so that part of the school was not destroyed.\n\nAs rescuers started gathering at the school, Kehoe drove up and stopped his truck. During a struggle with Superintendent Huyck, Kehoe detonated dynamite stored inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself and Huyck, as well as killing and injuring several others (among them a boy who had survived the initial bombing). During the rescue efforts, searchers discovered the additional of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol planted throughout the basement of the school's south wing. These explosives, connected to an alarm clock that was supposed to act as the detonator, had been set for the same time as the other explosion.\nAfter the bombings, investigators found a wooden sign wired to the farm's fence with Kehoe's last message, \"Criminals are made, not born\", stenciled on it. When investigators were done taking an inventory of the Kehoes' estate, they estimated that, prior to its destruction, sale of the unused equipment and materials on the farm would have yielded enough money to pay off the Kehoes' mortgage.\n\nOne of Kehoe's sisters claimed his remains and arranged for burial without ceremony in an unmarked grave at Mount Rest Cemetery in St. Johns, Michigan. The Price family claimed Nellie's remains and had her body buried in Lansing, under her maiden name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24917627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24917627", "title": "Anthony Sowell", "text": "Anthony Sowell\n\nAnthony Edward Sowell (born August 19, 1959) is an American serial killer known as the Cleveland Strangler. He was arrested in October 2009 after the bodies of eleven women were discovered by police investigators at his Cleveland, Ohio, duplex at 12205 Imperial Avenue in Mount Pleasant neighborhood.\n\nAnthony Edward Sowell was raised in East Cleveland, one of seven children born to single mother Claudia \"Gertude\" Garrison. Seven other children belonging to Sowell's sister also lived in the household, having moved in after the death of their chronically ill mother. According to Sowell's niece, Garrison subjected the siblings to physical abuse while her own children watched from adjacent rooms. In one incident, Garrison forced her to strip naked in front of the other children, then whipped her with electrical cords until she bled. Sowell himself began raping his niece on an almost daily basis for two years, starting when she was eleven.\n\nAt the age of 18, Sowell entered the United States Marine Corps on January 24, 1978. He attended recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina, then was further trained as an electrician at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. On July 13, 1978, he was assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, also in North Carolina. In 1980, Sowell spent a year overseas with the 3rd Force Service Support Group, then returned to Cherry Point. He was then ordered to Marine Corps Base Camp Butler in Okinawa, Japan on January 20, 1984. A year later, he transferred to Camp Pendleton in California for three days until his discharge on January 18, 1985. During his seven-year Marine Corps career, Corporal Sowell received a Good Conduct Medal with one service star, a Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, a Certificate of Commendation, a Meritorious Mast, and two Letters of Appreciation.\n\nIn 1989, Melvette Sockwell, who was three months pregnant, went to Sowell's home voluntarily. When she tried to leave, he bound her hands and feet with a tie and belt, then gagged her with a rag. The victim told police: \"He choked me real hard because my body started tingling. I thought I was going to die.\" Sowell was charged with kidnapping, rape and attempted rape. He eventually pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted rape, and as a result he served 15 years in prison. He was released in 2005.\n\nSowell worked in a factory until 2007 when he began collecting unemployment benefits. Neighbors said he earned a living selling scrap metal. They complained to the health department of a foul smell in the neighborhood. He was a member of an online dating service, where he stated that he was a \"master\" looking for a submissive person to \"train\".\n\nLori Frazier, a niece of Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson, began a relationship with Sowell shortly after his release from prison and resided in his home. She claims to have smelled the stench of decaying bodies and that she was told the smell was coming from Sowell's stepmother. When she moved out, she claimed that the smell was from Ray's Sausage Shop, located next door to the Sowell residence. There is some confusion about when Frazier stopped living in Sowell's home. In a video interview she mentions moving out in 2007, but in a published article she is said to have been living there until 2008. Another article quotes a friend of Frazier's stating that Frazier stopped spending time at Sowell's home in 2008.\n\nIn September 2009, Sowell invited Latundra Billups to his home for a drink. On September 22, 2009, she reported to police that after a few drinks, he became angry, hit her, choked her and raped her as she passed out. On October 29, police arrived at his home with a warrant to arrest him for the alleged rape. He was not there, but he was located and arrested two days later.\n\nThe bodies of two women were buried in a shallow grave in the basement and four other women were found on the 3rd floor of the home, in crawl spaces in the house. After digging in the backyard, investigators found three more bodies and the remains of a fourth. Police also found a human skull in a bucket inside the house, which brought the body count to eleven. Most of the victims were killed by manual strangulation and others were gagged or had ligatures on their bodies when they were discovered. Sowell also had at least three more rape victims that he had actually let live. All three never reported the attacks, due to their prior drug history or other personal reasons. Many victims were led to his property with an invitation to smoke crack cocaine with him. He was a known drug user throughout his neighborhood.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Sowell was 50 years old. He had been living at that location for four years. He was held on $5 million bond. His trial was originally supposed to start on June 2, 2010 but was repeatedly delayed: first to September 7 to allow Sowell's attorneys more time to prepare, then to February 14, 2011, then to May 2 at the request of Sowell's defense attorneys who needed more time to comb through thousands of records and hours of surveillance video footage shot from the property next door to Sowell's Imperial Avenue home, where the remains of 11 women were discovered in 2009, and later to June 6 at the request of the prosecution due to scheduling conflicts. The trial eventually began on June 6, 2011.\n\nSowell was charged with eleven counts of aggravated murder and 74 counts of rape, kidnapping, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity but later changed his plea to simply \"not guilty.\" On July 22, 2011, he was convicted on all but two counts against him, including the murders of the eleven women whose bodies were found in his house in 2009. On August 10, jurors recommended the death penalty for Sowell. On August 12, Judge Dick Ambrose upheld the jury's recommendation. Since September 14, 2011, Sowell has resided on death row at Chillicothe Correctional Institution.\n\nIn November 2011, Sowell's lawyers, Jeffry F. Kelleher and Thomas Rein, filed a Notice of Appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio. Sowell's execution was set for October 29, 2012, but in March 2012, a Motion for Stay of Execution was filed; the motion was granted in April, pending final disposition of the appeal. In October 2012, Sowell's new lawyers, Jeffrey M. Gamso and Erika Cunliffe of the Cuyahoga County Public Defender's office, appealed to have his conviction and death sentence overturned on 21 points, with the main three being:\n\n\nIn September 2014, the court asked both parties to address three issues. \n\nOn April 5, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments from Sowell's appellant attorneys and the Cuyahoga County D.A. representing the State of Ohio regarding the merits of the closed pre-trial Suppression Hearing prior to Sowell's trial, and the defendant's right to a fair and public trial. The attorneys representing Sowell argued that Sowell's Sixth Amendment right was violated by closing the Suppression Hearing to the press, and that the Court should commute his Death Sentence to Life-In-Prison as a remedy to the structural error that resulted in the violation. They also argued that counsel had made errors, and \"urged the Ohio Supreme Court to send the case back to Cuyahoga County for a retrial. 'Frankly we blew it,' attorney Jeffrey Gamso told the Ohio Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe State argued that if Sowell's Sixth Amendment right was violated via the closed pre-trial Suppression Hearing it would not have affected the outcome of the trial, as the evidence was overwhelming, and that \"Sowell's attorneys were the ones who asked multiple times in his presence for the jury selection to be done privately, without cameras in the courtroom.\" The State also asserted that Sowell has never denied his guilt, and that the heinous nature of his crimes—coupled with little mitigating evidence to deny imposing the death penalty—warrants affirming the death sentence. \n\nOn December 8, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Anthony Sowell, affirming his aggravated murder convictions and death sentence. In May 2017, Sowell appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In October 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court said that it would not review Sowell's appeal. In February 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court denied a request by Sowell to reopen his appeal.\n\nOn November 5, 2009, two of the eleven victims were identified. The first to be identified was Tonia Carmichael, a 53-year-old African American woman who had disappeared more than a year earlier. Her body was found buried in his backyard. She appeared to have been strangled and was identified through the use of DNA evidence. Her mother had reported her missing in December 2008.\n\nThe second victim was identified as Telacia Fortson, a 31-year-old African American woman who had disappeared five months earlier. Although she had been missing since June, her mother did not report her missing until she heard the news coverage regarding the dead bodies discovered in Sowell's home.\n\nOn November 8, 2009, three more bodies were identified. Crystal Dozier was a 38-year-old African American woman who went missing in May 2007. Dozier, the mother of seven children, lived in the area where her body was discovered. Her family reported her missing to the Cleveland Police Department. This was not the first time she had gone missing, and the family accused the police of failing to investigate. The family took it upon themselves to post fliers and call hospitals.\n\nAmelda \"Amy\" Hunter was a 47-year-old African American woman. Hunter, a beautician and a mother of three, did not live in the area where her body was found, but she did visit frequently. A previous injury left her unable to use one of her arms. Her family did not report her missing until after police began removing bodies from Sowell's house.\n\nMichelle Mason was a 45-year-old African American woman who was last seen in October 2008. She lived in the area where her body was found. According to records, the police conducted a full investigation when her family reported her missing.\n\nRecords of missing persons going back to Sowell's June 2005 release from prison were searched and DNA testing was conducted on the bodies found at Sowell's house. Protesters holding posters of missing loved ones gathered outside his home at the time.\n\nEast Cleveland police also reopened several cold cases from the late 1980s. The murders by strangulation used a similar modus operandi and had stopped around 1989, the same time that Sowell was arrested. The FBI at the time was gathering information to see if Sowell may have been linked to unsolved cases in cities where he once lived.\n\nAfter Sowell's conviction, in December 2011, Sowell's former residence at 12205 Imperial Avenue was demolished on the order of city leaders. Sowell resides on death row at Chillicothe Correctional Institution.\n\n\"House of Horrors: The Shocking True Story of Anthony Sowell, the Cleveland Strangler\", written by Cleveland-based journalist Robert Sberna, examines Sowell's crimes and profiles the 11 women he murdered and the six women who survived his attacks. The book was released in October 2012 by Kent State University Press. \"House of Horrors\" was named 2012 True Crime \"Book of the Year\" by ForeWord Reviews.\n\n\"Nobody's Women: The Crimes and Victims of Anthony Sowell, the Cleveland Serial Killer\" was written by Michigan-based crime author Steve Miller. The book details Sowell's murders and how he selected his victims. It was released in October 2012 by Penguin Publishing.\n\nThe case was profiled on the series premiere of the Investigation Discovery show \"Killer Instinct\".\n\n\"Unseen\", a documentary film about the victims and survivors of Sowell, was produced by Laura Paglin and released in 2016. The film, which premiered at the Cleveland International Film Festival, is distributed by FilmRise.\n\nIn November 2012. Anthony Sowell released a letter through the website Serial Killers Ink. The letter was to the people of Cleveland. Sowell railed against former trial judge and newly elected Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty and addressed the issue of artwork which he had recently sent to the owner of the website.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38170800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38170800", "title": "Ayelet Shaked", "text": "Ayelet Shaked\n\nAyelet Shaked (; ; born 7 May 1976) is an Israeli politician, activist, and computer engineer. She has served as a member of the Knesset for The Jewish Home since 2013, and as Minister of Justice since 2015. Although representing a religious party, Shaked identifies as a secular politician. She is the only secular woman in her party. She began her career in the Tel Aviv high-tech industry, working as an engineer at Texas Instruments. In 2010 she established the My Israel extra-parliamentary movement with Naftali Bennett and led it until May 2012.\n\nShe is considered one of Israel's most active and influential legislators, and initiated and drafted laws including Israel's 2016 NGO law, its comprehensive law against terrorism, a version of the basic law proposal on Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, as well as a law limiting the powers of the Israeli Supreme Court. Widely viewed as a potential future Prime Minister, in the opinion of \"Haaretz\", \"she is poised to be Israel’s most successful female Israeli politician since Golda Meir\".\n\nShaked was born Ayelet Ben Shaul in Tel Aviv to a well-educated upper-middle-class Israeli family. Her paternal grandmother immigrated to Israel from Iraq as a single mother in the 1950s as part of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, carefully investing her money in property and the education of her children. Her father was an accountant and voted Likud. Shaked describes herself as 'half-Iraqi and proud of it'. Her mother, a Bible teacher, was from a center-left Ashkenazi family whose ancestors migrated to Palestine from the Russian Empire and Romania in the 1880s as part of the First Aliyah.\n\nShe grew up in the upper middle class Bavli neighbourhood of Tel Aviv. She identified her political awakening and right-wing orientation to when she was 8 years old, after watching a television debate between Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres, where she supported the right-wing views of Shamir. As a teenager, she was a main instructor in the Hebrew Scouts Movement in Israel. At high-school, she held right-wing views but was not highly political.\n\nShe served in the IDF as an infantry instructor in the Golani Brigade, serving in the 12th \"Barak\" (\"Lightning\") battalion and Sayaret Golani (the special forces unit within the Golani Brigade). It was while she was in the army, that her right-wing views were strengthened. At Tel Aviv University, she obtained a BSc in electrical engineering and computer science. She began her career in the Tel Aviv high-tech industry, working as a software engineer at Texas Instruments and later becoming manager of the company's marketing.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2008, she was office director for the office of Benjamin Netanyahu. In 2010 she established My Israel with Naftali Bennett and led it until May 2012.\n\nFrom the end of 2011, she campaigned against illegal immigration from Africa to Israel, saying that it poses a threat to the state and also involves severe economic damage. She also campaigned against Galei Tzahal saying it had a \"left leaning agenda\".\n\nIn January 2012 Shaked was elected to serve as a member of the Likud's Central Committee; however, in June 2012 she resigned and joined the Jewish Home. On 14 November 2012 she won third place in the party's primaries, and was placed in the fifth spot on the Jewish Home list for the 2013 elections. With the list winning 12 seats, Shaked became the only secular Jewish Home MK. She subsequently joined the Economic Affairs Committee, the House Committee, and the Committee on Foreign Workers, and served as an alternate member on the Finance Committee. She also chaired the Knesset committee for the Enforcement of the Security Service Law and the National-Civilian Service Law and the Special Committee for the Equal Sharing of the Burden Bill.\n\nIn June 2014, Shaked posted an article by the late Israeli writer Uri Elitzur on Facebook. The Facebook post was variously described in the media as calling Palestinian children \"little snakes\" and appearing to justify mass punishment of Palestinians. Based upon the Facebook post, the then Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that Shaked's mindset was no different from Adolf Hitler's. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Erdoğan’s comments, stating \"Erdogan's anti-Semitic comments profaned the memory of the Holocaust.\" The leader of Israeli leftist Meretz party, Zehava Gal-On, suggested that \"because of the presidential election Erdoğan has lost control.\" Shaked stated that her post was portrayed falsely in the media, especially in that the article was presented as her own words rather than Elitzur's. She said, \"I refer specifically to 'Daily Beast' writer Gideon Resnick, who so misrepresented the facts in one of my recent Facebook posts, one has to wonder if his hatred for my country hasn’t rendered him outright useless to his website and his readers.\"\n\nIn 2015, Shaked won the primary election for the Jewish Home Party, which was considered an achievement as a secular female politician within a religious party.\n\nShaked was placed third on the Jewish Home list for the 2015 elections, and was re-elected to the Knesset. On 6 May 2015, it was reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to appoint Shaked as Minister of Justice as part of a plan to form a new coalition government. Shaked took office as Justice Minister on 14 May 2015.\n\nIn July 2015, Shaked announced that she was forming a committee to create a stable legal structure for the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The formation of the committee was agreed upon in the coalition agreement between Bayit Yehudi and Likud. She has stated: \"There are many areas in Judea and Samaria, whose legal status has not been organized. Its time to remove the legal ambiguity, and allow the residents of Judea and Samaria, many of whom live in settlements that were built by the Israeli government, to live without the persistent fear of challenges to their property ownership\". The legal status of the West Bank is disputed; the Palestinians, the UN, human rights organisations and most of the international community consider it to be occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nIn January 2016, Shaked sponsored a bill in the Knesset that would require non-governmental organizations (\"NGOs\") that receive a majority of their funding from \"foreign government entities\" to be so labeled. In an interview in \"The Washington Post\" she stated that the law would foster transparency by giving the public the right \"to know which NGOs are receiving most of their support from foreign governments and therefore representing foreign government interests.\"\n\nIn June 2016 the Israeli Knesset passed a comprehensive law against terrorism, forbidding any kind of terrorism and support of terrorism, and setting severe punishments for terrorists. The law also regulates legal efforts against terrorism and counter-terrorism measures. The law was sponsored and promoted by Justice minister Shaked.\n\nReferencing the Knesset's basic law that Israel will be a Jewish and democratic state, Shaked opposes the view that the two values are in any way incompatible, arguing that \"alongside the view that there is a constant struggle and a clash of civilizations between “Jewish” and “democratic,” I believe we can propose another model.\"\n\nShaked argues that the key of concepts of property rights, the rejection of the divine right of kings, the importance of the separation of powers, and civil liberty are a byproduct of the Jewish philosophical tradition. She states: \"On what did Locke base the right to property if not the chapters on creation? After all, Locke’s\nSecond Treatise of Government is inspired by a close textual reading of The Book of Genesis.\" She concludes that, it was \"not primarily Roman law or the democratic tradition of the Athenian polis that shaped and forged the modern democratic tradition in Europe or the United States, but Jewish tradition—joined, of course, by other traditions.\"\n\nShe proposes that \"it is precisely when we wish to promote advanced processes of democratization in Israel that we must deepen its Jewish identity. These identities clearly do not contradict each other; on the contrary, I believe that they strengthen each other.\"\n\nIn a controversial 2017 speech to the Israel Bar Association, Shaked stated that the Israeli judicial branch operates as if in a \"dream,\" adopting a \"utopian and universal worldview... Only a moral and political revolution of the magnitude of the revolution we saw in the 90s, but one reaffirming the accomplishments of Zionism and its unchanging positions, may turn this problematic tide.\" She argued that the , of which she is an advocate and architect, will lead to a \"moral and political revolution in Israel... It's a call to rouse from this dream. It's an overall perception bringing back the principles of our founding fathers to the forefront of law. It moves Zionism and the deepest and most basic components of our identity from the blind spot it currently occupies in the judicial realm to its rightful place: under the spotlight.\" Shaked states that \"Individual rights are almost sacred to me, but not devoid of context, not when cut off from our Israeli uniqueness, our national missions, our history, and our Zionist challenges.\".\n\nShaked seeks to limit the power of the Israeli judiciary. She argues that role of the judiciary needs to be delineated and restricted. \"Is it still correct to say of the judiciary in Israel what Alexander Hamilton said about the court that he knew, that it “has no influence over either the sword or the purse”? Is it really true that the judiciary in Israel has “no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society”? To my mind, this is very doubtful. In fact, it is inconceivable to me that a judicial body that bears no responsibility for filling the purse permits itself to empty it, but unfortunately, this is the situation in Israel today ... The new tracks that I seek to lay—carefully, while protecting the independence and dignity of the court—are meant to define more precisely the routes of each of the branches, legislative, executive, and judicial, and thus to enable regular traffic and prevent future collisions.\"\n\nShe writes, referencing the arguments of Alexis de Tocqueville, that the long-term damage of normalizing judicial intervention has to be distinguished from the justness of any particular legal decision. \"[O]nly a person with real patience who knows that the advantage of democratic government lies not in its immunity from errors, but in the fact that its errors can be corrected in the long term ... only a person like this could understand the enormous benefits of long-term governance power and what de Tocqueville meant when he spoke of the healthy influence of the government’s ability to govern effectively. Tocqueville’s words must be borne in mind as we lay the new tracks regulating the relations between the Supreme Court and the other branches of government. The healthy influence of governance emerges in ways that are not obvious, and certainly not in a brief focused glance, which misses the aggregate damages caused when the court repeatedly strikes down the products of the government and the Knesset.\"\n\nShaked concludes that the judicial system must \"give enough power and leeway to elected officials while minimizing the harm to the individual and giving maximum consideration to the individual’s freedom to shape his life as he wishes\".\n\nSometimes nicknamed the \"Iron Lady\" because of her intransigence in repressing crimes committed by Palestinians as well as for her nationalist positions, she supports the death penalty for individuals who have committed terrorist acts, including for Jewish who allegedly killed Palestinian children. However, she considers that the death penalty should only apply in the most extreme cases.\n\nShaked argues that the Israeli economy is insufficiently capitalistic. As part of a 20 page treatise she wrote in an academic law journal in 2016 on the structure of the Israeli legal system, she argues that the Israeli economy is suffering from massive over-regulation, and that the fight to de-regulate the economy is a constant uphill battle. \n\nShaked opposes the imposition of limits on executive pay. She argues that limiting executive pay means that \"banks and pension funds... are having trouble finding talented managers interested in being company officers. Good senior managers are looking for new directions, and are seeking to join other sectors to which the law does not apply, they are having trouble finding talented managers interested in being company officers. Good senior managers are looking for new directions, and are seeking to join other sectors to which the law does not apply... I'm asking you to refrain from enacting legislation where it is not needed. Unnecessary legislation is harmful legislation.

In an unusual intervention in foreign policy, Shaked called for an independent Kurdistan. Shaked says as the Sykes-Picot Agreement breaks apart, \"the greatest opportunity that stands before us could come from strengthening the connections with the Kurdish nation.\" Shaked says, “the Jewish and Kurdish nations share a history... of mutual respect, mutual interests,” including fighting Islamic State. Shaked has additionally cited the high number of women serving in Kurdish armed forces.\n\nShaked supports and has legislated for the decriminalization of cannabis consumption. In 2017, as Minister of Justice, Shaked submitted legislation to decriminalize the recreational use of cannabis. On successfully passing the legislation, Shaked said \"Whether one supports use of cannabis or is opposed, it is wrong to judge cannabis users per criminal law and its derivatives.\"\n\nShaked is married and has two children and lives in Bavli, Tel Aviv. Her husband is a fighter-pilot in the Israeli Air Force. She is an admirer of Steve Jobs. She was influenced by Ayn Rand, in particular \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\". She describes her personality as 'intellectual' and 'systematic'.\n\n\n"}

She was a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in the November 8, 2016 primary election for the seat being vacated by two-term Republican Senator David Vitter.\n\nFayard previously ran for lieutenant governor in the 2010 election. In the runoff election on November 2, 2010, Fayard lost to Jay Dardenne with 43% of the vote (540,649 votes) after only a three and a half month campaign.\n\nHer father is Calvin Cifford Fayard, Jr. Fayard's mother is the former Cynthia Felder, who is divorced from Fayard's father. Mrs. Fayard resides in Springfield, Louisiana. The family is eponymous of Fayard Hall on the campus of Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond. On November 2, 2010, Fayard lost the election to Jay Dardenne, who in January 2016 became the Commissioner of Administration under Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards.\n\nFayard grew up in Denham Springs. She was the valedictorian of the Class of 1996 in nearby Episcopal High School in Baton Rouge. She participated in Navy Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. She received a baccalaureate degree from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire in 2000 and a juris doctor from the University of Michigan Law School at Ann Arbor in 2005. She is licensed to practice law in Louisiana and New York State. She served as a congressional page and interned in the White House under President Bill Clinton and then worked for Goldman Sachs and Williams & Connolly before returning to Louisiana as a law clerk for Stanwood R. Duval Jr., a judge for the Federal Eastern District of Louisiana. She has served on the law faculty of Loyola University New Orleans and as of 2010 is in private practice. She has been actively involved in Louisiana Appleseed, Federal Bar Association, Junior League of New Orleans, and Delta Delta Delta.\n\nIn a September 2010 interview with Action News 17's Ken Benitez, Fayard claimed to have begun in politics with the elements of the Democratic Party associated with Senators J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., and John Breaux and United States Representative Billy Tauzin, a Democrat-turned-Republican.\n\nIn 2015, Fayard worked alongside her brother Trey Fayard to launch Glo Airlines, a regional airline based at Louis Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans (MSY) with daily flights to Shreveport, Little Rock, Memphis and Destin, FL. Fayard currently serves as legal counsel for the airline. Glo Airlines has created 40 new jobs.\n\nFayard is Roman Catholic. She is a member of Saint Thomas Catholic Church in Springfield, Louisiana. In New Orleans, she attends Most Holy Name of Jesus Church adjacent to the campus of Loyola University.\n\nOn October 2, in a field of eight candidates, Fayard (24 percent) ran ahead of Republican Sammy Kershaw (19 percent) for second place behind Dardenne (28 percent). Dardenne and Fayard then met in the November 2 general election. Fayard received 43% of the vote (540,000 votes) in the November 2nd runoff. With such a strong showing in her first statewide race, she was considered a rising star among Democratic politicians. Kershaw and Saint Tammany Parish president Kevin Davis (an eliminated Republican candidate who drew 8 percent of the vote) endorsed fellow Republican Dardenne while Fayard gained the endorsement of eliminated candidate and fellow Democratic State Senator Butch Gautreaux (4 percent).\n\nFayard's party on the evening of October 2 was attended by a number of Republicans intent on seeing the young and previously unknown Democrat.\n\nIn the showdown against Dardenne, the Republican sought to associate Fayard with President Obama, same-sex marriage, and opposition to the death penalty. Fayard countered that Dardenne represented \"the same old crowd\" of Louisiana politicians.\n\nDardenne and Fayard appeared on the October 15 \"Louisiana: The State We're In\" magazine televised by Louisiana Public Broadcasting and on an October 22 forum sponsored by the Baton Rouge League of Women Voters.\n\nOn October 4, Southeastern Louisiana University political scientist Michael Kurt Corbello commented on Fayard's achieving 24 percent as a first-time candidate in a field of eight aspirants: \n\nDespite being outspent by the Louisiana Democratic Party while the Republican Party remained financially uncommitted, Dardenne won the 2010 November 2 election and was sworn into office on November 22. The chief deputy secretary of state. Tom Schedler, succeeded Dardenne as secretary of state and still holds the position.\n\nOn 2010 October 22, Fayard's name surfaced on talk-radio program \"Think Tank with Garland Robinette\", as a potential competitor for then Governor Bobby Jindal in his presumed 2011 reelection campaign. The discussants cited Jindal's high approval ratings and already in-the-bank $7 million campaign fund as unapproachable assets for Democrats other than Fayard. The speculation continued after the election, with Fayard remaining uncommitted. Despite some initial suggestions that she might run for Louisiana Secretary of State in 2011, she ultimately declined to run.\n\nUltimately, she decided not to run for office. Fayard subsequently focussed on building a successful law practice helping Louisianans recover from the devastating effects of the BP oil spill. She also helped launch Glo Airlines with her brother, Trey Fayard.\n\nCaroline Fayard was inducted into the New Leaders Council. She has been an outspoken advocate for youth and young adults to get active in politics.\n\nFayard has remained active in local organizations in southeastern Louisiana.\n\nFayard first announced her candidacy in early February 2016, becoming the first Democrat to enter the race. Fayard faced a handful of Republican candidates, including State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy, and U.S. Representative Charles Boustany of Lafayette. U.S. Representative John C. Fleming of Minden, former KKK leader and State Representative David Duke, and retired Air Force Colonel Rob Maness also competed. Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, a Democrat and former State Senator, ran as well. Due to Louisiana's unusual Nonpartisan blanket primary, Fayard ran on the same ballot with the other 23 candidates on November 8.\n\nFayard built her campaign on her outsider status in Louisiana politics, her personal accomplishments in the legal and business world, and her advocacy for pay equity for women, Paid family leave, and expansion of charter schools. According to Fayard, voters are looking past party identification in 2016 and are seeking new leadership, arguing that \"people don't believe that government, regardless of who's in charge, is adequately serving their needs\". Her main criticism of her opponents, aside from fundamental policy concerns, was based on their status as career politicians. On the campaign trail Fayard noted the amount of time they have held public office, a political liability in a \"change\" election.\n\nAs evidence for her effectiveness as a legislator should she be elected, Fayard touted her role in the settlement negotiations following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Fayard has compared the process of negotiating settlements in plaintiff's cases to policymaking in the U.S. Government, saying that \"In reaching the settlement, you never get 100 percent of everything that what you want, but often a good compromise is almost always better than a bad win.\" She has also made the case that her experience in the private sector, including her role in GLO Airlines, has given her an appreciation for the need to find common ground and cut deals with people with whom she disagrees.\n\nPay equity for women, paid family leave, and education reform are counted among the issues Fayard most prominently addressed in her campaign. She publicly pledged to keep only 65% of her salary, equal to the gender pay gap in Louisiana, while donating the rest to charities that support women and children; this is meant to show solidarity and raise awareness for the issue of pay equity. Fayard also garnered much of her support based on her advocacy for charter schools, which was named a prominent reason behind New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's endorsement of her bid for the U.S. Senate.\n\nHer campaign style and apparatus has been compared to that of former U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu. Fayard's campaign staff included several former aides to Senator Landrieu, and Senator Landrieu herself sits on the advisory board of Democrats for Education Reform, which has endorsed Fayard's candidacy.\n\nOn September 12, Fayard was endorsed by New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. Citing her commitment to New Orleans and the state, Landrieu said of Fayard \"She will bring new energy to Washington. Caroline will keep flood protection and coastal restoration a top priority. She also understands that investments in public safety and infrastructure will make our city and state stronger. Lastly, I am confident she will also support public charter schools, which is vital to keeping our city and state moving forward.\" Fayard also received the support of many other prominent figures in Louisiana, including veteran Democratic strategist James Carville, the Alliance for Good Government, Democrats for Education Reform- Louisiana.\n\nIndependent polling from the race, conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove, indicated that Fayard was tied for 2nd place among all voters. The poll, conducted between August 29 and September 1, found Fayard at 13%, tied with U.S. Representative Charles Boustany. Leading the pack was Louisiana State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy at 18%. Fayard significantly outpaced her Democratic opponent, Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, who was at 7%. All other candidates received below 7%. As of September 25, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregator for the election has Fayard tied with Foster Campbell for 2nd place at roughly 17% of the vote each; both are 11 points behind State Treasurer John Kennedy, who is at 28%. Fayard's position in the race increased greatly since the spring of 2016, when she began the race in 6th place.\n\nHer campaign was headquartered in New Orleans, LA.\n\nPrimary Election, October 2, 2010\nRunoff Election, November 7, 2010\n\nFayard is strongly in favor of legislation that seeks to end the Gender pay gap in the United States, and has made pay equity for women workers a centerpiece for her 2016 campaign for the United States Senate. Due to the fact that Louisiana women on average earn 65 cents on the dollar compared to men, Fayard has pledged to take only 65% of her salary if elected to the Senate as a show of solidarity with women in Louisiana. Fayard pledges to do this until the Paycheck Fairness Act is passed. Further, due to the rising costs of child care, Fayard also supports increased government subsidization of low-cost childcare for working mothers.\"In Louisiana, our female workforce is the worst paid in the nation, earning 65 cents for every dollar a man makes. Consequently, Louisiana families are losing nearly $11 billion a year in what they would otherwise be earning. This isn't about ego, it's about eating,\" Fayard says on the issue. Further, Fayard supports the passage of legislation that provides paid family leave on the federal level. Fayard believes employer-provided paid leave will ease the burden on working families, especially concerning the high cost of childcare.\n\nFayard supports charter schools as a means to increase competition, choice, and quality of schools. Louisiana currently ranks fifth to last in high-school graduation. Along with expanding sufficiently regulated charter schools, Fayard supports more ambitious educational standards while retaining local control of education. Fayard's endorsements by New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and Democrats for Education Reform-Louisiana make her a leading voice in Louisiana Democratic Politics on the issue of school choice. Fayard argues that STEM education will be necessary for Louisiana's economic future, and better primary and secondary education is necessary to fill those openings. Additionally, to accomplish this goal, she proposes increasing the abundance and availability of federal grants for students who are seeking higher education in STEM fields.\n\nFayard is in favor of substantially reforming federal student debt policy. Among the reforms she proposes, Fayard highlights \"the right to refinance student loans to allow borrowers to take advantage of market interest rates, while eliminating the $2,500 cap on student loan interest deductions\". Aside from benefiting students, Fayard believes reforms that increase purchasing power of young students will help bolster consumer spending, which will benefit the Louisiana economy. Predatory lending practices also factor into Fayard's position on higher education. She believes that further regulation of for-profit universities and their financiers is needed to reign in the power of these institutions.\n\nFayard has called on the federal government to take swift and decisive action against transnational terrorism, especially when motivated by radical Islam. Fayard has noted on multiple occasions that her witnessing the September 11 attacks was pivotal in shaping the way she views the world and inspired her to commit to public service.\n\nFayard has advocated a strong pro-Israel position during her campaign for the U.S. Senate. She has called the relationship between the United States and Israel \"a cultural and strategic partnership that is mutually essential for the safety and security of both nations.\" Fayard opposes the BDS Movement, which seeks to pressure Israel to withdraw its settlements and occupation from Palestinian territory.\n\nFayard is a supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and views its activities as crucial to combating global terrorism, preventing humanitarian crises, and ensuring global stability.\n\nFayard supports comprehensive criminal justice reform to address the problems that currently exist in the U.S. Criminal Justice System. Louisiana, having the highest incarceration rate in the United States, has a justice system in a state of disrepair according to Fayard. Fayard argues for Criminal Justice Reform on the grounds of fiscal responsibility and civil rights. Fayard's ideal criminal justice system would entail \"empower[ing] judges with flexibility to make the punishment fit the crime, while directing the proper resources to efficient and effective drug treatment, mental health, and rehabilitation programs, will put Louisiana on a better path to the future.\"\n\nFayard opposes the practice of solitary confinement for juvenile offenders, which remains legal in 10 states, including Louisiana. This puts Fayard in line with President Barack Obama, who banned the practice in federal prisons in January 2016. Moreover, Fayard believes that private prisons are detrimental to society and produce inhumane conditions for prisoners while not substantially reducing costs. As a result, she believes that private corporations should not be able to profit off of the incarceration of American citizens.\n\nDespite being in favor of overhauling the criminal justice system, Fayard has billed herself as a partner with the Law Enforcement community. Fayard supports additional funding for community policing and using federal dollars to implement programs to better train officers on effective engagement in the community to stem the tide of tensions between police and the communities they serve and restore a sense of trust and cooperation. In the aftermath of the July 17th shooting of five police officers in Baton Rouge, Fayard wrote on Facebook \"This vile, unimaginable violence must stop. Attacks on any of us are attacks on all of us, including the memories of those we've lost, and this simply cannot stand. My family and I stand shoulder to shoulder in prayer with the Baton Rouge Police Department, the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office, the people of Baton Rouge, and the entire state of Louisiana.\"\n\nFayard has called on private institutions as well as the government to increase efforts to prevent sexual assault on college campuses and domestic violence against women and children. Fayard has criticized colleges and universities over what she calls a \"disturbing failure\" to implement appropriate prevention, protection, and response mechanisms on campus. \"Educating students and staff about sexual violence, preventing sexual assaults, and providing an appropriate response when sexual assaults occur should be a concerted focus for all higher education institutions around the country.\"\n\nFayard advocates for increased federal funding for \"[s]helters, domestic violence clinics, and general women, children and infant care programs\" to help victims of domestic abuse as well. She also has said that private corporations should take responsibility and adopt internal policies designed to root out forced labor and human trafficking. \"Americans cannot call their country free in good conscience as long as this issue endures,\" Fayard writes on her website.\n"}

At Ahmadpur, they were rescued by Josiah Harlan and commissioned as mounted orderlies in his expedition to overthrow the regime in Kabul, Afghanistan. Not long afterward, near Dera Ghazi Khan, he deserted Harlan.\n\nBetween 1833 and 1838, Masson excavated over 50 Buddhist sites around Kabul and Jalalabad in south-eastern Afghanistan, amassing a large collection of small objects and many coins, principally from the site at Bagram (the ancient Alexandria on the Caucasus), north of Kabul.

{"id": "18948474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18948474", "title": "Drafter", "text": "Drafter\n\nA drafter, draughtsman (British English) or draftsman, drafting technician (American English and Canadian English) is a person who makes detailed technical drawings or plans for machinery, buildings, electronics, infrastructure, sections, etc. Drafters use computer software and manual sketches to convert the designs, plans, and layouts of engineers and architects into a set of technical drawings. Drafters operate as the supporting developers and sketch engineering designs and drawings from preliminary design concepts.\n\nIn the past, drafters sat at drawing boards and used pencils, pens, compasses, protractors, triangles, and other drafting devices to prepare a drawing by hand. From the 1980s through 1990s, board drawings were going out of style as the newly developed computer-aided design (CAD) system was released and was able to produce technical drawings at a faster pace. \n\nMany modern drafters now use computer software such as AutoCAD, Revit, and SolidWorks to flesh out the designs of engineers or architects into technical drawings and blueprints but board drafting still remains the base of the CAD system. Many of these drawings are utilized to create structures, tools or machines. In addition, the drawings also include design specifications like dimensions, materials and procedures. Consequently, drafters may also be casually referred to as CAD operators, engineering draftspersons, or engineering technicians. \n\nWith CAD systems, drafters can create and store drawings electronically so that they can be viewed, printed, or programmed directly into automated manufacturing systems. CAD systems also permit drafters to quickly prepare variations of a design. Although drafters use CAD extensively, it is only a tool. Drafters still need knowledge of traditional drafting techniques, in addition to CAD skills. Despite the near global use of CAD systems, manual drafting and sketching are used in certain applications.\n\nDrafters' drawings provide visual guidelines and show how to construct a product or structure. Drawings include technical details and specify dimensions, materials, and procedures. Drafters fill in technical details using drawings, rough sketches, specifications, and calculations made by engineers, surveyors, architects, or scientists. For example, drafters use their knowledge of standardized building techniques to draw in the details of a structure. Some use their understanding of engineering and manufacturing theory and standards to draw the parts of a machine; they determine design elements, such as the numbers and kinds of fasteners needed to assemble the machine. Drafters use technical handbooks, tables, calculators, and computers to complete their work.\n\nDrafting work has many specialities such as:\n\n\nDrafters work in architectural offices, manufacturing companies, engineering firms, CAD-specific work-groups, construction companies, engineering consultancy firms, the government, natural resource companies or are independently self-employed. Drafting technologists and technicians often work as part of a broader multidisciplinary engineering team in support of engineers, architects or industrial designers or they may work on their own. The position of a drafter is one of a skilled assistant to architects and engineers. Drafters usually work in offices, seated at adjustable drawing boards or drafting tables when doing manual drawings, although modern drafters work at computer terminals much of the time. They usually work in an office environment, but some may have to travel and spend time on manufacturing plants or construction sites. As drafters spend long periods in front of computers doing detailed technical work, they may be susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems. Most drafters work standard 40-hour weeks; only a small number work part-time.\n\nHigh school courses in English, mathematics, science, electronics, computer technology, drafting and design, visual arts, and computer graphics are useful for people considering a drafting career. Attributes required by drafters include technical writing skills, problem-solving skills, the ability to visualize three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional drawings as well as drawing the relationships between parts in machinery and various pieces of infrastructure. Other skills include an in-depth knowledge of the qualities of metals, plastics, wood and other materials used in the overall manufacturing processes and of construction methods and standards. Technical expertise, a strong understanding of construction and the manufacturing process, and a solid knowledge of drafting and design principles are also important assets in becoming a drafter. In the modern job marketplace, in addition to technical skills enabling CAD drafters to draw up plans, soft skills are also crucial as CADD drafter have to communicate with clients and articulating their drawing plans in an effective way with fellow team members in a real-world setting.\n\nEmployers prefer applicants who have also completed training after high school at a trade or technical school. Prospective drafters will also need to have a strong background knowledge and experience with CADD software. Though licenses aren’t a prerequisite for becoming drafters, the American Design Drafting Association (ADDA) does offer certification and licensing. Licensing and certification highlights one's core competence and knowledge of a specific drafting specialty.Drafting and design certificates and diplomas are generally offered by career training schools, trade and technical schools and non-university higher education institutions like community colleges or industrial training institutes. \n\nApprenticeships combine paid on-the-job training and experience with in-class instruction. People interested in becoming drafters can get qualified as either drafting technologists or drafting technicians. Drafting technologists usually have a 2 to 3-year diploma in engineering design or drafting technology from a community college or technical school. Drafters starting out tend to move from company to company to gain experience and to move up. A more senior drafter often moves up into a management position where they become able to supervise entire projects as they gain more experience or they can start their own business and become self-employed. It is also possible for experienced drafters to enter related fields such as engineering, architecture, industrial design, interior design, exhibit design, landscape design, set design, and animation.\n\n"}

Julius Caesar was born on July 13, 100 BC, into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus. His father died when he was just 16, leaving Caesar as the head of the household. His family status put him at odds with the Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who almost had him executed. \n\nAt about that time, Caesar found himself captured by pirates, only to crucify his former captors after he was ransomed. Soon he began his military career. He served in Hispania, married Sulla's granddaughter and was elected chief priest, all in rapid succession. \n\nShortly after this, he was suspected, though not convicted, of involvement in the Catiline Conspiracy. Soon he was leaving for a governorship in Hispania and positioning himself to be one of the most important figures in history.\n\nCaesar was born into an aristocratic family, the \"gens Julia\", which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus. The \"cognomen\" \"Caesar\" originated, according to Pliny the Elder, with an ancestor who was born by caesarean section (from the Latin verb to cut, \"caedere\", \"caes-\"). The \"Historia Augusta\" suggests three alternative explanations: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin \"caesaries\"); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin \"oculis caesiis\"); or that he killed an elephant (\"caesai\" in Moorish) in battle. Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favoured this interpretation of his name. \n\nDespite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, having produced only three consuls. Caesar's father, also called Gaius Julius Caesar, reached the rank of praetor, the second highest of the Republic's elected magistracies, and governed the province of Asia, perhaps through the influence of his prominent brother-in-law Gaius Marius. \n\nHis mother, Aurelia Cotta, came from an influential family which had produced several consuls. Marcus Antonius Gnipho, an orator and grammarian of Gaulish origin, was employed as Caesar's tutor. Caesar had two older sisters, known as Julia Major and Julia Minor. Little else is recorded of Caesar's childhood. Suetonius and Plutarch's biographies of him both begin abruptly in Caesar's teens; the opening paragraphs of both appear to be lost.\n\nCaesar's formative years were a time of turmoil, and \"savage bloodshed\". The Social War was fought from 91 to 88 BC between Rome and her Italian allies over the issue of Roman citizenship, while Mithridates of Pontus threatened Rome's eastern provinces. Domestically, Roman politics was divided between politicians known as \"optimates\" and \"populares\". The \"optimates\" tended to be more conservative, defended the interests of the upper class and used and promoted the authority of the Senate; the \"populares\" advocated reform in the interests of the masses and used and promoted the authority of the Popular Assemblies. These were not official political parties, but were instead loose confederations of like-minded individuals who would often switch sides. Caesar's uncle Gaius Marius was a \"popularis\", Marius' protégé Lucius Cornelius Sulla was an \"optimas\", and in Caesar's youth their rivalry led to civil war.\n\nBoth Marius and Sulla distinguished themselves in the Social War, and both wanted command of the war against Mithridates, which was initially given to Sulla; but when Sulla left the city to take command of his army, a tribune passed a law transferring the appointment to Marius. Sulla responded by marching his army on Rome (the first time ever this happened and an influence for Caesar in his later career as he contemplated crossing the Rubicon), reclaiming his command and forcing Marius into exile, but when he left on campaign Marius returned at the head of a makeshift army. He and his ally Lucius Cornelius Cinna seized the city and declared Sulla a public enemy, and Marius's troops took violent revenge on Sulla's supporters. Marius died early in 86 BC, but his followers remained in power.\n\nIn 85 BC Caesar's father died suddenly while putting on his shoes one morning, without any apparent cause, and at sixteen, Caesar was the head of the family. The following year he was nominated to be the new \"Flamen Dialis\", high priest of Jupiter, as Merula, the previous incumbent, had died in Marius's purges. Since the holder of that position not only had to be a patrician but also be married to a patrician, he broke off his engagement to Cossutia, a plebeian girl of wealthy equestrian family he had been betrothed to since boyhood, and married Cinna's daughter Cornelia.\n\nThen, having brought Mithridates to terms, Sulla returned to finish the civil war against Marius' followers. After a campaign throughout Italy he seized Rome at the Battle of the Colline Gate in November 82 BC and had himself appointed to the revived office of dictator; but whereas a dictator was traditionally appointed for six months at a time, Sulla's appointment had no term limit. Statues of Marius were destroyed and Marius' body was exhumed and thrown in the Tiber. Cinna was already dead, killed by his own soldiers in a mutiny. \n\nSulla's proscriptions saw hundreds of his political enemies killed or exiled. Caesar, as the nephew of Marius and son-in-law of Cinna, was targeted. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding. The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the Vestal Virgins. Sulla gave in reluctantly, and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar.\n\nFeeling it much safer to be far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, Caesar quit Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the siege of Mytilene. On a mission to Bithynia to secure the assistance of King Nicomedes' fleet, he spent so long at his court that rumours of an affair with the king Nicomedes arose. The loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career: the \"Flamen Dialis\" was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.\n\nIn 79 BC, Sulla resigned his dictatorship, re-established consular government and, after serving as consul in 80 BC, retired to private life. In a manner that the historian Suetonius thought arrogant, Julius Caesar would later mock Sulla for resigning the Dictatorship—\"Sulla did not know his political ABC's\". He died later in 78 BC and was accorded a state funeral. \n\nHearing of Sulla's death, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. Lacking means since his inheritance was confiscated, he acquired a modest house in the Subura, a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome. His return coincided with an attempted anti-Sullan coup by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus but Caesar, lacking confidence in Lepidus's leadership, did not participate. \n\nInstead he turned to legal advocacy. He became known for his exceptional oratory, accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for extortion and corruption. Even Cicero praised him: \"Come now, what orator would you rank above him...?\" Aiming at rhetorical perfection, Caesar travelled to Rhodes in 75 BC to study under Apollonius Molon, who had previously taught Cicero.\n\nOn the way across the Aegean Sea, Caesar was kidnapped by Cilician pirates and held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of Pharmacusa. He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. While held captive for a period of thirty-eight days he would participate in his captors' games, exercise alongside them, and order them to be silent when they were loud. During this time, Caesar also wrote poems and practiced his public speaking. He read his prose out loud to the pirates, flatly calling them illiterate barbarians if his work wasn't appreciated. The pirates were greatly entertained by his arrogance, which they attributed to the young man's age. When the pirates thought to demand a ransom of twenty talents of gold, he insisted they ask for fifty. After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them in Pergamon. Marcus Junctus, the governor of Asia, refused to execute them as Caesar demanded, preferring to sell them as slaves, but Caesar returned to the coast and had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivity—a promise the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut. He then proceeded to Rhodes, but was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of auxiliaries to repel an incursion from Pontus.\n\nOn his return to Rome he was elected military tribune, a first step on the \"cursus honorum\" of Roman politics. The war against Spartacus took place around this time (73–71 BC), but it is not recorded what role, if any, Caesar played in it. He was elected quaestor for 69 BC, and during that year he delivered the funeral oration for his aunt Julia, widow of Marius, and included images of Marius, unseen since the days of Sulla, in the funeral procession. His own wife Cornelia also died that year. \n\nAfter her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC, Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Hispania under Antistius Vetus. While there he is said to have encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. He requested, and was granted, an early discharge from his duties, and returned to Roman politics. On his return in 67 BC, he married Pompeia, a granddaughter of Sulla. \n\nHe was curator of the Appian Way in 66 BC and after taking out massive loans began a reconstruction project of the ancient road. This was a gamble as it placed him in early debt but allowed voters traveling to the city to see the work he had done. He was elected aedile and restored the trophies of Marius's victories; a controversial move given the Sullan regime was still in place. He also brought prosecutions against men who had benefited from Sulla's proscriptions, and spent a great deal of borrowed money on public works and games, outshining his colleague Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. He was also suspected of involvement in two abortive coup attempts.\n\nIn 63 a tribune, Titus Labienus, prosecuted the elderly optimate senator Gaius Rabirius for the killing, 37 years previously, of the populist tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, who had been declared a public enemy by the Senate after a candidate for the consulship had been murdered during an election. Caesar was one of the two judges, and Suetonius says he had bribed Labienus to bring the prosecution. The charge was the archaic offence of \"perduellio\", a form of treason, the punishment for which was crucifixion. Rabirius was defended by Quintus Hortensius, who argued that he had not killed Saturninus, and Cicero, who argued that the killing of Saturninus was lawful as it had been done under the \"senatus consultum ultimum\", a declaration of a state of emergency which authorised the consuls to do whatever it took to protect the Republic. Rabirius was convicted, and exercised his right of appeal to the people. During his appeal, a procedural technicality was contrived - the praetor Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer took down the military flag from the Janiculum hill, indicating foreign invasion - and proceedings were adjourned. The prosecution was never resumed. The purpose of the trial is obscure, but it has been interpreted as a challenge to the use of the \"senatus consultum ultimum\". Cassius Dio characterises it as a populist attack on the authority of the Senate. Labienus would remain an important ally of Caesar over the next decade, and served under him during the Gallic wars.\n\nThe same year, Caesar ran for election to the post of Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the Roman state religion, after the death of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, who had been appointed to the post by Sulla. He ran against two powerful \"optimates\", the former consuls Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus. There were accusations of bribery by all sides. Caesar is said to have told his mother on the morning of the election that he would return as Pontifex Maximus or not at all, expecting to be forced into exile by the enormous debts he had run up to fund his campaign. He won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing, possibly because the two older men split their votes. The post came with an official residence on the Via Sacra.\n\nWhen Cicero, who was consul that year, exposed Catiline's conspiracy to seize control of the republic, Catulus and others accused Caesar of involvement in the plot. Caesar, who had been elected praetor for the following year, took part in the debate in the Senate on how to deal with the conspirators. During the debate, Caesar was passed a note. Marcus Porcius Cato, who would become his most implacable political opponent, accused him of corresponding with the conspirators, and demanded that the message be read aloud. Caesar passed him the note, which, embarrassingly, turned out to be a love letter from Cato's half-sister Servilia.\n\nCaesar argued persuasively against the death penalty for the conspirators, proposing life imprisonment instead, but a speech by Cato proved decisive, and the conspirators were executed. The following year a commission was set up to investigate the conspiracy, and Caesar was again accused of complicity. On Cicero's evidence that he had reported what he knew of the plot voluntarily, however, he was cleared, and one of his accusers, and also one of the commissioners, were sent to prison.\n\nWhile praetor in 62 BC, Caesar supported Metellus Nepos, now tribune, in proposing controversial legislation that would recall Pompey and his army in order to quell the rising disorder in Italy. However, the pair were so obstinate in their proposals that they were suspended from office by the Senate. Caesar attempted to continue to perform his duties, only giving way when violence was threatened. The Senate was persuaded to reinstate him after he quelled public demonstrations in his favour.\n\nThat year the festival of the Bona Dea (\"good goddess\") was held at the \"domus publicus\", Caesar's residence as pontifex maximus. No men were permitted to attend, but a young patrician named Publius Clodius Pulcher managed to gain admittance disguised as a woman, apparently for the purpose of seducing Caesar's wife Pompeia. He was caught and prosecuted for sacrilege. Caesar gave no evidence against Clodius at his trial, careful not to offend one of the most powerful patrician families of Rome, and Clodius was acquitted after rampant bribery and intimidation. Nevertheless, Caesar divorced Pompeia, saying that \"the wife of Caesar must be above suspicion.\"\n\nAfter his praetorship, Caesar was appointed to govern Hispania Ulterior (Outer Iberia), but he was still in considerable debt and needed to satisfy his creditors before he could leave. He turned to Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of Rome's richest men. In return for political support in his opposition to the interests of Pompey, Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Hispania he conquered the Callaici and Lusitani, being hailed as \"imperator\" by his troops, reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.\n\nBy the time Caesar returned to Rome mid-year in 60 BC, the senate had granted him the title of \"imperator\", a title which entitled him to a triumph. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand \"in absentia\", but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.\n\n\n"}

His two main collections were of Japanese stamps (later acquired by Philipp von Ferrary) and of postal stationery (later in the ownership of Thomas Tapling).\n\nHe joined the Philatelic Society, London in 1880, in which he served in all the principal positions. He was elected President in 1917.\n\nHe was known to help some British collectors to manage their philatelic possessions. The first one was Thomas Keay Tapling; when Tapling bequeathed his collection to the British Museum, Bacon mounted the ensemble and wrote its description, a task he undertook for an exhibition in February 1897, after Tapling's death in 1891. After that, he managed Henry J. Duveen's collection, and published in 1911 the catalogue of the Crawford Library. In 1907 Bacon was the first President of the Philatelic Literature Society. Bacon was also a member of the Fiscal Philatelic Society.\n\nA week after John Alexander Tilleard, \"Philatelist to the King\", died in September 1913, Bacon was invited by King George V to be the Curator of the Royal Philatelic Collection. He accepted and travelled from his residence in Croydon to Buckingham Palace two or three times a week until his death to work on the collection, to buy stamps, to receive items from the post offices in the United Kingdom, and the British Dominions and colonies, and to mount all this in uniform red stamp albums, while Tilleard had accumulated and mounted only when the King was preparing an exhibition at the Royal Philatelic Society London. Nevertheless, John Wilson, Keeper of the Collection after Bacon's death, criticised the way Bacon added new hinges without removing old ones.\n\nWhereas deafness isolated Bacon from the others members of the Royal Court, he alone succeeded in balancing the collection's budget when the King bought a lot and to mount every project, essay and issued stamp received. During World War I, the session in the Stamp Room placed inside Buckingham Palace diverted the King from matters of state and the war, and made him consider the curator as a friend like Tilleard.\n\nAfter George V's death in January 1936, Bacon continued his tasks on a collection that became part of the royal heritage. Even if Kings Edward VIII and George VI were less enthusiastic stamp collectors than their father, they made sure that all British and colonial postal authorities continued to send philatelic material to the Curator. But Edward VIII ordered that the collection had to be financially self-sufficient, through the sales of duplicate stamps. In July 1936 Bacon was authorised to sell two 500-dollar stamps of the Straits Settlements featuring King Edward VII for 1,000 pounds.\n\nIn April 1938 Bacon announced to the King his retirement on the next first of September. John Wilson was quickly chosen because, as President of the Royal Philatelic Society London and chairman of its Expert Committee, he already knew the collection well. However, Bacon died of influenza in June 1938. From 1904 until his death, he lived in Croydon, commuting to work at Buckingham Palace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5trF1m2m6s\n\nIn 1917 Bacon was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, then Commander in 1922 and Knight in 1932.\n\nIn 1906 he received the first Lindenberg Medal from the Berliner Philatelisten-Klub and was amongst the first to sign the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists with King George V.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1204652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1204652", "title": "Edward VIII postage stamps", "text": "Edward VIII postage stamps\n\nThe Edward VIII postage stamps are a definitive stamp series issued in the United Kingdom during the 20 January – 11 December 1936 reign of King Edward VIII.\n\nThe profile portrait chosen was taken by Hugh Cecil's studio. The design was suggested by H.J. Brown, an 18-year-old man, and sent in February 1936 to the postal authorities. It inspired Harrison and Sons printers. The only graphic decorations on the stamp were the crown, the denomination in the upper corners, and the word \"POSTAGE\" at the bottom. Brown's project, the simplest of all submissions, placed the words \"POSTAGE\" and \"REVENUE\" on the lateral sides. The Post Office wrote to Mr Brown telling him that his proposed design could not be used. After the stamp came out, clearly using Brown's design, Brown's father issued a statement regretting the Post Office's deceit.\n\nWatermarked with a crown and \"E8R\", the d green, the d brown and the d blue stamps were issued on 1 September 1936, and the one penny red on 14 September. After Edward's abdication there was the usual delay in designing and distributing the stamps of George VI. Thus the Edward VIII stamps remained on sale for months. That, and the large numbers saved by the public, have kept their collector value very low.\n\nThe four or part of the four stamps were overprinted to be used in the British post offices in Morocco. For Tangier, the name of the town was overprinted alone. \"MOROCCO / AGENCIES\" was overprinted with a new face value in French centimes or Spanish céntimos depending the zone of the post office.\n\nAs soon as the beginning of the reign in January 1936, the British Post Office was preparing two other issues in addition to this \"accession issue\" of four definitive stamps: work was done at the Post Office and at Harrison & Sons were done for a \"Coronation issue\", previewed for the 12 May 1937, and a final \"Definitive issue\". Essays for the former were made with the King wearing different military uniforms, such as the Bertram Park's pictures of Edward VIII wearing Seaforth Highlander and Welsh Guard uniforms. In March 1936, the King accepted the idea of larger stamps picturing his effigy and castles. But the abdication stopped all design efforts (despite essays having been made).\n\nThe 2d red stamp project of Australia used a photograph of the King in uniform. The sole ornaments were the denomination in an oval in the bottom right corner and the red \"POSTAGE\" bar at the bottom. Printing of this stamp began in September 1936 at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's printing branch. All operations were stopped with the abdication.\n\nDespite the destruction of the stock and all material needed for the printing, a 6 × 2d red stamp signed corner block is in the hands of a British collector. On 29 September 1936, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, Governor of Victoria, visited the plant and was invited to sign and date one of the finished sheets. In the name of the Commonwealth Bank, printer John Ash offered the sheet to the Governor in October, but had to claim it back on 16 December. The sheet was given back the next day, but the six stamp corner block bearing the signature was missing. The Governor had already sent it to someone in England and could not retrieve it.\n\nIn Canada, the Edward VIII stamp dies and proofs were officially destroyed on 25 and 27 January 1937; some essays were kept in the archives, and the two plaster casts were saved by coin engraver Emmanuel Hahn and a postal officer.\n\nIn March 1936, the Canadian Post Office received the photographic profile the new King wanted to be used, and in June it obtained the one received by the Royal Mint. The Canadian Banknote Company worked on traditional ornemented designs with the two pictures with the help of the American Banknote Company, New York. In October, the Post Office received a plaster cast by British artist Hugh Paget. Finally, on 1 December 1936, the project was accepted by Lord Tweedsmuir, the Governor-in-Council. Two die-proofs were sent to London for the King to approve, but arrived after the abdication and were brought back to Canada.\n\nThe prepared design was used with a Bertram Park portrait of King George VI; this permitted an issue on 1 April 1937.\n\nFor the Falkland Islands, George Roberts redrew photographs of the archipelago's fauna, human activities and coat of arms. These illustrations were inscribed inside a rectangular frame bearing two upper corner circles: the right side one for a crown and the left one for the profile of the King, from the same picture as the British issued series.\n\nAfter the abdication, the projects were reworked by Roberts. Edward VIII's profile in a circle was replaced by a picture of King George VI in an oval, with his military collar still visible. The stamp series was issued on 3 January 1938.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "644050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=644050", "title": "Fisher King", "text": "Fisher King\n\nIn Arthurian legend, the Fisher King, also known as the Wounded King or Maimed King, is the last in a long line charged with keeping the Holy Grail. Versions of the original story vary widely, but he is always wounded in the legs or groin and incapable of standing. All he is able to do is fish in a small boat on the river near his castle, Corbenic, and wait for some noble who might be able to heal him by asking a certain question. In later versions knights travel from many lands to try to heal the Fisher King, but only the chosen can accomplish the feat. This is Percival alone in the earlier stories; in later versions, he is joined by Galahad and Bors. \n\nMany later works have two wounded \"Grail Kings\" who live in the same castle, a father and son (or grandfather and grandson). The more seriously wounded father stays in the castle, sustained by the Grail alone, while the more active son can meet with guests and go fishing. For the purposes of clarity in the remainder of this article, where both appear, the father will be called the Wounded King, the son named the Fisher King. \n\nIn the Fisher King legends, it is implied that he becomes unable to father or support a next generation to carry on after his death (a \"thigh\" wound has been interpreted by many scholars in Arthurian literature as a genital wound). There are slight hints in the early versions that his kingdom and lands suffers as he does, and 20th-century scholars have suggested his impotence affecting the fertility of the land and reducing it to a barren wasteland.\n\nThe Fisher King appears first in Chrétien de Troyes' \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\" in the late 12th century, but the character's roots may lie in Celtic mythology. He may be derived more or less directly from the figure of Brân the Blessed in the \"Mabinogion\". In the Second Branch, Bran has a cauldron that can resurrect the dead (albeit imperfectly; those thus revived cannot speak) which he gives to the king of Ireland as a wedding gift for him and Bran's sister Branwen. Later, Bran wages war on the Irish and is wounded in the foot or leg, and the cauldron is destroyed. He asks his followers to sever his head and take it back to Britain, and his head continues talking and keeps them company on their trip. The group lands on the island of Gwales, where they spend 80 years in a castle of joy and abundance, but finally they leave and bury Bran's head in London. This story has analogues in two other important Welsh texts: the Mabinogion tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\", in which King Arthur's men must travel to Ireland to retrieve a magical cauldron, and the poem \"The Spoils of Annwn\", which speaks of a similar mystical cauldron sought by Arthur in the otherworldly land of Annwn.\n\nThe Welsh Romance \"Peredur son of Efrawg\" is based on Chrétien or derived from a common original, but it contains several prominent deviations and lacks a Grail. The character of the Fisher King appears (though he is not called such) and presents Peredur with a severed head on a platter. Peredur later learns that he was related to that king, and that the severed head was that of his cousin, whose death he must avenge by defeating the Nine Witches.\n\nThe Fisher King is a character in Chrétien's \"Perceval\" (1180) which is the first of a series of stories and texts on the subject of Perceval and the Grail. He represents the Pope, or papal authority, which has been compromised by wealth, an aristocratic lifestyle and dependency for support in his office upon those who live by the code of chivalry. Accordingly, he is unable to protect families, women, cultivated land, the built infrastructure and trade from the violence of knights who live by that code and which is characterised as waste. His impotence in the face of chivalry and its endemic evils is represented by the wound in his thighs which has crippled him and confines his activities to fishing with a hook. Later versions of the story, e.g. the Didot \"Perceval\", reject this critique and point to papal succession as the source of papal authority.\n\n\"Parzival\" was written in 1210 by Wolfram von Eschenbach, forty years after \"Perceval\". Although a different work, it is strikingly similar to \"Perceval\". The story revolves around the Grail Quest and once again the main character is Percival or Parzival. Similarly to \"Perceval\", Eschenbach kept the story line of Parzival not asking the healing question, which results in him Questing for years. Eschenbach's \"Parzival\" differs from Chrétien's \"Perceval\" in three major ways. Firstly, the Fisher King is no longer nameless and is called Anfortas. Secondly Eschenbach thoroughly describes the nature of the wound. The wound is a punishment for wooing a woman who is not meant for him (every Grail keeper is to marry the woman the Grail determines for him), causing the King immense pain. Then lastly Parzival comes back to cure the Fisher King. \"Parzival\", unlike its predecessor \"Perceval\", has a definite ending.\n\nThe Fisher King's next development occurred around the end of the 13th century in Robert de Boron's \"Joseph d'Arimathie\", the first work to connect the Grail with Jesus. Here, the \"Rich Fisher\" is called Bron, a name similar enough to Bran to suggest a relationship, and he is said to be the brother-in-law of Joseph of Arimathea, who had used the Grail to catch Christ's blood before laying him in the tomb. Joseph founds a religious community that travels eventually to Britain and entrusts the Grail to Bron (who is called the \"Rich Fisher\" because he catches a fish eaten at the Grail table). Bron founds the line of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.\n\nThe Lancelot-Grail cycle includes a more elaborate history for the Fisher King. Many in his line are wounded for their failings, and the only two that survive to Arthur's day are the Wounded King, named Pellehan (Pellam of Listeneise in Malory), and the Fisher King, Pelles. \n\nPelles engineers the birth of Galahad by tricking Lancelot into bed with his daughter Elaine, and it is prophesied that Galahad will achieve the Grail and heal the Wasteland. Galahad, the knight prophesied to achieve the Holy Grail and heal the Maimed King, is conceived when Elaine gets Dame Brisen to use magic to trick Lancelot into thinking that he is coming to visit Guenever. So Lancelot sleeps with Elaine, thinking her Guenever, but flees when he realizes what he has done. Galahad is raised by his aunt in a convent, and when he is eighteen, comes to King Arthur's court and begins the Grail Quest. Only he, Percival, and Bors are virtuous enough to achieve the Grail and restore Pelles.\n\nIn the Post-Vulgate and Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", the Fisher King's wound was given to him by Sir Balin in the \"Dolorous Stroke\", when Balin grabs a spear and stabs Pellam in self-defense. The spear is the Spear of Longinus, however, and Pellam and his land must suffer for its misuse until the coming of Galahad. The Dolorous Stroke is typically represented as divine vengeance for a sin on the part its recipient. The nature of Pellam's sin is not stated explicitly, though he at least tolerates his murderous brother Garlon, who slays knights while under cover of invisibility, apparently at random. \n\nKing Pelles is the Maimed King is one of a line of Grail keepers established by Joseph of Arimathea, the father of Eliazer and Elaine (the mother of Galahad), and he resides in the castle of Corbinec in Listenois. Pelles and his relative Pellehan appear in both the Vulgate (Lancelot-Grail) and Post-Vulgate Cycles, as well as in later works, such as Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" (in which Pellehan is called Pellam). In the Vulgate, Pelles is the son of Pellehan, but the Post-Vulgate is less clear about their relationship. It is even murkier in Malory's work: one passage explicitly identifies them (book XIII, chapter 5), though this is contradicted elsewhere. \n\nIn all, there are characters (some of whom can probably be identified with each other) filling the role of Fisher King or Wounded King in Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\":\n\n\nIn addition, there is the figure of King Pellinore, who is Percival's father (in other versions of the legend, Percival is related to the Pelles family). It would appear that Malory intended to have one Maimed King, wounded by Balin and suffering until healed by his grandson Galahad, but never managed to successfully reconcile his sources.\n\nThe injury is a common theme throughout the telling of the Grail Quest. Although some iterations have two kings present, one or both are injured, most commonly in the thigh. The wound is sometimes presented as a punishment, usually for philandering. In \"Parzival\", specifically, the king is injured by the bleeding lance as punishment for taking a wife, which was against the code of the \"Grail Guardians\". In some early story lines, Percival asking the Fisher King the healing question cures the wound. The nature of the question differs between \"Perceval\" and \"Parzival\", but the central theme is that the Fisher King can be healed only if Percival asks \"the question\".\n\nThe location of the wound is of great importance to the legend. In most medieval stories, the mention of a wound in the groin or more commonly the \"thigh\" (such as the wounding of the ineffective suitor in Lanval from the \"Lais of Marie de France\") is a euphemism for the physical loss of or grave injury to one's penis. In medieval times, acknowledging the actual type of wound was considered to rob a man of his dignity, thus the use of the substitute terms \"groin\" or \"thigh\", although any informed medieval listener or reader would have known exactly the real nature of the wound. Such a wound was considered worse than actual death because it signaled the end of a man's ability to function in his primary purpose: to propagate his line. In the instance of the Fisher King, the wound negates his ability to honor his sacred charge.\n\nThroughout Arthurian legend, homoerotic narratives have been found, and there are some strong arguments that they are present in the story of the Fisher King. The Fisher King's wound can be interpreted as effeminate or in fact a \"castration\". The wound could be a feminizing aspect, especially coupled with the Fisher King's inability to hunt. The treatment for this wound is also repeated contact by male servants (Roberts, 54). Furthermore, in some versions of the story, the only way to alleviate the Fisher King's pain is reinsertion of the spear that causes the wound. In later iterations, Galahad became the focus of the Grail Quest. In Malory's work specifically, the Fisher King is healed by Galahad, who pours the blood from the lance onto the king to heal his wounds. The nature of the wound is still the same, located between the thighs.\n\nMost of the Grail romances do not differ very much from \"Parzival\" and \"Perceval\". That being said, there are two interesting exceptions to this case. The two pieces that hold particularly stronger Christian themed deviations than prior works are \"Queste del Saint Graal\" and \"Sone de Nausay\". \"Queste del Saint Graal\" is heavily Christianized not only in terms of the tone but also the characters and significant objects. The Grail maidens become angels, there is a constant relationship between the knights and religious symbolism; most importantly, the Fisher King is replicated as a priest-like figure In the case of \"Sone de Nausay\" by Robert de Boron, Bron (the Fisher King) is part of a tale in which the story makes a constant correlation between the Gospel narrative and the history of the Grail.\n\nThe bleeding lance has taken numerous forms throughout the Arthurian literature chronology. In the earlier appearances of the lance, it is not represented as a Christian symbol, but morphs into one over time. In \"Perceval\" and \"Parzival\", the lance is described as having \"barbaric properties\" which are difficult to associate with Christian influence. Chretien describes his lance with \"marvelous destructive powers\", which holds a closer connection to the malignant weapons of the Celtic origin. In Chretien's \"Perceval\", the lance takes on a dark and almost evil persona and also seems to overshadow the Grail, which if this was a Christian story would be rather odd. Wolfram's tale also treated the lance in a similar dark manner. In \"Parzival\", the lance is \"poisonous\" which contrasts sharply with the general trend of healing Christian themes. This lance is plunged into the Fisher King's wound at different times to continue his pain, for having sought forbidden love. This lance is considered significant because it is most often associated directly with the wound of the Fisher King, which is demonstrated both in Chretien's and Eschenbach's versions of the tale.\n\nThe more recent writings have the lance presented in the Fisher King's castle with Christian theology. More specifically, it is supposed to be the lance that pierced Jesus Christ while on the cross. This is seen in Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\". In Malory's version the Fisher King is healed with the blood from the lance, signifying it as a good, holy, Christian object. In \"Corbenic\" we see the precession at the Fisher King's feast, featuring heavily on the Holy Grail, which is a strong Christian artifact. It can be extrapolated that in the same precession, the accompanying lance is the lance that pierced Jesus Christ.\n\nThe sword is commonly thought to be a gift from the Fisher King to Perceval. This is then followed by Perceval's cousin's prophecy that the sword will break at a crucial moment. In two cases, the writers tell us that Perceval broke the sword: in Eschenbach, it fails him in his battle against his half-brother at the end of \"Parzival\"; and Gerbert de Montreuil describes how he shatters it on the gates of the \"Earthly Paradise\". The adventure of the broken sword is a theme originally introduced by Chretien, who intended it as a symbol of Perceval's imperfections as a knight. The major example for his imperfection is that Perceval refused to ask about the Grail. This concept of punishment is also seen in Eschenbach's tale where Perceval is told: \"your uncle gave you a sword, too, by which you have been granted since your eloquent mouth unfortunately voiced no question there.\" The sword remains as a plot device to both remind Perceval of how he failed to ask the healing question and as a physical reminder of the existence of \"Munsalvaesche\" (Eschenbach's name for Corbenic).\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "158628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158628", "title": "George Albert Wells", "text": "George Albert Wells\n\nGeorge Albert Wells (22 May 1926–23 January 2017), usually known as G. A. Wells, was a Professor of German at Birkbeck, University of London. After writing books about famous European intellectuals, such as Johann Gottfried Herder and Franz Grillparzer, he turned to the study of the historicity of Jesus, starting with his book \"The Jesus of the Early Christians\" in 1971. He is best known as an advocate of the thesis that Jesus is essentially a mythical rather than a historical figure, a theory that was pioneered by German biblical scholars such as Bruno Bauer and Arthur Drews.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Wells said that the hypothetical Q document, which is proposed as a source used in some of the gospels, may \"contain a core of reminiscences\" of an itinerant Galilean miracle-worker/Cynic-sage type preacher. This new stance has been interpreted as Wells changing his position to accept the existence of a historical Jesus. In 2003 Wells stated that he disagreed with Robert M. Price on the information about Jesus being \"all mythical\". Wells believes that the Jesus of the gospels is obtained by attributing the supernatural traits of the Pauline epistles to the human preacher of Q.\n\nWells was Chairman of the Rationalist Press Association. He was married and lived in St. Albans, near London. He studied at the University of London and Bern, and holds degrees in German, philosophy, and natural science. He taught German at London University from 1949, and was Professor of German at Birkbeck College from 1968.\n\nWells's fundamental observation is to suggest that the earliest extant Christian documents from the first century, most notably the New Testament epistles by Paul and some other writers, show no familiarity with the gospel figure of Jesus as a preacher and miracle-worker who lived and died in the recent decades. Rather, the early Christian epistles present him \"as a basically supernatural personage only obscurely on Earth as a man at some unspecified period in the past\". Wells believed that the Jesus of these earliest Christians was not based on a historical character, but a pure myth, derived from mystical speculations based on the Jewish Wisdom figure.\n\nIn his early trilogy (1971, 1975, 1982), Wells argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of a Jewish Wisdom figure—the Jesus of the early epistles—who lived in some past, unspecified time period. And also on the views of New Testament scholars who acknowledge that the gospels are sources written decades after Jesus's death by people who had no personal knowledge of him. In addition, Wells wrote, the texts are exclusively Christian and theologically motivated, and therefore a rational person should believe the gospels only if they are independently confirmed. Wells clarified his position in \"The Jesus Legend\", that \"Paul sincerely believed that the evidence (not restricted to the Wisdom literature) pointed to a historical Jesus who had lived well before his own day; and I leave open the question as to whether such a person had in fact existed and lived the obscure life that Paul supposed of him. (There is no means of deciding this issue.)\"\n\nIn his later trilogy from the mid-1990s, \"The Jesus Legend\" (1996), \"The Jesus Myth\" (1999), and Can We Trust the New Testament? (2004). Wells modified and expanded his initial thesis to include a historical Galilean preacher from the Q source:\"I propose here that the disparity between the early [New Testament] documents and the [later] gospels is explicable if the Jesus of the former is not the same person as the Jesus of the latter. Some elements in the ministry of the gospel Jesus are arguably traceable to the activity of a Galilean preacher of the early first century, who figures in what is known as Q (an abbreviation for \"Quelle\", German for ‘source’). Q supplied the gospels of Matthew and Luke with much of their material concerning Jesus’s Galilean preaching. [...] In my first books on Jesus, I argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of the Jesus of the early epistles. The summary of the argument of the \"Jesus Legend\" (1996) and the \"Jesus Myth\" (1999) given in this section of the present work makes it clear that I no longer maintain this position. The weakness of my earlier position was pressed upon me by J.D.G. Dunn, who objected that we really cannot plausibly assume that such a complex of traditions as we have in the gospels and their sources could have developed within such a short time from the early epistles without a historical basis (Dunn, [\"The Evidence for Jesus\"] 1985, p. 29). My present standpoint is: this complex is not all post-Pauline [there is also a historical Galilean preacher from the Q source] (Q, or at any rate parts of it, may well be as early as ca. A.D. 50); and if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical. The essential point, as I see it, is that the Q material, whether or not it suffices as evidence of Jesus's historicity, refers to a [human] personage who is not to be identified with the [mythical] dying and rising Christ of the early epistles.\" (\"Can We Trust the NT?\", 2004, pp. 43, 49–50).\n\nWells later allowed for the possibility that the central figure of the gospel stories may be based on a historical character from first-century Galilee: \"[T]he Galilean and the Cynic elements ... may contain a core of reminiscences of an itinerant Cynic-type Galilean preacher (who, however, is certainly not to be identified with the Jesus of the earliest Christian documents).\" Sayings and memories of this preacher may have been preserved in the \"Q\" document that is hypothesized as the source of many \"sayings\" of Jesus found in both gospels of Matthew and Luke. However, Wells concluded that the reconstruction of this historical figure from the extant literature would be a hopeless task.What we have in the gospels is surely a fusion of two originally quite independent streams of tradition, ...the Galilean preacher of the early first century who had met with rejection, and the supernatural personage of the early epistles, [the Jesus of Paul] who sojourned briefly on Earth and then, rejected, returned to heaven—have been condensed into one. The [human] preacher has been given a [mythical] salvific death and resurrection, and these have been set not in an unspecified past (as in the early epistles) but in a historical context consonant with the Galilean preaching. The fusion of the two figures will have been facilitated by the fact that both owe quite a lot of their substance in the documents—to ideas very important in the Jewish Wisdom literature. (\"Cutting Jesus Down to Size\", 2009, p. 16)\n\nThe updated position taken by Wells was interpreted by other scholars as an \"about-face\", abandoning his initial thesis in favor of accepting the existence of a historical Jesus. However, Wells insisted that this figure of late first-century gospel stories is distinct from the sacrificial Christ myth of Paul's epistles and other early Christian documents, and that these two figures have different sources before being fused in Mark, writing, \"if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical.\" Wells notes that he belongs in the category of those who argue that Jesus did exist, but that reports about Jesus are so unreliable that we can know little or nothing about him. Wells argues, for example, that the story of the execution of Jesus under Pilate is not an historical account, writing, \"I regarded (and still do regard) [the following stories;] the virgin birth, much in the Galilean ministry, the crucifixion around A.D. 30 under Pilate, and the resurrection—as legendary\". Many scholars still note Wells as a mythicist.\n\nCo-author R. Joseph Hoffmann has called Wells \"the most articulate contemporary defender of the non-historicity thesis.\" Wells' claim of a mythical Jesus has received support from Earl Doherty, Robert M. Price and others. The classical historian R. E. Witt, reviewing \"The Jesus of the Early Christians\" in the \"Journal of Hellenic Studies\", offered some criticisms but concluded that \"Hellenists should welcome the appearance of this challenging book.\"\n\nHowever, Wells' conclusions have been criticized by biblical scholars and ecclesiastical historians such as W. H. C. Frend and Robert E. Van Voorst. Voorst further critiques Wells work as \"[Wells] advanced the non-historicity hypothesis, not for objective reasons, but for highly tendentious, anti-religious purposes.\" Historian David Aikman from Patrick Henry College criticizes Wells' lack of expertise and objectivity: \"Wells is not a New Testament specialist at all but a professor of German and a former chairman of the Rationalist Press Association. He has written several books rejecting the historicity of Jesus, a position almost no New Testament scholar endorses, even those who are radically opposed to Christianity.\" Wells featured in the controversial Channel 4 television series about the historicity of Jesus, \"Jesus: The Evidence\" (LWT: 1984).\n\nAfter reviewing criticisms from several authors, atheist philosopher Michael Martin said that although \"Wells's thesis is controversial and not widely accepted,\" his \"argument against the historicity of Jesus is sound\".\n\nBart Ehrman, in his \"Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)\" (2012) stated: \"The best-known mythicist of modern times — at least among the NT scholars who know of any mythicists at all — is George A. Wells...He has written many books and articles advocating a mythicist position, none more incisive than his 1975 book, \"Did Jesus Exist?\". Wells is certainly one who does the hard legwork to make his case: Although an outsider to NT studies, he speaks the lingo of the field and has read deeply in its scholarship. Although most NT scholars will not (or do not) consider his work either convincing or particularly well argued.\" (p. 19). Wells provided an answer to these points in an article in \"Free Inquiry\".\n\nHis major works in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German language thought and letters are\n\n\n\n\n"}

Elliott was an eyewitness to events which she detailed in her memoirs, \"Journal of my life during the French Revolution\" (\"Ma vie sous La Révolution\") published posthumously in 1859. She was the mistress of the Duke of Orléans, and the future George IV, by whom she is said to have borne an illegitimate daughter. Elliott trafficked correspondence and hid French aristocrats escaping from the French Revolution. She was arrested several times but managed to avoid the guillotine, and was released after the death of Robespierre.\n\nElliott was born probably in Edinburgh about 1754, the youngest daughter of Grisel Craw (\"d\". \"c\".1765) and Hew Dalrymple (d.1774), an Edinburgh advocate concerned in the great Douglas case. Her parents separated around the time of her birth, and she was most likely brought up at her grandparents house.\n\nShe was educated in a French convent, and on her return to Scotland, was introduced by her father into Edinburgh society. Her beauty made such an impression on John Elliott, a prominent and wealthy physician, that he made her an offer of marriage in 1771. She accepted, although Elliott was some 20 years her senior. They were married on 19 October 1771 in London. The couple entered fashionable society, but eventually grew apart due to their difference in age and interests. In 1774 Elliott met and fell in love with Lord Valentia, with whom she entered into an affair. Convinced of his wife's infidelity, John Elliott had the couple followed and eventually sued Valentia for criminal conversation (adultery). He received £12,000 in damages before successfully obtaining a divorce.\n\nWith her social reputation destroyed, Elliott became recognised as a member of the demimonde and forced to earn her living as a professional mistress or courtesan. She was then taken by her brother to a French convent, but she seems to have been brought back almost immediately by Lord Cholmondeley, who became her lover and remained one of her principal protectors throughout her life.\n\nHaving met Lord Cholmondeley at the Pantheon in 1776, she began a liaison with him that lasted for three years. Thomas Gainsborough painted a portrait of her in 1778, which is in the Frick Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1782, she had a short, concealed intrigue with the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) and gave birth to a daughter on 30 March 1782, who was baptised at St Marylebone as Georgiana Augusta Frederica Seymour (d. 1813) but used the name Georgina Seymour.\n\nElliott declared that the Prince was the father of her child and \"The Morning Post\" stated in January 1782 that he admitted responsibility. However, the child was dark in complexion, and when she was first shown to the Prince, he is said to have remarked, \"To convince me that this is my girl they must first prove that black is white.\"\n\nThe Prince and many others regarded Lord Cholmondeley as the father of the girl, although the Prince's friends said that Charles William Wyndham (brother of Lord Egremont), whom she was thought to resemble, claimed paternity. Yet others thought she might have been fathered by George Selwyn. Lord Cholmondeley brought up the girl, and after her early death in 1813, looked after her only child.\n\nGeorge, Prince of Wales, introduced her to the French Duke of Orleans in 1784 and by 1786, she had permanently set up residence in Paris and become one of Orleans' recognised mistresses. In exchange for her companionship, the Duke granted her a home on the Rue Miromesnil and a property in Meudon, to the south of Paris. During this period Elliott also pursued liaisons with the Duke de Fitz-James and the Prince of Conde.\n\nMuch of what is known about Elliot's life in France is recorded in her memoirs, \"Journal of my life during the French Revolution.\" Although there are a number of inconsistencies in her account, her work has become one of the best-known English-language accounts of The Terror, documenting the movements of the Duke of Orleans and those within his aristocratic Jacobin circle at the Palais-Royal. During her life in Paris, Elliott witnessed the horror of the September Massacres and the body of the Princess de Lamballe carried through the streets. Although Elliott was an associate of the Duke of Orleans (who later took the name Philippe Égalité) her royalist sympathies soon became widely known throughout her district, and her home was frequently searched during the programme of domiciliary visits. It has been recently shown that Elliott was trafficking correspondence on behalf of the British government and assisting in the transportation of messages between Paris and members of the exiled French court in Coblenz and in Belgium.\n\nOn several occasions, Elliott risked her life to assist and hide aristocrats who were being pursued by the Revolutionary government. Shortly after the Assault on the Tuileries Palace, on 10 August 1792, Elliott hid the injured Marquis de Champcentz by physically carrying him to her house on the Rue Miromesnil, at great risk. During a search of her home, she placed him between the mattresses of her bed and feigned illness. On another occasion, Elliott agreed to take in and hide Madame de Perigord and her two children at her home in Meudon, who were attempting to flee to England. Elliott was instrumental in arranging false travel documents for those wishing to escape the Revolution and after hiding Champcentz in the attic of her home in Meudon, she was able to orchestrate his passage out of France. In the spring of 1793 Elliott was arrested and imprisoned and spent the rest of the Terror incarcerated at several prisons, including the Recollets and the Carmes, where she claims to have met Joséphine de Beauharnais, though this assertion has been questioned by historians. Elliott details her harrowing experiences in prison, the violent coercion she experienced, as well as the illness and deprivation endured by her fellow prisoners.\n\nAlthough many of her friends met their deaths, including Madame du Barry, Elliott did not. She narrowly avoided death and was released after the Reign of Terror came to an end, not before she had been confined in total to four different prisons by the republican government. In later years, there were rumours that she had an attachment with Napoleon Bonaparte, but had rejected his offer of marriage. She died a wealthy woman at Ville d'Avray, in present-day Hauts-de-Seine, in May 1823, while a lodger with the commune's mayor.\n\nShe was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nA dramatic portrayal of part of her life is contained in the 2001 film \"The Lady and the Duke\". English actress Lucy Russell played Elliott and Jean-Claude Dreyfus played the Duke of Orleans.\n\nGrace Elliott also appears as a major character in Hallie Rubenhold's novel \"The French Lesson\" (Doubleday, 2016).\n\n\n\n"}

Although Clarke was a prolific composer, he is best remembered as an associate of Arthur Sullivan, for whom he arranged music and compiled overtures for some of the Savoy Operas, including Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Mikado\".\n\nClarke began as an organist, pianist and theatre conductor, becoming a musical director for Gilbert and Sullivan, among others. While conducting at London theatres, he also composed a tremendous volume of church music, organ solos, songs, operettas and orchestral works. Beginning in the late 1870s, he composed incidental music as musical director for many of Henry Irving's spectacular productions at the Lyceum Theatre. He also composed music for many of the German Reed Entertainments and conducted at many other London theatres in the 1870s and 1880s. Clark published a \"Manual of Orchestration\" and music criticism, as well as some fiction. In 1889, he took charge of the Victorian National Orchestra in Australia, returning to England in 1892 and soon becoming conductor of the Carl Rosa Opera Company for several years.\n\nClarke was born in Birmingham, the son of an amateur organist. He began playing the piano at age four, and by six had improvised a tune that he reused in one of his mature works forty years later. He took up the violin when he was eight and played in an orchestra at twelve. In the same year, he became the organist at his church and was composing music by age 19. His parents did not approve of his taking music up as a profession, and he was sent to work first with an analytical chemist and then with a land surveyor. According to \"The Musical Times\", he did not take up music as a profession until he was in his twenties. In 1864 he was awarded the first prize for anthems by the College of Organists.\n\nClarke held posts as organist in Ireland and was conductor of the Belfast Anacreontic Society. From 1866 he was organist at Queen's College, Oxford, where he also conducted the Queen's College Musical Society. After travelling for several years, he returned to London in 1871 and became the organist of Kensington Parish Church, London, and in 1872 he succeeded Arthur Sullivan as organist of St. Peter's, South Kensington. He left that post soon, however, to become a theatrical conductor.\nClarke was Richard D'Oyly Carte's musical director and conductor at the Opera Comique in 1874 for \"The Broken Branch\" adapted from \"La Branche Cassée\". Clarke interpolated into the operetta a ballet of his own composition, \"Les Prètresses de l'Amour\". In October 1875, Sullivan hired Clarke as a replacement musical director of \"Trial by Jury\" at the Royalty Theatre, London, when Charles Morton succeeded Carte as general manager of the opera's original production. Clarke then moved with the production to the Opera Comique in January 1876, where it ran until May. In 1876 Clarke was reported to be suffering from \"a long and painful illness\", and Carte organised a benefit concert for him at the Langham Hall. By December of that year, Clarke was working again, adapting the score and providing new choruses and ballet music for the first English performances of \"Die Fledermaus\" at the Alhambra Theatre. The reviewer of \"The Observer\" found Strauss's music \"thin and commonplace\" and thought Clarke's additional music much superior: \"in remarkable contrast to that with which it is associated, being full of bright, characteristic melody, well harmonised and enriched by masterly orchestration.\" In 1877, Clarke participated in a very early experiment with telephony, with his organ playing being sent a distance of four miles down a wire.\n\nClarke performed on the piano as an accompanist at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden that year, and in 1878, encouraged by Sullivan, who was then in charge of the concerts, he conducted a major orchestral work of his own, a symphony in F major. \"The Times\" reported this concert thus:\nClarke conducted at ten or more London theatres, including the Lyceum Theatre, where he composed music for a number of Henry Irving's productions, including \"Hamlet\" and \"The Merchant of Venice\". Irving's co-star, Ellen Terry, wrote in her memoir, \"The Story of My Life\", \"No one was cleverer than Hamilton Clarke, Henry's first musical director, and a most gifted composer, at carrying out [Irving's] instructions. Hamilton Clarke often grew angry and flung out of the theatre, saying that it was quite impossible to do what Mr. Irving wanted. 'Patch it together, indeed!' he used to say to me indignantly... 'Mr. Irving knows nothing about music, or he couldn't ask me to do such a thing.' But the next day he would return with the score altered on the lines suggested by Henry, and would confess that the music was improved. 'Upon my soul, it's better! The 'Guv'nor' was perfectly right.'\" He was one of the many composers recruited to write German Reed Entertainments at St. George's Hall. These included \"Castle Botherem: or An Irish Stew\" (1880), \"Cherry Tree Farm\" (1881), and \"Nobody's Fault\" (1882) to texts by Arthur Law, and \"Fairly Puzzled\" (text by Oliver Brand) in 1884 and \"A Pretty Bequest\" (text by T. Malcolm Watson) in 1885. Reviews both for Clarke's music and the performances of Corney Grain and the rest of the company were excellent.\nClarke was a close associate of Arthur Sullivan. In 1878, at Sullivan's instance, he was engaged by Carte as musical director of his touring Comedy-Opera Company from March to November 1878, while the Company presented a revival of \"Trial\", the first provincial production of \"The Sorcerer\", and, from September 1878, the first provincial production of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\". He assisted Sullivan by arranging musical selections from \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" for the promenade concerts at Covent Garden in 1878 that stimulated audience interest in that opera. Sullivan described Clarke's arrangement as \"most spirited\" and conducted it at several of the promenade concerts in late August. Clarke also made an arrangement from \"The Pirates of Penzance\" for the promenade concerts in 1880.\n\nClarke later arranged the overtures for Gilbert and Sullivan's operas \"The Sorcerer\" (for its 1884 revival), \"The Mikado\" (1885) and \"Ruddigore\" (1887). He also assisted in the piano arrangement of Sullivan's 1886 cantata, \"The Golden Legend\" and helped prepare the score for printing. Sullivan biographer Gervase Hughes later strongly criticised Clarke's work, finding the \"Mikado\" overture carelessly constructed and his \"Ruddigore\" overture a \"jumble\" and \"a crude selection, hardly redeemed by its spirited ending\". Hughes also criticised Clarke's overture to \"The Sorcerer\", though misattributing it to Alfred Cellier. Sullivan considered rewriting the \"Mikado\" overture and was thought to have sketched out a new overture on more symphonic lines, but no trace of it survives. Clarke's \"Ruddigore\" overture was dropped by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1919 in favour of a wholly rewritten overture by Geoffrey Toye.\n\nIn 1882 Clarke provided the music for Lord Tennyson's play \"The Promise of May\", which was \"a miserable fiasco\", though Clarke's music was praised. He also contributed to the music of the successful 1885 burlesque \"Little Jack Sheppard\". In 1887, he accepted the post of musical director at the Comedy Theatre under the management of Herbert Beerbohm Tree.\n\nClarke composed over 600 musical works, of which some 400 were published. His second symphony, in G minor, premiered in 1879, and he composed the music for some half dozen ballets and at least eleven operas. Compositions by Clarke mentioned over the years in \"The Musical Times\" showed the breadth of his interests, from part-songs, to organ works, to comedy: \"Love and Gold\": Four-Part Song; \"Original Compositions for the Organ\": No. 110; \"Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in B Flat\"; \"Sonatina for the Pianoforte\"; \"God so Loved the World\"; \"To the Audience\": Humorous Four-Part Song; \"They That Go down to the Sea in Ships\"; Romance for Violin and Pianoforte; and \"To a Red Rose\".\n\nIn 1894, Clarke published \"The Daisy-Chain\" (Op. 352), an operetta for children in two acts, for which he wrote both words and music. He also wrote both the libretto and the score for \"Hornpipe Harry\", in 1897, a well-reviewed show depicting the adventures of sailors cast ashore on a remote island. One of his last compositions was the one-act operetta \"The Outpost\", first produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre in July 1900. It was produced as a curtain raiser to \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and \"Patience\" until December 1900 and also ran on tour in 1901–02.\n\nIn 1888 Clarke published his \"Manual of Orchestration\" described by \"The Musical Times\" as an excellent little book. \"As far as can be gathered, either from direct statements or implied directions, Gounod would be the model suggested for imitation, Wagner for avoidance.\" Clarke's conservatism caused comment from other reviewers; \"The Musical Standard\" mocked him for denying that Wagner was a master of orchestration: \"Mr. Clarke should re-edit his work, cutting out all this nonsense. It might then form an admirable book for the beginner\". Clarke also wrote several other books and articles about orchestration, as well as some fiction and song lyrics.\n\nIn 1889, Clarke went to Australia, where he succeeded Frederick Cowen as conductor of the Victorian National Orchestra in Melbourne. He was also made inspector of Australian army bands, and given the honorary rank of Captain. He did not enjoy Melbourne; after returning to England in 1892, he gave a talk describing his experiences, giving \"many valuable hints … to those who might think of accepting appointments in the Australian Colonies\". His comments drew a rejoinder from an Australian writer who accused him of \"incompetence and lack of interest\" while in Melbourne.\n\nClarke was appointed conductor of the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1893. In 1899 he composed and conducted the incidental music for John Martin Harvey's adaptation of \"A Tale of Two Cities\". Clarke was forced to retire around 1901 because of failing eyesight. In later life, Clarke suffered from health problems that affected his mind. According to Ellen Terry, Clarke's \"brilliant gifts... 'o'er-leaped' themselves, and he ended his days in a lunatic asylum.\"\n\nClarke died at Banstead Asylum in Surrey in 1912, aged 72.\n\n\n"}

Born April 6, 1950, he is the only child of Nathan Katz (accountant) and Rosalyn Anker (talent agent, entertainer, lapidary shop owner, and founder of Animals in Distress). He grew up in Queens, New York, but moved with his family to Merrick, N.Y. in 1962. He was a recognized child prodigy in electronic engineering, able to read and draw schematic diagrams before he could read and write English. Rather than send their only child away to a boarding school for gifted children, his parents arranged for home-schooling, which was continued until Katz' mid-teens when he began auditing college level courses at local universities.\n\nEventually Katz enrolled in undergraduate studies at Stony Brook University, part of the State University of New York. Katz rapidly advanced through mathematics, psychology, psychophysiology, physics, and biology. As a graduate student in mathematics at SUNY Stony Brook, he published a new method of factor rotation, programmed (in Fortran) a portion of the Numerical Taxonomy Systems Package, and published a number of papers in refereed journals.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Katz was invited to enroll at the University of Lancaster in England, where his academic interests and expertise coalesced in the application of mathematics and psychometrics to the study of psychophysiology and genetics via sophisticated instrumentation which he designed and built. Katz's graduate studies were interrupted by an extended critical illness during which time he returned to his family home in the U.S. In 1983, Katz received a Ph.D. from the University of Lancaster, England, under the mentorship of both Phillip Levy, Chair of Lancaster's Psychology Department, and Hans Eysenck, psychometrician and founder of the Psychology Department at the University of London. Despite the offer of a teaching and research position in Dr. Eysenck's department, after graduation Katz returned to Long Island to be close to his family.\n\nAfter graduation, Katz held several research positions. He worked for the Brain Research Laboratories (New York University) developing neurometric systems based on the multivariate statistical analysis of electroencephalographic signals (EEG). He later worked for HeartMap, a biomedical company, where he headed the design, hardware prototyping, software development and testing of a 64-channel cardiac monitor with special analytic capabilities, including neural network pattern recognition and the ability to generate 3-D images of the electrical potentials across the surface of the heart. He also worked for the American Society for Psychical Research. where he developed experimental protocols, conducted data analysis, as well as designed and built low noise instrumentation for a variety of psycho physiological and physical experiments.\n\nIn 1989, Katz founded and became CEO of Scientific Consultant Services, Inc. (www.scientific-consultants.com), a firm that provides advanced solutions to difficult data handling problems in diverse fields. To that end, he developed sophisticated artificial intelligence software (neural networks and genetic algorithms). His clients have ranged from the U.S. Navy to the Swedish Lumber Authority; major asset management firms to individual investors. His accomplishments include the development of the first commercially available neural network model that forecasts the date, direction and degree of S&P 500 and OEX turning points from one day to months in advance (NexTurn); the development of the first 32-bit neural network development tool for PCs (N-Train); and the development of the first neurogenetic development tool, designed for the genetic evolution of neural networks (LogiVolve).\n\nIn addition, Katz served as Managing Principal and Director of Trading and System Development of Blackhorn Asset Management, LLC (2005–2008); Technical Director of Interactive Software Laboratories, Inc. (1995–1998), a firm offering data, data management tools and predictive software to the financial community; and Co-Founder, Vice President, and Director of Software Development, Datatek, Inc. (1990–1993), a consulting and trading system development firm.\n\nThroughout his life, Katz has given generously of his time and resources to various nonprofit causes, ranging from animal welfare to science education. He has lectured and taught classes at all levels of academia and at private organizations, has published extensively in several fields (in refereed journals, trade magazines, anthologies) and, with his wife, co-authored three books for McGraw-Hill\n\nFrom 2003-2013, Katz devoted substantial time to one of his main passions: science education. During that period, he established research and internship programs at the Custer Institute, Inc., where he also served on the Board of Directors (2003–2013), as Observatory Director (2004–2012), and as Research Chair (2006–2012). He was the founder and coordinator of the Custer Institute's “Education Through Research” Program, and served as mentor for students from high school through graduate school, often helping them achieve grants and competitive awards. To help promote the Institute and its programs, for several years Katz wrote a monthly astronomy column for the \"Long Island Pulse\" magazine, and was featured in numerous media productions, including the PBS award-winning documentary, \"The Souls of New York.\" To facilitate the work of the Institute, he obtained grants for its research and educational programs, enlisted the participation of many local scientists and academicians, and developed specialized hardware (e.g., optics innovations) and software (e.g., a unique deconvolution algorithm for image enhancement). In acknowledgment of his accomplishments, he was awarded a Citation from the New York State Assembly. Katz is currently on the Advisory Board of Montauk Observatory, Inc.\n\nWhile at the Custer Institute, Katz's childhood interest in amateur radio resurfaced. He revitalized the Institute's amateur radio and radio astronomy programs and was pivotal in arranging the donation and installation of a 55-foot crank-up radio tower from the Great South Bay Amateur Radio Club (of which he is still a member).\n\nKatz's latest research endeavor is the development of a multi-schedule survey of symptomatology and treatment of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Nearly 5000 respondents have participated in this study, which revealed important correlations between a number of factors, including the relationship between thyroid conditions and these disorders. Katz is currently working on a publication about this study and the results.\n\n\nKatz is fluent in written and spoken Spanish, enjoys music ranging from early 20th century jazz to heavy metal, is an avid amateur astronomer, and holds an Extra Class amateur radio license (AC2BQ).\n\nKatz currently lives in Selden, New York, with his wife, Donna L. McCormick (married in 2009).\n"}
{"id": "83472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83472", "title": "Lazarus Long", "text": "Lazarus Long\n\nLazarus Long is a fictional character featured in a number of science fiction novels by Robert A. Heinlein. Born in 1912 in the third generation of a selective breeding experiment run by the Ira Howard Foundation, Lazarus (birth name Woodrow Wilson Smith) becomes unusually long-lived, living well over two thousand years with the aid of occasional rejuvenation treatments. Heinlein \"patterned\" Long on science fiction writer Edward E. Smith, mixed with Jack Williamson's fictional Giles Habibula.\n\nHis exact (natural) life span is never revealed. In his introduction at the beginning of \"Methuselah's Children\", he claims he is 213 years old. Approximately 75 years pass during the course of the novel, but because large amounts of this time are spent traveling close to the speed of light, the 75-year measurement is an expression of the time elapsed on Earth rather than time seen from his perspective. At one point, he estimates his natural life span to be around 250 years, but this figure is not expressed with certainty. He acknowledges that such a long life span should not be expected as a result of a mere three generations of selective breeding, but offers no alternative explanation except by having a character declare, \"A mutation, of course-—which simply says that we don't know\".\n\nIn \"Methuselah's Children\", Long mentions visiting Hugo Pinero, the scientist appearing in Heinlein's first published story \"Life-Line\", who had invented a machine that precisely measured lifespan. Pinero refuses to reveal the results of Lazarus's reading and returns his money.\n\nThe promotional copy on the back of \"Time Enough for Love\", the second book featuring Lazarus Long, states that Lazarus was \"so in love with time that he became his own ancestor,\" but this never happens in any of the published books. In the book, Lazarus does travel back in time and is seduced by his mother, but this takes place years after his own birth. Heinlein did, however, use just such a plot device in the short story \"—All You Zombies—\", in which a character becomes both of his own parents.\n\nA rugged individualist with a distrust of authority, Lazarus drifts from world to world, settling down periodically and leaving when the situation becomes too regimented for his taste-—often just before an angry mob arrives to capture him.\n\nThe Lazarus Long set of books involve time travel, parallel dimensions, free love, individualism, and a concept that Heinlein named World as Myth—the theory that universes are created by the act of imagining them, such that even fictional worlds are real.\n\nNovels featuring Lazarus include:\n\n\"The Notebooks of Lazarus Long\", a book containing sayings of the character Lazarus Long largely taken from \"Time Enough for Love\", was published in 1978.\n\nWhen the character of Lazarus Long is introduced in \"Methuselah's Children\", he is 213 years old, and the breeding experiment that created the Howard Families has proven to be a success, with most \"Howards\" enjoying a lifespan of approximately 150 years and changing identities periodically to conceal their long lifespans. 10% of their number have elected to end \"The Masquerade\" and live publicly, with the approval of the Howard Foundation; but this process has backfired.\n\nThe general public of Earth, once exposed to the Howards' lifespan, believes incorrectly that the Howards have discovered an anti-aging process that they are choosing to conceal, and come to resent them. Civil liberties applied to the Howards are suspended, and the entire membership of the Howard Families is detained, with the exception of Lazarus himself.\n\nWith the aid of the elected head of the world government, Slayton Ford, Lazarus hijacks the \"New Frontiers\", a starship designed to travel to distant stars, and liberates the Howards. While the \"New Frontiers\" was designed to sustain a colony in travel at speeds significantly below the speed of light, a Howard named Andrew Jackson \"Slipstick\" Libby raises the ship to speeds approaching lightspeed. With the ship thus modified, the Howard Families, under the leadership of Lazarus Long, escape the solar system in search of a planet of their own.\n\nThe first planet they encounter is populated by the Jockaira, an intelligent species that has been domesticated for another, unnamed, species whom they worship as gods. When the latter discover that the humans cannot be domesticated, all of the humans are forcibly removed from the planet and placed in their ship, which is then transferred to another star system and planet by means of technology sufficiently advanced that it is not observable by the humans.\n\nThis second planet is populated by a diminutive furry species called the \"Little People\", who are a very advanced collective intelligence. They are very accommodating to the humans, and in fact their world is pleasant enough to be considered a paradise. After many years, Mary Sperling—a close friend of Lazarus and the second-oldest of the Howard Families—joins the collective intelligence in order to escape thanatophobia; whereupon Lazarus and many other Howards return to Earth. Approximately twelve thousand remain behind.\n\nUpon return to Earth, the Howards learn that a rejuvenation treatment has been developed to approximate the secret of longevity supposedly held by themselves; thus permitting Lazarus, who is grown old, to regain his youth.\n\nAt the beginning of this book, Lazarus has grown weary of life and decides to die. He returns to Secundus, where a standing order is in place to notify the Chairman Pro Tempore of the Howard Families if he came on world. He is located and, without his consent, subjected to rejuvenation at the behest of his descendant Ira Weatheral, Chairman \"Pro Tempore\" of the Howard Families, who believes that the society and culture of Secundus are in death throes, and wishes to lead the Families to a new planet named Tertius, having had Lazarus advise him in doing so. Lazarus later agrees, promising to commit suicide if Ira does not meet his demands; and in exchange, Ira orders a search to find Lazarus a new amusement. This search, using a \"Zwicky Box\", is performed by an artificial intelligence named Minerva, who handles most of the computerized functions of the planetary government, is in love with Ira, and becomes friends with Lazarus. Meanwhile, the latter's rejuvenator named Ishtar and Ira's daughter named Hamadryad, both give birth to female clones of him, their Y-chromosome being replaced by an identical copy of the X chromosome, producing \"daughters\" named Lapis Lazuli and Lorelei Lee. Lazarus' advice to Ira appears alternately as proverbs and as stories.\n\nLazarus assists Ira in the migration to Tertius; settles the latter; and attempts a trans-temporal journey to Earth, circa 1919-1929; but mistakenly arrives in 1916, there to insinuate himself into his parents' family under the name of \"Ted Bronson\", whom his grandfather Ira (resembling \"The Old Man\" of Heinlein's earlier work \"The Puppet Masters\") suspects to be an illegitimate nephew or son of his own. Lazarus also discovers, to his surprise and (initial) shame, a sexual desire of his own mother, Maureen. When his family learns that he has no plans to join the army in World War I, they spurn him, prompting him to enlist. His genetic father, Brian Smith, also an officer, makes arrangements for him to go overseas, thinking he is doing \"Ted\" a favor.\n\nBefore deployment, Lazarus again visits his family, whereupon he learns that Maureen is as attracted to him as he is to her. She explains that her husband does not insist on fidelity, although she is careful not to become pregnant by any man but Brian; and being newly pregnant, consummates her attraction to Lazarus himself. Overseas, Lazarus is seriously wounded in combat, but is rescued by his Tertian household.\n\nIn \"The Number of the Beast\", the main characters discover a way to travel to fictional worlds, and in the course of their explorations, visit the world of Lazarus Long. Using the technology of these characters' ship (which can travel through space and time), Lazarus snatches his mother out of the time stream at the end of her life and replaces her with a dead clone.\n\nLazarus also appears as a minor character in \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\" and plays a role in Heinlein's last novel, \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\", which is the life story of Maureen. In the former novel, Lazarus is revealed at the end of the novel as the father of protagonist Colin \"Richard Ames\" Campbell; whereas in the latter novel, Maureen as narrator tells a somewhat different version of Lazarus' visit to Earth in 1916-18, details that information about the future received from Lazarus was crucial to the Howard Foundation's survival of the Great Depression, and reveals that Lazarus (as Woodrow \"Bill\" Smith) was the backup pilot of the first lunar expedition.\n"}

He enjoyed a successful career in his native Belgium and, in particular, in the Netherlands with PSV Eindhoven. However, his playing days came to an end in the 2000–01 season after breaking his leg in a match with his club Aston Villa following a clash with Ipswich Town goalkeeper Richard Wright.\n\nHis former clubs include K.F.C. Winterslag, R.S.C. Anderlecht, PSV Eindhoven and Aston Villa.\n\nHaving left Anderlecht for Eindhoven in 1994, Nilis topped the Dutch scoring charts in the 1995–96 season, plundering 21 goals. He continued that form into 1996–97 – leading the pack by December 1996 with 13 – before matching his previous total, in a season that ended with PSV winning the league title for the first time in five years. In late 1997, Nilis scored thrice in three games over a fifteen-day period, all against Shay Given; with a goal at Newcastle United in the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League group stage coming in between goals for Belgium against the Republic of Ireland. During his time with PSV, Nilis formed one of the deadliest partnerships in Europe with team-mate Ruud van Nistelrooy, who signed for PSV in 1998. In the 1998–99 season, Nilis and van Nistelrooy scored 55 league goals between them. Van Nistelrooy finished as top-scorer, Nilis came second. In the following season, Nilis' last for PSV, they scored 48 league goals between them.\n\nThen, after 6 years in the Netherlands, Nillis joined Aston Villa on a Bosman transfer in July 2000. Nilis' Villa career started well, as he scored on his debut in the UEFA Intertoto Cup against Dukla Příbram on 22 July 2000 before going on to score on his league debut against Chelsea on 27 August 2000. Then in a league match against Ipswich Town on 9 September 2000, Nilis was involved in a clash with goalkeeper Richard Wright that left him with a double compound fracture of his right shin. At one point the injury became infected and Nilis even feared a possible amputation. This hypothesis was later ruled out, although his playing career was effectively ended.\n\nRonaldo occasionally names Nilis as one of the best strike partners he had played with despite sharing only a brief time with him at PSV. Ruud van Nistelrooy has also stated on several occasions that the Belgian was one of the best players, if not the best, he had ever played with.\n\nNilis played 56 times for the Belgian national team, scoring 10 times. A prolific goalscorer with his clubs, he scored his first goal for Belgium only on his 24th cap (a 9–0 win against Zambia).\n\nNilis played in the FIFA World Cups in 1994 and 1998. Qualification for the latter was sealed with Nilis' goals in each leg of Belgium's playoff against the Irish Republic. Nilis dropped out of international football after the 1998 Finals, reportedly in response to an \"unhealthy atmosphere within the squad and their lack of achievement\". However, with control of the Belgian national side having changed, Nilis returned to the international fold in November 1999, in time for Euro 2000, co-hosted by his birth-country Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nAfter his playing career Beringen-Heusden-Zolder were his next port of call, becoming technical director in 2005, not long before the club's liquidation after financial difficulties. Nilis took a job with PSV, first as a scout and then training the club's forwards. In January 2011, Nilis became assistant manager with Turkish club Kasımpaşa Spor Kulübü, followed by another assistant manager stint with Gençlerbirliği S.K., also in Turkey. In April 2015 he was re-hired by PSV as a striker coach.\n\nNilis's father, Roger (1938–2011), played as a professional footballer in Belgium in the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her best known roles include Natalie Hillard in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993), Susan Walker in \"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1994), Matilda Wormwood in \"Matilda\" (1996), and Lily Stone in \"Thomas and the Magic Railroad\" (2000). Since retiring from film acting, Wilson has focused on writing, penning the play \"Sheeple\" which was produced for the New York International Fringe Festival in 2013 as well as publishing a memoir, \"Where Am I Now?\":\" True Stories of Girlhood and Accidental Fame\" (2016).\n\nMara Elizabeth Wilson was born on July 24, 1987, in Burbank, California. Her father, Mike Wilson, was a television broadcast engineer, and her mother, Suzie Wilson (\"née\" Shapiro; deceased), was a homemaker. Wilson's mother was Jewish, and her father is of part Irish descent. She was raised Jewish, and became an atheist when she was 15. She has three older brothers—Danny, Jon, and Joel—and a younger sister, Anna. Political commentator Ben Shapiro is her maternal cousin. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer on March 10, 1995, and died on April 26, 1996, after production on \"Matilda\" had wrapped. Accordingly, the film was dedicated to Suzie's memory. After her mother died, Wilson lost some of her passion for acting.\n\nWilson became interested in acting after watching her oldest brother Danny act. Mara's parents refused to let her act, but they eventually reluctantly agreed to let her go into acting. After acting in commercials for Lunchables, Bank of America, Texaco, and Marshall's, Mara was invited to audition for the 1993 comedy film \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and won the part of Natalie Hillard. This was followed by the 1994 remake of \"Miracle on 34th Street\". In 1994, she had a recurring role as Nikki Petrova on \"Melrose Place\" and played Barbara Barton in the television film \"A Time to Heal\".\n\nWilson sang \"Make 'Em Laugh\" at the 67th Academy Awards telecast on March 27, 1995, with Tim Curry and Kathy Najimy. In 1995, she won the ShoWest Award for \"Young Star of the Year\". Her performances in those films caught the attention of Danny DeVito which led to her being cast as Matilda Wormwood in \"Matilda\". She then went on to star in \"A Simple Wish\" alongside Martin Short.\n\nIn 1999, she played Willow Johnson in the 1999 Disney Channel television film \"Balloon Farm\".\n\nWilson auditioned for the 1998 remake of \"The Parent Trap\", but she lost to Lindsay Lohan after being deemed too young for the role.\n\nIn 1998 Wilson went to a table reading of \"What Dreams May Come\" starring Robin Williams, but she did not get the part.\n\nWilson appeared in the 2000 children's fantasy adventure film \"Thomas and the Magic Railroad\", it was her last feature film until 2015. At that point, scripts were being sent to her that she did not have to go to auditions. After Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Wilson retired from acting.\n\nBefore taking a 12-year hiatus from acting, she got the script for \"Donnie Darko\" but declined to audition for the film.\n\nIn 2012, Wilson appeared briefly in one episode of a web series called \"Missed Connection\" in the role of Bitty and made special appearances on internet review shows for \"That Guy with the Glasses\" — most notably a comedic turn playing an adult Matilda during a review of \"Matilda\" by The Nostalgia Chick, Lindsay Ellis. That year, when asked why she quit film acting, Wilson explained: \"Film acting is not very fun. Doing the same thing over and over again until, in the director's eyes, you 'get it right', does not allow for very much creative freedom. The best times I had on film sets were the times the director let me express myself, but those were rare.\" Wilson appeared in the 2015 comedy-drama film \"Billie Bob Joe\", it was her first feature film in over 15 years.\n\nWilson has a recurring role on the podcast \"Welcome to Night Vale\" as \"The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home\", as well as her own storytelling show called \"What Are You Afraid Of?\" Her goal is to turn \"What Are You Afraid Of?\" into a podcast. In 2016, Wilson made a brief return to television by appearing as a waitress on an episode of \"Broad City\". She also voiced Jill Pill, a writer/director anthropomorphic spider, in season 3 of \"BoJack Horseman\".\n\nIn May 2013, Wilson wrote an article for online magazine Cracked.com, offering her opinion of the delinquency of some former child stars. As of that year, she worked for Publicolor. Her play \"Sheeple\" was produced in 2013 for the New York International Fringe Festival. In an interview that December, Wilson stated that her film acting days are over, and that she is instead focusing on writing.\n\nWilson went to the Idyllwild Arts Academy near Palm Springs, California, and graduated in 2009 from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. While at New York University she appeared in her own one-woman show called \"Weren't You That Girl?\"\n\nWhen Wilson was 12, she was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Wilson has struggled with anxiety and depression. In 2015, she teamed up with Project UROK, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to aid teens with mental illness. Wilson appeared in a video in which she talks about the mental illnesses she has experienced, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. She also discussed her history with mental illness on Paul Gilmartin's Mental Illness Happy Hour podcast. She has also been diagnosed with ADHD.\n\nIn 2013, Wilson lived in Queens, New York, and was involved with compulsive storytelling.\n\nFollowing the Orlando nightclub shooting in June 2016, Wilson came out as bisexual in solidarity with the LGBT community.\n\nIn an NPR interview, Nancy Cartwright stated that a young Mara Wilson was the inspiration for a character's voice on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Bart Sells His Soul\".\n\nWilson won a Young Artist Award for her role in \"A Simple Wish\" in \"Best Performance in a Feature Film Leading Young Actress\" and a Young Star Award for \"Matilda\" in \"Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Comedy Film\".

Even as a youth Fano had some reputation for learning, as is shown by the fact that Moses Cordovero (d. 1570) sent him a copy of his \"Pardes Rimmonim\". Another one of Fano's teachers was Ishmael Ḥanina b. Mordecai of Valmontone.\n\nFano was a patron of learning. When Rabbi Joseph Caro, shortly before his death (1575), sent \"Kesef Mishneh\", his commentary on Maimonides' \"Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah\", to Mantua for publication, Fano, at the suggestion of Dei Rossi, assumed part of the expense and took charge of the edition.\n\nAccording to a report of Immanuel Aboab, Fano lived for some time in Reggio Emilia. Numerous pupils flocked to him from Italy and Germany, and he was held in general respect for his learning and character.\n\nOne of Fano's sons was Isaac Berechiah; and the same name was borne also by Fano's son-in-law and pupil (mentioned in a letter of Israel Sforno to his son Obadiah ben Israel Sforno).\n\nFano's authority as a Talmudist is evident in a collection of responsa (\"She'elot Teshubot me-Rabbi Menaḥem 'Azaryah,\" Dyhernfurth, 1788) containing 130 chapters on various subjects connected with religious law and ritual questions. They are distinguished by precision of style as well as by the author's independence of the later authorities. He even decides sometimes in opposition to Joseph Caro (e.g., No. 32), and holds changes in the ritual to be justifiable in certain cases (see, e.g., No. 25). In his love for precision and brevity Fano compiled a book of extracts from Alfasi's code, which itself is only a compendium of the Talmud. This book is preserved in manuscript. Azulai enumerates twenty-four cabalistic treatises by Fano, part being in manuscript. Ten of these are comprised in the work \"'Asarah Ma'amarot\"; five of them, under the title \"Amarot Ṭehorot,\" were printed together with \"Ḳol Yehudah,\" a philosophical commentary by Judah ben Simon (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1698; Mohilev, 1810).\n\nThese treatises originated partly in addresses delivered by the author on feast-days, especially on Rosh Hashanah. In spite of Fano's decided tendency toward scholastic and allegoric interpretation, his works are not devoid of original remarks. For example, in connection with the cabalistic interpretation of Num. xxxiii. 2, \"And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys,\" he says: \"The Torah speaks always of ideas when it seems to be describing concrete things: the higher meaning is the principal thing; the lower, material meaning holds the second place. Moses b. Naḥman, indeed, follows another opinion in his commentary on Genesis in holding to the principle that 'the Torah speaks according to the manner of men'; but we can justly say that men speak according to the manner of the Torah\" (\"Ḥiḳḳur Din,\" iii. 22). \"The prohibitions of the Torah never appear in the imperative, but in the form of the future: 'Thou shalt have no other gods'; 'Thou shalt not bow down thyself to other gods'; 'Thou shalt not swear falsely'; etc. This means, 'I know thou wilt not be guilty of these things, since human nature does not tolerate such crimes, and if sin occurs in this life it can be only a passing episode.' On the other hand, the commandments are in the imperative: 'Kabbed,' 'zakor'; that is, 'I command thee nothing new; the good instincts in thee have always been there; they need only to be awakened and developed'\" (ib. iv. 9). This last sentence is characteristic of the author's optimism as well as of his mild nature, which attracted the sympathy of all.\n\nIn 1581 Jedidiah Recanati dedicated to Fano his Italian translation (\"Erudizione dei Confusi\") of Maimonides' \"Moreh Nebukim.\" Isaiah Hurwitz especially mentions Fano's treatise \"Yonat Elem\" as a theological work the teaching of which comes very near to the truth (Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, introduction to \"Nobelot Ḥokmah\"). Fano's pupil Samuel Portaleone composed an elegy on the occasion of his death (Oxford MS. No. 988c).\n\n\n\n"}

On the state's highest court, he ruled the book \"Fanny Hill\" obscene and banned its publishing in the state, issued rulings in two major murder cases, advocated for the equal citizenship rights of the mentally handicapped and was one of the few dissenting votes objecting to the jailing of a reporter who refused to turn over his notes in a murder case.\n\nPashman was born in Passaic on September 27, 1912. He graduated from Rutgers School of Law—Newark in 1936.\n\nAfter spending time in private practice, Pashman was named in 1946 to serve in Passaic on its police court, and later on its municipal court. Elected Mayor of Passaic in 1951, he served until 1955 and then served as city commissioner and director of revenue and finance.\n\nAfter two years on Passaic County Court, Governor of New Jersey Robert B. Meyner appointed him to New Jersey Superior Court in 1961. He became the assignment judge for Passaic County in 1965 and for Bergen County in 1966.\n\nIn a 1964 decision, Pashman upheld Bergen County prosecutor Guy W. Calissi's decision to ban the sale of the John Cleland book \"Fanny Hill\" in New Jersey, calling the book \"sufficiently obscene to forfeit the protection of the First Amendment of the Constitution.\" In addition to failing tests of \"social value,\" \"prurient interest\" and \"patently offensive,\" Pashman ruled that \"Fanny Hill\" failed the \"hard-core pornography test,\" noting that the \"book may be well-written but still obscene.\" The decision was overturned, and Pashman would later call his actions in the case an \"aberration,\" saying that \"I think every judge or justice is entitled to one.\"\n\nIn a 1966 ruling in a case filed by the Passaic County Bar Association, Pashman's decision stated that the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders was obligated to replace the county courthouse due to inadequate conditions in the building. A new building was constructed within four years of the order.\n\nIn a 1971 case, Pashman agreed to a plea bargain that would allow Edgar Smith to go free based on time served. Smith had been convicted of the 1957 murder of a 15-year-old cheerleader and assessed the death sentence, but the prosecutor later disclosed that critical evidence in the case was no longer available and agreed to allow Smith to plead guilty to second-degree murder, fearing that Smith would be able to claim false imprisonment.\n\nGovernor William T. Cahill named Pashman to serve as a Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court in April 1973 to replace Justice Haydn Proctor.\n\nIn the 1978 \"Dr. X\" murder trial of Mario Jascalevich, Judge Theodore Trautwein had ordered that reporter M. A. Farber of \"The New York Times\" be sent to jail for refusing to turn over notes to the defense attorney. When Farber was about to be jailed, his attorneys filed for an emergency stay on a weekend and Pashman arrived in his golfing attire to grant the stay. When the full court heard the case the next day, Pashman was the only dissenter as the court upheld the lower court ruling and ordered that Farber serve time in jail. When the court reaffirmed the lower court action in a decision in September 1978, Pashman and fellow Justice Alan B. Handler were the only dissenters.\n\nIn another 1978 case, this on challenging New Jersey's Blue Laws, the court ruled 5–2 to uphold the laws then in effect in 10 of the state's 21 counties restricting sales of certain products on Sundays. Handler and Pashman were the only dissenters, with Pashman saying that the law fails the too-frequently ignored \"test of common sense\" and that it improperly grants government the right to tell people what to do \"for their own good.\"\n\nPashman reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1982.\n\nA resident of Clifton, New Jersey, Pashman died in a New York City hospital at age 87 on October 3, 1999. He was survived by a daughter, a son, four grandsons, and three great-grandchildren.\n"}

The museum was built at the end of the 70's and was inaugurated on November 1, 1982. Its architecture was designed by architects Pirro Vaso and Pranvera Hoxha, and it has the character of a memorial that is treated as a northern Albanian tower. The name of the museum is in the honor of the Albanian national hero Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbej.\n\nThe Krujë Castle, which houses the museum, is a historic citadel. Ottoman troops attacked it thrice, in 1450, 1466 and 1467, but failed to take control. It was this impregnable fortress that helped George Kastrioti Skanderbeg defend Albania from the Ottoman invasion for more than two decades.\n\nThe National Museum \"Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu\" project was based on the conceptual platform designed by Aleks Buda in September 1976, which was sent as a design assignment to the Institute of Studies and Projets (ISP) No.1 Tirana, under the direction of architect Pirro Vaso. After reviewing three variants, the ISP decided to continue the work on designing a building based on these variants and decided that the site where the museum would be built was in the interior of the walls of the old Kruja Castle. The design team consisted of Pirro Vaso, Pranvera Hoxha, F.Stermasi, K.Meka, L.Gashi, Gjarçani and R.Agalliu, who designed a building which would be stylistic to the Albanian medieval towers, mainly built in northern Albania. After the museum's draft idea was approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture, the ISP working group started work on the project implementation of this work. The works for the construction of the National Museum \"Gjergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu\" began in September 1978 and they were directed by Robert Kote. In March 1980, the Ministry of Education and Culture set up two working groups for the preparation of the museum content model, pavilions, mural paintings, and so on. The group of historians led by prof. Kristo Frasheri and the group of painters led by Bashkim Ahmeti completed this design in the end of 1980.\n\nOn 1 November 1982, the National Museum \"Gergj Kastrioti Skenderbeu\" was inaugurated.\n\nThe museum contains objects dating back to Skanderbeg’s time. The exhibits have been arranged in a way that chronicles his life and military feats. Paintings, armor, and other artifacts dating back to his time have been exhibited to showcase one of the proudest periods of Albanian history. An interesting display is the replica of the hero’s famous goat head-topped helmet, the original of which is on display at the Kunsthistorisches Museum. The memorial building was designed by Pirro Vaso and Pranvera Hoxha.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32090391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32090391", "title": "Owl Woman", "text": "Owl Woman\n\nOwl Woman (Cheyenne name: \"Mis-stan-stur\"; died 1847) was a Cheyenne princess. She was a daughter of White Thunder, a well-respected medicine man of the Cheyenne tribe. She was married to an Anglo-American trader named William Bent, with whom she had four children. Owl Woman was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame for her role in managing relations between Native American tribes and the Anglo-American men.\n\nIn the 1820s, the central plains area in which several Native American tribes lived had been subject to political and economic turmoil resulting from the Mexican War of Independence. The Arkansas River delineated the border, with Mexico to the south and the United States northwards. There were many opportunities for trade alliances, in part to replace those that had involved the now-deposed Spanish governors, and there was also encroachment on the area by the United States as that nation pursued its policy of manifest destiny.\n\nThe area was also subject to turmoil as Native American plains tribes of the central and southern plains sought to define or redefine their territory. Tribes moved to new lands within the plains for various reasons: they may have been displaced in their previous land, had internal disputes that caused them to relocate, sought better hunting or gathering grounds, or sought land that was most conducive to their way of life. The Comanche, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Arapahoe were among the disputing tribes. The Cheyenne likely moved into the plains in the 17th and 18th century from Minnesota and by the mid-1800s lived with the Arapaho north of the Arkansas River in land near Bent's Fort in Colorado.\n\nLike other Native American tribes, the Comanche came to the grasslands of southern plains for a better life which put them at odds with other tribes. In an agreement reached with the Cheyenne, \"The Great Peace of 1840\", they agreed to stay south of the Arkansas River and the Cheyenne and Arapaho above it.\nWilliam Bent, a white trader from St Louis, came to the Arkansas River region towards the end of the 1820s. By around 1832, although possibly as late as 1834, a permanent trading post called Bent's Fort, which was a substantial adobe construction capable of accommodating 200 people, had been built on the northern \"Mountain Route\" of the Santa Fe Trail and was open for business. The location of this building was determined after discussions with the Cheyenne and was not far from La Junta, near to land occupied by the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes. It became an important center of trade, principally in buffalo robes but also in numerous other goods, including horses and mules. The fort was operated in partnership with his brother, Charles, and Ceran St Vrain, a fur trader who had already established significant trading contacts in New Mexico. Sometimes referred to as Fort William, it was in \"the perfect place at the perfect time\" for someone looking to make money from trading and, for example, a gallon of brandy bought in St Louis for 2 could be sold at the fort for 25.\n\nHyde has dated the moment that White Thunder realized a common interest with Bent. In November 1833 they talked together as a meteor shower lit up the sky over the plains. Many Cheyenne who were gathered with them believed that this celestial event was a signal of the end of the world and it was subsequently referred to as \"the Night the Stars Fell\". White Thunder saw it as a new beginning and sought both a truce with the Pawnees and the return of the Sacred Arrows of the Cheyenne which had been captured by the Pawnee during a battle. Partially successful, he returned from his solo, unarmed visit to the Pawnee village with two of the arrows and an agreement for peace. He also realized that a formal marital alliance with Bent, and in particular the children that would result from such a relationship, would represent another element of the new beginning, of peace for the Cheyenne and indeed the region.\n\nBent had already learned the language of the Cheyenne and he was known as \"Little White Man\" by the native tribes. He and his brothers had been given native names upon their first meeting with Cheyenne in the area, which had been a convivial occasion during which their respect for the Cheyenne protocols had set a firm base for their future development of the fort and trading.\n\nThe fort and the area immediately outside it was a multi-cultural, multilingual center with permanent inhabitants from many nations and also visitors, including the temporary camps of native tribes such as the Sioux, Apache and Kiowa, as well as Comanche and Cheyenne. It was the hub of a trading area that encompassed a 500-mile radius and was visited each year by hundreds of wagons traveling the Santa Fe trail. Hyde writes in \"Empires, Nations and Families\" that \"Bent's Fort was the one spot on the Santa Fe trail where exchanges with Indians were welcomed and encouraged, and the effects of those conversations on both sides were far-reaching ... archeological evidence tells us that people sat in the courtyard together and smoked—a lot\". Bent managed trade to and from the fort: he provided a safe zone in the area and a supply of goods for its store, as well as facilitating the movement of buffalo robes back to St. Louis for sale.\n\nSitting on the Santa Fe trail, Bent's Fort was a resting stop for travelers, some staying as much as three weeks. From fall through spring the fort was busy with people wishing to trade and travelers to rest and restock their supplies. Visitors and employees included: Mexicans, Native Americans, and European travelers and trappers. There were also three African American slaves owned by the Bents. Up to 100 employees needed to support the fort and trade included: clerks, guards, traders, teamsters, trappers, a tailor, blacksmith, carpenter and herders. Caravans took goods to trade with regional Native American tribes.\n\nThe fort was usually relatively empty during the summer months and during that period Bent would often be riding the six-month journey on the trail to and from Westport, Missouri in order to trade the goods gathered over the previous winter and replenish the stocks of the fort for the forthcoming hunting season. While Bent and the trains were away the fort managed with a skeleton crew of herders, clerks, traders and laborers for Native Americans and travelers.\n\nWilliam and Charles owned African slaves Andrew and Dick Green and brought them from Missouri to assist in the running of the fort. Dick Green's wife, Charlotte, a negro cook who described herself as the only female American woman to George Ruxton at the time of his visit in 1848 as \"de only lady in de whole damn Injun country\". She was notorious for her cooking among fur traders and travelers. One person called her a \"culinary divinity\". Bent's Fort held dances regularly; Charlotte was described by Colonel Henry Inman as \"the center of attention, the belle of the evening. She knew her worth and danced accordingly.\" Dick was released from slavery by George and William Bent after his heroic efforts in a battle in 1847 at Taos after the death of Charles Bent. Dick, who has been stationed with Charles Bent in Santa Fe, made his way north with American soldiers to Bent's Taos home. He bravely led a skirmish against a group of Taos Pueblo and other people. Dick was severely wounded but survived a trip back to Bent's fort. Charlotte, who Simmons claims was also Charles and William's slave, left the fort with her husband.\n\nIn the period immediately prior to the marriage of Owl Woman to Bent both the Cheyenne and the Arapahoe had become eager to work with the incoming trade caravans, and notably those associated with Bent. Unlike many other tribes in the area, they saw these caravans as an opportunity for enrichment rather than as a threat. The Cheyenne in particular had reason to favor Bent because he had on one occasion intervened to protect them against Comanche raiders. However, the disparity in how the long-settled and the recently settled tribes viewed the influx of new traders exacerbated intertribal rivalries and resulted in White Thunder making a decision that was calamitous for both his tribe and his reputation. In 1833 he led the Cheyenne into a fight with the Pawnees, the outcome of which was not merely a considerable loss of life but also the loss of the four arrows. This symbolic capture by the Pawnees represented a huge loss of respect and status for White Thunder and his tribe.\n\nBent had been doing much to negotiate a resolution to the intertribal disputes, as well as raids on settlers and traders. An uneasy truce had developed which, in its turn, had enhanced his own status and trading position. Anne Hyde has described the overall situation that came to exist in the area as being similar to that prevailing in northern California, a \"negotiated community ... Only constant renegotiation and the conscious creation of community through family ties, diplomacy, warfare, and dinner made it operate in a surprisingly stable way.\"\n\nThe trading environment improved after 1840, when Bent's Fort became the site of a truce between the Comanche, Apache and Kiowa tribes on the one hand and the Cheyenne and Arapahoe on the other, creating what Hyde describes as \"network of enormous significance.\" The Comanche, in particular, had for many years protected their territory to the south of the Arkansas River against almost all who attempted to move into it. They had built up their power with a deep knowledge of their territory, shrewd trading arrangements, and their willingness to indulge in raids against those who threatened or breached those arrangements. Indeed, their grip on the territory to the south of the river was one of the reasons why Bent's Fort had been constructed on the opposite side. Although they had continued to assert their power after Mexican independence, the influx of displaced tribes from elsewhere, the westward push of white settlers and the development of the Santa Fe Trail meant that there were many bloody battles and much loss of life. These culminated in a Comanche raid on the fort and its surroundings in 1839 and a retaliatory raid by the Cheyenne. Realizing that long-term peace was preferable to reciprocating attacks, this was agreed and the formalization of the arrangement at the fort over several weeks during the summer of 1840 saw Bent playing a central role as host to the various camps and their celebrations. Hyde has said that George Ruxton subsequently observed, in 1848, how the council room at the fort was used, \"Chiefs of the Shain, Kioway and Araphó sit in solemn conclave with the head traders, and smoke the \"calumet\" over their real and imaginary grievances.\"\n\nOwl Woman, whose date of birth is unrecorded, was the oldest daughter of White Thunder and Tail Woman. She had at least two younger sisters, Yellow Woman and Island. Her father was an influential Cheyenne leader who acted as the tribe's \"Keeper of the Arrows,\" four arrows thought to have a sacred or medicinal role. The prestige of his position as a spiritual leader or medicine man was reflected on to his daughters.\n\nThe Cheyenne were a nomadic plains tribe who followed and hunted buffalo. They were described as \"tall, well built with even features\" and regarded as \"honorable, intelligent, honest and clean\".\n\nIt was not uncommon at this time for white men living in the area, usually working as traders or trappers, to take a Native American wife. Often these relationships lasted only until the men left the frontier territory, but while they existed they were of mutual benefit. Bent and Owl Woman's relationship, however, was a partnership that ultimately \"resulted in children, wealth and power.\" From Bent's point of view, marriage to a Cheyenne would not merely provide him with female companionship and a social escort for functions held at the fort but, perhaps more importantly, reinforce an alliance with the tribe that would be a useful adjunct to his burgeoning trading activities. From the perspective of White Thunder, it would bolster his tribe's already friendly relationship with Bent and thus provide protection for them, and on a more personal level it would re-establish some of his prestige within the tribe itself.\n\nTo observe the formal rituals of the Cheyenne, he obtained consent from White Thunder to court Owl Woman. So much as talking to a Cheyenne girl was considered to be courtship by the tribe and, as such, it was necessary to obtain the permission first in order not to cause offence. There were other pre-courtship rituals, such as an exchange of ponies between the two men, and during the courtship itself Bent and Owl Woman were always chaperoned by Yellow Woman, in accordance with the Cheyenne belief in remaining celibate until marriage. To signal Bent's request to marry Owl Woman, he arrived at White Thunder's camp with horses and gifts and smoked a peace pipe of tobacco with Owl Woman's father in a ritualistic ceremony. Although Owl Woman wanted to marry Bent, the decision for the couple to marry was made by White Thunder by joining William Bent's hands with Owl Woman's hands. This signified both the acceptance of Owl Woman as William Bent's wife, but also an agreement for William Bent to also accept Owl Woman's sister Yellow Woman.\n\nThe couple married in a Cheyenne ceremony in 1835, per Britney Nelson of the Colorado Historical Society, or as others claim by 1837. As a part of the ritual, Owl Woman was carried into a lodge which was constructed for them in the Cheyenne village near the fort, while Bent dispensed largesse in the form of numerous gifts. Bent later became a \"Cheyenne sub-chief\", having attained tribal membership with his marriage to Owl Woman.\n\nThe couple each spent time at their partner's residence: the lodge created for Owl Woman and Bent's quarters within the fort, which were furnished according to their backgrounds. Owl Woman did not prefer to stay the fort, where her room was dark and near the loud, smoky blacksmith shop. The horses and pack animals were also loud and smelly. On the other hand, her lodge was quiet and lit through the parchment-like paper of the roof. Horses grazed on the hills. In the lodge built for Owl Woman and Bent, a shrine-like area held sacred and religious items. Supplies were stowed away, including cooking utensils, food, clothing, bedding, riding gear and weapons.\n\nBy the 1840s two of Owl Woman's younger sisters, Island and Yellow Woman, joined them, in accordance with tribal custom for successful men. In 1845 Yellow Woman bore William a boy named Charley, or Pe-ki-ree meaning White Hat in Cheyenne.\n\nIn April Bent left the fort for the six-month supply train journey to Missouri. During the summer months his family went back and forth between the fort and the nearby Cheyenne village and were in the fort by autumn.\n\n\nSeasonally the Cheyenne moved down the Arkansas River to Big Timbers. Alongside the Arkansas River for Big Timbers was a prime location for hunting buffalo, a major source of food for the Cheyenne. The tribe also lived on roots and berries. Big Timbers was their desired camp site in the winter.\n\nAccording to Hyde, Owl Woman and her children traveled with her tribe to Big Timbers during the winter months and were at the fort itself during the summer. During the Cheyenne's winter visit to Big Timbers, Bent accompanied his family with goods for trading. At Big Timbers, Bent lived according to Cheyenne custom when he lived with them in a more casual, unstructured way of life. While Bent's Fort life was somewhat structured with William having a leadership role.\n\nWithin a short time after the marriage the couple were, according to Hyde, \"the central business and social leaders of the region\", having combined their familial and trading connections with the various tribes, the traders, and the authorities of both New Mexico and the US Army to considerable effect. They were both active peacemakers among the natives, explorers, and settlers who visited the fort: Mexican traders, American explorers, African slaves, hunters and trappers and members of many area Native American tribes.\n\nOwl Woman worked in the fort and often managed the supply trains. Her position enabled her to deter predatory tribes who might have designs on the trade caravans, this [reputedly] being achieved by her flashing a signal using a mirror.\n\nIt was while at the fort in 1845 that topographical engineer Lieutenant James W. Abert asked Owl Woman to sit for him as the subject of a watercolor painting. He described that:\n\nThe real fruit of the marriage was always anticipated to be the children, of whom they raised four together. These were named in English and Cheyenne:\n\nLife at the fort, called the \"mud castle of the plains\", reflected the heritage of both parents. The children's clothes included linen shirts and soft-leather moccasins. There they ate on fine china and, according to Cheyenne custom, slept on the ground in soft hides. The furnishings and household goods included items from America, Mexico and international locations. Children enjoyed pumpkin pie and pancakes made by the Charlotte, a slave in service to the Bents. Chipita, the French-Mexican wife to a Bent worker, made taffy for the children; She performed housekeeping and laundry services at the fort.\n\nOwl Woman's mother taught the children to be respectful and courteous of their elders. Discipline was given through stern glances and waving fingers by his mother and his aunts. In their multi-cultural environment, the children learned to speak many languages; George learned how to speak Cheyenne, English, Spanish, Comanche, Kiowa and Arapaho. The boys learned to ride horses bareback, control the horses actions through softly worded commands, hunt and to be warriors. The girls learned how to perform chores, like gathering wood, fetching water, and picking berries.  Girls were also taught to be gracious, generous hosts. George Bent recalled of his childhood at the fort:\nLife for the Bent family changed dramatically over six years after Owl Woman's death. In 1849 a cholera epidemic swept through the Cheyenne tribe killing up to half of the people, including the children's grandmother, Tail Woman. Demand in fur declined, with a resulting drop in William Bent's business at the fort. In 1853 Bent established a stone fort in the Big Timbers area.\n\nFrom 1854, subsequent to the death of Owl Woman, George was sent away to be educated at a school run by an Episcopalian in Westport, Missouri, causing him to be separated from his family for much of the time.\n\nThe death of Owl Woman from complications of the birth of Julia, (who was born in 1844) in 1847 was not witnessed by Bent as he was away at that time. Bent mourned deeply for Owl Woman. Her sister Island took responsibility for raising Bent and Owl Woman's children.\n\nOwl Woman, described as \"a most estimable good woman of much influence in the tribe\", had worked to manage and improve relations between Native American tribes and the white man during her life. Hyde notes that \n\nTheir vision did not last, being overtaken by wider events as the years passed by, but the contribution of Owl Woman was recognized posthumously. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "231555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231555", "title": "Prince Marko", "text": "Prince Marko\n\nMarko Mrnjavčević (, ;  – 17 May 1395) was the \"de jure\" Serbian king from 1371 to 1395, while he was the \"de facto\" ruler of territory in western Macedonia centered on the town of Prilep. He is known as Prince Marko (, \"Kraljević Marko\", ) and King Marko (; ) in South Slavic oral tradition, in which he has become a major character during the period of Ottoman rule over the Balkans. Marko's father, King Vukašin, was co-ruler with Serbian Tsar Stefan Uroš V, whose reign was characterised by weakening central authority and the gradual disintegration of the Serbian Empire. Vukašin's holdings included lands in western Macedonia and Kosovo. In 1370 or 1371, he crowned Marko \"young king\"; this title included the possibility that Marko would succeed the childless Uroš on the Serbian throne.\n\nOn 26 September 1371, Vukašin was killed and his forces defeated in the Battle of Maritsa. About two months later, Tsar Uroš died. This formally made Marko the king of the Serbian land; however, Serbian noblemen, who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler. Sometime after 1371, he became an Ottoman vassal; by 1377, significant portions of the territory he inherited from Vukašin were seized by other noblemen. King Marko, in reality, came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near Skopje (better known as Marko's Monastery), which was completed in 1376. Marko died on 17 May 1395, fighting for the Ottomans against the Wallachians in the Battle of Rovine.\n\nAlthough a ruler of modest historical significance, Marko became a major character in South Slavic oral tradition. He is venerated as a national hero by the Serbs, Macedonians and Bulgarians, remembered in Balkan folklore as a fearless and powerful protector of the weak, who fought against injustice and confronted the Turks during the Ottoman occupation.\n\nMarko was born about 1335 as the first son of Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his wife Alena. The patronymic \"Mrnjavčević\" derives from Mrnjava, described by 17th-century Ragusan historian Mavro Orbin as a minor nobleman from Zachlumia (in present-day Herzegovina and southern Dalmatia). According to Orbin, Mrnjava's sons were born in Livno in western Bosnia, where he may have moved after Zachlumia was annexed from Serbia by Bosnia in 1326. The Mrnjavčević family may have later supported Serbian Emperor (tsar) Stefan Dušan in his preparations to invade Bosnia as did other Zachlumian nobles, and, fearing punishment, emigrated to the Serbian Empire before the war started. These preparations possibly began two years ahead of the invasion, which took place in 1350. From that year comes the earliest written reference to Marko's father Vukašin, describing him as Dušan's appointed \"župan\" (district governor) of Prilep, which was acquired by Serbia from Byzantium in 1334 with other parts of Macedonia. In 1355, at about age 47, Stefan Dušan died suddenly of a stroke.\n\nDušan was succeeded by his 19-year-old son Uroš, who apparently regarded Marko Mrnjavčević as a man of trust. The new Emperor appointed him the head of the embassy he sent to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia) at the end of July 1361 to negotiate peace between the empire and the Ragusan Republic after hostilities earlier that year. Although peace was not reached, Marko successfully negotiated the release of Serbian merchants from Prizren who were detained by the Ragusans and was permitted to withdraw silver deposited in the city by his family. The account of that embassy in a Ragusan document contains the earliest-known, undisputed reference to Marko Mrnjavčević. An inscription written in 1356 on a wall of a church in the Macedonian region of Tikveš, mentions a Nikola and a Marko as governors in that region, but the identity of this Marko is disputed.\n\nDušan's death was followed by the stirring of separatist activity in the Serbian Empire. The south-western territories, including Epirus, Thessaly, and lands in southern Albania, seceded by 1357. However, the core of the state (the western lands, including Zeta and Travunia with the upper Drina Valley; the central Serbian lands; and Macedonia), remained loyal to Emperor Uroš. Nevertheless, local noblemen asserted more and more independence from Uroš' authority even in the part of the state that remained Serbian. Uroš was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in his own domain. Serbian lords also fought each other for territory and influence.\n\nVukašin Mrnjavčević was a skilful politician, and gradually assumed the main role in the empire. In August or September 1365 Uroš crowned him king, making him his co-ruler. By 1370 Marko's potential patrimony increased as Vukašin expanded his personal holdings from Prilep further into Macedonia, Kosovo and Metohija, acquiring Prizren, Pristina, Novo Brdo, Skopje and Ohrid. In a charter he issued on 5 April 1370 Vukašin mentioned his wife (Queen Alena) and sons (Marko and Andrijaš), signing himself as \"Lord of the Serb and Greek Lands, and of the Western Provinces\" (). In late 1370 or early 1371 Vukašin crowned Marko \"Young King\", a title given to heirs presumptive of Serbian kings to secure their position as successors to the throne. Since Uroš was childless Marko could thus become his successor, beginning a new—Vukašin's—dynasty of Serbian sovereigns, and ending the two-century Nemanjić dynasty. Most Serbian lords were unhappy with the situation, which strengthened their desire for independence from the central authority.\n\nVukašin sought a well-connected spouse for Marko. A princess from the Croatian House of Šubić of Dalmatia was sent by her father, Grgur, to the court of their relative Tvrtko I, the ban of Bosnia. She was supposed to be raised and married by Tvrtko's mother Jelena. Jelena was the daughter of George II Šubić, whose maternal grandfather was Serbian King Dragutin Nemanjić. The ban and his mother approved of Vukašin's idea to join the Šubić princess and Marko, and the wedding was imminent. However, in April 1370 Pope Urban V sent Tvrtko a letter forbidding him to give the Catholic lady in marriage to the \"son of His Magnificence, the King of Serbia, a schismatic\" (\"filio magnifici viri Regis Rascie scismatico\"). The pope also notified King Louis I of Hungary, nominal overlord of the ban, of the impending \"offence to the Christian faith\", and the marriage did not occur. Marko subsequently married Jelena (daughter of Radoslav Hlapen, the lord of Veria and Edessa and the major Serbian nobleman in southern Macedonia).\n\nDuring the spring of 1371, Marko participated in the preparations for a campaign against Nikola Altomanović, the major lord in the west of the Empire. The campaign was planned jointly by King Vukašin and Đurađ I Balšić, lord of Zeta (who was married to Olivera, the king's daughter). In July of that year Vukašin and Marko camped with their army outside Scutari, on Balšić's territory, ready to make an incursion towards Onogošt in Altomanović's land. The attack never took place, since the Ottomans threatened the land of Despot Jovan Uglješa (lord of Serres and Vukašin's younger brother, who ruled in eastern Macedonia) and the Mrnjavčević forces were quickly directed eastward. Having sought allies in vain, the two brothers and their troops entered Ottoman-controlled territory. At the Battle of Maritsa on 26 September 1371, the Turks annihilated the Serbian army; the bodies of Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa were never found. The battle site, near the village of Ormenio in present-day eastern Greece, has ever since been called as \"Sırp Sındığı\" (\"Serbian rout\") in Turkish. The Battle of Maritsa had far-reaching consequences for the region, since it opened the Balkans to the Turks.\n\nWhen his father died, \"young king\" Marko became king and co-ruler with Emperor Uroš. The Nemanjić dynasty ended soon afterwards, when Uroš died on 2 (or 4) December 1371 and Marko became the formal sovereign of Serbia. Serbian lords, however, did not recognise him, and divisions within the state increased. After the two brothers' deaths and the destruction of their armies, the Mrnjavčević family was left powerless. Lords around Marko exploited the opportunity to seize significant parts of his patrimony. By 1372 Đurađ I Balšić took Prizren and Peć, and Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović took Pristina. By 1377 Vuk Branković acquired Skopje, and Albanian magnate Andrea Gropa became virtually independent in Ohrid; however, he may have remained a vassal to Marko as he had been to Vukašin. Gropa's son-in-law was Marko's relative, Ostoja Rajaković of the clan of Ugarčić from Travunia. He was one of Serbian noblemen from Zachlumia and Travunia (adjacent principalities in present-day Herzegovina) who received lands in the newly conquered parts of Macedonia during Emperor Dušan's reign.\n\nThe only sizable town kept by Marko was Prilep, from which his father rose. King Marko became a petty prince ruling a relatively small territory in western Macedonia, bordered in the north by the Šar mountains and Skopje; in the east by the Vardar and the Crna Reka rivers, and in the west by Ohrid. The southern limits of his territory are uncertain. Marko shared his rule with his younger brother, Andrijaš, who had his own land. Their mother, Queen Alena, became a nun after Vukašin's death, taking the monastic name Jelisaveta, but was co-ruler with Andrijaš for some time after 1371. The youngest brother, Dmitar, lived on land controlled by Andrijaš. There was another brother, Ivaniš, about whom little is known. When Marko became an Ottoman vassal is uncertain, but it was probably not immediately after the Battle of Maritsa.\n\nAt some point Marko separated from Jelena and lived with Todora, the wife of a man named Grgur, and Jelena returned to her father in Veria. Marko later sought to reconcile with Jelena but he had to send Todora to his father-in-law. Since Marko's land was bordered on the south by Hlapen's, the reconciliation may have been political. Scribe Dobre, a subject of Marko's, transcribed a liturgical book for the church in the village of Kaluđerec, and when he finished, he composed an inscription which begins as follows:\n\nMarko's fortress was on a hill north of present-day Prilep; its partially preserved remains are known as \"Markovi Kuli\" (\"Marko's towers\"). Beneath the fortress is the village of Varoš, site of the medieval Prilep. The village contains the Monastery of Archangel Michael, renovated by Marko and Vukašin, whose portraits are on the walls of the monastery's church. Marko was ktetor of the Church of Saint Sunday in Prizren, which was finished in 1371, shortly before the Battle of Maritsa. In the inscription above the church's entrance, he is called \"young king\".\n\nThe Monastery of St. Demetrius, popularly known as Marko's Monastery, is in the village of Markova Sušica (near Skopje) and was built from c. 1345 to 1376 (or 1377). Kings Marko and Vukašin, its \"ktetors\", are depicted over the south entrance of the monastery church. Marko is an austere-looking man in purple clothes, wearing a crown decorated with pearls. With his left hand he holds a scroll, whose text begins: \"I, in the Christ God the pious King Marko, built and inscribed this divine temple ...\" In his right hand, he holds a horn symbolizing the horn of oil with which the Old Testament kings were anointed at their coronation (as described in 1 Samuel ). Marko is said to be shown here as the king chosen by God to lead his people through the crisis following the Battle of Maritsa.\n\nMarko minted his own money, in common with his father and other Serbian nobles of the time. His silver coins weighed 1.11 grams, and were produced in three types. In two of them, the obverse contained a five-line text: (\"In the Christ God, the pious King Marko\"). In the first type, the reverse depicted Christ seated on a throne; in the second, Christ was seated on a mandorla. In the third type, the reverse depicted Christ on a mandorla; the obverse contained the four-line text (\"Pious King Marko\"), which Marko also used in the church inscription. He omitted a territorial designation from his title, probably in tacit acknowledgement of his limited power. Although his brother Andrijaš also minted his own coins, the money supply in the territory ruled by the Mrnjavčević brothers primarily consisted of coins struck by King Vukašin and Tsar Uroš. About 150 of Marko's coins survive in numismatic collections.\n\nBy 1379, Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, the ruler of Moravian Serbia, emerged as the most-powerful Serbian nobleman. Although he called himself Autokrator of all the Serbs (), he was not strong enough to unite all Serbian lands under his authority. The Balšić and Mrnjavčević families, Konstantin Dragaš (maternally a Nemanjić), Vuk Branković and Radoslav Hlapen continued ruling their respective regions. In addition to Marko, Tvrtko I was crowned King of the Serbs and of Bosnia in 1377 in the Mileševa monastery. Maternally related to the Nemanjić dynasty, Tvrtko had seized western portions of the former Serbian Empire in 1373.\n\nOn 15 June 1389 Serbian forces led by Prince Lazar, Vuk Branković, and Tvrtko's nobleman Vlatko Vuković of Zachlumia, confronted the Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad I at the Battle of Kosovo, the best-known battle in medieval Serbian history. With the bulk of both armies wiped out and Lazar and Murad killed, the outcome of the battle was inconclusive. In its aftermath the Serbs had insufficient manpower to defend their lands, while the Ottomans had many more troops in the east. Serbian principalities which were not already Ottoman vassals became such over the next few years.\n\nIn 1394, a group of Ottoman vassals in the Balkans renounced their vassalage. Although Marko was not among them, his younger brothers Andrijaš and Dmitar refused to remain under Ottoman dominance. They emigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary, entering the service of King Sigismund. They travelled via Ragusa, where they withdrew two-thirds of their late father's store of of silver, leaving the remaining third for Marko. Although Andrijaš and Dmitar were the first Serbian nobles to emigrate to Hungary, the Serbian northward migration would continue throughout the Ottoman occupation.\n\nIn 1395 the Ottomans attacked Wallachia to punish its ruler, Mircea I, for his incursions into their territory. Three Serbian vassals fought on the Ottoman side: King Marko, Lord Konstantin Dragaš, and Despot Stefan Lazarević (son and heir of Prince Lazar). The Battle of Rovine, on 17 May 1395, was won by the Wallachians; Marko and Dragaš were killed. After their deaths the Ottomans annexed their lands, combining them into an Ottoman province centred in Kyustendil. Thirty-six years after the Battle of Rovine, Konstantin the Philosopher wrote the \"Biography of Despot Stefan Lazarević\" and recorded what Marko said to Dragaš on the eve of the battle: \"I pray the Lord to help the Christians, no matter if I will be the first to die in this war.\" The chronicle goes on to state that Marko and Dragaš were killed in the battle. Another medieval source that mentions Marko's death at the Battle of Rovine is the Dečani Chronicle.\n\nMarko Mrnjavčević is the most popular hero of Serbian epic poetry, in which he is called \"Kraljević Marko\" (with the word \"kraljević\" meaning \"prince\" or \"king's son\"). This informal title was attached to King Vukašin's sons in contemporary sources as a surname (Marko Kraljević), and it was adopted by the Serbian oral tradition as part of Marko's name.\n\nPoems about Kraljević Marko do not follow a storyline; what binds them into a poetic cycle is the hero himself, with his adventures illuminating his character and personality. The epic Marko had a 300-year lifespan; 14th- to 16th-century heroes appearing as his companions include Miloš Obilić, Relja Krilatica, Vuk the Fiery Dragon and Sibinjanin Janko and his nephew, Banović Sekula. Very few historical facts about Marko can be found in the poems, but they reflect his connection with the disintegration of the Serbian Empire and his vassalage to the Ottomans. They were composed by anonymous Serbian poets during the Ottoman occupation of their land. According to American Slavicist George Rapall Noyes, they \"combine tragic pathos with almost ribald comedy in a fashion worthy of an Elizabethan playwright.\"\n\nSerbian epic poetry agrees that King Vukašin was Marko's father. His mother in the poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, the lord of the Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is described as a man of immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre with eyes. Vukašin murdered him with the help of the voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a \"vila\" (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.\n\nAs Marko matured, he became headstrong; Vukašin once said that he had no control over his son, who went wherever he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into a large, strong man, with a terrifying appearance, which was also somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap pulled low over his dark eyes, his black moustache was the size of a six-month-old lamb and his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A Damascus sabre swung at his waist, and a spear was slung across his back. Marko's pernach weighed 66 okas () and hung on the left side of his saddle, balanced by a well-filled wineskin on the saddle's right side. His grip was strong enough to squeeze drops of water from a piece of dry cornel wood. Marko defeated a succession of champions against overwhelming odds.\n\nThe hero's inseparable companion was his powerful, talking piebald horse Šarac; Marko always gave him an equal share of his wine. The horse could leap three spear-lengths high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko to capture the dangerous, elusive \"vila\" Ravijojla. She became his blood sister, promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted Musa Kesedžija (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain a better man than himself.\n\nMarko is portrayed as a protector of the weak and helpless, a fighter against Turkish bullies and injustice in general. He was an idealised keeper of patriarchal and natural norms: in a Turkish military camp, he beheaded the Turk who dishonourably killed his father. He abolished the marriage tax by killing the tyrant who imposed it on the people of Kosovo. He saved the sultan's daughter from an unwanted marriage after she entreated him, as her blood brother, to help her. He rescued three Serbian voivodes (his blood brothers) from a dungeon and helped animals in distress. Marko was a rescuer and benefactor of people, and a promoter of life; \"Prince Marko is remembered like a fair day in the year\".\n\nCharacteristic of Marko was his reverence and love for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, following it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good on the path of moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.\n\nMarko is represented as a loyal vassal of the Ottoman sultan, fighting to protect the potentate and his empire from outlaws. When summoned by the sultan, he participated in Turkish military campaigns. Even in this relationship, however, Marko's personality and sense of dignity were apparent. He occasionally made the sultan uneasy, and meetings between them usually ended like this:\n\nMarko's fealty was combined with the notion that the servant was greater than his lord, as Serbian poets turned the tables on their conquerors. This dual aspect of Marko may explain his heroic status; for the Serbs he was \"the proud symbol expressive of the unbroken spirit that lived on in spite of disaster and defeat,\" according to translator of Serbian epic poems David Halyburton Low.\n\nIn battle, Marko used not only his strength and prowess but cunning and trickery. Despite his extraordinary qualities he was not depicted as a superhero or a god, but as a mortal man. There were opponents who surpassed him in courage and strength. He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental goodness.\n\nWith his comic appearance and behaviour, and his remarks at his opponents' expense, Marko is the most humorous character in Serbian epic poetry. When a Moor struck him with a mace, Marko said laughingly, \"O valiant black Moor! Are you jesting or smiting in earnest?\" Jevrosima once advised her son to cease his bloody adventures and plough the fields instead. He obeyed in a grimly humorous way, ploughing the sultan's highway instead of the fields. A group of Turkish Janissaries with three packs of gold shouted at him to stop ploughing the highway. He warned them to keep off the furrows, but quickly wearied of arguing:\n\nMarko, age 300, rode the 160-year-old Šarac by the seashore towards Mount Urvina when a \"vila\" told him that he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the \"vila\"s words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.\n\n\"Krali Marko\" has been one of the most popular characters in Bulgarian folklore for centuries. Bulgarian epic tales in general (and those about Marko in particular) seem to originate from the southwestern part of the Bulgarian region, primarily in the present-day Republic of Macedonia. Therefore, the tales are also part of the ethnic heritage of present-day Macedonia.\n\nAccording to local legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), sister of the Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled territory in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three \"narecnitsi\" (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting that he would be a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A \"samodiva\" named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the \"samodiva\"s milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia (\"dappled\") and a stepsister, the \"samodiva\" Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.\nBulgarian folklorists who collected stories about Marko included educator Trayko Kitanchev (in the Resen region of western Macedonia) and Marko Cepenkov of Prilep (throughout the region).\n\nSouth Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are primarily based on myths much older than the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He was said to have helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija (\"Iron Gate\") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.\n\nLegend also has it that Marko acquired his strength after he was suckled by a \"vila\". King Vukašin threw him into a river because he did not resemble him, but the boy was saved by a cowherd (who adopted him, and a \"vila\" suckled him). In other accounts, Marko was a shepherd (or cowherd) who found a \"vila\"s children lost in a mountain and shaded them against the sun (or gave them water). As a reward the \"vila\" suckled him three times, and he could lift and throw a large boulder. An Istrian version has Marko making a shade for two snakes, instead of the children. In a Bulgarian version, each of the three draughts of milk he suckled from the \"vila\"s breast became a snake.\n\nMarko was associated with large, solitary boulders and indentations in rocks; the boulders were said to be thrown by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he did something memorable. They were often named after him, and there are many toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.\n\nIn some legends, Marko's wonder horse was a gift from a \"vila\". A Serbian story says that he was looking for a horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an enormously powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a \"vila\"s advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.\n\nAccording to folk tradition Marko never died; he lives on in a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, \"Oh God, what am I going to do now?\" God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls on the ground and Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank \"eagle's water\", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Marko was the subject of several dramatizations. In 1831 the Hungarian drama \"Prince Marko\", possibly written by , was performed in Buda and in 1838, the Hungarian drama \"Prince Marko – Great Serbian Hero\" by Celesztin Pergő was staged in Arad. In 1848 Jovan Sterija Popović wrote the tragedy \"The Dream of Prince Marko\", in which the legend of sleeping Marko is its central motif. Petar Preradović wrote the drama \"Kraljević Marko\", which glorifies southern Slav strength. In 1863 Francesco Dall'Ongaro presented his Italian drama, \"The Resurrection of Prince Marko\". In her collection of short stories from 1978, Nouvelles Orientales, Marguerite Yourcenar imagined an alternative, inexplicable end to Marko's life (La Fin de Marko kraliévitch).\n\nOf all Serbian epic or historical figures, Marko is considered to have given the most inspiration to visual artists; a monograph on the subject lists 87 authors. His oldest known depictions are 14th-century frescoes from Marko's Monastery and Prilep. An 18th-century drawing of Marko is found in the Čajniče Gospels, a medieval parchment manuscript belonging to a Serbian Orthodox church in Čajniče in eastern Bosnia. The drawing is simple, unique in depicting Marko as a saint and reminiscent of stećci reliefs. Vuk Karadžić wrote that during his late-18th-century childhood he saw a painting of Marko carrying an ox on his back.\n\nNineteenth-century lithographs of Marko were made by Anastas Jovanović, Ferdo Kikerec and others. Artists who painted Marko during that century include Mina Karadžić, Novak Radonić and Đura Jakšić. Twentieth-century artists include Nadežda Petrović, Mirko Rački, Uroš Predić and Paja Jovanović. A sculpture of Marko on Šarac by Ivan Meštrović was reproduced on a Yugoslavian banknote and stamp. Modern illustrators with Marko as their subject include Alexander Key, Aleksandar Klas, Zuko Džumhur, Vasa Pomorišac and Bane Kerac.\n\nPrinc Marko, and his Sabre was also inspiration for Current Serbian National Anthem \"Boze Pravde\". The song was taken from a theatre piece Markova Sablja, very popular among Serbs in 1872.\n\nMotifs in multiple works are Marko and Ravijojla, Marko and his mother, Marko and Šarac, Marko shooting an arrow, Marko plowing the roads, the fight between Marko and Musa and Marko's death. Also, several artists have tried to produce a realistic portrait of Marko based on his frescoes. In 1924 Prilep Brewery introduced a light beer, \"Krali Marko\".\n\n\nThe family name \"Mrnjavčević\" was not mentioned in contemporary sources, nor was any other surname associated with this family. The oldest known source mentioning the name \"Mrnjavčević\" is \"Ruvarčev rodoslov\" \"The Genealogy of Ruvarac\", written between 1563 and 1584. It is unknown whether it was introduced into the Genealogy from some older source, or from the folk poetry and tradition.\nThis liturgical book, acquired in the 19th century by Russian collector Aleksey Khludov, is kept today in the State Historical Museum of Russia.\nThe name Despotović (\"despot's son\") was applied in a similar way to Uglješa, the son of Despot Jovan Uglješa, King Vukašin's younger brother.\n\n\nVideos of Serbian epic poems sung to the accompaniment of the gusle:\n"}

{"id": "33183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33183", "title": "Woman", "text": "Woman\n\nA woman is a female human being. The term \"woman\" is usually reserved for an adult, with \"girl\" being the usual term for a female child or adolescent. The term \"woman\" is also sometimes used to identify a female human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as \"women's rights\". Women with typical genetic development are usually capable of giving birth from puberty until menopause. There are also trans women (those who have a male sex assignment that does not align with their gender identity), and intersex women (those born with sexual characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male or female).\n\nThe spelling of \"woman\" in English has progressed over the past millennium from \"wīfmann\" to \"wīmmann\" to \"wumman\", and finally, the modern spelling \"woman\". In Old English, \"wīfmann\" meant \"female human\", whereas \"wēr\" meant \"male human\". \"Mann\" or \"monn\" had a gender-neutral meaning of \"human\", corresponding to Modern English \"person\" or \"someone\"; however, subsequent to the Norman Conquest, \"man\" began to be used more in reference to \"male human\", and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term \"wēr\". The medial labial consonants f and m in \"wīfmann\" coalesced into the modern form \"woman\", while the initial element \"wīf\", which meant \"female\", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman (\"wife\").\n\nIt is a popular misconception that the term \"woman\" is etymologically connected to \"womb\". \"Womb\" is actually from the Old English word \"wambe\" meaning \"stomach\" (modern German retains the colloquial term \"Wampe\" from Middle High German for \"potbelly\").\n\nThe symbol for the planet and goddess Venus or Aphrodite in Greek is the sign also used in biology for the female sex. It is a stylized representation of the goddess Venus's hand-mirror or an abstract symbol for the goddess: a circle with a small equilateral cross underneath. The Venus symbol also represented femininity, and in ancient alchemy stood for copper. Alchemists constructed the symbol from a circle (representing spirit) above an equilateral cross (representing matter).\n\nWomanhood is the period in a human female's life after she has passed through childhood and adolescence, generally around age 18.\n\nThe word \"woman\" can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with \"girl\". The word \"girl\" originally meant \"young person of either sex\" in English; it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a \"female\" child. The term \"girl\" is sometimes used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman; however, during the early 1970s, feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. In particular, previously common terms such as \"office girl\" are no longer widely used. Conversely, in certain cultures which link family honor with female virginity, the word \"girl\" (or its equivalent in other languages) is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the more-or-less obsolete English \"maid\" or \"maiden\".\n\nThere are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term \"womanhood\" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the menarche; \"femininity\" is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to gender roles; \"womanliness\" is like \"femininity\", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles; \"femaleness\" is a general term, but is often used as shorthand for \"human femaleness\"; \"distaff\" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate archaism; \"muliebrity\" is a neologism (derived from the Latin) meant to provide a female counterpart of \"virility\", but used very loosely, sometimes to mean merely \"womanhood\", sometimes \"femininity\" and sometimes even as a collective term for women.\n\nMenarche, the onset of menstruation, occurs on average at age 12–13. Many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a girl's coming of age, such as confirmation in some branches of Christianity, bat mitzvah in Judaism, or even just the custom of a special celebration for a certain birthday (generally between 12 and 21), like the quinceañera of Latin America.\n\nThe earliest women whose names are known through archaeology include:\n\nIn terms of biology, the female sex organs are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the secondary sex characteristics are involved in nurturing children or, in some cultures, attracting a mate. The ovaries, in addition to their regulatory function producing hormones, produce female gametes called eggs which, when fertilized by male gametes (sperm), form new genetic individuals. The uterus is an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and muscle to expel it when giving birth. The vagina is used in copulation and birthing, although the term vagina is often colloquially and incorrectly used in the English language for the vulva or external female genitalia, which consists of (in addition to the vagina) the labia, the clitoris, and the female urethra. The breast evolved from the sweat gland to produce milk, a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of mammals, along with live birth. In mature women, the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals; this prominence, not necessary for milk production, is probably at least partially the result of sexual selection. (For other ways in which men commonly differ physically from women, see man.)\n\nDuring early fetal development, embryos of both sexes appear gender-neutral. As in cases without two sexes, such as species that reproduce asexually, the gender-neutral appearance is closer to female than to male. A fetus usually develops into a male if it is exposed to a significant amount of testosterone (typically because the fetus has a Y chromosome from the father). Otherwise, the fetus usually develops into a female, typically when the fetus has an X chromosome from the father, but also when the father contributed neither an X nor Y chromosome. Later at puberty, estrogen feminizes a young woman, giving her adult sexual characteristics.\n\nAn imbalance of maternal hormonal levels and some chemicals (or drugs) may alter the secondary sexual characteristics of fetuses. Most women have the karyotype 46,XX, but around one in a thousand will be 47,XXX, and one in 2500 will be 45,X. This contrasts with the typical male karotype of 46,XY; thus, the X and Y chromosomes are known as female and male, respectively. Because humans inherit mitochondrial DNA only from the mother's ovum, genetic studies of the female line tend to focus on mitochondrial DNA.\n\nWhether or not a child is considered female does not always determine whether or not the child later will identify themselves that way (see gender identity). For instance, intersex individuals, who have mixed physical and/or genetic features, may use other criteria in making a clear determination. At birth, babies may be assigned a gender based on their genitalia. In some cases, even if a child had XX chromosomes, if they were born with a penis, they were raised as a male. There are also trans women who were assigned as male at birth, but identify as women; there are varying social, legal, and individual definitions with regard to these issues.\nAlthough fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), because of a longer life expectancy there are only 81 men aged 60 or over for every 100 women of the same age. Women typically have a longer life expectancy than men. This is due to a combination of factors: genetics (redundant and varied genes present on sex chromosomes in women); sociology (such as the fact that women are not expected in most modern nations to perform military service); health-impacting choices (such as suicide or the use of cigarettes, and alcohol); the presence of the female hormone estrogen, which has a cardioprotective effect in premenopausal women; and the effect of high levels of androgens in men. Out of the total human population in 2015, there were 101.8 men for every 100 women.\n\nGirls' bodies undergo gradual changes during puberty, analogous to but distinct from those experienced by boys. Puberty is the process of physical changes by which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilisation. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads-either the ovaries or the testes. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sexual organs. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal, physical differences between boys and girls are the genitalia, the penis and the vagina. Puberty is a process that usually takes place between the ages 10–16, but these ages differ from girl to girl. The major landmark of girls' puberty is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12–13.\n\nMost girls go through menarche and are then able to become pregnant and bear children. This generally requires internal fertilization of her eggs with the sperm of a man through sexual intercourse, though artificial insemination or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see reproductive technology). The study of female reproduction and reproductive organs is called gynaecology.\n\nWomen's health refers to health issues specific to human female anatomy. There are some diseases that primarily affect women, such as lupus. Also, there are some sex-related illnesses that are found more frequently or exclusively in women, e.g., breast cancer, cervical cancer, or ovarian cancer. Women and men may have different symptoms of an illness and may also respond to medical treatment differently. This area of medical research is studied by gender-based medicine.\n\nThe issue of women's health has been taken up by many feminists, especially where reproductive health is concerned. Women's health is positioned within a wider body of knowledge cited by, amongst others, the World Health Organization, which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health.\n\nMaternal mortality or maternal death is defined by WHO as \"the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.\" About 99% of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. More than half of them occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third in South Asia. The main causes of maternal mortality are severe bleeding (mostly bleeding after childbirth), infections (usually after childbirth), pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, unsafe abortion, and pregnancy complications from malaria and HIV/AIDS. Most European countries, Australia, as well as Japan and Singapore are very safe in regard to childbirth, while Sub-Saharan countries are the most dangerous.\n\nReproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics has stated that:\n\nViolations of reproductive rights include forced pregnancy, forced sterilization and forced abortion.\n\nForced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many Western countries. Forced sterilization and forced abortion are reported to be currently practiced in countries such as Uzbekistan and China.\n\nThe lack of adequate laws on sexual violence combined with the lack of access to contraception and/or abortion are a cause of enforced pregnancy (see pregnancy from rape).\n\nIn many prehistoric cultures, women assumed a particular cultural role. In hunter-gatherer societies, women were generally the gatherers of plant foods, small animal foods and fish, while men hunted meat from large animals.\n\nIn more recent history, gender roles have changed greatly. Originally, starting at a young age, aspirations occupationally are typically veered towards specific directions according to gender. Traditionally, middle class women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care. For poorer women, especially working class women, although this often remained an ideal, economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home. Many of the occupations that were available to them were lower in pay than those available to men.\n\nAs changes in the labor market for women came about, availability of employment changed from only \"dirty\", long hour factory jobs to \"cleaner\", more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded, women's participation in the U.S. labor force rose from 6% in 1900 to 23% in 1923. These shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes of women at work, allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented.\n\nIn the 1970s, many female academics, including scientists, avoided having children. However, throughout the 1980s, institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace. Even so, the inequalities at home stumped women's opportunities to succeed as far as men. Professional women are still generally considered responsible for domestic labor and child care. As people would say, they have a \"double burden\" which does not allow them the time and energy to succeed in their careers. Furthermore, though there has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men, a recent research study showed that women focused on issues of morality, fairness, and well-being, while men focused on social conventions. Until the early 20th century, U.S. women's colleges required their women faculty members to remain single, on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once. According to Schiebinger, \"Being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career.\" (p. 93).\n\nMovements advocate equality of opportunity for both sexes and equal rights irrespective of gender. Through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement, in recent decades women in many societies now have access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker. \n\nAlthough a greater number of women are seeking higher education, their salaries are often less than those of men. CBS News claimed in 2005 that in the United States women who are ages 30 to 44 and hold a university degree make 62 percent of what similarly qualified men do, a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available. Some Western nations with greater inequity in pay are Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.\n\nThe UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women defines \"violence against women\" as:\n\nand identifies three forms of such violence: that which occurs \"in the family\", that which occurs \"within the general community\", and that which is perpetrated or condoned \"by the State\". It also states that \"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women\".\n\nViolence against women remains a widespread problem, fueled, especially outside the West, by patriarchal social values, lack of adequate laws, and lack of enforcement of existing laws. Social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress towards protecting women from violence. For example, according to surveys by UNICEF, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, and 80% in the Central African Republic. A 2010 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that stoning as a punishment for adultery was supported by 82% of respondents in Egypt and Pakistan, 70% in Jordan, 56% Nigeria, and 42% in Indonesia.\n\nSpecific forms of violence that affect women include female genital mutilation, sex trafficking, forced prostitution, forced marriage, rape, sexual harassment, honor killings, acid throwing, and dowry related violence. Governments can be complicit in violence against women, for instance through practices such as stoning (as punishment for adultery).\n\nThere have also been many forms of violence against women which have been prevalent historically, notably the burning of witches, the sacrifice of widows (such as sati) and foot binding. The prosecution of women accused of witchcraft has a long tradition, for example witch trials in the early modern period (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, rural North India, and Papua New Guinea) where belief in witchcraft is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence. In addition, there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft. In Saudi Arabia, witchcraft remains a crime punishable by death, and in 2011 the country beheaded a woman for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.\n\nIt is also the case that certain forms of violence against women have been recognized as criminal offenses only during recent decades, and are not universally prohibited, in that many countries continue to allow them. This is especially the case with marital rape. In the Western World, there has been a trend towards ensuring gender equality within marriage and prosecuting domestic violence, but in many parts of the world women still lose significant legal rights when entering a marriage.\n\nSexual violence against women greatly increases during times of war and armed conflict, during military occupation, or ethnic conflicts; most often in the form of war rape and sexual slavery. Contemporary examples of sexual violence during war include rape during the Armenian Genocide, rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War, rape in the Bosnian War, rape during the Rwandan genocide, and rape during Second Congo War. In Colombia, the armed conflict has also resulted in increased sexual violence against women. The most recent case was the Sexual jihad done by ISIL where 5000–7000 Yazidi and Christian girls and children were sold into Sexual slavery during the genocide and rape of Yazidi and Christian women, some of which jumped to their death from Mount Sinjar, as described in a witness statement.\n\nLaws and policies on violence against women vary by jurisdiction. In the European Union, sexual harassment and human trafficking are subject to directives.\n\nWomen in different parts of the world dress in different ways, with their choices of clothing being influenced by local culture, religious tenets traditions, social norms, and fashion trends, amongst other factors. Different societies have different ideas about modesty. However, in many jurisdictions, women's choices in regard to dress are not always free, with laws limiting what they may or may not wear. This is especially the case in regard to Islamic dress. While certain jurisdictions legally mandate such clothing (the wearing of the headscarf), other countries forbid or restrict the wearing of certain hijab attire (such as burqa/covering the face) in public places (one such country is France – see French ban on face covering). These laws are highly controversial.\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) – the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime — differs significantly between different regions of the world. In 2016, the highest estimated TFR was in Niger (6.62 children born per woman) and the lowest in Singapore (0.82 children/woman). While most Sub-Saharan African countries have a high TFR, which creates problems due to lack of resources and contributes to overpopulation, most Western countries currently experience a sub replacement fertility rate which may lead to population ageing and population decline.\n\nIn many parts of the world, there has been a change in family structure over the past few decades. For instance, in the West, there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the extended family to those which only consist of the nuclear family. There has also been a trend to move from marital fertility to non-marital fertility. Children born outside marriage may be born to cohabiting couples or to single women. While births outside marriage are common and fully accepted in some parts of the world, in other places they are highly stigmatized, with unmarried mothers facing ostracism, including violence from family members, and in extreme cases even honor killings. In addition, sex outside marriage remains illegal in many countries (such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen).\n\nThe social role of the mother differs between cultures. In many parts of the world, women with dependent children are expected to stay at home and dedicate all their energy to child raising, while in other places mothers most often return to paid work (see working mother and stay-at-home mother).\n\nParticular religious doctrines have specific stipulations relating to gender roles, social and private interaction between the sexes, appropriate dressing attire for women, and various other issues affecting women and their position in society. In many countries, these religious teachings influence the criminal law, or the family law of those jurisdictions (see Sharia law, for example). The relation between religion, law and gender equality has been discussed by international organizations.\n\nFemale education includes areas of gender equality and access to education, and its connection to the alleviation of poverty. Also involved are the issues of single-sex education and religious education in that the division of education along gender lines as well as religious teachings on education have been traditionally dominant and are still highly relevant in contemporary discussions of educating females as a global consideration.\n\nWhile the feminist movement has certainly promoted the importance of the issues attached to female education the discussion is wide-ranging and by no means narrowly defined. It may include, for example, HIV/AIDS education. Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries. In some Western countries, women have surpassed men at many levels of education. For example, in the United States in 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60% of master's degrees, and 50% of doctorates.\n\nWorld literacy is lower for females than for males. The CIA World Factbook presents an estimate from 2010 which shows that 80% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). Literacy rates are lowest in South and West Asia, and in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe educational gender gap in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years. Younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification: in 19 of the 30 OECD countries, more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64. In 21 of 27 OECD countries with comparable data, the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men. 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age.\nWhile women account for more than half of university graduates in several OECD countries, they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields, and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most OECD countries.\n\nThere is a common misconception that women have still not advanced in achieving academic degrees. According to Margaret Rossiter, a [[historian]] of science, women now earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States. However, although there are more women holding bachelor's degrees than men, as the level of education increases, the more men tend to fit the statistics instead of women. At the [[Postgraduate education|graduate level]], women fill 40 percent of the [[doctorate]] degrees (31 percent of them being in engineering).\n\nWhile to this day women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men, they are not being given the same chance to join faculty. Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is, the more difficult and time-consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there. In 1989, Harvard University tenured its first woman in chemistry, Cynthia Friend, and in 1992 its first woman in physics, Melissa Franklin. She also observed that women were more likely to hold their first [[professional]] positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions. According to Smith and Tang, as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions and only 29 percent of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women.\n\nIn 1992, women earned 9 percent of the PhDs awarded in [[engineering]], but only one percent of those women became professors. In 1995, 11 percent of professors in science and engineering were women. In relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1 percent of the total. Even in [[psychology]], a degree in which women earn the majority of PhDs, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19 percent in 1994.\n\n[[File:Map3.8Government Participation by Women compressed.jpg|left|thumb|A world map showing female governmental participation by country, 2010|alt=A world map showing female governmental participation by country, 2010.]]\n[[File:Angela Merkel (2008).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angela Merkel]] has earned the top spot on the \"FORBES\" list of Most Powerful Women In The World for eight of the past 10 years]]\n\nWomen are underrepresented in government in most countries. In October 2013, the global average of women in national assemblies was 22%. [[Suffrage]] is the civil right to [[vote]]. [[Women's suffrage in the United States]] was achieved gradually, first at state and local levels, starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and in 1920 women in the US received universal suffrage, with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Some Western countries were slow to allow women to vote; notably [[Switzerland]], where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]]; and [[Liechtenstein]], in 1984, through [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|a women's suffrage referendum]].\n\n[[File:Clara Schumann 1878.jpg|thumb|upright|German composer [[Clara Schumann]] in 1878]]\n\nWomen have, throughout history, made contributions to science, [[literature]] and [[art]]. One area where women have been permitted most access historically was that of [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] (prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was undertaken by women; from the mid 18th century onwards medical monitoring of pregnant women started to require rigorous formal education, to which women did not generally have access, therefore the practice was largely transferred to men).\n\nWriting was generally also considered acceptable for upper class women, although achieving success as a female writer in a male dominated world could be very difficult; as a result several women writers adopted a male pen name (e.g. [[George Sand]], [[George Eliot]]).\n\nWomen have been [[composer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], [[singer]]s, [[Conducting|conductors]], [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. There are music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and [[classical music]] singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women [[record producer]]s, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the \"Concise Oxford History of Music\", [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.\n\nWomen comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres. Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] \"... to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.\"\n\nAccording to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's \"[[The Independent]]\", women musicians in classical music are \"... too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent\" and they face pressure \"... to look sexy onstage and in photos.\" Duchen states that while \"[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks, ... the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.\"\n\nAccording to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the classical music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]]. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[music producer]]s, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.\n\n\nMedical:\n\nDynamics:\n\nPolitical:\n\nExploration:\n\n\n\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Women| ]]"}
