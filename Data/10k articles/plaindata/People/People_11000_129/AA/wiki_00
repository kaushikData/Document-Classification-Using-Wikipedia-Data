As Law Minister, he is credited as a principal draftsman of the Constitution of Pakistan, passed in 1973.\n\nTrained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn, Pirzada was a founding member of the Pakistan People's Party. He was elected to the National Assembly in the elections of 1970, holding several ministerial portfolios in the Bhutto government. After the government was deposed by General Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, Pirzada unsuccessfully assisted with Bhutto's defence in his criminal trial for murder. He briefly led the PPP before being imprisoned by the Zia regime, eventually leaving the party over differences with Benazir Bhutto, and retiring from politics.\n\nReturning to private practice, Pirzada rose to Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, becoming one of the country's leading lawyers. He died of medical complications in Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on 1 September 2015. He is cited as the 'Father of the Pakistani Constitution'.\n\nBorn in Sukkur, Sindh, British India, Abdul Hafeez Pirzada belonged to a prominent Sindhi family, the son of former Chief Minister of Sindh Pirzada Abdus Sattar. His family remains active in politics: his brother Abdul Mujeeb is a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (F).\n\nPirzada obtained his LLB degree from Karachi University, before gaining his LLM from Sindh University. He was also awarded an MSc. in Political Science from the university, after focusing his thesis on the Soviet Union and the rise of communism. He then trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, as his father and grandfather had.\n\nPirzada began his legal career at the Sindh High Court, known then as the West Pakistan High Court. He first met fellow lawyer Zulfikar Ali Bhutto when both were associates at Dingomal Ramchandani's law chambers in Karachi.\n\nPirzada was one of 30 members that co-founded the Pakistan People's Party on 30 November 1967, led by Bhutto. As Bhutto's legal counsel in cases instituted by the military regime of Ayub Khan, Pirzada successfully defended the cases, and rose to play a greater role in the party.\n\nIn the general elections of 1970, Pirzada was elected a Member of the National Assembly from Malir, polling 64,000 votes. After Bhutto was handed the presidency in 1971, he sacked incumbent Minister for Information Roedad Khan, appointing Pirzada instead. Pirzada also gained the Ministry of Education a year later.\n\nIn 1973, Pirzada assumed the control of the Ministry of Law and Justice, after Mahmud Ali Kasuri resigned from the post over differences with Bhutto. Pirzada played an integral role in the drafting, and ultimate passing of the Constitution of 1973.\n\nIn 1977, Pirzada was made Finance Minister. Elected an MNA again in 1977, Pirzada was a key member of the three-member government team that negotiated, unsuccessfully, a deal with the PNA opposition grouping. During that time, he was the Finance Minister of Pakistan for a little over three months, before the PPP-led government was overthrown by military coup by (see \"Fair Play\") General Zia-ul-Haq, then-Chief of Army Staff.\n\nOn 17 September 1977, Pirzada, along with Dr. Hassan and Bhutto, was arrested by the Military Police, but was released in 1978. Upon his release, Pirzada filed a petition in the Supreme Court requesting to review the petition. He then also filed a petition for the release of Dr. Mubashir Hassan but the petition was denied as the Military Police were holding Dr. Hassan on unknown criminal charges.\n\nOn 24 February, the Supreme Court denied the request of review, and so the court upheld its original decision. Pirzada then attempted to attain a commutation of Bhutto's sentence on the basis of split decision. This time, the Court decided to hear the arguments. On 28 February, the Army banned all the college text books of Dr. Hassan and forcefully lifted the books from major bookstores. On 12 March, the Supreme Court started to review the petition, and did so for the next 12 days. On 24 March, Pirzada informed Bhutto in jail that the President of Pakistan was able to change a death sentence into one of life imprisonment. Undaunted, Pirzada filed a petition to President General Zia-ul-Haq, who was serving at the time as Chief Martial Law Administrator. Pirzada asked the President to use \"Section 45 of the Constitution\", to commute the sentence to one of life imprisonment. However, General Zia-ul-Haq denied the application, saying the application had gone missing. Pirzada immediately went to meet Bhutto in his cell where he notified Bhutto about the application's status. After that, Pirzada held a press conference and told the media that Bhutto was prepared for death and would not file another application for mercy.\n\nOn 1 October 1982, Pirzada was arrested for demonstrating against Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization, where he also demanded the citizen basic rights. Following the ouster of the PPP Government and the imposition of martial law by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Pirzada developed differences with Nusrat and Benazir Bhutto. During the military rule in Pakistan he remained in exile in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn his return to Pakistan in the late 1980s, Pirzada withdrew from active politics and fully concentrated on his legal career. Pirzada was one of the most successful advocates in Pakistan.\n\nOn September 1, 2015, Pirzada died in Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, United Kingdom. He was buried in Sukkur, the Pirzada family's ancestral homeland.\n"}

Due to the character's appearance, he was initially described as female by video game sources. When they became aware of his sex, reviewers included Bridget on lists of best androgynous and cross-dressing characters, as well as debated his sexual orientation. Bridget has become a popular character among gamers, and critics have described him as \"a memorable character\" in the series.\n\nIshiwatari created Bridget as \"a cute character\" and to vary the games' cast, since \"there were already other good looking and tough characters\". As many fighting games already had this type of character, and \"it would be too boring if the character was just cute\", Ishiwatari \"wanted something unconventional\"; he and his staff decided it \"would be interesting to make the character a guy.\"\n\nThe series' creator also said that Bridget was a difficult character to animate; he \"has double the frames of animation\" due to his yo-yo movements. He spent \"a very long, very frustrating time trying to get the animation to work\", rejecting many versions before studio staff made Bridget \"look natural\".\n\nBridget was introduced in the third installment of the series, \"Guilty Gear X2\" (2002), and appears to be a girl since he wears a nun's habit. However, according to his backstory Bridget is a boy, one of twin brothers named and raised by his parents as a girl in a British village. They do this to protect him, since the villagers believe that identical twins bring bad luck. As Bridget grows up, he is determined to prove he is not unlucky and becomes a bounty hunter who fights with a yo-yo and , his mechanical, oversized teddy bear. His journey begins when I-No gives him a fake bounty list. In \"Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus\" (2008), since Bridget feels he has proven his masculinity by defeating several opponents he decides to become an entertainer. Although he tries to recruit Venom for his talent at pool and I-No for her ability to play electric guitar, both refuse his suggestion. Without money, in one ending Bridget works as a waiter in Jam Kuradoberi's restaurant. In an alternate ending he returns to his birth village, finds that his twin brother has disappeared and begins searching for him.\n\nBridget is also a playable character in the spin-offs \"Guilty Gear Isuka\" (2004), \"Dust Strikers\" (2006), and \"Judgment\" (2006).\n\nIn a 2013 poll conducted by Arc System Works, Bridget was voted as the most popular character from the series. Eurogamer called Bridget as \"[o]ne of \"Guilty Gear\"s more memorable characters\", while Kotaku's Brian Ashcraft said \"[h]e's not only one of \"Guilty Gear\"s most memorable characters [...] but also one of gaming's\", calling him \"an iconic character\". UGO Networks named Bridget one of \"Craziest Fighting Game Characters\" as despite being a boy, he looks like \"just a hot chick in a nun's costume that fights with a yo-yo\". His nun's habit was featured on \"NowGamer\"s 2010 list of \"Gaming's Most Inappropriate Outfits Ever\". Likewise, Virgin Media and 1UP.com placed him among the \"worst-dressed games characters ever\"; the latter stated \"it's like gaming's version of \"The Crying Game\"—but with more crying.\"\n\nBridget was described as a woman in early reports, and has been the subject of discussion about his gender identity. IGN first described Bridget as a \"kooky cross-dressing yoyo-wielding nun character\", while GamesRadar called him \"a saucy Catholic nun with a penis\". GamesRadar placed Bridget second on its list of \"Top 7... 'That's a Dude!?'\", commenting that Bridget want to be manlier, \"but unfortunately, none of them include not dressing as a sex-starved lady of the cloth.\" UGO agreed; they ranked him the 21st-most-androgynous game character, saying \"[h]e doesn't do too much to combat the image, either, fighting with weapons like a yo-yo and an oversized teddy bear.\" He ranked fourth on ZoominGames' Top 5 \"Transsexual characters in games\", and UGO listed him among the \"Best Crossdressers\" in all media. Further, \"The Escapist\" noted that Bridget is the first transgender, cross-dressing character who is a protagonist, although such statements are erroneous, as Bridget is neither transsexual nor transgender.\n\nSince Bridget is a boy who was raised as a girl, his sexuality has been questioned. Although his sexual orientation is undisclosed, several websites have included the character in LGBT-related articles. On other hand, Destructoid featured an article \"to argue the heterosexuality of Bridget.\" Despite the controversy, GayGamer.net, JeuxvideoPC and Destructoid agree that Bridget is appreciated by fans; on the Internet, pictures of the character appear with captions such as \"Bridget made me gay\" and \"Everyone is gay for Bridget\". This was cited by GamesRadar's staff, which listed him among \"characters we'd go gay for\". When John McCain sponsored a bill which would require ISPs and possibly websites to alert the government about illegal images of minors—including cartoons—\"Wired\" published an article entitled \"McCain Not Gay For Bridget\".\n\nGamasutra's Zoran Iovanovici ascribed Bridget's popularity to the fact that he is \"ultra feminized\", adding that \"[i]t's no surprise that Bridget has become a fan favorite over the years.\" Stephen Kelley wrote on VG Chartz that Bridget \"appears to be a \"moe\" style cute anime character\", but \"[d]ressed in the provocative nun costume Bridget is suddenly a creepy sex object.\" Pride St. Clair posted on the \"Piki Geek\" blog that Bridget \"seemed to be playing towards several prevalent anime fetishes, including the innocent girl and the religious figure who is at once both desirable and chaste\", saying that despite seeming \"designed as a trap ... Bridget is a sort of touchstone, a basis for a productive discussion about the role gender and fetishism plays in fighting games and modern Japanese culture.\"\n"}
{"id": "1496773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1496773", "title": "Carlos Castaño Gil", "text": "Carlos Castaño Gil\n\nCarlos Castaño Gil (May 16, 1965 – April 16, 2004) was the founder of the Peasant Self-Defenders of Córdoba and Urabá (ACCU), a far-right paramilitary organization in Colombia. Castaño and his brothers Fidel and Vicente founded this group (and its previous incarnations) after their father was kidnapped and killed by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), in association with other enemies or victims of the guerrillas. The ACCU later became one of the founding members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).\n\nCarlos Castaño Gil was the youngest son of the family Castaño Gil, which mainly raised livestock. Like his brothers, he experienced firsthand the murder of his father and Jesus Castaño. Led by his older brother Fidel, he became a member of self-defense groups, which were among the first of their kind.\n\nHe was introduced to Medellin Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar by his brother Fidel, and their friendship became close. Castaño received combat training from his brother, from army officers and employees of the paramilitary group as well as from the Israeli mercenary Yair Klein.\n\nCastaño opposed financing paramilitary groups through drug trafficking. The friendship between the Castaño brothers and Pablo Escobar broke when the latter sent assassins against the Castaño while being detained inside his personal prison \"La Catedral\". Castaño and his brothers then became founders of the group \"Los Pepes\" (an acronym for \"people persecuted by Pablo Escobar\"). During this time Carlos was known by the aliases of \"the Phantom\" or \"the Kid\". Contacts between Los Pepes and the Colombian National Police Search Bloc allegedly resulted in Escobar's demise and killing.\n\nTwo months after the death of Escobar, Fidel Castaño was killed in a battle against the EPL guerrilla. However, it is believed that Carlos may have had a role in Fidel's death in retaliation for the alleged rape and murder (or possible suicide) of Rumalda Castaño, a woman alleged to have been a lover of both brothers. After Fidel's death, Carlos Castaño assumed leadership of AUC, a paramilitary federation.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with writer Robin Kirk, later published in \"More Terrible Than Death: Massacres, Drugs and America's War in Colombia\" (PublicAffairs: New York, 2003), Castaño acknowledged that the men under his command committed \"excesses\", but defended them as necessary in Colombia's conflict. \"Look, the guerrillas hide themselves within the civilian population, they manipulate the population\". In a September 1997 interview in \"El Tiempo\" newspaper, Castaño admitted responsibility for the Mapiripán massacre.\n\nIn 1997, Castaño later founded an umbrella organization of paramilitaries operating in Colombia known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). The AUC demobilized in 2006 admitting to several brutal murders to the Colombian population. The AUC was accused by human rights organizations of committing atrocities, and it has openly admitted to its involvement in the drug trade. The AUC was listed by the US Department of State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. AUC was disbanded after then Colombian President Alvaro Uribe Vélez reached a peace agreement with reduced terms for its members.\n\nCastaño was convicted in absentia of the murder of journalist Jaime Garzón, and sentenced to 38 years in prison.\n\nOn September 24, 2002, the United States Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against Castaño which accused him of trafficking over 17 tons of cocaine into the United States. Castaño announced that he would give himself up for trial in the United States and would accept his participation in numerous crimes, though he resented his being personally linked to the drug trade.\n\nCastaño had become isolated from the organization according to some observers, as he seemed to become relatively critical of the AUC's increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and was more willing to compromise with the Colombian Government. Allegedly this caused some AUC commanders to turn their backs on him.\n\nCastaño stated on Colombian television in 2000 that 70 percent of AUC funds came from narcotrafficking.\n\nCastaño was killed on April 16, 2004. Acting AUC commanders claimed initially that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters.\n\nOther sources within the group and among its dissident factions claimed that he and his men were captured and tortured before being executed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother Vicente Castaño and Diego Murillo AKA \"Don Berna\"), who had become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Colombian investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Castaño's) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources alleged that the bodies of Castaño and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive.\n\nThe possible death of the AUC co-founder remained in the air and was the subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the rumours, dating from June 1, 2004, stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the AFP agency that Castaño may have been spirited away to either Israel or Egypt, via Panama, allegedly with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced and the parties allegedly involved separately denied their participation.\n\nSources from the AUC and other local militant factions continued to dispute the exact whereabouts of Carlos Castaño. His personal and financial connections between narcotraffickers and other sectors of society could have allowed for their possible collaboration in his conspicuous disappearance or murder. Despite these claims, the truth regarding Castaño's exact condition remained unknown.\n\nOn August 23, 2006, Colombia's Attorney General publicly ordered the capture of his brother Vicente Castaño and seven other individuals, accusing them of being involved in Carlos Castaño's apparent death. Alleged witnesses to the crime stated that Castaño's body was apparently dismembered and incinerated.\n\nCastaño's skeleton was recovered from a shallow grave on September 1, 2006, and identified through DNA testing by the Colombian government authorities. His brother's second lieutenant named Jesús Roldán AKA \"MonoLeche\", a former Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación) guerrilla who later joined the paramilitaries, confessed to his murder and led authorities to the grave.\n\nCastaño is portrayed by the actor Mauricio Mejía as the character of Adolfo Aguilar \"El Halcón\" in TV series \"El Cartel\", Mejía also portrays Castaño in the Netflix original television series \"Narcos\". David Noreña portrays Castaño as the character of Lucio Moreno in the TV series \"Escobar, el patrón del mal\". Castaño is also portrayed by the actor Julián Román in TV series \"Los Tres Caínes\".\n\n\n"}

() (23 April 1522 – 2 February 1590), was an Italian Dominican Tertiary sister. She is believed to have had miraculous visions and corporeal encounters with Jesus, both with the infant Jesus and with the adult Jesus. She is said to have spontaneously bled with the wounds of the crucified Christ. She is venerated for her mystic visions and is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church.\n\nShe was born Alessandra Lucrezia Romola de' Ricci in Florence to Pier Francesco de' Ricci, of a patrician family, and his wife, Caterina Bonza, who died soon after. At age 6 or 7, her father enrolled her in a school run by a monastery of Benedictine nuns in the Monticelli quarter of the city, near their home, where her aunt, Luisa de' Ricci, was the abbess. She was a very prayerful person from a very young age. There she developed a lifelong devotion to the Passion of Christ. After a short time outside the monastery she entered the Convent of St Vincent in Prato, Tuscany, a cloistered community of religious sisters of the Third Order of St. Dominic, disciples of the noted Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, who followed the strict regimen of life she desired. In May 1535 she received the religious habit from her uncle, Friar Timoteo de' Ricci, O.P., who was confessor to the convent, and the religious name of Catherine, after the Dominican tertiary, Catherine of Siena.\n\nDe' Ricci's period of novitiate was a time of trial. She would experience ecstasies during her routine, which caused her to seem asleep during community prayer services, dropping plates and food, so much so that the community began to question her competence, if not her sanity. Eventually the other Sisters became aware of the spiritual basis for her behavior. By the age of 30 she had risen to the post of prioress.\n\nShe is reported to have been a nun with visions, states Constance Classen, who miraculously held baby Jesus dressed in swaddling clothes, and was mystically married and united with adult Jesus.\n\nAs the prioress, De' Ricci developed into an effective and greatly admired administrator. She was an advisor on various topics to princes, bishops and cardinals. She corresponded with three figures who were destined to become popes: Pope Marcellus II, Pope Clement VIII, and Pope Leo XI. An expert on religion, management and administration, her advice was widely sought. She gave counsel both in person and through exchanging letters. It is reported that she was extremely effective and efficient in her work, managing her priorities very well.\n\nIt is claimed that De' Ricci's meditation on the Passion of Christ was so deep that she spontaneously bled, as if scourged. She also bore the Stigmata. During times of deep prayer, like Catherine of Siena, her patron saint, a coral ring representing her marriage to Christ, appeared on her finger.\n\nIt is reported that De' Ricci wore an iron chain around her neck, engaged in extreme fasting and other forms of penance and sacrifice, especially for souls in Purgatory.\n\nOne of the miracles that was documented for her canonization was her appearance many hundreds of miles away from where she was physically located. This involved appearing in a vision St Philip Neri, a resident of Rome, with whom she had maintained a long-term correspondence. Neri, who was otherwise very reluctant to discuss miraculous events, confirmed the event.\n\nDe' Ricci lived in the convent until her death in 1590 after a prolonged illness. Her remains are visible under the altar of the Minor Basilica of Santi Vicenzo e Caterina de' Ricci, Prato, which is next to the convent associated with her life.\n\nDe' Ricci was beatified by Pope Clement XII in 1732, and canonized by Pope Benedict XIV in 1746. Her feast day falls on 4 February.\n\n\n"}

Alternative meanings include \"angular, having corners\", \"swollen\", or \"possessing a dish or receptacle\".\n\nIn the destruction of Da Derga's Hostel, Conall Cernach is described as follows:\n\n\"I saw a man there in an ornamented dining compartment, who was the fairest of the warriors of Ireland. A fleecy crimson cloak about him. As white as the snow one of the cheeks on him, as freckled-red as the foxglove the other cheek. One of his two eyes is as blue as a hyacinth, as black as a beetle’s back the other eye. The measure of a reaping basket his bushy tree (of) fair, very blond (hair) that is on him. It strikes the edge of his two hips. It is as fleecy as a tufted ram. Though a sack of bountiful (?) red nuts were poured out over the top of his head, not a nut of them would fall to the ground. A goldhilted sword in his hand. A blood-red shield, dotted with rivets of white metal (tincopper alloy) between plates of gold. A long, three-ridged spear, as thick as an outer yoke (of a miller’s team?) the shaft that is on it.\"\n\nHis father was Amairgin mac Echit and his mother was Findchoem. His parents' marriage was barren, until Findchoem visited a druid and was advised to drink from a certain well. She took a drink from the well, swallowing a worm with it, and became pregnant. Findchoem's brother Cet mac Mágach, a Connachtman, protected his sister until she gave birth to a son, Conall. Druids came to initiate the child into their religion, and prophesied that he would kill more than half of the men of Connacht, and that he would always have a Connachtman's head on his belt. Cet took the child, put him under his heel and tried to break his neck, but only damaged it, leaving Conall with a crooked neck.\n\nConall would have a fierce rivalry with Cet for the rest of his life. He shamed Cet at a feast at the house of Mac Dá Thó, a hospitaller of Leinster, when the warriors of Connacht and Ulster competed for the champion's portion by boasting of their deeds. Cet reminded all comers how he had bested them in combat, including emasculating Celtchar with his spear. However, just as Cet was about to carve, Conall arrived, and his boasts topped even Cet's. Cet admitted defeat, but claimed that if his brother Anlúan were present, his feats would top even Conall's. Conall responded by tossing him Anlúan's freshly severed head.\n\nHe also competed for the champion's portion at a feast held by the troublemaker Bricriu, albeit with less success. Bricriu went in turn to Conall, Lóegaire Búadach and Cúchulainn, and promised each of them the champion's portion. When the feast started each of the three warriors' charioteers stood up and claimed the champion's portion for his master. A fight broke out between Conall, Láegare and Cúchulainn, until King Conchobar, Fergus and Sencha intervened to separate them. Meanwhile, Bricriu went to each of the three heroes' wives - Conall's wife Lendabair, Lóegaire's wife Fedelm, and Cúchulainn's wife Emer - and promised them precedence at the feast, and when the women approached, Conall, Lóegaire and Cúchulainn were almost set to violence again. Emer was the first to enter, as Cúchulainn lifted the side of the house up to let her in, tipping Bricriu into a ditch. The Ulstermen asked first Ailill and Medb, king and queen of Connacht, then Cú Roí, king of Munster, to adjudicate the dispute. In every test set, Cúchulainn came out on top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire would accept the result. Finally, a hideous, giant churl, carrying a huge axe, appeared at Emain Macha. He challenged each of the three heroes to cut off his head, and then allow him to return the next day to cut off the hero's head. Lóegaire accepted the challenge and cut off the churl's head, and the churl picked up his head and left. He returned the next day, but Lóegaire was nowhere to be seen. Conall was the next to take up the challenge, but he too did not fulfil his side of the bargain. Finally Cúchulainn cut off the churl's head, and submitted himself to the churl's axe the following day as promised. The churl spared him, revealed himself as Cú Roí, and declared that Cúchulainn should have the champion's portion undisputed at any feast held by the Ulstermen.\n\nHe helped the Connacht hero Fráech recover his abducted wife and sons and stolen cattle. They tracked them to Alba (Scotland), southwards through Britain, across the English Channel, through Lombardy, to the Alps, where they met an Irish girl herding sheep. She told them the land was ruled by warriors who stole cattle from far and near, and had recently brought back Fráech's cattle and family. She advised them to go to the woman who tended the cows, who warned them that the fort where Fráech's wife was kept was guarded by a serpent, but promised to leave the gate open for them. When they attacked the fort, the serpent leaped into Conall's belt, and did him no harm. They liberated Fráech's family, took all the cattle and treasure, and went back to Ireland the way they came.\n\nHe fought Mes Gedra, king of Leinster, in single combat following a battle provoked by the Ulster poet Athirne. Mes Gedra had lost a hand in an earlier fight, so Conall fought him with one hand tucked into his belt. He won, taking his opponent's head as a trophy. When he put Mes Gedra's head on his shoulder, it straightened his neck. Conall's charioteer couldn't carry the head, so he cut out the brain and preserved it by mixing it with lime. The calcified brain was later stolen by Cet and used to kill Conchobar mac Nessa.\n\nConall and Cúchulainn had sworn to each other that whoever was killed first, the other would avenge him before nightfall. When Lugaid mac Con Roí and Erc mac Cairpri killed Cúchulainn, Conall pursued them. Lugaid had also lost a hand, and Conall again fought one-handed, but this time he only won after his horse took a bite out of Lugaid's side. He took both their heads, and when he took Erc's head back to Tara his sister, Achall, died of grief.\n\nConall pursued Cet after he had made a raid on Ulster, killing twenty-seven men and taking their heads. It had snowed, so he was able to follow his trail. He caught up with him, but was reluctant to face him until his charioteer chided him for cowardice. They met at a ford, and Conall killed Cet in a ferocious combat that left Conall near to death himself. He was found by Bélchú of Breifne, a Connachtman, who took him home, tended to his wounds, and planned to fight him when he was fit. But Bélchú soon regretted his honourable behaviour and asked his three sons to kill Conall as he lay in his sickbed. Conall overheard and forced Bélchú to take his place in the bed, and when his sons arrived they killed him instead. Conall then killed the three of them and took all four heads home.\n\nAfter Conchobor and his son, Cormac Cond Longas, had been killed, Conall was offered the kingship of Ulster, but he refused it, putting forward instead his foster-son, Conchobar's younger son Cúscraid, who was proclaimed king. In his declining years he contracted leprosy and went to stay with Ailill and Medb of Connacht, who were best placed to look after him, since they had the resources to satisfy his enormous appetite. Ailill was seeing another woman behind Medb's back, so Medb incited Conall to kill Ailill, something he was happy to do as Ailill had killed Fergus mac Róich. Ailill was killed on 1 May, Lá Bealtaine, which was on a Tuesday. Conall fled, but the men of Connacht pursued and killed him at a ford on the following Monday, 7 May. Both oral tradition and old textual sources place this at the town of Ballyconnell, County Cavan.\n\nConall's wife was Lendabair, daughter of Eogain mac Durthacht. He also had other wives, including 1. Aifi, daughter of Bélcu Bréifne whom Conall had slain; 2. Niamh, daughter of Cealtair; 3. Feibe, daughter of Concubur and her son by Conall was Fiaca Fir Feibe; 4. Fedelm Noíchrothach, daughter of Conchobar mac Nessa. She was also the wife of Cairbre Nia Fer, whom she left to go to Conall; 5. Londcaidhe, daughter of Eatach Eachbeoil. Her son by Conall was Irial Glunmar. Unusually for a character from the Ulster Cycle, Conall appears in medieval Irish genealogies as the ancestor of the kings of the Dál nAraidi and the Uí Echach Cobo. The legendary High King Mal mac Rochride was also said to be descended from him.\n\n"}

{"id": "2506940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2506940", "title": "David Xanatos", "text": "David Xanatos\n\nDavid Xanatos is a fictional character and one of the primary villains of the Disney animated television series \"Gargoyles\". In the series, he is the founder, owner and CEO of Xanatos Enterprises and a member of the Illuminati. Xanatos was voiced by (and his design inspired by) \"\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jonathan Frakes.\n\nXanatos' behavior is often ruthless and amoral, although his personality is slightly softened later in the series by his affection for his wife Fox and their infant son, Alexander Fox Xanatos. His plans are often intricate and Machiavellian — however, he is notably not vindictive as he sees revenge as foolish and even tends to try to see the positive side of his defeats. In fact, Xanatos is notorious for his intricate plans that often have multiple interplaying goals to endeavor that some beneficial result is achieved in one way or another, despite the frequent intervention of Goliath, Xanatos' arch-rival, and his clan of Gargoyles. He is obsessed with obtaining immortality for himself and his family. His loyal right-hand man is Owen Burnett, a stoic man with extraordinary hidden talents Xanatos gained through equally remarkable circumstances.\n\nXanatos is a formidable fighter in his own right. In addition to advanced karate and judo skills, he also has a specialized red armored suit modeled on his Steel Clan robots that he wears frequently, with both Xanatos' armored suit and Steel Clan robots appearing to be partly modeled on Goliath's general appearance and size. He also has a highly advanced anthropomorphic AI device modeled after himself, designed to do his bidding; it impersonates and represents him whenever he needs it to. This robot became the leader of the criminal group The Pack under the name of Coyote, and on one occasion, he actually used it to try to capture the actual Coyote spirit.\n\nDavid Xanatos started life as the son of Petros Xanatos, a Greek immigrant who worked a fisherman from Bar Harbor, Maine. Young Xanatos received an anonymous letter that contained a set of valuable 10th-century coins. He sold the coins for $20,000 and invested the money in a series of successful ventures, thus pulling himself out of poverty during the process. He would later embark on a business career, the first steps toward building his own company, Xanatos Enterprises, which includes the technology subsidiaries cybernetics and genetics company Gen-U-Tech and the Scarab Corporation robotics firm; the Xanatos construction company, and the television franchise Pack Media Studios. Another technology investment venture that Xanatos Enterprises has expanded into is the arms industry (such as the particle beam accelerators which Tony Dracon stole during the series). Xanatos Enterprises also controls the lease of an oil rig located near Black Rock Point. Despite his father's belief that Xanatos did not deserve the gift that had launched his career, Xanatos continued to claim that he would one day prove himself a self-made man.\n\nDuring this time, Xanatos took on Owen Burnett under his wing, a former employee of business rival Halcyon Renard, as his assistant. Eventually, Burnett revealed that he is actually Puck, a Child of Oberon, and offered Xanatos a tempting choice: a single wish (which could grant the immortality he sought) or a lifetime of service as the mortal Owen Burnett. Against Puck's expectations, Xanatos, confident that he could achieve immortality through other methods, chose Owen's service, and the decision deeply impressed Puck to keep his end of the bargain, with the inference that, should Xanatos achieve his goal, he will be guaranteed Puck/Owen's services for eternity.\n\nXanatos learned of Castle Wyvern from Demona, the only gargoyle from the Wyvern Clan who had neither been destroyed nor put into stone sleep. He purchased the ruins, transported them to Manhattan, and had the structure rebuilt atop his New York skyscraper, the Eyrie Building. With the castle \"above the clouds,\" Xanatos successfully released the Manhattan Clan from their frozen sleep.\n\nXanatos initially posed as the Gargoyles' friend, convincing them to \"acquire\" technology from his rival Cyberbiotics for him and ultimately attempting to destroy the gargoyles once their replacements, the Steel Clan, came online. The Steel Clan was defeated, however, and Xanatos was convicted for receiving stolen property (\"Awakening, Part V\"). Xanatos continued to plot against the Gargoyles from prison, testing them and attempting to remove them from the castle. Upon his release, he became one of their greatest enemies, engaging in a particularly fierce rivalry with their leader, Goliath.\n\nXanatos also committed himself to getting his own clan of gargoyles that would be loyal and obedient to him. To that end, he tried several attempts throughout the series to do that such as resurrecting Goliath's brother Coldstone and some of the other dead gargoyles from the Wyvern Clan; enlisting the services of a \"freelance geneticist\" named Dr. Anton Sevarius to craft unwitting human subjects towards genetically creating his own clan of gargoyle-like mutates from humans, one of whom was Elisa Maza's younger brother, Derek; creating a clone of Goliath, and perfecting the Steel Clan. It is also during this time he discovered the existence and joined the Illuminati.\n\nWhen his attempts to create his own gargoyle clan failed, Xanatos instead changed his goal to acquiring immortality through the use of sorcery and magic, even involving himself with children of Oberon, including Oberon himself — the formidable Lord of the mystical island of Avalon.\n\nXanatos would meet an equal in Fox and marry her. It was on this occasion that, by inviting Goliath to the wedding and luring him into seeking reconciliation with Demona, Xanatos was able to reconstruct the Phoenix Gate. The wedding party was brought back in time to the 10th century, where Xanatos arranged for the ancient coins to be delivered to himself a thousand years in the future, via Illuminati, as well as a message to himself describing what to do with them. In this way, Xanatos fulfilled his own history through a predestination paradox, at the same time proving himself to his father as a \"self-made man\" (\"Vows\").\n\nWhen Demona finally betrayed Xanatos to advance her own goals of destroying the human race, he was forced to call a truce with Goliath to stop her. Goliath was later instrumental in saving Xanatos's newborn son Alexander, something which Xanatos owed him a great debt, and pledged to pay back to him (\"The Gathering, Part II\"). He soon created new robotic bodies for Coldstone's other personalities to inhabit, which he named Coldfire and Coldsteel. Since these gargoyles were also created by magic, though, it was impossible for mind transfer to occur. While he and Fox were out to dinner, Puck and Alexander performed the transfer for him. When the existence of the gargoyles was revealed to the public, Xanatos puts an end to the feud between them and voluntarily allows the gargoyles to come back to live in their ancestral castle (\"Hunter's Moon, Part III\").\n\nThough at first Xanatos seems to have an on and off partnership with Demona when neither magic nor technology seem to be enough to accomplish what they plan to do, neither Xanatos nor Demona seem to truly trust one another. This proves to be a fatal flaw on their part, that tends to doom their future plans towards failure.\n\nIn general, Xanatos has an odd way of dealing with those he \"loves\". One example can be found in Thailog, Goliath's clone that he had Sevarius create. While the clone was being grown he had a program playing giving him information about the world and his beliefs. He seemed to have a paternal feeling towards Thailog as, when the gargoyle was kidnapped during his stone slumber, he would not let Owen fire on the kidnappers out of fear of hurting Thailog, and handed over $20,000,000 for his safe return without a second thought. He even showed pride in Thailog's manipulative abilities and genius when he found out the clone had engineered the entire plot to abscond with the money, referring to him as \"a chip off the ole block\". He even expressed to Thailog that if he wanted the money he would have given it to him if he would have asked for it. However his paternalism seems thin as, when he thinks Thailog died during battle with Goliath, he states that he knew the whole time that a copy (Thailog) couldn't match the original (Goliath), which infuriates Goliath as Xanatos was able to dehumanize a living being to such terms. Though arguably lacking romance, Xanatos asks Fox to marry him on the basis that \"it makes sense\" because they are genetically compatible, share the same interests, and \"love each other\" as much as two people such as themselves can.\n\nThough he does love Fox, he is shown using her to get what he wants as well. In the Halloween episode, Xanatos gives Fox the Avalon-crafted Eye of Odin as an engagement gift. The necklace holds unfathomable occult powers that Fox cannot control. It turns her into a large red-haired beast, looking like a 'fox'-human hybrid bearing a resemblance to a werewolf. Though Xanatos suspects it has an effect on her, he does not fully understand, until he witnesses Fox transform in front of him. Terrified by what he has set into motion, he asks Goliath and Elisa for assistance, though they are initially reluctant. Goliath seems especially perturbed at how he has treated Fox and seemingly disregarded her life.\n\nAs Fox continues to go on rampages in search for food, Xanatos, Goliath, and Elisa scour the city for her. Eventually, they chase her to a rooftop and Goliath is able to free Fox from the Eye of Odin after electrocuting her with a neon sign. While preparing to leave and while holding Fox in his arms, Xanatos regretfully informs Goliath that now he knows his only weakness. Goliath turns to him, slightly disgusted and remarks, \"Only you would regard love as a weakness.\" These words leave Xanatos speechless, but silently admits.\n\nIn the episodes of the Gathering, Xanatos seems instinctively protective of both Fox and Alexander, seemingly having come to terms with the idea of love not being a weakness.\n\nSoon after, Owen received a call from Mr. Duval from The Illuminati for Xanatos. Xanatos refused as he spent some time with his son that night. On Halloween Night, he's later visited by Martin Hacker (who ranks 32 in The Illuminati) who gives him an invitation to the White House. From there he meets another Illuminati member, Quincy Hemings (Chief Stewart at the White House who ranks 2 in The Illuminati). He hands Xanatos a mission from The Illuminati.\n\nThe mission is for him to obtain The Stone of Destiny which is being sent back to Scotland. To ensure success, he recruits Coldsteel and activates Coyote 5.0. He sends some Steel and Iron Clan robots to assist them.\n\nThe third season of Gargoyles was called \"The Goliath Chronicles\". In this season, Xanatos was portrayed as a benefactor to the Gargoyles. Greg Weisman, the main writer behind \"Gargoyles\", disagreed with how Xanatos is portrayed in the Goliath Chronicles. Weisman has stated that he believes that if the feud with the clan ended, Xanatos would still seek to achieve his own goals (as according to Greg will be demonstrated in #4 or 5 of the SLG series). This is acknowledged by Brooklyn and Goliath in #1 of the Slave Labor Graphics comic book series continuation that while he isn't 100% trustworthy, they trust him not to smash them during the day. In the Goliath Chronicles, Xanatos must deal with pressure from The Illuminati in terms of turning the clan over to them.\n"}
{"id": "771980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771980", "title": "Double-barrelled name", "text": "Double-barrelled name\n\nIn the Western tradition of surnames, there are several types of double surname (also double-barrelled surname). If the two names are joined with a hyphen, it may also be called a hyphenated surname.\n\n\nA few British upper-class families have \"triple-barrelled\" surnames (e.g. Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe; Cave-Browne-Cave; Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound; Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby; Smith-Dorrien-Smith; Vane-Tempest-Stewart). Not all of those with multiple names were of the peerage; landed gentry such as George Henry Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers consolidated the estates and wealth of several families in their multiple names. These are sometimes created when one spouse has a double-barrelled name and the other has a single surname. Nowadays, such names are almost always abbreviated in everyday use to a single or double-barrelled version. There are even a few \"quadruple-barrelled\" surnames (e.g. Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce, Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax and Stirling-Home-Drummond-Moray). The surname of the extinct family of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos was the quintuple-barrelled Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville.\n\nCaptain Leone Sextus Denys Oswolf Fraudatifilius Tollemache-Tollemache de Orellana Plantagenet Tollemache-Tollemache is sometimes quoted as the man with the most ever \"barrels\" in his surname (six), but in fact all but the last two of these (Tollemache-Tollemache) were forenames.\n\nMany double-barrelled names are written without a hyphen, which can cause confusion as to whether the surname is double-barrelled or not. Notable persons with unhyphenated double-barrelled names include prime minister David Lloyd George, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, astronomer Robert Hanbury Brown, actors Kristin Scott Thomas and Helena Bonham Carter (although she has said the hyphen is optional) comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (however, his cousin Professor Simon Baron-Cohen opted for the hyphen) and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.\n\nWhen a person is born, the custom is for them to take the first surname of the father and then the first surname of the mother. Thus, when D. Julio Iglesias de la Cueva and Dª Isabel Preysler Arrastía had a son called Enrique, he legally was Enrique Iglesias Preysler. Where the optional conjunction \"y\" (and) is used, the example would become \"Enrique Iglesias y Preysler\" (never used in the case of Enrique Iglesias; see for example José Ortega y Gasset). On the other hand, actual double-barrelled names exist (called \"apellidos compuestos\"), such as García-Huidobro, Cruz-Coke. For example, Luciano Cruz-Coke Carvallo is the son of Mr. Carlos Cruz-Coke Ossa and Ms. Lucía Carvallo Arriagada. In every day use Mr. Cruz-Coke Carvallo is Mr. Cruz-Coke, never Mr. Cruz. Such names usually reflect the same case as in Anglo-Saxon tradition: the survival of a family name that would be lost without this practice. \nAnother common case is to find double-barrelled names with the use of the conjunction \"de\" (of). In Iberian tradition this commonly indicates a toponymic surname or a noble family name. \nToponymic family such as the surnames García De las Heras, Pérez de Arce or the very common Ortiz de Zárate combine a regular family name with the place that family resides. For example, the \"Ortiz\" resides in the Basque town of Zarate, in Euskal Herria. \nThe least common double-barreled names that use the particle \"de\" are the nobiliary ones, such as the Álvarez de Toledo, Ramírez de Arellano or Fernández de Córdoba. In these cases, the first surname indicates the original name of the family, whereas the second surname denotes the nobiliary feud of that family. In this case, the conjunction \"de\" (of) reflects that the family used to be the feudal lords of that place. Thus, the Ramírez were the lords of the village of Arellano, in Navarre.\n\nÁlava, Spain is notorious for its incidence of true compound surnames, known as \"apellido compuesto alavés\" (Álava compound surname). Unlike other true compound surnames, which resulted from the merging of a previously paternal and maternal surname, the Álava compound surname is characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the Castilian language) or more unusually a Basque language patronymic, followed by the preposition \"de\", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from Álava. While this form of compound surname can be found in other regions of Spain, albeit scarcely, it is only in Álava that it has persisted. These type of customary compound surnames used to be found throughout Guipúzcoa, Navarra, Soria, Logroño, and most of Green Spain generally (i.e. the Spanish northern maritime façade exposed to the Atlantic Ocean which runs along the coastal strip lying north of the Cantabrian and Basque mountains, along the Bay of Biscay.)\n\nIn Portugal, where most of the population have two to four surnames (\"apelidos de família\"), the practice of using a double combination of surnames is very common. The person can either use a paternal and a maternal surname combined (Aníbal Cavaco Silva) or use a double last name that has been passed down through one of the parents (António Lobo Antunes). The last surname (normally the paternal one) is usually considered the \"most important\", but people may choose to use another one, often favouring the more sonant or less common of their surnames in their daily or professional life (such as Manuel Alegre or José Manuel Barroso, who is known in Portugal by his double surname Durão Barroso). The use of more than two surnames in public life is less common, but not unusual (see Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen).\n\nOne historic early aviator, Alberto Santos-Dumont, is known to have not only often used an equals sign (=) between his two surnames in place of a hyphen, but also seems to have preferred that practice, to display equal respect for his father's French ethnicity and the Brazilian nationality of his mother.\n\nIn Germany a double surname () is generally joined with a single hyphen. Other types of double surnames are not accepted by German name law. However, exceptions are made for immigrants and for marriages where the double surname already was the official name of one partner before marriage. A 1993 law forbids surnames with more than two components. Prior to this, it was permitted for adults (e.g., Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm and formerly Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann-Maier-Leibniz) but their children would not inherit the name. The 1993 ban was upheld by the Constitutional Court in 2009. The crew members of the famous First World War light cruiser were allowed to add the name \"Emden\" with a hyphen to their surname as a special honour after World War I.\n\nIn Switzerland double surnames are traditionally written with a hyphen and combine the surnames of a married couple with the husband's surname in first place and the wife's second. This double name is called \"alliance name\" (). The first name as such, however, is the official family name, which will be inherited by their legitimate children. So, for example, if Werner Stauffacher is married to Gertrud Baumgarten, both can use the name Stauffacher-Baumgarten. Their children Heinrich and Verena, however, bear only the surname Stauffacher. Prominent bearers of an alliance name are Micheline Calmy-Rey (former Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs), Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf (former Federal Minister for Finance), and Johann Schneider-Ammann (Federal Minister for the Economy). Lately, based on feminist pressure, wives have been permitted by law to place their maiden name before the family name. This double name is written without a hyphen and is borne by the wife only. So, in the example above, the wife's name is Gertrud Baumgarten Stauffacher, while her husband's is Werner Stauffacher. Again, the children's names remain Heinrich and Verena Stauffacher.\n\nDoubling of surnames is also practised by the Dutch. An example is the name of Dutch footballer Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. According to \"The Guardian\", his name derives from \"the 17th century, when two farming families in the Enschede area of the Netherlands intermarried. Both the Vennegoor and Hesselink names carried equal social weight, and so – rather than choose between them – they chose to use both. 'Of' in Dutch translates to 'or', which means that a strict translation of his name reads Jan Vennegoor or Hesselink.\" Some of these Dutch surnames also survive in South Africa, for example, the rugby player Rohan Janse van Rensburg's surname is Janse van Rensburg, not only van Rensburg (which is itself an existing surname).\n\nDenmark has a tradition of double surnames originating in the 19th century. This was a result of two naming acts obliging commoners to adopt heritable surnames, passed first for the Duchy of Schleswig in 1771, and then for Denmark proper in 1828. Most people chose their patronymic as their heritable surname, resulting in an overwhelming dominance of a few surnames.\n\nIn order to avoid the risk of mistaken identity, many Danes started using their mothers' maiden names as a heritable middle name (similar to the Russian or Hispanic system), rather than as a second given name (as in the Anglo-Saxon system). One such case in point is the fact that three successive prime ministers of Denmark all share the same last name, Rasmussen, and so they are usually referred to by their middle name, viz. Nyrup, Fogh and Løkke, respectively.\n\nToday, however, the order of the names invariably places the patronymic \"-sen\" at the end, regardless of whether that name has been passed down by the father or mother, or adopted through marriage. Unlike in the Russian or Hispanic systems, this surname-style middle name is not considered a proper last name in official documents, unless hyphenated into one compound name.\n\nIn Poland a double surname () is generally joined with a hyphen and by law includes only one hyphen. Polish surnames (\"nazwisko\" (N. sg.)), like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally patrilineal, i.e., passed from the father on to his children. A married woman usually adopts her husband's name. However, other combinations are legally possible. The wife may keep her maiden name (\"nazwisko panieńskie\") or add her husband's surname to hers, thus creating a double name (\"nazwisko złożone\"). A married man can also adopt his wife's surname, or add it to his. Polish triple-barreled surnames are known to exist; an example is the one borne by Ludwik Kos-Rabczewicz-Zubkowski, a university professor and writer, living in Canada.\n\nIn Russia, double-barreled surnames are somewhat uncommon, but normal and accepted practice, often associated with some families of note wishing to preserve both of their lineages. Federal law #143-FZ \"On Civil State Acts\" explicitly allows double-barreled names in its Article 28, but limits such compound surnames to two parts only.\n\nTurkish tradition offers options to couples after the marriage for the naming conventions. Renewing the national identity card to reflect the naming changes has two options, one is to use man's surname for the newly formed family's surname, the second is to use two surnames for the family noting that one is the bride's maiden name, the latter is the groom's surname. This highlights the equal importance of men and women in Turkish history, by giving legal opportunity to use whichever is preferable for partners. \n\nAnother double-barreled naming custom in Turkey, is that the grandfather of a newborn to give the first name, while the father of the newborn issues a middle name which is known as \"Göbek Adı\" in Turkish. In other words, \"Gobek Adi\" is the name that's been given to newborn while his/her umbilical cord is being cut. In the surname section, the tradition is to use the paternal heritage surname. For example; \nCahit Sıtkı Tarancı, Melih Cevdet Anday, Falih Rıfkı Atay and so on.\n\nSince the late 20th century, increasingly liberal legislation on the inheritance of legal surnames in many Western countries has led to the emergence of various non-traditional or \"ad hoc\" coinages of combined surnames.\nFor example, Hispanic American politician Antonio Villar and his wife Corina Raigosa adopted the \"blended\" surname \"Villaraigosa\" upon their marriage in 1987.\n\nIn some cases, courts in member states of the European Union have refused to register children under the surname given according to a foreign naming tradition.\n\nIn France a practice abolished in 2010 was to use two consecutive hyphens <nowiki>--</nowiki> (not the same as a \"long hyphen\" or dash, or with a double hyphen) to distinguish between recently formed double surnames and ancient hyphenated family names (). The use of double surnames is legal but not customary. Children traditionally take on their father's surname (or, more recently, optionally their mother's).\n\nIn Canada, especially Quebec, it is common for children born since the 1970s to bear both parents' surnames, with no established rules as to whether the father's or mother's name should come first. (In Quebec, under the provisions of the Civil Code enacted in 1980, both spouses must retain their original surnames upon marriage.) This situation was frequent enough that naming laws had to be amended in the early 1990s when those with double surnames began to marry, and wished themselves to give their children double surnames. In such cases, any combination involving at most two elements of the father's or the mother's surname is permitted.\n\nA Chinese compound surname is a Chinese surname using more than one character. Many of these surnames derive from noble and official titles, professions, place names and other areas, to serve for a purpose. Some are originally non-Han, while others were created by joining two one-character family names. Only a few of these names (e.g. Ouyang, Shangguan, Sima, Situ) survive in modern times. Many clans eventually took on a single-character surname for various reasons. A small minority of Koreans and Vietnamese also have compound surnames.\nIn 2007, PRC officials suggested that parents should be encouraged to create two-syllable (two-character) surnames for their children by combining their parents' (one-syllable) surnames; this could make people's names more unique, and \"could help solve the problem of widely recurring names\".\n\nIn India, double surnames are comparatively common, especially in Bengal, examples including Roy Chaudhury (sometimes written as Chowdhury), Ghosh Dastidar, Das Gupta, Dutta Roy, etc.. In recent years, a few notable married women have been keeping their maiden surnames resulting in a double-barred name such as Arati Ankalikar-Tikekar, Padmaja Phenany Joglekar. \n\nThe Filipino naming tradition is derived from the Hispanic system, but was influenced by the American (Anglo-Saxon) naming tradition when the Philippines became a United States colony in 1901.\nA child customarily will carry the mother's maiden name as his middle name and carry the father's surname. When the female marries, she keeps her maiden surname and adds the husband's surname, but does not typically hyphenate it. So, when Maria Santos Aguon marries José Lujan Castro, her name becomes Maria Aguon Castro and their children will typically carry the middle name Aguon, and the surname Castro.\n\nIn Nigeria, a double barrelled surname is adopted when an aristocratic woman marries a lower ranked man. It also occurs when a ruling family adopts the forename of their patriarch as part of their surname in order to distinguish themselves from others that might share their surname. An example of the former is that of the Vaughan-Richards family, a branch of the family of the American emancipated slave Scipio Vaughan, who maintain their mother's last name as well as their father's. An example of the latter is that of the royal family of King Adeniji Adele of Lagos, who are distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the use of the double barrelled name \"Adeniji-Adele\".\n\n"}

{"id": "72451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72451", "title": "Ghezo", "text": "Ghezo\n\nGhezo or Gezo was King of the Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1818 until 1858. Ghezo replaced his brother Adandozan (who ruled from 1797 to 1818) as king through a coup with the assistance of the Brazilian slave trader Francisco Félix de Sousa. He ruled over the kingdom during a tumultuous period, punctuated by the British blockade of the ports of Dahomey in order to stop the Atlantic slave trade. Ghezo finally ended Dahomey's tributary status to the Oyo empire but also dealt with significant domestic dissent and pressure from the British to end the slave trade. He promised to end the slave trade in 1852, but resumed slave efforts in 1857 and 1858. Ghezo died in 1858, possibly assassinated, and his son Glele became the new king.\n\nGhezo was a son born with the name Gakpe to King Agonglo and was a younger brother to Adandozan. When Agonglo died, there was a succession struggle between his sons before Adandozan was enthroned. An oral tradition which developed during Ghezo's rule to largely erase Adandozan from official history says that Adandozan was merely named regent and that he refused to step down for Ghezo when the latter was old enough, but this is generally doubted by historians.\n\nInformation about the final years of Adandozan's administration is very limited, providing only a partial understanding of the situation that resulted in Ghezo's rule. What is known is that around 1818, Adandozan imprisoned Francisco Félix de Sousa, a powerful Afro-Brazilian slave trader, when the latter demanded repayment for money loaned to Adandozan. With the help, reportedly, of Nicola d'Olveira, the son of the Afro-Dutch wife of Agonglo, de Sousa escaped from imprisonment and relocated to Grand-Popo. While in exile, de Sousa sent gifts and money to Ghezo that Ghezo used to establish support for a challenge to the throne. In the 1818 Annual Customs, it is said that Ghezo appeared holding the war drum in the palace and upon seeing this the \"Migan\" and \"Mehu\" (prime ministers) removed the royal sandals from Adandozan and named Ghezo the king. It is quite likely that the initial struggle was more violent than this story relates. According to some versions, Ghezo was not named the ruler at this point, but instead the regent to rule until Adandozan's son Dakpo was old enough to rule. The story says that this lasted until 1838 when Ghezo instead named his son, the future king Glele, as the crown prince, and at that point Dakpo and Adandozan led a brief fight within the palaces. The fight resulted in a fire that burned part of a palace and killed Dakpo, making Ghezo the clear king of Dahomey.\n\nGhezo's rule was defined by some important military victories, domestic dissent, and transformation of the slave trade economy. Ghezo's rule is often remembered as one of the most significant in terms of reform and change to the political order of the kingdom (although some of this is ascribing reforms that happened under Adandozan to Ghezo as part of the erasure of Adandozan's rule). In addition to the military victories, domestic dissent, and slave trade, Ghezo is also credited with expanding the arts significantly and giving royal status to many artisans to move to the capital of Abomey.\n\nHis most significant military victory was over the depleted Oyo empire in 1823. Since 1730, Dahomey had provided yearly tribute to the Oyo empire and some of its economic and military policy was controlled by Oyo interests. However, the Oyo empire had been significantly weakened over the previous 30 years and, with the rise of the Islamic jihad to the north in the Sokoto Caliphate, the empire was unable to secure its tribute from Dahomey. In the early 1820s, Ghezo refused to pay the annual tribute to Oyo. Oyo and Dahomey fought a small war early in the 1820s but violence escalated in 1823 when Oyo sent an ambassador to demand tribute and Ghezo killed him. The Oyo responded by organizing a force made up of the Mahi and other regional forces to attack Dahomey. Ghezo defeated these forces at a battle near Paouingnan. Oyo then sent a larger force that was 4,000 strong with a cavalry and camped near the village of Kpaloko. Ghezo defeated this force by organizing a night raid which resulted in the death of the Oyo leader, Ajanaku, and caused the Oyo troops to retreat.\n\nAlthough the victory over the Oyo were important, other military engagements were less effective in the early years of Ghezo's reign. He suffered losses to the Mahi people to the north of Dahomey and was unable to secure enough individuals to meet slave demands, leading him to sell citizens of Dahomey, a quite unpopular decision.\n\nWith the further reduction of Oyo power in the region, Ghezo was more able to expand militarily against the Mahi and the Gbe people to the southwest of Dahomey after the mid-1820s. Following victories in these areas, Ghezo focused the military power on a region which had been between the Oyo empire and Dahomey and had been the target of significant slave raiding. After some significant victories in this area by Dahomey, the city of Abeokuta was founded as a safe-haven for people to be free of slave raiding in an easily defended location. By the 1840s, Abeokuta had become a major power in the area and wars between Abeokuta and Dahomey became regular.\n\nIn 1849-50, British naval officer Frederick E. Forbes went on two missions to the court of King Ghezo \"in an unsuccessful attempt to convince him to end involvement in the slave trade.\"\n\nIn 1851, Ghezo organized a direct attack on the city of Abeokuta, but it did not succeed. Ghezo suspended large-scale military operations when he ended the slave trade (1852). However, by 1858 a conservative faction pressured Ghezo to begin large-scale military operations again with an assault on Abeokuta to follow. It is possible that this renewed warfare between the two states led to Ghezo's death, with some accounts claiming that Abeokuta paid for an assassination of Ghezo (other accounts disagree).\n\nGhezo is credited with the formation of the Dahomey Amazons as an actual war fighting force. Although the female bodyguard for the king had existed for many kings, Ghezo is claimed often as the king who transformed them into a force for battle. Historian Edna Bay contends that this may have been a result of a need to gain the support of the female palace guard after they had opposed Ghezo's coup against Adandozan. Ghezo did this by raising the status of the female guards, providing them uniforms, giving them additional weapons, and making them a crucial part of war policy.\n\nDomestic dissent was a significant problem throughout Ghezo's reign with different forces contesting his rule. Initially, after the coup against Adandozan, Ghezo had to secure support from a number of different individuals who helped bring him to power. Although he had initially presented himself as able to restore militaristic practices to Dahomey, which he argued Adandozan was unable to do, the early losses in his reign to the Mahi made him very unpopular. It is even reported that in 1825, he offered to return Adandozan to power but that Adandozan refused, hoping for a popular uprising against Ghezo.\n\nTo secure the support of different powerful people, Ghezo provided many of them with important positions. To secure the support of other princes, he appointed two of his brothers as the \"Migan\" and \"Mehu\" and transformed these into hereditary positions which they could pass to their sons. Since de Sousa was of crucial importance in Ghezo's rise to power, he named de Sousa the \"Chacha\" at Whydah, a position which would be the principal trade official in that port (and would also be passed to de Sousa's son). As a symbolic strike against Adandozan's legacy, Ghezo appointed Agontime his \"Kpojito\" (or queen-mother, an important post in the Kingdom of Dahomey). Agontime was a wife of Agonglo, sometimes claimed to be the mother of Ghezo, who was sold into slavery when Adandozan came to power because she supported a rival to the throne. According to some versions, Ghezo was able to secure her release from Brazil and bring her back to the kingdom, although evidence of this is not clear.\n\nWhen ending the slave trade became the crucial issue in the 1840s and 1850s, there developed two distinct factions which historian John C. Yoder has called the \"Elephant\" and the \"Fly\" parties. Ghezo was the head of the Elephant faction which supported opposition to the British demands to end the slave trade and was supported by key officials and the representatives of de Sousa. The Fly faction, in contrast, supported ending the slave trade and accommodating British demands. The Fly faction grew more powerful with the British naval blockade of 1852 and Ghezo eventually agreed to end the slave trade; however, the Elephant faction and the interests of de Souza's family remained important for the rest of his reign. Historian Robin Law largely believes that the elite factionalism to Ghezo developed in 1856 when he had reduced the slave trade. In that year, a faction for the resumption of the slave trade formed, headed by the \"Migan\" and \"Yovogan\" (governor of Whydah) which pushed Ghezo toward resuming the slave trade in 1857.\n\nOne additional way that Ghezo maintained domestic support was by lengthening the ceremony cycle in the 1850s with additions to the Annual Customs including a ceremony for the palm oil trade, one to celebrate ending tribute to the Oyo empire, and one dedicated to Ghezo himself (but to the time when he was a prince).\n\nAs part of the British campaign to abolish slavery, the British government began putting significant pressure on Ghezo in the 1840s to end the slave trade in Dahomey. Ghezo responded to these requests by emphasizing that he was unable to end the slave trade because of domestic pressure and instead proposed an expansion of palm oil trade. His domestic support had shifted as well with the declining power of Francisco Felix de Sousa and his death in 1849. The attempt at compromise with the palm oil trade was unable to be maintained following the defeat of Dahomey against Abeokuta and the establishment of a British naval blockade on the ports of Dahomey in 1851. By January 1852, Ghezo signed an agreement (along with both the \"Migan\" and the \"Mehu\") with the British. The agreement specified that Ghezo was to end the slave trade from Dahomey. The British believed that Ghezo never implemented the provisions of this treaty, although he believed he did comply by stopping slave trade through Dahomey's ports even though he allowed slaves to be traded from Dahomey to other ports and then sold into the slave trade.\n\nThe decrease in the slave trade resulted in additional reforms during the last years of Ghezo's rule. He significantly reduced the wars and slave raids by the kingdom and in 1853 told the British that he reduced the practice of human sacrifice at the Annual Customs (possibly ending sacrifice of war captives completely and only sacrificing convicted criminals). However, these positions were reversed dramatically in 1857 and 1858 as Ghezo became hostile to the British; he revived slave trade through the port of Whydah, and in 1858 attacked Abeokuta. The attack on Abeokuta was apparently resisted by Ghezo, but there was such significant domestic pressure for the attack that he allowed it to happen.\n\nThe details of Ghezo's death are different depending on the historical source. It is claimed that there was a prophecy made in the early 1850s that if Ghezo attacked the city of Ekpo, under the control of Abeokuta, he would die as a result. This may explain his resistance to the war against them in 1858. Regardless, he died very soon after the campaign in 1858. Various causes of death have been suggested, including poisoning by Dahomey priests upset at the ending of human sacrifice, smallpox, death in battle, and assassination by a sniper hired by Abeokuta.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, his heir Glele became the leader of the conservative faction that wanted the resumption of the slave trade. Glele was the official heir, but he was not the oldest son; he was challenged in his attempt to rule but was supported by the conservative faction. Many of the reforms attempted by Ghezo were partially undermined by Glele, who began slave trading, warfare, and human sacrifice to some extent.\n\nNews of his death was carried in American newspapers, with reports stating that 400 captives were murdered in honor of him.\n\nGhezo is featured in the novel \"Flash for Freedom!\" by George MacDonald Fraser.\nHe is also mentioned in the historical novel Segu, which mentions a prophecy stating that he would die of smallpox.\n\n\n"}

Both parents were descended from early English settlers, but without distinguished ancestors. Her elder brother was John Wesley Hanson (1823–1901), and she had two surviving younger brothers, Benjamin and William. Harriet's father died when she was six, leaving his widow to support four young children.\n\nHarriet's mother was determined to keep her family together, despite the difficulty in doing so. Harriet later recalled, in her autobiography \"Loom and Spindle\" , her mother's response when a neighbour offered to adopt Harriet so that her mother had one less mouth to feed: \"No; while I have one meal of victuals a day, I will not part with my children.\" She later wrote that her mother's words on that occasion stuck with her \"because of the word 'victuals whose meaning she wondered about for a long time thereafter.\n\nInitially, Mrs. Hanson ran a small store in Boston, Massachusetts, which sold food, candy, and firewood. The family lived in the back room of the shop, all sharing one bed \"two at the foot and three at the head\" as Harriet was later to recall.\nAt the invitation of Harriet's maternal aunt, Angeline Cudworth, also a widow, the family moved to Lowell, Massachusetts, a center of the textile industry.\nLowell was a planned factory town. Under the Lowell System, the company recruited young farm girls to work in the mills, building dormitories where they could live at low rents, and hiring matrons to monitor the social conduct of the girls. The company arranged for cultural events, bible studies and other educational opportunities. Initially, the pay was appealing to the women, as the alternative employment, domestic work and teaching, paid only about one-sixth as much as the mills\nHowever, working conditions were often poor and unsafe and wages low, leading to a strike in 1834.\nMrs. Hanson obtained a job running a boarding house for a textile mill company in Lowell.\n\nAt the age of ten, Harriet started to work in the Lowell mills.\nBy her own account, she wanted to work so she could earn money for herself, \nand the experience was good for her. However, there may have been an element of necessity since her mother earned little money from running the boarding house.\nHer job, which paid $2 per week, was as a \"doffer\", replacing full bobbins with empty ones.\nThe job took only a quarter of each hour, and during the free periods the children could play or read or even go home for a while.\n\nIn 1836, the Lowell Mill Girls organized their second strike, or \"turn out\" as they called them. The first strike had been in 1834 over a 15% cut in wages. This second strike was over an increase in board charges that was equivalent to a 12.5% cut in wages. To Harriet, aged eleven, it was her first strike. In her autobiography, she recounted it with pride:\n\nHarriet was harming her own mother by striking, since her mother would have benefited from the increase in boarding charges. \nHarriet was not to realize this until she was older. \nAs a consequence of the strike, several of the mills reversed the increase in charges, and the boarding system was reviewed, on the grounds that — it being the principal inducement for young women and girls to come and work at the mills in the first place — if they were so dissatisfied with it as to strike then it was not having its desired effect. But the strike leaders were fired from their jobs, as was Harriet's mother, which Harriet depicted in her autobiography as an act of petty revenge for Harriet's own actions.\n\nHarriet continued to work in the mills after the strike was over, graduating to tending a spinning frame and then becoming a \"drawing-in girl\", one of the better jobs in the mill.\nThe drawing room was relatively quiet, away from the spinning and weaving machinery.\nThe drawing-in girl took over after the warp threads had been wound onto the take-up beam, and drew each thread through the harness and reeds using a long metal hook.\nShe could sit on a stool or a chair as she worked.\nOnce this was complete, the beam would be delivered to the weaving room.\nThe pay was on a piecework basis, so Harriet could work at her own pace, and during periods when the looms were operating could\nfind a quiet room away from the machinery where she could read.\n\nHarriet obtained an elementary education before starting work in the mill.\nWhile working as a doffer, she also attended evening classes.\nAt the age of fifteen she left the mills for two years to study French, Latin and English grammar and composition at Lowell High School, \nstudying in a wooden school room in a building that had a butcher's shop on the ground floor.\nThe titles of two of her compositions have survived: \"Poverty Not Disgraceful\" and \"Indolence and Industry\", \nreflecting her opinion that there was nothing wrong with the honest labor of poor people.\nHarriet returned to the mills, working there until 1848, but in her spare time participated in literary groups in Lowell.\n\nLowell was rich in educational and cultural opportunities for women at that time.\nThere were libraries and bookstores, evening schools and lectures, concerts and balls.\nTwo of the first magazines written by women were published in the town, the \"Lowell Offering\" and \"The New England Offering\". \nBetsey Guppy Chamberlain (1797–1886), one of Harriet's companions in the mills, became a noted contributor of sketches and stories to the \"Lowell Offering\".\nHarriet said that \"the fame of \"The Lowell Offering\" caused the mill girls to be considered very desirable for wives; and that young men came from near and far to pick and choose for themselves, and generally with good success.\"\nHarriet also wrote and published poetry, and it was through this that she met her future husband William Robinson, who was working as an editor at the \"Lowell Journal\", which published some of her work.\n\nHarriet married William Stevens Robinson (1818–1876) on Thanksgiving Day of 1848, when she was twenty-three.\nAlso from a poor background, Robinson was a writer for a newspaper and a supporter of the Free Soil Party, \nwhich opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories. This made it hard for him to keep a job.\nDuring the early years of her marriage, Harriet was not interested in women's rights.\nIn her early writings she described the pleasure of having a husband to handle worldly problems, \nwhile her job was to take care of him, and said that for this reason she did not want to vote. \nHarriet later adopted the women's rights cause after her husband had taken it up.\nThe couple were to have four children, one of whom died young, and also looked after Harriet's mother.\nOften they struggled to make ends meet.\n\nIn 1858 the couple moved to Malden, a new residential suburb five miles from Boston, buying a house two blocks from the railway station.\nThis was to be Harriet's home for the rest of her life.\nAt first, Robinson struggled to earn a living as a journalist.\nThey had a large garden where they grew fruit and vegetables, and made some money by raising chickens and selling the eggs.\nAfter the Civil War, for eleven years from 1862 Robinson held a well-paying job as clerk of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.\nIn 1868 Harriet joined the American Woman's Suffrage Organization led by Lucy Stone, and founded the Malden women's club.\nRobinson was forced out of his job by the politician Benjamin Butler, and in 1876 died after a long illness.\n\nHer daughter Elizabeth was considered to be a pioneer in introducing kindergarten to Connecticut.\n\nAs a widow, Harriet Robinson rented out rooms to support herself, her three daughters and her aged mother. She wrote several books, including a biography of her husband, and became increasingly active in the women's suffrage movement. \nHarriet's book \"Loom and Spindle\" (1898) portrayed the industrial town of Lowell in her childhood and youth as a time of great opportunity for mill girls, who learned the discipline of labor and gained broader ideas about the world from their experiences. The book continues to be read more than one hundred years after it was published.\nHarriet and her daughter Harriet Lucy Robinson Shattuck organized the National Woman Suffrage Association of Massachusetts, associated with Susan B. Anthony's organization, and Harriet Robinson made the opening address at the 1881 Boston Convention of the organization. They also helped Julia Ward Howe to organize the New England Women's Club. Harriet Robinson corresponded extensively with the suffrage movement leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. When the National Woman Suffrage Association opened on 26 May 1881 at the Tremont Temple in Boston, Harriet Robinson welcomed the delegates and guests. At this session she offered the following resolution: \"\"Whereas\", We believe that it is not safe to trust the great question of woman's political rights solely to the legislature, or to the voters of the state, therefore \"Resolved\", That it is the duty of the women of Massachusetts to organize an active work, to secure a sixteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\" Harriet Robinson wrote enthusiastically in 1881,\n\nHarriet never took a theoretical position on women's rights, and may have been largely motivated by an ambition to advance in society, which the movement offered. However, she became a formidable advocate of suffrage in her writings and as a public speaker.\n\nThe poet Lucy Larcom, a friend of Harriet who had also worked in the mills as a child, wrote of her, \"Mrs. Robinson is deeply interested in all the movements, which tend to the advancement of women, and uses her pen and her voice freely in their behalf. She was the first woman to speak before the Select Committee on Woman Suffrage in Congress, and has spoken for the cause before the legislature of her own State, where she is not only a citizen, but a vote as far as the law allows.\"\n\nAdditionally, Harriet contributed to the fourteenth annual report of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor (published in 1883).The following is an excerpt from this annual report, written by Harriet Robinson:\n\nThey [the mill girls] went forth from their \"Alma Mater\", the Lowell Factory, carrying with them the independence, the self-reliance taught in that hard school, and they have done their little part towards performing the useful labor of life. Into whatever vocation they entered they have made practical use of the habits of industry and perseverance learned during those early years. Skilled labor teaches something not to be found in books or in colleges. Their early experience developed their characters ... and helped them to fight well the battle of life.\n\nHarriet lived to the age of eighty-six, dying at home in Malden on 22 December 1911.\n\nAlthough she published several books, Harriet Robinson did not make money from her writings, which she published at her own expense.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Known also as Ida Bagus Made Poleng or Ida Bagus Made Tebesaya or simply Gus Made.\n\nHe was born in Tebasaya, Ubud, Bali in 1915. Ida Bagus Made came from a Brahman family of accomplished artists in Tampaksiring, Bali. His Father, Ida Bagus kembeng (1897–1952), was a well-known painter who won the prestigious Silver Medal in 1937 at the International Colonial Art Exposition in Paris. Ida Bagus Made first learned painting and carving from his father. He later studied painting under the guidance of Rudolf Bonnet. Bonnet once wrote that Ida Bagus Made was one of the most talented artist in Bali. He was in his teens when the modernization of Balinese art began in the late 1920s, and only 21 years old when he joined the prestigious Pitamaha Artist Guild, founded in 1936 to preserve Balinese art from the threat of tourism and commercialism.\n\nHis father, Ida Bagus Kembeng had two wives: Jero Deblog and Ida Ayu Rai. Ida Bagus Made was a child from his second wife. From his marriage with Jero Deblog, Ida Bagus Kembeng had two sons: Ida Bagus Putu Wiri and Ida Bagus Made Belawa. With Ida Ayu Rai, Kembeng had a daughter, Ida Ayu Oka, and two sons: Ida Bagus Made Poleng and Ida Bagus Nyoman Raka. \n\nIda Bagus Made was married to Gusti Niang and had one daughter, Ida Ayu Sadri. Since Ida Bagus Made did not have a son, he adopted Ida Bagus Pudja, a son of his half brother, Ida Bagus Belawa.\n\nHe was known by the Balinese as a ritual specialist for carving sacred masks imbued with magical powers for the surrounding temples of Ubud. As a traditional painter of the Pitamaha generation, he became known worldwide for his artistic mastery.\n\nIda Bagus Made was a prolific painter who had a profound distrust of art dealers and collectors. He scrutinized his admirers and only a handful of collectors passed his test. The late Indonesian President Sukarno was one of such collectors that Ida Bagus Made revered. His works are well sought after and are in the collection of many museums in the world.\n\nHe died after an illness in 1999. In 2000, following the artist’s last wish, the widow of Ida Bagus Made loaned over 100 paintings from the artist’s private collection to the Puri Lukisan Museum for safekeeping.\n\nIda Bagus Made's paintings are some of the best examples of the Ubud school from the Pitamaha generation, and have not been surpassed by younger painters. His paintings have been acquired by prestigious institutions all over the world, including the United Nations, the Royal Tropical Institute Museum (Amsterdam) and the Royal Ethnographic Museum (Leiden). In Indonesia, his paintings are in the collections of former President Sukarno, the Museum Puri Lukisan, the Neka Museum, the Agung Rai Museum of Art, the Bentara Budaya Museum, and many others.\n\nSeveral most important work from Ida Bagus Made are : (1) Atomic War in Indra's Heaven (Ida Bagus Made' estate in Museum Puri Lukisan). (2) Dancing Leyak (Ida Bagus Made' Estate). (3)Three Women Shape-Shifters (Ida Bagus Made's Estate). \n\nBefore the Second World War, his paintings were included in many touring exhibitions organized by the Pitamaha Artist Guild. Exhibitions were held in the \"Kunst-ring\" (Art Circle) of Batavia (1936, 1937, 1939); Bandung (1936, 1938); Tegal (1938); Medan, Palembang and Surabaya (1939).\n\nAfter 1945, he stopped participating in any exhibitions. Not until 1998 that he gave a blessing to a solo exhibition organized by Darga Gallery (Sanur, Ubud). The exhibition (14 March - 14 April 1998) featured paintings from the Neka Museum, The Agung Rai Museum of Art and of a handful private collectors. Ida Bagus Made attended the opening of the exhibition. A short catalog, entitled \"Ida Bagus Made - Mata Air Campuhan Masa Silam\", accompanied the exhibition.\n\nIn 2001, a posthumous solo exhibition was held at the Herbert Johnson Museum of the Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. The exhibition was curated by Prof. Kaja McGowan of Cornell University. Third teen paintings from three private collectors were shown from August 18 - October 28, 2001. An exhibition leaflet: \"Suaranya Gong Kebyar: the Balinese Art of Ida Bagus Made\" was published.\n\nIn July 2008, a posthumous solo exhibition was held in Museum Puri Lukisan in Bali. This exhibition features paintings from the estate of maestro Ida Bagus Made Poleng and celebrates the visual artistry of one of the foremost painters of Ubud. Fifty paintings from the estate of the artist was presented to the public for the first time. It is accompanied by a catalog: “Ida Bagus Made – the Art of Devotion”\n"}

Burrows (October 5, 1953October 15, 2009) was wrongfully convicted of the murder of farmer William E. Dulan at his home in Iroquois County, Illinois, in 1988. After his conviction and sentence to death in 1989, Burrows was held for nearly five years on death row.\n\nPeter Rooney, a reporter for the \"Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette,\" obtained a recantation from a key witness against Burrows, and the case was reopened. Burrows' attorney, Kathleen Zellner, persuaded the real killer, Gayle Potter, to confess at the post-conviction hearing. Burrows was released in 1994.\n\nOn November 8, 1988, the body of 88-year-old farmer William E. Dulan was found at his home.\n\nGayle Potter, a cocaine addict, was picked up for forging a check of Dulan's. Her blood was found at the murder scene.\n\nIn a plea bargain, Potter admitted forging the check and taking part in the crime, but implicated two others. She claimed that Burrows, 32, had shot the older man, and also said that Ralph Frye, 22, a friend of Burrows who had slight cognitive disabilities, was involved. Potter and Frye were both sentenced to long prison terms, but Burrows was later sentenced to death.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking either Burrows or Frye to the crime. Four witnesses placed Burrows 60 miles away at the time of the crime.\n\nBurrows' first trial for the 1988 first-degree murder of William Dulan ended in a hung jury.

Burrows appealed his conviction and death sentence, but both were upheld in 1992 by the Supreme Court of Illinois.\n\nWhen learning that the Illinois Supreme Court turned down Burrows' appeal, Frye contacted a reporter and recanted his testimony against Burrows. He said he had been coerced by police into a false confession and testimony. At a post-conviction hearing, Zellner persuaded the perpetrator Gayle Potter to confess to the murder. Burrows won a new trial, at which Potter and Frye both testified. The prosecution eventually dropped charges against Burrows, and he was released in 1994.\n\nBurrows was bitter over his wrongful conviction and years on death row. He filed a civil suit against the police, and was awarded $100,000.

{"id": "145837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145837", "title": "Julian Huxley", "text": "Julian Huxley\n\nSir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS (22 June 1887 – 14 February 1975) was a British evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935–1942), the first Director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund and the first President of the British Humanist Association.\n\nHuxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. He directed an Oscar-winning wildlife film. He was awarded UNESCO's Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science in 1953, the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956, and the Darwin–Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society in 1958. He was also knighted in that same year, 1958, a hundred years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced the theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1959 he received a Special Award of the Lasker Foundation in the category Planned Parenthood – World Population. Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society and was its president from 1959–1962.\n\nThere is a public house named after Sir Julian in Selsdon, Surrey, close to the Selsdon Wood Nature Reserve which he helped establish.\n\nHuxley came from the distinguished Huxley family. His brother was the writer Aldous Huxley, and his half-brother a fellow biologist and Nobel laureate, Andrew Huxley; his father was writer and editor Leonard Huxley; and his paternal grandfather was Thomas Henry Huxley, a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin and proponent of evolution. His maternal grandfather was the academic Tom Arnold, his great-uncle was poet Matthew Arnold and his great-grandfather was Thomas Arnold of Rugby School.\nHuxley was born on 22 June 1887, at the London house of his aunt, the novelist Mary Augusta Ward, while his father was attending the jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria. Huxley grew up at the family home in Surrey, England, where he showed an early interest in nature, as he was given lessons by his grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley. When he heard his grandfather talking at dinner about the lack of parental care in fish, Julian piped up with \"What about the stickleback, Gran'pater?\" Also, according to Julian himself, his grandfather took him to visit J. D. Hooker at Kew.\n\nAt the age of thirteen Huxley attended Eton College as a King's Scholar, and continued to develop scientific interests; his grandfather had influenced the school to build science laboratories much earlier. At Eton he developed an interest in ornithology, guided by science master W. D. \"Piggy\" Hill. \"Piggy was a genius as a teacher… I have always been grateful to him.\" In 1905 Huxley won a scholarship in Zoology to Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nIn 1906, after a summer in Germany, Huxley took his place in Oxford, where he developed a particular interest in embryology and protozoa. In the autumn term of his final year, 1908, his mother died from cancer at only 46: a terrible blow for her husband, three sons, and eight-year-old daughter Margaret. That same year he won the Newdigate Prize for his poem \"Holyrood\". In 1909 he graduated with first class honours, and spent that July at the international gathering for the centenary of Darwin's birth, held at the University of Cambridge. Also, it was the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the \"Origin of species\".\n\nWhile at Oxford, he developed a friendship with the ornithologist William Warde Fowler.\n\nHuxley was awarded a scholarship to spend a year at the Naples Marine Biological Station where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating sea squirts and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds such as the common redshank (a wader) and grebes (which are divers). Bird watching in childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the great crested grebe, later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.\n\nIn 1912 his life took a new turn. He was asked by Edgar Odell Lovett to take the lead in setting up the new Department of Biology at the newly created Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas, which he accepted, planning to start the following year. Huxley made an exploratory trip to the United States in September 1912, visiting a number of leading universities as well as the Rice Institute. At T. H. Morgan's fly lab (Columbia University) he invited H. J. Muller to join him at Rice. Muller agreed to be his deputy, hurried to complete his PhD and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915–1916 academic year. At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued \"Drosophila\" lab work.\n\nBefore taking up the post of Assistant Professor at the Rice Institute, Huxley spent a year in Germany preparing for his demanding new job. Working in a laboratory just months before the outbreak of World War I, Huxley overheard fellow academics comment on a passing aircraft \"it will not be long before those planes are flying over England\". In 1913 Huxley had a nervous breakdown after the break-up of his relationship with 'K', and rested in a nursing home. His depression returned the next year, and he and his brother Trevelyan (two years his junior) ended up in the same nursing home. Sadly, Trevelyan hanged himself. Depressive illness had afflicted others in the Huxley family.\n\nOne pleasure of Huxley's life in Texas was the sight of his first hummingbird, though his visit to Edward Avery McIlhenny's estate on Avery Island in Louisiana was more significant. The McIlhennys and their Avery cousins owned the entire island, and the McIlhenny branch used it to produce their famous Tabasco sauce. Birds were one of McIlhenny's passions, however, and around 1895 he had set up a private sanctuary on the Island, called Bird City. There Huxley found egrets, herons and bitterns. These water birds, like the grebes, exhibit mutual courtship, with the pairs displaying to each other, and with the secondary sexual characteristics equally developed in both sexes.\n\nIn September 1916 Huxley returned to England from Texas to assist in the war effort. He was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps on 25 May 1917, and was transferred to the General List, working in the British Army Intelligence Corps from 26 January 1918, first in Sussex, and then in northern Italy. He was advanced in grade within the Intelligence Corps on 3 May 1918, relinquished his intelligence appointment on 10 January 1919 and was demobilised five days later, retaining his rank. After the war he became a Fellow at New College, Oxford, and was made Senior Demonstrator in the University Department of Zoology. In fact, Huxley took the place of his old tutor Geoffrey Smith, who had been killed in the battle of the Somme on the Western Front.\n\nIn 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl whom he had met at Garsington Manor, the country house of Lady Ottoline Morrell, a Bloomsbury Group socialite with a penchant for artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life together included students, faculty wives, grebes and, unfortunately, another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness took the form of a bipolar disorder, with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. It took a long time for him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.\n\nIn 1925 Huxley moved to King's College London as Professor of Zoology, but in 1927, to the amazement of his colleagues and on the prodding of H. G. Wells whom he had promised 1,000 words a day, he resigned his chair to work full-time with Wells and his son G. P. Wells on \"The Science of Life\" (see below). For some time Huxley retained his room at King's College, and continued as Honorary Lecturer in the Zoology Department. From 1927 to 1931 he was also Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution, where he gave an annual lectures series. No one realised it at the time , but he had come to the end of his life as a university academic.\n\nIn 1929, after finishing work on \"The Science of Life\", Huxley visited East Africa to advise the Colonial Office on education in British East Africa (for the most part Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika). He discovered that the wildlife on the Serengeti plain was almost undisturbed because the tsetse fly (the vector for the trypanosome parasite which causes sleeping sickness in humans) prevented human settlement there. He tells about these experiences in \"Africa view\" (1931), and so does his wife. She reveals that he fell in love with an 18-year-old American girl on board ship (when Juliette was not present), and then presented Juliette with his ideas for an open marriage: \"What Julian really wanted was… a definite freedom from the conventional bonds of marriage.\" The couple separated for a while; Julian travelled to the US, hoping to land a suitable appointment and, in due course, to marry Miss Weldmeier. He left no account of what transpired, but he was evidently not successful, and returned to England to resume his marriage in 1931. For the next couple of years Huxley still angled for an appointment in the US, without success.\n\nAs the 1930s started, Huxley travelled widely and took part in a variety of activities which were partly scientific and partly political. In 1931 Huxley visited the USSR at the invitation of Intourist, where initially he admired the results of social and economic planning on a large scale. Later, back in the United Kingdom, he became a founding member of the think tank Political and Economic Planning.\n\nIn the 1930s Huxley visited Kenya and other East African countries to see the conservation work, including the creation of national parks, which was happening in the few areas that remained uninhabited due to malaria. From 1933 to 1938 he was a member of the committee for Lord Hailey's African Survey.\n\nIn 1935 Huxley was appointed secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and spent much of the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said \"He was impatient… and lacked tact\". He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine. Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right.\n\nIn 1941 Huxley was invited to the United States on a lecturing tour, and generated some controversy by saying that he thought the United States should join World War II: a few weeks later came the attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war, he found it difficult to get a passage back to the UK, and his lecture tour was extended. The Council of the Zoological Society—\"a curious assemblage… of wealthy amateurs, self-perpetuating and autocratic\"—uneasy with their secretary, used this as an opportunity to remove him. This they did by abolishing his post \"to save expenses\". Since Huxley had taken a half-salary cut at the start of the war, and no salary at all whilst he was in America, the Council's action was widely read as a personal attack on Huxley. A public controversy ensued, but eventually the Council got its way.\n\nIn 1943 he was asked by the British government to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The Commission's remit was to survey the West African Commonwealth countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with hepatitis, and had a serious mental breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with ECT, and took a full year to recover. He was 55.\n\nHuxley, a lifelong internationalist with a concern for education, got involved in the creation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and became the organization's first director-general in 1946. His term of office, six years in the Charter, was cut down to two years at the behest of the American delegation. The reasons are not known for sure, but his left-wing tendencies and humanism were likely factors. In a fortnight he dashed off a 60-page booklet on the purpose and philosophy of UNESCO, eventually printed and issued as an official document. There were, however, many conservative opponents of his scientific humanism. His idea of restraining population growth with birth control was anathema to both the Catholic Church and the Comintern/Cominform. In its first few years UNESCO was dynamic and broke new ground; since Huxley it has become larger, more bureaucratic and stable. The personal and social side of the years in Paris are well described by his wife.\n\nHuxley's internationalist and conservation interests also led him, with Victor Stolan, Sir Peter Scott, Max Nicholson and Guy Mountfort, to set up the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature under its former name of the World Wildlife Fund).\n\nAnother post-war activity was Huxley's attack on the Soviet politico-scientist Trofim Lysenko, who had espoused a Lamarckian heredity, made unscientific pronouncements on agriculture, used his influence to destroy classical genetics in Russia and to move genuine scientists from their posts. In 1940, the leading botanical geneticist Nikolai Vavilov was arrested, and Lysenko replaced him as director of the Institute of Genetics. In 1941, Vavilov was tried, found guilty of 'sabotage' and sentenced to death. Reprieved, he died in jail of malnutrition in 1943. Lysenko's machinations were the cause of his arrest. Worse still, Lysenkoism not only denied proven genetic facts, it stopped the artificial selection of crops on Darwinian principles. This may have contributed to the regular shortage of food from the Soviet agricultural system (Soviet famines). Huxley, who had twice visited the Soviet Union, was originally not anti-communist, but the ruthless adoption of Lysenkoism by Joseph Stalin ended his tolerant attitude. Lysenko ended his days in a Soviet mental hospital, and Vavilov's reputation was posthumously restored in 1955.\n\nIn the 1950s Huxley played a role in bringing to the English-speaking public the work of the French Jesuit-palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who he believed had been unfairly treated by the Catholic and Jesuit hierarchy. Both men believed in evolution, but differed in its interpretation as de Chardin was a Christian, whilst Huxley was an unbeliever. Huxley wrote the foreword to \"The Phenomenon of Man\" (1959) and was bitterly attacked by his rationalist friends for doing so.\n\nOn Huxley's death at 87 in 1975, John Owen (Director of National Parks for Tanganyika) wrote \"Julian Huxley was one of the world's great men… he played a seminal role in wild life conservation in [East] Africa in the early days… [and in] the far-reaching influence he exerted [on] the international community\".\n\nIn addition to his international and humanist concerns, his research interests covered evolution in all its aspects, ethology, embryology, genetics, anthropology and to some extent the infant field of cell biology. Julian's eminence as an advocate for evolution, and especially his contribution to the modern evolutionary synthesis, led to his awards of the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956, and the Darwin–Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society in 1958. 1958 was the centenary anniversary of the joint presentation \"On the tendency of species to form varieties; and the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection\" by Darwin and Wallace.\n\nHuxley was a friend and mentor of the biologists and Nobel laureates Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, and taught and encouraged many others. In general, he was more of an all-round naturalist than his famous grandfather, and contributed much to the acceptance of natural selection. His outlook was international, and somewhat idealistic: his interest in progress and evolutionary humanism runs through much of his published work. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nHuxley and biologist August Weismann insisted on natural selection as the primary agent in evolution. Huxley was a major player in the mid-twentieth century modern evolutionary synthesis. He was a prominent populariser of biological science to the public, with a focus on three aspects in particular.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a modern survey of the idea of progress in evolution see Nitecki and Dawkins.\n\nHuxley's humanism came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: \"The critical point in the evolution of man… was when he acquired the use of [language]… Man's development is potentially open… He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which… largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change\". Both Huxley and his grandfather gave Romanes Lectures on the possible connection between evolution and ethics. (see evolutionary ethics) Huxley's views on god could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.\n\nHuxley had a close association with the British rationalist and secular humanist movements. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1927 until his death, and on the formation of the British Humanist Association in 1963 became its first President, to be succeeded by AJ Ayer in 1965. He was also closely involved with the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Many of Huxley's books address humanist themes. In 1962 Huxley accepted the American Humanist Association's annual \"Humanist of the Year\" award.\n\nHuxley also presided over the founding Congress of the International Humanist and Ethical Union and served with John Dewey, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann on the founding advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York.\n\nHuxley wrote that \"There is no separate supernatural realm: all phenomena are part of one natural process of evolution. There is no basic cleavage between science and religion;… I believe that [a] drastic reorganization of our pattern of religious thought is now becoming necessary, from a god-centered to an evolutionary-centered pattern\". Some believe the appropriate label for these views is religious naturalism.\nMany people assert that this abandonment of the god hypothesis means the abandonment of all religion and all moral sanctions. This is simply not true. But it does mean, once our relief at jettisoning an outdated piece of ideological furniture is over, that we must construct something to take its place.\n\nHuxley took interest in investigating the claims of parapsychology and spiritualism. He joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1928. After investigation he found the field to be unscientific and full of charlatans. In 1934, he joined the International Institute for Psychical Research but resigned after a few months due to its members spiritualist bias and non-scientific approach to the subject.\n\nAfter attending séances, Huxley concluded that the phenomena could be explained \"either by natural causes, or, more usually by fraud\". Huxley, Harold Dearden and others were judges for a group formed by the \"Sunday Chronicle\" to investigate the materialization medium Harold Evans. During a séance Evans was exposed as a fraud. He was caught masquerading as a spirit, in a white nightshirt.\n\nIn 1952, Huxley wrote the foreword to Donovan Rawcliffe's \"The Psychology of the Occult\".\n\nHuxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society, and was Vice-President (1937–1944) and President (1959–1962). He thought eugenics was important for removing undesirable variants from the human gene pool, though after World War II he believed race was a meaningless concept in biology, and its application to humans was highly inconsistent.\n\nHuxley was an outspoken critic of the most extreme eugenicism in the 1920s and 1930s (the stimulus for which was the greater fertility of the 'feckless' poor compared to the 'responsible' prosperous classes). He was, nevertheless, a leading figure in the eugenics movement (see, for example, Eugenics manifesto). He gave the Galton memorial lecture twice, in 1936 and 1962. In his writing he used this argument several times: \"no one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ plasm of agricultural stocks, so why not apply the same concept to human stocks?\" \"The agricultural analogy appears over and over again as it did in the writings of many American eugenicists.\"\n\nHuxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior. In this passage, from 1941, he investigates a hypothetical scenario where social darwinism, capitalism, nationalism and the class society is taken for granted:\n\nIf so, then we must plan our eugenic policy along some such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, allegedly less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.\n\nHere, he does not demean the working class in general, but aims for \"the virtual elimination of the few lowest and most degenerate types\". The sentiment is not at all atypical of the time, and similar views were held by many geneticists (William E. Castle, C.B. Davenport, H. J. Muller are examples), and by other prominent intellectuals.\n\nHowever, Huxley advocated a completely different alternative, in which the lower classes are ensured a nutritious diet, education and facilities for recreation:\n\nWe must therefore concentrate on producing a single equalized environment; and this clearly should be one as favourable as possible to the expression of the genetic qualities that we think desirable. Equally clearly, this should include the following items. A marked raising of the standard of diet for the great majority of the population, until all should be provided both with adequate calories and adequate accessory factors; provision of facilities for healthy exercise and recreation; and upward equalization of educational opportunity. ... we know from various sources that raising the standard of life among the poorest classes almost invariably results in a lowering of their fertility. In so far, therefore, as differential class-fertility exists, raising the environmental level will reduce any dysgenic effects which it may now have.\n\nConcerning a public health and racial policy in general, Huxley wrote that \"…unless [civilised societies] invent and enforce adequate measures for regulating human reproduction, for controlling the quantity of population, and \"at least preventing the deterioration of quality of racial stock\", they are doomed to decay …\" and remarked how biology should be the chief tool for rendering social politics scientific.\n\nIn the opinion of Duvall, \"His views fell well within the spectrum of opinion acceptable to the English liberal intellectual elite. He shared \"Nature\"s enthusiasm for birth control, and 'voluntary' sterilization.\" However, the word 'English' in this passage is unnecessary: such views were widespread. Duvall comments that Huxley's enthusiasm for centralised social and economic planning and anti-industrial values was common to leftist ideologists during the inter-war years. Towards the end of his life, Huxley himself must have recognised how unpopular these views became after the end of World War II. In the two volumes of his autobiography, there is no mention of eugenics in the index, nor is Galton mentioned; and the subject has also been omitted from many of the obituaries and biographies. An exception is the proceedings of a conference organised by the British Eugenics Society.\n\nIn response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s, he was asked to write \"We Europeans\" with the ethnologist A. C. Haddon, the zoologist Alexander Carr-Saunders and the historian of science Charles Singer. Huxley suggested the word 'race' be replaced with ethnic group. After the Second World War, he was instrumental in producing the UNESCO statement \"The Race Question\", which asserted that:\n\nA race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species \"Homo sapiens\"\"… \"National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cult groups do not necessary coincide with racial groups: the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connexion with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of \"ethnic groups\"\"… \"Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists, but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions, as follows: The Mongoloid Division; The Negroid Division; The Caucasoid Division.\" … \"Catholics, Protestants, Moslems and Jews are not races … The biological fact of race and the myth of 'race' should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes 'race' is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth 'race' has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken a heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering. It still prevents the normal development of millions of human beings and deprives civilization of the effective co-operation of productive minds. The biological differences between ethnic groups should be disregarded from the standpoint of social acceptance and social action. The unity of mankind from both the biological and social viewpoint is the main thing. To recognize this and to act accordingly is the first requirement of modern man …\n\nHuxley won the second Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for \"We Europeans\" in 1937.\n\nIn 1957, Huxley coined the term \"transhumanism\" for the view that humans should better themselves through science and technology, possibly including eugenics, but also, importantly, the improvement of the social environment.\n\nHuxley was always able to write well, and was ever willing to address the public on scientific topics. Well over half his books are addressed to an educated general audience, and he wrote often in periodicals and newspapers. The most extensive bibliography of Huxley lists some of these ephemeral articles, though there are others unrecorded.\n\nThese articles, some reissued as \"Essays of a biologist\" (1923), probably led to the invitation from H. G. Wells to help write a comprehensive work on biology for a general readership, \"The Science of Life\". This work was published in stages in 1929–30, and in one volume in 1931. Of this Robert Olby said \"Book IV \"The essence of the controversies about evolution\" offers perhaps the clearest, most readable, succinct and informative popular account of the subject ever penned. It was here that he first expounded his own version of what later developed into the evolutionary synthesis\". In his memoirs, Huxley says that he made almost £10,000 from the book.\n\nIn 1934 Huxley collaborated with the naturalist Ronald Lockley to create for Alexander Korda the world's first natural history documentary \"The Private Life of the Gannets\". For the film, shot with the support of the Royal Navy around Grassholm off the Pembrokeshire coast, they won an Oscar for best documentary.\n\nHuxley had given talks on the radio since the 1920s, followed by written versions in \"The Listener\". In later life, he became known to an even wider audience through television. In 1939 the BBC asked him to be a regular panelist on a Home Service general knowledge show, \"The Brains Trust\", in which he and other panelists were asked to discuss questions submitted by listeners. The show was commissioned to keep up war time morale, by preventing the war from \"disrupting the normal discussion of interesting ideas\". The audience was not large for this somewhat elite programme; however, listener research ranked Huxley the most popular member of the Brains Trust from 1941 to 1944.\n\nLater, he was a regular panelist on one of the BBC's first quiz shows (1955) \"Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?\" in which participants were asked to talk about objects chosen from museum and university collections.\n\nIn 1937 Huxley was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on \"Rare Animals and the Disappearance of Wild Life\".\n\nIn his essay \"The Crowded World\" Huxley was openly critical of Communist and Catholic attitudes to birth control, population control and overpopulation. Based on variable rates of compound interest, Huxley predicted a probable world population of 6 billion by 2000. The United Nations Population Fund marked 12 October 1999 as The Day of Six Billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She has been the bass guitarist and co-vocalist for the Canadian indie rock band Eric's Trip since its formation in 1990. She has released ten solo albums, beginning with 1996's \"Broken Girl\", and is also the lead singer for the band Julie and the Wrong Guys.\n\nDoiron started playing guitar (later switching to bass) in Eric's Trip at the age of 18, having joined the band at the insistence of her then-boyfriend, Eric's Trip guitarist Rick White. Shortly before the band's break-up in 1996, she released a solo album under the name Broken Girl, which followed two previous 7\" EPs (\"Dog Love, Pt. 2\" & \"Nora\") also released under that name. All of her subsequent material has been released under her own name. Although most of her solo material has been written and performed in English, she also released an album of French language material, \"Désormais\".\n\nIn 1999, Doiron performed at the 1999 Stardust Picnic festival at Historic Fort York, Toronto. That year she recorded an album with the Ottawa band Wooden Stars, which was the first time she had worked with a band since the end of Eric's Trip. She shared a Juno Award for \"Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars\" in March 2000.\n\nEric's Trip reunited in 2001, and have played shows periodically ever since. She has also appeared as a guest musician on albums by The Tragically Hip (2000s \"Music at Work\"), Gordon Downie (2001's \"Coke Machine Glow\", 2003's \"Battle of the Nudes\" and 2010's \"The Grand Bounce\"), and Herman Düne. She has also released a split record co-credited to the alternative country band Okkervil River, and collaborated with Frederick Squire and American musician Phil Elverum on the 2008 Mount Eerie album \"Lost Wisdom\". She played with indie rock band Shotgun & Jaybird until their demise in 2007. She also played drums as part of a short-lived duo with Fred Squire. Initially called \"Blue Heeler\", they changed their name to \"Calm Down Its Monday\", and released a split 7\" EP on K Records, with two solo Doiron songs on the flip side.\n\nApart from her musical career, Doiron is an avid photographer, having published a book of her photographs entitled \"The Longest Winter\" with words by Ottawa writer Ian Roy. She often does her own promotional photos and cover artwork along with her ex-husband, painter Jon Claytor.\n\nHer album \"Woke Myself Up\" was shortlisted for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize.\n\nIn 2009, Doiron told a reporter from \"The Strand\", a college newspaper at the University of Toronto, that she and Chad VanGaalen were exploring the possibility of collaborating on an album. She appeared on a track from VanGaalen's EP of \"Soft Airplane\" B-sides that year, but no further news pertaining to a potential album collaboration has been released.\n\nDuring the tour to support the 2009 album \"I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day\", the mayor of Bruno, Saskatchewan proclaimed June 7, 2009 as \"Julie Doiron Day\". Doiron performed at the local All Citizens arts centre on that day.\n\nOver the three-year period between \"I Can Wonder\" and her 2012 album \"So Many Days\", Doiron moved several times, residing at different times in Montreal, Toronto and Sackville. While living in Toronto, she had difficulty making ends meet due to the city's high cost of living, and began teaching yoga classes, and performing a weekly residency at the Saving Gigi club, to help pay the bills. By the time \"So Many Days\" was released in the fall of 2012, she had moved back to Sackville.\n\nIn July 2014, Doiron's song \"The Life of Dreams\", from \"I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day\", appeared in an iPhone commercial.\n\nIn 2016, Doiron collaborated with musicians Jon McKiel, C.L.

Musyoka served in the government under President Daniel arap Moi and was Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1993 until 1998; subsequently, under President Mwai Kibaki, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs again from 2003 to 2004, then Minister of the Environment from 2004 to 2005. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2007 presidential election, after which he was appointed as Vice-President by Kibaki in January 2008.\n\nMusyoka is the party leader of the Wiper Democratic Movement (formerly Orange Democratic Movement-Kenya). He also serves as Chief Commissioner for The Kenya Scouts Association.\n\nHe was born in Tseikuru, in a remote part of Mwingi District (then part of Kitui District) in Kenya's Eastern Province. Between 1960 and 1967 he studied at Tseikuru Full Primary School to attain basic education. Then he went to Kitui High School in Kitui for the ordinary level and eventually to Meru School in Meru from where he graduated in the advanced level in 1973. Kalonzo Musyoka graduated with a Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Nairobi in 1977. He continued further studies at the Kenya School of Law in 1978 where he was awarded a Post graduate diploma in Law. In 1979, he attended the Mediterranean Institute of Management in Cyprus where he earned a post graduate Diploma in Business.\n\nIn 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity among other 17 beneficiaries at the Charter hall in Nairobi. This was one the \"honorary professorships and doctorate degrees\" that were issued by Professor Clyde Rivers, the International Commissioner of the Latin University of Theology, based in Inglewood, California.<br> On 19 December 2008, Kalonzo Musyoka was honoured with a Doctorate in Humane Letters (honoris causa) in recognition of his achievements in peace making, conflict resolution efforts, sustainable community development and humanistic ideals by Kenyatta University during its 25th graduation. Named African Dignitary Man of the year 2016\n\nMusyoka vied for the Kitui North Constituency parliamentary seat in 1983, but was defeated. At the time, Kenya was one-party state and the only party fielding candidates was Kenya African National Union (KANU). However, only two years later, in 1985 the Kitui North seat was vacated and Musyoka won subsequent by-elections, thus becoming an MP at the age of 32. In 1986 he was appointed Assistant Minister for Works, Housing and Physical Planning, serving until 1988. He was re-elected at the 1988 parliamentary elections and served as Deputy Speaker of the National assembly from 1988 to 1992. He was also KANU's National Organizing Secretary from 1988 to 2002.\n\nKenya's first multiparty elections were held in 1992. Musyoka stayed in KANU, renewed his parliamentary position and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. He also held couple of other ministerial positions while part of the KANU government.\nIn June 1993, he addressed the World Conference on Human Rights in Austria which was the first human rights conference held since the end of the Cold War. He termed the illicit mineral trade which fuels and finances what he called 'the cause of incessant conflicts, environmental degradation but ultimately and sadly too, poverty'. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action was the major result from this meeting after the participants reached a consensus.\n\nHe was again elected to the parliament at the 1997 elections, but now from Mwingi North Constituency, since his former constituency Kitui North was split into new constituencies.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2002 general election, under the leadership of then KANU secretary general, Raila Odinga, he decamped from KANU to join the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a founding member under the banner of the National Rainbow Coalition, which went on to win the general elections.\n\nOn 1 December 2003, as the Minister for home affairs and international co-operation for Kenya, he welcomed the people to this meeting, whose theme was Strengthening the role of IGAD in regional peace initiatives and post conflict reconstruction on behalf of the republic of Kenya and thanked the Danish government, IGAD Secretariat and the ISS on behalf of the IGAD Member States for their preparations and funding of the meeting. Kalonzo Musyoka was involved in the Sudan peace process between 1993 and 1997 and he was part of the team that reconstituted the draft establishing IGAD in 1995.\n\nMusyoka became Minister for Foreign Affairs for a second time under President Mwai Kibaki, but in a cabinet reshuffle on 30 June 2004 he was moved to the post of Minister for the Environment. In late August 2004, he was additionally removed from his position as chairman of the Sudanese and Somali peace talks and was replaced by John Koech. Musyoka was reportedly unhappy with President Kibaki's refusal to honour a pre-election \"Memorandum of understanding\" (MOU) which they had signed with the president's party NAK. He was one of the leaders of the successful \"No\"-campaign in the November 2005 referendum on the proposed new constitution. Following the referendum, he was dismissed from the Cabinet.\n\nSubsequently, Kalonzo Musyoka decamped Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) into the little-known Labor Party of Kenya.\n\nKalonzo Musyoka was widely expected to vie for the presidency in the December 2007 election. Musyoka campaigned for the ODM-Kenya ticket, facing a number of other contenders. His rating for December 2007 election steadily dropped, and political analysts wondered whether he would make a significant impact. His relationship with fellow ODM-Kenya leader Raila Odinga, who was also after the ODM-Kenya presidential ticket, was the subject of much speculation. Many observers questioned whether the presidential hopefuls of ODM-Kenya, particularly Raila and Musyoka, could unite to support one common candidate for the general election.\n\nThe ODM-Kenya split into two factions, one gathered around Musyoka and the other around Odinga, in August 2007. Musyoka was elected by his faction as its presidential candidate on 31 August 2007, receiving 2,835 votes in a secret ballot against Julia Ojiambo, who received 791 votes.\n\nMusyoka has been quoted as saying \"... the war against poverty could not be won unless environmental issues were addressed.\"\n\nMusyoka launched his presidential campaign at Uhuru Park in Nairobi on 14 October 2007. This move was criticised by those who saw him as a traitor to the ODM party of Raila Odinga. Kalonzo however said that \"atapitia katikati\" (passing between two people).\n\nAccording to official results, Musyoka placed a distant third behind Kibaki and Odinga with 9% of the vote. Amid a violent crisis over the results, with supporters of Kibaki and Odinga disputing the outcome, Kibaki appointed Musyoka as Vice-President and Minister of Home Affairs on 8 January 2008. Musyoka expressed gratitude to Kibaki and, referring to the ongoing dispute and violence, said that he was \"intensely aware that the appointment has come at a difficult time when our nation is going through a painful moment\". He took office as Vice-President on 9 January.\nThe political crisis eventually led to the signing of a power-sharing agreement between Kibaki and Odinga. In the Grand Coalition Cabinet that was announced on 13 April 2008, Musyoka remained Vice-President and Minister of Home Affairs.\n\nIn 2010 Musyoka supported the draft constitution in the campaign for 4 August referendum but Members of the campaign team opposing the draft constitution claimed that he was secretly opposing the draft leading to a satirical comparison of Musyoka to a watermelon which is naturally green outside and red inside, the team supporting the draft constitution was represented by color green while the team opposing the draft constitution was represented by the color red hence the \"green team\" and the \"red team\", Musyoka's nickname watermelon was because of his alleged open support for the green team and secret support for the red team. Most of the opposition of the draft constitution were the clergy.\n\nIn the race for the 4th president of Kenya, Kalonzo Musyoka joined his longtime political opponent Raila Odinga to form the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) with Musyoka shelving his presidential ambition to run as Odinga's running mate.\n\nWhen the first round of the presidential election took place on 4 March 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the president-elect of Kenya by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Raila Odinga challenged this in the Supreme Court of Kenya. Questions were raised why Musyoka was not a petitioner in the case.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court dismissed the CORD Petition, he left office when the President-elect, Uhuru Kenyatta, was sworn in.\n\nDr Kalonzo Musyoka has, since 10 June 2013, served as the University Chancellor of the Uganda Technology and Management University (UTAMU), a privately owned university in Uganda, based in Kampala, that country's capital and largest city.\n\nKalonzo Musyoka is married to Pauline. They have four children. He was baptised by Pastor Masila Munyoki. He is the patron of the Kalonzo Musyoka Foundation and he has served since 2006.\n\n"}

Mario is a massive Big Brother fan and owns the Diary Room chair from Big Brother 2006. Unlike the other contestants, Mario was chosen to be a housemate by a random draw rather than by being hand picked by the Big Brother producers. Because he was chosen randomly, Big Brother made Mario the house \"\"mole\" in what the show described as an \"impossible\"\" task to avoid eviction. Mario was provided with a mole costume and sign to wear around his neck stating that he is a mole which he was instructed to wear twenty-four hours a day. As part of his task Mario was required to undertake several tasks, including ruining his housemates' food and cigarettes. In a vote, set up by Big Brother, the majority of the housemates incorrectly guessed that Sunshine was the house mole and as a result Mario was permitted to remain in the house.

She has a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of East London, a master's degree in occupational psychology from Goldsmiths, University of London, and an MBA qualification from Imperial College Business School. During the process, Edna lead her team to a win in Week 2, despite making the questionable decision to pitch at a games fair herself, when there were a number other candidates who would arguably have been more suitable; many of the team thought the pitch had cost them victory, and were surprised to learn they had won by a large margin. After 5 successive task wins, Edna was brought into the boardroom in Week 6 by Zoe Beresford, where she was accused of claiming credit for the successful ideas of others. When Lord Sugar asked why he should let Edna continue, she highlighted her academic qualifications, but this only resulted in her digging an even bigger hole for herself, and Lord Sugar fired her. She later that she should have brought up her professional experience. She was the only candidate that eventual winner Tom Pellereau didn't work with during the series.\n\nZoe Beresford, 26, was a pupil of Abbots Bromley School, an independent school in the village of Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire, and holds a master's degree in manufacturing, engineering and management from the University of Nottingham, where she was awarded a Rolls-Royce Manufacturing Technology Prize for the School of Engineering's highest dissertation mark. She lives in Arclid, Cheshire and worked as a Project Manager for a drinks manufacturer until January 2011, when she was appointed territory manager for an outdoor/snow footwear retail company. She suffered two bouts of cancer, aged 15 and 18. On The Apprentice, Zoe came to the fore in week 3 when she was brought into the boardroom by Gavin Winstanley for disruptive behaviour, although she got off lightly since Lord Sugar did not hold directly responsible for the loss. In week 4 she was placed in the role of Project manager for Venture in the beauty treatments task. She relied on industry expert Susan Ma's advice when choosing product quantities, but halved the size of the order after consideration; even the new quantity proved far too much, as Venture only made a little over £200, a poor figure for such a market. Zoe blamed this on Susan on the task, and on the \"You're Fired\" programme that followed, Felicity Jackson took the view Zoe had been setting Susan up as a potential scapegoat.\n\nIn week 6 Zoe took on the role of Project manager again, but on this occasion she lost the task after failing to secure both of the deals arranged by Lord Sugar for waste disposal. Although Zoe was tearful at the end of the first day over the failure, she rallied on the second and Venture made separate deals of their own, so the end result was a difference of only £6. Zoe brought Susan and Edna into the boardroom, and once again came into conflict with Susan, who perceived Zoe as unnecessarily negative and unpleasant, while Zoe considered Susan to be naive and immature. Zoe's survival was mostly a result of her admitting fault at the first opportunity. In week 9, Zoe became project manager for the biscuit-making task, something similar to her day job before the series. However, her decision to manage marketing rather than the factory led to a snap and share biscuit design that was deemed to be too poor a quality to warrant the price. This led to team Logic securing no orders and suffering the worst defeat in the show's history. Lord Sugar decided to fire Zoe for not showcasing her strengths.\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Alex is a manager of an estate agency. Alex was criticised in week 1 for selling only £8 worth on the task, spending most of the day cutting bread and serving soup. Edward Hunter's decision not to bring Alex back into the boardroom was a major reason he was fired. In the second week Alex, was the only member of Logic who did not put himself forward to be project manager, and once again had little presence on the task; the rest of the team declared him the weakest team member on both tasks, with Jim Eastwood going as far as to call him a \"spectator\". In the boardroom he mounted a vigorous defence, attacking Jim, although Jim countered by stating Alex's contribution had been \"nada\". Lord Sugar remained unimpressed, and Alex was fired for not showing any leadership potential and for staying in the background rather than stepping up.\n\nIn a clip shown on \"You're Fired!\" he was mocked by fellow contestant Glenn Ward who said \"Alex? I always forget him.\" owing to him staying in the background.\n\nVincent Disneur was educated at St. Anselm's Catholic School, a voluntary aided Roman Catholic secondary school in Canterbury in Kent.\n\nDisneur stepped up to lead the team in the fifth week of the process, but was subsequently fired alongside Ellie Reed in a double firing. While on \"The Apprentice\", Vincent had never been on a winning team.\n\nLeon Doyle is a 26-year-old graduate who was educated at two independent schools in the town of Harrogate in Yorkshire, at which he was a day boarder: at West End Preparatory School, a former boys' preparatory school and Ashville College, a co-educational senior school, followed by the University of Huddersfield. He lived in Leeds and founded the business 'The Master Menu'. He was fired on 22 June (week 8), during a task concerning taking British products into the French Market. He was accused of not contributing enough to the task and using the language barrier as an excuse.\n\nJim Eastwood is a 32-year-old Sales & Marketing Manager from Northern Ireland. He was educated at St Mary's Grammar School, a state grammar school in Magherafelt, and went on to study at the University of Ulster.\n\nEastwood started work in his father's fish & chip shop chipping potatoes from the age of nine and went on to maintain top sales performances as a Sales and Marketing Manager. Jim, who was \"All Ireland cycling champion\" as a teenager, champions Richard Branson and describes himself as 'driven, self-motivated, resilient and an eternal optimist.' He said that \"I'm not a show pony or a one-trick pony, I'm not a jack-ass or a stubborn mule, and I'm definitely not a wild stallion that needs to be tamed. I am the champion thoroughbred that this process requires.\"\n\nEastwood made it to the final, where he proposed an education business called \"AMSmart\" but was eventually fired. On \"\", Dara Ó Briain nicknamed him \"Jedi Jim\" because of his uncanny ability to persuade and influence people.\n\nMelody and her family fled from Iran when she was a child, and after living for a few years in Sweden, they settled in the UK. Melody started school in the UK at the age of 13, and was educated at Great Wyrley High School, a state comprehensive school in the large village of Great Wyrley in South Staffordshire. She says that she felt culturally different from the other pupils, some of whom \"had not even visited London\", while she had lived in several countries. Nevertheless, she performed well in her GCSEs and A-levels before going on to Oxford Brookes University, where she obtained a 2:1 LLB Hons. Law degree. She has lived in four countries and speaks five different languages.\n\nMelody was the first ever Social Entrepreneur to compete on The Apprentice. Melody is the Founder and CEO of social enterprise, InspirEngage International. Starting her career aged 13, she now specialises in Skills Training to support individuals into employment and enterprise, through delivery of tailored 'InspirEngage Skills Bootcamps'. She began the series confidently, coming up with the team name 'Venture' and winning as Project Manager on the first week and avoiding the boardroom for a number of tasks. She made it to week ten, before being fired by Lord Sugar 'with regret'.\n\nEdward is a 25-year-old accountant who was trained by one of the United Kingdom's leading accountancy firms. He was the first candidate to be fired in the seventh series of The Apprentice by Lord Sugar.\n\nFelicity attended St Albans High School for Girls, an independent school in Hertfordshire, followed by The Court Theatre Training Company. Felicity has set up Casting Days Ltd, and Surviving Actors Ltd - both aimed at actors, and offers different services to help within their career. After three consecutive victories on team Venture, Felicity was moved to Logic to be Project Manager for the Beauty Treatment task; Lord Sugar commented he had not seen much of her up to this point. Unfortunately, Logic's attempt at the task was a total disaster - Felicity later stated on \"You're Fired\" that several mistakes were not even included in the final cut of the episode. Logic were already disadvantaged before they had started selling, as they not only failed to secure the spray-tan system, but more crucially chose a bad location, with the single treatment room being three floors above their selling stall. Felicity then compounded this mistake by over-ordering on products and failing to drive customers upstairs, which was put down to her poor communication with her teammates. Logic thus made a loss of over £200, and Felicity was fired for extreme indecisiveness and poor decision-making. Felicity has since secured a contract with casting website StarNow for her company Casting Days Ltd. She works with casting directors, agents, directors, producers and many more industry professionals, connecting them with StarNow talent. \n\nSusan is a 21-year-old Managing Director of Tropic Skin Care Ltd. She was educated at Croydon High School, an independent school for girls in Croydon in South London, and graduated in 2010 from University College London with a 2:1 in Philosophy and Economics. She was described by Nick Hewer as \"a little force to be reckoned with\"...  At the beginning of the process, Susan had difficulty making herself heard, but in Week 3 led Venture to a narrow victory on the Discount Buying task - although her team only got small discounts, they managed to locate 9 of the 10 items, in contrast to Logic's 6. Her performance in week 4 on the Beauty Treatments task was less impressive - as the industry expert in cosmetics, she advised Zoe Beresford on key decisions at the start of the task, but was blamed for a massive overspend on products that left the team with a small profit. While Lord Sugar criticised this mistake, Susan was visibly angered by Zoe's attitude, particularly during the task when Zoe confronted her about the excess stock, which Susan saw as an attempt to make her a scapegoat. Tensions rose again in week 6 on the Rubbish task, as Zoe dismissed Susan's suggestion to secure clients set up by Lord Sugar for waste disposal by paying a small fee for valuable scrap, and insisted on charging for the team's services. Susan was vindicated when both clients opted for the deals offered by Logic, and Venture lost the task as a result. Zoe brought Susan into the boardroom for being a weak contributor and an annoying presence, but Susan acquitted herself well, and although she interrupted Lord Sugar's deliberations, she escaped with only a warning.\n\nSusan was brought into the boardroom again the following week, this time by Jim Eastwood after the magazine task, and was branded the \"mouse\" of team Venture due to her consistent failure to make herself heard. She responded with an impassioned defence, and survived while Glenn Ward was fired. In week 8, she took on the role of project manager again to sell English products in Paris, and despite some rather bizarre questions about the French, made good choices with her products, while Helen Milligan secured a huge order from a major retailer, achieving the largest Apprentice victory in terms of cash margin at the time.\n\nIn the final, Susan offered up the best overall business plan of the four finalists, but was let down by her boasts about how much money could be generated in the first few years. Deciding that Susan needed more experience in the world of business, Lord Sugar fired her, along with fellow contestants Helen Milligan and Jim Eastwood, as inventor Tom Pellereau went on to win the series. In \"You're Hired!\", Lord Sugar said that he had always wished to be associated with skin care business, and that with Tom's nail filer on board, he would keep in touch with Susan to assemble a team.\n\nHelen was born in Stockport, Greater Manchester in October 1980. Following a degree from De Montfort University in Law (2:1), Helen worked as a Business Development Support Manager at BB's Coffee and Muffins. Most recently she has acted as an executive assistant to the CEO following a spell as a regional manager for Gregg's in the Midlands. Helen holds the record for the highest number of successive \"Apprentice\" wins; she was on the winning team for the first nine tasks before losing in Week 10. Previously, the record was held by James Max and Tre Azam, who won six consecutive tasks in Series 1 and 3 respectively. She also holds the record for the best performance in the series (10-1 win/lose ratio) and holds the joint record for success a project manager 3-0, with series five winner Yasmina Siadatan. In addition, she made the most money during the programme than anyone else, breaking the record for the most money ever won on a task in Week 8, and then breaking her own record again in Week 9. She was the Runner-Up of series 7 of the show.\nShe has now been promoted by Greggs to Head Of Retail in the South East.\n\nTom was educated at Twyford School, a co-educational independent school in the village of Twyford in Hampshire, before moving to St Edward's School, Oxford aged 13. He achieved a 1st class degree as well as a masters in Mechanical Engineering and Innovation from the University of Bath. His ambition has always been to be an inventor and this is reflected by his continued approach to product development. Some of his inventions to date have included: the Stylfile (a curved nail file), an Ethical Goods brand that connects brands with relevant charities, Mode Diagnostics (bowel cancer screening tool), Babisil (first collapsible silicon baby bottle) and the Amadeus acoustic screen for musicians.\n\nTom remained on team Logic for the entire series, and thus gained a win:loss ratio of 3:8, the worst of any UK Apprentice winner. In the first 5 weeks, where he lost every task, he gained a reputation for being a \"hindsight man\" and alongside fellow contestant Jim Eastwood, his strategy of getting out of the last three for the first five weeks during Logic's losing streak was discussed on the spin-off special \"How to Get Hired\"; there were several occasions where he identified key flaws in the team strategy, but lacked the force of character to persuade his fellow candidates to change course. A notable example was in the advertising task, when Tom unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Vincent Disneur and Jim Eastwood that their branding choice would make the product unsellable; Vincent was subsequently fired, while Jim had a narrow escape. Tom was later elected as Project Manager to sell in France, and although his instincts about the products were correct, he was persuaded otherwise by Melody Hossaini, and Logic suffered a catastrophic loss. Tom only avoided firing because Leon Doyle had even less presence in the team than he did. He then had another close call in Week 9, where his biscuit design was universally panned and earned no orders whatsoever. However, his third boardroom appearance happened more by default; Tom was responsible for half of Logic's revenue, while Melody and Helen Milligan had pursued a totally unsustainable strategy that saw them lose despite Venture earning a considerable fine.\n\nIn the final of the series, Tom came under fire for his poorly written up business plan for office equipment for back problems, but was praised for his creativity and business experience. He was subsequently declared the winner of The Apprentice from series seven. Although Tom won the series, Sugar rejected the initial business plan and instead encouraged him to expand the Stylfile into a range of grooming products.\n\nBorn in Bradford, Yorks, Ellie is the co-founder and managing director of Shipley-based recruitment firm A&E Construction. She graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in 1999 with a degree in psychology. She is a keen golfer and is a dog-owner. Ellie was fired on the fifth episode of the show, in a double-firing with Vincent. A survivor of cervical cancer, Ellie campaigns for women to undergo regular smear tests and has established her own consultancy firm to encourage young people into business careers.\n\nNatasha Scribbins was educated at The Richard Huish in Taunton Somerset, before completing her degree at Bournemouth University in the UK. Natasha has a strong career in the recruitment and staffing industry having worked for global organisations such as Hays and Randstad. Natasha specializes in Oil, Gas and Chemical markets and lives and works in the major oil and gas hub, Houston, Texas, USA. She was fired in week 11 of the series, after winning two tasks as Project Manager.\n\nSenior Design Engineer Glenn, from Hertfordshire, is a keen amateur footballer who cites Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as his inspiration. He was fired in Week 7, when his 'Hip Replacement' magazine met with heavy criticism.\n\nGavin was fired on the third episode of the show. He originates from Liverpool, and runs his own opticians.\n"}

Brookes originally auditioned for the third season of \"The X Factor\" in 2011, but was eliminated during the bootcamp round to Johnny Ruffo. He stated that his \"failure\" to make it past bootcamp inspired him to audition again. Brookes cites Usher and Drake as his musical influences.\n\nOn 20 September 2012, the Seven Network issued a statement saying that Brookes had been disqualified from \"The X Factor\" because he had \"behaved in an inappropriate manner\" on social media. A Twitcam video that was later uploaded to YouTube displayed Brookes and fellow contestant Adil Memon asking teenage girls for \"sneaky banana pics\", a phrase used by teenagers that means naked images. The Seven Network stated, \"After a careful review of the incident, FremantleMedia Australia, producers of the program, together with Channel Seven, made a joint decision to remove him from the competition\". During the second live performance show on 25 September 2012, his mentor Mel B announced that Carmelo Munzone, who was eliminated during the home visits round, was Brookes' replacement in the live shows.\n\nAdil Memon was an 18-year-old contestant who auditioned for \"The X Factor\" singing John Mayer's \"Waiting on the World to Change\". Memon comes from a musical family; his mother is an Irish violinist, his father is of Pakistani descent and plays the drums, and his sister is also a singer.

Through born in Morocco, the Ighilhriz family originated from the Kabylie region of Algeria, whose Berber tribes had been some of the most fiercest opponents of French rule in Algeria. When hearing upon the beginning of the Algerian War on 1 November 1954, her father, who worked as a baker told her: \"It is the end of the humiliation\".\n\nStrongly anti-French, Ighilahriz joined the FLN under the codename Lila to work as a courier, smuggling information, weapons and bombs across Algiers in bread baked by her father. On 28 September 1957 while traveling with a FLN party, Ighilahriz was ambushed by the French paratroopers at Chébli, badly wounded and captured.\n\nAt the hospital, Ighilahriz was given the \"truth drug\" Pentohal to make her talk, which failed to achieve its purpose.\n\nAt which point, Ighilahriz was taken to a military prison at Paradou Hydra where a French Army captain, Jean Graziani, cut her badges, prodded her wounds with a bayonet and then raped her in her words \"with all sorts of objects\" to make her talk. For months, Ighilahriz was tortured and raped into attempts to make her reveal what she knew about the FLN before finally breaking down in December 1957, telling her captors everything she knew about the FLN. During this time, Ighilahriz was not allowed to bath and spent months covered in her own blood, excrement and urine as she was held in a tiny cell. Ighilahriz remembered: \"\"Mon urine s’infiltrait sous la bâche du lit de camp, mes excréments se mélangeaient à mes menstrues jusqu’à former une croûte puante\"” (\"My urine passed through the sheet covering the camp bed, my excrement mixed with my menstrual blood, forming a stinking crust\"). To further degrade her, Ighilahriz was forced to live completely naked during her entire time at the military prison. Ighilahriz recalled:\"I was lying naked, always naked. They would come one, two or three times daily. As soon as I heard the sound of their boots in the hallway, I began to tremble. Then time became endless. The minutes seemed like hours, and the hours like days. The hardest thing was handling the first days, to get used to the pain. Then one would be detached mentally, as if the body began to float.<br><br>Massu was brutal, awful. Bigeard was not better, but the worst was Graziani. It’s unspeakable, he was a pervert who took pleasure in torturing. It was not human. I often yelled at him: “You’re not a man if you do not finish me! ” And he answered with a sneer: “Not yet, not yet!” During these three months, I had one goal: to kill myself, but the worst suffering, is to want at all costs to erase oneself and to not find the means.\" Ighilahriz stated about Captain Jean Graziani: \"\"Mais l’essentiel de ses tortures ne s’exerçaient pas à mains nues. Il était toujours armé d’ustensiles pour s’acharner contre mon plâtre\"” (\"But he did not carry out most of his torture with his bare hands. He was always armed with implements to attack my plaster cast\").\n\nIghilahriz's family also suffered as she recalled: \"They arrested my parents and most of my siblings. My mother has undergone waterboarding for three weeks. One day, they brought before her the youngest of her nine children, my 3 years old little brother, and they hung him.\" Ighilahriz credited her survival to a doctor whom she knew only as \"Richaud\", who she called a most gentle and kind man who treated her injuries. At the time she first met \"Richard\", Ighilahriz recalled \" “\"J’étais en train de devenir folle\"” (\"I was losing my mind\"), stating the effects of torture, rape and repeated injections of the \"truth drug\" Pentohal had pushed her to brink of madness.\n\n\"Richaud\" told Ighilahriz that she reminded him of his daughter who was about her age, and to whom he was very close. \"Richaud\" played something of a surrogate father to Ighilahriz as she remembered him telling her: \"Mon petit, vous êtes bien jeune pour le maquis. Je vous en prie, laissez ça aux autres. Aux hommes, par exemple!\" (\"My child, you are too young for the resistance. I beg of you, leave that to others, to men, for example!\") The scholar Mildred Mortimer wrote that \"Richaud\" for all his tenderness and compassion towards Ighilahriz ascribed to the traditional French macho viewpoint that war was entirely for men, seeing her involvement with the FLN as something unnatural for a woman, and noted by contrast that Ighilahriz's father had encouraged his daughters to join the FLN. Mortimer also the irony that through \"Richaud\" saved Ighilahriz's life that he was a supporter of \"Algérie française\", approving of the goals through not the methods of the French Army in Algeria. \nAfter confessing, Ighilahriz was taken to France, where was held in prisons in Baumettes, La Roquette, Amiens, Fresnes, Toulouse and Bastia. In January 1962, Ighilariz escaped from prison, and was hidden by French Communists in Nice. Under the amnesty of May 1962, Ighilahriz was pardoned. Afterwards, Ighilahriz went to university where she obtained a degree in psychology. In Muslim Algeria, a woman must be a virgin in order to be married, and the subject of rape is strictly taboo, and upon Ighilahriz's return to Algeria, her mother made her promise never to speak of her ordeal lest it shame the family. After independence, the official language of Algeria became Arabic, but French remains the preferred language for the educated classes in Algeria with Algerian university students still studying all subjects except politics, theology and law in French \nwhile even today cabinet meetings in Algeria are conducted in French. One official at the Education Ministry was quoted as saying: \"Arabisation was a mistake because it was motivated by this idea of revenge against French colonialism. We shouldn’t confuse the savage, barbaric colonialism of France with the French language, which is a universal vehicle of science and culture.”\n\nIghilahriz's story was unknown until 15 June 2000 when \" Le Monde\" newspaper published an interview conducted by the journalist Florence Beaugé with her. University-educated, secular, fluent in French and very fond of quoting Victor Hugo, Ighilahriz came across in her interview with Beaugé as more French than Algerian, which helped to make her a more appealing victim to the French. Shatz noted that \"What made her interview particularly poignant was that she seemed to be moved less by rage at her jailers than by gratitude to the doctor who saved her.\" Ighilahriz stated her reason for going forward after remaining silent for decades as she was too ashamed of what had happened to her was she wanted to see \"Richaud\" one last time to thank him.\n\nIn her interview, Ighilahriz stated that both General Marcel Bigeard and General Jacques Massu had been present when she was raped and tortured. Bigeard stated in an interview that her story was a \"tissue of lies\" meant to \"destroy all that is decent in France\" and denied Richaud even existed. Massu told the French media that he was not present when Ighilahriz was tortured and raped, saying he could not remember her, but expressed \"regret\" that the paras had engaged in torture and used rape as an interrogation tool, saying that there were things that had happened in Algeria that he wished had never happened. Massu confirmed the existence of Richaud, saying that Ighilahriz must had been referring to Dr. François Richaud, who had been the doctor stationed at the prison in 1957. Dr. Richaud had died on 21 September 1997. A devout Catholic, Massu had written to Pope Pius XII in February 1957 to complain that the Catholic archbishop of Algiers was not giving his men sufficient spiritual support as they went about the business of torture, and in March 1957 his conscience was greatly eased when the Catholic chaplain attached to his unit told him that God approved of torture as the only way to defeat the FLN, who were all Muslims. After Ighilarhiz had accused him of torturing her in 2000, General Massu visited his parish priest for confession, and afterwards announced that he changed his mind about torture, saying he now believed it was not necessary to win the Battle of Algiers.\n\nAfter the interview, Ighilahriz dictated her life story to the French journalist Anne Nivat which was published in 2001 as \"Algérienne\", becoming a bestseller in France. Nivat stated about her first impression of Ighilahriz: \"Dès la première seconde où j’ai croisé son regard, j’ai cru en cette femme...Je savais qu’elle parlerait, parce qu’elle avait beaucoup à raconter et souhaitait le raconter. Je n’ai pas été déçue\" (From the moment our eyes met, I believed in this woman. . . . I knew that she would speak, because she had a lot to say and wanted to speak out. I was not disappointed). As Algeria is a Muslim nation, the subject of rape is taboo, and Mortimer wrote that it was significant that Ighilahriz's story was published in French rather than her native Berber or Arabic as the story of a Berber woman being raped is unpublishable in Algeria, even today. At the beginning of \"Algérienne\", Ighilahriz stated that her decision to go forward with her story took place over the opposition of her family, her colleagues and the Algerian government, all of whom felt that the story of a Berber woman being raped was deeply shameful. Mortimer wrote through Ighilahriz suffered terribly, the purpose of her story is more to pay tribute to Dr. Richaud rather than to express rage at her torturers and rapists.\n\nA key moment in \"Algérienne\" was when Ighilarhriz and her sister Ouardia visited the grave of Dr. Richaud to place flowers before his tombstone. On 21 September 2000, the Ighilahriz sisters and Nivat visited the tomb of Dr. Richaud, where the sisters offered him a symbolic cup of coffee as a way of thanks. The ritual performed by the Ighilariz sisters at the grave of Dr. Richaud was not Algerian at all, but rather Mexican as it is common in Mexico on 1 November, the \"Día de Muertos\" (\"Day of the Dead\"), for families to have picnics on the graves of deceased family members where drinks and food are symbolically offered to the dead. Mortimer wrote the Ighilariz sisters were nominally Muslim, but the two women chose to adopt a barely veiled pagan ritual from Mexico as a way to form a connection with the deceased Dr. Richaud. Afterwards, the Ighilahriz sisters met with Richaud's daughter to give her their thanks for her father's actions. On 31 December 2000, Ouardia Ighilahriz returned alone to Richaud's grave to place a plaque reading \"Où que tu sois, tu seras toujours parmi nous. Louisette\" (\"Wherever you are, you will always be among us. Louisette\"). Attached to the plaque was a handwritten note with a drawing of a dove carrying an olive branch reading: \"Avec toute ma gratitude.—Louisette\" (\"With all my gratitude.–Louisette\").\n\nMortimer noted that the university-educated and independent-minded Ighilahriz was fluent in French, but chose not to write down her own story, instead dictating it to Nivat, and had to be accompanied by Nivat and her sister to Dr. Richaud's tomb, which for her was evidence of the extraordinary difficult nature of Ighilahriz's experiences. Mortimer further noted how much emotional support Ighilariz drew from fellow women as her sister Ouardia and Nivat played a key role in helping her confront her past, suggesting the story of \"Algérienne\" is actually the story of three women rather than one. Mortimer commented that it was striking that it came to dealing with the memory of almost unspeakable physical and sexual abuse that besides for Dr. Richuad, all of the emotional support that Ighilahriz drew upon came from other women.\n\nGeneral Maurice Schmitt of the French Army accused Ighilahriz of fabricating her entire story in a 2003 essay, making much of the fact that she described Captain Jean Graziani as having green eyes when in fact he had brown eyes. Schmitt stated that he served alongside Grazinai in Vietnam, and called him a passionate French patriot from Corsica, whom he described as incapable of committing the acts that Ighilahriz accused him of. The Canadian historian Barnett Singer came to Bigeard's defense, writing that Ighilahriz was a terrorist whose account was full of \"fabrications\" and Bigeard was off hunting the FLN in the \"bled\" at the time she was held by the 10th Parachute Division in late 1957. More controversy has centered over the fact that in the first edition of \"Algérienne\", Ighilahriz denied being raped, saying “\"Il ne pouvait pas non plus me violer, j’étais trop dégueulasse\"!\" (\"He couldn’t think of raping me. I was too disgusting!\"), but testified at the civil trial of General Schmitt that she had been raped. Mortimer defended Ighilariz under the grounds that given her background in Berber culture where it is considered deeply shameful for an unmarried not to be a virgin that it was natural that she would not want to discuss being raped. \n\nRather more unexpectedly, Saadi Yacef, a leading FLN terrorist who is currently a senator in Algeria, attacked Ighilahriz in 2011, claiming she was never a member of the FLN and lied about being raped, stating she is \"excellent dans l'art de faire de la comédie\". In response to Schmidt, Ighilariz stated that after the passage of almost 50 years, she may have misremembered small details and the way in which Schmidt obsessively tried to discredit her over small mistakes suggested the French Army on an institutional level was still not willing to admit that it engaged in torture and rape during the Algerian War. In response to Yacef, Ighilariz accused him of breaking under torture when he was captured by the French and stated that as a Berber Muslim man, he was angry at her for breaking the taboo surrounding rape in Berber culture. Ighilariz also suggested that Yacef was jealous of the way that her story had come to overshadow his in the popular memory of the Algerian War. Finally, Ighilariz wrote that it was time for the story of the Algerian War to be written in Algeria by professional historians instead of the current situation where the FLN government dictated to historians a version of history that glorified the FLN.\n\nThe British historian Martin Thomas wrote that Ighilahriz's interview and her book generated a major \"media storm\" in France in 2000-2001 as her account of physical and sexual abuse while in the custody for three months in late 1957 of the 10th Paratroop Division resonated with the French people, making her into the face of victims of torture in Algeria. Thomas further noted that at the same time that \"Algérienne\" was a bestseller, another book about the Algerian War, namely \"Services spéciaux Algérie 1955-1957\" by General Paul Aussaresses, was an even bigger bestseller in France. Thomas also noted that \"Services spéciaux Algérie 1955-1957\" was translated into English as \"The Battle of the Casbah: Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism in Algeria, 1955-1957\" while \"Algérienne\" still awaits its translation.\n\nThomas argued many people even today in the West still attach greater value to the lives of Westerners over non-Westerners, which explains why a book by a Frenchman, Aussaresses, describing and justifying torture as a legitimate counter-terrorism tactic in the Battle of Algiers attracts more attention and better sales than does a book by an Algerian woman describing her experiences of the said torture that Aussaresses ordered. Along the same lines, Thomas noted in regards to the Kenya Emergency, most people in Britain know of the 32 British settlers killed by the Mau Mau, but very few until recently have been aware of the thousands of Kikuyu killed by British security forces, suggesting there is a certain willful imperial amnesia in both France and Britain.\n"}

In April 1988, he became a minister - the chairman of the legislative committee. During the Velvet Revolution, on 10 December 1989, he was appointed Prime Minister in place of discredited Ladislav Adamec. Although he himself was a member of the KSČ, this government had a non-Communist majority. He thus headed the first cabinet in 41 years that was not dominated by the KSČ. When President Gustáv Husák resigned from his office shortly after swearing in the government, Čalfa also took on most presidential duties until the election of Václav Havel on 29 December.\n\nOn 18 January 1990, he left the KSČ to join the Public Against Violence (VPN) party, the Slovak counterpart of Havel's Civic Forum. He thus became the first prime minister since before World War II who was not a Communist or a fellow traveler. The only non-Communist to hold the premiership before the start of Communist rule, Social Democrat Zdeněk Fierlinger, was openly pro-Communist (and later led his party into a merger with the Communists). He helped lead the Havel movement to a sweeping victory in the 1990 elections--the first free elections held in the country in 44 years. When VPN dissolved in April 1991, Čalfa followed most of the party into the Civic Democratic Union (ODU-VPN), of which he became a leading member.\n\nBoth cabinets headed by Čalfa succeeded in introducing significant political and economic reforms, facilitating the transition from Communism Party rule to a multi-party system and a market-oriented economy. Čalfa enjoyed strong support from all relevant political powers, including both President Václav Havel and an increasingly confident Finance Minister Václav Klaus.\n\nČalfa resigned from the Federal Government after the defeat of the Public Against Violence in the elections of 1992. He was succeeded by caretaker Jan Stráský, whose major task was the execution of Dissolution of Czechoslovakia. In that year, Čalfa took up Czech citizenship and started working as a lawyer in Prague, heading law firm Čalfa, Bartošík a Partneři.\n\nDuring his tenure as Prime Minister, Čalfa was occasionally a target of criticism for his Communist past. Some considered this as a proof that the Velvet Revolution was unfinished or even \"stolen\" by people belonging to the past nomenklatura. Presently, historians consider him as a \"power behind the throne,\" who greatly contributed to the smoothness and speed of Velvet Revolution and the election of Václav Havel as President. He used his negotiation skills in critical moments against his fellow Communist Party members and talked them into compromises that were sometimes more radical the representatives of the Civic Forum had expected.\n\nMany politicians of the subsequent democratic era, including Václav Klaus, said that they learned many things about real politics from Čalfa.\n\n"}

In her later years she published a volume of poetry and two volumes of essays, all dealing with feminist themes. Two of her books were published in four editions during the last ten years of her life. Her poetry on the subject of human relationships and reactions has appeared in several anthologies. Her feminist essays are still in print.\n\nMary Lee was born in Winslade, Devon, in August 1656, the daughter of Richard Lee and Mary Sydenham of Westminster. She was baptized in Cyst St. George, Devon parish on 19 August 1656. She was the oldest of three siblings. Her mother's family was the distinguished Sydenham family of Wynfold Eagle, Dorset. Lady Mary's uncle Colonel William Sydenham served on fought in the English Civil War on the side of Parliament; her other uncle, Dr. Thomas Sydenham was well known for his study of epidemic diseases and doctor to Anne Finch, Vicountess Conway. Her father was a man of property and included \"esq\" after his name.\n\nShe married Sir George Chudleigh, 3rd Baronet (died 1718) of Ashton, Devon on 25 March 1674. Her biographers argue as to whether their marriage was happy; her references to marriage as a trap that was psychologically stifling for women suggest that she may have had personal experience with an overbearing \nhusband, but on the other hand, he did allow her to publish several feminist works during his lifetime, and her previously unpublished work was saved carefully by the family after her death. They had at least six children, including: \nLike most women of her time, she received little in the way of formal education, but read widely and educated herself in theology, science, and philosophy. Little else is known about her life except that one of her daughters must have died young, as her grief is mentioned in her letters and some poetry. Mary Chudleigh died on 15 December 1710 from severe rheumatism.\n\nCritics have tended to read Chudleigh's work biographically; however that began to change by the 1990s as new evidence about her life was uncovered. In her early career she could be described as a Restoration poet of lyrics and satires while in her later career she became a philosophical essayist.\n\nHeavily influenced by Mary Astell, Lady Mary Chudleigh was one of the first English women to recognize that as a social group, women faced unique challenges. She wrote overtly feminist works and argued strongly for marriage reform and women's education, believing that women should cultivate reason, virtue and stoic integrity despite living in a world full of misogyny.

{"id": "53038680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53038680", "title": "Maymie de Mena", "text": "Maymie de Mena\n\nMaymie de Mena (December 10, 1879 – October 23, 1953, also known as Maymie Aiken or Madame DeMena Aiken in her later career) was an American-born activist who became one of the highest-ranking officers in the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). She has been credited with keeping the organization alive after Marcus Garvey's conviction for mail fraud and deportation from the United States.\n\nDe Mena was born into a Creole family in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, and obtained her education in the United States before marrying a Nicaraguan and moving to Central America. After a decade in which she raised a daughter and taught school, she divorced, returned to the U.S., and joined the UNIA. Quickly rising in the ranks from a translator, because she was fluent in Spanish, de Mena became one of the leaders of the pan-African movement. She was responsible for increasing the membership of the organization in the Caribbean and Latin America. When Garvey left the U.S. and relocated to Jamaica, de Mena became Garvey's official representative in New York and was the first woman to carry such a high distinction in the organization.\n\nAfter Garvey moved to London, de Mena, now remarried and styling herself as \"Madame Aiken\", directed her attentions to women's and children's issues in Jamaica. She fought for women's suffrage and birth control rights, while establishing trade organizations to assist working-class women in improving their economic status.\n\nLeonie Turpeau was born on December 10, 1879, on a farm on the eastern banks of Bayou Teche near St. Martinville, St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, to Isabella Hill (née Regis or Reggis) and Michel Turpeau Jr. Her paternal grandfather, Michel Turpeau Sr. was a free man of color from Martinique who had worked as a ship hand and later on the Banker plantation, enabling him to buy a small parcel of land and bring his French Guianese wife, Odeline \"Dina\", to Louisiana. Turpaeu's mother was the daughter of Maturin Regis, who had been a slave in Virginia, and Carrie Hill a Louisiana Creole woman. The marriage between Michael Jr. and Isabella caused disquiet from its beginnings, as Louisiana society typically did not approve of freedmen marrying former slaves.\n\nTurpeau was the seventh sibling in the family. Her biography in the Garvey collection shows that she was privately educated and also studied at the Metropolitan Business College of New York City, the Greensboro Commercial College at Greensboro, North Carolina and at the University of New Orleans. The University of New Orleans was not founded until 1956, but Carrie, Turpeau's older sister studied at the Gilbert Academy, an agricultural/industrial college founded for freedmen which later became part of the distinct New Orleans University. Records of the university show three alumni between 1895 and 1917 with the surname Turpeau: Carrie B. who graduated in 1899, Angella (a younger sister) who graduated in 1906 both from the College of Liberal Arts, and Mary L. (née Turpeau) Thompson, later Hammett who graduated in 1899 from the normal school. Both Carrie and Mary L. Turpeau were from St. Martinville.\n\nReconstruction and rioting, coupled with the implementation of Jim Crow laws in Louisiana led most of the Turpeau family to leave the area and become professionals in the north. David DeWitt became a well-known preacher and a member of the Ohio House of Representatives and his daughter, Leontine T. Kelly born in Washington, D.C. was the first black woman bishop of the United Methodist Church. George remained in Louisiana, living in Lake Charles, which was very near Jennings, the destination of several of Turpeau's future trips from Nicaragua.\n\nTurpeau, rather than moving north, chose to go south to Bluefields, Nicaragua, with her new husband Francisco Hiberto Mena (aka Francis or Frank in English sources), a Creole planter, activist, and newspaperman. When or where they met or married is unknown. On May 12, 1912, Maymie Leona Turpeau de Mena, as she now styled herself, sailed on the \"S.S. Dictator\" from Bluefields, to New Orleans. Her passenger record showed she was heading to visit her sister in Jennings, Louisiana, was born in St. Martinville, and stated her nationality was \"Nicaraguan by marriage\". By the time de Mena arrived in Bluefields, the Mosquito Coast had transitioned from a British protectorate to a Nicaraguan capital city of the Zelaya Department with strong commercial ties to the United States. The society was quite stratified with white North Americans at the highest social positions followed by Mestizos and upper class Creoles, European mixed-race elites. Those with darker skins from Asia, the Caribbean, and indigenous people held lower status. Though de Mena styled herself as Spanish American, she would have been considered as part of the Afro-Caribbean diaspora.\n\nAt the time de Mena married Francisco Mena, U.S. law held that she lost her American citizenship and acquired her husband's. Until the Cable Act was passed in 1922, she would not have been able to reacquire American citizenship. Thus, her statements that she was \"Nicaraguan by marriage\" were accurate, unless she had petitioned the Naturalization Bureau to regain her citizenship. Since she used her Nicaraguan passport in 1926 to attain a Pullman berth, she had not re-nationalized at that time. In 1936, another U.S. law was passed which allowed women who had lost their citizenship by marrying a foreigner between 1907 and 1922 to forgo a petition of naturalization, only if their spouse had died or the couple had divorced and if the woman was willing to swear an oath of allegiance. But by this time, de Mena had already married a Cameroonian and a Jamaican. Though French law, under whose jurisdiction part of Cameroon fell, was amended in 1927 to allow women to maintain their citizenship upon marriage, the laws of Nicaragua and Britain, under whose jurisdiction both the remainder of Cameroon and Jamaica fell, still held in 1933 that a woman lost her citizenship upon remarriage and became an alien with the citizenship of her spouse.\n\nThough not native to Nicaragua, having lived in the stratified social order of a Hispanic country, de Mena was able to empathize with Afro-Latina discontent in her travels through Latin America for UNIA and she spoke their language. De Mena's identity shifted as needed. When she was denied a berth on a Pullman car, de Mena used her Nicaraguan passport to gain one. On ship passenger manifests, she claimed to be African, colored, Negro, Spanish American, West Indian, and white on various voyages and was known to travel on both a Nicaraguan and British passport. On the other hand some men in the UNIA challenged her leadership as a foreigner. She was also investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for her activities and relationships with foreigners. De Mena, dedicated to the cause of improving her race, used her shifting identity for political expediency. Natanya Duncan, even observed that she chose her husbands based on whether they could advance the cause of racial improvement and disposed of them when they became either a liability or did not support her aims.\n\nWhile de Mena may have been involved with the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in Bluefields, as she later claimed, there is no documentation confirming her participation in the organization in Nicaragua. UNIA, founded by Marcus Garvey in 1914, was a Pan-African movement with the dual goals of bringing self-authority to black people worldwide and taking possession of Africa as a Negro right. De Mena's husband was a member of the Union Club, serving as its vice president for several terms in the 1920s, which would have granted her access to the Creole elite circles. He also was involved with the \"Bluefields Weekly\", a local English-language newspaper. Both served as mechanisms for political mobilization of the Creole populations and though women were not allowed to be members of the club, they were active in organizing political influence. In 1913, de Mena listed her occupation on a trip home as nurse but in the four following years, she styled herself as a housewife. She also made a trip that year to Panama, to give birth to her daughter Berniza I. Mena who was born in Panama City on February 26, 1913. In 1917, de Mena showed her occupation as clerk and in 1919 \"La Información\" newspaper ran an advertisement for a school run by de Mena in which she taught English, French, bookkeeping, music, shorthand and typing. In 1922, de Mena returned to the United States with her daughter. The passenger manifest showed she was divorced. She would settle near her family members in Chicago.\n\nAround the time that de Mena returned to the U.S., a convention was taking place at Liberty Hall, the headquarters of UNIA in Harlem. The organization's structure was patriarchal, with clear delineation of gendered roles. Women were meant to be virtuous married mothers, in need of protection and men their gallant protectors and warriors. Though not on the 1922 agenda, the women's delegation raised a set of resolutions hoping to gain more autonomy, leadership positions and authority without male oversight. Marcus Garvey amended the resolutions so that they had little real effect, but the event marked a turning point and a rise in women in leadership in the organization. By 1929 though the organization was in decline, 39.5% of the delegates were women, rising to 49.1% in 1938. In various ways, women begin to split with the UNIA philosophies on issues that they felt strongly about, such as a woman's right to control her own child-bearing and use of birth control, as well as women's opposition to their lack of political power. De Mena's leadership of the UNIA, as a single mother, \"proved that [women] were intellectually equipped to be local leaders as well as transnational policy makers within the organization\". Soon after the convention, Garvey was arrested on charges of mail fraud involving the Black Star Line's scheme to bring American Negros \"home\" to Liberia. He was imprisoned and given a five-year sentence, but appealed his conviction and was released on bond.\n\nDe Mena joined the UNIA in Chicago and in 1924 was sent as a delegate to the annual convention in Harlem. At the convention, she asked the leadership to recognize the Daughters of Ethiopia, an honorary group making contributions to racial improvement, as an official auxiliary of the UNIA. By gaining the organization's approval, women members of the UNIA gained recognition of their contributions. In 1925, Henrietta Vinton Davis organized a tour of the Caribbean and was accompanied by de Mena, who was to serve as both translator and organizer on the trip. De Mena proved successful in both fund raising and recruiting new members, and her language skills with Spanish were rewarded with a higher salary than Davis'. By the time the women returned, now enjoying a reputation as a motivational speaker, de Mena was asked to join Garvey on stage on July 5, 1925, to call for unity. Garvey lost his appeal on his fraud case that same year and was remanded to the Atlanta Penitentiary. Throughout the summer and fall of that year, de Mena accompanied Amy Jacques-Garvey on a speaking tour covering many major cities in the Midwest, along the Atlantic coast and to New Orleans. The tour solidified her place in Garvey's inner circle. At the emergency convention of 1926, de Mena was elected as assistant international organizer and the following year succeeded Davis as the fourth vice president general, becoming Garvey's official representative. She kept in close contact with him both through correspondence and visits despite her travel schedule. Upon Garvey's release from prison in 1927 and his deportation to Jamaica, de Mena led a celebratory UNIA parade through Kingston. Perched on a horse and brandishing a sword, she was a visible symbol of the crusading woman.\n\nIn 1928, de Mena married a Cameroonian medical student, Milton Tube Ebimber, who had studied in Germany, Japan and China and spoke several African, Asian, and European languages. He was studying medicine at Columbia University when they married. Their opulent wedding, in which the bride was given away by her brother, David DeWitt Turpeau, was held at UNIA's Liberty Hall headquarters attracting wide coverage in the black newspapers. Soon after the marriage, Ebimber was arrested and imprisoned in the New York State Penitentiary on charges of bigamy. In 1929, she once again used de Mena as her surname. Beginning in 1928 and until her shift to Father Divine's movement, de Mena was the most visible officer in the UNIA. She was the key to increasing membership in the organization in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and southern American regions. When Garvey reorganized the movement in 1929, she became the international organizer and the officer in charge of the Americas. She was seated on the dais at the convention that year and on its conclusion returned to the United States as its official representative. The following year, Garvey appointed de Mena officer-in-charge of North America and his personal representative in the U.S., as he had formally split with UNIA, Inc. in New York and created the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League of the World operating out of Jamaica. De Mena's \"forceful, riveting and entrancing style\" played a key role in keeping the movement alive after Garvey's deportation from the U.S. When Davis left the movement in 1931, de Mena became the sole leader, though many challenged her authority. Around the same time, de Mena reorganized the Costa Rican Port Limón branch of the UNIA, after factionalism had created a local branch which vied for authority with the parent organization.\n\nAs director of the UNIA's newspaper \"Negro World\" from 1932, de Mena worked with Jacques-Garvey to create a ladies' page, breaking new ground at the time. Jacques-Garvey had introduced \"Our Women and What They Think\", with articles focused on women's activism, rather than on fashion or household tips. They used the voice of the \"Negro World\" to give members of the African diaspora a different narrative than the racially inferior images commonly presented in the press. In the racially charged environment of the 1930s, black women were often depicted as sexually immoral. Through the ladies' page articles, women were encouraged to uplift the race through motherhood; the articles helped to change the perception of Afro-Caribbean women by asserting the women's respectability. In Costa Rica, where they had been denied citizenship, West Indian women argued that they were fit to become citizens. Chapters of UNIA sprang up in countries from Brazil through Mexico and across the West Indies. Though Caribbean migrants to the areas accounted for some of the membership, not all of those interested in Garveyism were immigrants from the West Indies. The \"Negro World\" had a Spanish section which ran news about issues affecting Afro-Latinos. Under de Mena's leadership it was decidedly feminist. She exhorted members to fight for women's rights and throw off the restrictions of assigned roles.\n\nOn 11 June 1932, de Mena married Percy Aiken, a Jamaican contractor and activist, who would become an officer in the island's Bahá'í Faith. Garvey tried to bring the UNIA back to its former status from Jamaica, continuing to write articles for the \"Negro World\" and developing two other short-lived papers, \"The Blackman\" and \"The New Jamaican\", but all had folded by 1933. In 1934, now adopting her new husband's surname and styled as \"Madame Aiken\" she began a newspaper using the presses of the \"Negro World\" called the \"World Echo\". While the paper ostensibly was to be another organ for UNIA, many of the articles were devoted to Father Divine's Peace Mission. Aiken used the paper to call for anti-lynching legislation and championed African-American civil rights, including liberation in \"spiritual, economic, political and industrial emancipation\". Father Divine's movement was in direct opposition to Garvey's, in that Garvey pressed for racial consciousness and purity, while Divine argued that race was unimportant and that blacks had to integrate into the larger society. The opposing voices of these two movements were difficult for Aiken and other members of the diaspora to reconcile. She finally closed both the newspaper and UNIA's offices in New York, moving to Jamaica in 1935. Though she continued some involvement with UNIA through the 1950s, the organization was in decline. Garvey's financial problems resulted in the foreclosure of his home, and by 1935, he permanently relocated to London. Around the same time, Aiken withdrew her support from Father Divine and restyled the \"World Echo\" into the \"Ethiopian World\". Though many deserted Garvey, Aiken maintained a good relationship with him until his death.\n\nAiken was increasingly involved in social work, joining the Women's Liberal Club and the Trade Unions Council. She supported a variety of causes including the improvement of conditions for children and orphans, hygiene and licensing regulations for beauticians, care facilities for the elderly, better schools, and controlling government waste. Aiken served as Secretary of the Save the Children organization and was a member of its executive board up to her death. She was also involved in the birth control movement alongside other reformers like Amy Bailey and May Farquharson. She believed that until women could plan the size of their own families, they would not be able to improve the economic, educational, or moral status of the black community as they would be unable to devote quality support to large numbers of children. She joined the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and though the organization largely excluded women, she pressed for social and economic improvements for women. Aiken also helped establish a trade union for seamstresses, co-founded the Housecraft Training Center and was the only woman to serve on the Trade Unions Council.\n\nIn 1939, when Mary Morris Knibb launched her bid for a seat on the Kingston/Saint Andrew Parish Council, Aiken was a staunch supporter and campaigner. Upon Knibb's victory, Aiken rallied UNIA and other organizations for a victory celebration for the first woman elected to any political office in Jamaica. That same year, she made a trip back to the U.S., in part to console one of her sisters who was ailing, but also to visit the Birth Control Research Bureau, attend lectures at Howard University and participate in roundtable discussions with the National Woman's Party. When Garvey died in 1940 and the following year the Commissioner of the UNIA in Jamaica resigned, Aiken was put forward as a replacement. She continued to press for women's political participation, entering the local elections herself in 1947. Though she did not win, she encouraged others to vote for women candidates.\n\nIn 1949, Aiken became president of the Garvey Division of the UNIA and served in that capacity until her resignation in July of the following year. She was finally appointed by UNIA Inc. in New York as the Commissioner for Cuba, Central America and Jamaica in 1952. She was the current president of the Women's Liberal Club when she boarded a ship in September 1953 to see a doctor in the U.S.\n\nAiken died on October 23, 1953, from cancer and was buried in the Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. The year after Aiken's death, a portrait of her was unveiled by Lady Foot, wife of Governor Foot and donated to the Housecraft Training Center, a facility co-founded by Aiken to teach domestic science.\n\n"}

{"id": "25692267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25692267", "title": "Michael Flynn", "text": "Michael Flynn\n\nMichael Thomas Flynn (born December 1958) is a retired United States Army Lieutenant General who served in the U.S. Army for 33 years, from 1981 until 2014. In January 2017 he briefly served as National Security Advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump. In December 2017 he pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI (a felony) about contacts he had with the Russian government during Trump's presidential transition.\n\nFlynn's military career included a key role in shaping U.S. counterterrorism strategy and dismantling insurgent networks in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he was given numerous combat arms, conventional, and special operations senior intelligence assignments.\n\nHe was appointed by President Barack Obama as the eighteenth director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, serving from July 2012 until his forced retirement from the military in August 2014. \"The New York Times\" reported on May 18, 2018, that a longtime FBI/CIA informant had met Flynn at an intelligence seminar in Britain six months earlier and became alarmed by Flynn's closeness to a Russian woman there; this concern prompted another individual to alert American authorities that Flynn may have been compromised by Russian intelligence.\n\nAfter leaving the military, he established Flynn Intel Group, which has provided intelligence services for businesses and governments, including ones in Turkey.\n\nFlynn briefly served as the National Security Advisor for President Donald Trump, from January 20 to February 13, 2017. He resigned after information surfaced that he had misled the FBI and Vice President Mike Pence about the nature and content of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. Flynn's tenure of just 24 days was the shortest in the office's history.\n\nOn April 27, 2017, the Pentagon inspector general announced an investigation into whether Flynn had accepted money from foreign governments without the required approval. Flynn initially refused to hand over subpoenaed documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee, pleading the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, but a compromise with the committee was worked out. On December 1, 2017, Flynn appeared in federal court to formalize a deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to plead guilty to a single felony count of \"willfully and knowingly\" making \"false, fictitious and fraudulent statements\" to the FBI. He confirmed his intention to cooperate with the Special Counsel's investigation.\n\nMichael Thomas Flynn was born and raised in Middletown, Rhode Island, as one of nine children to Helen Frances (Andrews), who worked in real estate, and Charles Francis Flynn, a small-town banker. Both of his parents are of Irish descent.\n\nMichael Flynn graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a Bachelor of Science degree in management science in 1981 and was a Distinguished Military Graduate of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. He also earned a Master of Business Administration in Telecommunications from Golden Gate University, a Master of Military Art and Science from the United States Army Command and General Staff College, and a Master of Arts in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College.\n\nFlynn is a graduate of the Military Intelligence Officer Basic Course, Ranger School, Military Intelligence Officer Advanced Course, Army Command and General Staff College, the School of Advanced Military Studies, and Naval War College.\n\nFlynn was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant in military intelligence in 1981. His military assignments included multiple tours at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, with the 82nd Airborne Division, XVIII Airborne Corps, and Joint Special Operations Command, where he deployed for the invasion of Grenada and Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. He also served with the 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, at the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.\n\nFlynn served as the assistant chief of staff, G2, XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from June 2001 and the director of intelligence at the Joint Task Force 180 in Afghanistan until July 2002. He commanded the 111th Military Intelligence Brigade from June 2002 to June 2004 and was the director of intelligence for Joint Special Operations Command from July 2004 to June 2007, with service in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) and the Iraq War (Operation Iraqi Freedom). He served as the director of intelligence of the United States Central Command from June 2007 to July 2008, as the director of intelligence of the Joint Staff from July 2008 to June 2009, then the director of intelligence of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan from June 2009 to October 2010.\n\nIn September 2011, Flynn was promoted to Lieutenant General and assigned as assistant director of national intelligence in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. On April 17, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Flynn to be the 18th director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn took command of the DIA in July 2012. He simultaneously became commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and chair of the Military Intelligence Board.\n\nIn October 2012, Flynn announced plans to release his paper \"VISION2020: Accelerating Change Through Integration\", a look at changes he believes are necessary for the DIA in the future.\n\nIn June 2013, Michael Flynn became the first U.S. officer to be allowed inside the Russian military intelligence (GRU) headquarters in Moscow, where he arrived at the invitation of the GRU chief Gen Igor Sergun. His follow-up trip to visit the GRU HQ as Director of DIA was not allowed.\n\nOn April 30, 2014, Flynn announced his retirement effective later that year, about a year earlier than he had been scheduled to leave his position. He was reportedly effectively forced out of the DIA after clashing with superiors over his allegedly chaotic management style and vision for the agency. In a private e-mail that was leaked online, Colin Powell said that he had heard in the DIA (apparently from later DIA director Vincent R. Stewart) that Flynn was fired because he was \"abusive with staff, didn't listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc.\" According to \"The New York Times\", Flynn exhibited a loose relationship with the truth, leading his subordinates to refer to Flynn's repeated dubious assertions as \"Flynn facts\".\n\nAccording to what Flynn had stated in one final interview as DIA director, he felt like a lone voice in thinking that the United States was less safe from the threat of Islamic terrorism in 2014 than it was prior to the 9/11 attacks; he went on to believe that he was pressed into retirement for questioning the Obama administration's public narrative that Al Qaeda was close to defeat. Journalist Seymour Hersh wrote that \"Flynn confirmed [to Hersh] that his agency had sent a constant stream of classified warnings ... about the dire consequences of toppling [Syrian President] Assad.\" Flynn recounted that his agency was producing intelligence reports indicating that radical Islamists were the main force in the Syrian insurgency and \"that Turkey was looking the other way when it came to the growth of the Islamic State inside Syria\". According to Flynn, these reports \"got enormous pushback from the Obama administration,\" who he felt \"did not want to hear the truth\". According to former DIA official W. Patrick Lang: \"Flynn incurred the wrath of the White House by insisting on telling the truth about Syria ... they shoved him out. He wouldn't shut up.\" In an interview with Al Jazeera, Flynn criticized the Obama administration for its delay in supporting the opposition in Syria, thereby allowing for the growth of Al-Nusra and other extremist forces: \"when you don't get in and help somebody, they're gonna find other means to achieve their goals\" and that \"we should have done more earlier on in this effort, you know, than we did.\"\n\nFlynn retired from the U.S. Army with 33 years of service on August 7, 2014.\n\nFlynn, with his son Michael G. Flynn, ran the Flynn Intel Group Inc, which provided intelligence services for businesses and governments before closing in 2016. The company was founded in the fall of 2014, and restarted in June 2015 as a Delaware company.\n\nFlynn was paid over $65,000 by companies connected to Russia in 2015, including $11,250 from both Volga-Dnepr Airlines and the U.S. subsidiary of Kaspersky Lab. Other clients included Palo Alto Networks, Francisco Partners, Brainwave Science and Adobe Systems.\n\nWhile working as a consultant Flynn served on the board of several organizations, including GreenZone Systems, Patriot Capital, Brainwave, Drone Aviation and OSY Technologies. Subsidiaries of the Flynn Intel Group included FIG Cyber Inc, headed by Timothy Newberry, and FIG Aviation.\n\nIn July 2018, the consulting firm Stonington Global LLC announced that Flynn was joining the firm as its director of global strategy, though Flynn's attorneys disputed that there had ever been a partnership several hours later.\n\nIn July 2016, Flynn spoke at a meeting of ACT! for America at a point when the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was still underway. He spoke favorably of the coup participants, saying that Erdoğan had been moving Turkey away from secularism and towards Islamism and that participants in the coup wanted Turkey to be and to be seen as a secular nation—a goal \"worth clapping for.\"\n\nBy the end of September 2016, Flynn's consulting company was hired by Inovo BV, a company owned by Kamil Ekim Alptekin, the Chair of the Turkish-American Business Council, which is an arm of the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEIK).\n\nOn November 8 (election day in the United States), an op-ed written by Flynn was published by \"The Hill\", calling for U.S. backing for Erdoğan's government and criticizing the regime's opponent, Fethullah Gülen, alleging that Gülen headed a \"vast global network\" that fitted \"the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network\". At the time, Flynn did not disclose that his consulting firm had received funds from a company with ties to the Turkish government. After Flynn's ties had been disclosed by \"The Daily Caller\", Politico, and others, the editor of \"The Hill\" added a note to Flynn's op-ed, stating that Flynn had failed to disclose that he had been engaged at the time in \"consulting work that might have aided the government of Turkey,\" that his firm had received payments from a company with close ties to the Turkish government, or that the company had reviewed the draft of the op-ed before it was submitted to \"The Hill\".\n\nOn March 8, 2017, Flynn registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before election day. This work was done on behalf of a Dutch-based company that may have been working for the Turkish government.\n\nOn March 24, 2017, former Director of the CIA James Woolsey said that in September 2016 Flynn, while working for the Trump presidential campaign, had attended a meeting in a New York hotel with Turkish officials including foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and had discussed abducting Fethullah Gülen and sending him to Turkey, bypassing the U.S. extradition legal process.\n\nFlynn sat in on classified national security briefings with then-candidate Trump at the same time that Flynn was working for foreign clients, which raises ethical concerns and conflicts of interest. Flynn was paid at least $5,000 to serve as a consultant to a U.S.-Russian project to build 40 nuclear reactors across the Middle East, which Flynn's failure to disclose was flagged by Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel as a possible violation of federal law.\n\nOn December 10, 2015, Flynn attended a gala dinner in Moscow in honor of RT (formerly \"Russia Today\"), a Russian government-owned English-language media outlet, on which he made semi-regular appearances as an analyst after he retired from U.S. government service.\n\nFlynn sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the dinner, leading journalist Michael Crowley of \"Politico\" to report that \"at a moment of semi-hostility between the U.S. and Russia, the presence of such an important figure at Putin's table startled\" U.S. officials. As part of the festivities, Flynn gave a talk on world affairs for which he was paid at least $45,000. Flynn defended the RT payment in an interview with Michael Isikoff.\n\nOn February 1, 2017, the ranking Democratic members on six House committees sent a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis, requesting a Department of Defense investigation into Flynn's connection to RT. The legislators expressed concern that Flynn had violated the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution by accepting money from RT.\n\nA 2017 report by the United States Intelligence Community characterized RT as \"The Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet\" and said that RT America is set up as an autonomous nonprofit organization \"to avoid the Foreign Agents Registration Act\".\n\nAs a retired military intelligence officer, Flynn was required to obtain prior permission from the Defense Department and the State Department before receiving any money from foreign governments. Flynn apparently did not seek that approval before the RT speech, and he did not report the payment when he applied for renewal of his security clearance two months later. \nGlenn A. Fine, the acting Defense Department Inspector General, has confirmed he is investigating Flynn.\n\nHaving already been consulted regarding national security by Fiorina as well as other candidates, including Scott Walker, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump, Flynn was asked in February 2016 to serve as an adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nIn July 2016, it was reported he was being considered as Trump's running mate; Flynn later confirmed that he had submitted vetting documents to the campaign and, although a registered Democrat, was willing to accept the Republican vice-presidential nomination if chosen. However, Trump instead selected Indiana Governor Mike Pence.\n\nAs one of the keynote speakers during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention, Flynn gave what the \"Los Angeles Times\" described as a \"fiery\" speech, in which he stated: \"We are tired of Obama's empty speeches and his misguided rhetoric. This, this has caused the world to have no respect for America's word, nor does it fear our might\"; he accused Obama of choosing to conceal the actions of Osama bin Laden and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Flynn went on to criticize political correctness and joined the crowd in a chant of \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\". During the chants, he told those in the audience, \"Get fired up! This is about our country.\"\n\nDuring the speech, Flynn launched a blistering attack on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He led the crowd in chants of \"Lock her up!\"; during one of those chants, he encouraged the crowd to keep it up, saying, \"Damn right! Exactly right! There is nothing wrong with that!\" He called for Clinton to withdraw from the race, saying that \"if I did a tenth of what she did, I'd be in jail today.\" He repeated in subsequent interviews that she should be \"locked up\". While campaigning for Trump, Flynn also referred to Clinton as the \"enemy camp\". Six days after the speech, Flynn stirred up a controversy by retweeting anti-Semitic remarks, which he later apologized for and claimed were unintentional. During the election campaign, Flynn used Twitter to post links to negative stories about Clinton, like the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.\n\nFlynn was once opposed to waterboarding and other extreme interrogation techniques that have now been banned; however, according to an August 2016 \"Washington Post\" article, he said at one point, in the context of Trump's apparent openness to reinstating such techniques, that \"he would be reluctant to take options off the table.\" In May 2016, Flynn was asked by an Al Jazeera reporter if he would support Trump's stated plan to \"take out [the] families\" of people suspected of being involved in terrorism. In response, Flynn stated, \"I would have to see the circumstances of that situation.\" In an interview with \"Al Jazeera\", Flynn criticized the U.S. reliance on drones as a \"failed strategy\", stating that \"what we have is this continued investment in conflict. The more weapons we give, the more bombs we drop, that just ... fuels the conflict.\"\n\nOn November 10, 2016, President Obama warned President-elect Trump against hiring Flynn. During their meeting in the Oval Office two days after the election, Obama expressed \"profound concerns\" about hiring Flynn to a sensitive, high-level national security post.\n\nOn November 18, 2016, Flynn accepted Trump's offer for the position of National Security Advisor. Prior to his appointment, media sources including \"The Washington Post\" and Associated Press had already criticized his close relations with Russia, and his promotion of anti-Clinton conspiracy theories and fake news during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn December 2016, Flynn met with Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPA), at Trump Tower in New York. The meeting attracted attention because the FPA was founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s, and because Strache had recently signed a cooperation agreement with Vladimir Putin's ruling United Russia party. The Trump campaign refused to comment on the meeting.\n\nOn December 29, 2016, Flynn spoke with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the same day the Obama administration announced retaliatory measures in response to the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign by the Russian government. The phone conversation was reportedly viewed by Obama advisers who had been briefed on its content by the F.B.I. with suspicion as possibly a secret deal between the incoming team and Moscow, which could have violated the dormant Logan Act that bars unauthorized U.S. citizens from negotiating with foreign powers in disputes with the United States. The day after reporting by David Ignatius, Trump's incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer said the conversation had occurred on December 28 and thus couldn't have touched on the retaliation measures or Russia's response; Spicer later had to correct himself on the date of the conversation.\n\nOn January 4, 2017, Flynn informed Don McGahn, soon to become the White House Counsel, that he was under investigation over his work for Turkey. Ten days before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Flynn told then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice not to proceed with a planned invasion of Raqqa using Kurdish People's Protection Units. Flynn's decision would delay the campaign, which had taken seven months to plan, several more months, but was consistent with Turkish objections to working with Kurdish troops.\n\nActing Attorney General Sally Yates, in May 8 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, said the FBI interviewed Flynn, on January 24, 2017. Based on the results of that interview, she made an \"urgent\" request to meet with McGahn. She met with him on January 26 and again on January 27. She informed McGahn that Flynn was \"compromised\" and possibly open to blackmail by the Russians. Yates told McGahn that Flynn had misled Pence and other administration officials about the nature of his conversation with the Russian ambassador. She added that Flynn's \"underlying conduct\", which she could not describe due to classification, \"was problematic in and of itself,\" saying \"(i)t was a whole lot more than one White House official lying to another.\" Former United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called the possibility of Flynn being blackmailed \"kind of a stretch,\" while acknowledging that his false statement was \"a problem ... that I would tell the president about.\"\n\nOn January 22, 2017, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Flynn was under investigation by U.S. counterintelligence agents for his communications with Russian officials. On February 8, 2017, Flynn flatly denied having spoken to Kislyak in December 2016 about the sanctions placed on Russia by the Obama administration; however, the next day, U.S. intelligence officials shared an account indicating that such discussions did in fact take place. Following this revelation, Flynn's spokesman released a statement that Flynn \"indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn't be certain that the topic never came up\".\n\nOn February 13, 2017, Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor, following news reports about his communications with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak and additional reports that he had misled the Vice President about them. Flynn's 24-day tenure as National Security Advisor was the shortest in the 63-year history of the office. Those communications he had with the Russian ambassador were subsequently leaked to the press.\n\nCommenting on Flynn′s resignation, on February 14 White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated, \"We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, where a level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change ... The issue here was that the President got to the point where General Flynn's relationship – misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation. That's why the President decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it.\"\n\nThat same day (February 14), President Trump met with FBI Director James Comey in the Oval Office and reportedly told him \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go\" adding \"he's a good guy.\" Comey subsequently testified that, \"I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December ... I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign\". The propriety, and even the legality, of these words that Trump reportedly said to Comey about Flynn have become a subject of considerable public debate. Several months after dismissing Flynn, Trump also dismissed Comey, which Comey attributed to the FBI's Russia investigation.\n\nFlynn had offered to testify to the FBI or the Senate and House Intelligence committees relating to the Russia probe in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution. However, the Senate Intelligence Committee rejected Flynn's offer for testimony in exchange for immunity. Flynn initially declined to respond to a subpoena from the Senate Intelligence Committee, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but he and the committee later struck a compromise. The Pentagon inspector general is also investigating whether Flynn accepted money from foreign governments without the required approval.\n\nOn November 5, 2017, NBC News reported that Robert Mueller has enough evidence for charges against Flynn and his son; Michael G. Flynn. On November 10, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Flynn is under investigation by Mueller for allegedly planning a kidnapping and extrajudicial rendition of Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen to Turkey. On November 22, \"NBC News\" reported that Michael T. Flynn's business partner Bijan Kian is a subject of the Mueller probe. NBC has also reported that a Turkish businessman named Reza Zarrab, who was picked up last year by U.S. authorities in Miami on Iranian sanctions violations and money laundering charges, is offering evidence against the subject.\n\nOn November 23, 2017, it was reported that Flynn's lawyers have notified Trump's legal team they can no longer discuss anything regarding Mueller's investigation, suggesting that Flynn may be cooperating with prosecutors or negotiating a deal.\n\nOn December 1, 2017, special counsel Robert Mueller agreed to a plea bargain where Flynn pleaded guilty to \"willfully and knowingly\" making \"false, fictitious and fraudulent statements\" to the FBI regarding conversations with Russia's ambassador. Specifically, Flynn is accused of falsely claiming that he had not asked Russia's ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak on December 29, 2016, \"to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day.\" Flynn pleaded guilty the same day and acknowledged that he was cooperating with the investigation by Mueller. Flynn stated;\n\nIt has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \"treason\" and other outrageous acts...Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right.\n\n\"Bloomberg\" reporter Eli Lake wrote in an opinion piece on December 1, 2017, that two former Trump transition team officials provided information indicating that Jared Kushner was the senior member of the team described in Flynn's plea documents as having directed Flynn to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, asking them to delay or vote against a United Nations resolution on the issue of Israeli settlements, contrary to the still-incumbent Obama administration's position of support for the resolution. This was also confirmed by other news outlets, who cited multiple sources.\n\nSentencing of Flynn has been deferred several times, the last time on July 10, 2018. As part of Flynn's plea negotiations, his son, Michael G. Flynn, is not expected to be charged.\n\nFlynn is a registered Democrat, having grown up in a \"very strong Democratic family\". However, he was a keynote speaker during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention, and he was a surrogate and top national security adviser for President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring a July 10, 2016, interview on ABC News' \"This Week\", when asked by host Martha Raddatz about the issue of abortion, Flynn stated, \"women have to be able to choose.\" The next day, Flynn said on Fox News that he is a \"pro-life Democrat\".\n\nFlynn is a supporter of current Israeli policies. He is also an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal. In February 2017, Flynn said that \"the Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions – including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms\". Flynn accused Yemen's Houthi rebels of being one of Iran's \"proxy terrorist groups\" in February 2017. Flynn also criticized Obama's administration for arming Syrian rebels linked to Salafi jihadism. According to Flynn, the U.S. is \"at war with a radical component of Islam\". Flynn has been a board member of ACT! for America, and sees the Muslim faith as one of the root causes of Islamist terrorism. He has described Islam as a political ideology and a cancer. He once tweeted that \"fear of Muslims is RATIONAL\" and included a video link claiming that Islam wants \"80% of people enslaved or exterminated\". Initially supportive of Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, Flynn later told Al Jazeera that a blanket ban was unworkable and has called instead for \"vetting\" of entrants from countries like Syria. Flynn has stated the U.S. \"should extradite Fethullah Gülen\" to Turkey and \"work constructively with Russia\" in Syria. In 2016, he said that he had personally seen photos of signs in the Southwest border area that were in Arabic to help Muslims entering the United States illegally. An officer of the National Border Patrol Council responded that the organization was not aware of any such signs.\n\nFlynn co-authored a report in January 2010 through the Center for a New American Security, entitled \"Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan\". That report, which became influential, argued that U.S. intelligence agencies \"must open their doors to anyone who is willing to exchange information, including Afghans and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) as well as the US military and its allies\".\n\nFlynn is also an author of \"The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies\", co-authored with Michael Ledeen, which was published by St. Martin's Press in 2016. In reviewing the book, Will McCants of the Brookings Institution described Flynn's worldview as a confused combination of neoconservatism (an insistence on destroying what he sees as an alliance of tyranny, dictatorships, and radical Islamist regimes) and realism (support for working with \"friendly tyrants\"), although he acknowledged that this could be due to the book having two authors.\n\nLieutenant General Flynn's decorations, medals and badges include:\n\n\n\n"}

The shame brought about by accusations that he was involved in the forging of ancient biblical texts drove him to suicide in 1884. The discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls in 1947, in approximately the same area he claimed his material was discovered, has cast some doubt on the original forgery charges.\n\nMoses Wilhelm Shapira was born in 1830 to Polish-Jewish parents in Kamenets-Podolski, which at the time was part of Russian-annexed Poland (in modern-day Ukraine). Shapira's father emigrated to Ottoman Palestine and in 1856, at the age of 25, Moses Shapira followed. His grandfather, who accompanied him, died en route.\n\nOn the way, while in Bucharest, Moses Shapira converted to Christianity and applied for German citizenship. Once in Jerusalem, he joined the community of Anglican missionaries and converts and in 1861 opened a store in the Street of the Christians, today's Christian Quarter Road. He sold the usual religious souvenirs enjoyed by pilgrims, as well as ancient pots he acquired from Arab farmers.\n\nShapira became interested in biblical artifacts after the appearance of the so-called Moabite Stone, also known as the Mesha Stele. He witnessed the huge interest around it and may have had a hand in negotiating on behalf of the German representatives. France eventually got the fragments of the original stone, leaving the British and the Germans rather frustrated.\n\nThe squeeze which helped reconstruct the shattered Mesha Stele was taken on behalf of the French scholar and diplomat Charles Clermont-Ganneau by a Christian Arab painter and \"dragoman\" (tour-guide), Salim al-Khouri, better known as Salim al-Kari, \"the reader\", a nickname apparently given to him by the Bedouin due to his work with ancient alphabets. Salim soon became Shapira's associate and provided connections to Arab craftsmen who, along with Salim himself, produced for Shapira's shop large amounts of fake Moabite artifacts – large stone-made human heads, but mainly clay objects: vessels, figurines and erotic pieces, generously covered with inscriptions based chiefly on the signs Salim had copied from the Mesha Stele.\nTo modern scholars, the products seem clumsy – inscriptions do not translate to anything legible, for one – but at the time there was little with which to compare them. Shapira even organized an expedition to Moab for potential buyers, to sites where he had Salim's Bedouin associates bury more forgeries. Some scholars began to base theories on these pieces and the term Moabitica was coined for this entirely new category of \"Moabite\" artifacts.\n\nSince German archaeologists had not gained possession of the Moabite Stone, they rushed to buy the Shapira Collection ahead of their rivals. Berlin's Altes Museum bought 1700 artifacts for the cost of 22,000 thalers in 1873. Other private collectors followed suit. One of them was Horatio Kitchener, a not yet famous British lieutenant, who bought eight pieces for the Palestine Exploration Fund. Shapira was able to move to the luxurious Aga Rashid property (modern-day Ticho House), outside Jerusalem's squalid Old City, with his wife and two daughters.\n\nStill various people, including Charles Clermont-Ganneau, had their doubts. Clermont-Ganneau suspected Salim al-Kari, questioned him and in time found the man who supplied him with clay, a stonemason who worked for him, and other accomplices. He published his findings in the \"Athenaeum\" newspaper in London and declared all \"Moabitica\" to be forgeries, a conclusion with which even the German scholars eventually concurred (cf. Emil Friedrich Kautzsch and , \"Die Echtheit der moabitischen Altertümer geprüft\", 1876). Shapira defended his collection vigorously until his rivals presented more evidence against them. He placed the entire blame on Salim al-Kari, convinced almost everyone that he was just an innocent victim, and continued to do a considerable trade especially in genuine old Hebrew manuscripts from Yemen.\n\nIn 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the \"Shapira Strips\", a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The Hebrew text hinted at a different version of Deuteronomy, including a surprising eleventh commandment (\"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: I am God, thy God\"). Shapira sought to sell them to the British Museum for a million pounds, and allowed them to exhibit two of the 15 strips. The exhibition was attended by thousands.\n\nHowever, Clermont-Ganneau also attended the exhibition; Shapira had denied him access to the other 13 strips. After close examination, Clermont-Ganneau declared them to be forgeries. Soon afterward British biblical scholar Christian David Ginsburg came to the same conclusion. Later Clermont-Ganneau showed that the leather of the Deuteronomy scroll was quite possibly cut from the margin of a genuine Yemenite scroll that Shapira had previously sold to the Museum.\n\nShapira fled London in despair, his name ruined and all of his hopes crushed. Six months later, on March 9, 1884, he shot himself in Hotel Bloemendaal in Rotterdam.\n\nThe Shapira Strips disappeared and then reappeared a couple of years later in a Sotheby's auction, where they were sold for 10 guineas. In 1899 they were probably destroyed in a fire at the house of the presumed final owner, Sir Charles Nicholson.\n\nDespite the assessment of contemporary scholars - German ones from Halle, Leipzig and Berlin, Clermont-Ganneau from France, Christian David Ginsburg of London - declaring with good arguments either that the leather had only been recently processed, or that the Hebrew script and language used were flawed, and even leaving aside the fact that the peculiar \"eleventh commandment\" showed Christian leanings which could be connected to Shapira's own conversion, there have always been researchers claiming to have reasons to believe that the Deuteronomy scroll might be a genuine ancient artifact after all. The presumed but hard to prove physical loss of the strips in the 1899 fire leaves space for speculation, but none for actual research. There are no major scholars dealing with the issue currently, especially since nobody has produced any surviving fragment of the strips, the only useful facsimile being the well-known one created by Ginsburg back in 1883. The fact is also that contemporary press articles which ridiculed Shapira using anti-Semitic stereotypes did not precede, but rather followed the rejection of the scroll by a large range of scholars.\n\nShapira \"Moabitica\" fakes still exist in museums and private collections around the world but are rarely displayed. By now they have become desirable collectibles in their own right.\n\nThe exact location of Shapira's shop on Christian Quarter Road in Jerusalem has now been identified.\n\n\n"}

He made significant contributions to the design and retrofit of concrete structures, and developed the first displacement-based method of seismic design.\n\nBorn in Wellington in 1943, Priestley was educated at Wellington Technical College from 1956 to 1959. When aged 16 he began studying civil engineering at the University of Canterbury, completing a Bachelor of Engineering with first-class honours and, in 1966, a PhD. His thesis was titled \"Moment redistribution in prestressed concrete continuous beams\".\n\nFrom 1967 to 1975 Priestley was the head of the structures laboratory at the Ministry of Works and Development central laboratories in Lower Hutt, where he led structural studies of bridges and buildings. In 1976 he returned to the University of Canterbury where he was a senior lecturer and then reader in the Department of Civil Engineering. Over the next 10 years he conducted research into the seismic behaviour of masonry structures in collaboration with Tom Paulay, and reinforced concrete columns in collaboration with Bob Park. He was also the consulting proof engineer for many major rail bridges and industrial buildings in New Zealand. He served as president of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering from 1985 to 1986.\n\nPriestley was then professor of structural engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) from 1987 until 2000. During this time his research focused on the seismic design of concrete bridges. In the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake he was a member of various California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) committees and commissions reviewing the design of damaged bridges, and was also a member or chair of a number of Caltrans committees investigating the seismic strengthening of existing structures. He became professor emeritus of structural engineering at UCSD in 2001.\n\nHe co-founded the European School for Advanced Studies in Reduction of Seismic Risk (ROSE School) in Pavia, Italy, with Gian Michele Calvi, and served as its co-director from 2002 to 2008, and emeritus co-director from 2009.\n\nFollowing the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Priestley was an expert witness before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure Caused by the Canterbury Earthquakes, and chaired a panel that investigated the collapse of the CTV Building and PGC Building, and damage to the Hotel Grand Chancellor and Forsyth Barr Building.\n\nPriestley died in Christchurch of cancer on 23 December 2014.\n\nPriestley was author or co-author of over 450 scientific papers and 250 research reports, and was the primary advisor for more than 25 doctoral students. His three books:\n\nHis research at UCSD with Frieder Seible following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake into structural deficiencies in reinforced concrete columns supported bridges in California led to the development an economical retrofit solution involving the installation of a metal jacket to reduce the risk of column failure in seismic events. The method has been widely adopted, particularly on the west coast of the United States.\n\nA team led by Priestley developed PRESSS (precast seismic structural system), a design methodology for earthquake-resistant buildings in which the building is designed as a collection of rocking blocks able to move independently of each other during a seismic event but are pulled back into their original position by unbonded post-tensioning cables within the precast concrete structure.\n\nPriestley eschewed force-based design methods for earthquake-resistant buildings and developed the first method for displacement-based design, an approach that has been described as revolutionary. Traditional force-based methods could not adequately describe the expected damage, or performance, of a building subjected to seismic forces, whereas Priestley's displacement-based approach allows engineers to dictate the behaviour of a building in an earthquake.\n\nPriestley was conferred honorary doctorates by ETH Zurich and the National University of Cuyo, Argentina. He was a Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ), the American Concrete Institute (ACI), and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering. In 1999 he was elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He won over 30 national and international awards for his research and technical papers, including the Fulton Gold Medal from IPENZ in 1973, the Raymond C. Reese Award from the ACI in 1984 and 1989, and the Freyssinet Medal from the fib in 2010.\n\nIn the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours, Priestley was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to structural engineering.\n"}

{"id": "365291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365291", "title": "Oliver Sipple", "text": "Oliver Sipple\n\nOliver Wellington \"Billy\" Sipple (November 20, 1941 – February 2, 1989) was a decorated U.S. Marine and Vietnam War veteran. On September 22, 1975, he grappled with Sara Jane Moore as she fired a pistol at U.S. President Gerald Ford in San Francisco, causing her to miss. The subsequent public revelation that Sipple was gay turned the news story into a cause célèbre for LGBT rights activists, leading Sipple to unsuccessfully sue several publishers for invasion of privacy.\n\nOliver Wellington Sipple was born in Detroit, Michigan. He served in the United States Marine Corps and fought in Vietnam. Shrapnel wounds suffered in December 1968 caused him to finish out his tour of duty in a Philadelphia veterans' hospital, from which he was released in March 1970. Sipple, who was closeted in his hometown of Detroit, had met Harvey Milk in New York City and had participated in San Francisco's gay pride parades and gay rights demonstrations. Sipple was active in local causes, including the historic political campaigns of openly gay Board of Supervisors candidate Milk. The two were friends and Sipple would also be later described as a \"prominent figure\" in the gay community who had worked in a gay bar and was active in the Imperial Court System.\n\nHe lived with a merchant seaman in a fourth-floor walk-up apartment located in San Francisco's Mission District. He later spent six months in San Francisco's VA hospital, and was frequently readmitted into the hospital in 1975, the year he saved Ford's life.\n\nSipple was part of a crowd of about 3,000 people who had gathered outside San Francisco's St. Francis Hotel to see President Ford on September 22, 1975. Ford, just emerging from the building, was vulnerable despite heavy security protection. Standing beside Sipple in the crowd, was Sara Jane Moore. She was about 40 feet (12 m) away from President Ford when she fired a single shot at him with a revolver, narrowly missing the President. After realizing she had missed, she raised her arm again, and Sipple dived towards her; he grabbed her arm, possibly saving President Ford's life. Sipple said at the time, \"I saw [her gun] pointed out there and I grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off.\" The bullet ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver; he survived. The incident came just three weeks after Lynette Fromme's assassination attempt on Ford. Reporters hounded Sipple who at first did not want his name used, nor his location known.\n\nThe police and the Secret Service immediately commended Sipple for his action at the scene, as did the media. The national news media portrayed Sipple as a hero, and noted his status as a former Marine.\n\nThough he was known to be homosexual among members of the San Francisco gay community, and had even participated in gay pride events, Sipple's sexual orientation was a secret from his family. He asked the press to keep such personal information off the record, making it clear that neither his mother nor his employer knew he was gay.\n\nThe day after the incident, two answering machine messages outed Sipple to \"San Francisco Chronicle's\" columnist Herb Caen. One was from Reverend Ray Broshears, the head of a gay activist group called the Lavender Panthers. The other message was from local gay activist Harvey Milk, a friend of Sipple and on whose campaign for city council Sipple had worked. While discussing whether the truth about Sipple's sexuality should be disclosed, Milk told a friend, \"It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that caca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms.\" Milk outed Sipple in order to portray him as a \"gay hero\" and so to \"break the stereotype of homosexuals\" being \"timid, weak and unheroic figures\".<ref name=\"latimes2/13/89\">Morain, Dan (February 13, 1989). \"Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight\", \"The Los Angeles Times\", p. 1. </ref> According to Harold Evans, \"[T]here was no invitation to the White House for Sipple, not even a commendation. Milk made a fuss about that. Finally, weeks later, Sipple received a brief note of thanks.\"\n\nTwo days after the thwarted assassination attempt, unable to reach Sipple, Caen wrote of Sipple as a gay man, and of a friend of Milk, speculating Ford offered praise \"quietly\" because of Sipple's sexual orientation. Sipple was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother refused to speak to him. Gay liberation groups petitioned local media to give Sipple his due as a gay hero. Caen published the private side of the Marine's story, as did a handful of other publications. Sipple then insisted to reporters that his sexuality was to be kept confidential. Reporters labeled Sipple the \"gay ex-Marine\", and his mother disparaged and disowned him. Later, when Sipple hid in a friend's apartment to avoid them, the reporters turned to Milk, arguably the most visible voice for the gay community. Of President Ford's letter of thanks to Sipple, Milk suggested that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.\n\nSipple sued the \"Chronicle\", filing a $15-million invasion of privacy suit against Caen, seven named newspapers, and a number of unnamed publishers, for publishing the disclosures. The Superior Court in San Francisco dismissed the suit, and Sipple continued his legal battle until May 1984, when a state court of appeals held that Sipple had indeed become news, and that his sexual orientation was part of the story.\n\nAccording to a 2006 article in \"The Washington Post\", Sipple went through a period of estrangement with his parents, but the family later reconciled with him. Sipple's brother, George, told the newspaper, \"[Our parents] accepted it. That was all. They didn't like it, but they still accepted. He was welcomed. Only thing was: Don't bring a lot of your friends.\" However other sources indicate that Sipple's parents never fully accepted him. His mother, just after news broke of Sipple's sexual orientation, hung up on Sipple saying she never wished to speak to him again. His father is said to have told Sipple's brother to \"forget [he had] a brother.\" Finally, when his mother died, his father did not allow him to attend her funeral.\nSipple's mental and physical health sharply declined over the years.

The incident brought him so much attention that, later in life, while drinking, he would express regret about grabbing Moore's gun. On February 2, 1989, an acquaintance, Wayne Friday, found Sipple dead in his San Francisco apartment, with a bottle of Jack Daniel's next to him and the television still on. The San Francisco coroner estimated Sipple had been dead for approximately 10 days. He was 47 years old. Sipple's funeral was attended by about 30 people. President Ford and his wife sent a letter of sympathy to his family and friends. He was buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery south of San Francisco.\n\nHis $334 per month apartment near San Francisco's Tenderloin District was found with many newspaper clippings of his actions on the fateful September afternoon in 1975, including a framed letter from the White House.

He won the National Book Award for fiction in 2014 for his first book-length publication, a collection of short stories, \"Redeployment\". In 2014 the National Book Foundation named him a 5 under 35 honoree. He was a United States Marine officer from 2005 to 2009.\n\nKlay grew up in Westchester, New York, the son of Marie-Therese F. Klay and William D. Klay. He attended Regis High School in New York City, graduating in 2001.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, while a student at Dartmouth College, where he played rugby and boxed, Klay attended Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 2005 and then joined the U.S. Marines, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He later explained that:\n\nDuring the U.S. troop surge in Iraq, he served for thirteen months in Anbar province in Iraq from January 2007 to February 2008. He left the military in 2009 and then earned an M.F.A. in creative writing from Hunter College in 2011.\n\nHe described his time in the military as \"a very mild deployment\" as a Public Affairs Officer. He said that he wrote his collection of short stories based on his service and return to civilian life because:\nHe has objected to the way civilians distance themselves from military experience:\n\nHe has described how \"the gap between public mythology and lived experience\" even affects both veteran-civilian dialogue and the veteran self-perception: \n\nThe culture, according to Klay, presents hurdles to communication and a shared understanding: \nKlay's collection of short stories, \"Redeployment\", was published in March 2014. Writing in the \"Daily Beast\", Brian Castner described the book \"a clinic in the profanities of war\". He wrote:\nIn the \"New York Times\", Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dexter Filkins wrote that \"Klay succeeds brilliantly, capturing on an intimate scale the ways in which the war in Iraq evoked a unique array of emotion, predicament and heartbreak... Iraq comes across not merely as a theater of war but as a laboratory for the human condition in extremis. \"Redeployment\" is ... the best thing written so far on what the war did to people’s souls.\"\n\nIn November 2014, Klay won the National Book Award for fiction for his collection of short stories \"Redeployment\". The judges described it as a \"brutal, piercing sometimes darkly funny collection\" that \"stakes Klay's claim for consideration as the quintessential storyteller of America’s Iraq conflict.\" In his acceptance speech, he said: \"I can't think of a more important conversation to be having — war's too strange to be processed alone. I want to thank everyone who picked up the book, who read it and decided to join the conversation.\" He was the first author to win the prize for his first book-length work of fiction since Julia Glass in 2002. He had been thought \"something of a longshot\" to win. \"The New York Times\" included \"Redeployment\" on its list of the \"Ten Best Books of 2014\", and it received the National Book Critics Circle's 2014 John Leonard Award given for a best first book in any genre. In 2015, he received the James Webb Award for fiction dealing with Marines or Marine Corps life from the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation for \"Redeployment\". In June 2015, \"Redeployment\" received the W.Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction from the American Library Association.\n\nHe has described Colum McCann, author of \"Let the Great World Spin\", as his \"mentor\". He describes himself as a Catholic and \"a fan of a lot of ... the great Catholic literature–Flannery O'Connor, Francois Mauriac, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh.\" He has said that \"religion and the tradition of Catholic thought ... helps you ask the right kinds of questions about these issues... There's a type of religious sentiment that is very certain of the answers and very certain about what should be proselytized. And then there's another type of religious tradition which is really much more about ... doubt and working your way towards more and more difficult questions. And I think that's the tradition that appeals to me.\"\n\nHe is a contributor to \"Granta\". He has also reviewed fiction for \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"Newsweek\". His stories have appeared in collections as well, including \"The Best American Non-Required Reading 2012\" (Mariner Books) and \"Fire and Forget\" (Da Capo Press, 2013). He has conducted several interviews with other writers and published them on The Rumpus.\n\nPrinceton University named him a Hodder Fellow for the 2015-2016 academic year.

{"id": "7209442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7209442", "title": "Rudi Schneider", "text": "Rudi Schneider\n\nRudi Schneider (July 27, 1908 – April 28, 1957), son of Josef Schneider and brother of Willi Schneider, was an Austrian Spiritualist and physical medium. His career was covered extensively by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, and he took part in a number of notable experiments conducted by paranormal researchers/debunkers, including Harry Price, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing and Eric Dingwall. Some of these researchers declared him to be a fraud while others were unable to find evidence of trickery.\n\nSchneider began participating in séances with his elder brother Willi Schneider at age 11. Both Rudi and Willi claimed to channel a spirit entity called \"Olga\" who in the séance room claimed to be \"Lola Montez\" the nickname of Eliza Eosanna Gilbert (1821-1861) the mistress of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Schneider held his first solo séance in 1919 and is said to have been able to summon the ghostly image of a human hand, as well as a number of other manifestations that are traditionally associated with séances. \n\nSchneider began giving demonstrations to the Vienna \"Institut fur Radiumforschung der Academic der Wissenschaffen\" in 1923. In an investigation into the mediumship of Schneider in 1924 the physicists Stefan Meyer and Karl Przibram caught Schneider evading the controls in a series of séances. After Meyer and Przibram's accusations, the institute concluded that the abilities that Schneider had demonstrated up to that point were all, based on the balance of probability, the result of trickery and that he was no-longer of interest to them.\n\nIn 1926, American journalist Warren Vinton attended séances with Schneider and came to the conclusion that the movement of objects were fraudulently produced by other members of the Schneider family concealed in the room. In April 1927, Vinton published an article in \"Psyche\" which accused Schneider of being a fraud and using a hidden accomplice. Another researcher, J. Malcolm Bird who attended a séance with Schneider also supported Vinton's accusations.\n\nThe parapsychologist Walter Franklin Prince attended a series of sittings with Schneider and no paranormal phenomena was observed. In his notes in the Bulletin VII of the Boston SPR published under \"Experiments with Physical Mediums in Europe\" (1928) he wrote \"despite my studied and unremitting complaisance, no phenomena have occurred when I had any part in the control, save curtain movement which were capable of the simplest explanation.\" Whilst Prince did not detect any concrete evidence of fraud he found the red light too dim to observe the medium and suspected that Schneider's spirit guide \"Olga\" insisted the sitters talk loudly to act as a distraction and possible cover for an accomplice in the room.\n\nAccording to Peter Underwood it was discovered that Schneider had a \"sexual climax\" during some of his séances. Schneider had an orgasm during some of his mediumship practices. Psychologist D. H. Rawcliffe wrote that Schneider \"had been repeatedly and comprehensively exposed\" as a fraudulent trickster.\n\nIn 1929, Schneider took part in a number of experiments conducted by notable investigator/debunker Harry Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. Price conducted a series of experiments in which Schneider was connected to a series of pressure switches that would alert observers if he moved his hands, feet or limbs in any significant way. Schneider was also physically restrained during some of the experiments. Price recorded that during his experiments various phenomena were observed; including the movement of objects placed around the room and the apparent manifestation of mysterious hands and shapes.\n\nSchneider claimed he could levitate objects but according to Price a photograph taken on April 28, 1932 showed that Schneider had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. After this, many scientists considered Schneider to be exposed as a fraud, however there was a controversy over the photograph from the parapsychology community. Price wrote that the findings of the other experiments should be revised due to the evidence showing how Schneider could free himself from the controls.\n\nAfter Price had exposed Schneider, various scientists such as Karl Przibram and the magician Henry Evans wrote to Price telling him that they agreed that Schneider evaded control during his séances and congratulated Price on the success of unmasking the fraud. In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Schneider's mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that the Price photograph was a hoax. SPR member Anita Gregory claimed Price had deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Schneider's reputation. The psychologist Alan Gauld wrote that Gregory's analysis of the photograph was misconceived and there was no direct evidence the photograph taken by Price had been tampered with. In opposition to Gregory the photographic expert Vernon Harrison testified that the photograph was genuine. Harrison suggested that instead of fraud the shock of the flash caused Schneider to jerk involuntarily breaking free from the control, and when the second flash went off, recorded him in that position. SPR member John L. Randall who reviewed the Price and Schneider case also came to the conclusion the photograph was genuine. However, Randall disagreed with Harrison that Schneider's movement was accidental and wrote the photograph was evidence for Price's claim that Schneider had freed his hand with fraudulent intent.\n\nV. J. Woolley criticized the electronic controls of Price's experiments. He noted they were liable to go wrong such as a broken wire and that they were not fraud proof like Price had claimed. According to Woolley one sitter alone could \"free his feet by connecting his metal floor plates by a piece of wire... I do not feel that the electrical control excludes [fraud] any better than the older methods which Mr Price describes as obsolete\".\n\nIn 1930, Schneider began working with French paranormal investigator Eugéne Osty at the \"Institut Metapsychique\". Osty placed an object in the room with Schneider and targeted it with a camera that had an infrared trigger designed to take a picture if it detected movement around the object. The alarm was triggered several times though the photographs showed no evidence of Schneider having interfered with it. Osty concluded that he was recording the passage of an ectoplasm like substance that was indicative of telekinetic movement. He wrote that the substance registered on sound recording equipment when it moved, and that it could pass through objects put in place to impede it.\n\nOsty's experiments with Schneider have been criticized by skeptics. D. H. Rawcliffe for example noted that \"various discrepancies have come to light which throw the whole of Osty's experiments into doubt. Price made a prolonged investigation of Rudi Schneider and proved conclusively that the medium resorted to trickery when he believed himself to be unobserved... Osty has too often shown in the past, despite some intellectual ability, evidence of an amateurish and uncritical approach to his subject.\"\n\nIn the 1920s Fritz Wittels who had attended séances with Schneider wrote that \"With occult waves running high in Vienna, there was a famous medium named Rudi Schneider, a few of whose meetings I attended. Whenever I came, however, either nothing happened at all or the things which did happen were obvious frauds.\" It was reported by Stefan Meyer that Schneider was exposed as a fraud by Dr. Lothar Lenkei.\n\nIn 1928, E. R. Dodds and V. J. Woolley attended six séances in dim red light with Schneider and absolutely no phenomena occurred. Dodds wrote that semen was found after one of the séances. \n\nIn a series of mediumship sessions in 1932 which included the researchers and scientists Dr. William Brown, C. E. M. Joad, Professor D. F. Fraser-Harris, Professor John Alexander Gunn and Julian Huxley, no paranormal phenomena was observed in the séance room with Schneider. Huxley wrote that there was \"no proof of any communication with departed spirits\". Zoologist Solly Zuckerman also attended some séance sittings and wrote that the mediumship of Schneider had not passed any scientific tests.\n\nWilliam Howard Livens on 15 November 1932 attended a séance with Schneider and no paranormal phenomenon was observed.\n\nBetween October 1933 and March 1934 Schneider was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research in fifty-five sittings and not a single paranormal phenomenon was observed. Infrared ray apparatus was installed by Oliver Gatty working with Theodore Besterman. The experiments proved negative, no telekinetic phenomena of any kind were observed or any absorption of the infrared rays. Every chance was given to Schneider to prove his alleged paranormal abilities but nothing paranormal occurred. Another researcher, Whately Carington had proven by tests that the spirit \"Olga\" which Schneider channeled in reality was indistinguishable in psychological make-up from himself. Oliver Gatty and Theodore Besterman communicated their results to \"Nature\", concluding that in their tests there was \"no good evidence that Rudi Schneider possesses supernormal powers.\" \n\nThere were no more investigations as in his later years Schneider gave up mediumship to become an auto mechanic.\n\n"}

On September 11, 2001, Waleed along with his brother, Wail, boarded American Airlines Flight 11 and was one of five that helped hijack it, so that Mohamed Atta could fly the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.\n\nStudying to become a teacher like his brother, Wail, Waleed al-Shehri was from 'Asir province, a poor region in southwestern Saudi Arabia that borders Yemen. Since Shehri's family adhered to the Wahhabi school of Islam, he grew up in a very conservative household. His family did not have satellite television or internet and he was forbidden to play music or have contact with girls until he was old enough for an arranged marriage.\n\nEarly media accounts said that Waleed had earned his pilot's certificate at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1997. However, after a short investigation, Embry-Riddle was discovered to have not had any involvement in the flight training of the terrorists. A former student shared the same name as one of the hijackers, but the student, who is still alive, had no connections to al-Qaeda.\n\nWaleed left his studies to accompany his brother's leave of absence after Wail complained of a mental symptom that had caused him grief, telling their father that he intended to seek aid from a religious healer in Medina.\n\nThe brothers arrived at the Al Farouq training camp in Afghanistan, where they met Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Before arriving at Al-Farouq, the four reportedly pledged themselves to jihad in Spring 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail, who had dubbed himself \"Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi\" after one of Muhammad's companions.\n\nWaleed later served in the security forces at Kandahar International Airport with Saeed al-Ghamdi. After being selected for the operation, he trained with the other hijackers at al-Matar complex under Abu Turab al-Urduni.\n\nWaleed returned to Saudi Arabia with his brother in the fall of 2000 so they could obtain clean passports and U.S. visas, which they did on 3 October and 24 October 2000, respectively.\n\nLocals reported that he and his brother disappeared from Khamis Mushayt in the south of Saudi Arabia in December 2000.\n\nIn mid-November, 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that three of the future muscle hijackers, Wail al Shehri, Waleed al Shehri, and Ahmed al-Nami, all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get \"clean\" passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.\n\nAfter training, he would have moved to a safehouse in Karachi, Pakistan before travelling to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). From the UAE, the muscle hijackers came to the U.S. between April and June 2001. Waleed may have arrived in the U.S. on 23 April 2001. Some sources report that Shehri \"at times\" stayed at lead hijacker Mohamed Atta's apartment in Hamburg, Germany at some period between 1998 and 2001. Others place him with Zacarias Moussaoui in London.\n\nRamzi bin al-Shibh says that Osama bin Laden had given a message to Waleed al Shehri for conveyance to Mohamed Atta earlier that spring, indicating that bin Laden preferred to attack the White House instead of the Capitol.\nOn May 4, 2001, he applied for and received a Florida driver's license. The next day, he filled out a change-of-address form to receive a duplicate license. Five other suspected hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity. On 19 May 2001, Shehri and Satam al-Suqami flew from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport, Bahamas, where they had reservations at the Bahamas Princess Resort where Shehri and Suqami rented two cars, a black Buick Regal and a gray Ford Taurus. The two were turned away by Bahamian officials on arrival, however, because they lacked visas; they returned to Florida that same day. The 9/11 Commission felt that they likely took this trip to renew Suqami's immigration status, as Suqami's legal stay in the United States ended on 21 May 2001.\n\nHe was one of nine hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001. While living in Boynton, neighbors reported that he seemed to be an enthusiastic fan of the Florida Marlins.\n\nOn July 16, 2001, both Wail and Waleed were staying at a hotel in Salou, Spain where they were visited by Mohamed Atta. On July 30, Shehri traveled alone from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. He flew to San Francisco the next day, where he stayed one night before returning via Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to librarian Kathleen Hensmen, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri used the Internet access at Delray Beach Public Library in August 2001, where they may have been looking at information on crop dusting; they reportedly left the library with a third Middle Eastern man thought to be Marwan al-Shehhi, who Hensmen said asked her for the name of a local restaurant. \n\nOn September 5, 2001, Wail and Waleed al Shehri traveled together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462 from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. Wail checked in together with Waleed at the Park Inn Hotel in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts on 5 September 2001, staying in room 432. Abdulaziz al-Omari, may have also spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with Mohamed Atta for Portland, Maine on 10 September 2001. When they checked out, the Shehri brothers may have left a discarded sheet of instructions on how to fly a transcontinental jetliner in their hotel room.\n\nWaleed al-Shehri, his brother Wail, and Abdulaziz al-Omari arrived together at Logan Airport at 06:45 on the morning of September 11, 2001, having left their Ford Focus rental car in the airport parking facility. Upon check-in, Wail al-Shehri was selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), as was his brother Waleed, and Flight 11 hijacker Satam al-Suqami. Mohamed Atta, the pilot hijacker on Flight 11 had also been selected in Portland. Being selected by CAPPS meant that their checked baggage were subject to extra screening. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.\n\nBy 7:40 a.m., all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 7:45 a.m. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26 and departed Logan International Airport at 7:59 a.m. from runway 4R after a 14-minute delay. The hijacking of Flight 11 began at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center. The damage caused to the North Tower destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.\n\nOn September 23, 2001 \"BBC News\" reported that al-Shehri was \"alive and well\" in Casablanca, Morocco, and was talking to multiple media organizations; however, due to confusion over the man's identity, and editorial concerns over conspiracy theories, \"BBC News\" later modified the September 23 report by inserting \"A man called ... \" \"BBC News\" considers the September 23 report superseded by an October 5, 2001 report that lists Waleed as one of the alleged hijackers believed by the FBI to be responsible for the September 11 attacks.\n\nWaleed and Wail were both reported to have been initially found, in error, by a Saudi newspaper editor as the sons of Ahmed Alshehri, a senior Saudi diplomat stationed in Bombay, India. On September 16, 2001, the diplomat Ahmed Alshehri denied that he was the father of the two hijackers. Wail claims he \"did\" attend Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida — but was the victim of mistaken identity, since he used that training to secure his current position with a Moroccan airline company. Saudi Arabia has confirmed his story, and suggested he was the victim of identity theft.\n\nMuhammad Ali al-Shehri, the Shehri brothers' true father, was identified prior to September 17, 2001, and told Arab News that he had not heard from his sons in ten months prior to September 2001. An \"ABC News\" story in March 2002 repeated this, and during a report entitled \"A Saudi Apology\" for \"Dateline NBC\" on August 25, 2002, \"NBC\" reporter John Hockenberry traveled to 'Asir, where he interviewed the third brother, Salah, who agreed that his two brothers were dead and claimed they had been \"brainwashed\".\n\nFurthermore, another article explains that the pilot who lives in Casablanca was named Walid al-Shri (not Waleed M. al-Shehri) and that much of the \"BBC\" information regarding \"alive\" hijackers was incorrect according to the same sources used by \"BBC\". In September 2007, a video recording of his last testament was released to mark the 6th anniversary of the attacks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23001272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23001272", "title": "Wei Guoqing", "text": "Wei Guoqing\n\nWei Guoqing (; Zhuang: Veiz Gozcing) (2 September 1913 – 14 June 1989) was a Chinese government official, military officer and political commissar. He served on the Communist Party of China's Politburo (1973–1982) and as Director of the People's Liberation Army's General Political Department (1977–1982). Wei was one of the few members of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Central Committees (1969–1987) and the 10th through 12th politburos not purged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (GPCR) or Deng Xiaoping's backlash. He was also a Vice Chair of the National People's Congress Standing Committee (1975–1989) and of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1964–1983).\n\nWei was born in Donglan, Guangxi, to a poor Zhuang minority family. He joined the Chinese Red Army at the age of 16 (1929) and the CPC in 1931. He rose to the rank of battalion commander in the Seventh Army under Deng Xiaoping and was a regimental commander on the Long March. After the Long March he served in the 344th Brigade, and then marched south under Huang Kecheng's 5th Column in January 1940. By 1944, he commanded the 4th Division of the New Fourth Army, and later three columns (the 2nd, 10th and 12th) of the North Jiangsu Army in the Huai-Hai Campaign. In 1948, Wei held off the Nationalist 2nd Army Corps of Qiu Qingquan and 100 tanks of the 5th Corps under the command of Jiang Weiguo (Chiang Wei-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son) in a decisive delaying action in the Huai-Hai Campaign. In 1949, Wei was deputy political commissar of General Ye Fei's Tenth Army Group of the Third Field Army.\n\nWei was deeply involved in China's relations with North Vietnam from 1950. In April of that year, Liu Shaoqi sent him to Vietnam as head of the Chinese Military Advisory Group, to advise Ho Chi Minh on fighting the French; Wei remained in Vietnam until September 1955. In this role he led a group of 281 experienced military officers from the Second, Third and Fourth Field Armies in a mission that began within days of the outbreak of the Korean War. Wei's work across Field Army lines would stand him in good stead later in his career. General Chen Geng joined the CMAG in July as the representative of the Central Committee, but left for Korea in November, leaving Wei as the senior Chinese official in Vietnam.\n\nIn October 1953, Wei reportedly personally gave Ho Chi Minh a copy of the French Navarre plan. In response, the Việt Minh pushed on to Lai Châu and toward northern Laos, rather than the Red River Delta. Some months later, in 1954, Wei is said to have advised General Võ Nguyên Giáp to surround and attack General Navarre at Dien Bien Phu, a strategy that eventually led to complete French withdrawal from Indochina.\n\nIn June 1954, Wei attended the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina with Premier Zhou Enlai, USSR Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Vietnamese representative Phạm Văn Đồng, US State Department official Bedell Smith and UK Deputy Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs for Administration Anthony Eden. Wei was specifically instructed to discuss military matters with the Vietnamese delegation when Molotov, Smith and Eden were not present. Wei, Pham, Ho, General Giap and others went to Nanning, Guangxi, in late June 1954 to discuss strategy for Indochina.\n\nWhen formal military ranks were introduced in 1955, Wei Guoqing was made a general, and in 1956 became an Alternate Member of the Central Committee at the Eighth National Party Congress.\n\nAfter returning to China, Wei moved to Nanning, Guangxi, where he was the senior party (1961-GPCR) and government (1955-GPCR) official in Guangxi Autonomous Region for an unusually long period. It was from Guangxi and Yunnan that Chinese troops entered Vietnam in 1965–70.\n\nIn his role as the senior-most official in Guangxi, Wei hosted the January 1958 Nanning Conference, attended by Chairman Mao Zedong and most of the very top leadership. While Wei was a junior among the heavyweights, he was present at one of the decisive Great Leap Forward discussions where outrageous targets were approved.\n\nGeneral Wei was named 1st Political Commissar of the Guangxi Military District (MD) in January 1964, a post he held until October 1975. He added the leadership of the CPC committee in February 1971.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Wei managed to keep control of Guangxi. In March 1967, Zhou Enlai ordered the establishment of the \"Guangxi Revolutionary Preparatory Group\", headed by incumbent CPC 1st Party Secretary Wei. However, Wei was beaten by a Guangxi-origin mob in August while visiting Beijing. In 1968, the \"Guangxi April 22 Revolutionary Action Command\" opposed Wei Guoqing's leadership while the \"Guangxi United Command of Proletarian Revolutionaries\" supported him. After the PLA backers of the former group were transferred to Beijing, Wei launched an artillery bombardment on parts of the city controlled by his opponents. The resulting conflict saw the destruction of some 166 boats on the Nanning river, and dozens of buildings. The results were endorsed by the faction in charge in Beijing. He was named Chairman of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee in August 1968, and remained in that post, and the province, until October 1975.\n\nAs concerns about Marshall Lin Biao's loyalties began to arise, Mao Zedong in August 1971 met with regional leaders in Changsha, including Hua Guofeng, and Wei to criticize Lin; and in Nanchang with Xu Shiyou and Han Xianchu.\n\nIn December 1973, Wei was named 1st Political Commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region (MR), a post he held until the end of 1978. The MR Commander, General Xu Shiyou, was an old ally of Deng Xiaoping and together they sheltered him from the Gang of Four after the April 1976 Tiananmen Incident and Deng's third purge.\n\nIn the post-Mao reshuffle, General Wei took over the PLA General Political Department (GPD) from Gang of Four member Zhang Chunqiao, thus becoming the political commissar for the entire People's Liberation Army. He was also named to the 11th Central Committee Politburo, in 1977. Wei served in the GPD and Deputy Secretary-General and Standing Committee member of the CPC Military Affairs Commission, 1977–82.\n\nWei's old Guangzhou MR partner, General Xu Shiyou, took overall commend (along with General Yang Dezhi) of the Chinese invasion of Vietnam in February 1979. However, General Wei does not appear to have had a direct role in the Sino-Vietnamese War, possibly due to his close workings with the Vietnamese in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn August 1982, Liberation Army Daily, the newspaper directly under General Political Department Director Wei's authority, published a broadside against \"bourgeois liberalization\" that was seen as an attack on Deng Xiaoping's policies just prior to the 12thParty Congress. As a result, Wei was dismissed, and replaced by General Yu Qiuli.\n"}
