She is a comic book superhero published by DC Comics. Lorena debuted in \"Aquaman\" vol. 6 #16 (May 2004), and was created by Will Pfeifer and Patrick Gleason.\n\nLorena Marquez is on a date at the San Diego Zoo when an earthquake shakes San Diego and causes it to sink deep into the sea, killing thousands—including Lorena's entire family. She comes into contact with Aquaman, who nurses her back to health as she discovers that she has developed the ability to breathe underwater like an Atlantean. The two manage to locate the other survivors of the quake, as well as Anton Geist, the scientist responsible for the catastrophe. Lorena and Aquaman have no choice but to begin rebuilding the city as \"Sub Diego.\" When Ocean Master switches lives with Aquaman, Lorena assumes the identity of Aquagirl, adopting an aquatic costume. After Aquaman exposes Ocean Master's scheme, Lorena keeps her Aquagirl costume and identity, and the two carry on protecting Sub Diego. When a string of homicides begin to emerge in Sub Diego, Lorena was one of the first to discover that it was former police officer Chandra Abbot who was guilty. The two fight and Chandra admits she did not understand why Aquaman would allow Lorena to help him but she at that moment she understood, she is a good detective.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" Volume 3 #34 (May 2006), Lorena is shown at Titans Tower arguing with Holly Granger during a flashback. Lorena is also a member of the Teen Titans during the events of \"52\". She assists Steel in launching an attack on LexCorp when Natasha Irons is captured by Lex Luthor. She later resurfaces as supporting character of the new Aquaman, Arthur Joseph Curry, in \"Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis\". Apparently, as one of the last Sub Diegoans able to breathe water, she is left in the seas, mourning Koryak's death in the rubble of Poseidonis. She then joins Curry, Cal Durham, Tempest, and the new Topo in their voyage to Sub Diego. Aquagirl appears up in \"Terror Titans\" #1 and is kidnapped (along with a group of other teen superheroes) by the Terror Titans. While her teammate Molecule is slain by the new Persuader, Lorena is taken alive, to be mindwiped and forced to fight in the Dark Side Club at the behest of the Apokoliptan Gods on Earth. She is defeated twice, once by Rose Wilson after being stabbed, and again by a brainwashed Terra, who crushes Lorena with a pair of boulders. Aquagirl and the others are eventually freed by Miss Martian, and Lorena joins the survivors in a trek to Titans Tower in order to recover.\n\nWhile resting in the tower, Lorena meets and befriends Static, telling him that she enjoyed her past experience as a member of the Teen Titans. After realizing that she has nowhere to go and no family, Lorena accepts Wonder Girl's offer to rejoin the team, taking up permanent residence in Titans Tower.\n\nRemaining close friends with Static, Lorena also begins flirting in Spanish with her teammate Blue Beetle, despite him already dating teen superheroine and Titan reserve member, Traci 13. She also quickly gains an enemy in Bombshell, finding her to be rude. Despite her apparent concern for both Static and Blue Beetle, Aquagirl begins flirting with Superboy after she witnesses a fight between him and Wonder Girl.\n\nDuring a mission to rescue Raven from an extradimensional being called Wyld, Aquagirl and Bombshell are swallowed by massive sea monster mutated from Wyld's energy. After Static destroys Wyld, Aquagirl and Bombshell are left missing at sea with their fates uncertain. In the following issue, it is mentioned that both Bombshell and Aquagirl had been rescued by their teammates, but were removed from the Titans due to Wonder Girl no longer wishing to endanger \"inexperienced\" teen heroes by allowing them membership.\n\nIn the \"Brightest Day\" crossover, Lorena is approached by Mera who had come searching for help against her sister and her Death Squad. She and Mera subsequently reappear when Siren and her army attack Miami, Florida as the opening salvo of an invasion. During the battle, Lorena rescues the new Aqualad by kicking Black Manta in the face just as he is about to stab the youth to death. After Mera and Aqualad successfully trap the invaders inside the Bermuda Triangle, Lorena tells Aqualad not to \"get any ideas\" as the two teens watch Aquaman and Mera passionately kiss.\n\nShe is one of the former Titans that came to aid them in the battle between Superboy-Prime.\n\n\nIn the \"Titans Tomorrow\" timeline, Lorena is Aquawoman, a member of the Titans.

{"id": "28003496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28003496", "title": "Bengali Hindus", "text": "Bengali Hindus\n\nBengali Hindus () are an ethnic, linguistic, and religious population who make up the majority in the Indian state of West Bengal and Tripura. In Bangladesh they form the largest minority. They are Bengalis adherents of Hinduism, and are native to the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. Bengali Hindus speak Bengali, which belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family and adhere to the Shakta and Vaishnava traditions of their native religion, Hinduism. There are significant numbers of Bengali-speaking Hindus in different Indian states. \n\nAround the 8th century, the Bengali language branched off from Magadhi Prakrit, a derivative of Sanskrit that was prevalent in the eastern region of the Indian Subcontinent at that time. During the Sena period (11th – 12th century) the Bengali culture developed into a distinct culture within the Hindu civilisation. Bengali Hindus were at the forefront of the Bengal Renaissance in the 19th century. The Bengal region was noted for its participation in struggle for the independence from the British rule. At the time of independence of India in 1947, the province of Bengal was partitioned between India and East Pakistan, part of the Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. Millions of Bengali Hindus migrated from East Bengal (later Bangladesh) and settled in West Bengal and other states of India. The migration continued in waves through the fifties and sixties, especially during the 1950 East Pakistan genocide and the 1964 East-Pakistan riots. In 1971, during the Bangladesh Liberation War, an estimated 2.4 million Bengali Hindus were massacred by the Pakistani army. Estimates for the total number of people killed by Pakistan Army range from 300,000 to 3,000,000.\nThe Hindus are a religious group, native to the Indian subcontinent, speaking a broad range of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages and adhering to the native belief systems, rooted in the Vedas. The word Hindu is popularly believed to be a Persian exonym for the people native to the Indian subcontinent. The word is derived from Sindhu, the Sanskrit name for the river Indus and it initially referred to the people residing to the east of the river. The Hindus are constituted into various ethno-linguistic subgroups, which in spite of being culturally diverse, share a common bond of unity.\n\nThe word Bengali is derived from the Bengali word \"bangali\". The English word Bengali denoting the people as well as the language is derived from the English word Bengal denoting the region, which itself is derived ultimately from the Bengali word Vanga which was one of the five historical kingdoms of Eastern India. According to Harivamsa, Bali, the king of the asuras had five sons from his wife Sudeshna through sage Dirghatama. The five sons namely Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Pundra and Sumha went on to found five kingdoms of the same name in the eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. In ancient times Vanga proper consisted of the deltaic region between Bhagirathi, Padma and Madhumati, but later on extended to include the regions which now roughly comprise the Indian state of West Bengal and Bangladesh.\n\nIn India, they tend to identify themselves as Bengalis while in Bangladesh they tend to identify themselves as Hindus. In the global context, the terms Indian Bengali and Bangladeshi Hindu are respectively used. In India, Bengali generally refers to Bengali Hindus, excluding a significant number of Bengali Muslims who are also ethnically Bengalis. The 'other' is usually identified as 'non-Bengali', a term that generically refers to the Hindu people who are not Bengali speaking, but sometimes specifically used to denote the Hindi speaking population.\n\nThe Bengali Hindus constitute of numerous endogamous castes, which are sometimes further subdivided into endogamous subgroups. The caste system evolved over centuries and became more and more complex with time. In the medieval period, several castes were boycotted by the ruling classes from time to time and this isolation continued till the 19th century. These social boycotts were somewhat discriminatory in nature. After the Renaissance, the rigidity of the caste system ceased to a great extent, so much so that the first celebrated intercaste marriage took place as early as in 1925.\n\nThe Bengali Hindu families are patriarchal as well as patrilocal and traditionally follow a joint family system. However, due to the Partition and subsequent urbanisation, the joint families have given way to the nuclear families. The Bengali Hindus were traditionally governed by the Dāyabhāga school of law, as opposed to the Mitākṣarā school of law, which governed the other Hindu ethno-linguistic groups. In India, after the promulgation of the Hindu code bills, the Bengali Hindus along with other Hindus are being governed by a uniform Hindu law.\n\nThere are two major social subgroups among the Bengali Hindus – the ghotis and the bangals. The Bengali Hindus who emigrated from East Bengal (Bangladesh) at the wake of the Partition and settled in West Bengal, came to known as the bangals, while the native Bengali Hindus of West Bengal came to known as ghotis. For several decades after partition, these two social subgroups possessed marked difference in their accents and their rivalry was manifested in many spheres of life, most notably in the support for the football clubs of East Bengal and Mohun Bagan respectively. Several such differences have eased with passing years.\n\nIn the ancient times, some of the Bengali Hindus were seafaring people as evident from Vijay Singha's naval conquest of Lanka, the tales of merchants like Chand Sadagar and Dhanapati Saudagor whose ships sailed to far off places for trade and establishment of colonies in South East Asia. By the 3rd century B.C.E. they were united into a powerful state, known to the Greeks as Gangaridai, whose military prowess demoralised Alexander from further expedition to the east. Later the region of Bengal came under Maurya, Shunga and Gupta rule. In the 7th century, Shashanka became the independent Hindu ruler of Gauda. He successfully fought against his adversaries Harshavardhana and Bhaskaravarmana and protected the sovereignty of the people.\n\nIn the middle of the 8th century, the Bengali Hindu nobility democratically elected Gopala as the ruler of Gauda, ushering in an era of peace and prosperity in Bengal, ending almost a century of chaos and confusion. The Buddhist Pala rulers unified Bengal into a single political entity and expanded it into an empire, conquering a major portion of North India. During this time, the Bengali Hindus excelled in art, literature, philosophy, mathematics, sciences and statecraft. The first scriptures in Bengali \"Charyapada\" was composed during the Pala rule. The Pala were followed by the Senas who made far reaching changes in the social structure of Bengali Hindus, introducing 36 new castes and orthodox institutions like kulinism.\n\nThe literary progress of the Pala and Sena period came to a halt after the Turkish conquest in the early 13th century. Except for Haridas Datta's \"Manasar Bhasan\" no significant literary work was composed for about a century after the conquest. Even though the ruling classes resisted the invaders, Gauda, the centre of Bengal polity, fell to the Islamic invaders. During this period hundreds of temples and monasteries were desecrated. The next attack on the society came from the Islamic missionaries. Local chieftains like Akananda, Dakshin Ray and Mukut Ray, resisted the missionary activities.\n\nThe Pathan occupation of Bengal was limited to the region of Gauda, the rest of which was held in sway by different Bengali Hindu rulers. Islam religion gradually spread throughout the Bengal region, and many Bengali Hindus were forcefully converted to Islam. In the early 15th century, the Pathan rule of Gauda was overthrown by the Bengali Hindu nobility under the leadership of Ganesha. When the Delhi-based Mughals tried to bring Bengal under their direct rule, the Bengali Hindu chiefs along with some Bengali Muslims consolidated themselves into confederacies and resisted the Mughals. After the fall of the confederacies, the Mughals brought a major part of Bengal under their control, and constituted a \"subah\".\n\nDuring the decline of the Mughal Empire, Nawabs of Bengal (who were Muslim) ruled a large part of Bengal. During the reign of Alivardi Khan. a Nawab, the severe taxation and frequent raids made the life miserable for the ordinary Bengali people. A section of the Bengali Hindu nobility helped the British East India Company in overthrowing the Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah regime. After obtaining the revenue rights, the East India Company imposed more oppressive taxation that led to the famine of 1770, in which approximately one third of the Bengali population died of starvation.\n\nThe British began to face stiff resistance in conquering the semi-independent Bengali Hindu kingdoms outside the pale of Muslim occupied Bengal. In some cases, even when their rulers have been captured or killed, the ordinary people began to carry on the fight. These resistances took the form of \"Bhumij\" (Chuar is a deragatory term used by the English to denote the Bhumij) and Paik Rebellion. These warring people were later listed as criminal tribes and barred from recruitment in the Indian army. In 1766, the British troops were completely routed by the \"sanyasi\"s and \"fakir\"s or the warrior monks at Dinhata, where the latter resorted guerilla warfare. Bankim Chandra's \"Anandamath\" is based on the Famine and consequential Sannyasi Rebellion.\n\nAccording to author James Jeremiah Novak, as British rulers took power from Bengal's ruling Muslim class, they strategically catered to Bengali Hindus (a majority in Bengal region at that time). The British rule destroyed the bases of Bengali Muslim society. Bengali Hindus got favours from the British rulers, and experienced development in education and social mobility. In the 19th century, the elite class of Bengali Hindu people underwent radical social reforms and rapid modernisation; the phenomenon came to be known as the Bengal Renaissance.\n\nPublic media like press and theatres became vents of nationalist sentiments, apolitical organisations had given way to political platforms, secret revolutionary societies emerged and the society at large became restive.\n\nWith rising nationalism among Bengali Hindus, the British rulers applied divide and rule policy, and started to make favours to Bengali Muslims. To keep the rising Bengali Hindu aspirations at bay, the British partitioned the province in 1905 and along with some additional restructuring came up with two provinces – Eastern Bengal & Assam and Bengal itself, in each of which the Bengali Hindus were reduced to minorities. The Bengali Hindus, however, opposed to the Partition tooth and nail, embarked on a political movement of Swadeshi, boycott and revolutionary nationalism. On 28 September 1905, the day of Mahalaya, 50,000 Bengali Hindus resolved before the Mother at Kalighat to boycott foreign goods and stop employing foreigners. The British Raj finally annulled the Partition in 1911. The Raj, however, carried out some restructuring, and carved out Bengali Hindu majority districts like Manbhum, Singbhum, Santal Pargana and Purnia awarding them to Bihar and others like Cachar that were awarded to Assam, which effectively made the Bengali Hindus a minority in the united province of Bengal. The Britishers also transferred the capital from Calcutta to New Delhi.\n\nThe revolutionary movement gained momentum after the Partition. Bengali revolutionaries collaborated with the Germans during the War to liberate British India. Later the revolutionaries defeated the British army in the Battle of Jalalabad and liberated Chittagong. During the Quit India Movement, the revolutionaries liberated the Tamluk and Contai subdivision of Midnapore district from British rule and established the Tamralipta National Government.\nThe British, unable to control the revolutionary activities, decided to hinder the Bengali Hindu people through administrative reforms. The Government of India Act 1919 introduced in the 144 member Bengal Legislative Assembly, 46 seats for the Muslims, 59 for the institutions, Europeans & others and left the rest 39 as General, where the Bengali Hindus were to scramble for a representation. The situation worsened with the Communal Award of 1932, where in the 250 member Bengal Legislative Assembly a disproportionate 119 seats were reserved for the Muslims, 17 for Europeans, Anglo-Indians & Indian Christians, 34 for the institutions, and the rest 80 were left as General. The Communal Award further divided the Hindus into Scheduled Caste Hindus and Caste Hindus. Out of the 80 General seats, 10 were reserved for the Scheduled Castes. In response the leading Bengali Hindu landholders, lawyers and professionals signed the Bengal Hindu Manifesto on 23 April 1932 rejecting the justification of reservation of separate electorates for Muslims in the Bengal Legislative Assembly.\n\nIn 1946, the Muslim League supporters started a series of violent attacks against Hindus in Kolkata in the name of Direct Action Day, which escalated into the bloodiest communal riots between Hindus and Muslims of modern India. After the initial attacks, rapes and killings by Muslims, Bengali Hindus joined hands with Sikhs and non-Bengali Hindus in attacking Muslims and ultimately it turned out to be a violent reprisal that resulted in heavy casualties of Muslims, finally forcing the government to stop the mayhem. Later in the year, the Muslim League government orchestrated the infamous Noakhali genocide.\n\nThe Direct Action Day and the Noakhali genocide prompted the Bengali Hindu leadership to move for the creation of a Bengali Hindu majority province by partitioning Bengal. At that time, the movement for creation of Pakistan was in full swing and Bengal was supposed to form one of its constituent provinces. After the failure of United Bengal plan when it became evident that all of Bengal would go to Pakistan, the Bengali Hindus voted for the Partition of Bengal. On 23 April 1947, the Amrita Bazar Patrika published the results of an opinion poll, in which 98.3% of the Bengali Hindus favoured the creation of a separate homeland. The proposal for the Partition of Bengal was moved in the Legislative Assembly on 20 June 1947, where the Hindu members voted 58–21 in favour of the Partition with two members abstaining.\n\nThe Boundary Commission awarded the Bengali Hindus a territory far less in proportion to their population which was around 46% of the population of the province, awarding the Bengali Hindu majority district of Khulna to Pakistan. However, some Bengali Muslim majority districts such as Murshidabad and Malda were handed to India.\n\nAfter the Partition, the majority of the urban upper class and middle class Bengali Hindu population of East Bengal immigrated to West Bengal. The ones who stayed back were the ones who had significant landed property and believed that they will be able to live peacefully in an Islamic state. However, after the genocide of 1950, Bengali Hindus fled East Bengal in thousands and settled in West Bengal. In 1964, tens of thousands of Bengali Hindus were massacred in East Pakistan and most of the Bengali Hindu owned businesses and properties of Dhaka were permanently destroyed During the liberation war of Bangladesh, an estimated 2.4 million Bengali Hindus were massacred in Bangladesh. The Enemy Property Act of the Pakistan regime which is still in force in the new incarnation of Vested Property Act, has been used by successive Bangladeshi governments to seize the properties of the Hindu minorities who left the country during the Partition of India and Bangladesh liberation war. According to Professor Abul Barkat of Dhaka University, the Act has been used to misappropriate of land from the Bengali Hindus, roughly equivalent to the 45% of the total landed area owned by them.\n\nThe refugee rehabilitation became an acute crisis and hundreds of refugees were rehabilitated in the inhabitable terrains of Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and the Andamans. Apart from that thousands of Bengali Hindus had also immigrated to Assam, Tripura and other regions of the North East. In the Barak Valley region of Assam, where the Bengali Hindus were in a majority because of the inclusion of Sylhet into Pakistan, and subsequent immigration of Bengali Hindus from Sylhet into Cachar, an impasse was arrived at on the question of language. The government of Assam had unilaterally imposed Assamese as the sole medium of education. In response, the Bengali Hindus began peaceful demonstrations demanding Bengali as the optional medium of primary education in the Barak Valley region. The situation took an ugly turn on 19 May 1961, when eleven Bengali Hindu protesters including a minor girl were gunned down by the police at the Silchar railway station. Subsequently, the Assam government allowed Bengali as the medium of education in Barak Valley. However, the rise of ethnic militancy in the eighties and nineties once again made the Bengali Hindus vulnerable in the North East. The United Liberation Front of Asom, National Democratic Front of Bodoland, Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam and National Liberation Front of Tripura militants have selectively targeted the Bengali Hindu people, prompting the latter to form the Bengali Tiger Force.\n\nDiscrimination against Bengali Hindu population is not limited to the North East. In Jharkhand, the Bengali Hindu demand of making Bengali the second official language has not been met, in spite of the fact that the Bengali Hindu population forms the second largest linguistic group in the state. They constitute almost 40 percent of the population in Jharkhand.Most of the Bengalis of Jharkhand are the Bhumiputras or the original settlers in the region.In Bihar, many Bengali Hindu refugees are denied land owning rights and caste certificates. On the other hand, massive infiltration from Bangladesh has substantially altered the demography in West Bengal so much so that Bengal Hindus have been reduced to minorities in the border regions and occasionally, there have been violent clashes between Muslim and Hindu mobs in Bengal.\n\nBengali Hindus constitute a minority ethnic group of the total population in both Bangladesh and India, forming less than 10% of the population in both countries. From the sixties onward, like many other ethnic groups of India, many Bengali Hindus began to emigrate outside India, mostly to pursue higher studies or in search of lucrative careers. This gave rise to a sizeable expatriate Bengali Hindu population in many parts of the world.\n\nBengali Hindus form a majority in West Bengal, with a population of 64,385,546 (70.54%), while in Bangladesh, Bengali Hindus are the second largest community with a population of 14,112,218 (8.03%).\n\nBefore India became independent, the city of Dhaka (present capital of Bangladesh) had a significant number of Bengali Hindus, but their numbers have since considerably dwindled, being outnumbered by Bengali Muslims. Bengali Hindus are at present the second largest community after Muslims in Dhaka at 1,476,184 (7%).\n\nBengali Hindus are the second largest community in Assam with a population of 3 million (9.12%). They are concentrated in the Barak Valley region.As per 2011 census Bengali speaking population of Assam is a little above 91 lakhs, which is about 29% of the total population of Assam. About 31% of the Bengali speaking people are Hindus.\nIn Jharkhand the Bengali Hindu population is 2.5 million (8.09%).\n\nIn Tripura, Bengali hindus form the majority due to immigration of from neighbouring East Pakistan during 1971 as a result Tripura become a Bengali majority state. Bengalis comprise nearly 59.81% of the state population which is around 2.19 million respectively whereas tribals are 40.92% of the state population which is around 1.63 million as of 2011. \n\nThere is also a significant number of Bengali Hindus residing in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, estimated approximately 100,000 comprising 26% of the population. Bengali is also the most widely spoken language in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, despite it lacking official status.\n\nUK has a huge portion of Bengali Hindu population. Former Cricketer Isa Guha and Rhona Mitra are prominent descendants of Bengali Hindu diaspora.\n\nBengali Hindu society used to be caste-oriented throughout centuries and the professional status of men depended exclusively on the hierarchical caste divisions. Some professions such as weaving, pottery, carpentry, blacksmithing etc. have always been carried out by special Hindu caste groups in Bengal. In traditional Bengali Hindu society, nearly every occupation is carried on by a ranked hierarchy of specialised caste groups- not only artisan occupations but also personal and domestic service functions such as barbering, laundering, latrine cleaning as well as non-menial tasks such as priesthood. However, with the introduction of British rule and appearance of urban civilisation, the former rural agrarian and artisan economy gradually crumbled and gave way to modern middle class economy. However, agriculture, land tenure, farming and fishing form the predominant economic activity in most of the rural area till now. A small but significant section of rural people carry out small trades and businesses. In urban and semi-urban areas, most of the people are engaged in business, industry, government and private service sectors, self-employing works and intellectual pursuits. Unemployment has persisted in a certain minuscule section of the community.\n\nThe proper Bengali literary history begins with the early Vaishnava literature like the Shreekrishna Kirtana and the Vaishnava padavalis followed by translation literatures like Ramayana and Srikrishna Vijaya. In the medieval period literary works on the life and teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were composed. This period saw the emergence of Shakta padavalis. The characteristic feature of Bengali Hindu literature in the middle age are the mangalkavyas, that glorify various Hindu gods and goddesses often using folkloristic backgrounds.\n\nThe early modern period saw a flurry in the literary activity especially after the emergence of the Bengali press. The first Bengali prose \"Raja Pratapaditya Charitra\" was written during this time. The Renaissance saw a rapid development in modern Bengali literature. Most of the epics, poems, novels, short stories and dramas of the modern classical literature were written during this period. The Bengal Literary Society that later came to be known as Bangiya Sahitya Parishad was founded. The literary development during the Renaissance culminated in Rabindranath's Nobel prize for literature.\n\nIn the Post-Partition period, the Bengali Hindus pioneered the Hungry generation, \"Natun Kabita\" and the little magazine movements. Of late, some of them have made their mark in contemporary English literature.\n\nThe Kalighat school of painting flourished in Bengal in the early modern period, and especially after the first paper mill was set up in 1809. During the rise of nationalism in the early 20th century, the Bengali Hindus pioneered the Bengal school of art. It provided the artistic medium of expression to the Hindu nationalist movement. Though the Bengal school later gave way to modernist ideas, it left an enduring legacy. In the post-liberalisation phase of India, modern art acquired a new dimension as young artists like Devajyoti Ray, Sudip Roy and Paresh Maity started gaining international recognition. Devajyoti Ray is known for introducing Pseudorealism, which is one of the most original genres of Indian art today.\nThe Bengali Hindus generally follow the beliefs and practices that fall under the broad umbrella of Hinduism. Majority of them follow either the Shakta or the Vaishnava traditions, and some follow a synthesis of the two. The minor traditions include Shaiva etc. A significant minority is atheist who do not follow any rituals. Brahmoism is also found among Bengali Hindus.\n\nApart of the parent tradition, the Bengali Hindus usually affiliate themselves to one of the many sects that have come to be established as institutionalised forms of the ancient guru-shishya traditions.

Coulibaly quickly subdued rival chiefs of Ségou through a vote a cloture of the Chiefs and used the city as a capital for his new Bambara Empire.\n\nFortifying himself with defensive techniques from the Songhai tradition, Coulibaly created a thousand-man army and a navy of war canoes to patrol the Niger River, staffing both with men already captured in his conquests. Coulibaly then proceeded to launch successful assaults against his neighbors, the Fulani, the Soninke, and the Mossi; he also attacked Tomboctou, though he held the city only briefly. During this time he also founded the city of Bla as an outpost and armory. \n\nCoulibaly's new empire thrived on trade with the Berber to the north due to the Islamic influence, including that of local slaves captured in its many wars. The slaves were drafted in the army, used for labor and or resold to African local traders to the south and west (not European Slave trade); the demand for slaves then fueled the empire on to further wars. Note: Slaves had the right to property and could win their way to nobility as Ngolo Diarra did.\n\nBitòn Coulibaly was succeeded by Dinkoro Coulibaly following his death in 1755 and Ali Coulibaly. However, the Coulibalys failed to keep control of the empire, and it fell into anarchy until Ngolo Diarra a slave or servant of Biton Coulibaly seized the throne in 1766.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v9iyfsjGTY\n"}

It was first published in 1962 and has been in print ever since. Boban and Molly, twin brother and sister from the rural environs of central Travancore became popular in Kerala through the Malayala Manorama weekly, which published the strip for almost four decades. After a controversial legal battle between Malayala Manorama and Thomas, \"Boban and Molly\" began to appear as a comic magazine called \"Tom's Magazine\".\n\nToms achieved enormous success and fame through Boban and Molly, and became one of the most influential comic artists in Kerala. According to Toms, the prototypes of Boban and Molly were two naughty kids who stayed next door to his ancestral home in Kuttanad. The themes appear in the comics varies from childish adventures and pranks to contemporary social and political satires. The political and social issues are predominantly discussed in the series produced in the later period.\n\nThe setting the series is at the fictional Kizhukkamthookku village in Central Travancore.\n\nThe main characters of the series, two 12-year-old twins. They hail from a middle class Christian family in central Travancore. It is known that Toms named Boban and Molly after two children in his neighbourhood who one day came to him and asked him to draw their picture. Toms said: “This took place after these two naughty children thwarted every attempt of mine to prevent them from jumping the fence around my house and walking through the kitchen, on their way to school.”\n\nA little dog owned by the Pothan family.

The strips generally narrates the mischievous antics of the six-year-old, who constantly puts his parents and teachers in a spot of trouble. “Unnikkuttan is my best-loved character. Though, over the years, I have created many characters, he has remained the most endearing of them all,” says Toms, revealing that idea for the character came from his elder daughter Molly’s son whose nickname is Unnikkuttan. “My grandson was a prankster, who used to threaten his mother that he would divorce her if she scolded him,” recollects artist Toms.\n\nA hippie in the village ... the romantic guy with a guitar ..\n\nIt was only after an infamous legal battle with Malayala Manorama, the \"Toms Magazine\" came into stands. The controversy became a debating point in the local media and later attracted the attention of the national media.\n\nToms joined Malayala Manorama, the most popular daily in Kerala, as a cartoonist in 1961, and worked there till retiring as an assistant editor in June 1987. After leaving the Malayala Manorama, he started publishing the strip in the magazine Kalakaumudi, against which the Manorama went to court. A local court temporarily restrained Toms and permitted Manorama to continue publication of the Boban and Molly. However, on an appeal, the High Court of Kerala ruled that pursuant to the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, while the ownership of the strips drawn during Toms’ employment with Manorama would continue to be with the publication, Toms was free to own the characters Boban and Molly and could continue to create cartoon strips featuring them and publish them at his will.\n\nIt is said that Toms even influenced the way a Malayali read a magazine — from back to front— thanks to his strip which appeared in the back pages of the Malayala Manorama weekly.\n\n\n"}

Her most recent book, \"Archetypes: Who Are You?\" was published in 2013. She describes herself as a medical intuitive and a mystic.\n\nShe was on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" several times with her first appearance being in 2002. In 2001 she hosted a TV series titled \"The Journey With Caroline Myss\" on the Oxygen (TV network), co-owned by Oprah Winfrey, exploring the spiritual and psychological roadblocks of life in an intimate workshop setting, apart from that she has also done TV Specials, \"Three Levels of Power & How to Use Them\" and \"Why People Don't Heal & How They Can,\" based on her work.\n\nCaroline Myss was born on December 2, 1952, in Chicago and grew up with her parents and two brothers, one elder and one younger, in the Melrose Park, Illinois neighborhood near Chicago. She was raised a Catholic in a large Polish American family, and attended the Mother Guerin High School, River Grove, Illinois, run by the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. She completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from the Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College in Indiana in 1974, and started her career in journalism in Chicago.\n\nDuring the course of her career, she interviewed Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the author of the famous book \"On Death and Dying\", which inspired her to pursue a master's degree in theology from Mundelein College, Chicago, which she completed in 1979. (In 2008, she wrote the foreword to Kübler-Ross's revised version of \"On Life After Death\".)\n\nShe started giving medical intuitive readings in 1982 and co-founded a small New Age publishing company, Stillpoint Publishing in Walpole, New Hampshire, where she also worked as an editor in 1983. Next she began consulting with holistic doctors, which in 1984, led to her extensive collaboration with C. Norman Shealy, physician and founder of the American Holistic Medical Association, with whom she later co-authored \"AIDS: Passageway to Transformation\", in 1987, followed by \"The Creation of Health: The Emotional, Psychological, and Spiritual Responses that Promote Health and Healing\", in 1988. Deriving from her practice as a medical intuitive, she started writing books, in the field of energy medicine, and healing, five of which became New York Times Best Sellers. Starting with \"Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing\" (1996), which overlapped seven Christian sacraments with seven Hindu chakras and the Kabbalah's Tree of Life to create a map of the human \"energy anatomy\"; this was followed by \"Why People Don't Heal and How They Can\" (1998), which explored the reasons people do not heal through her concept of \"woundology.\" Her next book, \"Sacred Contracts: Awakening Your Divine Potential\" (2002) dealt with the issue of finding \"Life Purpose,\" while describing Sacred Contracts as \"a set of assignments that our soul had formed around before incarnation\". She has since appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" numerous times.\n\nBy 2000, she discontinued doing private medical intuitive readings, and began teaching how to do them through her workshops, seminars, radio shows and guided tours. She tours internationally as a speaker on spirituality and mysticism, and lives in Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago. In 2003, she founded the Caroline Myss Educational Institute (CMED) in Chicago, Illinois, with business partner David Smith, offering weekend workshops on her books and teachings.\n\nHer 2007 book, \"Entering the Castle\" draws upon the writings of Saint Teresa of Ávila, a 16th-century Carmelite nun, who wrote her most important work, \"The Interior Castle\" (1577), towards the end of her life. Her next book, \"Defy Gravity, Healing Beyond the Bounds of Reason\" (2009) took the ideas further with mystical laws, the seven shadows and also seven graces inherent in all of us.\n\nIn June 2012, Myss appeared on a \"Super Soul Sunday\" episode with Oprah Winfrey, on OWN Network.\n\nHer first three books have consecutively been on The New York Times Best Seller list: Anatomy of the Spirit (1998), Why People Don't Heal and How They Can (1998), Sacred Contracts (2002)\n\n\n\nMyss started hosting a weekly Call-in Talk radio show, \"Sacred Contracts\" around 2005, at Hay House Radio, an Internet radio site, run by Hay House publishing, where she gave online intuitive readings to callers. Then in 2009, the show was renamed \"Defy Gravity\" after her book by the same name was released in October 2009.\n\nIn Michael Shermer's book \"The Skeptic: Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience\", Phil Molé says \"Caroline Myss offers no tangible evidence to support any of her claims. Her hypothetical energy system cannot be detected, her intuitive diagnostic abilities are unproven, and her holistic philosophy is riddled with inconsistencies and unsubstantiated judgments.\"\n\nJoe Nickell, a paranormal investigator, says, \"Myss provides no proof of her alleged abilities. She intuits, of course, her intuitive power, offers only hearsay testimonials and anecdotal evidence as support.\" He has also described Myss as having \"many of the traits associated with a fantasy prone personality.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

She had three brothers Arthur, Daniel, and George who made a fortune in shipping during the U.S. Civil War. Arthur was a bachelor who Annie accompanied to society functions in New York City as well as Newport, Rhode Island. It has been suggested that James friendship with the Astors is what led to Arthur and in turn Annie's being the only Catholics to be included on Caroline Astor's \"The 400\". When Arthur died she inherited his fortune as well as his social prominence and recognition via the aforementioned 400 list.\n\nComing into large sums of money Annie Leary soon became an ardent philanthropist. Among her notable bequests was the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament at Bellevue Hospital (dedicated 1897 - razed 1938 in order to make way for a Bellevue administration building which encompasses a new chapel where the original stained glass panels including nine made in Munich remain today) the first Catholic chapel at Bellevue.

It turned out however that the management of her will was delegated to a niece of hers who was not fond of the departed philanthropist and the money was never given to the aforementioned clergyman. Legal action therefore followed, and by the time the will was resolved in 1926 there was no money left to pay for the vault.

A diagnosis of Type I diabetes at an early age ended her athletic career; a 1982 article in \"People\" magazine reported that Hill, at age 10, had placed third nationwide in the 880-yard run and fourth in the mile run. A few weeks later, she collapsed on the track, which resulted in her medical diagnosis. The diabetes affected her growth and caused lifelong health complications.\n\nDespite her father's strong discouragement, Hill’s initial work was in commercials (her first job was a 1973 commercial for the YMCA, spinning a basketball on her finger with Boston Celtics center Dave Cowens). However, to avoid the appearance of nepotism, she used her mother's maiden name and devoted herself to acting as a career. She appeared in guest roles on such programs as \"Family\" before landing a major role on the 1981–1982 CBS series \"The Two of Us\" as Gabrielle \"Gabby\" Gallagher. While filming this series, the 17-year-old Hill would sometimes be pulled over by the police while driving to the studio because she looked too young to drive.\n\nHer breakthrough role was in the 1981 made-for-TV movie \"Fallen Angel\".

A former journalist, she became the first woman directly elected to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the 1991 LegCo elections. She served as Legislative Councillor for the New Territories East throughout the 1990s and 2000s until she stepped down in 2016. She was also the chairperson of the Democratic Party.\n\nLau was born on 21 January 1952. Her family moved to Hong Kong from the Guangdong in 1948 during the Chinese Civil War. In 1962, her family transferred her to the then new English-language Maryknoll Sisters' School in Happy Valley, where she studied until 1972. When she was in primary school, she was given the English name Emily by her aunt.\n\nLau travelled to the United States to study journalism studies at the University of Southern California from 1973 to 1976 and graduated with a B.A. in Broadcast Journalism. She later cited the Watergate scandal and investigative journalism having had a major formative effect on her views on the role and potential of the press.\n\nAfter returning Hong Kong, Lau worked between 1976 and 1978 as a reporter for the \"South China Morning Post\", the major English-language newspaper in Hong Kong. She then moved into television journalism when she joined the Television Broadcasts (TVB) and promoted to senior producer in 1981. She furthered her studies in the early 1980s at the London School of Economics and completed an MSc in International Relations in 1982, then followed a position as an assistant producer within the BBC from 1982 to 1984, while concurrently working as the London correspondent of Hong Kong TVB News.\n\nIt was the time the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom discussed over the fate of Hong Kong after 1997. She later noted, \"My passion for politics began to develop in 1982, when China told Britain that it would impose a settlement on Hong Kong if the two sides could not reach an agreement by 1984. From that moment, politics began to matter.\"\n\nEmily Lau returned to Hong Kong as Hong Kong correspondent of the Hong Kong-based \"Far Eastern Economic Review\" in 1984. The position allowed her access and insights into the politics of the colonial Hong Kong. During the time Lau took up position at the Journalism and Communication Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 1987 and subsequently at the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Hong Kong (HKU).\n\nIn December 1984, after signing the Sino-British Joint Declaration, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher flew to Hong Kong to give a press conference. Lau questioned Thatcher, \"Prime Minister two days ago you signed an agreement with China promising to deliver over 5 million people into the hands of a communist dictatorship. Is that morally defensible, or is it really true that in international politics the highest form of morality is one's own national interest?\" Thatcher replied by saying that everyone in Hong Kong was happy with the agreement, and Lau may be a solitary exception.\n\nShe also involved with the Hong Kong Journalists Association during this period, serving as an executive committee member, vice-chair and later on chairperson from 1989 to 1991.\n\nWhen the direct elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) were first introduced in the 1991 elections, Lau resigned from her posts and ran for office in the New Territories East geographical constituency (GC). She campaigned for five months as a new breed of populist politicians in Hong Kong who can appeal wide range of Hong Kong populace. The elections saw with a liberal landslide victory, she became the first woman elected in direct elections along with other pro-democracy politicians of the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK), largely due to the fear of Hong Kong populace towards Beijing after the Tiananmen massacre in early June 1989.\n\nIn this period, Lau became a household name in Hong Kong and the legislator came to be both a champion of her constituents and a perceived thorn in the side of the Hong Kong administration. She was equally a critic of Britain and Beijing. The last British Governor Chris Patten aimed at a faster pace of democratisation. Governor Patten carried out the reform packages which enfranchised millions electorates in the functional constituency indirect elections. Although the reform packages were ferociously criticised by Beijing government for violating the Sino-British agreements, she introduced a private member's bill which would even allow all 60 Legislative Council seats to be directly elected in 1995. The bill was beaten by only one vote.\n\nIn 1993, Lau tabled a motion to seek assurances of right of abode in Britain for the British National (Overseas) passport holders if expelled from Hong Kong after 1997. The motion was supported by 36 legislators but was rejected by the Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey. In October 1994, Lau led legislators in urging Britain to grant full citizenship to 3.5 million native Hong Kong British Dependent Territories Citizens (BDTC). As the situation intensified, she led a cross-party delegation of Hong Kong legislators to Britain to lobby government and opposition politicians ahead of the LegCo debate. The five councillors met the British Foreign Secretary and other senior officials, but achieved little.\n\nIn the 1995 Legislative Council elections, Lau was re-elected to the legislature by popular vote, winning with 58.51 percent of votes cast, the highest figure among all the geographical constituencies. Growing disillusionment with the Democratic Party, the pro-democracy party formed and succeeded the United Democrats of Hong Kong in 1994, and other liberal forces, Lau founded a new political grouping, The Frontier, in August 1996 which took a more aggressively pro-democracy, pro-human rights and anti-Communist Party stances and left wing positions on economic matters. Lau became the Convenor of the party, having five legislators and becoming the fourth largest political grouping in the legislature in the run up to handover. Lau remained in the Legislative Council until it was disbanded by the PRC following the handover on 1 July 1997.\n\nLau also participated in street protests, and in December 1996 scuffled with riot police outside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre with Andrew Cheng, Lee Cheuk-yan while demonstrating outside the closed-door election for the post-handover Chief executive. She was arrested within 29 other pro-democracy activists. Over the following several months leading up to the July 1997 handover, Lau urged the Chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa to stand up against Beijing, following his \"unreserved support\" for the Beijing-hand-picked Provisional Legislative Council abolishing or modifying some Hong Kong laws covering human rights and civil liberties. In March, Lau called for boycott of Hong Kong's future first election under PRC rule if the voting system was unfair and the proportional representation favoured pro-Beijing candidates.\n\nShe was required to relinquish her British passport and adopt Chinese citizenship in order to be eligible to run for the first Legislative Council elections after the handover in 1998. The pro-democracy camp won 63 percent of the popular vote and Lau was returned again to the Legislative Council through New Territories East which she remained in until her retirement.\nLau led The Frontier at the forefront of pressure on the government for early democratisation and was an outspoken critic on human rights and a number of other policy areas in the HKSAR; she was sceptical of the functioning of the \"One country, two systems\" principle. Beside pushing for tightened human rights protection, greater efforts on equal opportunities, and the establishment of a statutory right to access to information, she demanded a redraft of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitutional document, and democratisation in China. On the economy she supported legislation on fair trading, oppose importation of foreign labour, and called for a minimum wage. Lau received the Bruno Kreisky Award for her human rights work in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, Lau sued the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua News Agency over its slow response to her queries for personal information. She lost the case and was ordered by the court to pay legal fees of HK$1.6 million. Claiming that her lawsuit was in the public interest, she attempted to raise funds from the public to repay the debt. In December 2000, with over $1 million still outstanding, the agency (now the Central People's Government Liaison Office) applied to the court for her bankruptcy.\n\nIn the 2002 Chief executive election, Lau was against supporting an alternative candidate as some pro-democracy allies argued: \"As it is not a fair, open and democratic election, we should not participate in it and give it any legitimacy.\" Lau co-founded the Coalition Against Second Term (CAST) to draw attention to the flawed process of choosing the Chief executive, the lack of competition and the need for real democracy. \n\nOn international issues, Lau is supportive of self-determination for Taiwan. In 2003, she and another legislator, James To of the Democratic Party, attended a seminar entitled \"Hong Kong Under One Country, Two Systems\" organised by a pro-Taiwan independence group headed by former ROC President Lee Teng-hui. Lau stated that \"Taiwan's future should be determined by the Taiwan people themselves\". Her subsequent refusal to explicitly recognise Taiwan as a part of the PRC during an interview again drew criticism from more conservative sectors of the Hong Kong society, including attacks from pro-Beijing politician Leung Chun-ying, who became Chief executive in 2012.\n\nBeside her legal problems, Lau has been the victim of several criminal nuisance cases, including telephone nuisance to her office in January and October 2003, and two cases where food and/or faeces were splashed outside her office in Shatin in July and September 2003. A woman and an old man were arrested and fined in connection with some of these cases. Most notably, an arson attack against Lau's office took place on 21 June 2004. Posters outside her office, about an upcoming rally, were burned. Words were left saying \"All Chinese traitors must die.\"\n\nShe fiercely opposed to the controversial national security bill in 2002 and 2003 to meet requirements of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23. After the 2003 July 1 march in 2003, she was listed second on the joint-candidate list with other pro-democrats in the New Territories East and was elected to the Legislative Council elections in 2004 Legislative Council elections. She was elected chairwoman of the Legislative Council Finance Committee and had chaired for occasions until 2012.\n\nIn the Chief executive election held in 2005 after unpopular Tung Chee-hwa stepped down, Lau announced her interest in running for the post to raise the discussion over Hong Kong's democratic development. Due to the opposition from secretary-general Andrew To and other members of the Frontier, Lau did not run in the election. Democratic Party chairman Lee Wing-tat became the only pro-democratic candidate in the election, but did not secure the threshold of 100 nominations.\n\nAt the time of her election to LegCo in 1991, Lau was generally considered to be the most radical legislator. However her radical image was overshadowed by activist Leung Kwok-hung and other radicals with her popular votes continuously declined. After the 2008 LegCo elections in September which saw Emily Lau was re-elected in New Territories East with the fewest votes, the Frontier merged into the more mainstream Democratic Party in November and Lau immediately became one of its two vice-chairpersons. After The Frontier merged into the Democratic Party, her earlier strident stance toward the Beijing government and opposition to pro-Beijing supporters mellowed somewhat, and was seen by some even to have been compromised.\n\nOn 24 May 2010, Emily Lau and Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho and veteran Cheung Man-kwong met with Beijing representatives headed by Li Gang, the deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong – the first meeting between Democratic Party leaders and senior officials from the central government since the Tiananmen protests of 1989 – for negotiations over 2012 constitutional reform package. In June 2010, as vice-chairperson of Democratic Party, she voted with her party in favour of the government's reform package, which included the party's late amendment – accepted by Beijing – to hold a popular vote for five new District Council (second) functional constituencies. She has been surpassed by the radical democrats, such as Leung Kwok-hung and Wong Yuk-man, and is the main target for attacks by Wong and People Power.\n\nIn September 2012, the Democratic Party suffered the worst defeat in party's history in the 2012 Legislative Council election. Chairman Albert Ho resigned as chairman and Lau became acting Chairperson of the party for three months. In the party leadership election on 16 December 2012, she was elected chairperson, narrowly defeating vice-chairman Sin Chung-kai, by 149 votes to 133, becoming the first female leader of the party since its formation in 1994.\n\nLau and other Democratic Party members supported the 2014 Hong Kong protests by taking a supporting role. On 11 December 2014, Lau was arrested by the police with a group of about a hundred demonstrators staging a final sit-in which included other prominent democratic legislators including Martin Lee and Alan Leong, putting an end to a 75-day street occupation.\n\nOn 14 December 2014, she was re-elected chairperson in the party leadership election, beating three rivals in the party's 20-year history.\n\nOn 1 January 2016, she announced that she would not seek for an eighth term in the September election after 25 years service on the Legislative Council as she did not field her nomination in the party primary. She ran as a second candidate on his younger colleague, Lam Cheuk-ting's candidate list, and helped him to get elected with nearly 40,000 votes.\n\nLau announced her retirement from the party chair in December 2016 and was succeeded by legislator Wu Chi-wai. She also relinquished all the party position afterward. She remained hosting her interview programme after her retirement, inviting different political heavyweights on her shows occasionally.\n\nLau has been considered politician with strong conviction on promotion of democracy human rights and equal opportunities in Hong Kong. She was considered by the Hong Kong government as \"radical\", \"outside mainstream public opinion\" and a \"solitary exception\". She was among the most popular legislators throughout the 1990s. The last British Governor Chris Patten regarded Lau as a \"professional politician, handsome, well informed and dashingly eloquent, who would have got to the top in any Western political system\" and an \"exponent of the incisive soundbite.\"\n\nSince she joined the Democratic Party, her earlier strident stance toward the Beijing government was seen by some even to have been compromised. After she met with the mainland officials and for negotiations over 2012 constitutional reform package and voted with her party in favour of the reform package, she was under ferocious attacks from the radical democrats for the compromise.\n\nLau married John Ball, a British journalist from the \"Sunday Times\", in 1983. The marriage lasted two years. She remarried to a Hong Kong lawyer, Winston Poon, QC in 1989 after they met in London during her visit to discuss the Hong Kong Basic Law with the members of Parliament of the United Kingdom. In 2006, she changed her marital status to unmarried with the Legislative Council office.\n\nStephen Lau Sing-hung, Emily Lau's brother was a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Guangzhou committee member in the 1980s, chairman of Ernst & Young's tax service before he left in 2006 and chief executive of China Timber Resources Group from 2007 to 2010. Despite her sister's political stance, he sued Occupy Central organiser Benny Tai in the 2014 Hong Kong protests for HK$314.60 in the Small Claims Tribunal as he had to spend HK$320 for a taxi ride on 6 October instead of just HK$5.40 for bus fare from his home in Wong Nai Chung Gap Road to Central because of the occupation movement. Emily Lau said she was not aware of her brother's action but insisted the family is not affected by the action.\n\n\n"}

He is considered one of top intellectuals of the Francoist era, though not necessarily of Francoism. As theorist of law he represented the school known as \"iusnaturalismo\", as historian of political ideas he focused mostly on Hispanidad, and as theorist of politics he pursued a Traditionalist approach. As a Carlist he remained an ideologue rather than a political protagonist.\n\nThe Tejada family originated from Genoa; its branch moved to Naples and in the late Middle Ages to the Spanish La Rioja, settling at Muro de Cameros. In the early modern period its descendants transferred to Extremadura and few generations later they were already considered extremeños. Francisco’s distant ancestor was the 17th-century knight Sancho de Tejada, whose son Elías excelled during the siege of Breda and got his name incorporated into the family surname. In the early 19th century the family, referred to as terratenientes hidalgos, held estates mostly in Castuera and Zalamea de la Serena. Francisco’s grandfather made his name as a lawyer. Francisco's father, José Maria Elías de Tejada y de la Cueva (1891-1970), also practiced as abogado in Castuera. In 1913 he married Encarnación Spínola Gómez (1891-1953), heir to a wealthy local landowners family. It was at her Rinconada estate near Granja de Torrehermosa where Francisco and his only brother spent most of their childhood, raised in the profoundly Catholic ambience. Though born in Madrid, he considered Extremadura his mother region.\n\nSince early childhood consuming sophisticated books and gifted with excellent memory, the young Francisco was first educated in the Jesuit college of Nuestra Señora de Recuerdo in the Madrid quarter of Chamartin. After its premises were and the order was expulsed soon afterwards, he continued his learning in the Portuguese Estremoz, still with the Jesuits. In 1933 Tejada obtained bachillerato, nostrified by University of Seville. Inspired by his Jesuit mentor Fernando María de Huidobro he decided to study law, though at in Madrid he pursued also philosophy and letters. Having graduated in both in 1935 he left to study in Germany. Outbreak of the Civil War caught him in Berlin; Tejada returned to Spain to learn that tens of his relatives were executed by the Republicans in Granja. In September in Calera de la Sierra he enlisted to Nationalist troops, first advancing to Toledo and then as artillery man serving during the battle of Madrid. In February 1937 he was admitted to Alféreces Provisionales school in Seville, soon abandoned due to health reasons. In May 1937 he intended to join aviation, but in August he was nominated alférez asimilado at a logistics unit in Seville, remaining at this post until the end of the war.\n\nThough described as heavily attracted to females, Elías de Tejada married as late as in 1962, at the age of 45. He wed an Italian 20 years his junior, Gabriella Pèrcopo Calet (1937-1986), descendant to a distinguished Neapolitan family of immense intellectual heritage, fluent in Spanish, perfectly familiar with the Spanish cultural realm and the PhD herself. Throughout the rest of his life she supported Tejada on all possible fields, as a secretary, proofreader, editor, erudite partner, co-author, organizer, academic inspiration and a soul mate. The couple had no children. Francisco Elías de Tejada Lozano, a Spanish diplomat in the 21st century serving as ambassador and high Foreign Ministry official, is descendant to Elías’ brother.\n\nAlready in 1935 Tejada was nominated Profesor Ayudante de Derecho Político in Madrid, an assignment held shortly as he soon left for Germany. When in the Nationalist army he was giving lectures at letters and philosophy courses organized by Universidad de Sevilla, in 1939 publishing his first works. Having obtained PhD laurels thanks to a thesis on , in 1939 Tejada returned to Madrid as Professor Ayudante to assist Nicolás Pérez Serrano at Derecho Político. In 1940 he applied for chair of philosophy of law in Seville and Oviedo, but during the he was defeated by counter-candidates; referees described him as erudite and brilliant speaker, but also disoriented, immature, not adhering to the point, lacking reflexive spirit, excessively lyrical and repetitive. Also in 1940 Tejada left to pursue research abroad, having the unique opportunity to compare the early wartime realm in Berlin and in Oxford.\n\nIn March 1941 Tejada won the contest for chair of Derecho Natural y Filosofía del Derecho in Murcia; in 1942 he moved to Salamanca, having been the only contender. In 1951 he swapped chairs with Joaquín Ruiz Giménez Cortés and left for Seville, where he headed philosophy of law for the next 26 years, periodically chairing also the history of ideas. However, except the 1960-1961 course he spent the 1956-1964 period mostly pursuing research in Naples, with massive admin gimmicks on part of the University to find a legal framework for such a lengthy stay. Since 1964 he worked under the dedicación exclusiva contract. In 1969 nominated consejero honorario del Consejo Nacional de Educación, though his academic relations with the Francoist education authorities remained thorny.\n\nSince the early 1970s Tejada intended to move to Madrid, but his 1971 and 1974 bids for Complutense failed. His 1975 bid for Universidad Autónoma took an awkward turn, when Tejada challenged the referees appointed as linguistically incompetent. His protest was dismissed and in 1976 he lost to , appealing the decision; the issue was not settled before his death. However, in 1977 he was appointed with no contest to cátedra de Derecho Natural y Filosofía del Derecho at Complutense; death interrupted his first course in Madrid.\n\nThough member of a number of scientific institutions around the world, recipient of a few doctor honoris causa titles, a vastly prolific author and during his lifetime himself subject of 4 PhD dissertations, Tejada did not make it to the top elite of Spanish law scholars and did not enter Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislación. There are conflicting accounts of his standing in the academic realm. Some claim that he was universally highly regarded as doctrinally intransigent but pro-student open-minded, tolerant scholar, as demonstrated by his supervision of PhD bid of Enrique Tierno Galván, the future key PSOE politician. Others present him as a feared „inquisidor”, extremely quarrelsome hypocrite pursuing private goals and eager to call security when dealing with manifestations of student dissent towards him.\n\nTejada is considered member of the natural law school and its key representative during the Franco era, influenced by early modern Spanish jurists like Francisco Suarez but mostly following the Aquinas; he regarded own work merely a gloss to the opus of St. Thomas. Hence, within iusnaturalismo he is classified as representative of Neo-Scholastic school, as opposed to Axiological, Neo-Kantian and Innovative Natural Law schools. Together with deemed a renovator of classical European iusnaturalismo of the mid-20th century, Tejada clearly distinguished own vision from \"iusnaturalismo racionalista\". Within this framework, he agreed that the role of jurisprudence was discovering rather than inventing.\n\nTejada's work consisted of systematizing concepts falling into ontology, anthropology, logic and axiology. His original contribution was merging them into a complete system and introducing a set of own concepts. He is considered not a mere follower but a scholar who developed Thomist juridical philosophy, credited for attempting a synthesis with existentialist school; some even view him as representative of legal Catholic Existentialism, a definition not accepted universally. He is noted as the moving spirit behind emergence of Asociación Internacional de Iusnaturalistas Hispánicos \"Felipe II\". Last but not least, Tejada is acknowledged as the one who inspired a number of scholars, both in Spain and in wider Hispanic realm, though not all his proposals have been accepted by his followers.\nFor Tejada the law resulted from God assuming a decisive role, but rendering it possible to find acceptable reasons for an objective-value-based human agency; natural law stemmed from conjunction of divine power and human liberty. Its purpose was twofold: salvation and vocation, corresponding to justice in relations to God and security in relations to other people. Though some scholars point to some confusion as to the terms used, most agree that for Tejada law was \"la norma política con contenido justo\", colloquially described as where politics and ethics overlapped, a sovereign normative system related but clearly separate from religion. Some students conclude that Tejada was close to normativism, others find this suggestion too restrictive and claim that for him, law was far more than a norm. A distinctive thread of his jurisprudential discourse was its application to vastly distinct cultural realms, though he attempted to sublimate a specific Hispanic natural law.\n\nTejada kept writing on theory of law throughout all of his academic career; his first contribution was published in 1942 and his new pieces are being published posthumously. Except two volumes of \"Historia de la filosofía del derecho y del Estado\" (1946), until the very late of his life Tejada’s works were mostly articles in specialized reviews, lectures delivered at jurisprudential conferences or compendium-like textbooks intended for students. Tejada's vastly erudite opus magnum, a systematic in-depth lecture gathering all his ideas on law theory was \"Tratado de filosofia del derecho\", published in Seville in two volumes respectively in 1974 and 1977. It is not clear how many of his almost 400 works fall into theory of law, though their number might near one hundred.\n\nAs historian of political ideas Tejada clearly focused on broad Hispanic realm: he published studies on Castile, Catalonia, Navarre, Vascongadas, Extremadura, Valencia and Galicia, produced works intended as synthetic accounts for Spain and Portugal, dedicated separate works to Franche-Comté, Sardinia, Naples, Sicily, Flanders and Malta and wrote on Hispanic Florida, Texas and California, Portuguese holdings in Africa and Asia, the Philippines, Chile, Brazil, Colombia and Latin America in general. However, his comparatistic zeal made him discuss history of political thought also beyond the Lusitanic and Hispanic realm, e.g. in England, Arabic and Sephardic traditions, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Hungary, Japan, Thailand, Borneo, Ethiopia, Mozambique and elsewhere.\n\nTejada strove to reconstruct and define a Hispanic political tradition and vacillated between the role of historian and theorist. His understanding of Hispanidad was based on the concept of Las Españas, seen as embodied in confederal political shape but its essence having been pre-state commonality. Relying on the unity in diversity recipé and incorporating local traditions, including the fueros, Hispanic tradition consisted of two features: Catholic vision of life combined with missionary universalist spirit pursued by a federative monarchy. According to Tejada Hispanidad was born in the Middle Ages, climaxed during the early España de los Austrias and declined due to centralist French tradition imported by the Borbones. His recurring subject was confronting Hispanic and European traditions, the latter born out of anti-Catholic, revolutionary, modernist thought and ultimately responsible for breaking the Hispanic community by force.\n\nTejada understood political thought as a vehicle of sustaining tradition and ignored the imperial and ethnic dimensions of Hispanidad. He viewed the Hispanic political community as forged by will of the people forming its components, not as a result of conquest. Ethnic features were merely means of transmitting heritage and a nation was defined as commonality of tradition, as opposed to positivist definitions focusing on features like language, geography, regime etc.; it enabled implantation of Hispanidad in vastly different settings of the Philippines, Uruguay or Franche-Comté. Tejada saw the Hispanic tradition against a decisively providential background, e.g. when confronting Islam, Protestantism or the New World; scholars saw this approach as indebted to the vision of Giambattista Vico. Another frequently applied personal comparison was that to Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo: the two shared passion for Hispanic patrimony, massive erudition, reconstructive profile and Traditionalist leaning; Tejada’s approach is dubbed \"menéndezpelayismo\".\n\nTejada's first work on history of political thought appeared in 1937 and the last ones in 1977. Unlike in case of theory of law, he did not produce a synthesis which would stand out; his thought is scattered across countless books, articles or minor opuscolos. Single works to be listed first are perhaps case studies, the monumental \"Nápoles hispánico\" (1958-1964) and an unfinished \"Historia del pensamiento político catalán\" (1963-1965). Publications attempting more general overview to be named are \"La causa diferenciadora de las comunidades políticas\" (1943), \"Las Españas\" (1948) and \"Historia de la literatura política en las Españas\" (1952, published 1991).\n\nInitially Tejada developed a Hispanidad-oriented leadership theory of authoritarian state; according to some in the early 1940s he performed a volte-face becoming a vehement anti-Francoist, according to the others during decades to come his theory was progressively dissociated from Francoism, some see 3 phases of his evolution and some advance rambling summaries. Some scholars highlight 1938-1940 works and consider him „superfascista”, most students tend to downplay caudillaje-related writings and focusing on the 1942-1978 period see Tejada as a Traditionalist; few advance an in-between option of \"franquismo neotradicionalista\". Among those supporting the Traditionalist tag many consider him \"maximo representante del pensamiento tradicionalista español en la segunda mitad del siglo XX\" or at least one of the key ones, though some present him as a second-rank theorist.\n\nTejada perceived Traditionalism as a unique Spanish response to the 1515-1648 rupture in European political thought; the latter afterwards degenerated into absolutism, liberalism, totalitarism, and most recently into secular, parliamentarian, free-market, nation-state democracies. Traditionalism itself was politically best embodied in Carlism. Its essence was threefold. First, it consisted of Catholic unity; some scholars claim that Tejada was opposed to religious liberty, others maintain that he was opposed to equality of faiths and advocated a state-endorsed Catholic orthodoxy. Second, it embraced historical, social, accountable, representative, foral, federative, missionary, organic and hereditary monarchy. Third, it was based on a subsidiary state model. The latter marked total reversal from original Tejada's penchant for omnipotent leadership and reflected the Traditionalist logic of state serving society, society serving man, and man serving God. A de-centralized withdrawn state, with is functions reduced, is to provide merely a framework for communities making it up, developed historically and safeguarded by separate legal establishments; The communities in question are to be governed by autonomous intermediary bodies and should participate in state politics represented in the Cortes by delegates of various \"gremios, hermandades, agrupaciones, cámaras, comunidades y cofradías\"; Tejada juxtaposed Spanish communitarian fueros against the French individual liberties. According to some, the proposal advanced by Tejada was intended as a discussion how Spain should look like after Franco.\n\nTejada's works on theory of politics are visibly less numerous than those on theory of law or on history of political thought; moreover, some of them resemble political manifestos rather than scholarly writings. Preceded by caudillaje-oriented brochures of the late 1930s, the main body of his Traditionalism was laid out mostly in the 1950s, following activity in Academia Vazquez de Mella; its most complete and straightforward lecture was \"La monarquía tradicional\" (1954), though some, like \"El tradicionalismo político español\", remained in manuscript. The vision was further refined in details in the 1960s, especially during Congresses of Traditionalist Studies and systematically revisited in the early 1970s, mostly as result of political struggle taking place within Carlism: a lengthy manuscript was reduced into a manual-styled script - officially co-authored with Rafael Gambra Ciudad and - \"¿Qué es el carlismo?\" (1971), with late re-workings and compilations published either shortly before death or posthumously.\n\nSome authors maintain that there were no Carlist antecedents in the Tejada family; however, records reveal that a Justiniano Elías de Tejada, though initially opposing designs in the 1860s, in the early 1870s turned president of Junta Carlista de Castuera and was even subject to jokes because of that. Francisco himself claimed he had joined at the age of 15, remained a Carlist during his adolescence and in 1936 returned from Germany to enlist to the Nationalist army responding to the call of his king, Alfonso Carlos, though he provided also conflicting or confusing accounts.\n\nNothing is known about Tejada political activity during the Civil War and soon afterwards; though seconded to a Falangist unit, he is not mentioned as engaged in Carlist, Falangist or other party structures until the early 1940s. However, his writings published in 1938-1939 clearly identified him as enthusiast of national syndicalism and the caudillaje system; some consider him concerned primarily with justifying the regime. He admitted great juvenile admiration for Hitler. It was the second stay in Germany in 1940 that got him disillusioned with omnipotent state and single party; his 1940 article discussing caudillaje was notably tuned down and introduced a cautious tone. In the early 1940s he was assuming an increasingly dissenting stance. In 1942 he referred to \"misería\" of the Francoist system; the same year he was briefly detained for opposing subscriptions to División Azul. Though he had no chance to publish writings lambasting the system as anti-Catholic tyranny, Tejada made little secret of his views and in the Salamanca law faculty he voted against granting Franco doctorado honoris causa. In 1944 a Falangist hit-squad stormed into his house, dragged him to the nearby Retiro park and left him beaten unconscious.\n\nIn the mid 1940s Tejada again neared Carlism, at that time with no king, divided into few factions and politically bewildered. First commencing co-operation with their periodicals, in the Madrid cafes he mixed with Carlists of different persuasions, including the pro-collaborationist Carloctavistas and the intransigent orthodox Javieristas; he also took part in their minor public manifestations against the regime. In unspecified circumstances, though most likely acting in agreement if not on request of the then Carlist political leader Manuel Fal Conde, Tejada ventured to co-organize a semi-official Traditionalist cultural network, which materialized as the Madrid Academia Vázquez de Mella; in the late 1940s he was among its most active lecturers. Now openly confronting the regime and in 1947 advocating a \"no\" vote in the Ley de Sucesión referendum, politically Tejada avoided clear identification with any of the Carlist groupings. He seemed closest to supporters of Dom Duarte Nuño de Braganza as a potential Carlist heir; according to other sources he merely considered the Portuguese claimant a viable candidate. The period of vacillation ended in 1950, when Tejada aligned with the Javieristas and accepted seat in their national executive, in 1951 nominated by Don Javier commissioner of Comunión Tradicionalista external affairs.\n\nIn the early 1950s Tejada got firmly engaged in mainstream Carlism and demonstrated an uncompromising political stand. He lambasted the dissenting Carloctavistas, complained to Fal about permissive, increasingly Christian-Democratic profile of a semi-official Carlist daily \"Informaciones\", and advocated that Don Javier goes bold by terminating the long overdue regency. He co-drafted \"Declaración de Barcelona\", the statement which was issued by Don Javier in 1952 and which indeed announced his own claim to the Carlist throne, though the episode is not entirely clear. With the 1954 publication of \"La monarquía tradicional\" Tejada became the top Carlist theorist; the same year within the party top body, Junta Nacional, he formed part of Comisión de Cultura y Propaganda. At that time he was considered among key politicians of Carlism.\n\nWhen in 1955 Fal Conde was released from Jefatura and when Carlism abandoned intransigent opposition to the regime in favor of cautious co-operation, Tejada was left puzzled. He did not hesitate to voice his doubts about collaboratice strategy advocated by the new leader Jose Maria Valiente, yet he decided to comply and accepted appointment to the newly formed Secretariat; moreover, at one point he suggested that the body be dissolved as ineffective and replaced by Valiente's personal jefatura. Executing the rapprochement policy he did not believe in its success and was getting increasingly frustrated by Franco’s rejection of the Carlist offer. However, he readily engaged in new formats of activity, now permitted by the regime: Tejada was active in the Carlist publishing house Ediciones Montejurra and became its director, animated the elitist Traditionalist periodical \"Reconquista\", contributed to new periodicals like \"Azada y Asta\" and especially threw himself into organizing Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella, a semi-official Carlist institutional network. In 1960 he entered Comision de Cultura of the Carlist executive and advocated setting up an \"Instituto de Estudios Jurídicos\".\n\nHaving moved on longtime scientific research mission to Italy, at the turn of the decades Tejada was getting increasingly detached from daily Carlist politics. Within the Secretariat and numerous cultural outposts he was somewhat sidetracked by a new breed of young activists forming the entourage of prince Carlos Hugo. Though he knew some, especially their leader Ramón Massó, from the Academia Vázquez de Mella years of the 1940s, Tejada developed grave doubts about Carlist orthodoxy and genuine intentions of the hugocarlistas, suspecting them of pursuing a hidden agenda. Co-operation deteriorated into crisis and then open conflict in the early 1960s, when Don Carlos Hugo started to sidetrack most hard-line Traditionalists. Tejada did not illude himself about Don Javier potentially confronting his progressist son, and in July 1962 he decided to break with the Borbón-Parmas; some authors claim that he was expulsed. He declared to Don Carlos Hugo that he could not make him king, but could prevent him from becoming one. In 1963 Tejada already referred to Don Carlos Hugo as \"este aventurero francés de sangre bastarda\".\n\nAfter the breakup Tejada did not join any Carlist faction, though he was reportedly sympathetic to RENACE: he liked its format of depositary of Traditionalist values with no support for any specific claimant. He embarked on building a network of institutions marketing orthodox Traditionalism. In 1963 he co-founded the Madrid-based Centro de Estudios Históricos y Políticos General Zumalacárregui; though officially affiliated with Secretariado General de Movimiento Nacional, it was intended as a Carlist think-tank. Its activity climaxed in two Congresos de Estudios Tradicionalistas, staged in 1964 and 1968; Centro issued also periodicals and organized so-called Jornadas Forales across the country.\n\nIn the first half of the 1960s Tejada emerged as chief ideologue of Juntas de Defensa del Carlismo, network mushrooming across the country and united by opposition to hugocarlismo; he also contributed to launch of a new periodical, \"Siempre\". In mid-1960s Tejada was firmly established among leaders of loosely organized followers of orthodox Traditionalism; his activity was increasingly leaning towards vague dynastical compromise, intended to block the Borbón-Parmas; this strategy led him close to Carloctavistas and Sivattistas. In 1966 he supported referendum on Ley Organica, considering it a stepping stone towards a Traditionalist ideal; despite this, some scholars dub him \"isolated anti-regime sniper\". In 1968 Franco, always keen to exploit differences, received Tejada to discuss the monarchical question; during their only personal meeting, the dictator was treated to legitimist discourse reverting to the Braganza solution.\n\nThe turn of the decades spelled a political disaster for Tejada: the Alfonsist pretender was nominated as the future king and Carlism was firmly taken over by the hugocarlistas. On the official front, in 1972 he was trialed for anti-government remarks. On the Carlist front, his 1971 last-minute doctrinal summary, \"¿Qué es el carlismo?\", made the Traditionalist position crystal clear, but failed to prevent transformation of Javierismo into the socialist-dominated Partido Carlista. During last years of Francoism he witnessed and indeed contributed to increasing decomposition of Traditionalism. In 1972 he was skeptical about launching an anti-hugocarlista organization on the Requeté basis and ridiculed its leaders, attracting some criticism in return. However, he engaged in another anti-hugocarlista initiative, Real Tercio de Requetés de Castilla, and neared the youngest of the Borbón-Parmas, Don Sixto, considered even his intellectual mentor. In 1975 he accepted Don Sixto as royal leader, though neither as a claimant nor regent but as a vaguely styled \"abanderado de la Tradición\".\n\nIn bitter public skirmishes with partisans of Partido Carlista, following death of Franco Tejada attempted to build a new Carlist organization, born in 1977 as Comunión Católico-Monárquica-Legitimista. During the electoral campaign it joined forces with Unión Nacional Española and Fuerza Nueva in ; Tejada was scheduled to run from the Seville list for the Senate. When leaders of the alliance declared themselves faithful to the thought of Franco he replied in public that Franco was the greatest ever enemy of Carlism and withdrew. In one of his last interviews he expressed anxiety about forthcoming partidocracia.\n\nIn the post-war Spain Tejada gained prominence principally as a theorist of law; present day scholars either suggest that Francoist setting provided a favorable background for domination of iusnaturalismo against other schools, or bluntly claim that Neoescolástica was the regime’s means of auto-legitimization, enforced and disguised as \"pluralism\". His writings on history of political thought were appreciated if could have been presented as picturing the regime as ultimate climax of Hispanic tradition, while Traditionalist theory of politics – acceptable in the 1950s – when assuming a decisively Carlist flavor was clearly unwelcome in the 1970s.\n\nDuring and after the Second Restoration Tejada's opus went dramatically out of fashion; already by the end of his life he was invoked in the press as a ridiculous fanatic who did not even merit a response, while later – among occasional courteous references – he was venomously denounced as \"distinguida personalidad del franquismo\". In 1986 Gabriella Pèrcopo co-founded Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada, which pays tribute to his thought by promoting Hispanic studies. Two institutions he set up, Centro Zumalacárregui and Asociación \"Felipe II\", are active until today, organizing conferences and issuing own publications; some of these initiatives are supported financially by Ministry of Education and . RACMYP holds also a massive Tejada's library.\n\nAlready in 1977 Tejada lamented that Spanish universities were becoming mimetic replicas of the European ones; some claim that indeed, in the 1980s and 1990s Traditionalism as scientific school was almost entirely eradicated from Spanish academic realm, though they also point to a number of active scholars who might be considered either Tejada's disciples or heavily influenced by his thought. Beyond the Hispanic and Lusitanian realm it hardly made an impact, though there are exceptions. Bibliography on Elías is nearing a hundred titles. The key one is a monograph by (1994); apart from three other volumes, the remaining titles are articles fathered mostly by his followers and published in specialized reviews. The 2008 anniversary of Tejada's death produced a few memorial articles ranging from Chile to Poland.\n\nGeneral assessment of Tejada's scholarly standing seems far from agreed. Some point to his massive production and suggest that having been among greatest intellectuals of his time he led a school of his own, building a holistic \"sistema tejadiano\" or \"pensamiento tejadiano\". Others consider him either mostly a law theorist or mostly a student of Hispanidad. His followers point also to his charming personality and acknowledging massive erudition, call him a genius monster. Others suggest that he was a little-minded, vindictive, impossible to deal with bigot of an overgrown ego, his career enabled by anti-democratic nature of the Francoist regime, dubbed \"reaccionario\" and the passion of his life, \"tradición española\", referred to as \"ni es tradición ni es española\". In the compromise version, he is either presented as notable but second-rate representative of Traditionalism or as an erudite eminent for some of his case studies.\n\n\n"}

Between them, they played 231 Test matches, taking 853 wickets. They were one of the most deadly combinations in world cricket, especially on the dusty subcontinental pitches.\n\nThe spin quartet was instrumental in producing many Indian Test victories. There was only one match in which all four of them were in the starting XI: usually one of the off spinners, Prasanna or Venkataraghavan, was left out. However, these four men made important contributions to some of India's greatest triumphs, including Test series victories in the West Indies and England, as well as Test victories in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2004, the Board of Control for Cricket in India conferred on them the CK Nayudu award, named after India's first Test captain.\n\nBy the 1966-67 season, the interest in cricket in India had risen to unprecedented levels. Despite being beaten by the West Indies at home, the Indian team's spirits were not dampened. The captain Nawab of Pataudi thought that it would be a good idea to introduce more quality spinners into the team in order to compensate for the absence of good new-ball bowlers in the country. Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, the leg spinner, had already established his place in the team with solid performances against Australia and the West Indies. Erapalli Prasanna was making him comeback having been out of the team for five years, while both Venkatarghavan and Bedi played in the series against West Indies. All four of them played their first (and only game together) against England at Birmingham in the summer of 1967. Prasanna and Chandrasekhar impressed in that game, claiming 7 and 6 wickets respectively, and all four bowlers bowled a tight line. Even though these four bowlers continued to play for 11 more years, this remained the only Test where all of them featured in the Indian test XI.\n\nOver the years, the spin quartet played vital roles in several memorable victories for the Indian team, starting with an overseas series win against New Zealand in 1967-68. Some of the major Test successes spin quartet were a part, are as follows\nOut of the four, only Venkataraghavan and Bedi played regular one-day cricket for India. Prasanna never played ODIs, and Chandrasekhar played just one game, against New Zealand in 1976. Bedi and Venkatarghavan played in 10 ODIs together, which included the World Cups of 1975 and 1979.\n\nThe spin quartet played a combined 231 Tests for India from 1962 to 1983, and grabbed 853 wickets, with 43 five-wicket inning hauls. Much of this success can be attributed to the different bowling styles these bowlers possessed. Bedi was an orthodox left arm-spinner, while Chandrasekhar an attacking leg-break bowler whereas Prasanna and Venkataraghavan were both off-spinners. This way, they could target all kinds of batsmen in the opposition and give their captains plenty of options. It was Chandrasekhar and Bedi who were the leaders of the attack. The two played 42 Tests alongside each other and had almost similar figures, of 184 wickets each. Bedi averaged 27.22, while Chandra averaged 28.70 in these games.\n\n"}

He was \"often a critic of the conventional wisdom.\" He was remembered by climate scientists as \"a giant\" who \"was brilliant at articulating the connections among technology, economics, culture, policy and politics.\"\n\nSchipper attended the University of California at Berkeley. He earned Bachelor's degrees in Physics and Music in 1968, and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics.\n\nSchipper worked at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) for more than 20 years. In addition, he worked at the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley, Shell International in London, as well as being Fulbright Scholar at the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics in Stockholm. He was a guest researcher at the World Bank, VVS Tekniska Foereningen, the OECD, and the Stockholm Environment Institute. He worked closely with the Global Business Network and Cambridge Energy Research Associates.\n\nHe served on the editorial boards of five major journals and was a member of the Swedish Board for Transportation and Communications Research. For four years he was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Science’s Transportation Research Board’s Committee on Sustainable Transport and Committee on Developing Countries. \n\nAt the time of his death, Schipper was a senior research scientist at both University of California Berkeley’s Global Metropolitan Studies and at the Precourt Institute of Energy Efficiency at Stanford University conducting research and policy analysis on efficient energy use in transportation systems. \n\nSchipper's first seminal contribution came in 1976, when he published an influential paper in \"Science\" pointing out that Sweden consumed far less energy per unit of economic activity than the United States did. His work on the energy efficiency of Swedish housing culminated in his 1985 book \"Coming in from the Cold\" with Stephen Meyers and Henry Kelly. Schipper testified before Congress on this subject in March 1984.\n\nSchipper shifted his primary attention to transport in the 1980s and started the Berkeley Lab’s International Energy Studies group with Jayant Sathaye, and the two co-led the group for many years. \n\nHe was co-founder of EMBARQ, the World Resources Institute Center for Sustainable Transport, and remained as a senior associate emeritus. \n\nFrom 1995 to 2001, he was a senior scientist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. \n\nHe contributed to the Second and Third Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He was due to act as Review Editor for the chapter on Transport in Working Group III's contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report, released in April 2014.\n\nJohn Holdren, later to become Science Advisor to President Barack Obama, was the first person to hire Schipper as an energy specialist, at Berkeley in the early 1970s. He said ‘‘Lee was one of the first people to point out that people don’t want to consume energy, but they want to consume energy services, like transportation, comfortable rooms, cold beer and so forth. And that there was an enormous variation in the amount of energy needed to perform those services.’’\n\nMark Levine, who was Schipper’s superviser for most his career at LBNL, said: \"Lee was the founding father of a school of energy analysts, a tradition carried on with vigor in the Energy Analysis Department at LBNL... The work he did has been carried on here. He created an important tradition of understanding energy by studying it from the bottom up, which means by end user.\" Schipper broke new ground by analyzing energy data sector by sector and end-use by end-use in various countries and comparing them. He demonstrated that energy intensity did not correlate with GDP in any simple way and was able to show why. \n\nHe was described as being an irrepressible iconoclast with a wonderful knack of turning a phrase to excellent effect. Evidence for this was publishing 15 letters to the editor in the \"New York Times\" on energy efficiency. For example, in his view the \"cash for clunkers\" program—which offered rebates to people who bought a new car with better mileage than their old one—did little to save energy, although it may have reduced air pollution. In many cases, buyers used the rebate to buy something bigger and more high-powered than they would have otherwise. \"The effect is inverse of what we were hoping for\" he said.\n\nSchipper was also an accomplished musician. He was the leader of the University of California Jazz Quintet in 1968. As a UC Berkeley student and vibraphonist, he led his jazz group to victory at the Notre Dame Jazz Festival in 1967. In 1969 Danish saxophonist Carsten Meinert invited him to record on his album \"C.M. Musictrain\" in Denmark (Spectator Records). In 1973 he recorded \"The Phunky Physicist\" with Swedish guitar player Janne Schaffer. He would reprise the role as band leader with an ad hoc jazz group, Lee Schipper and the Mitigators, who performed primarily in conjunction with energy-related conferences.\n\nHe was also one of the world’s experts on Wilhelm Furtwangler, a 20th century symphonic and operatic conductor, and collected one of the most complete sets of his recordings.\n\n"}

{"id": "12551717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12551717", "title": "Niujie", "text": "Niujie\n\nNiujie ( \"Oxen Street\") is a neighborhood at Guang'anmen, in Xicheng District in southwest Beijing, China. The name \"Niujie\" can refer to the street \"Niujie\" or to the neighborhood \"Niujie\". The community was previously in Xuanwu District before the district was merged into Xicheng in 2010.\n\nThe Niujie district is administered by the Niujie Street Administrative Office. The core area of this district is along the street Niujie. The Niujie core area, a Hui people neighborhood, has Beijing's largest concentration of Muslim people. As of 2013 there is a Muslim-oriented hospital as well as social services, cafés, shops, restaurants, and schools catering to the Muslim population. In 2002 Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan, authors of \"Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing,\" wrote that Niujie \"continues to thrive as a major residential area of the Hui people in Beijing and as a prominent supplier of Hui foods and services for the entire city.\" The neighborhood has the Niujie Mosque, which according to Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan, \"mark[s] the\nidentity of Niujie\" and has an element of centrality in the community. Most larger Hui neighborhoods in Beijing have their own mosques.\n\nAt up to the Tang Dynasty, what is now Niujie would have been on the city's periphery according to archival research and historical documents. The Niujie Mosque was built between 916 and 1125. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated that the establishment of the Hui settlement \"probably\" was related to Muslims joining the army of Genghis Khan, who had conquered Beijing, and that based on some gravestones of imams encountered at the Niujie Mosque, a significant community of Hui people had lived in the Niujie area dating back to the Yuan Dynasty. During that dynasty many Muslims moved to Beijing. Therefore, soldiers were the first Hui people in Niujie.\n\nDuring the Yuan Dynasty Niujie was located in proximity to and outside of the main Beijing city wall, and it had the name Willow River Village. Dru C. Gladney, author of \"Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic\", wrote that according to stories from that Dynasty, Han people rarely walked in the neighborhood alone. In addition, the stories state that during the dynasty, 2,953 households resided on Niujie. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that \"peripheral location reflected separation between the Hui people living there and the Mongolian residents living within the city wall.\" In 1544 an outer city wall was established and Willow River Village was within this outer city wall. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that wrote that the community \"was still considered peripheral to the city proper where most Han Chinese lived.\"\n\nAccording to the China Internet Information Center, a legend stated that the street Niujie was originally named \"Pomegranate Street\" or Liujie () because the Muslims in the community grew pomegranate trees. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated the \"Liu\" meant \"willow\" (C: 柳, P: \"Liǔ\", W: \"Liu\") and that the similarity between \"liu\" and \"niu\" \"might have given rise to the name change.\" Gladney wrote that the name may have originated from a concentration of beef butchers during the Qing Dynasty or from the homophonic similarity to the Liu River, where pomegranate and willow trees grew. The name change of the community to Niujie occurred during the Qing Dynasty. The China Internet Information Center stated that the street name changed when members of the began specializing in beef. At that time, imams had butchered both mutton and beef.\n\nWenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan stated that the Niujie Hui community continued to be distinct from the Manchu community in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn the late 1990s the neighborhood underwent a renovation and the majority of the 3,000 families living there relocated on a temporary basis as the renovations occurred. Reza Hasmath, author of \"The Identification, Settlement, and Representation of Ethnic Minorities in Beijing,\" wrote that this \"perhaps\" was a reaction to the per capita GDP and economic growth rate of Xuanwu District trailing that of Dongcheng District and Xicheng District. The renovations of a area in the district began in 1997, 26,000 residents in about 7,500 households were affected by the renovations. The completion of the first phase occurred by the end of 2000. New apartment buildings had been constructed, and a government policy stated that displaced residents of Niujie only needed to pay a small price in order to move into the new buildings. At the end of phase one, 3,000 people moved into the new apartment buildings. The majority of residents who decided not to return were Han Chinese. Overall the non-Muslims had a tendency to remain out of the neighborhood. Almost all of the Muslim families returned after renovations ended. Overall 90% of the displaced families from the first phase of the renovation had returned.\n\nIn 2002, Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that Niujie \"continues to be a thriving enclave, with a high concentration of Hui residents and economic activities\". The second stage of the renovation was scheduled to be completed that year.\n\nNiujie district had 64,059 residents, 21.9% of them being Hui, in 2000. As of 2000 24,088 people lived in the Niujie core area, 54.1% being Hui. This gives it a higher percentage of Hui population than other areas of the district. The core area is one of Beijing's largest ethnic enclaves Reza Hasmath, author of \"A Comparative Study of Minority Development in China and Canada\", wrote that since the ethnic attractions of many areas in Beijing are not located in areas that have strong minority demographics, the fact that Niujie still is strongly Hui is \"more remarkable\".\n\nAs of 1996 the district had 55,722 residents, with 13,755, or 24.7% of the total population, being ethnic minorities. Of the minorities, 13,307, or 96.6%, were Hui. In the core area itself, there were 2,446 residents and 649 households resident. Of the individuals, 1,763 were Hui, making up 70.2% of the population. Of the households 475 were Hui, making up 69.3%, and the Manchu and Mongolian ethnic groups each had two households.\n\nIn the neighborhoods on both sides of the core area, as of 1996 about 50% of the residents were Han and 50% were Hui. In the Tang Fang neighborhood in the Niujie District, as of the 1982 Census, there were 3,107 individuals. Of them, there were 1,814 Hui, making up 58.38% of the population, 1,272 Han, making up 40.94% of the population, and 21 Manchu, making up .68% of the population. As of 1996 the communities closer to the core area have higher Hui populations than those further from the core area.\n\nAs of 2007, according to Nimrod Baranovich, author of \"Inverted Exile: Uyghur Writers and Artists in Beijing and the Political Implications of Their Work,\" he had been informed that many Uyghur people live in Niujie.\n\nAs of 2011 the Niujie core area features various buildings decorated in an Islamic Chinese style, including the post office and apartment blocks. The apartments were painted in the Islamic-associated colors white and green and decorated with Islamic symbols. The core area includes a Hui primary school, a supermarket carrying halal products, and several Muslim restaurants. As of 1996 there were There were 51 Islamic meatshops, 51 Islamic restaurants, and several Islamic foodstuff stores in all of Xuanwu district. On Niujie Street at that time there were Hui \"getihu\" who sold fruit and pastries, 8 Islamic noodle and pastry shops, and 2 small Islamic restaurants.\n\nThe Chinese Islamic Association building, located southeast of the Mosque, has Arab architectural flourishes such as parapets and large green domes. It was built in the 1950s. The \"Huimin Yiyuan\" (S: 回民医院, P: \"Huímín Yīyuàn\"), the Hui hospital, is at the south end of the Niujie street. The Communist Party of China (CPC) has erected various signs stating that the local government had helped improve the delivery of electricity, gas, and water to Niujie discussing the historic achievements of the Niujie community.\n\nThe Tang Fang neighborhood is west of Niujie Street on Beiruilu.\n\nThe Niujie Street Administrative Office governs the area in the community. In 2002 Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan concluded that based on the re-development plans stating that the Niujie Mosque would remain in its current location with its \"centrality\" in the community, the administrative office \"has played an important role in preserving the Hui character of the enclave, making it possible for the Hui residents to return and live in a setting they are highly identified with, despite urban renovation and redevelopment.\"\n\nWenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan explained that the economy of the community is focused on \"ethnic-specific activities\" such as Jade processing, meat trading, and Islamic restaurants. Tourism, including visits to the Niujie Mosque, is a part of the economy of Niujie. A survey conducted by Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan in January 2002 concluded that the market and shops on Nanhengxi Street sold about of beef and mutton daily. The same survey counted over 30 Islamic restaurants on Nanhengxi Street. In addition, around 2002, there had been an increase in contractors, miscellaneous repair shops, and other services.\n\nReza Hasmath wrote that Niujie was \"one of the last surviving, important ethnic enclaves in Beijing\" because the rapid growth of Beijing had caused many ethnic enclaves to vanish. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that Niujie has remained to be an ethnic enclave because it continued to be \"peripheral to the city’s core area of economic growth\" with much of the expansion occurring in north Beijing instead of the portion of Beijing where Niujie resides. In an interview in August 2000 the head of a resident committee in the Madian neighborhood in Haidian District, which historically was a Hui community but faced a decline due to development, stated that even though going to Niujie from Madian meant a lengthy commute, many Madian Hui now preferred to travel there to purchase beef and mutton. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that \"This is evidence that Niujie’s role as a large enclave and major supplier for the Hui people in Beijing has been enhanced as the ethnic economy of Madian gradually declined.\"\n\nWenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that Niujie served in a wider ethnic Hui economy across Beijing as well as providing a local ethnic enclave economy in the period from the Ming Dynasty until 1949. In the pre-1949 period 75% of the jade trade enterprises in the city were located in Niujie. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that in this period a central component of Niujie was the food service sector, which consisted of beef and button stands, Hui food wagons and stands, and Hui restaurants. They stated that residents of Niujie \"gained a reputation for operating meat delicatessens in other parts of Beijing.\" Niujie was also adjacent to a major vegetable market, \"Caishikou\".\n\nOne school in Niujie, the Beijing Xuanwu Huimin Elementary School (S: 北京市宣武回民小学, P: \"Běijīng Shì Xuānwǔ Huímín Xiǎoxué\", \"Beijing Xuanwu Hui People Elementary School\"), serves the Hui people living in the area.\n\nBy 2011 a principal of a Hui school in Niujie had stated that the students are taught in the Chinese educational scheme and are given a supplementary Islamic education, but that \"our first priority is to ensure that the Teaching Scheme is taught, as it is the case for all students in Beijing, so our students are not left behind.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The character was then recast with David Tom on March 11, 2004 In August 2004, the role was temporarily played by Shane McRae.\n\nPaul crossed over to ABC's \"All My Children\" multiple times from December 30, 2003, to October 27, 2004, during a \"baby switch\" storyline involving both series. The character of Paul was killed off as part of a murder mystery storyline in October 2004, but lingered in newly created flashbacks and other characters' dreams and hallucinations until May 2005.\n\nTom is the real-life brother of Heather Tom, who played Paul's half-sister Kelly Cramer.\n\nPaul Cramer first appears in Llanview in late 2003 at the re-opening Crossroads, the bar formerly owned by Ben Davidson. In search of Sarah Roberts, the daughter of Tina Lord and Cord Roberts, Paul says he had known Sarah's brother C.J. while serving as a pilot in the Navy and that he had made \"the biggest mistake of his life.\" The nature of this mistake is never revealed as Paul never shares any scenes with Sarah and instead becomes embroiled in a storyline with Dorian Lord and the Cramer family.\n\nA local society maven, Dorian is shocked as Paul arrives on her doorstep and claims to be the son of Dorian's mentally disturbed younger sister Melinda (who had recently confessed to Dorian that she had given birth to another child during her years in Europe) and therefore Kelly's brother. Paul was raised by an upstanding foster family and has only just recently learned of his true heritage. Dorian soon worries that this heretofore unknown Cramer could be the heir to her aging Aunt Betsy's fortune. Aunt Betsy, an eccentric old spinster, has very specific ideas on what a \"real Cramer\" should be and feels that almost all the women in the family have abdicated their power and self-esteem to men.

He is a research professor in the Department of Physics at the California Institute of Technology. He has been a contributor to the physics blog Cosmic Variance, and has published in scientific journals such as \"Nature\" as well as other publications, including \"The New York Times\", \"Sky & Telescope\", and \"New Scientist\".\n\nHe has appeared on the History Channel's \"The Universe\", Science Channel's \"Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman\", \"Closer to Truth\" (broadcast on PBS), and Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report\". Carroll is the author of \"Spacetime And Geometry\", a graduate-level textbook in general relativity, and has also recorded lectures for The Great Courses on cosmology, the physics of time, and the Higgs boson. He is also the author of three popular books: one on the arrow of time entitled \"From Eternity to Here\", one on the Higgs boson entitled \"The Particle at the End of the Universe\", and one on science and philosophy entitled \"The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself\". He began a podcast in 2018 called \"Mindscape,\" in which he interviews other experts and intellectuals on a variety of science-related topics.\n\nCarroll received his PhD in astronomy and astrophysics in 1993 from Harvard University, where his advisor was George B. Field. His dissertation's title is \"Cosmological Consequences of Topological and Geometric Phenomena in Field Theories\". He worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago until 2006 when he was denied tenure. He is now a research professor at Caltech.\n\nHis most-cited work, \"Is Cosmic Speed-Up Due To New Gravitational Physics?\" was written with Vikram Duvvuri, Mark Trodden, and Michael Turner. With over 1,900 citations, it helped pioneer the study of f(R) gravity in cosmology.\n\nIn 2010, Carroll was elected as a fellow of the American Physical Society, for \"contributions to a wide variety of subjects in cosmology, relativity, and quantum field theory, especially ideas for cosmic acceleration, as well as contributions to undergraduate, graduate, and public science education\". In 2014 he was awarded the Andrew Gemant Award, a prize given by the American Institute of Physics for \"significant contributions to the cultural, artistic or humanistic dimension of physics.\" In 2015 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\nCarroll is married to Jennifer Ouellette, a science writer and the former director of the Science & Entertainment Exchange.\n\nCarroll has worked on a number of areas of theoretical cosmology, field theory and gravitation theory. His research papers include models of, and experimental constraints on, violations of Lorentz invariance; the appearance of closed timelike curves in general relativity; varieties of topological defects in field theory; and cosmological dynamics of extra spacetime dimensions. In recent years he has written extensively on models of dark energy and its interactions with ordinary matter and dark matter, as well as modifications of general relativity in cosmology.\n\nCarroll has also worked on the arrow of time problem. He and Jennifer Chen posit that the Big Bang is not a unique occurrence as a result of all of the matter and energy in the universe originating in a singularity at the beginning of time, but rather one of many cosmic inflation events resulting from quantum fluctuations of vacuum energy in a cold de Sitter space. They claim that the universe is infinitely old, but never reaches thermodynamic equilibrium as entropy increases continuously without limit due to the decreasing matter and energy density attributable to recurrent cosmic inflation. They assert that the universe is \"statistically time-symmetric\" insofar as it contains equal progressions of time \"both forward and backward\". Some of his work has been on violations of fundamental symmetries, the physics of dark energy, modifications of general relativity, and the arrow of time. Recently he started focusing on issues at the foundations of cosmology, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and complexity.\n\nCarroll, while raised as an Episcopalian, is an atheist, or as he calls it, a \"poetic naturalist\". He turned down an invitation to speak at a conference sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation, because he did not want to appear to be supporting a reconciliation between science and religion; however he later took part in a discussion with Buddhist scholar B. Alan Wallace organized by an institution sponsored by the same foundation. In 2004, he and Shadi Bartsch taught an undergraduate course title at the University of Chicago on the history of atheism. In 2012 he organized the workshop \"Moving Naturalism Forward\", which brought together scientists and philosophers to discuss issues associated with a naturalistic worldview. His article \"Does the Universe Need God?\" in \"The Blackwell Companion to Science and Christianity\" develops the claim that science no longer needs to posit a divine being to explain the existence of the universe. The article generated significant attention when it was discussed on \"The Huffington Post\". His 2016 book \" \"develops the philosophy of poetic naturalism.\n\nCarroll occasionally takes part in formal debates or discussions with theists. In 2012, he teamed up with Michael Shermer to debate with Ian Hutchinson of MIT and author Dinesh D'Souza at Caltech in an event titled \"The Great Debate: Has Science Refuted Religion?\" In 2014, Carroll debated with philosopher and Christian apologist William Lane Craig as part of the Greer-Heard Forum in New Orleans. The topic of debate was \"The Existence of God in Light of Contemporary Cosmology.\" Carroll received an \"Emperor Has No Clothes\" award at the Freedom From Religion Foundation Annual National Convention in October 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "217686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217686", "title": "Tommy Morrison", "text": "Tommy Morrison\n\nTommy David Morrison (January 2, 1969 – September 1, 2013) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 1996, and held the WBO heavyweight title in 1993. He retired from boxing in 1996 when he tested positive for HIV, but returned for two more fights in 2007 and 2008. Morrison is also known for his acting role when he starred alongside Sylvester Stallone in the 1990 film \"Rocky V\".\n\nMorrison had previously attempted a comeback to boxing in 2006, claiming he had tested negative for HIV. In August 2013, Morrison's mother announced that her son was in the final stages of AIDS, and he died on September 1, 2013.\n\nMorrison was born in Gravette, Arkansas. His mother, Diana, was of Native American descent, while his father's side was of majority Scottish descent. Morrison was raised in Delaware County, Oklahoma, spending most of his teenage years in Jay. Morrison's nickname, \"The Duke\", is based on the claim that he was related to Hollywood star John Wayne (né Marion Morrison). Morrison's older brother Tim Jr boxed and his father urged him to take up the sport at the age of ten. At the age of 13, Morrison claimed he used a fake ID and entered fifteen \"toughman\" contests (the minimum age for contestants was 21). He later told \"The New York Times\" that he lost only one of these matches.\n\nIn 1988, Morrison won the Regional Heavyweight Title – Kansas City Golden Gloves from Donald Ellis and advanced to the National Golden Gloves in Omaha, Nebraska, where he lost a split decision to Derek Isaman. Two weeks later, Morrison took part in the Western Olympic trials in Houston, Texas winning the Heavyweight Title and garnering the \"Most Outstanding Fighter\" of the tournament. Two weeks after that at the Olympic Trials in Concord, California, Morrison lost a split decision to Ray Mercer, who later won the gold medal at the Seoul Olympics. His combined professional and amateur record is 343–24–1, with 315 wins by knockout.\n\nMorrison started his professional boxing career on November 10, 1988, with a first-round knockout of William Muhammad in New York City. Three weeks later, he scored another first-round knockout. In 1989, Morrison had 19 wins and no losses, 15 by knockout. In 1989, actor Sylvester Stallone observed one of Morrison's bouts. Stallone arranged a script reading and cast Morrison in the movie \"Rocky V\" as Tommy \"The Machine\" Gunn, a young and talented protege of the retired Rocky Balboa. He took a six-month break from boxing to work on the movie in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Morrison won fights against opponents James Tillis and former world champion Pinklon Thomas. He was given an opportunity to face fellow undefeated fighter Ray Mercer, the WBO title holder in a Pay Per View card held on October 18, 1991. Morrison suffered the first loss of his career, losing by 5th-round knockout.\n\nHe had six wins in 1992, including fights with Art Tucker and Joe Hipp, who later became the first Native American to challenge for the world heavyweight title. In the Hipp fight, held June 19, 1992, Morrison was suffering from what was later discovered to be a broken hand and broken jaw, but rallied to score a knockout in the ninth round. After two wins in 1993, including one over two-time world title challenger Carl \"The Truth\" Williams, Morrison found himself fighting for the WBO title again, against heavyweight boxing legend George Foreman, who was himself making a comeback.\n\nMorrison chose to avoid brawling with Foreman and spent the fight boxing from long range. He was able to hit and move effectively in this manner, and after a closely contested bout he won a unanimous 12-round decision and the WBO title.\n\nMorrison's first title defense was scheduled against Mike Williams, but when Williams withdrew on the night of the fight, Tim Tomashek stood in as a replacement. Although Tomashek had been prepared to fight as a backup plan, some news reports created the impression that he had just been pulled out of the crowd. The WBO later rescinded their sanctioning of this fight due to Tomashek's lack of experience. Almost immediately, talks of a fight with WBC champion Lennox Lewis began, but were halted when virtually unknown Michael Bentt upset Morrison in his next bout. Bentt knocked Morrison down three times, and the fight was stopped in the first round in front of a live HBO Boxing audience. Morrison recovered by winning three bouts in a row in 1994, but his last fight of the year, against Ross Puritty, ended with a draw.\n\nMorrison won three fights in 1995 before meeting former #1 contender Razor Ruddock. Ruddock dropped Morrison to his knees in the first round, but Morrison recovered to force a standing count in round two and compete on even terms for five rounds. In the sixth round, Ruddock hurt Morrison with a quick combination, but just as it seemed Morrison was in trouble, he countered with a tremendous hook that put Ruddock on the canvas. Ruddock regained his feet, but Morrison drove him to the ropes and showered him with an extended flurry of blows. Just as the bell was about to sound, the referee stepped in and declared Morrison the winner by TKO.\n\nThe much-anticipated fight with Lewis, who had also lost his world championship, finally took place following the Ruddock match. Morrison was knocked out in the sixth round.\n\nAt one point in 1996 Morrison was married to two women at the same time, Dawn Freeman and Dawn Gilbert. Morrison had two children by age 19. Tommy and Trisha Morrison were married in 2011. They had no children. He has two sons who are also professional boxers, Trey Lippe Morrison and James McKenzie Morrison.\n\nIn 1996, Morrison was scheduled to fight against Arthur Weathers. The Nevada Athletic Commission determined that Morrison had tested positive for HIV. The Commission suspended Morrison from boxing in Nevada. Several days later, Morrison's physician administered a test, which was also positive. At a news conference on February 15, 1996, Morrison said he had contracted HIV because of a \"permissive, fast and reckless lifestyle\". Morrison stated that he would \"absolutely\" never fight again.\n\nAt another news conference on September 19, 1996, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Morrison announced he wished to fight \"one last time\" when he could find an opponent, the proceeds of which would benefit his KnockOut AIDS Foundation. A spokesman for the Oklahoma Professional Boxing Advisory Board said Morrison would probably not be permitted to fight in Oklahoma because of his Nevada suspension. To treat his infection, Morrison said he took antiretroviral medication, which reduced his viral load to almost undetectable levels.\n\nIn 2006, Morrison said his HIV tests had been false positives. The Nevada commission's medical advisory board reviewed Morrison's 1996 test results and concluded they were \"ironclad and unequivocal.\" Morrison said he tried to get a copy of the original test result but was unable to do so, adding: \"I don't think it ever existed.\" The Commission said Morrison could \"contact the laboratory, and they would immediately release the results to him.\"\nMorrison tested negative for HIV four times in January 2007. That year, he began fighting again. After passing medical tests in Texas, West Virginia licensed Morrison to fight in that state. In February 2007 he fought and beat John Castle. In June, Morrison's former agent, Randy Lang, alleged that Morrison had tested positive in January and that the boxer had tampered with blood samples. Morrison responded that he had fired Lang when he discovered that Lang was not a lawyer.\n\nOn July 22, 2007, the \"New York Times\" reported that Morrison took two HIV tests in 2007 and a third specifically for the \"Times\". HIV experts reviewed the three tests and concluded that the 1996 result had been a false positive. But ringside doctors, including Nevada's chief ringside physician, expressed doubt. They implied that the negative results were not in fact based on Morrison's blood. The experts agreed that no one is ever cured of HIV; if the negative tests from 2007 were performed on Morrison's blood, then he had never been infected with HIV.\n\nThe \"Kansas City Star\" described his early 2009 fight in Wyoming as a \"staged\" event and a \"fake fight.\" In January 2011, the RACJ, the boxing commission for the province of Quebec, required that Morrison take a supervised HIV test in advance of a scheduled 2011 fight. Morrison declined to take the test because he said it would be the same kind of test administered by Nevada in 1996. Instead, Morrison invited the Quebec commission to attend a public test, but the commission did not come. Morrison stated that if Quebec refused to license him, he would \"take the dog and pony show somewhere else.\"\n\nIn December 1993, Morrison was charged with assault and public intoxication when he allegedly punched a University of Iowa student. Morrison said that the student had been staring at him. Morrison pleaded guilty and paid a $310 fine, but said he was innocent. In October 1996, Morrison pleaded guilty to transporting a loaded firearm in Jay, Oklahoma; he received a 6-month suspended sentence and a $100 fine. In 1997, an Oklahoma jury convicted him of DUI in an accident that left three people injured; the court ordered Morrison to spend time in treatment.\n\nIn September 1999, an Oklahoma court gave a two-year suspended sentence for a DUI elevated to felony level by his previous DUI conviction. On September 16, 1999, the police stopped Morrison for driving erratically and found drugs and weapons in his car, which resulted in various drugs and firearms charges. While awaiting trial on the September 16 charges, Morrison was again arrested on charges of intoxication and possessing a weapon while a felon in November 1999. On January 14, 2000, Morrison was sentenced to two years in prison on the September 16 charges. On April 3, 2002, he was sentenced to another year in prison after violating parole in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but was given credit for time previously served.\n\nIn August 2013, Elizabeth Merrill of ESPN.com reported that Morrison's mother Diana disclosed that Tommy had \"full-blown AIDS\" and was \"in his final days.\" She also stated that Morrison had been bedridden for over a year. The same article also stated that Morrison's wife, Trisha, did not believe Morrison had AIDS.\n\nOn September 1, 2013, Morrison died at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska at the age of 44. According to the Nebraska Department of Health & Human Services, Morrison's cause of death was cardiac arrest, resulting from multiorgan failure due to septic shock caused by a \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" infection.\n\n"}

At Calvet he worked under the chemical engineer Jean Ribéreau-Gayon, and they developed methods of analysing the wines that were to be purchased. In 1946, Peynaud completed his Doctorate at the University of Bordeaux and joined its faculty as a lecturer. Ribéreau-Gayon at this time was also teaching at the University, and the two shifted their previous focus of problems faced by Calvet to the problems faced by the winemakers themselves.\n\nWhile at the University of Bordeaux, where he became a professor of oenology, Peynaud worked at providing scientific explanations for many problems encountered in the process of winemaking. He convinced the wineries to begin picking of grapes at vineyards up to two weeks later than usual, and to complete the picking as quickly as possible. The practice of also picking underripe or rotten grapes was abandoned, so that the selected fruit arriving at the winery was of the best possible quality.\n\nPeynaud introduced crushing and fermenting fruit in separate batches based on vine age, vineyard location, or any other factor that resulted in fruit of differing qualities in order to control tannin extraction. He then applied the cool fermentations used in Champagne to still white Bordeaux in order to control fermentation temperatures.\n\nProposing methods that ran counter to many traditions, in the 1950s and 1960s skeptics would use the term \"Peynaudization\" of Bordeaux, but as his advice usually produced superior wines, criticism came to an end.\n\nPeynaud considered the control of malolactic fermentation to be one of his most important contributions to winemaking. It was commonly believed that malolactic fermentation was a sickness. He helped the wineries realize that they needed to encourage and control malolactic fermentation. He also stated, \"Using only the very best grapes is a new phenomenon,\" considering this \"the crowning achievement of [his] work.\"\n\nPeynaud was the \"Decanter\" Man of the Year in 1990. Michel Rolland is one of his pupils.\n\n\n"}
