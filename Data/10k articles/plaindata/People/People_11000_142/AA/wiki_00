She was a prominent Polish songwriter, having authored the lyrics to more than 2000 songs, and is considered an icon of Polish culture.\n\nOsiecka was born in Warsaw, the only child of Wiktor Osiecki, a Serbian-born pianist and composer, and a scholar Maria Sztechman of Serbian-Vlach descent. She spent her early years in Zakopane where her father played the piano at the Watra Restaurant. After World War II the Osiecki family moved to Warsaw and settled in the Saska Kępa borough. The small flat soon became Osiecka’s favourite place to work. She lived there almost her entire life. After her death, the \"Okularnicy\" Foundation placed a commemorative plaque on the building.\n\nAgnieszka was exceptionally gifted. She completed her coursework much more quickly than other students and graduated from Marie Curie-Skłodowska High School in 1952. She trained as a swimmer at Legia Sports Club and studied journalism at the University of Warsaw (1957–61) and film-directing at the prestigious National Film School in Łódź (1957–61) but dropped film-directing and started writing. Osiecka published essays and articles in the student press during her university years. She joined the famous Student Satirical Theatre (STS) in 1954 and wrote 166 political and lyrical songs for this company. She used to say \"I am a journalist, that is why some of my songs are reports which rhyme.\" She served on the artistic board of the STS Theatre until it closed in 1972.\n\n1962 marked her debut on Polish National Radio. Renown Polish actress Kalina Jędrusik sang Osiecka's lyrics to a hit song by Franciszka Leszczyńska called \"My First Ball\" (\"Mój pierwszy bal\"). One year later at the first National Festival of Polish Song in Opole in 1963 Agnieszka achieved a major success winning the main prize and six other prizes for her lyrics: \"Piosenka o Okularnikach“ (music by Jarosław Abram), as well as \"Białe małżeństwo,“ \"Czerwony kapturek,“ \"Kochankowie z ulicy Kamiennej,“ \"Solo na kontrabasie“ and \"Ulice wielkich miast.“\n\nShe was now recognised as a prominent young poet and the Polish National Radio offered her a job to create and lead a team to broadcast \"The Radio Song Studio\". She also worked on theatre and television productions. Together with composer Adam Sławiński she wrote a series called \"Listy śpiewające“ (\"Singing Letters“). Her first major theatre show \"Niech no tylko zakwitną jabłonie“ (\"Let the Apple-trees Bloom\") was staged at the Ateneum Theatre.\n\nHer lyrics were set to music by such composers as Krzysztof Komeda, Seweryn Krajewski, Adam Sławiński, Zygmunt Konieczny, and others.\n\nOsiecka and her partner, the famous journalist Daniel Passent, had their only child, a daughter, Agata, in 1973.\n\nThe Masurian Lake District was among Osiecka's favorite places in Poland. She liked to vacation there in the 1960s/70s with Polish intellectuals and artists. As a student she worked there for one of the local newspapers and in the autumn of her life she wrote for the Atelier Theatre in Sopot. She was a frequent visitor to the Halama writers' retreat house in Zakopane, in the Tatra Mountains.\n\nAgnieszka Osiecka published numerous books and released many records (see the full list at www.okularnicy.org.pl). She is considered one of the most important, prolific and gifted persons in postwar Polish culture and history. Osiecka died on 7 March 1997 after a battle of several years with colon cancer. She is buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.\n\nThe Agnieszka Osiecka Okularnicy Foundation was founded by her daughter shortly after the poet's death. The Okularnicy Foundation promotes Osiecka’s work, runs the Poet's Archive, organizes the annual singing competition \"Let us Remember Agnieszka Osiecka“, manages the Internet archive and publishes books.\n\nTo honour her creative output and her work at the National Polish Radio, the Music Studio was named after Osiecka in 1997.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30733371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30733371", "title": "Anglicisation of names", "text": "Anglicisation of names\n\nThe anglicisation of personal names is the change of non-English-language personal names to spellings nearer English sounds, or substitution of equivalent or similar English personal names in the place of non-English personal names.\n\nA small number of figures, mainly very well-known classical and religious writers, appear under English names—or more typically under Latin names, in English texts. This practice became prevalent as early as in English-language translations of the New Testament, where translators typically renamed figures such as Yeshu and Simon bar-Jonah as Jesus and Peter, and treated most of the other figures in the New Testament similarly. (In contrast, translations of the Old Testament traditionally use the original names, more or less faithfully transliterated from the original Hebrew.) Transatlantic explorers such as Zuan Caboto and Cristoforo Colombo became popularly known as John Cabot and Christopher Columbus; English-speakers anglicized and Latinized the name of the Polish astronomer Mikołaj Kopernik to (Nicholas) Copernicus, and the English-speaking world typically knows the French-born theologian Jean Calvin as John Calvin. Such Anglicizations became less usual after the sixteenth century.\n\nMost Gaelic language surnames of Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man have been anglicised at some time. The Gaels were among the first Europeans to adopt surnames during the Dark Ages. Originally, most Gaelic surnames were composed of the given name of a child's father, preceded by Mac (\"son\") or Nic (or \"Ní\", both being variants of \"nighean\", meaning \"daughter\") depending on the sex. These surnames would not be passed down another generation, and a woman would keep her birth surname after marriage. The same was originally true of Germanic surnames which followed the pattern [father's given name]+son/daughter (this is still the case in Iceland, as exemplified by the singer Björk Guðmundsdóttir and former Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson).\n\nOver the centuries, under the influence of post-Medieval English practice, this type of surname has become static over generations, handed down the male lineage to all successive generations so that it is no longer indicates the given name of a holder's father any more than the suffix -son on a Germanic language surname does today. Among English-speaking peoples of Gaelic heritage, the use of \"Nic\" as a prefix for daughters has been replaced by \"Mac\", regardless of sex (as per Geraldine McGowan, Alyth McCormack, and Sarah McLachlan). Wives also began to take on the surnames of their husbands.\n\nAnother common pattern of surname was similar to that preceded by Mac/Nic, but instead was preceded by Ó or Ui, signifying a grandchild or descendant. Not all Gaelic surnames signified relationship to a forebear, however. Some signified an ancestral people or homeland, such as \"MacDhubhghaill\" (son of a dark-haired foreigner; referring to one type of Scandinavian), \"MacFhionnghaill\" (son of a fair-haired foreigner; also referring to a Scandinavian people), MacLachlainn or MacLachlainneach (son of the Scandinavian). Others indicated the town or village of a family's origin, sometimes disguised as an ancestor's name as in Ó Creachmhaoil, which prefixes a toponym as though it was the name of a person. As with other culturo-linguistic groups, other types of surnames were often used as well, including trade-names such as \"MacGhobhainn\", \"Mac a'Ghobhainn\" or \"Mac Gabhainn\" (\"son of the smith\"), and physical characteristics such as hair colour.\n\nIn Anglicising Gaelic names, the prefixes \"Mac\", \"Nic\", and \"Ó\" were frequently removed (the name \"MacPhearais\", by example, was sometimes anglicised as \"Pierce\" or \"Piers\", identically to the given name; \"Ó Leannáin\" and \"Ó Lionáin\" have both been anglicised as \"Lennon\"; \"Ó Ceallaigh\" and \"Ó Cadhla\" have been anglicised as \"Kelly\"). Where they were retained, \"Mac\" was often rendered \"Mc\", \"M', \"or \"Mag-\" (the last is seen in renderings such as \"Maguire\" for \"Mac Uidhir\") and \"Ó/Ui\" became \"O\"'. \"MacGhobhainn\", \"Mac a'Ghobhainn\" and \"Mac Gabhainn\" (\"son of the smith\") were anglicised as \"McGowan\", \"Gowan\", \"McGavin\", and \"Gavin\". In surnames which had been prefixed \"Mac\", the final hard \"c\" sound remained when the \"Mac\" was removed. As Gaelic spelling rules required the first letter of a name preceded by Mac or Nic to be lenited (unless it was an l, n, or r) with the addition of an h after (silencing it, or changing its sound), and for the last vowel to be slender (i or e) if male, the Anglicised form of a Gaelic name could look quite different. By example, \"MacPhearais\" (\"Mac+Pearas\"=\"son of Pierce\") has been anglicised as \"Corish\", and \"MacInnis\" has been anglicised as \"Guinness\".\n\nGaelic names were also sometimes anglicised by translating the prefix \"Mac\" into the suffix \"son\", as per the Germanic practice. \"MacPhearais\", consequently, has been anglicised as \"Pearson\", and \"MacAoidh\" (Mac+Aodh) has been anglicised as \"Hewson\" (it is also anglicised as \"McHugh\" and \"Hughes\"). The Gaelic \"MacSheain\" or \"MacSheathain\" (son of Seán) has similarly been anglicised \"Johnson\" (it has also been less thoroughly anglicised as \"MacIain\" and \"MacIan\").\n\nThe other main changes made in Anglicisation from Gaelic are the removal of silent letters, and respelling according to English phonetics (as \"Ó Creachmhaoil\" or \"Creachmhaoil\" became \"Crockwell\", and \"MacDhubhghaill\" became \"Dougal\"). ( Ó Briain has often become O'Brien, Ó Rothláin became Rowland, Ó Néill became O'Neill and some surnames like Ó Súilleabháin may be shortened to just O'Sullivan or Sullivan. Similarly, native Scottish names were altered such as Somhairle to Sorley, Mac Gill-Eain to MacLean, and Mac Aoidh to Mackay. Many Welsh names have also been altered, such as 'ap Hywell' to Powell, or 'ap Siôn' to Jones.\n\nAnglicisation of non-English-language names was common for immigrants, or even visitors, to English speaking countries. An example is the German composer Johann Christian Bach, the \"London Bach,\" who was known as \"John Bach\" after emigrating to England.\n\nDuring the time in which there were large influxes of immigrants from Europe to the United States and United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, the given names and surnames of many immigrants were changed.\n\nTraditionally common Christian given names could be substituted: such as James for the etymologically connected Jacques. Alternatively phonetical similarities, such as Joe for Giò (Giovanni or Giorgio); or abbreviation, Harry for Harilaos.\n\nThe anglicisation of a personal name now usually depends on the preferences of the bearer. Name changes are less common today for Europeans emigrating to the United States than they are for people originating in, or descending from those who emigrated from, East Asian countries.\n\nFrench immigrants to the United States (both those of Huguenot and French-Canadian background) often accommodated those unfamiliar with French pronunciations and spellings by altering their surnames in either of two ways: spellings were changed to fit the traditional pronunciation (Pariseau became Parizo, Boucher became Bushey, Mailloux became Mayhew, Cartier became Carter, Carpentier became Carpenter), or pronunciations were changed to fit the spelling (Benoît, pronounced , became ). In some cases, it could go either way (Gagné, pronounced , become or Gonyea), or something only slightly similar (Bourassa became Bersaw).\n\nSome anglicized French-Canadian surnames:\n\n\nScandinavian surnames were often anglicized upon the immigrant's arrival into the United States.\n\n\nBesides simple abbreviation or anglicization of spelling, there are some conventional English versions of or nicknames for Greek names which were formerly widely used and are still encountered:\n\nHaving immigrated to Canada and United States in the late 19th – early 20th centuries many Ukrainians looked for English equivalents to their given names. In some cases, Canadian or American-born children received two names: the English one (for official purposes) and a Ukrainian one (for family or ethnic community use only).\n\n\nAnglicization of family surnames occurred frequently among American born children of German immigrants. With the American declaration of war on Germany, many German-American families anglicized their names due to the anti-German hysteria of the First World War.\n\n\n\nItalian surnames were often anglicised in the United States: for example, the i-ending of a number of Italian names becomes y, e, or ie.\n\n\nWhen Dutch immigrants arrived in the United States, often their names got changed. This was either done on purpose, to make the name easier to write and remember, or by accident because the clerk didn't know how to spell the name and wrote it down phonetically.\n\nCoastal Salish people were often given \"Boston Names\" by early European settlers. These English names often had similar sounds to original Lushootseed names. \n\nWhen Lushootseed names were integrated into English, they were often recorded and pronounced very differently. An example of this is Chief Seattle. The name Seattle is an Anglicisation of the modern Duwamish conventional spelling Si'ahl, equivalent to the modern Lushootseed spelling \"siʔaɫ\" . He is also known as Sealth, Seathle, Seathl, or See-ahth.\n\n\n"}

He and hundreds of others surrendered to the Mexican army at Goliad, Texas, only to be executed in the Goliad Massacre.\n\nBurr H. Duval was the son of William Pope Duval and Nancy Hynes. He was born in 1809 in Bardstown. William Pope Duval was the first and longest-serving (twelve years) Territorial Governor of Florida. Burr Duval's brother, John Crittenden Duval (1816–1897), who later became a writer, was captured with him at Goliad; however, his life was spared. Another brother, Thomas Howard DuVal (1813-1880), had a distinguished judicial career in Texas.\n\nHe attended St. Joseph's College in Bardstown.\n\nAfter forming the Kentucky Mustangs, the group traveled to Texas to fight for independence from Mexico. They arrived at Quintana, Texas, in December 1835. Duval and his company were put under the command of Colonel James Walker Fannin, with Duval given the rank of captain.\n\nThe Mustangs, along with the five other companies under Fannin's command, were in Goliad, Texas, on March 14, 1836, when they received orders from Commander-in-Chief of the Texas Army Sam Houston to retreat to Victoria, Texas. Fannin delayed the retreat from Presidio La Bahia in Goliad, waiting for reinforcements.\n\nOnce it was learned that the reinforcements had been defeated on their way to Goliad, Colonel Fannin ordered the retreat. Captain Duval and his men began to retreat with the regiment, however, by the time the order came, the Mexican army under the command of José de Urrea had completely surrounded the town of Goliad. Duval and all of the men under Fannin's command were forced to surrender to the Mexican army on March 19, 1836.\n\nA week following the surrender, Antonio López de Santa Anna ordered the execution of most of the captured men. Colonel Fannin, Burr Duval and almost 400 other men were executed on March 27 in what became known as the Goliad Massacre.\n\nDuval County, Texas, is named after him.\n\n"}

Commonly these are nativity scenes showing the birth of Jesus, with his mother Mary, and her husband Joseph.\n\nDepictions as a baby with the Virgin Mary, known as \"Madonna and Child\", are iconographical types in Eastern and Western traditions. Other scenes from his time as a baby, of his circumcision, presentation at the temple, the adoration of the Magi, and the flight into Egypt, are common. Scenes showing his developing years are more rare but not unknown.\nSaint Joseph, Anthony of Padua, and Saint Christopher are often depicted holding the Christ Child. The Christian mystics Saint Teresa of Avila, Saint Therese of Lisieux, along with the devotees of Divino Niño such as Mother Angelica and Father Giovanni Rizzo claim to have had apparitions of Jesus as a toddler.\n\nThe Christ Child was a popular subject in European wood sculpture beginning in the 1300s.\n\nThe popularity of the Christ child was well known in Spain under the title \"Montanesino\" after the santero sculptor Juan Martínez Montañés who began the trend. These icons of the Christ Child was often posed in the \"contrapposto\" style in which the positioning of the knees reflected in the opposite direction, similar to ancient depictions of the Roman Emperor.\n\nThe growth of images being made were quite popular among nobility, while some images were also used to colonize kingdoms such of Spain and Portugal. Colonial images of the Christ child also began to wear vestments, a pious practice developed by the santero culture in later colonial years, carrying the depiction of holding the \"globus cruciger\", a bird symbolizing a soul or the Holy Spirit or various paraphernalia related to its locality or region.\nThe symbolism of the Child Jesus in art reached its apex during the Renaissance: the Holy Family was a central theme in the works of Leonardo da Vinci and many other masters.\n\n\"Tàladh Chrìosda\" (Christ Child Lullaby) is a Scottish carol from Moidart, Scotland. The Catholic priest Father Ranald Rankin, wrote the lyrics for Midnight Mass around the year 1855. He originally wrote 29 verses in Scottish Gaelic, but the popular English translation is limited to five. The melody, \"Cumha Mhic Arois\" (lament for Mac Àrois), is from the Hebrides and was a sung as a protective charm for the fisherman away at sea. The rhythm mirrors the rhythm of the surf. It is sung in the Hebrides at Midnight Mass of Christmas Eve.\n\nIn some apocryphal texts, the Infancy Gospels grew up with legendary accounts of the intervening period, and these are sometimes depicted. These stories were intended to show Jesus as having extraordinary gifts of power and knowledge, even from the youngest age. One common pious tale has the young Jesus animating sparrows out of clay belonging to his playmates. When admonished for doing so on the Sabbath, he causes the birds to fly away.\n\nSeveral historically significant images of Jesus Christ as a child have received Canonical Coronations from the Pope, namely the Infant Jesus of Prague, the Santo Niño de Cebú in the Philippines, and the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli in Rome.\n\nIn the seventeenth century veneration of the Christ Child under the title the \"Little King of Beaune\" was promoted by French Carmelites. In the late nineteenth century devotion to the Holy Child of Remedy developed in Madrid.\n\n"}

He was a Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign.\n\nMacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East. A series of disasters followed, starting with the destruction of his air force on December 8, 1941, and the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese. MacArthur's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to Bataan, where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left Corregidor in PT boats, and escaped to Australia, where MacArthur became Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area. For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines. He officially accepted Japan's surrender on September 2, 1945.\n\nOn July 26, 1941 Roosevelt federalized the Philippine Army, recalled MacArthur to active duty in the U.S. Army as a two star/major general, and named him commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). MacArthur was promoted to lieutenant general the following day, and then to general on December 20. At the same time, Sutherland was promoted to major general, while Marshall, Spencer B. Akin, and Hugh John Casey were all promoted to brigadier general. On July 31, 1941 the Philippine Department had 22,000 troops assigned, 12,000 of whom were Philippine Scouts. The main component was the Philippine Division, under the command of Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright. Between July and December 1941 the garrison received 8,500 reinforcements. After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, a backlog of 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels.\n\nAt 0330 local time on December 8, 1941, Sutherland learned of the attack on Pearl Harbor and informed MacArthur. At 0530, Chief of Staff of the United States Army General George Marshall ordered MacArthur to execute the existing war plan, Rainbow Five. MacArthur did nothing. When, on three occasions, Gen. Breteron requested permission to attack Japanese bases in Formosa (now called Taiwan), in accordance with prewar intentions, he was refused. At 12:30, the Japanese pilots of the 11th Air Fleet achieved complete tactical surprise when they attacked Clark Field and the nearby fighter base at Iba Field. They destroyed or disabled 18 of Far East Air Force's 35 B-17s, 53 of its 107 P-40s, three P-35s, and more than 25 other aircraft. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded. What was left of the Far East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.\nPrewar defense plans assumed the Japanese could not be prevented from landing on Luzon and called for U.S. and Filipino forces to abandon Manila and retreat with their supplies to the Bataan peninsula. MacArthur attempted to slow the Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. However, he reconsidered his confidence in the ability of his Filipino troops when the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at Lingayen Gulf on December 21. He subsequently ordered a retreat to Bataan. Manila was declared an open city and on December 25 MacArthur moved his headquarters to the island fortress of Corregidor in Manila Bay. A series of air raids by the Japanese destroyed all the exposed structures on the island and USAFFE headquarters was moved into the Malinta Tunnel. Later most of the headquarters moved to Bataan, leaving only the nucleus with MacArthur. The troops on Bataan knew that they had been written off but continued to fight. Some blamed Roosevelt and MacArthur for their predicament. A ballad sung to the tune of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" called him \"Dugout Doug.\" However, most clung to the belief that somehow MacArthur \"would reach down and pull something out of his hat.\"\n\nOn January 1, 1942 MacArthur was offered and accepted a payment of $500,000 ($ million in current value) from President Quezon of the Philippines as payment for his pre-war service. MacArthur's staff members also received payments: $75,000 for Sutherland, $45,000 for Richard Marshall, and $20,000 for Huff. Eisenhower, after being appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force, was also offered money by Quezon, but declined. These payments were known only to a few in Manila and Washington, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, until they were made public by historian Carol Petillo in 1979. While the payments had been fully legal, the revelation tarnished MacArthur's reputation.\n\nIn February 1942, as Japanese forces tightened their grip on the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate to Australia. MacArthur discussed the idea with his staff that he resign his commission and fight on as a private soldier in the Philippine resistance but Sutherland talked him out of it. On the night of March 12, 1942, MacArthur and a select group (that included his wife Jean and son Arthur, as well as Sutherland, Akin, Casey, Marshall, Willoughby, Diller, and George) left Corregidor in four PT boats. MacArthur, his family and Sutherland traveled in \"PT 41\", commanded by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley. The others followed in \"PT 34\", \"PT 35\" and \"PT 32\". MacArthur and his party reached Del Monte Airfield in Bukidnon province on the island of Mindanao two days later. General George Marshall sent three U.S. Navy B-17s to pick them up. Two of them arrived, and brought the entire group to Australia.\nMacArthur arrived on March 17 at Batchelor Airfield, about south of Darwin, before flying to Alice Springs, where he took the Ghan through the Australian outback to Adelaide. His famous speech, in which he said, \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return\", was first made at Terowie, a small railway township in South Australia on March 20. Upon his arrival in Adelaide, MacArthur abbreviated this to the now-famous, \"I came through and I shall return\" that made headlines. Washington asked MacArthur to amend his promise to, \"We shall return\". He ignored the request. Bataan eventually surrendered on April 9, and Wainwright surrendered on Corregidor on May 6.\n\nFor his leadership in the defense of the Philippines, General Marshall decided to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor, the decoration for which he had twice previously been nominated. It was admitted that MacArthur had not actually performed acts of valor in battle on Bataan but the 1927 award to Charles Lindbergh set a precedent. MacArthur chose to accept the medal on the basis that \"this award was intended not so much for me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command.\" Arthur MacArthur, Jr. and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001 when Theodore Roosevelt was awarded posthumously for his service during the Spanish–American War, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. having received one posthumously for his service during World War II.\n\n On April 18, 1942, MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). Lieutenant General George Brett became Commander, Allied Air Forces, and Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary became Commander, Allied Naval Forces (though neither of these men were of MacArthur's choosing). Since the bulk of land forces in the theater were Australian, General Marshall insisted an Australian be appointed as Commander, Allied Land Forces, and the job went to General Sir Thomas Blamey. Although predominantly Australian and American, MacArthur's command also included small numbers of personnel from the Netherlands East Indies, the United Kingdom, and other countries. MacArthur established a close relationship with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had been imposed upon them.\n\nThe staff of MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was built around the nucleus that had escaped from the Philippines with him, who became known as the \"Bataan Gang\". Though Roosevelt and General Marshall pressed for Dutch and Australian officers to be assigned to GHQ, the heads of all the staff divisions were American and such officers of other nationalities as were assigned served under them. Initially located in Melbourne, the GHQ was moved to Brisbane in July because Brisbane was the northernmost city in Australia with the necessary communications facilities. GHQ occupied the Australian Mutual Provident Society building (renamed after the war as MacArthur Chambers). MacArthur's office and Willoughby's G-2 section were located on the 8th floor (now the MacArthur Museum), while other staff sections occupied the four floors below.\n\nMacArthur formed his own signals intelligence organization, known as the Central Bureau, from Australian intelligence units and American cryptanalysts who had escaped from the Philippines; this unit forwarded Ultra information to Willoughby for analysis. After a press dispatch revealed details of the Japanese naval concentration at Rabaul during the Battle of the Coral Sea, President Roosevelt ordered that censorship be imposed in Australia. The Advisory War Council subsequently granted censorship authority to the GHQ over the Australian press. Australian newspapers were henceforth restricted to what was reported in the daily GHQ communiqué. Veteran correspondents considered them \"a total farce\" and characterized them as \"Alice-in-Wonderland information handed out at high level.\"\n\nAnticipating that the Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the garrison was strengthened and MacArthur ordered the establishment of new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to plans to exploit this victory with a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for an attack on the main Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the U.S. Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance, with the first, the seizure of the Tulagi area, being conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas command, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be conducted under MacArthur's command as Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area.\nThe Japanese struck first, landing at Buna in July, and at Milne Bay in August. The Australians soon defeated the Japanese at Milne Bay, but a series of defeats in the Kokoda Track campaign had a depressing effect back in Australia. On August 30, MacArthur radioed Washington that unless action was taken, the New Guinea Force would be overwhelmed. Having committed all the available Australian troops, MacArthur decided to send American troops. The 32nd Infantry Division, a poorly trained United States National Guard division, was selected to carry out a flanking maneuver. A series of embarrassing American reverses in the Battle of Buna-Gona led to outspoken criticism of the American troops by Blamey and other Australians. MacArthur sent Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger to \"take Buna, or not come back alive.\" MacArthur moved the advanced echelon of GHQ to Port Moresby on November 6, 1942. Buna finally fell on January 3, 1943. MacArthur awarded the Distinguished Service Cross to twelve officers for \"precise execution of operations.\" This use of the country's second highest award aroused some resentment, because while some, like Eichelberger and Major General George Alan Vasey, had fought in the field, others, like Sutherland and Willoughby, had not. For his part, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Medal, and the Australian government made him an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.\nMacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces SWPA, and in August 1942 selected Major General George C. Kenney to replace him. Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's ground forces would soon prove critical to Blamey's victory in the Battle of Wau. In September 1942, Vice Admiral Leary was replaced by Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender as commander of Allied Naval Forces SWPA. At that time, MacArthur's naval assets (commonly referred to as \"MacArthur's Navy\") consisted of only 5 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 20 submarines and 7 small craft. This fleet became the Seventh Fleet on 15 March 1943, in advance of Operation Cartwheel.\n\nAt the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved General MacArthur's plan for Operation Cartwheel, an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. MacArthur explained his strategy:\nLieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth Army headquarters arrived in SWPA in early 1943 but MacArthur had only three American divisions, and they were tired and depleted from the fighting at Buna and Guadalcanal. As a result, \"it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army.\"\n\nIn New Guinea, a country without roads, large-scale transportation of men and material would have to be accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942. Barbey's force formed part of Carpender's newly formed Seventh Fleet. Carpender reported to MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander, SWPA, but to Admiral Ernest King as Commander Seventh Fleet, which was part of King's United States Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations SWPA was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force. Although a few long-range P-38 Lightning fighters had arrived in SWPA in late 1942, further deliveries were suspended owing to the demands of Operation Torch.\nThe main offensive began with the landing at Lae by Major General George Wootten's Australian 9th Division and the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade on September 4, 1943. The next day MacArthur watched the landing at Nadzab by paratroops of the 503rd Parachute Infantry from a B-17 circling overhead. The B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but MacArthur insisted that it fly on to Nadzab. For this, MacArthur was awarded the Air Medal.\n\nVasey's Australian 7th Division and Wooten's 9th Division converged on Lae, which fell on September 16. MacArthur advanced his timetable, and ordered the 7th Division to capture Kaiapit and Dumpu, while the 9th Division mounted an amphibious assault on Finschhafen. Here, the offensive bogged down. Part of the problem was that MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen when there were actually nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.\nIn early November, MacArthur's plan for a westward advance along the coast of New Guinea to the Philippines was incorporated into plans for the war against Japan approved at the Cairo Conference. Three months later, airmen reported no signs of enemy activity in the Admiralty Islands. Although his intelligence staff did not agree that the islands had been evacuated, MacArthur ordered an amphibious landing on Los Negros Island, marking the beginning of the Admiralty Islands campaign. MacArthur accompanied the assault force aboard , the flagship of Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, who had recently replaced Carpender as commander of the Seventh Fleet. MacArthur, who came ashore with Kinkaid only seven hours after the first wave of landing craft, was awarded the Bronze Star for his actions in this campaign. After six weeks of fierce fighting, the 1st Cavalry Division captured the islands; the campaign officially ended on 18 May 1944.\n\nMacArthur now bypassed the Japanese forces at Hansa Bay and Wewak, and assaulted Hollandia and Aitape, which Willoughby reported to be lightly defended. Although they were out of range of the Fifth Air Force's fighters based in the Ramu Valley, the timing of the operation allowed the aircraft carriers of the Pacific Fleet to provide air support. Though risky, the operation turned out to be a brilliant success. MacArthur caught the Japanese off balance and cut off Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's Japanese XVIII Army in the Wewak area. Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light. However, the terrain turned out to be less suitable for airbase development than first thought, forcing MacArthur to seek better locations further west. Moreover, while bypassing Japanese forces had great tactical merit, it had the serious strategic drawback of tying up large numbers of Allied troops in order to contain them, and Adachi was far from beaten. In the Battle of Driniumor River, he would bring on \"the New Guinea campaign's bloodiest and most strategically useless battle.\"\n\nIn July 1944, President Roosevelt summoned MacArthur to meet with him in Hawaii \"to determine the phase of action against Japan.\" Nimitz and MacArthur agreed that the next step should be to advance on the southern and central Philippines. MacArthur emphasized the moral and political issues involved in a decision to liberate or bypass Luzon. He also spoke briefly of his plan to use the Australian Army to liberate Indonesia. Although the issue was not settled, both Roosevelt and Leahy were convinced of the soundness of MacArthur's plan. In September, Halsey's carriers made a series of air strikes on the Philippines. Opposition was feeble and Halsey concluded that Leyte was \"wide open\" and possibly undefended, and recommended that projected operations be skipped in favor of an assault on Leyte.\nOn October 20, 1944, troops of Krueger's Sixth Army landed on Leyte, while MacArthur watched from . That afternoon he arrived off the beach. The advance had not progressed far; snipers were still active and the area was under sporadic mortar fire. When his whaleboat grounded in knee-deep water, MacArthur requested a landing craft, but the beachmaster was too busy to grant his request. MacArthur was compelled to wade ashore. In his prepared speech he said:\nSince Leyte was out of range of Kenney's land-based aircraft, MacArthur was entirely dependent on carrier aircraft for cover. Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on Tacloban, where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on \"Nashville\"s bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and two nearby cruisers were hit. Over the next few days, the Imperial Japanese Navy staged a major counterattack in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. MacArthur attributed the near-disaster to command being divided between himself and Nimitz. Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. The timing of the assault so late in the year forced the combat troops, pilots, and the supporting logistical units to contend with heavy monsoonal rains that disrupted the airbase construction program. Adverse weather and valiant Japanese resistance slowed the American advance ashore. MacArthur was forced to ask Nimitz to recall the carriers to support the Sixth Army but they proved to be no substitute for land-based aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese Army to pour troops into Leyte. By the end of December, Krueger's headquarters estimated that 5,000 Japanese remained on Leyte, and on December 26 MacArthur issued a communiqué announcing that \"the campaign can now be regarded as closed except for minor mopping up.\" Yet Eichelberger's Eighth Army would kill more than 27,000 Japanese on Leyte between then and the end of the campaign in May 1945. On December 18, 1944, MacArthur was promoted to the new five-star rank of General of the Army — one day before Nimitz was promoted to Fleet Admiral, also a five-star rank. MacArthur had a Filipino silversmith make the rank badges from American, Australian, Dutch and Filipino coins.\n\nMacArthur's next move was the invasion of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites around the San Jose area. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. A parachute drop was considered, but the airfields on Leyte lacked the space to hold the required transport aircraft. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on the \"Nashville\". As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck \"Nashville\", killing 133 people and wounding 190 more, including the task force commander, Brigadier General William C. Dunkel. The landings were made unopposed on December 15, 1944, and within two weeks Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation, but \"not since Anzio had the navy experienced so much difficulty supporting an amphibious operation after the initial landing.\" The resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikaze aircraft and on December 26–27 a Japanese naval force attacked the area, sinking a destroyer and damaging other ships.\nThe way was now clear for the invasion of Luzon. This time, based on different interpretations of the same intelligence data, Willoughby's G-2 Section at GHQ estimated the strength of General Tomoyuki Yamashita's forces on Luzon at 137,000, while that of Sixth Army estimated it at 234,000. The Sixth Army Brigadier General Clyde D. Eddleman attempted to lay out the reasons for the Sixth Army's assessment, but MacArthur's response was \"Bunk!\". He felt that even Willoughby's estimate was too high. \"Audacity, calculated risk, and a clear strategic aim were MacArthur's attributes,\" and he was prepared to disregard the intelligence estimates. However, all the estimates were too low: Yamashita had more than 287,000 troops on Luzon. This time MacArthur traveled on the , watching as the ship was near-missed by a bomb and torpedoes fired by midget submarines. The GHQ communiqué read: \"The decisive battle for the liberation of the Philippines and the control of the Southwest pacific is at hand. General MacArthur is in personal command at the front and landed with his assault troops.\"\n\nMacArthur's primary concern was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were required to support future operations. He urged his front line commanders on. On January 25, 1945 he moved his advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger's at Calasiao. On January 30, MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division's commander, Major General Verne D. Mudge, to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. On February 3, it reached the northern outskirts of Manila and the campus of the University of Santo Tomas where 3,700 internees were liberated. Unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged for the next three weeks. In order to spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except for emergencies. Most of MacArthur's 8,000-volume military library, which included books inherited from his father, was lost. Nonetheless, he continued his habit of reading military history and biography until his death. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nAlthough MacArthur had no specific directive from the Joint Chiefs to do so, and the fighting on Luzon was far from over, he committed the Eighth Army, Seventh Fleet and Thirteenth Air Force to a series of operations to liberate the remainder of the Philippines from the Japanese. A series of 52 amphibious landings were made in the central and southern Philippines between February and July 1945. In the GHQ communiqué on July 5, MacArthur announced that the Philippines had now been liberated and all operations ended, although Yamashita still held out in northern Luzon. Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the invasion of Borneo. MacArthur accompanied the assault on Labuan on USS \"Boise\", and visited the troops ashore, along with Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. En route back to his headquarters in Manila, he visited Davao, where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao. A few months later, six times that number would surrender. In July 1945, he set out on \"Boise\" once more to be with the Australian 7th Division for the landing at Balikpapan. MacArthur was awarded his fourth Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nIn April 1945, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC), in charge of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific, except the Twentieth Air Force. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. GHQ became AFPAC headquarters in addition to SWPA. MacArthur created two new commands, AFMIDPAC under Lieutenant General Robert C. Richardson, Jr., and AFWESPAC under Lieutenant General Wilhelm D. Styer, which absorbed USASOS and USAFFE. This reorganization, which took some months to actually accomplish, was part of preparations for Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. The first phase, the invasion of Kyushu, known as Operation Olympic, was scheduled to commence on November 1, 1945. The invasion was pre-empted by the surrender of Japan in August 1945. On September 2, MacArthur accepted the formal Japanese surrender aboard , thus ending hostilities in World War II. In recognition of his role as a maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.\n\n"}

She has co-written nine books with her husband Jerry Hicks, presented numerous workshops on the law of attraction with Abraham Hicks Publications and appeared in the original version of the 2006 film \"The Secret\". The Hicks' books, including the series \"The Law of Attraction\", are — according to Esther Hicks — \"translated from a group of non-physical entities called Abraham.\" Hicks describes what she is doing as tapping into \"infinite intelligence\".\n\nEsther Weaver was born in Coalville, Utah. In 1980 she married Jerry Hicks, then a successful Amway distributor. In his early life Jerry Hicks had been a circus acrobat for two years in Cuba, and then, beginning in 1948, had toured for 20 years as a musician, MC, and comedian. Esther has one daughter, Tracy, by her former marriage. Jerry Hicks died on 18 November 2011 from cancer.\n\nAccording to Esther and Jerry Hicks, \"Abraham\" consists of a group of entities which are \"interpreted\" by Esther Hicks. Abraham have described themselves as \"a group consciousness from the non-physical dimension\". They have also said, \"We are that which you are. You are the leading edge of that which we are. We are that which is at the heart of all religions.\" Abraham has said through Esther that, whenever one feels moments of great love, exhilaration, or pure joy, that is the energy of source and that is who Abraham is.\n\nEsther herself calls Abraham \"infinite intelligence\", and to Jerry they are \"the purest form of love I've ever experienced\". Her teachings (known as \"Abraham–Hicks teachings\") are based on this experience. The basic tenets of the teachings includes one that says that people create their own reality through their attention and focus. Emotions are a person's guidance system that indicate how close or distant that person is to how their Source feels about a particular topic of focus. Life is meant to be fun and easy. The essence of Abraham–Hicks' teachings since 1986 has been presented as follows:\n\n\nA large part of Hicks' work centers around the law of attraction, a concept which William Walker Atkinson (1862–1932) wrote about in his book \"Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World\" (1906).\n\nEsther Hicks narrated and appeared in the original version of the film \"The Secret\", as well as being a central source of the film's inspiration. The footage featuring Hicks was removed from the later \"Extended Edition\" after the film's creator Rhonda Byrne, who has been involved in contractual disputes and litigation regarding the film, rescinded the original contract covering Hicks' participation, and asked that Hicks relinquish her \"intellectual property rights in these areas forever\". In an open letter posted on the internet, Hicks stated that she had been \"uncomfortable with what felt to us like a rather aggressive marketing campaign,\" and that ultimately Abraham gave her the following advice: \"Whenever you are given an ultimatum that says, 'if you don't do this, then we will have to do such and such,' it is best that you just let it go and move on. Otherwise there is always another, and this, and this, and this.\" The letter doesn't condemn Byrne, but clarifies why Hicks no longer appears in \"The Secret\".\n\nHicks has since posted a video on YouTube further explaining her discomfort with \"The Secret\" and finally, her decision to discontinue involvement with the film.\n\nHay House, Inc. published the Hicks' book, \"Ask and it is Given\", in September 2004. Since that book they have also published \"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\" (January 2006), \"The Law of Attraction\" (October 2006), \"The Astonishing Power of Emotions\" (September 2008), \"Money and the Law of Attraction: Learning to Attract Health, Wealth & Happiness,\" and \"The Vortex: Where the Law of Attraction Assembles All Cooperative Relationships\" (2009). A series of fictional children's books, \"Sara I\", \"II\", and \"III\", is also available. Several of their books were translated into Spanish, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Swedish, Czech, Croatian, Slovenian, Slovak, Serbian, Romanian, Russian and Japanese.\n\n\n\n"}

He is married with four children.\n\nHe holds a Doctorate of History from the University Paris Diderot. Between 1979 and 2007, he published many books and articles about Rwandan history. \n\nUnder the terms of the Arusha peace agreements, he was nominated as Higher Education Minister for Culture and Scientific Research. He was regarded as ideologue of the \"Hutu Power\" movement in Rwanda, and a member of President Habyarimana's inner circle. Nahimana co-founded the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR) party.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1994, Nahimana is alleged to have written and published articles encouraging an uprising against the Tutsis and moderate Hutus.\n\nHaving been dismissed from the Rwandan National Radio in 1993, he took part in the creation of the “Radio Télévision Libre des Milles Collines (RTLM)”, and according to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), became its director. Due to this involvement, he was accused of having \"directly encouraged\" the killings. Between April 1993 and 31 July 1994, Ferdinand Nahimana was accused of having planned, directed and supported the broadcasts of the RTLM. The ICTR prosecutor alleged that “he was aware of the programmes and the effect that these programmes had on the population”.\n\nHe was further accused of having organised, with the assistance of his brother, meetings between the MRND and the Interahamwe military in the Ruhengeri Prefecture, with the intent of discussing the killings of Tutsis and Hutus.\n\nIn April 1994, as the violence erupted in Rwanda after President Juvénal Habyarimana's death in a plane crash, the French embassy took Ferdinand Nahimana in, thereby helping him escape to Burundi. He was later arrested in Cameroon on 27 March 1996. Nahimana returned to Rwanda following Operation Turquoise through Zaire. Nahimana was arrested in Cameroon 26 March 1996.\n\nNahimana was prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, together with two others who had been involved with the RTLM: Hassan Ngeze and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza. Nahimana claimed that he was innocent and denied having editorial control of the RTLM broadcasts during the killings: \"I couldn't recognise the RTLM of those days from the one that existed before 6 April. It had been appropriated by radicals, what are now called extremists, whose way of seeing and doing things I did not share\".\n\nThe \"hate media trials\" received attention since it was the first time since the Nuremberg trials that hate speech had been prosecuted as a war crime. On December 3, 2003, Ferdinand Nahimana was sentenced to life imprisonment, guilty of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, incitement, directly and publicly, to commit genocide, complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity. Hassan Ngeze also got a life sentence, and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Despite the sentences' possible impact on freedom of the press, Reporters Without Borders welcomed the outcome of the trial.\n\nNahimana, founder of the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille collines (RTLM) was convicted for his responsibility as a senior ranking official on the radio starting 6 April 1994, date on which he no longer exerted any role, according to his French lawyer Jean-Marie Biju- Duval. \n\nThe Rwandan historian was convicted for having done nothing to stop the inflammatory content of the RTLM radio programmes after 6 April 1994, as he had, according to the judgment, an authority on the personnel of the radio station. \n\nFerdinand Nahimana appealed his conviction, and the trial before the Appeals Chamber opened on 16 January 2007. On 28 November 2007, the Appeals Chamber reduced his prison term to 30 years. The Appeals Chamber overturned some of his convictions, notably those which concerned events that had taken place before 1994. The Appeals Chamber also overturned the initial conclusion that there had been an agreement between the RTLM, the CDR, and Kangura to assist in committing genocide. It therefore reversed the charges against Nahimana under Article 6(1) of the Stature, but upheld those under Article 6(3)—namely, those of \"inciting directly and publicly to the commission of genocide and for persecution as a crime against humanity\" by means of the RTLM broadcasts after 6 April 1994.\n\nIn December 2008, he has been transferred from Arusha (Tanzania) to Mali (in West Africa).\n\nA 2010 book written by journalist and historian Hervé Deguine argues that the motives invoked in Nahimana's trial were based on very little evidence except that he founded and was one of the owners of the radio station, exposing arguments and circumstantial evidence against his conviction. He concludes his book by affirming that on the basis of judicial proofs, Nahimana should be released.\n\n"}
{"id": "441735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441735", "title": "Frances Farmer", "text": "Frances Farmer\n\nFrances Elena Farmer (September 19, 1913August 1, 1970) was an American actress and television host. She appeared in over a dozen feature films over the course of her career, though she garnered notoriety for the various sensationalized accounts of her life, especially her involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital and subsequent mental health struggles.\n\nA native of Seattle, Washington, Farmer began acting in stage productions while a student at the University of Washington. After graduating, she began performing in stock theater before signing a film contract with Paramount Pictures in 1936. She made her film debut in \"Too Many Parents\" (1936), followed by a lead role in the musical western, \"Rhythm on the Range\" (1936). Unhappy with the opportunities given to her by the studio, Farmer returned to stock theater in 1937 before being cast in the original Broadway production of Clifford Odets's \"Golden Boy\", staged by New York City's Group Theatre. She followed this with two Broadway productions directed by Elia Kazan in 1939, but a battle with depression and binge drinking caused her to drop out of a subsequent Ernest Hemingway stage adaptation.\n\nFarmer returned to Los Angeles, earning supporting roles in the comedy \"World Premiere\" (1941) and the film noir \"Among the Living\" (1941). In 1942, publicity of her reportedly erratic behavior began to surface, and after several arrests and committals to psychiatric institutions, Farmer was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. At the request of her family, particularly her mother, she was relocated to an institution in her home state of Washington, where she remained a patient until 1950. Farmer attempted an acting comeback, mainly appearing as a television host in Indianapolis on her own series, \"Frances Farmer Presents\". Her final film role was in the 1958 drama \"The Party Crashers\", after which she spent the majority of the 1960s occasionally performing in local theater productions staged by Purdue University. In the spring of 1970, she was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, of which she died several months later, aged 56.\n\nShe has been the subject of various works, including two feature films and several books, many of which focus heavily on her time spent institutionalized, during which she claimed to have been subject to various systemic abuses. Her posthumously-released autobiography, \"Will There Really Be a Morning?\" (1972) details these claims significantly. A disputed 1978 biography of her life, \"Shadowland\", alleged that Farmer underwent a transorbital lobotomy during her institutionalization, and a 1982 biographical film based on her life depicted this event as truth, resulting in renewed interest in her life and career.\n\nFrances Elena Farmer was born on September 19, 1913 in Seattle, Washington, the daughter of Lillian (née Van Ornum; 18731955), a boardinghouse operator and dietician and Ernest Melvin Farmer (18741956), a lawyer. Her father was originally from Spring Valley, Minnesota, while her mother was from Oregon, and a descendant of pioneers. Farmer had an older sister, Edith; one older brother, Wesley, and an older half-sister, Rita, conceived during her mother's first marriage. Prior to the birth of Wesley and Edith, Ernest and Lillian had given birth to a daughter who died of pneumonia in infancy. When she was four years old, Farmer's parents separated, and her mother relocated with the children from their home in North Seattle to Los Angeles, where her sister Zella was living. In early 1925, the family moved north to Chico, California, where Lillian pursued a career performing nutrition research. Shortly after arriving in Chico, Lillian concluded that caring for the children was interfering with her ability to work. The children's Aunt Zella then drove them to Albany, Oregon, where they boarded a train back to Seattle to live with their father.\nFarmer's inconsistent home life had a notable effect on her, and upon returning to Seattle, she recalled: \"In certain ways, that train trip represented the end of my dependent childhood. I began to understand that there were certain things one could expect from adults, and others that one could not expect...  being shunted from one household to another was a new adjustment, a fresh confusion, and I groped for ways to compensate for the disorder.\" The following year, her mother returned to Seattle after her home in Chico burned down in a house fire. In Seattle, the family shared a household, though Lillian and Ernest remained separated despite his attempts to reconcile their marriage. In the fall of 1929, when Farmer was sixteen, Lillian and Ernest divorced, and Lillian relocated to a cottage in Bremerton, Washington, while the children remained with their father.\n\nIn 1931, while a senior at West Seattle High School, Farmer entered and won $100 from The Scholastic Art & Writing Awards, a writing contest sponsored by \"Scholastic Magazine\", with her controversial essay \"God Dies.\" It was a precocious attempt to reconcile her wish for, in her words, a \"superfather\" God, with her observations of a chaotic and godless world. In her autobiography, she wrote that the essay was influenced by her reading of Friedrich Nietzsche: \"He expressed the same doubts, only he said it in German: 'Gott ist tot.' God is dead. This I could understand. I was not to assume that there was no God, but I could find no evidence in my life that He existed or that He had ever shown any particular interest in me. I was not an atheist, but I was surely an agnostic, and by the time I was sixteen I was well indoctrinated into this theory.\"\n\nAfter graduating high school, Farmer enrolled at the University of Washington, initially majoring in journalism. She worked various odd jobs to pay her tuition, including as an usherette in a cinema, a waitress, a tutor, and a laborer in a soap factory. For a time, she also worked as a singing waitress at Mount Rainier National Park. During her sophomore year, Farmer became involved with the university's drama department productions, which were considered citywide cultural events and were frequented accordingly. While a student at UW, Farmer starred in numerous plays, including \"Helen of Troy\", \"Everyman\", and \"Uncle Vanya\". In late 1934, she starred in the UW production of \"Alien Corn\", which earned her favorable reviews in local press.\n\nDuring her final year of college in 1935, Farmer won a subscription contest for the leftist newspaper, \"The Voice of Action\". The first prize was a trip to the Soviet Union—Farmer accepted the prize, despite her mother's strong objections, so that she could see the pioneering Moscow Art Theatre. Farmer's interest in such topics fostered speculations that Farmer was not only an atheist, but a Communist as well. The same year, she graduated from the university earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama.\n\nReturning from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1935, Farmer stopped in New York City, hoping to launch a legitimate theater career. There she met talent agent Shepard Traube, who referred her to Paramount Pictures talent scout Oscar Serlin, who arranged for a screen test. Paramount offered her a seven-year contract, which Farmer signed in New York City on her 22nd birthday. After completing screen tests in Long Island, Farmer relocated to Los Angeles to begin working for Paramount. Upon arriving, she underwent dental surgery to fix a gap in her front teeth, and spent long hours screen-testing and training on the Paramount studio lot. In November 1935, she was cast in the B-movie \"Too Many Parents\" (1936), a comedy about young men in military school. The film was a box office success. After completing the film in February 1936, Farmer wed fellow Paramount contract player Leif Erickson, whom she met on the studio lot. She was then cast in a lead role in the drama \"Border Flight\".\n\nLater that year, Farmer was cast in her first \"A\" feature, \"Rhythm on the Range\", a Western starring Bing Crosby. She recalled of the film: \"I had had a crush on him [Crosby] since my high school days, and stood in awe of the fact that in my first important film I was actually working as his leading lady.\" \"Rhythm on the Range\" earned favorable reviews and brought Farmer an enhanced public reputation. After its release, Paramount studio head Adolph Zukor phoned her and told her that \"now that she was a rising star she'd have to start acting like one.\" Farmer was resistant, however, and spent most of her time at her home in Laurel Canyon with Erickson, forgoing invitations to Hollywood parties and events. In an attempt to make Farmer marketable, Paramount chose to brand her in press releases as \"the star who would not go Hollywood,\" focusing on her \"eccentric\" fashion tastes.\n\nDuring the summer of 1936, she was loaned to Samuel Goldwyn to appear in \"Come and Get It\", based on the novel by Edna Ferber, in which she portrayed a young woman who falls in love with her mother's husband. Howard Hawks was originally signed to direct, but was replaced by William Wyler midway through production; Farmer was indignant and clashed with Wyler during filming. He would later state: \"The nicest thing I can say about Frances Farmer is that she is unbearable.\" Though her working relationship with Wyler was tumultuous, Hawks remembered Farmer admirably, saying that she \"had more talent that anyone I ever worked with.\" Because it was set in the Pacific Northwest, producers chose to premiere the film in Seattle, Farmer's hometown. At the premiere, Farmer was notably quiet and spoke little to reporters, which resulted in news coverage branding her as cold and aloof. Despite this coverage of the premiere, \"Come and Get It\" earned praise from the public and critics, with several reviews greeting Farmer as a new found star, some likening her to Greta Garbo.\n\nIn 1937, she was loaned to RKO to star opposite Cary Grant in \"The Toast of New York\", the story of a Wall Street tycoon. The film's production was turbulent as Farmer was unhappy with the rebranding of her character from a hard-edged vixen to \"an ingénue fresh from Sunnybrook.\" On set, she argued with director Rowland V. Lee and gave belittling interviews to the press. Unsatisfied with the direction of her career after \"The Toast of New York\", Farmer resisted the studio's control and resisted every attempt they made to glamorize her private life. However, Farmer was sympathetically described in a 1937 \"Collier's\" article as being indifferent about the clothing she wore and was said to drive an older-model \"green roadster.\" Also in 1937, she appeared in the crime drama \"Exclusive\" opposite Fred MacMurray, and the Technicolor adventure film \"Ebb Tide\".\n\nUnsatisfied with the expectations of the studio system and wanting to enhance her reputation as a serious actress, Farmer left Hollywood in mid-1937 to do summer stock on the East Coast, performing in Westchester, New York and Westport, Connecticut. There, she attracted the attention of director Harold Clurman and playwright Clifford Odets, who invited her to appear in a three-month production of Odets' play \"Golden Boy\", produced by the Group Theatre. The play opened in November 1937 and ran for a total of 248 performances. Her performance at first received mixed reviews, with \"Time\" magazine commenting that she had been miscast. Due to Farmer's box office appeal, however, the play became the biggest hit in the Group's history. By 1938, when the production had embarked on a national tour, regional critics from Washington D.C. to Chicago gave her rave reviews.\nDuring the run of \"Golden Boy\", Farmer began a romantic affair with Odets, but he was married to actress Luise Rainer and did not offer Farmer a commitment. Farmer felt betrayed when Odets suddenly ended the relationship; and when the Group chose another actress for its London runan actress whose family helped secure funds for the playshe came to believe that the Group had used her drawing power selfishly to further the success of the play. Disheartened, Farmer returned to Los Angeles to star opposite husband Erickson in \"Ride a Crooked Mile\" (1938). In April 1939, she performed in a short-run Broadway production of \"Quiet City\", an experimental play directed by Elia Kazan. In November that year, she returned to Broadway portraying Melanie in \"Thunder Rock\", also directed by Kazan, and produced by the Group Theater. The play was not well-received, and Farmer was profoundly unhappy after its closing in December 1939. She subsequently accepted a role in a Broadway adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's \"The Fifth Column\", which she was scheduled to begin rehearsing in early 1940. During rehearsals, Farmer began binge drinking in an effort to alleviate her depression. She ultimately chose to withdraw from the production, resulting in a $1,500 fine from the Theater Guild, for \"unprofessionalism.\"\n\nShe returned to Paramount, who assigned her a role in \"South of Pago Pago\" (1940), in which she portrayed Ruby, a woman traveling with a group of adventurers searching for pearls on an island. She was then loaned to Warner Bros. to star in \"Flowing Gold\", an adventure drama set against the oil industry, opposite John Garfield. After completing the film, Farmer returned to the East Coast to appear in summer stock theater. Following a \"lonely winter\" spent living in New York City, Farmer drove back to Los Angeles in the spring of 1941, and rented a lavish mansion in Santa Monica. Her next film was \"World Premiere\" (1941), a comedy starring John Barrymore. She followed this with a supporting part in the film noir \"Among the Living\" (1941), co-starring with Susan Hayward and Albert Dekker.\n\nDuring this time, Farmer was \"seeking in work a respite from her personal struggles.\" Clurman temporarily moved into her Santa Monica home to keep her company while she completed filming of \"Badlands of Dakota\", a Western in which she starred as Calamity Jane opposite Robert Stack. Farmer again fought with the studio over the role, which she felt was over-glamorized, further damaging her reputation with studio executives. She next appeared opposite Tyrone Power and Roddy McDowall in the film \"Son of Fury\" (1942) (on loan-out to 20th Century Fox), portraying the scheming daughter of a British aristocrat. Later that year, Paramount suspended her after she refused to accept a part in the film \"Take a Letter, Darling\" and voided her contract. Meanwhile, her marriage to Erickson had disintegrated, and he began dating actress Margaret Hayes. Their divorce was finalized on June 12, 1942, and Erickson married Hayes the same day.\n\nOn October 19, 1942, Farmer was stopped by Santa Monica Police for driving with her headlights on bright in the wartime blackout zone that affected most of the West Coast. Some reports stated she was unable to produce a driver's license and was verbally abusive to the officers. The police suspected her of being drunk and she was jailed overnight. Farmer was fined $500 and given a 180-day suspended sentence. She immediately paid $250 and was put on probation. With her vehicle impounded and her driver's license suspended, Farmer holed up in her Santa Monica home and denied the press interviews.\nIn November 1942, her agent secured her a role in an independent film adaptation of John Steinbeck's \"Murder at Laudice\", which was set to film in Mexico City. Upon arriving in Mexico, she discovered that the shooting script was unfinished, and the production never reached fruition. While in Mexico City, Farmer was allegedly charged with drunk and disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace, and was forced by authorities to return to the United States. Upon returning to California, she found her Santa Monica home had been cleared of her possessions and inhabited by a strange family. Farmer would later contend that her mother and sister-in-law had stripped the house and stored her belongings while she was gone. Her mother rented her a room at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Hollywood, where she temporarily took residence.\n\nBy January 1943, Farmer had failed to pay the remainder of her fine, and a bench warrant was issued for her arrest. At almost the same time, a studio hairdresser filed an assault charge alleging that Farmer had hit her in the face and dislocated her jaw on set. Shortly after, Farmer was allegedly seen running down Sunset Boulevard topless after getting into a brawl at a bar. On January 14, 1943, police traced Farmer to the Knickerbocker and arrived at her room to arrest her. Getting no answer, they entered her room with a pass key. Farmer did not surrender peacefully, and was dragged out of the hotel nude to police headquarters.\n\nAt her hearing the following morning, Farmer behaved erratically: She claimed the police had violated her civil rights, demanded an attorney, and threw an inkwell at the judge, resulting in her being restrained by bailiffs. When asked about her drinking habits, Farmer told the judge: \"I put liquor in my milk...  in my coffee and in my orange juice.\" She also admitted to regularly drinking benzedrine. The judge ultimately sentenced her to 180 days in jail. While being escorted from the courtroom, Farmer lashed out, knocking down a policeman and bruising another, along with a matron; she ran to a phone booth where she tried to call her attorney, but was subdued by the police. When they physically carried her away, she shouted: \"Have you ever had a broken heart?\"\n\nThrough the efforts of her sister-in-law, a deputy sheriff in Los Angeles County, Farmer avoided jail time and was instead transferred to the psychiatric ward of Los Angeles General Hospital on January 20. There, she was diagnosed with \"manic depressive psychosis, probably the forerunner of a definite dementia praecox.\" Days later, with assistance from the Screen Actors Guild, she was transferred to the Kimball Sanitarium, a minimum-security psychiatric institute in the San Fernando Valley. Resident psychiatrists Donald A. Nicholson and George Price both examined Farmer, and formally diagnosed her with paranoid schizophrenia. She was administered insulin shock therapy, a treatment then accepted as standard psychiatric procedure, and whose side effects included intense nausea. Her family later claimed they did not give their consent to the treatment, as documented in her sister's self-published book, \"Look Back in Love\", and in court records; Farmer herself would later allege that she was given insulin treatments for 90 consecutive days. After spending nine months at the Kimball Sanitarium, Farmer walked out of the institute one afternoon and traveled to her half-sister Rita's house, over away. The pair then called their mother, Lillian, in Seattle to complain about the insulin treatments.\nLillian traveled to California and began a lengthy legal battle to take formal guardianship of her daughter from the state of California. Although several psychiatrists testified that Farmer needed further treatment, her mother prevailed. The two of them left Los Angeles by train on September 13, 1943. Farmer moved in with her parents in West Seattle, but she and her mother fought bitterly. Farmer wrote in her autobiography: \"Mamma and I had fought, argued, threatened, and screamed until it had finally come down to a climax of two exhausted women sitting across from each other in a small, cluttered kitchen. We were enemies who had grown tired of pretending.\" After one violent physical attack, Lillian had Farmer committed to Western State Hospital at Steilacoom, Washington. Three months later, in early July 1944, she was pronounced \"completely cured\" and released. Shortly after her release, on July 15, Farmer was arrested for vagrancy in Antioch, California.\n\nIn January 1945, Farmer's father brought her to stay at her aunt's ranch in Yerington, Nevada. During her stay, Farmer ran away from the residence. She was discovered several days later at a movie theater in Reno, and returned by police to her aunt's home. Several months later, on May 18, 1945, Lillian filed for a sanity hearing for Farmer after she ran away from their home in Seattle. The hearing was held on May 21, during which it was ruled that Farmer was be re-committed to Western State Hospital. She would remain an inmate of the hospital for the following five years, with the exception of a brief parole in 1946. Throughout her internment, Farmer remained in the high-security ward for the hospital's \"violent\" patients. Her treatment at Western State would be subject to significant public and critical discussion in the years after her death.\n\nOn March 23, 1950, at her parents' request, Farmer was paroled back into her mother's care. One year later, on March 25, 1951, Farmer was formally discharged from the jurisdiction of Western State, but was not made aware of it for two years; in the interim, she believed her re-commitment to the hospital an imminent threat. In June 1953, upon discovering her discharge, Farmer requested that her mother's conservatorship be lifted, which was successfully awarded by the Superior Court. With her freedom restored, Farmer took a job sorting laundry at the Olympic Hotel in Seattle, the same hotel where she had been fêted in 1936 at the world premiere of \"Come and Get It\". While working at the Olympic Hotel, a co-worker set Farmer up on a blind date with Alfred H. Lobley, a 45-year-old city utility worker. The two married in April 1954, and moved in with Farmer's mother Lillian, who was growing senile and needed assistance at home. Within the year, Lillian was sent to a nursing home, after which Farmer's marriage to Lobley began to disintegrate.\n\nFarmer remained estranged from her mother until her death of a stroke in March 1955. After their mother's death, Farmer's sister Edith relocated to Portland, Oregon to be nearer to their father, who died there the following year on July 15, 1956, also of a stroke. During this time, Farmer and Edith corresponded occasionally via letters. Edith claimed that on one occasion Farmer visited her in Portland, where the two spent an afternoon at The Grotto, a Catholic sanctuary they had once visited with their father.\nIn late 1957, Farmer separated from Lobley and relocated to Eureka, California, where she found work as a bookkeeper and secretary at a commercial photo studio. In Eureka, she met Leland C. Mikesell, an independent broadcast promoter from Indianapolis, who recognized her at a local bar. The two soon became romantic, and Mikesell envisioned a career comeback for her. They relocated to San Francisco, where Farmer temporarily worked as a clerk at the Park Sheraton Hotel. In 1958, she and Mikesell married.\n\nIn a December 1957 interview with \"Modern Screen\", Farmer said: \"I blame nobody for my fall. I had to face agonizing decisions when I was younger. The decisions broke me. But, too, there was a lack of philosophy in my life. With faith in myself and in God I think I have won the fight to control myself.\" She subsequently made two appearances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", during one of which she played guitar and sang \"Aura Lee,\" a folk song she had performed in \"Come and Get It\" (1936). She also appeared on \"This Is Your Life\", the latter program perceived by the actress as an opportunity to clarify the veracity of the publicity that she had received throughout her career thus far. Farmer explained to \"This is Your Life\"'s host, Ralph Edwards:\n\nEdwards later asked Farmer about her supposed alcoholism: \"Other stories accuse you of being an alcoholic. Were you, Frances?\" Farmer's reply was, \"No, I was never an alcoholic.\", an adamant denial that also applied to Edwards' subsequent question about \"dope.\"\n\nIn August 1957, Farmer returned to the stage in New Hope, Pennsylvania, for a summer stock production of Enid Bagnold's \"The Chalk Garden\". Through the spring of 1958, Farmer appeared in several live television dramas, some of which are preserved on kinescope; the same year, she made her last film, \"The Party Crashers\", a potboiler drama produced by Paramount and described by one writer as \"a crappy B-movie about wild teenagers and stupid adults.\" Then, in the July 1958, Farmer accepted the lead role in a production of \"Yes, My Darling Daughter\", due to the reciprocal arrangements that existed between one of the summer stock East Coast theaters that she performed in and venues in the Midwest; this particular role was based at a theater in Indianapolis.\n\nFarmer's stage work proved to be beneficial, as she received the opportunity to host her own daytime movie program, \"Frances Farmer Presents.\" The show was created after a television executive from the local National Broadcasting Company (NBC) affiliate, WFBM-TV (now known as WRTV), saw her performance in \"The Chalk Garden\" in August 1958. Farmer's television program made her popular as an amiable host, and she subsequently received an award as a local businesswoman of the year. However, by March 1959 national wire service reports indicated that she had separated from Mikesell, and that he was suing her for breach of contract. In 1959, Farmer moved in with Jeanira \"Jean\" Ratcliffe, a widow with whom she became good friends in Indianapolis.\n\nIn 1962, Farmer appeared in a Purdue University production of Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\". The following year, her divorce from Mikesell was finalized in Indianapolis. \"Frances Farmer Presents\" eventually ended at the end of the summer of 1964; the station's general manager had fired her in April of that year, hired her back two months later, but then dismissed Farmer permanently in late-August/early-September, aggravated by her alleged drinking binges. Farmer continued her stage work and accepted a role in a Purdue Summer Theatre production of Ketti Frings' \"Look Homeward, Angel\" after the demise of her television host role. In 1965, Farmer played the role of Claire Zachanassian in the university's production of Friedrich Dürrenmatt's \"The Visit\", which ran at the Loeb Playhouse on the Purdue University campus from October 22 to October 30, 1965; the latter production has been described in the following manner:\n\nDuring the production of \"The Visit\", Farmer was involved in a drunk-driving accident. When confronted by police, she recalled: \"Rather than answering as Frances Farmer, I reverted to my role in the play and [suddenly became] the richest woman in the world, shouting to high heaven that I would buy his goddamned town. I got out stiff-legged and ivory-handed, quoting all the imperious lines I could remember. Unfortunately, this did not [sit] well with the [cop], and a patrol car took me to jail.\" Ironically, following the appearance of the incident in the media, the next night's performance of \"The Visit\" completely sold out. Farmer was very reluctant to return to the stage, but was encouraged by Ratcliffe; Farmer recounted the experience of the performance in her autobiography: \"[T]here was a long silent pause as I stood there, followed by the most thunderous applause of my career. [The audience] swept the scandal under the rug with their ovation.\" It was \"my finest and final performance. I knew I would never need to act onstage again. I felt satisfied and rewarded.\"\n\nDuring the early and mid-1960s, Farmer was actress-in-residence at Purdue University, and spent the majority of her free time painting and writing poetry. Farmer and Ratcliffe attempted to start a small company producing cosmetics, but although their products were successfully field-tested, the project failed after their funds were embezzled by the man who handled their investment portfolio. In 1968, she formally converted to Roman Catholicism as she claimed to have felt God in her life and sensed that she \"would have to find a disciplined avenue of faith and worship.\" She recounted her experience: Farmer had a great affection for the Saint Joan of Arc church and attended services there regularly in her last years of life. During this period, she also gave up drinking, and began considering writing an autobiography: She negotiated a collaboration with Lois Kibbee, who encouraged her to tape-record her life story. The experience was emotionally jarring for Farmer, specifically the revisiting of medical records from her institutionalization. The book went unfinished, though Ratcliffe would utilize its manuscript in compiling Farmer's posthumously-released autobiography, \"Will There Really Be a Morning?\".\n\nFarmer was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the spring of 1970, which was attributed to her lifelong habit of heavy smoking. She was hospitalized for three weeks, before being sent home for a brief period. She died of the cancer at Indianapolis Community Hospital on August 1, 1970. She is interred at Oaklawn Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Fishers, Indiana.\n\nIn the years following Farmer's death in 1970, her treatment at Western State was the subject of serious discussion and wild speculation. Kenneth Anger included a chapter relating her breakdown in \"Hollywood Babylon\". Farmer's posthumously-published autobiography \"Will There Really Be a Morning?\", described a brutal incarceration. In the book, Farmer claimed she had been brutalized and mistreated in numerous ways. Some of the claims included being forced to eat her own feces and act as a sex slave for male doctors and orderlies. Farmer recounted her stay in the state asylum as \"unbearable terror\": \"I was raped by orderlies, gnawed on by rats and poisoned by tainted food. I was chained in padded cells, strapped into strait-jackets and half-drowned in ice baths.\"\n\nFarmer's close friend and housemate, Ratcliffe, arranged the publication of \"Will There Really Be a Morning?\". Controversy exists over what portions of the book Ratcliffe may have edited or ghostwritten. Ratcliffe claimed she only wrote the final chapter dealing with Farmer's death.\n\nIn 1978, Seattle film reviewer William Arnold published \"Shadowland,\" which for the first time alleged that Farmer had been the subject of a transorbital lobotomy. Scenes of Farmer being subjected to this lobotomy procedure were featured in the 1982 film \"Frances\", which had initially been planned as an adaptation of \"Shadowland\", though its producers ultimately reneged on their agreement with Arnold. During a court case against Brooksfilms (the film's producers), Arnold revealed that the lobotomy episode and much of his biography about Farmer was \"fictionalized\". Years later, on a DVD commentary track of the \"Frances\" movie, director Graeme Clifford stated, \"We didn't want to nickel and dime people to death with facts.\"\n\nFarmer's family, her former lovers, and her three ex-husbands all denied, or did not confirm, that the procedure was completed. Farmer's sister, Edith, said the hospital asked her parents' permission to perform the lobotomy, but her father was \"horrified\" by the notion and threatened legal action \"if they tried any of their guinea pig operations on her.\" Western State Hospital recorded all the lobotomies performed during Farmer's period there. Since a lobotomy was considered a ground-breaking medical procedure, the hospital did not attempt to conceal its work. Although nearly 300 patients received the procedure, no evidence supports a claim that Farmer was among them. In 1983, Seattle newspapers interviewed former hospital staff members, including all of the lobotomy ward nurses who were on duty during Farmer's years at Western State, and they all stated Farmer was never a patient on that ward. Dr. Walter Freeman's private patient records contained no mention of Farmer. Dr. Charles Jones, psychiatric resident at Western State during Farmer's stays, also stated that Farmer never underwent the lobotomy procedure.\n\nWriter Jeffrey Kauffmann published an extensive online essay titled \"Shedding Light on \"Shadowland\",\" which debunks numerous elements of Arnold's book, including the allegation regarding the lobotomy.\n\nIn 1982, Jessica Lange portrayed Farmer in the feature film \"Frances\"; the film depicts Farmer undergoing a lobotomy, the validity of which has been disputed in subsequent years. The following year, a television adaptation of Farmer's autobiography, \"Will There Really Be a Morning\", was released with Susan Blakely portraying her. Another feature film based on her life, \"Committed\", was produced in 1984.\n\nIn music, she is portrayed in the songs \"Ugly Little Dream\" (1985) by Everything but the Girl, \"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\" (1993) by Nirvana, and \"Frances Farmer\" by Patterson Hood. She was also the subject of a stage play by Sally Clark titled \"Saint Frances of Hollywood\" (1996).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1083304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1083304", "title": "Francis Dolarhyde", "text": "Francis Dolarhyde\n\nFrancis Dolarhyde is a fictional character and a primary antagonist of Thomas Harris' 1981 novel \"Red Dragon\".\n\nDolarhyde is a serial killer who murders entire families by shooting them in their beds. He is nicknamed \"The Tooth Fairy\" due to the nocturnal nature of his crimes, his tendency to bite his victims' bodies, the uncommon size and sharpness of his teeth and other apparent oral fixations. He kills at the behest of an alternate personality; he refers to his other self as \"The Great Red Dragon\" after William Blake's painting \"The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun\". He believes that killing people—or \"changing\" them, as he calls it—allows him to more fully \"become\" the Dragon.\n\nDolarhyde's backstory is supplied in the novel in detail and alluded to in the film adaptations. Born in Springfield, Missouri on June 14, 1938 with a cleft lip and palate, he is abandoned by his mother and cared for in an orphanage until the age of five. He is then taken in by his grandmother, who subjects him to severe emotional and physical abuse, culminating in an incident in which she forces him to place his own penis between the blades of a pair of scissors after wetting the bed and threatening to castrate him should he wet the bed again. Shortly afterwards, he begins torturing animals. After his grandmother becomes afflicted with dementia, Dolarhyde is turned over to the care of his estranged mother and her husband in St. Louis; he is further abused by this family. After his step-siblings smash his face into a bathroom mirror, Dolarhyde hangs his sister's cat and is sent back to the orphanage. After being caught breaking into a house at age 17, he enlists in the United States Army rather than serve prison time. While on his tour in Japan and neighboring countries, he learns how to develop film and receives cosmetic surgery for his cleft palate.\n\nAfter his honorable discharge, Dolarhyde gets a job with the Gateway Corp. in St. Louis, Missouri, as the production chief of their home movies division. He also takes up bodybuilding and becomes exceptionally strong; it is mentioned in the novel that even in middle age, Dolarhyde could have successfully competed in regional bodybuilding competitions, and at one point successfully cleans and presses 300 pounds (which approaches record-setting status for the late 1970s). \n\nIn his early 40s, Dolarhyde sees the William Blake painting \"The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun\", which gives voice to his alternate personality. Under the influence of \"The Red Dragon,\" Dolarhyde murders two families in two months, on or near a full moon. (The novel implies that he had killed before that, perhaps in Asia during his military service.) Dolarhyde chooses his victims through the home movies that he edits as a film processing technician. In the days leading up to a full moon, Dolarhyde kills or injures the family pet and then spends nights in their backyard, watching the moon. On the night of the full moon, Dolarhyde uses a glass cutter to gain entry to the homes, then shoots his victims in their beds before ritualistically posing them around the master bed and engaging in necrophilic acts with the mothers' corpses. He then implants shards of mirror glass into his victims' eyes so he can see his own \"transformation\" into the Dragon. Dolarhyde believes that he is subjecting his victims to a process called \"changing\" which is beneficial to them in addition to helping him \"become\" the Dragon. To facilitate the process of \"becoming,\" Dolarhyde travels to Hong Kong in order to have a rendering of the Blake dragon tattooed across his back and has two sets of false teeth made. One set is normal for his day-to-day life, while the other - based on a mold of his grandmother's deformed teeth - is ritualistically incorporated into the dragon persona he assumes during his killings. Due to the nocturnal nature of the murders and Dolarhyde's tendency to bite the corpses of his victims with the malformed dentures, the tabloid \"The National Tattler\" nicknames him \"The Tooth Fairy\", a nickname he hates.\n\nFBI profiler Will Graham is asked to return from early retirement to aid in his capture. Graham had previously captured Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer whom Dolarhyde idolizes, and to whom he sends a \"fan letter\" describing his murders. Graham visits Lecter in the Baltimore State Forensic Hospital for the Criminally Insane, hoping that the doctor would be able to help identify the killer or at least assist in creating a psychological profile. Following this meeting, Lecter \"helps\" by sending Dolarhyde Graham's address in code with the note, \"Save yourself - kill them all.\" FBI Agent-in-Charge Jack Crawford intercepts the message in time to warn Graham's family and the local sheriff.\n\nDolarhyde becomes obsessed with coverage of his murders in \"The National Tattler\" and collects clippings about Lecter's arrest and trial, about Graham, and about his own murders. In an attempt to provoke Dolarhyde out of hiding, Graham gives an interview to Freddy Lounds of \"The Tattler\", in which he says that \"The Tooth Fairy\" is impotent, homosexual, and possibly the product of incest; he also implies that Lecter is offended that the killer considers himself Lecter's equal. The interview enrages Dolarhyde, who kidnaps Lounds, glues him to an antique wheelchair, intimidates him into recanting his article on tape, and then bites his lips off. Dolarhyde then sets Lounds on fire and rolls him down an incline into \"The Tattler\"s parking garage.\n\nMeanwhile, Dolarhyde falls in love with a blind co-worker named Reba McClane. The relationship initially quells his murderous impulses, but her presence only infuriates the other part of Dolarhyde's psyche. Desperate now to retain control of himself, Dolarhyde flies to New York, where he goes to see the original Blake watercolor at the Brooklyn Museum and devours it, believing that doing so would destroy the Dragon. This plan fails, though, as his ingestion of the painting only makes the Dragon angrier. In a final effort to save McClane, Dolarhyde attempts to kill himself in a motel bathroom by hanging himself from the shower rod, but the noose breaks before he can successfully suffocate.\n\nThe FBI and police investigations have so far found little result as the next full moon, and murders, is approaching. Trace evidence has led to dead ends, the killer's partial fingerprint has no match on file, and authorities can find no connection between the families. Eventually Graham realizes that the killer must have had access to the families' home movies, using details from the film to plan entry to the family homes. Both families' film was processed at the same facility. From this fact, police eventually narrow down on Dolarhyde as the suspect.\n\nNow completely under the thrall of the Dragon and aware of the investigation closing in on him, Dolarhyde plans to kill McClane and himself by setting his house on fire with her in it. He relents at the last minute, however, and frees her. Hearing a shotgun blast, McClane feels around Dolarhyde's burning living room and discovers what appears to be his dead body, which is incinerated in the subsequent blaze. However, Dolarhyde actually shot the corpse of a gas station attendant who had earlier offended him by leering at McClane, and whom he had kidnapped in order to stage his own disappearance. Police rescue McClane from the burning house.\n\nBased on McClane's testimony and the male corpse in his house with the face ruined by a shotgun blast, he is believed to have killed himself. However, analysis eventually reveals that the corpse's fingerprints don't match prints at the crime scenes. Dolarhyde travels to Graham's home in Florida, attacks Graham and stabs him in the face. Graham's wife Molly intercepts Dolarhyde, however, and shoots him dead.\n\nDolarhyde has been twice portrayed in film adaptations of Harris' novel: by Tom Noonan in 1986's \"Manhunter\" (in which he was called \"Dollarhyde\") and by Ralph Fiennes in 2002's \"Red Dragon\".\n\nIn deleted scenes in \"Red Dragon\", Dolarhyde's Great Red Dragon personality is voiced by Frank Langella.\n\nOn January 13, 2015, Richard Armitage was cast as Dolarhyde and appeared in season 3 of the television series \"Hannibal\", beginning in episode 8, \"The Great Red Dragon\". Dolarhyde was referenced in the series premiere as the unseen murderer of the Marlowe family.\n\nIn this continuity, Dolarhyde and Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) communicate directly by telephone, and Dolarhyde's inner discussions with the Dragon are instead depicted as therapy sessions with Lecter. In the series finale, \"The Wrath of the Lamb\", Lecter and Graham (Hugh Dancy) kill Dolarhyde together; Graham stabs him, while Lecter bites his throat out.\n\nHarris loosely based Francis Dolarhyde on the then-unidentified serial killer known as \"BTK\" (Bind, Torture, Kill), who at the time of the book's publication was terrorizing Kansas with a series of murders, beginning with the murder of an entire family in their own home. Like Dolarhyde, BTK engaged in necrophiliac acts with his victims' bodies; he also wrote letters to the police alluding to an abusive childhood and being under the control of an outside influence, which he referred to as \"Factor X\". Harris had consulted with FBI Agent John E. Douglas prior to writing the book, and Douglas had served as a consultant on the BTK case for Kansas police. Harris was so impressed with Douglas that he borrowed aspects of his life story and personality for Will Graham and Jack Crawford.\n"}

{"id": "1833824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833824", "title": "Greg Ostertag", "text": "Greg Ostertag\n\nGregory Donovan Ostertag (born March 6, 1973) is an American retired professional basketball player. He spent most of his career with the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played in college at the University of Ohio.\n\nOstertag starred at Duncanville High School in Duncanville, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. He averaged 22.5 points and 13 rebounds per game during his senior season, and capped the year by leading the Panthers to the 1991 state championship, the first-ever for the school's boys basketball team.\n\nAfter his successful high school career, Ostertag joined the basketball team at the University of Kansas. Standing 7-foot-2 and weighing 280 pounds, Ostertag provided a strong presence in the paint, helping the Jayhawks reach the NCAA Final Four in 1993. Statistically, his best season was his junior year (1993–94), when he averaged 10.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. Most impressive, he set a school record by blocking 97 shots that year. He graduated in 1995 with career totals of 968 points and 770 rebounds, along with 258 blocked shots – the highest total in the history of Kansas and the Big 8 Conference at that time (since surpassed by Jeff Withey).\n\nThe Utah Jazz selected Ostertag with the 28th pick in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft. The Jazz hoped he could fill a void in the team's defense created by the retirement of Mark Eaton a few seasons earlier. Ostertag saw limited action in his rookie year, but emerged as Utah's starting center during his second season. The Jazz made back-to-back appearances in the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, with Ostertag providing strong defense in the playoffs against the likes of Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Tim Duncan, and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nEnvisioning him as a potentially dominant defender in the future, the Jazz signed Ostertag to a long-term contract extension worth $39 million over six years. However, throughout the remainder of his career, Ostertag struggled with poor physical conditioning and inconsistent play, much to the chagrin of his coaches and teammates. Also, he constantly frustrated Jazz fans with his clumsiness and lack of skill on offense. \nNevertheless, Ostertag made valuable contributions to the team on the defensive side of the floor, providing size and intimidation in the paint. He never played full starter-level minutes, thus hindering his overall statistical totals, but he was one of the most efficient shot-blockers in the league during his career. He led the NBA in blocked shot percentage twice (in 2000 and 2002) and was particularly good at gaining possession of the ball after blocking a shot.\n\nOstertag's contract expired in 2004, making him a free agent in the league. After nine seasons in Utah, he joined the Sacramento Kings. He played one year in Sacramento, before the Kings sent him back to Utah in a \"mega-trade\" that involved five teams and 13 players—the largest trade in NBA history. Ostertag played one final season (2005-06) with the Jazz, seeing limited action. He played his final game on April 19—a home contest against the Golden State Warriors. Having previously announced his retirement, and that game being the last of the season, Ostertag received a standing ovation from Jazz fans. He played 3:36 in the game, all in the first quarter. Fittingly, he blocked a shot and grabbed a rebound—and missed two free throws. The Jazz won the game, giving the team a final record of 41-41 for the year, ensuring that Ostertag retired having never played for a losing team for his entire NBA career.\n\nIn December 2011, Ostertag returned to professional basketball. He signed with the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League. However, after playing 10 games with the Legends, he ended his comeback due to knee injury.\n\nIn 2002, he donated a kidney to save the life of his sister Amy (Hall) Ostertag, who was dying of kidney disease; upon his return he became the first player in NBA history to play after donating an organ. He has since been an advocate of organ donation. \n\nOstertag lives on a small cattle farm in Mount Vernon, Texas with his wife Shannon. Together they have one child, daughter Charlestynn (born in 2013). Ostertag also has three children from a previous marriage, son Cody (born in 1993), daughter Bailey (born in 1997), and daughter Shelby (born in 1999).\n\nIn 2014, a prominent Los Angeles based street-artist, Ostertag, began using Ostertag's name to promote his art.\n\nOstertag is the co-founder of The Ostertag Group, an umbrella company that owns and operates ML Edwards & Co, Watermelon Mills Coffeehouse, and Ostertag Construction. \n\n\n"}

His compositions are inspired by American Indian history and culture.\n\nHe has had several commissioned works, which have been performed by major orchestras in Washington, DC; San Francisco, Detroit, and Minneapolis, among others. When the San Francisco Symphony Chorus performed and recorded his work \"Iholba' \" in 2008, it was the first time the chorus had sung any work in Chickasaw or any American Indian language.\n\nTate has also worked to develop younger musicians and composers. He is founder and artistic director of the Chickasaw Chamber Music Festival. He was Co-Founder and Composition Instructor for the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy. He has served as composer-in-residence. Since 2011 he has been an adjunct instructor on the music faculty of Oklahoma City University.\n\nJerod Sheffer Impichchaachaaha' Tate was born in 1968 in Norman, Oklahoma, and is a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation. With both parents involved in music, theatre and dance, he grew up immersed in classical music. His Chickasaw father, Charles Tate, is a classically trained pianist and baritone, who played at home as well as in professional performance. Through his paternal grandmother, Jerod Tate is part of the Shawi clan. His mother, Dr. Patricia Tate, is of Manx Irish descent. She was a professor of dance and a choreographer. His parents recognized and nurtured Jerod's musical talent. His parents were influential in encouraging his work in music, and by accompanying his father to tribal events, Jerod heard much American Indian music among the peoples of Oklahoma.\n\nHis Chickasaw middle name, \"Impichchaachaaha’\", means “high corncrib.” It is his inherited traditional Chickasaw house name, traditionally used in a manner similar to a European-American surname. A corncrib is a small hut used for the storage of corn and other vegetables. In traditional Chickasaw culture, the corncrib was built high off of the ground on stilts to keep its contents safe from foraging animals.\n\nTate received his BM in Piano Performance from Northwestern University, where he studied with Dr. Donald J. Isaak. He received his MM in Piano Performance and Composition from the Cleveland Institute of Music, where he studied with Elizabeth Pastor and Dr. Donald Erb.\n\nShortly before he began his piano studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music, his mother Dr. Patricia Tate commissioned his first composition, asking him for a ballet score. He wrote \"Winter Moons,\" exploring traditions of the tribes from the Northern Plains and Rockies, which premiered at the University of Wyoming in 1992. He found this was a way to combine American Indian tradition and classical training. The Colorado Ballet subsequently performed this ballet in 1994 and 1996.\n\nTate later commented about the experience of composing this work: \"I didn't mix my identities of being a classically trained musician and being an American Indian. I never saw that there was even a possible relationship between those two until I started composing. And that's when they came together in a way that made me feel just wonderful.\" After this, he returned to the Cleveland Institute of Music and initiated his second major, in composition, in addition to piano studies. He also worked with his father and others to study Chickasaw music more deeply.\n\nTate has said an important influence was Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, ”the first ethnomusicologist that was aware of his own folk music; he did it so naturally and so joyfully that I felt the same impulse to do the same thing from where I come from.”\n\nIn 1994 Dr. Bill Burkhardt held a convention in Boulder, Colorado about and with American Indian composers, who have highlight their innovations in working with traditional instruments and forms within classical music structure. The American Composers Forum, based in Minneapolis and working to support the composition of new music, implemented the First Nations Composers Initiative (FNCI). FNCI has commissioned several works from North American Indian composers. FNCI is no longer active. The American Composers Forum itself has commissioned three large-scale works from Tate.\n\nHis works have been commissioned and performed by the National Symphony Orchestra, The San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus, The Detroit Symphony, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra, Colorado Ballet, Canterbury Choral Society, among others. Tate has said that he works with \"sound icons,\" comparing his use of traditional flutes and drums, to the way that visual artists explore iconic images associated with American Indians: feathers, horses, etc.\n\nIn 2007 the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus performed and recorded his \"Tracing Mississippi\" and \"Iholba',\" released together in 2008. This was the first time the chorus had sung any work in Chickasaw or in any American Indian language. Tate said they took on the challenge just like learning how to sing in any other language.\n\nTate worked with the noted musician, R. Carlos Nakai, composing \"À Bec Quintet\" (2009), a woodwind quintet for him. Nakai premiered it at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.\n\nIn a program on American Indian classical music and composers, NPR noted that some tribes have funded education programs and other initiatives for young composers. Tate is among musicians who have developed institutions for the performance and composition of music by American Indians. He is founder and artistic director of the Chickasaw Chamber Music Festival. He was Co-Founder and Composition Instructor for the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy.\n\nIn 2009, Tate conceived, coordinated and implemented the CD project \"Oshtali: Music for String Quartet.\" The album consists of original compositions by his students from the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy; it is the first professional recording in history of works by young American Indian composers. A second CD recording from the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy, entitled \"Tobachi,\" was released in 2013. The third CD recording, entitled \"Taloowa' Chokma'si\"', was released in 2016. All three recordings were recorded, produced and released on the Grammy Award-winning label, Azica Records.\n\nHe has also served as composer-in-residence. In 1997, Tate was Composer-in-Residence for the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts/National Symphony Orchestra American Residency Program in the state of Wyoming. In 2004 and 2005, Tate was Composer-in-Residence for the Grand Canyon Music Festival’s Native American Composer Apprentice Project. In 2007, he was Composer-in-Residence for The Joyce Foundation/American Composers Forum, teaching composition to American Indian high school students in Minneapolis. In 2011 Tate was selected as Composer-Mentor of the 2012 Essentially Choral program supported by the Jerome Foundation.\n\nIn 2011 Tate joined the Bass School of Music at Oklahoma City University as an adjunct instructor of orchestration.\n\nIn reviewing a performance of \"Iholba’ (The Vision), for Solo Flute, Orchestra and Chorus,\" which was commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra and premiered at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, \"The Washington Post\" said, “Tate’s connection to nature and the human experience was quite apparent in this piece...rarer still is his ability to effectively infuse classical music with American Indian nationalism.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His great-great grandfather was the third Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn of Lubavitch.\n\nIn 1900, Levi Yitzchak married Chana Yanovski, whose father, Rabbi , was the Rabbi of the Ukrainian city of Nikolaiev. In 1902, their eldest son, Menachem Mendel was born. He was later to become the Rebbe of Lubavitch.\n\nSchneerson lived in Nikolaiev until 1909, when he was appointed to serve as the Rabbi of Yekatrinoslav. In 1939 he was arrested by the communist regime for his fearless stance against the Party's efforts to eradicate Jewish learning and practice in the Soviet Union, and particularly for distributing Matzah to the Jews of Yekatrinoslav. After more than a year of torture and interrogations in Stalin's prisons, he was sentenced to exile to a remote village Chiali in Kazakhstan. Shortly before his death, Levi Yitzchak was able to move to Almaty, where he was warmly welcomed by the small Lubavitcher community. There he died on the 20th of Av, 5704 (1944). Rabbi Levi Yitzchak was buried at a cemetery in Almaty. A Chabad Lubavitch synagogue named in his honour has been built near his gravesite.\n\nSchneerson was a distinguished Kabbalist.

She was an advanced Irish nationalist, whose career mirrored that of her husband, James Michael 'Citizen' Flanagan and her friend Constance Markievicz. She was a member of the radical women's group Inghinidhe na hÉireann (which in English would mean Daughters of Ireland) and the Irish Volunteers women's auxiliary Cumann na mBan.\n\nMary Perolz was born at Limerick on 7 May 1874, the third child of Richard Perolz and Bridget Carter. Her father and great-grandfather were printers by trade, which informed her literary career.\n\nShe joined Inghinidhe na hÉireann at its foundation in 1900. She was a member of the Provisional Committee led by Maud Gonne and later Constance Markievicz, and whose members included the Gifford sisters and Helena Molony. She introduced other women such members of her extended family like Rose McNamara to the organisation. She was frequently involved in the theatre, and acted the first ever play in Irish staged publicly in Dublin, playing Meadda in December 1902 in \"Eillis agus an Bhean Deirce\" \"(Ellis and the Beggar Woman)\" by playwright Peadar Toner Mac Fhionnlaoich, better known under his pseudonym, Cú Uladh.\n\nPerolz, as her friends called her, taught Irish history and language in classes organised by Inghinidhe na hÉireann for Dublin schoolchildren, conducted by lantern light at night. Marie and Helena Molony were stalwarts of the Liberty Players and National Players with the young actor Captain Sean Connolly, who would die in the Easter Rising.\n\nBy 1916, Perolz was a committed revolutionary, having joined Cumann na mBan and the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, of which her friend Constance Markievicz was a leading officer. She was a friend of James Connolly and in contact with Jim Larkin, the leaders of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. She worked for the Irish Women Workers' Union (IWWU), and attended Trade Union Congress meetings at Sligo on its behalf.\n\nPerolz was registered at the official owner of \"Spark\", a weekly socialist newspaper published between February 1915 and April 1916, edited by Markievicz. At an important public meeting in March 1916, she spoke as Markievicz, who was banned under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 from making appearances. Perolz read the text of Markievicz's speech and read the exclusion order imposed, and answered the questions of the audience.\n\nDuring the Easter Rising Perolz took a vital message from Padraic Pearse to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Tipperary calling out the troops, and also arranged six other people to carry the same message around the country. As she cycled through Cork she met Tomás Mac Curtain and Terence MacSwiney in their broken-down car, on their way to inform volunteers that the Rising was cancelled. On the flyleaf of a pocket book, she was carrying was written the secret message from Pearse: \"We go into action at noon today. PHP.\" The initialled notepaper took Mac Curtain and MacSwiney by surprise, as they had expected orders to be signed rather than initialled. She got back to Dublin by Wednesday of Easter Week.\n\nAfter the Rising Perolz hid out in Tralee, but she was betrayed and arrested on 2 May 1916, and brought to Dublin Castle under escort and imprisoned at Mountjoy Jail. The charge against her was her 'ownership' of James Connolly's \"Spark\", 'the seditious weekly paper'. Sedition was a felonious crime, equivalent to treason, and could carry the death penalty. On 5 June, General Maxwell was still awaiting orders for her deportation to England. Constance Markievicz, detained under Defence of the Realm Regulation 14B, was sent to Oxford Jail. Kathleen Lynn was sent to Bath women's prison. James Connolly's secretary Winifred Carney went with Marie, Helena Molony, Brighid Foley, and Ellen Ryan to Aylesbury Prison. From an initial tally of 73 arrests, these were the only women imprisoned in England after the Rising. They finally left Dublin on 20 June 1916. Perolz was sent to serve a sentence at Lewes Prison.\n\nOn their arrival in England, the women were given seven days to appeal against the sentences. The appeals were sent to a judge in the British High Court in London.\n\nPerolz' arrest scandalised her family; several resolved to change their surname to 'Prole', to disassociate themselves from her. After questions in the British parliament and a court appearance, Perolz and Breda Foley were released in July 1916. They were issued with travel warrants and expected to use them to go home to Ireland, landing at Dún Laoghaire. Immediately she was made Acting President of the Irish Women Workers' Union in Markievicz's stead. She travelled to England to greet her friend on her release from Aylesbury Prison on 17 June 1917, and accompanied her back to Ireland.\n\nPerolz and James Michael Flanagan, a leftist affectionately known as 'Citizen Flanagan', fell in love in 1919 and moved to live at 127 Botanic Road, Glasnevin, Dublin. She continued to work for women's rights in the labour movement. They married in 1919. She died on 12 December 1950.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "311092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311092", "title": "Paul Kurtz", "text": "Paul Kurtz\n\nPaul Kurtz (December 21, 1925 – October 20, 2012) was a prominent American scientific skeptic and secular humanist. He has been called \"the father of secular humanism\". He was Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, having previously also taught at Vassar, Trinity, and Union colleges, and the New School for Social Research.\n\nKurtz founded the publishing house Prometheus Books in 1969. He was also the founder and past chairman of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI, formerly the \"Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal\", CSICOP), the Council for Secular Humanism, and the Center for Inquiry. He was editor in chief of \"Free Inquiry\" magazine, a publication of the Council for Secular Humanism.\n\nHe was co-chair of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) from 1986 to 1994. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Humanist Laureate, president of the International Academy of Humanism and Honorary Associate of Rationalist International. As a member of the American Humanist Association, he contributed to the writing of Humanist Manifesto II. He was an editor of \"The Humanist\", 1967–78.\n\nKurtz published over 800 articles or reviews and authored and edited over 50 books. Many of his books have been translated into over 60 languages.\n\nKurtz was born in Newark, New Jersey, into a Jewish family, the son of Sara Lasser and Martin Kurtz. Kurtz received his bachelor's degree from New York University, and the Master's degree and Doctor of Philosophy degree from Columbia University. Kurtz was left-wing in his youth, but has said that serving in the United States Army in World War II taught him the dangers of ideology. He saw the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps after they were liberated, and became disillusioned with Communism when he encountered Russian slave laborers who had been taken to Nazi Germany by force but refused to return to the Soviet Union at the end of the war.\n\nKurtz was largely responsible for the secularization of humanism. Before Kurtz embraced the term \"secular humanism,\" which had received wide publicity through fundamentalist Christians in the 1980s, humanism was more widely perceived as a religion (or a pseudoreligion) that did not include the supernatural. This can be seen in the first article of the original Humanist Manifesto which refers to \"Religious Humanists\" and by Charles and Clara Potter's influential 1930 book \"Humanism: A New Religion\".\n\nKurtz used the publicity generated by fundamentalist preachers to grow the membership of the Council for Secular Humanism, as well as strip the religious aspects found in the earlier humanist movement. He founded the Center for Inquiry in 1991. There are now some 40 Centers and Communities worldwide, including in Los Angeles, Washington, New York City, London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Moscow, Beijing, Hyderabad, Toronto, Dakar, Buenos Aires and Kathmandu.\n\nIn 1999 Kurtz was given the International Humanist Award by the International Humanist and Ethical Union. He had been a board member of IHEU between 1969 and 1994, and in a tribute by former colleague at both IHEU and the Council for Secular Humanism Matt Cherry, Kurtz was described as having \"had a strong commitment to international humanism – a commitment to humanism beyond US borders never seen matched by another American. He did a lot to expand IHEU as a member of the IHEU Growth and Development Committee (with Levi Fragell and Rob Tielman) and then when he was co-chair, also with Rob and Levi. He always pushed IHEU to be bigger and bolder.\"\n\nIn 2000 he received the International Rationalist Award by Rationalist International. In 2001, he debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig over the nature of morality.\n\nKurtz believed that the nonreligious members of the community should take a positive view on life. Religious skepticism, according to Paul Kurtz, is only one aspect of the secular humanistic outlook. In an interview with D.J. Grothe, he stated that a categorical imperative of secular humanism is \"genuine concern for the well-being of other humans.\"\n\nAt the Council of Secular Humanism's Los Angeles conference (7–10 October 2010), tension over the future of humanism was on display as Kurtz urged a more accommodationist approach to religion while his successors argued for a more adversarial approach.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, he resigned from all these positions. Moreover, the Center for Inquiry accepted his resignation as chairman emeritus, board member, and as editor in chief of \"Free Inquiry\" as being the culmination of a years-long \"leadership transition\", thanking him \"for his decades of service\" while also alluding to \"concerns about Dr. Kurtz's day-to-day management of the organization\". Kurtz renewed his efforts in organized humanism by founding The Institute for Science and Human Values and its journal \"The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective\" in June 2010.\n\nAnother aspect in Kurtz's legacy is his critique of the paranormal. In 1976, CSICOP started \"Skeptical Inquirer\", its official journal. Like Martin Gardner, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, James Randi, Ray Hyman and others, Kurtz has popularized scientific skepticism and critical thinking about claims of the paranormal.\n\nConcerning the founding of the modern skeptical movement, Ray Hyman states that in 1972, he, along with James Randi and Martin Gardner, wanted to form a skeptical group called S.I.R. (Sanity In Research). The three of them felt they had no administration experience, saying \"we just had good ideas\", and were soon joined by Marcello Truzzi who provided structure for the group. Truzzi involved Paul Kurtz and they together formed CSICOP in 1976.\n\nKurtz wrote:\n\n[An] explanation for the persistence of the paranormal, I submit, is due to the transcendental temptation. In my book by that name, I present the thesis that paranormal and religious phenomena have similar functions in human experience; they are expressions of a tendency to accept magical thinking. This temptation has such profound roots within human experience and culture that it constantly reasserts itself.\n\nIn \"The Transcendental Temptation\", Kurtz analyzes how provable are the claims of Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad, as well as the founders of religions on American soil such as Joseph Smith and Ellen White. He also evaluates the activities of the most famous modern psychics and what he believes are the fruitless researches of parapsychologists. \"The Transcendental Temptation\" is considered among Kurtz's most influential writings.\n\nHe promoted what he called \"Skepticism of the Third Kind,\" in which skeptics actively investigate claims of the paranormal, rather than just question them. He saw this type of skepticism as distinct from the \"first kind\" of extreme philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility that anything can be known, as well as the \"second kind\" of skepticism, which accepts that knowledge of the real world is possible but is still largely a philosophical exercise.\n\nOn 19 April 2007, Kurtz appeared on Penn & Teller's television show \"\" arguing that exorcism and Satanic cults are merely \"hype and paranoia\".\n\nKurtz coined the term eupraxsophy (originally \"eupraxophy\") to refer to philosophies or life stances such as secular humanism and Confucianism that do not rely on belief in the transcendent or supernatural. A \"eupraxsophy\" is a nonreligious life stance or worldview emphasizing the importance of living an ethical and exuberant life, and relying on rational methods such as logic, observation and science (rather than faith, mysticism or revelation) toward that end. The word is based on the Greek words for \"good\", \"practice\", and \"wisdom\". Eupraxsophies, like religions, are cosmic in their outlook but eschew the supernatural component of religion, avoiding the \"transcendental temptation,\" as Kurtz puts it. Although critical of supernatural religion, he has attempted to develop affirmative ethical values of naturalistic humanism.\n\nIn June 2010, the State University of New York at Buffalo announced the establishment of the Paul Kurtz Lecture Series. The series will bring notable speakers to the University's campus in Amherst, New York, to speak on topics relevant to the philosophy of humanism and philosophical naturalism. Kurtz had made the bequest and charitable gift annuity to the University, where he taught from 1965 to 1991, to help promote the development of critical intelligence in future generations of SUNY at Buffalo students. On November 5, 2010, the University announced that cognitive scientist Steven Pinker would inaugurate the new Paul Kurtz Lecture Series on December 2, 2010.\n\nPaul Kurtz conceived of the \"Institute for Science and Human Values\" in 2009 as yet another branch of the umbrella group, the Center for Inquiry. Upon his resignation from the Center for Inquiry he launched the Institute for Science and Human Values as a separate entity. In ISHV's first press release Kurtz said ISHV hoped to \"rehumanize secularism\" and \"find out how to better develop the common moral virtues that we share as human beings.\" Kurtz was editor-in-chief of ISHV's journal, \"The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective\".\n\nThe asteroid 6629 Kurtz was named in his honor.\n\nAt a meeting of the executive council of CSI in Denver, Colorado in April 2011, Kurtz was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "169218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169218", "title": "Paul Oakenfold", "text": "Paul Oakenfold\n\nPaul Mark Oakenfold (born 30 August 1963), formerly known mononymously as Oakenfold, is an English record producer and trance DJ. He is a three-time Grammy Award and two-time World Music Awards nominee. He was voted the No. 1 DJ in the World twice in 1998 and 1999 by \"DJ Magazine\". Oakenfold has provided over 100 remixes for over 100 artists including U2, Moby, Madonna, Britney Spears, Massive Attack, The Cure, New Order, The Rolling Stones and The Stone Roses.\n\nOakenfold was born 30 August 1963 at Mile End Hospital. His father delivered the London Evening News. He lived in Highbury, Greenhithe, then Croydon, attending Archbishop Lanfranc School, then studied to be a chef for four years and worked at the Army and Navy Club.\n\nPaul Oakenfold describes his early life as a \"bedroom DJ\" in a podcasted interview with Vancouver's \"24 Hours\", stating he grew up listening to The Beatles.\n\nOakenfold's musical career began in the late 1970s, when he met Trevor Fung and \nbegan helping him DJ soul music in a Covent Garden wine bar. Here in London, he also met Rumours where he played Earth, Wind and Fire and popular British bands.\n\nIn 1981, 18-year-old Oakenfold and his friend Ian Paul moved to New York City. Oakenfold worked as a courier in West Harlem. During this time, hip-hop was overtaking dance music as the most popular sound in the area (see 1984 in music). Oakenfold and Paul used fake identification to sneak into various dance clubs, like Studio 54, where they met members of the band Maze, Bobby Womack and Bob Marley, whom they also interviewed, claiming to be \"NME\" and \"Melody Maker\" journalists.\n\nReturning to London, Oakenfold began breaking into the mainstream, as an A&R man for Champion Records. At that time, he signed DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, as well as Salt-n-Pepa. Oakenfold appeared on the \"Blue Peter\" BBC programme for children with a breakdancing crew. He became a promoter and British agent for the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.. Since then, he appeared at The Project in Streatham playing soul and jazz music.\n\nIn 1987, Oakenfold travelled to the island of Ibiza for a week to celebrate his birthday. Trevor Fung, Nicky Holloway, Ian Saint Paul, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker accompanied him. Oakenfold convinced the owner of a venue in England to host an \"Ibiza Reunion\" party after-hours. He had previously made an attempt, but it failed as the crowd was not prepared for the acid house style until 1987 when the party was successful. After that, the night became a classic and became one of the UK's major acid house nights, known as \"Spectrum\" at Heaven (nightclub) in Charing Cross. The party was best known for the \"Theatre of Madness\", as more than 1,500 people were present on Monday nights, until it went down; with the financial issues it changed its name to the \"Land of Oz\". Artists like Alex Paterson DJ'd in the VIP chillout area known as the \"White Room\", which gave Oakenfold more free time, and then he began producing music under the alias \"Electra\" in 1988. Members included Nick Divaris, John \"Johnny\" Rocca and Micky. Also in 1988 he decided to create a place where new artists could develop their careers. At that moment, Perfecto Records was born.\n\nHe collaborated with his friend Steve Osborne on various projects. In 1990, he worked with Terry Farley, Andrew Weatherall and Osborne on two remixes for Happy Mondays. The remixes of \"Rave On\" and \"Hallelujah\" were released on the \"Madchester Rave On\" EP, as well as \"Step On\", a covered version adapted from John Kongos' 1971 hit \"He's Gonna Step On You\". The song reached the Top 5 position in the UK. He was invited as a guest DJ to Spike Island, a gig with The Stone Roses. Pleased with the last single, the Happy Mondays gave Oakenfold and Osborne the opportunity to produce their third studio album, \"Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches\". The album entered the UK charts at #1 with pre-sales of 150,000. The album was named NME's \"1990 Album of The Year\", and both Oakenfold and Osborne won the 1991 Brit Award for \"Best Producer\".\n\nAs they continued releasing only four singles as Electra, in Full Frequency Range Recordings (FFRR) founded and run by Radio 1's Pete Tong, the duo created a new alias under the name Perfecto. They remixed Massive Attack's \"Safe From Harm\" as well as many others. Grace was formed in the late 1990s, consisting of Oakenfold and Osborne and various singers, including jazz singer Dominique Atkins and Patti Low.\n\nIn 1992, when U2 released their song \"Even Better Than the Real Thing\", the Perfecto remix reached a higher charted position than the original song. In 1993 with the success of his last remix as Perfecto, he was hired by U2 to provide the warm-up sonics to their Zoo TV world tour, and replaced BP Fallon on the 1993 legs in Europe and Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, with more than fifty shows in Zooropa '93 and Zoomerang from 7 May to 10 December of the same year.\nIn September 1994 and again in 1998 he teamed up with Steve Osborne and Ben Hillier to remix the Rolling Stones's song You Got Me Rocking and Duran Duran's song Out Of My Mind. He began producing his own tracks as well, continuing to remix songs from popular artists. He began using Goa music, something he discovered on the beaches of Goa in India, fusing it with similar-sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound. He took this to the mainstream in 1994 and created a pair of two-hour sets for BBC Radio 1's \"Essential Mix\" the first of these was broadcast in the early hours of Sunday 20 March 1994, with the second being the legendary \"Goa Mix\" broadcast on Sunday 18 December 1994. In 1995, he became the first DJ to play on the main stage at the Glastonbury Festival for 90,000 people, which he considers his favorite gig. His album \"Perfecto Fluoro\" became the #1 essential dance collection of Boston Beat during 1996 with Jamiroquai's \"Travelling Without Moving\". The group Grace dissolved in 1997 as Oakenfold was touring as a performance DJ more frequently and could not commit to recording.\n\nOn 9 June 1997 Oakenfold created \"Global Underground 004: Paul Oakenfold, Live in Oslo\" (GU004) which is a double mix CD in the Global Underground series, compiled and mixed by Oakenfold; it is the first work he created for GU. The mix was recorded live at Cosmopolite Club in Oslo, Norway, as part of the official launch of the Quart Festival. It showcases Oakenfold's eclectic taste in music at the time, as the mix combines various forms of dance music. In 1997, Oakenfold mixed one disc of the double album \"Fantazia Presents the House Collection 6\", a UK house music compilation series. Oakenfold became Cream's resident DJ from 1997 – 1999. During this time, he began to concentrate on the release of \"Tranceport\" in 1998.\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, Oakenfold took the first place in \"DJmag's Top 100 DJs\". With the two-year contract as a resident in Liverpool's Cream, it was in 1999 that he released \"Resident. Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream.\" on Virgin. Thrive Records, the US distributor for early Global Underground releases had a different numbering scheme for the Global Underground albums, due to this \"Global Underground 007: Paul Oakenfold, New York\" (GU007) was released as (GU002) in the United States only. The compilation was released on 25 May 1998, with the US release on 19 January 1999. This was the second production from Oakenfold with GU and it contained trance, drum and bass, progressive house, progressive trance, breakbeat and Downtempo. This became his last work with GU.\n\nIn 1999, he moved to the United States where he went on tour.\n\nIn 2000, he created fourteen tracks of jazz, soul, house and goa based styles with Mitchell Oakenfold. Twenty-four \"FX and scratches\" loops and sounds were included too, each consisting of six seconds; the album cover says \"Only for DJs and Producers\" and was released on Music of Life.\n\nIn March 2000 he teamed up with Steve Osborne, Andy Gray and Bruno Ellingham to remix Moby's song Natural Blues. He produced a Trance remix.\n\nSometime before July 2000, he teamed up with Andy Gray to write and produce the theme for the Channel 4 reality show \"Big Brother\" under the name Elementfour. The series started airing on 18 July 2000. The programme and theme have since moved over to Channel 5 since 18 August 2011.\n\nIn September 2000 he opened the new Digital Radio station Ministry of Sound Radio with a live mix from the famous London club.\n\nOakenfold appeared in the intro scene of EA's Euro 2000 video game, which featured him using his turntables to activate the video game and control various players.\n\nAfter his success in Europe, one of Oakenfold's first major events in America was Fresno, California's Cyberfest on 22 July 2000. The 500 acre indoor and outdoor central California location had the biggest dance capacity ever in America. An estimated 80,000 dancers and music lovers from Seattle, Reno, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego were welcomed that day. Cyberfest 2000, also known as the \"Festival Of The Future\" featured other DJs such as Chemical Brothers, BT, and Carl Cox. Cyberfest 2000 paved the way for other major events in the area such as the Electric Daisy Carnival in Los Angeles in 2010.\n\nIn 2001, Oakenfold took part in the first Area Festival tour. This tour featured Incubus, Carl Cox, The Orb, OutKast, and The Roots. He later released a new compilation album, \"Perfecto Presents: Ibiza\".\n\n2001 also saw the release of the video game \"Frequency\", for which Oakenfold produced one track, \"See It\".\n\nGlobal Underground sold over 150,000 copies of Oakenfold's previous \"Global Underground: New York\". A spokesperson for the label claimed that in the US, demand for UK dance music had been increasing in the past couple of years, and now made up over two-thirds of the label's sales. The Global Underground New York office opened in on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. The Mekka Electronic Music Festival, otherwise known as the \"electronic Lollapallooza\" took place in ten cities in the US and Canada during August and September, including New York City, Los Angeles, Toronto and San Francisco. The event featured Paul, Armand van Helden, De La Soul, LTJ Bukem, Josh Wink, Derrick Carter, Roni Size, Deep Dish, BT, The Crystal Method, Carl Craig and Überzone. Oakenfold next moved to Los Angeles to work on film soundtracks and to focus his DJing stateside. In 2001 he created the soundtrack for the film \"Swordfish\", \"Swordfish: The Album\" contained a transformation of \"Planet Rock\" into a seven-minute breakbeat trance anthem. Most of the tracks are collaborations with Andy Gray, the remix of N.E.R.D.'s \"Lapdance\" which gained total notability from other tracks. The soundtrack was produced under Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. and distributed through London-Sire Records.\n\nOakenfold recorded a track with Crazy Town vocalist Shifty Shellshock at the end of the year for his new album. In an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Shellshock said that the track known as \"Starry Eyed Surprise\" was created after the pair met at a Crazy Town show.\n\nIn 2002, \"Bunkka\" became his first official studio album when he signed to Maverick. The name \"Bunkka\" came from Peter Gabriel's studio in the UK, where the album was recorded. An extended play was released featuring live versions of four songs under Peoplesound Records. It is also Oakenfold's best selling album to date, with sales largely exceeding 1,000,000 (1 million) copies worldwide.\n\nThe album features vocals from Jane's Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell on \"Time of Your Life\" and Shifty Shellshock of Los Angeles rock and rap band Crazy Town on \"Starry Eyed Surprise\"; Ice Cube on \"Get Em Up\"; and Tricky and Nelly Furtado on \"The Harder They Come\". The album contains appearances by Asher D of So Solid Crew on \"Ready Steady Go\", and Grant-Lee Philips, founder of the 90's Los Angeles rock band Grant Lee Buffalo is also included with Carmen Rizzo's version of his song \"Motion\". Bunkka also provided the start to three new artists, Carla Werner on the smash single \"Southern Sun\", Tiff Lacey on \"Hypnotized\" and Emiliana Torrini on \"Hold Your Hand\". Hunter S. Thompson's spoken words are provided on \"Nixon's Spirit\". The world-renowned Pakistani musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's composition was adapted in an electronic version on the tracks \"Zoo York\".

Also in 2003 he remixed another hit soundtrack for 'Elvis Presley' which charted fairly well after his 2003 remix of \"Rubberneckin'\" made the top three in Australia and top five in the UK. This remix contributed to the Elvis of the 21st century. In an earlier episode, \"The Imposter\", of Radio Free Roscoe, a 2005 series on The N, a character Travis Strong DJed to the song, acting as if it were his own. It has more recently been used in the film adaptation () of Anthony Horowitz's novel Stormbreaker, The Bourne Identity and it was reproduced with Korean lyrics for the film \"Collateral\", the song has also been used during the performances of extreme freestyle water ski jumpers, the song later became the theme song for the TV Show TRL Italy since 2003 until 2005. An EP of \"The Harder They Come\" was released on Perfecto and featured other works from Oakenfold and other artists.

Receiving unsuccessful reviews, the first single \"Faster Kill Pussycat\", a collaboration with the actress Brittany Murphy, was released on 2 May 2006; the second single was \"Sex 'n' Money\". Both songs stand out from the rest, as most of the album has a more trance-like feel. Gregory Jeffries from AllMusic stated the album might have been in the nominated albums of dance music in 1997 but not in 2006, as the album has guitars with disco sounds that might be only appealing to trance addicts.\nIn 2007, he played live at the Boston Pops which created a piece of orchestral music with electronic music.

{"id": "8641484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8641484", "title": "Richard Alexander (exonerated convict)", "text": "Richard Alexander (exonerated convict)\n\nRichard Alexander is an Indiana man wrongfully convicted of rape and later exonerated by DNA evidence.\n\nIn 1996 a suspected serial rapist dubbed by local media the \"River Park Rapist\" preyed on female residents of South Bend, Indiana. Police arrested Richard Alexander (then 30 years old) in August 1996 for four of the rapes, largely on the basis of the statements of the victims.\n\nDNA evidence definitively excluded him as a suspect in one of the rapes, although both the victim and her fiancé continued to insist that Alexander was the perpetrator. Not all of the investigators were convinced of his guilt, particularly as three similar rapes occurred while Alexander was in police custody. In the case of one of the rapes that took place while he was in custody, Alexander's picture was accidentally placed in a photo-lineup shown to the victim. She selected his photograph as that of her assailant, despite his incarceration at the time of the offense.\n\nNevertheless, Alexander was prosecuted for the three rapes, with charges totaling two counts of robbery, two counts of criminal deviate conduct, two counts of attempted rape, confinement, attempted robbery, rape, burglary and auto theft. His 1997 trial ended in a hung jury, with two of the three black jurors voting with the nine white jurors for conviction. He was re-tried for the crimes in 1998 by an all-white jury. At the second trial, one of the victims, though identifying Alexander as her assailant, asserted that he had a hairless chest without tattoos. When it was demonstrated that Alexander had a hairy, heavily tattooed chest, he was acquitted of that rape. Nevertheless, he was convicted of the other two and was sentenced to seventy years in prison.\n\nIn 2001, with Alexander already having served five years in prison, an alleged burglar and child molester named Michael Murphy confessed to one of the two rapes of which Alexander had been convicted, knowing details only the true assailant would know. With this revelation, a judge ordered a new round of DNA testing in Alexander's case. Hairs found at the scene of the rape were submitted to mitochondrial DNA testing. At the time of Alexander's original conviction, such testing was not available in the state of Indiana. The tests proved that the DNA did not match Alexander's profile, but did match Murphy's.\n\nBecause of this new development, Indiana prosecutors came to believe that Alexander was in fact not responsible for any of the rapes. In the remaining rape for which he was incarcerated, the evidence against him consisted of the victim's tentative identification of his voice and an eyewitness's visual identification of Alexander. The Indiana prosecutor and Alexander's defense attorney filed a joint motion to have Alexander's convictions overturned.\n\nThe courts granted the motion, and Alexander was exonerated of all charges and released from prison on December 12, 2001. It is now believed that the River Park Rapist was actually two separate perpetrators.\n\nOn June 4, 2002, Richard Alexander filed a federal suit against the city of South Bend, its police department and 14 of its officers, including Sgt. Cindy Eastman, an officer instrumental in securing Alexander's release. His lawyer, Roseann P. Ivanovich, said she expected to ask for about $55 million in damages ($10 million for every year spent in prison). Among the allegations in the 48-page lawsuit:\n\n\nThe civil rights lawsuit was eventually dismissed by the United States district court, a decision which Alexander appealed. But on January 3, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of Alexander's lawsuit. The court stated that Alexander had not proven his rights were violated during the trial which yielded his wrongful conviction.\n\nOn May 22, 2007, Alexander pleaded guilty to one count of battery for having beaten a former girlfriend with a lead pipe in 2005. As part of his plea bargain, a second count of battery was dismissed.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, Alexander was sentenced to eight years in prison, with two years suspended.\n\n\n"}

Owens\n\nSergeant Robert Allen Owens (September 13, 1920 – November 1, 1943) was a United States Marine who was killed in action during World War II. He was posthumously awarded his nation's highest military award — the Medal of Honor — for his heroic actions on his first day in combat at Bougainville. The commanding general of the 3rd Marine Division described Owens' heroism — \"Among many brave acts on the beachhead of Bougainville, no other single act saved the lives of more of his comrades or served to contribute so much to the success of the landings.\"\n\nRobert Allen Owens was born in Greenville, South Carolina, on September 13, 1920. The family later moved to Spartanburg, which young Owens listed as his home town. After two years in high school, he went to work as a textile worker in a neighboring town. He worked at that for five years before his enlistment in the Marine Corps on February 10, 1942.\n\nIn 1942, Owens went through recruit training at Parris Island, South Carolina, and then Owens continued his training with the 1st Training Battalion of the 1st Marine Division, then located in New River, North Carolina. In June, the unit's designation was changed to Company A, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines, 3rd Marine Division. The Division left the South Pacific and the 3rd Marines' first overseas station at Tutuila, American Samoa, in September 1942. Later they went to New Zealand and Guadalcanal to train for their first combat assignment. After 21 months of training, Owens would see his first and only combat mission.\n\nOn November 1, 1943, the Marine amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, Bougainville, was strongly resisted by the sole piece of artillery available to the Japanese defenders, a well-camouflaged 75 millimeter regimental gun. Strategically placed and protected within a coconut log bunker, the gun had already destroyed four landing craft and damaged ten others, seriously threatening the success of the operation. No boats could approach the beach without passing within 150 yards or less from the muzzle. The emplacement was so situated that it could only be attacked from the front and also in a position whereby rifle fire and grenades could not reach the gun crew.\n\nSizing up the situation, Sgt Owens decided that the only way to neutralize the gun was to charge it directly from the front. Calling on four volunteers to assist him, he positioned them where they could place supporting bunkers under fire. At the moment when he judged he had a fair chance of reaching his objective, the six-feet-three, 232-pound Marine charged right into the very mouth of the still rapidly firing cannon. Entering the emplacement through the fire port, he chased the Japanese out the back where they were cut down by his rifleman. Pursuing them, he in turn was instantly killed.\n\nIt was discovered that a round had been placed in the chamber and the breech was almost closed at the moment that Sgt Owens came through the fire port. Over 150 rounds of high-explosive shells were stacked and ready for firing. The enemy had counted heavily on this weapon to stop the Marine landing. They made several determined but fruitless efforts to recapture the piece. Maj Gen Allen H. Turnage, Commanding General of the 3rd Marine Division, said, \"Among many brave acts on the beachhead of Bougainville, no other single act saved the lives of more of his comrades or served to contribute so much to the success of the landings.\"\n\nGeneral Alexander A. Vandegrift, then Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Maj Gen Turnage so strongly recommended the Medal of Honor for Sgt Owens, who had already received the Navy Cross posthumously, that the case was reviewed and the generals' recommendations were adopted. The medal was presented to the hero's father at his home in Drayton, South Carolina, on August 12, 1945, by Maj Gen Clayton B. Vogel, then Commanding General at Parris Island.\n\nInitially buried in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps Cemetery on Bougainville, Sgt Owens' remains were later reinterred in the Manila American Cemetery formally Fort McKinley U.S. Military Cemetery .\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to\n\nSERGEANT ROBERT A. OWENS\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with a marine division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during extremely hazardous landing operations at Cape Torokina, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, on 1 November 1943. Forced to pass within disastrous range of a strongly protected, well-camouflaged Japanese 75-mm. regimental gun strategically located on the beach, our landing units were suffering heavy losses in casualties and boats while attempting to approach the beach, and the success of the operations was seriously threatened. Observing the ineffectiveness of marine rifle and grenade attacks against the incessant, devastating fire of the enemy weapon and aware of the urgent need for prompt action, Sgt. Owens unhesitatingly determined to charge the gun bunker from the front and, calling on 4 of his comrades to assist him, carefully placed them to cover the fire of the 2 adjacent hostile bunkers. Choosing a moment that provided a fair opportunity for passing these bunkers, he immediately charged into the mouth of the steadily firing cannon and entered the emplacement through the fire port, driving the guncrew out of the rear door and insuring their destruction before he himself was wounded. Indomitable and aggressive in the face of almost certain death, Sgt. Owens silenced a powerful gun which was of inestimable value to the Japanese defense and, by his brilliant initiative and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, contributed immeasurably to the success of the vital landing operations. His valiant conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon himself and the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n/S/ HARRY S. TRUMAN\n\nThe , launched on January 28, 1948, a U.S. Navy Gearing class destroyer, was named in honor of Sgt Owens.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40192503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40192503", "title": "Sean Sasser", "text": "Sean Sasser\n\nSean Franklin Sasser (October 25, 1968 – August 7, 2013) was an American educator, pastry chef and reality television personality best known for his appearances on MTV's \"\", which depicted his relationship with fellow AIDS activist Pedro Zamora. Although not one of the original cast members himself, Sasser's relationship with Zamora was one of the focal points of that season. This included a commitment ceremony in which the two exchanged vows, the first such ceremony for a same sex couple on television, and considered a landmark event in the medium.\n\nSean Franklin Sasser was born on October 25, 1968 in Detroit, where he grew up. When he was six, his parents divorced, after which his father, an Army sergeant, was mostly absent from his life, sending a Casio watch to him every year on his birthday. (Years later his father called when Sasser was in Minneapolis, and left a message with Sasser's boyfriend, but left no number and did not call back.) Sasser's mother, Patricia Sasser, continued to raise Sasser and his younger sister. Sasser attended a private school, which he said was probably not typical of most African-American young people in urban Detroit. He later attended Cass Technical High School, a select college-preparatory magnet school. After high school, Sasser attended the University of Chicago to study Near Eastern civilizations and become an archeologist, commenting, \"I wanted to be one of the first major black archeologists to call the bluff on all this Egyptian stuff that was stolen by other cultures.\" However, he found himself bored and depressed, and barely completed his freshman year. Sasser dropped out of college, intending initially to take a year off. After he came out as gay to his devoutly religious mother (the daughter of a minister mother), he attempted to enlist in the United States Navy, explaining in a 1997 interview, \"I didn't want to be gay anymore. I thought it would work. You know, the discipline, all that stuff.\" Before he could leave his home, however, a mandatory blood test revealed that the 19-year-old Sasser was HIV-positive. He decided to enroll in culinary school, as he had always been fond of cooking, and wanted to open his own restaurant.\n\nAfter finishing school, Sasser found jobs cooking in local Chicago restaurants, but was too fixated on the idea of dying from AIDS. Realizing that he \"needed to figure out how to keep living\", he moved to San Francisco, whose greater HIV awareness and diversity allowed him to find people he more easily related to – specifically, HIV-positive people closer to his own age – which raised his spirits. Sasser joined a youth HIV-positive movement that advocated attention for adolescents with the disease, and began speaking to groups about his own experience with HIV. He subsequently assisted a support group called Bay Area Positives, for young people of color. He appeared in a number of videos on behalf of the group, including \"Not Me\", which aired on PBS. He was photographed by Annie Leibovitz for a national AIDS awareness campaign.\n\nSasser attended the 1993 Lesbian and Gay March on Washington, where he introduced himself to a fellow AIDS educator named Pedro Zamora. Although Sasser did not characterize his meeting Zamora as love at first sight (they were both involved with other people at the time), he was moved by Zamora's presence and conviction, recalling, \"I was kind of like, 'Wow.' I had never run across someone who was as good at it as he was.\" Sasser encouraged Zamora to call him if Zamora ever visited San Francisco. Sasser subsequently learned that producers of \"The Real World\" were looking for an HIV-positive person to cast in the 1994 season in San Francisco season, where Sasser had been living for a couple of years, and eventually learned that the person cast was Zamora, whom Sasser felt was ideal for the role.\n\nSasser had been living in San Francisco for a couple of years in the 1990s. When Zamora moved into \"The Real World\" San Francisco loft, he and Sasser began dating. Zamora asked the show's producers for permission to go out on the second date without cameras, so that he and Sasser could get to know one another in a more natural setting. After the producers allowed this, Sasser and Zamora fell in love, and their relationship became a focal point of the season. Their relationship met with the approval of Zamora's housemates and close friends, Judd Winick and Pam Ling, the latter of whom joked that Sasser and Zamora \"would become the mayors of Castro Street\". Winick adds that whereas Sasser was a private person who harbored the ability to pack up and leave town on short notice, Zamora's openness led them to discuss more permanent living arrangements as a couple. Sasser proposed to Zamora, and the two exchanged vows in a commitment ceremony in the loft, the first such ceremony for a same-sex couple in television history.\n\nAfter production on \"The Real World\" ceased in June 1994, Zamora visited his family in Miami before returning to San Francisco to live with Sasser. In August 1994, Zamora was diagnosed in New York City with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and was given three to four months to live. On September 3, Zamora was flown to Mercy Hospital in Miami, where his family could be close to him. His family was not accepting of Sasser, however, and because the PML gradually took away Zamora's ability to speak, Zamora was unable to explicitly communicate to them the importance of Sasser in his life. This led to confrontations between Sasser and the Zamoras, who told him that \"Pedro did not need to have a lover anymore\", and mostly excluded Sasser from Zamora during his final days. Zamora died on November 11, 1994. Sasser returned to San Francisco two days later. Six months after Zamora's death, he resumed his speaking engagements for LGBT and HIV issues. In 1995, he spoke at the inaugural White House AIDS conference, and was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. He moved to Atlanta in late 1995, in order to be with his boyfriend, and hoped to open a café.\n\nIn 2008 Bunim-Murray Productions produced a film, \"Pedro\", directed by Nick Oceano, dramatizing Zamora's life. In the film, Sasser is portrayed by DaJuan Johnson. Sasser took issue with the film's portrayal of his relationship with Zamora's family. In the film, after Zamora is hospitalized in Miami, his father and brothers initially refuse to accept Sasser as Zamora's spouse, telling Sasser that their time in San Francisco is over, and attempt to keep them apart. After Zamora objects to this, Zamora's family is made to watch the video of their commitment ceremony, and accept Sasser as Zamora's husband. Sasser, who regretted not having had an opportunity to spend more time with Zamora, says that this was not what occurred in reality, saying, \"I have a lot of resentment toward dealing with his family's homophobia, as well as dealing with him dying... It's troublesome. If there had been some sort of support behind our commitment ceremony... I had a hard time dealing with his family. With Pedro's death and being allowed in the hospital... I don't know. Maybe it could have helped the family deal with my presence, you know?\"\n\nSasser was a pastry chef at Ritz-Carlton hotel properties and head pastry chef at The Nines, a luxury hotel in Portland, Oregon. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 2012, where, as a pastry chef at a restaurant called RIS, he was praised by the \"Washington Blade\" for his homemade ice cream and sorbets. Sasser said of his work, \"I want to serve desserts and pastries that people recognize and love to eat, but sometimes with an unexpected twist of surprise.\"\n\nIn June 2013, Sasser married Michael Kaplan, whom he had dated off and on since the 1990s, and with whom he had moved in six years prior. While living in the District, Sasser served as a board member of the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families.

{"id": "4986168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4986168", "title": "Secret Chiefs", "text": "Secret Chiefs\n\nIn various occult movements, Secret Chiefs are said to be transcendent cosmic authorities, a Spiritual Hierarchy responsible for the operation and moral calibre of the cosmos, or for overseeing the operations of an esoteric organization that manifests outwardly in the form of a magical order or lodge system. Their names and descriptions have varied through time, dependent upon those who reflect their experience of contact with them. They are variously held to exist on higher planes of being or to be incarnate; if incarnate, they may be described as being gathered at some special location, such as Shambhala, or scattered through the world working anonymously.\n\nOne early and influential source on these entities is Karl von Eckartshausen, whose \"The Cloud Upon The Sanctuary\", published in 1795, explained in some detail their character and motivations. Several 19th and 20th century occultists claimed to belong to or to have contacted these Secret Chiefs and made these communications known to others, including H.P. Blavatsky (who called them the \"Tibetan Masters\" or Mahatmas), C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey (who called them Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (who called them Ascended Masters), Aleister Crowley (who used the term to refer to members of the upper three grades of his order, A∴A∴ ), Dion Fortune (who called them the \"esoteric order\"), and Max Heindel (who called them the \"Elder Brothers\").\n\nIn certain esoteric teachings of Islam, there is said to be a cosmic spiritual hierarchy whose ranks include \"walis\" (saints, friends of God), \"abdals\" (changed ones), which is headed by a \"Ghawth\" (helper) or \"Qutb\" (pole, axis). The details vary according to the source.\n\nOne source is the 12th Century Persian Ali Hujwiri. In his divine court, there are three hundred \"akhyār\" (“excellent ones”), forty \"abdāl\" (“substitutes”), seven \"abrār\" (“piously devoted ones”), four \"awtād\" (“pillars”) three \"nuqabā\" (“leaders”) and one qutb.\n\"All these saints know one another and cannot act without mutual consent. It is the task of the Awtad to go round the whole world every night, and if there should be any place on which their eyes have not fallen, next day some flaw will appear in that place, and they must then inform the Qutb in order that he may direct his attention to the weak spot and that by his blessings the imperfection may be remedied\".\nAnother is from Ibn Arabī, who lived in Moorish Spain. It has a more exclusive structure. There are eight \"nujabā\" (“nobles”), twelve \"nuqabā\", seven \"abdāl\", four \"awtād\", two \"a’immah\" (“guides”), and the qutb.\n\nAccording to the 20th century Sufi Inayat Khan, there are seven degrees in the hierarchy. In ascending order, they are Pir, Buzurg, Wali, Ghaus, Qutb, Nabi and Rasul He does not say how the levels are populated. Pirs and Buzurgs assist the spiritual progress of those who approach them. Walis may take responsibility for protecting a community and generally work in secret. Qutbs are similarly responsible for large regions. Nabis are charged with bringing a reforming message to nations or faiths, and hence have a public role. Rasools likewise have a mission of transformation of the world at large.\n\nHelena Blavatsky's theosophy, a blend of Western Occultism and Asian religious philosophy, proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the Great White Brotherhood. Later offshoots of the Theosophical Society used the term Ascended master or Mahatma.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, Ascended Master are believed to be spiritually enlightened beings who in past incarnations were ordinary humans, but who have undergone a series of spiritual transformations originally called \"initiations\".\n\nBoth \"Mahatmas\" and \"Ascended Master\" are terms used in the Ascended Master Teachings. Ascended Master is based on the Theosophical concept of the Mahatma or \"Master of the Ancient Wisdom.\" However, \"Mahatmas\" and \"Ascended Masters\" are believed by some to differ in certain respects.\n\nThe \"Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn\" was founded by those claiming to be in communication with the Secret Chiefs. One of these Secret Chiefs was Anna Sprengel. Her name and address were decoded from the Cipher Manuscripts.\n\nIn 1892, Mathers was convinced that he had contacted these Secret Chiefs, and that this confirmed his position as head of the Golden Dawn. He declared this in a manifesto four years later saying that they were human and living on Earth, yet possessed terrible superhuman powers. He used this status to found the \"Second Order\" within the Golden Dawn, and to introduce the \"Adeptus Minor\" ritual.\n\nWhile in Algeria in 1909, Crowley, along with Victor Neuburg, recited numerous Enochian Calls or Aires. After the fifteenth Aire, he was told that he had attained the grade of Magister Templi (Master of the Temple), which meant that he himself was now on the level of these Secret Chiefs, although this declaration caused many legitimate occultists to stop taking him seriously if they had not done so already. He also described this attainment as a possible and in fact a necessary step for all who truly followed his path.\n\nIn 1947, when Aleister Crowley died, he left behind a sketch of one of the \"Secret Chiefs\", Crowley's invisible mentor that he called LAM. The sketch looks like a Grey Alien.\n\nThe Graeco-Armenian G. I. Gurdjieff's teachings, known as the Fourth Way, mentioned a \"Universal Brotherhood\" and also a mysterious group of monks called the \"Sarmoung\" (also: \"Sarman\", \"Sarmouni\"). Both groups were described as in possession of advanced knowledge and powers, and as being open to suitable candidates from all creeds. He also believed in advanced kinds of humans called \"man number 6\" and \"man number seven\", of whom he said:-\nThey cannot perform actions opposed to their understanding or have an understanding which is not expressed by actions. At the same time there can be no discords among them, no differences of understanding. Therefore their activity is entirely co-ordinated and leads to one common aim without any kind of compulsion because it is based upon a common and identical understanding.\n...although he never explicitly linked \"higher man\" to his \"brotherhoods\".\n\nJ. G. Bennett, was both a prominent student of Gurdjieff and an independent thinker. In his work \"The Dramatic Universe\" he speculated on a discarnate Hidden Directorate, or \"Demiurgic intelligences\". He later linked the Hidden Directorate with a historically attested lineage of Sufis, the Khwajagan. These theories, influenced by a Turkish Sufi called Hasan Shushud, were spelled out in his last book, \"Masters of Wisdom\".\n\nThe Afghan-Scottish teacher Idries Shah regarded himself as a Sufi, not a Fourth Way exponent, although he took on pupils from Bennett's, and other, Gurdjieff groups. He mentioned the Sarmoung or Sarman several times in his works. Shah also linked a number of Western initiatory groups such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons to Sufis.\n\nIn 1986, the journalist Edward Campbell wrote a book, \"The People of the Secret\", under the pseudonym \"Ernest Scott\". The author, referring to a thesis first published by John G. Bennett in his work \"The Dramatic Universe\" in 1956, postulates that there is a \"Hidden Directorate\" influencing, guiding and intervening in humanity's destiny over the centuries. According to the author, amongst those with links to the directorate are the Sufi and Sarmouni mystics. The work was published by the writer, thinker and Sufi teacher Idries Shah's Octagon Press.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located south of Sidcup and north of Orpington.\n\nThe village includes a small parade of shops, as well as part of the industrial estate on Cray Avenue that connects to its sister St Mary Cray. The former Broomwood pub is now a McDonald's and lies on the main road. Like St Mary Cray, St Paul's Cray is home to a large ex-traveller community as well as many descendants of Irish travellers who moved south from Bermondsey after the docks shut. The local football team, Cray Wanderers F.C., is one of the oldest football clubs in the world. Cray Wanderers were looking to return to the area at Sandy Lane. In September 2013, permission to develop Sandy Lane was refused by LB Bromley. Cray Wanderers announced on 6 October 2014 an intention to purchase Flamingo Park, adjacent to the A20 Sidcup by-pass, subject to receiving planning permission from LB Bromley for a football stadium and sports centre to be built there.\n\nThough modern in appearance, St Paul’s Cray has an ancient history. Romans camped along the banks of the river, and even earlier settlements are suggested by the mysterious dene holes, caverns shaped in the chalk, which have been found on either side of the valley. Sir Simon de Cray held the manor in the time of Edward I. He took his name from St Paul’s Cray. He was knighted for his part in the Scottish wars. He became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1275.\n\nThe name St Paul’s Cray has no direct connection with St Paul the Apostle; it is simply an abbreviation of St Paulinus Cray. The 11th-century church, made redundant in 1978 but now occupied by the Redeemed Christian Church of God, is sited on Main Road on the attractive riverside section of the St Paul’s Cray Conservation Area. From its structural form, it would appear to be a possibly Saxon foundation and certainly earlier than the thirteenth-century St Mary’s. A rare dedication suggests that a church could have occupied the site in the early seventh century. (Paulinus was an early Christian missionary, and a close contemporary of Augustine who subsequently became Archbishop of York and Bishop of Rochester.)\n\nThe area was known in the 16th century as Paul Crey. William Camden born in 1551 writes in a 1610 travel guide in a section on Kent: \"Here the riverlet Crey, anciently called Crecan , intermingleth it selfe with Darent, ? when in his short course he hath imparted his name to five townlets which hee watereth,as Saint Marie Crey, Pauls Crey, Votes-Crey, North Crey,? and Crey-ford in former ages Crecanford, where Hengest the Saxon, the eighth yeare after his arrivall, joyned battaile with the Britans, and after hee had slaine their captaines brought them under with so great a slaughter that afterwards hee never stood in feare of them, but established his kingdome quietly in Kent.\"\nWhile some development has taken place on the east side of the old village, open country with a belt of woodland extends to the hamlet of Hockenden and the borough boundary. On the west side, a large housing estate to accommodate 10,000 of London’s overspill has swallowed up farm and woodland since the Second World War. This new township which extends as far west as Chislehurst Common has its own shopping centre, churches, schools, library and industrial estate. Sports facilities are found at the recreation ground, with Hoblingwell Wood to the rear.\n\nSt Paul's Cray borders Foots Cray to the north, Ruxley to the north east, Swanley to the east, St Mary Cray to the south east and south, Petts Wood to the south west and west and Chislehurst to the north west.\n\nSt Pauls Cray is served by Transport for London bus routes 51 to Woolwich via Sidcup and to Orpington, 273 to Lewisham via Grove Park and to Petts Wood, B14 to Bexleyheath via Sidcup and to Orpington, R1 to Green Street Green, and R11 to Sidcup and Green Street Green.

{"id": "679723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=679723", "title": "Vivien Thomas", "text": "Vivien Thomas\n\nVivien Theodore Thomas (August 29, 1910 – November 26, 1985) was an African-American surgical technician who developed the procedures used to treat blue baby syndrome (now known as cyanotic heart disease) in the 1940s. He was the assistant to surgeon Alfred Blalock in Blalock's experimental animal laboratory at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and later at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He served as supervisor of the surgical laboratories at Johns Hopkins for 35 years. In 1976 Hopkins awarded him an honorary doctorate and named him an instructor of surgery for the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Without any education past high school, Thomas rose above poverty and racism to become a cardiac surgery pioneer and a teacher of operative techniques to many of the country's most prominent surgeons.\n\nA PBS documentary \"Partners of the Heart\", was broadcast in 2003 on PBS's American Experience. In the 2004 HBO movie, \"Something the Lord Made\", Vivien Thomas was portrayed by Mos Def.\n\nThomas was born in New Iberia, Louisiana, and was the son of Mary (Eaton) and William Marco Thomas. The grandson of a slave, he attended Pearl High School in Nashville in the 1920s. Thomas had hoped to attend college and become a doctor, but the Great Depression derailed his plans. He worked at Vanderbilt University in the summer of 1929 doing carpentry but was laid off in the fall. In that same year, Thomas enrolled in the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial College as a premedical student. In the wake of the stock market crash in October, Thomas put his educational plans on hold, and, through a friend, in February 1930 secured a job as surgical research technician with Dr. Alfred Blalock at Vanderbilt University. On his first day of work, Thomas assisted Blalock with a surgical experiment on a dog. At the end of Thomas's first day, Blalock told Thomas they would do another experiment the next morning. Blalock told Thomas to \"come in and put the animal to sleep and get it set up\". Within a few weeks, Thomas was starting surgery on his own. Thomas was classified and paid as a janitor, despite the fact that by the mid-1930s, he was doing the work of a Postdoctoral researcher in the lab.\n\nBefore meeting Blalock, Thomas married Clara and had two daughters. When Nashville's banks failed nine months after starting his job with Blalock and Thomas' savings were wiped out, he abandoned his plans for college and medical school, relieved to have even a low-paying job as the Great Depression deepened.\n\nThomas and Blalock did groundbreaking research into the causes of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. This work later evolved into research on crush syndrome and saved the lives of thousands of soldiers on the battlefields of World War II. In hundreds of experiments, the two disproved traditional theories which held that shock was caused by toxins in the blood. Blalock, a highly original scientific thinker and something of an iconoclast, had theorized that shock resulted from fluid loss outside the vascular bed and that the condition could be effectively treated by fluid replacement. Assisted by Thomas, he was able to provide incontrovertible proof of this theory, and in so doing, he gained wide recognition in the medical community by the mid-1930s. At this same time, Blalock and Thomas began experimental work in vascular and cardiac surgery, defying medical taboos against operating upon the heart. It was this work that laid the foundation for the revolutionary lifesaving surgery they were to perform at Johns Hopkins a decade later.\n\nBy 1940, the work Blalock had done with Thomas placed him at the forefront of American surgery, and when he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at his alma mater Johns Hopkins in 1941, he requested that Thomas accompany him. Thomas arrived in Baltimore with his family in June of that year, confronting a severe housing shortage and a level of racism worse than they had endured in Nashville. Hopkins, like the rest of Baltimore, was rigidly segregated, and the only black employees at the institution were janitors. When Thomas walked the halls in his white lab coat, many heads turned. He began changing into his city clothes when he walked from the laboratory to Blalock's office because he received so much attention. During this time, he lived in the 1200 block of Caroline Street in the community now known as Oliver, Baltimore.\n\nIn 1943, while pursuing his shock research, Blalock was approached by pediatric cardiologist Helen Taussig, who was seeking a surgical solution to a complex and fatal four-part heart anomaly called tetralogy of Fallot (also known as blue baby syndrome, although other cardiac anomalies produce blueness, or cyanosis). In infants born with this defect, blood is shunted past the lungs, thus creating oxygen deprivation and a blue pallor. Having treated many such patients in her work in Hopkins's Harriet Lane Home, Taussig was desperate to find a surgical cure. According to the accounts in Thomas's 1985 autobiography and in a 1967 interview with medical historian Peter Olch, Taussig suggested only that it might be possible to \"reconnect the pipes\" in some way to increase the level of blood flow to the lungs but did not suggest how this could be accomplished. Blalock and Thomas realized immediately that the answer lay in a procedure they had perfected for a different purpose in their Vanderbilt work, involving the anastomosis (joining) of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery, which had the effect of increasing blood flow to the lungs. Thomas was charged with the task of first creating a blue baby-like condition in a dog, and then correcting the condition by means of the pulmonary-to-subclavian anastomosis. Among the dogs on whom Thomas operated was one named Anna, who became the first long-term survivor of the operation and the only animal to have her portrait hung on the walls of Johns Hopkins. In nearly two years of laboratory work involving 200 dogs, Thomas was able to replicate two of the four cardiac anomalies involved in tetralogy of Fallot. He did demonstrate that the corrective procedure was not lethal, thus persuading Blalock that the operation could be safely attempted on a human patient. Blalock was impressed with Thomas's work; when he inspected the procedure performed on Anna, he reportedly said, \"This looks like something the Lord made.\" Even though Thomas knew he was not allowed to operate on patients at that time, he still followed Blalock's rules and assisted him during surgery.\n\nOn November 29, 1943\n, the procedure was first tried on an eighteen-month-old infant named Eileen Saxon. The blue baby syndrome had made her lips and fingers turn blue, with the rest of her skin having a very faint blue tinge. She could only take a few steps before beginning to breathe heavily. Because no instruments for cardiac surgery then existed, Thomas adapted the needles and clamps for the procedure from those in use in the animal lab. During the surgery itself, at Blalock's request, Thomas stood on a step stool at Blalock's shoulder and coached him step by step through the procedure. Thomas performed the operation hundreds of times on a dog, whereas Blalock only once as Thomas' assistant. The surgery was not completely successful, though it did prolong the infant's life for several months. Blalock and his team operated again on an 11-year-old girl, this time with complete success, and the patient was able to leave the hospital three weeks after the surgery. Next, they operated upon a six-year-old boy, who dramatically regained his color at the end of the surgery. The three cases formed the basis for the article that was published in the May 1945 issue of the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", giving credit to Blalock and Taussig for the procedure. Thomas received no mention.\nNews of this groundbreaking story was circulated around the world by the Associated Press. Newsreels touted the event, greatly enhancing the status of Johns Hopkins and solidifying the reputation of Blalock, who had been regarded as a maverick up until that point by some in the Hopkins old guard. Thomas' contribution remained unacknowledged, both by Blalock and by Hopkins. Within a year, the operation known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt had been performed on more than 200 patients at Hopkins, with parents bringing their suffering children from thousands of miles away. \n\nThomas's surgical techniques included one he developed in 1946 for improving circulation in patients whose great vessels (the aorta and the pulmonary artery) were transposed. A complex operation called an atrial septectomy, the procedure was executed so flawlessly by Thomas that Blalock, upon examining the nearly undetectable suture line, was prompted to remark, \"Vivien, this looks like something the Lord made\". To the host of young surgeons Thomas trained during the 1940s, he became a figure of legend, the model of a dexterous and efficient cutting surgeon. \"Even if you'd never seen surgery before, you could do it because Vivien made it look so simple,\" the renowned surgeon Denton Cooley told \"Washingtonian\" magazine in 1989. \"There wasn't a false move, not a wasted motion, when he operated.\" Surgeons like Cooley, along with Alex Haller, Frank Spencer, Rowena Spencer, and others credited Thomas with teaching them the surgical technique that placed them at the forefront of medicine in the United States. Despite the deep respect Thomas was accorded by these surgeons and by the many black lab technicians he trained at Hopkins, he was not well paid. He sometimes resorted to working as a bartender, often at Blalock's parties. This led to the peculiar circumstance of his serving drinks to people he had been teaching earlier in the day. Eventually, after negotiations on his behalf by Blalock, he became the highest paid technician at Johns Hopkins by 1946, and by far the highest paid African-American on the institution's rolls. Although Thomas never wrote or spoke publicly about his ongoing desire to return to college and obtain a medical degree, his widow, the late Clara Flanders Thomas, revealed in a 1987 interview with \"Washingtonian\" writer Katie McCabe that her husband had clung to the possibility of further education throughout the blue baby period and had only abandoned the idea with great reluctance. Mrs. Thomas stated that in 1947, Thomas had investigated the possibility of enrolling in college and pursuing his dream of becoming a doctor, but had been deterred by the inflexibility of Morgan State University, which refused to grant him credit for life experience and insisted that he fulfill the standard freshman requirements. Realizing that he would be 50 years old by the time he completed college and medical school, Thomas decided to give up the idea of further education.\n\nBlalock's approach to the issue of Thomas's race was complicated and contradictory throughout their 34-year partnership. On the one hand, he defended his choice of Thomas to his superiors at Vanderbilt and to Hopkins colleagues, and he insisted that Thomas accompany him in the operating room during the first series of tetralogy operations. On the other hand, there were limits to his tolerance, especially when it came to issues of pay, academic acknowledgment, and his social interaction outside of work. Tension with Blalock continued to build when he failed to recognize the contributions that Thomas had made in the world-famous blue baby procedure, which led to a rift in their relationship. Thomas was absent in official articles about the procedure, as well as in team pictures that included all of the doctors involved in the procedure.\n\nAfter Blalock's death from cancer in 1964 at the age of 65, Thomas stayed at Hopkins for 15 more years. In his role as director of Surgical Research Laboratories, he mentored a number of African-American lab technicians as well as Hopkins' first black cardiac resident, Levi Watkins, Jr., whom Thomas assisted with his groundbreaking work in the use of the automatic implantable defibrillator.\n\nThomas' nephew, Koco Eaton, graduated from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, trained by many of the physicians his uncle had trained. Eaton trained in orthopedics and is now the team doctor for the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nIn 1968, the surgeons Thomas trained — who had then become chiefs of surgical departments throughout America — commissioned the painting of his portrait (by Bob Gee, oil on canvas, 1969, The Johns Hopkins Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives) and arranged to have it hung next to Blalock's in the lobby of the Alfred Blalock Clinical Sciences Building.\n\nIn 1976, Johns Hopkins University presented Thomas with an honorary doctorate. Because of certain restrictions, he received an Honorary Doctor of Laws, rather than a medical doctorate, but it did allow the staff and students of Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to call him doctor. After having worked there for 37 years, Thomas was also finally appointed to the faculty of the School of Medicine as Instructor of Surgery. Due to his lack of an official medical degree, he was never allowed to operate on a living patient.\n\nIn July 2005, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine began the practice of splitting incoming first-year students into four colleges, each named for famous Hopkins faculty members who had major impacts on the history of medicine. Thomas was chosen as one of the four, along with Helen Taussig, Florence Sabin, and Daniel Nathans.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1979, Thomas began work on an autobiography. He died of pancreatic cancer on November 26, 1985, and the book was published just days later. Having learned about Thomas on the day of his death, \"Washingtonian\" writer Katie McCabe brought his story to public attention in a 1989 article entitled \"Like Something the Lord Made\", which won the 1990 National Magazine Award for Feature Writing and inspired filmmaker Andrea Kalin to make the PBS documentary \"Partners of the Heart\", which was broadcast in 2003 on PBS's American Experience and won the Organization of American Historians's Erik Barnouw Award for Best History Documentary in 2004. McCabe's article, brought to Hollywood by Washington, D.C. dentist Irving Sorkin, formed the basis for the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning 2004 HBO film \"Something the Lord Made\".\n\nThomas's legacy as an educator and scientist continued with the institution of the Vivien Thomas Young Investigator Awards, given by the Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesiology beginning in 1996. In 1993, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation instituted the Vivien Thomas Scholarship for Medical Science and Research sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline. In fall 2004, the Baltimore City Public School System opened the Vivien T. Thomas Medical Arts Academy, and on January 29, 2008, MedStar Health unveiled the first \"Rx for Success\" program at the Academy, joining the conventional curriculum with specialized coursework geared to the health care professions. In the halls of the school hangs a replica of Thomas's portrait commissioned by his surgeon-trainees in 1969. The \"Journal of Surgical Case Reports\" announced in January 2010 that its annual prizes for the best case report written by a doctor and best case report written by a medical student would be named after Thomas.\n\n\n\n"}

Bouma was a technically refined left back or centre back known for his hard working nature, defensive positioning and tackling ability.\n\nBorn in Helmond, North Brabant, Bouma started his career at amateur club SV Rood-Wit '62 before joining PSV on a youth contract in 1994. The PSV head coach at the time, Aad de Mos handed him his professional debut against Willem II on 26 October 1994 which his team lost 2–1. After not featuring for a long time, he was loaned out to MVV in 1996 and played in the Eerste Divisie where he scored seven goals in 18 games. The following season, he scored sixteen goals in 33 games after helping his team back into the Eredivisie. After impressing at Fortuna Sittard in 1998–99, he was drafted back into the PSV squad the following season.\n\nAt PSV, he played as a left winger and as forward because of his quick pace and direct passing, teaming up with Arnold Bruggink and at times, with Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\nWhen Arthur Numan departed to Rangers at the end of the 1999–00 season, Bouma was moved to left-back where he had to compete with Danish international Jan Heintze.\n\nWith the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers entering its crucial stages, Bouma was handed his international debut for the Dutch national team against the Republic of Ireland on 2 September 2000. In the Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal, he was chosen by Dick Advocaat to play as a central defender and he has also retained that spot while playing for PSV under Guus Hiddink in the 2004–05 season.\n\nJust before the close of the international transfer window, Bouma signed for Aston Villa on 30 August 2005 for £3.5 million. He struggled to establish himself during the 2005–06 campaign at Villa Park, as his debut season was heavily tarnished with injuries. However, when Martin O'Neill replaced boss David O'Leary, Bouma – after recovering from a hamstring injury – replaced stand-in left-back Gareth Barry.\n\nUnder O'Neill, Bouma begun to flourish during the 2006–07 season – he established himself as first choice left back and went on to total 28 appearances in the claret and blue shirt. This led to Bouma becoming a cult hero at Villa Park, most notably for his strong tackling, and determined nature in defence. This turn in form also attributed to Bouma reclaiming his place in the Dutch National Team, playing in the friendly against Russia in February 2007, the tour of Asia in June 2007 and the following UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying fixtures.\n\nOn 9 February 2008, Bouma – who was in the process of making his 76th appearance in claret and blue – netted his only goal for the club in the 48th minute of the match against Newcastle United. The deflected goal levelled the game at 1–1, before a hat-trick by teammate John Carew, wrapped up a 4–1 victory.\n\nUpon returning from international duty for the Netherlands at Euro 2008, Bouma participated in both legs of Aston Villa's Intertoto Cup third round tie against Odense, however the second leg at Villa Park on 26 July 2008 was marred by a serious ankle injury to the full-back. Bouma caught his studs on the turf as he attempted to challenge opposition forward Baye Djiby Fall. Initially, the injury looked like a horrific break, however reports later confirmed that Bouma had suffered a dislocation, an injury which looked set to keep him out until October. His recovery however took much longer. Bouma's increasing importance to the Villa cause, as well as his 'cult-hero status' was noted as he was carried off early in the tie whilst being accompanied by a 30,000 strong chant of support by the Villa faithful.\n\nOn 9 September 2008, Bouma signed a new two-year deal at Villa Park with the option of a third year.\n\nIn January 2009 it was announced that Bouma, along with other long-term absentee John Carew had returned to full training. He was scheduled to return on 16 February for the reserves but he pulled out at the last minute because he \"felt sore\". On 2 March 2009, Bouma finally played 90 minutes in a 4–3 win in a reserve match against Chelsea. However, he suffered a setback on his road to recovery in April after learning bone fragments had broken away from his ankle, and underwent surgery soon after.\n\nOn 16 September 2009, after being out of action for fourteen months, it was announced that Bouma had resumed full training with the club. However, Bouma's injury worries were not yet over. Yet to make a return to Villa's first team, Bouma suffered another setback and was again out of action with a stubbed toe injury.\n\nOn 29 January 2010, Aston Villa announced that Bouma had finally returned to full training following eighteen months of absence through injury. However, while Bouma played a full ninety minutes for the Aston Villa reserves in February 2010, he never made a return to the first team. On 6 May 2010, Aston Villa confirmed that Bouma was set to leave the club at the end of the 2009–2010 season. Bouma said his goodbyes to the Villa faithful during half-time of the home defeat to Blackburn in their final league game, later stating that he intended to address the fans but \"just couldn't do it\" after becoming too emotional.\n\nOn 26 June 2010, it was revealed that Bouma's former club PSV Eindhoven had offered him a trial at the club in an attempt to revive his career and he joined up with the rest of the PSV squad for pre-season training. Bouma later sealed his return on 30 August 2010, signing a two-year contract with the club. Bouma scored his first goal since his return to the Netherlands in a 3–0 home win against VVV-Venlo. Bouma played 66 minutes during a record Eredivisie 10–0 victory over Feyenoord.\n\nBouma continued his good goal scoring form when he netted his third goal in only 16 league games during the 0–3 away win against VVV-Venlo. On 24 February 2011 Bouma was handed the captain's armband for the final five minutes of the UEFA Europa League match against Lille OSC that PSV went on to win 3–1 on the day and 5–3 on aggregate.\n\nBouma was a member of the Dutch squad at the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship. As of July 2008, Wilfred Bouma has played for the Netherlands 35 times, scoring twice. Bouma made his debut on 2 September 2000, in the 2–2 draw with the Republic of Ireland. Several steady appearances followed in the coming years, including 4 appearances at Euro 2004, whilst playing as a centre-back. Bouma was included in the Dutch squad for Euro 2008, and he made 2 appearances, coming on as a 78th substitute against France and playing the full 90 minutes against Romania. Bouma's only two goals at international level came within 4 months of each other, as the defender netted in the 3–2 defeat to Czech Republic in the group stage of Euro 2004. He then went on to net the opener against Macedonia in October of the same year, in a match which ended 2–2.\n\nPSV Eindhoven\n\n\nWilfred Bouma married partner Anja in June 2007, with whom he has two children – son Gino and daughter Lola.\n\n"}

He was the first to convince the scientific mainstream that the Earth had once been hit by a planet sized body (Theia), creating both the moon and the Earth's 23.5° tilt.\n\nBorn in Pennsylvania in 1939, he received his B.S. in physics from Pennsylvania State University, and an M.S. in geology and PhD in astronomy from the University of Arizona. His career spans over 40 years, from work in the early 1960s with Gerard Kuiper on Mare Orientale, and work on the Mariner 9 Mars mapping project, to current work on the Mars Global Surveyor imaging team. He is currently a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute.\n\nHe has long been one of America's leading space artists (strongly influenced by Chesley Bonestell), and has written and illustrated numerous books on the history of Earth and the Solar System, often in collaboration with artist Ron Miller.\n\nHartmann is a Fellow of the International Association of Astronomical Artists. His written work also includes textbooks, short fiction, and novels, the most recent being published in 2003. In 1997 he was the first recipient of the \"Carl Sagan Medal for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science\" from the American Astronomical Society, Division for Planetary Sciences.\n\nHartmann was a member of the 1966–1968 University of Colorado UFO Project (informally known as the Condon Committee), a controversial public study of UFOs sponsored by the U.S. Air Force. He primarily investigated photographic evidence, and rejected most as unreliable or inconclusive; in his studies published in the Committee's final report, he concluded two cases - Great Falls (motion pictures of two bright light sources difficult to reconcile with known aircraft) and McMinnville (two photographs of a saucer-shaped craft) - were unexplained and particularly noteworthy as probative evidence of the reality of UFOs.\n\nAsteroid 3341 Hartmann is named after him.\n\n\n\n"}
