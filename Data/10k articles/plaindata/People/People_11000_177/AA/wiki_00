{"id": "3223232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3223232", "title": "Adam Morrison", "text": "Adam Morrison\n\nAdam John Morrison (born July 19, 1984) is a retired American professional basketball player. Morrison played for three years at Gonzaga University and was considered to be one of the top college basketball players in 2005–06. He was a finalist for the Naismith and the Wooden Award. He was named Co-Player of the Year with Duke's J. J. Redick by the United States Basketball Writers Association and won the 2006 Chevrolet Player of the Year award.\n\nMorrison's father, John, worked as a basketball coach, and the family moved with his coaching career: Casper College in Northwest Casper, Wyoming, Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, and Dawson Community College in Glendive, Montana. When Morrison was in the fourth grade, his father left coaching, and the family moved to Spokane, Washington. Adam became the Gonzaga men's team's ball boy.\n\nWhen he was in the eighth grade, he lost 30 pounds (14 kg), and while attending a basketball camp at Gonzaga during this time, he felt sick, later saying about his experience at the camp, \"I think I made one shot the whole three days. I was sicker than a dog. I didn't want to play. I couldn't do anything.\" Shortly after this, Morrison was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He took his diagnosis surprisingly well; the second time a nurse came to administer insulin, he stopped her, telling her, \"Since I'm going to be doing this the rest of my life, you might as well show me how to do it.\" However, his illness did not keep him from becoming a star at Mead Senior High School in Spokane. In his senior year he broke single-season and career scoring records in his high school conference, and led Mead to the finals of the state tournament. Despite playing in the final game with hypoglycemia so severe that he nearly suffered a seizure, he scored 37 points in a losing effort. It was Mead's only loss that season. Morrison was not heavily recruited out of high school. Dave Telep of scout.com admitted, \"In one of the biggest misses of my career, we left him off the Top 100 list. We ranked him the No. 26 small forward. The goal is to never make a mistake of that magnitude again\".\n\nMorrison arrived at Gonzaga University to play for the Gonzaga Bulldogs in 2003. In his freshman year he averaged 11.4 points per game (ppg), with a season-high 22 points against St. Mary's. Gonzaga won the West Coast Conference (WCC) regular-season title. Morrison was named to the WCC All-Freshman Team.\n\nIn his sophomore year Morrison averaged 19.0 ppg. He scored a season-high 28 points at home against San Francisco, including the winning shot with 0.6 seconds to play in the game. Gonzaga again won the WCC regular-season title. Morrison made the All-WCC First Team and was selected to the \"Basketball Times\" All-West Coast Team as well as being named an honorable mention Associated Press All-American.\n\nIn his junior year during Gonzaga's first two games of the 2005–06 season at the Maui Invitational, Morrison played well against two of the sport's top programs. In the first round, Morrison scored 25 points in a Gonzaga win over Maryland. He followed up this performance with 43 points in a triple-overtime win over Michigan State in the semifinals. He matched that output against in-state rival Washington on December 4, 2005, in a losing effort. However, Morrison and the Zags bounced back a week later, defeating Oklahoma State after he banked in a three-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to give Gonzaga a two-point lead and eventually the win.\n\nIn the regular season, he had 13 games of 30-plus points, with five of them over 40. At 28.1 points per game, he was the nation's leading scorer in 2005–2006. His scoring totals against teams in the \"major\" conferences were no less impressive; he averaged 28.5 points in 11 such games. On February 18, Morrison recorded a career high 44 points (including 37 in the second half alone) against the Loyola Marymount Lions in a winning effort.\n\nMorrison led the Zags with 24 points in a 2006 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen match against UCLA, which the Zags lost in the final seconds after UCLA had eliminated a 17-point deficit coming out of the first half. With seconds left, the lead having slipped away, Morrison broke down in tears and collapsed to the court. He was eventually helped to his feet by UCLA player Arron Afflalo. He has been both criticized and praised for this unbridled show of emotion. He later shared the national player of the year award with friendly rival J. J. Redick of Duke. The game against UCLA turned out to be Morrison's final collegiate game, as he later decided to turn pro, foregoing his senior year of college.\n\nAdam John Morrison was selected 3rd overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Charlotte Bobcats, behind Andrea Bargnani (Toronto Raptors) and LaMarcus Aldridge (Chicago Bulls). On July 6, 2006, the Bobcats signed Morrison to a two-year contract. On November 1, 2006, in his NBA debut against the Indiana Pacers he scored 14 points, with 3 rebounds and 2 assists. He was the first player picked by Manager of Basketball Operations Michael Jordan in his tenure with the Bobcats. He scored his career high on December 30, 2006, with 30 points in a win against the Indiana Pacers. However, Morrison lost his starting spot midway through the season, in part for his defense and shooting only 37% for the year.\n\nOn October 21, 2007, the Charlotte Bobcats announced that Morrison had sustained a severe injury to his left knee in a pre-season exhibition game against the L.A. Lakers while defending Luke Walton, bending his knee laterally and falling to the ground in pain. An MRI scan performed after the game indicated a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). On November 10 Morrison underwent surgery to repair the damage. The injury was confirmed to be a torn ACL, requiring several months of physical therapy after the knee had healed, meaning he missed the whole 2007–08 NBA season.\n\nOn February 7, 2009, Morrison and Shannon Brown were traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vladimir Radmanović. Morrison won two NBA championships with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010, but saw very limited playing time. He was released following the 2009–10 season.\n\nMorrison later signed with the Washington Wizards, but was waived at the end of training camp.\n\nIn September 2011, Morrison signed with KK Crvena zvezda. He was released from his contract in November 2011 to pursue other opportunities. During his 8 game stay in Belgrade (he missed one away match due to a minor injury problem), Morrison averaged 15.5 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 29 minutes a game, becoming his team's top scorer and the second overall top performer during the 2011–12 Adriatic League season.\n\nIn January 2012, Morrison signed with Beşiktaş Milangaz for the rest of the 2011–12 season. However, he left the team in April 2012 due to a lack of playing time.\n\nAfter being absent from the NBA since being waived by the Wizards, Morrison played in the 2012 NBA Summer League for the Brooklyn Nets and averaged 5.2 points and 19.2 minutes in five games with the team. He then joined the Los Angeles Clippers' Summer League team, averaging 20.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.0 assists on 55% FG (38-69), 61% 3-PT (13-21) and 78% FT (11-14) in 5 games. On September 21, 2012, Morrison signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. He was waived on October 27, 2012.\n\nMorrison made four appearances for various junior U.S. national teams. Morrison was selected to train with the senior men's team in preparation for the 2006 FIBA World Championship but was cut prior to the tournament.\n\nIn July 2013, Gonzaga basketball coach Mark Few announced that Morrison would become a student assistant with the basketball team. Morrison had returned to Gonzaga to take classes. After completing his undergraduate degree at Gonzaga in 2014, majoring in sports management, Morrison became an assistant video coordinator for the Bulldogs for the 2014–15 season, but was weighing options for his career after the season would come to an end.\n\nMorrison lives near Spokane, Washington, with his girlfriend, two daughters, and a son. He claims not to be religious and does not believe in marriage.\n\nMorrison was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes) at age 13. He was playing in an eighth-grade basketball game, and as the game went into overtime, he began having seizure-like symptoms, which prompted his father to take him to the hospital where the diagnosis was made. Morrison, who managed his diabetes to the point of eating exactly the same meals at the same time on game days, is considered a role model for children with the disease and their families. During his freshman year at Gonzaga, Morrison and his life with diabetes were a subject of a four-page article in \"Sports Illustrated\". On the first day that the issue appeared in retail outlets, more than fifty parents of children with diabetes contacted the Gonzaga athletics department asking if Morrison could speak to their children. Off the court, Morrison regulates his blood sugar with an insulin pump attached to his abdomen.\n\n"}

His career in gay film started when he was \"discovered\" by Rip Colt, founder of \"Colt Studios\". Colt gave him the performance name \"Al Parker.\"\n\nParker began his filmmaking career when he signed with Brentwood Studios. He initially made short loop films shot on 8 mm reels.\n\nParker was a producer, director, and actor. His company, Surge Studios, produced \"theme\" gay adult features, not just short loops. Many of the films were shot out of Parker's home in Hermosa Beach, California. Surge Studios was one of the first studios to mandate safe sex practices when AIDS appeared.\n\nIn 1969, Parker's mother encouraged him to attend the Woodstock Music Festival, believing that it was a classical music festival. After he was forced to abandon his mother's new car in the mud along the road leading to the festival, he encountered what he regarded as his first wholly satisfying sexual experience. His picture was taken there and appears on the poster collage for the \"Woodstock\" concert film released in 1970.\n\nParker was one of the interview subjects of Dr. Dean Edell, who reported a surgical procedure that sought to restore Parker's foreskin from his at-birth circumcision. The surgery was performed by Dr. Ira Sharlip, a urologist. The report was broadcast on television.\n\nParker died in San Francisco. His remains were cremated and a memorial service was held at his private residence. His ashes were scattered in the ocean near the nude section of San Gregorio State Beach, San Mateo County, California.\n\nParker is the subject of Roger Edmonson's biography \"Clone: The Life and Legacy of Al Parker Gay Superstar\".\n\nParker's life is depicted in playwright Drew Sachs' play, \"aka Al Parker\". \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27959140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27959140", "title": "Bolesław the Forgotten", "text": "Bolesław the Forgotten\n\nBolesław the Forgotten () or the Cruel (; before 1016 – 1038/39) was a semi-legendary Duke of Poland of the Piast dynasty from 1034 until his death in 1038 or 1039. He was allegedly the first-born son of Mieszko II Lambert.\n\nHe is described in the \"Wielkopolska Chronicle\", written in the 14th century, where he is said to have taken power in Poland after the death of his father Mieszko II, as he was the eldest son. According to the chronicle he was killed because of his extreme cruelty, and sentenced to the \"Damnatio memoriae\". The Julian calendar was in use so New Year's Day had not been changed to the first day of January. The text describes him as follows:\n\nHowever, there is no mention of any coronation of a Polish ruler in this period, which would have to be recorded in the German sources (as was the case with the coronations of Bolesław I and Mieszko II), probably because there was no royal insignia in the country, which had been returned to the Emperor by the well-known Bezprym earlier in the year 1031.\n\nThis brief description of Bolesław in the \"Wielkopolska Chronicle\" is very similar with the information about Bezprym who was described in the \"Chronicles of Hildesheim\":\n\nBolesław's life is also described in a text written by Wincenty z Kielczy (13th century) and some other sources. In the \"Annals of Kraków\" under the date of 1038 was placed the information about a \"king Bolesław's\" death. This date cannot be connected with Bolesław I Chrobry (who died in 1025) and Bolesław II the Bold (dead in 1081, deposed and exiled) so it may refer to the Forgotten. In addition, an indirect reference to his existence may be found in the \"Małopolska Chronicle\", where Bolesław III Wrymouth is called Bolesław IV. Also, in the \"Tyniec Codec\" (destroyed in the 19th century), Bolesław II the Generous was given the Roman numeral III. This gives some grounds to believe that between Bolesław I Chrobry and Bolesław II could be placed another Bolesław.\n\nForeign chronicles also favored the existence of Bolesław the Forgotten, for example:\n\n\nIn older times Bolesław was widely described as historical monarch of Poland. Many Polish historians were sure about his existence: Tadeusz Wojciechowski, Oswald Balzer, Roman Grodecki, Feliks Koneczny, Stanisław Zakrzewski, and Zygmunt Wojciechowski. They had the following arguments:\n\n\nSome say that Gallus Anonymus failed to describe Bolesław because of the ruler's part in the pagan reaction in Poland.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6829413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6829413", "title": "Béla Király", "text": "Béla Király\n\nDr. Béla Király (14 April 1912 – 4 July 2009) was a Hungarian army officer before, during, and after World War II. After the war, he was sentenced to life in prison under the Soviet-allied regime, but was later released. After his release, he commanded the National Guard in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. He then fled to the United States, where he became an academic historian. He returned to Hungary after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and was elected a member of Hungarian Parliament.\n\nHe was born in Kaposvár, Hungary, the son of a station master. As a youth he bred pigeons, a lifelong interest. His ambition to be a veterinary surgeon foundered because his family could not afford the fees. Color blindness barred his employment by the railroad. In 1930, military service became compulsory - two years for conscripts but only one year for volunteers. He joined the army, found it interesting, finished the Ludovika Military Academy in the top 5% of his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant 20 August 1935. As a student at the General Staff Academy he was promoted to captain in December 1942.\n\nHungary joined the Axis powers and declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941. Király saw combat on the eastern front and was twice wounded. In 1943 he commanded 400 men guarding a Jewish labor battalion in the Don River valley. Contrary to orders, he provided them with warm clothing, decent food, and medical attention. In 1993, Yad Vashem named him one of the “Righteous Among the Nations”, recognizing his humane treatment of the Jewish prisoners.\n\nIn March 1945 Király commanded the defense of Kőszeg. Upon surrendering the city to the Red Army, he was arrested and sent to Siberia as a prisoner of war. He returned home following the Paris Peace Treaties, and joined the Hungarian Communist Party and the new Hungarian People's Army.\n\nCommunist officials warned him against his 1947 marriage to the widowed niece of far-right former prime minister Gyula Gömbös, who was, for much of his career, anti-semitic. He expected to be sacked when General György Pálffy summoned him, but instead was appointed to command the Training Department. He was promoted to general in 1950, and later to the rank of major general. In 1950, he was put in command of the infantry. He was expected to command the Hungarian component of a planned Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia following the Tito–Stalin Split. Stalin ceased the operation, however, discouraged by the success of American intervention in the Korean War. According to Király, the situation in Korea \"nipped Stalin's pet project in the bud\".\n\nIn 1951, the Mátyás Rákosi regime arrested him on charges of subversion, sedition, and espionage. He was sentenced on January 15, 1952 to death by hanging. His wife was detained by the ÁVH from August 1951 until August 1953. She divorced him in 1955. He then learned that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment at hard labor. In September 1956 the government of Imre Nagy paroled him along with other prisoners, a measure intended to soften public unrest.\n\nThe Hungarian Revolution of 1956 began shortly after his release from prison. He was ill and recovering from surgery, but he escaped the hospital to join the Hungarian revolutionaries and accept appointment as commander-in-chief of the military guard and military commander of Budapest against the Soviets.\n\nViolence broke out in Budapest on October 23, 1956. Soviet troops, unprepared for the strength of the revolutionary forces, arranged a ceasefire on October 28, and began to retreat from the city. The violence subsisted, however, as pro-Nagy communists and various nationalist factions engineered purges of pro-Soviet party members in the city. Király, sensing a chaotic fragmentation of the revolutionary forces, sought to unite various anti-Soviet factions into a National Guard. On October 30, 1956, Király-led revolutionaries attacked the building of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The revolutionaries detained dozens of suspected pro-Soviets, executing many on the spot. Similar purges continued throughout the city.\n\nIn spite of the continued violence directed against pro-Soviet communists, Soviet correspondent Anastas Mikoyan advised against a Soviet invasion, wishing for the Hungarian communists to suppress the \"counter-revolution\" themselves. This inaction led many pro-Soviets to question their loyalties. As Nikita Khrushchev lost confidence in the ability of the Hungarian communists the suppress the uprising, he directed the Soviet army to invade Budapest on November 4.\n\nKirály recognized his forces, loyal to Nagy, had no hope of victory over the Soviet army. However, he resented Soviet ambassador Yuri Andropov's concealing of the imminent invasion, which Nikita Khrushchev had officially decided upon 3 days prior.\nAfter the Soviets successfully suppressed the revolution, Király fled to the United States through Austria to avoid capture. He was, however, sentenced to death \"in absentia\" back in the Soviet Union (a fate which other revolutionary leaders like Nagy did not escape).\n\nKirály was well regarded in the United States, as the U.S. had been supportive of the Nagy-led government to which Király had been loyal. He arrived speaking good English, having taught himself through an English-Hungarian dictionary while in prison. He enrolled in Columbia University earned a graduate degree in history. From 1964 he taught Military History at Brooklyn College, and became chairman of the history department. He retired as Professor Emeritus in 1982. During his tenure he served as director of the Society In Change Program on East Central Europe, supervised Brooklyn College Press (the College's Publishing House), and was an adviser to the Brooklyn College Military History Club. The Brooklyn College Bela K. Kiraly Award, awarded to undergraduate students for outstanding work in modern history, bears his name.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, he was an invited guest at Imre Nagy's funeral and re-interment, June 1989. He moved back to Hungary later that year, and was elected to the Hungarian National Assembly, representing his birthplace Kaposvár. He served from May–November 1990 as an independent deputy, then joined the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) parliamentary group, later assuming the role of a government adviser. In 2004, he was made an associate member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nKirály died in his sleep in Budapest on 4 July 2009, aged 97.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "9807892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9807892", "title": "Donald Edmond Pelotte", "text": "Donald Edmond Pelotte\n\nDonald E. Pelotte SSS (April 13, 1945 – January 7, 2010) was the third Roman Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Gallup, New Mexico. He was the first person of Native American descent to become a Catholic bishop in the United States; Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., is the only active American diocesan bishop of Native American descent. He is also the only known Roman Catholic bishop to have ordained his own twin brother. Bishop Pelotte ordained Father Dana F. Pelotte, SSS, to the priesthood, on September 4, 1999 in their childhood parish of Waterville, Maine.\n\nPelotte was born on April 13, 1945, in Waterville, Maine, to Norris Albert Pelotte and Margaret Yvonne LaBrie Pelotte. His father was a member of the Abenaki First Nations tribe and his mother was of French-Canadian (Québécois) descent. Donald and his twin brother Dana were the youngest of five brothers. He studied at Eymard Seminary in Hyde Park, New York during his high school years. He did his college studies John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio and later completed doctoral studies at Fordham University. His doctoral dissertation was entitled: \"John Courtney Murray, Theologian in Conflict: Roman Catholicism and the American Experience\". This was later published in book form by Paulist Press.\n\nAt age 33, he became the Provincial Superior of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament and was the youngest major superior of a religious community of men in the United States at the time. On February 24, 1986, he was named Coadjutor Bishop of Gallup and was consecrated on May 6, 1986. Upon the retirement of Jerome J. Hastrich, then Bishop of Gallup on March 31, 1990, Pelotte became the Third Bishop of Gallup. From 1986 to 2008, Pelotte also served as the Episcopal moderator of the Tekakwitha Conference, an association of Native American and First Nation Catholics.\n\nBishop Pelotte was seriously injured in his Gallup home on July 23, 2007. His injuries included a traumatic brain injury. According to chancery officials and a police report, Pelotte insisted his injuries resulted from a fall down his home staircase; however, his aide speculated that he \"looked like he'd been beat up\" and that his injuries were more consistent with a brutal assault rather than with a fall down a carpeted stairwell.\n\nOn January 3, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Thomas J. Olmsted, Bishop of Phoenix, as apostolic administrator \"sede plena\" of the diocese of Gallup, and granted Pelotte a one-year leave of absence to continue his recovery.\n\nOn April 30, 2008 Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation from the pastoral government of the Diocese of Gallup, presented by Pelotte, SSS, in accordance with canon 401 § 2 of the Code of Canon Law. Bishop Olmsted continued to govern the diocese as Apostolic Administrator until James S. Wall was appointed bishop of Gallup and took canonical possession of the Diocese on 23 April 2009.\n\nOn Monday, July 8, 2008, KRQE News 13 in Albuquerque and the Gallup Independent newspaper released the results of their investigation of the Pelotte case. Pictures that had not been previously released to the public suggested that the bishop suffered severe blows to the head and back. The station speculated that the injuries did not indicate a fall, but rather a possible beating. The police investigation was closed, though, having never been recalled.\n\nPelotte was hospitalized in critical condition, with his relatives at his side, on December 30, 2009.

McNab's job was to track down those who stole Chisum's cattle. Drifting into Lincoln County from the Texas Panhandle in the mid-1870s, he soon signed on with John Tunstall, as his rivals, a group of cattlemen and cowboys from the Seven Rivers area of Lincoln County were allied with Lawrence Murphy and James Dolan.\n\nWith Tunstall's murder and the outbreak of war, McNab took a prominent position in the Regulator chain of command, second only to foreman Richard \"Dick\" Brewer. McNab, along with other deputized Regulators, captured Dolan gunmen William Morton and Frank Baker. \n\nAs Morton was believed to have been one of those who killed John Tunstall, his fate looked grim, especially when the Regulators and their prisoners detoured on their way to Lincoln into the Capitan foothills. Although the Regulators were intent on killing Morton and Baker rather than turning them over for trial, one of their number, William McCloskey, was friendly with Morton and tried to talk the Regulators out of killing him. On March 9, 1878, the Regulators made their move along the Blackwater Creek. According to Pat Garrett's biography of Billy the Kid, McNab shot McCloskey in the head when he tried to stop the imminent execution of Morton and Baker, who then spurred their mounts and tried to escape before being gunned down by Billy the Kid. \n\nMcNab was one of the triggermen in the killing of Sheriff Brady and his deputy George W. Hindman in Lincoln on April 1, 1878, and was present three days later when they shot it out with Buckshot Roberts. Upon Dick Brewer's death, McNab was elected captain of the Regulators. On April 29, 1878, McNab, Ab Saunders, and Frank Coe were on their way to the latter's ranch. Nine miles below Lincoln, they stopped at the Fritz ranch for a break when they were ambushed by Seven Rivers cowboys, and members of the Jesse Evans Gang, all under the direction of newly appointed Sheriff George Peppin. \n\nSaunders was shot through the hip. Also wounded, McNab scrambled up a gully and tried to get away until a cowboy named Manuel \"Indian\" Segovia caught up with him and shotgunned him to death. Frank Coe surrendered after a shouted parley. In the wake of his death, Doc Scurlock was elected captain of the Regulators. \n\nMcNab's death was avenged several weeks later on May 15, when the Regulators invaded the Seven Rivers area and captured Segovia. He made a futile attempt to escape only to be gunned down by Billy the Kid and Josefita Chavez.\n\n"}

Captured by the Allies at the end of the war, Hößler was charged with crimes against humanity in the First Bergen-Belsen Trial, found guilty, and sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging at Hameln Prison in 1945.\n\nHößler was born in 1906 in the town of Oberdorf, today Marktoberdorf, in the Schwabenland of the German Empire. The son of a foreman, he quit school early to become a photographer. Later employed as a warehouse worker, he was unemployed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. He joined the Nazi Party in early November 1932 (member no. 1,374,713) and the SS (member no. 41,940). Hößler was married and had three children.\n\nDuring his time in the SS, Hößler rose to the rank of SS-\"Obersturmführer\" and became a reserve officer in the Waffen-SS. After the establishment of the Dachau concentration camp in July 1933, he became the first member of the guard staff and worked later as a cook. He served at Dachau until after the outbreak of World War II.\n\nIn June 1940, Hößler was transferred to the newly opened Auschwitz I concentration camp as it received the first mass transports. He managed the camp kitchens and was occasionally used as a subcamp supervisor (). He then became a Work Service Leader () at the camp in early 1941. On 28 July 1941, Hößler accompanied a shipment of 575 selected Auschwitz I inmates to the euthanasia center at Sonnenstein Castle, where they were murdered as part of the Action 14f13 program. In June 1942, Hößler, together with Otto Moll and Hans Aumeier, participated in killing 168 survivors of a failed uprising in the punishment section of Auschwitz I. For a few months during 1942 he was also responsible for the construction of a holiday resort for the SS in Żywiec, the so-called \"Solahütte\".\n\nAfter Auschwitz-Birkenau was formally expanded into an extermination camp in 1942, Hößler took on various commands there. From September to November 1942, a brigade composed of prisoners called \"Sonderkommando Hößler\" exhumed 107,000 corpses from mass graves around Auschwitz I in order to burn them in the new Auschwitz II crematoria. The prisoners of the \"Sonderkommando\" were then almost invariably murdered after the action. To conduct this disposal, Hößler, along with Rudolf Höß and Walter Dejaco, had previously visited the Chelmno extermination camp on 16 September 1942 to observe tests conducted by Paul Blobel.\n\nAt the same time Hößler worked as before in the old crematorium at the main camp Auschwitz I, including gassings in the bunkers. Johann Kremer, SS camp doctor from 30 August to 17 November 1942, recorded a transport of 1,703 Dutch Jews to the main camp managed by Hoßler. The incident was described in his diary:\n\nBy the middle of 1943, Hößler became involved in recruiting so-called \"Aryan\" prison women, with the prospect of better food and care, for a newly opened camp brothel at the Auschwitz I main camp. He was then promoted to the senior role of \"Schutzhaftlagerführer\" at the Auschwitz-Birkenau women's camp in August 1943, which he directed together with \"Oberaufseherin\" Maria Mandel. In this role he participated in selections and gassings. He succeeded Paul Heinrich Theodor Müller in this capacity. Filip Müller, one of the very few \"Sonderkommando\" members who survived Auschwitz, paraphrased Hößler's speech given to trick a group of Greek Jews in the undressing room at the portals of the gas chambers:\n\nFor a short time between 15 March to 15 May 1944, Hößler was also camp commander () of the Neckarelz concentration camp in Mosbach, Germany, a subcamp of the larger Natzweiler-Struthof camp complex in occupied France. Following the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, he returned to the Auschwitz main camp where he was Protective Custody Camp Leader until its final evacuation in January 1945.\n\nIn January 1945, as the Red Army overran German positions on the Eastern Front, the SS personnel at Auschwitz evacuated to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Auschwitz commander Richard Baer took over the Dora portion of the complex and Hößler was again made a Protective Custody Camp Leader. On 5 April 1945, as American 3rd Armored Division closed in on Mittelbau-Dora, Hößler led a forced evacuation of prisoners to the railhead for transfer to the still-functioning Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The prisoners were then led on a death march for the last stage of their journey.\n\nOn 8 April 1945, Hößler arrived with his transport at Bergen-Belsen and became deputy camp commander under Josef Kramer. There he directly shot prisoners until the liberation of the camp, crimes for which he would be eventually arrested and tried. On 15 April 1945, Hößler was found hiding among the prisoners in camouflaged clothing and was detained with the remaining SS staff by a unit of the British Army. The SS detainees were then forced to bury thousands of corpses lying around on the camp grounds in mass graves.\n\nHößler and 44 other camp staff were tried in the Belsen Trial by a British military court at Lüneburg. The trial lasted several weeks from September to November 1945. During the trial Anita Lasker testified that he took part in selections for the gas chamber. On 17 November 1945 Hößler was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out by British hangman Albert Pierrepoint on 13 December 1945 at Hameln prison.\n\n"}

{"id": "730109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=730109", "title": "Fyodor Tyutchev", "text": "Fyodor Tyutchev\n\nFyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev (, Pre-Reform orthography: Ѳедоръ Ивановичъ Тютчевъ; – ) was a Russian poet and statesman.\n\nTyutchev was born into a Russian noble family in the Ovstug family estate near Bryansk (modern-day Zhukovsky District, Bryansk Oblast of Russia). His father Ivan Nikolaevich Tyutchev (1768—1846) was a court councillor who served in the Kremlin Expedition that managed all building and restoration works of Moscow palaces. One of Ivan's sisters, (1774—1837), was a hegumenia famous for founding the Borisoglebsky Anosin Women's Monastery. The Tyutchevs traced their roots to Zakhariy Tutchev mentioned in \"The Tale of the Rout of Mamai\", a 15th-century epic tale about the Battle of Kulikovo that described him as the most trusted man of Dmitry Donskoy; sent as a messenger to Mamai, he managed to reveal traitors and return alive thanks to his diplomatic skills. Fyodor's mother Ekaterina Lvovna Tolstaya (1776—1866) belonged to the Tolstoy family on her father's side and the Rimsky-Korsakov noble house on her mother's side. Russian war general Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov was her uncle.\n\nMost of his childhood years were spent in Moscow, where he joined the literary circle of Professor Merzlyakov at the age of 13. His first printed work was a translation of Horace's epistle to Maecenas, published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.\n\nHis family tutor was Semyon Raich, a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of Moscow University. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy, to Munich to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.\n\nIn Munich he fell in love with Amalie von Lerchenfeld, the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev's poem \"Tears\" or \"Slyozy\" (\"Liubliu, druz'ya, laskat' ochami...\") coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Amélie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are \"K. N.\", and \"Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe…\" Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822–1826), giving details of his frustrated love affair for Amélie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron Alexander von Krüdener), in January 1825. Amélie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Krüdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title \"K.B.\" (\"Ia vstretil vas - i vsio biloe\"), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Amélie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev's sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer. Tyutchev's last meeting with Amélie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: \n\nYesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Krüdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.\nIn Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet Heinrich Heine and the philosopher Friedrich Schelling. In 1826, he married the Bavarian widow of a Russian diplomat Eleonore Peterson, née Countess von Bothmer. She became the mother of his daughter Anna Tiuttjev. Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness Ernestine von Dörnberg, née von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. \nIn 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev's permission to publish his selected poems in \"Sovremennik\", a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" outlining his strongly held views on Russia's role in the world (see below).\n\nIn 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in Turin. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as chargé d'affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to St Petersburg in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist Leo Tolstoy wooed her, \"almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness\", as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at Konstantin Pobedonostsev's circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.\n\nTyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.\n\nAs a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as \"bagatelles\", not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. Nikolay Nekrasov, when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among \"minor poets\". It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by Ivan Turgenev and others without any help from the author.\n\nIn 1850, he began an illicit affair with Elena Denisyeva, over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from tuberculosis in 1864, and she bore him three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called \"Denisyeva Cycle\" has been variously described by critics as \"a novel in verse\", \"a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion\", and \"a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry\". One of the poems, \"Last Love\", is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in Tsarskoye Selo in 1873 and was interred at Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.\n\nHe was a militant Pan-Slavist, who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, Vatican, Ottoman Empire or Poland, the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the Crimean War made him look critically at the Russian government as well.\n\nOn domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of Tsar Alexander II, particularly the Emancipation Reform of 1861. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.\n\nHis fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: \n\nTyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. Occasional pieces, translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.\n\nThe 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev's world is bipolar. He commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev's idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as \"the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life\". In the chaotic and fathomless world of \"night\", \"winter\", or \"north\" man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the Russian Symbolists such as Vladimir Solovyov, Andrey Bely and Alexander Blok.\n\n\"Silentium!\" is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in silence easier than aloud toward others. Like so many of his poems, its images are anthropomorphic and pulsing with pantheism. As one Russian critic put it, \"the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.\" \n\nIncidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, Georgi Catoire (the setting of the poem in the song \"Silentium\"), while another one of Tyutchev's poems, \"O chem ty voesh' vetr nochnoy...\", was the inspiration for Nikolai Medtner's \"Night Wind\" piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by Rakhmaninov of Tyutchev's poem \"Spring Waters\". While the title of Nikolai Myaskovsky's 1910 tone poem, \"Silence\", may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, Boris Tchaikovsky (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata \"Signs of the Zodiac\". The Ukrainian composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of 'Last Love', recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album 'Stufen'. At the end of Andrey Tarkovsky's film \"Stalker\", a character recites a Tyutchev poem. In 2007, Icelandic musician Björk used this same Tyutchev poem for the lyrics to \"The Dull Flame Of Desire\" from her album \"Volta\".The song was later released as a single in 2008. The 2011 contemporary classical album Troika includes a setting of Tyutchev’s French-language poem “Nous avons pu tous deux…” by the composer Isabelle Aboulker.\n\n\n"}

His brother, Henri-Gaston Darien, was born two years later, in 1864. Henri-Gaston was later to become a \"peintre du genre\" specializing in interiors and scenes of Paris life. He exhibited in the Salons of 1896 and 1897, received the Légion d'honneur in 1910, and died in 1926.\n\nDarien's mother died in 1869. His father remarried an Alsatian Protestant, Elise-Antoinette Schlumberger, born in 1839. Their daughter Jeanne was born in 1873 in Versailles and died in 1914. Strict religiosity of Darien's stepmother contrasted with the anti-clericalist views that he would come to adopt.\n\nFollowing an undistinguished baccalaureate earned at the Lycée Charlemagne in Paris, in March 1881, Darien voluntarily enlisted in the army for five years. Between June 1883 and March 1886, he served in a disciplinary unit, the Battalions of Light Infantry of Africa, in the Tunisian desert. His service there included a total of nearly a year of confinement in Gafsa, the Tunisian prison camp.\n\nIn 1889 Darien published his first book, \"Bas les cœurs!\", a satire of the impact of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and the Paris Commune of 1871 on a French bourgeois family living in the provinces. It was followed in 1890 by \"Biribi, discipline militaire\". As experienced personally by the author, the prison camp was not a mere penitentiary; it was the ultimate punishment that the French Army reserved for its insubordinates. The book inspired a campaign that succeeded, albeit only nominally, in the reform of prison camps. However, the Gafsa camp remained open until the 1920s, succumbing as a result of a campaign conducted by Albert Londres. The same year saw the publication of \"Les Chapons\" and \"Les vrais Sous-offs\", followed in 1891 by \"Les Pharisiens\", a fictional indictment of French antisemitism and its most prominent advocate, Édouard Drumont, and the only exception among the novels that Darien uniformly narrated in the first person.\n\nBetween 1893 and 1905, Darien frequently travelled to and resided in London. He embraced British culture and became a fluent speaker and writer of English. He also lived in Brussels and Wiesbaden. Many aspects of his life between 1891 and 1897 remain unknown. Darien's lifelong paucity of official earnings has inspired some of his readers to impute the fictional exploits of Georges Randal, the daring burglar protagonist of his 1897 novel \"Le Voleur\", to its author.\n\nIn 1899 Darien married Suzanne Caroline Abresch, born in 1863 in London, of German parents. In the following year he wrote his violent pamphlet \"La Belle France\". It was published in 1901 by Stock. In 1903 and 1904 Darien contributed articles to the anarchist periodical \"L'Ennemi du peuple\" until its demise, precipitated by his polemic with Charles Malato. He played a prominent part among the organizers and participants of the Antimilitarist Congress that took place in Amsterdam in June and July 1904. In the same year Darien published \"L'Épaulette\", which inaugurated the program of complementing \"The Human Comedy\" of Honoré de Balzac with his own \"Comédie inhumaine\". \"Gottlieb Krumm: made in England\". Written in English, this novel recounts the story of its eponymous narrator and protagonist, a nearly penniless adventurer who embarks for England with his wife and their three children after squandering her dowry in their native Germany. Krumm makes no secret of his character: \"I am not hindered by common scruples (if I am not familiar with them, it is only because I wish to have for them a lasting respect, and familiarity breeds contempt).\" Determined to make a fortune, he employs unorthodox means including arson, extortion, matrimonial swindle, and imposture. Krumm's unsavory stratagems yield spectacular success in the financial capital of the \"fin de siècle\".\n\nThroughout his early life, Darien disclaimed all political affiliations:\n\n(Quoted by Auriant.)Darien anticipated Louis-Ferdinand Céline by pointing out the convergence of the aspirations of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie towards their consolidation within a single class. His political idiosyncrasy gave way to an espousal of Georgism, which he discovered some time in the late 1890s. Starting in 1912, Darien vigorously promoted the Georgist ideal of a single land value tax through the \"Ligue pour l'Impôt unique\". Toward the same end, he involved himself in politics by running without any success in local, cantonal, and legislative elections of Paris.\n\nDedicating himself to theater, Darien saw \"Le Parvenu\" staged at the Bouffes du Nord, followed by \"Chez les Zoaques\", featuring young Sacha Guitry. His activities between 1914 and 1918, during \"La Grande Guerre\", remain unknown. Widowed and remarried, Georges Darien died on 19 August 1921.\n\nAndré Breton characterized Darien as \"A heart too big and beating too well not to knock in every sense against the walls of its cage.\" He described his writings as \"the most rigorous assault that I know against hypocrisy, imposture, stupidity, cowardice\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word \"giant\", first attested in 1297, was derived from the \"Gigantes\" () of Greek mythology.\n\nIn various Indo-European mythologies, gigantic peoples are featured as primeval creatures associated with chaos and the wild nature, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they Olympian, Celtic, Hindu or Norse. Giants also often play similar roles in the mythologies and folklore of other, non Indo-European peoples, such as in the Nartian traditions.\n\nThere are also accounts of giants in the Old Testament. Some of these are called Nephilim, a word often translated as giant although this translation is not universally accepted. They include Og King of Bashan, the Nephilim, the Anakim, and the giants of Egypt mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11:23. The first mention of the Nephilim is found in Genesis 6:4; attributed to them are extraordinary strength and physical proportions.\n\nFairy tales such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\" have formed the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent monsters, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat the livestock. The antagonist in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.\n\nGenesis tells of the Nephilim before and after Noah's Flood. According to Genesis 7:23, the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood, but Nephilim are reported after the Flood, including:\n\nThe Book of Numbers includes the discouraging report by the spies which Moses sent into Canaan: “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are. (...) All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.” However, the Book of Joshua, describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation, makes no reference to such people living there.\n\nThe Bible also tells of Gog and Magog, who later entered European folklore, and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath. While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative, he is much smaller than other biblical giants. The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, and the 1st-2nd-century BC Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath's height as \"four cubits and a span,\" approximately 2.00 m or about six feet seven inches. The King James translation of the Bible reports the giant Goliath as \"six cubits and a span\" in height—about nine feet nine inches tall, (over 2.75 m) ( KJV), but the Septuagint, a Greek Bible, gives Goliath's height as \"four cubits and a span\" (~2.00 m). For comparison, the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers. See also Gibborim.\n\nJosephus also described the Amorites as giants in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\", circa 93 AD, indicating that fossil evidence still remained at that time: \"For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had taken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men.\"\n\nIn Islam, giants known as \"jababirat\" or \"jabbirun\" ( \"tyrants\" or \"giants\"; singular, ) such as Jalut (Goliath) are mentioned, as well as ‘Uj ibn Anaq.\n\nThe Book of Enoch describes giants as the offspring of Watchers and women in 7:2.\n\nHayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state. Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the tower of Babel. Ancient historian Movses Khorenatsi wrote, \"Hayk was handsome and personable, with curly hair, sparkling eyes and strong arms. Among the giants he was the bravest and most famous, opponent of all who raised their hand to become absolute ruler over the giants and heroes.\"\n\nMount Nemrut is known to have received its name from an Armenian tradition in which Nimrod was killed by an arrow shot by Hayk during a massive battle between two rival armies of giants to the south-east of Lake Van.\n\nAccording to Baltic mythology, the playing of a giantess named Neringa on the seashore formed the Curonian Spit (\"neria, nerge, neringia\" means land which is diving up and down like a swimmer). This character also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a young strong woman, similar to a female version of the Greek Heracles). \"Neringa\" is the name of a modern town on the spot.\n\nGiants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living up the hills of the Basque Country. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old life style and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of San Martin Txiki, while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures (dolmens, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.\n\nHowever, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as jentilak and mairuak, while as individuals they can be represented as Basajaun ('the lord of the forests'), Sanson (development of the biblical Samson), Errolan (based on the Frankish army general Roland who fell dead at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass) or even Tartalo (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek Cyclops).\n\nIn Bulgarian mythology, giants called ispolini inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of blackberries which posed a danger of tripping and dying, so they offered sacrifices to that plant.\n\nIn Greek mythology the \"Gigantes\" (γίγαντες) were (according to the poet Hesiod) the children of Uranus (Ουρανός) and Gaia (Γαία) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the Olympian gods called the \"Gigantomachy\" (Γιγαντομαχία) when Gaia had them attack Mount Olympus. This battle was eventually settled when the hero Heracles decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like Enceladus, to lay buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nHerodotus in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes which was seven cubits long—around 10 feet (3 meters). In his book \"The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus\" Plutarch describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus, which was \"of more than ordinary size\". The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote Pausanias. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters, suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.\n\nThe Cyclopes, usually children of Gods (Olympians) and nature spirits (nereids, naiads and dryads), are also compared to giants due to their huge size (Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa, and nemesis of Odysseus, comes to mind). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus where they later made Zeus' Master Thunderbolt, Poseidon's Trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness during the Titanomachy.\n\nThe Hecatoncheires are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.\n\nOther known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed Gegeines, the northern Hyperboreans, and the cannibalistic Laestrygonians.\n\nIn Hinduism, the giants are called Daityas. The Daityas (दैत्य) were the children of Diti and the sage Kashyapa who fought against the gods or Devas because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Since Daityas were a power-seeking race, they sometimes allied with other races having similar ideology namely Danavas and Asuras. Daityas along with Danavas and Asuras are sometimes called Rakshasas, the generic term for a demon in Hindu mythology. Some known Daityas include Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. The main antagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana, Ravana, was a Brahmin from his father's side and a Daitya from his mother's side. His younger brother Kumbhakarna was said to be as tall as a mountain and was quite good natured.\n\nAccording to Jains, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth. Jain cosmology divides worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, \"avasarpani\" (age of descending purity) and ascending (\"utsarpani\").\n\nAccording to Jain texts, the height of Rishabha, first \"tirthankara\" of present half cycle of time (\"avasarpani\") was 500 \"dhanusa\" (longbow).\nIn \"avasarpani\", as the cycle moves ahead, height of all humans and animals decreases. The following table depicts the six \"aras\" of \"avasarpini\"–\nAccording to Paiute oral history, the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants, the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave. Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of \"beautiful giants\" who once lived between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.\n\nAdrienne Mayor writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book, \"Legends of the First Americans\". She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange.\n\nAztec mythology features the Quinametzin, a race of giant men created in one of the previous solar eras. They are credited for the construction of Teotihuacan.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the Jotun (\"jötnar\" in Old Norse, a cognate with \"ettin\") are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as frost giants (\"hrímþursar\"), fire giants (\"eldjötnar\"), and mountain giants (\"bergrisar\").\n\nThe giants are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the Fenrisulfr), and in the eventual battle of Ragnarök the giants will storm Asgard and fight them, until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the giants by many marriages, and there are giants such as Ægir, Loki, Mímir, and Skaði, who bear little difference in status to them. The Chief God Odin was the great-grand son of the Giant Ymir.\n\nNorse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions, which name is considered by some to share a root with the name Yama of Indo-Iranian mythology.\n\nAn old Icelandic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near Drangey Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \"Old Hag\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.\n\nA \"bergrisi\" – the traditional Protector of Southwestern Iceland – appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Iceland.\n\nSeveral Jupiter-Giant-Columns have been found in Germania Superior. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a Giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura and Alsace.\n\nIn folklore from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations. Saxo Grammaticus, for example, argues that giants had to exist, because nothing else would explain the large walls, stone monuments, and statues that we now know were the remains of Roman construction. Similarly, the Old English poem \"Seafarer\" speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants. Even natural geologic features such as the massive basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway on the coast of Northern Ireland were attributed to construction by giants. Giants provided the least complicated explanation for such artifacts.\n\nMedieval romances such as the Spanish \"Amadis de Gaula\" feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\", when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase tilting at windmills.\n\nTales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Celtic giants also figure in Breton and Arthurian romances perhaps as a reflection of the Nordic and Slavic mythology that arrived on the boats, and from this source they spread into the heroic tales of Torquato Tasso, Ludovico Ariosto, and their follower Edmund Spenser. In the small Scottish village of Kinloch Rannoch, a local myth to this effect concerns a local hill that apparently resembles the head, shoulders, and torso of a man, and has therefore been termed 'the sleeping giant'. Apparently the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Other giants, perhaps descended from earlier Germanic mythology, feature as frequent opponents of Dietrich von Bern in medieval German tales – in later portrayals Dietrich himself and his fellow heroes also became giants.\n\nMany giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity. A giant who had quarreled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel.\n\nOther English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other. This was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.\n\nGiants figure in a great many fairy tales and folklore stories, such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\", \"The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body\", \"Nix Nought Nothing\", \"Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon\", \"Young Ronald\", and Paul Bunyan. Ogres and trolls are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore. An example of another, Slavic, folklore giant is Rübezahl, a kind giant from Wendish folklore who lived in the Giant Mountains (nowadays on the Czech–Polish border). Additionally, mythological beings which are not necessarily considered giants in the common sense can be characterized by a giant-like body size, e.g. the Bergmönch, a German mountain spirit.\n\nIn Kalevala, Antero Vipunen is a giant shaman that possesses mighty spells dating to the creation. Epic hero Väinämöinen sets out to learn these spells from him, but Vipunen is buried underground, and when Väinämöinen digs him out, he is accidentally swallowed by Vipunen. Väinämöinen then forces Vipunen to submit and sing the spells out by hammering his insides. An analysis by Martti Haavio is that Vipunen is not physically large, but his familiar animal (astral form) is a whale. The depiction is not found in the majority of Finnish original stories, and most probably originates from the book's compiler Elias Lönnrot.\n\nThrough the centuries, certain archaeologists have searched for fossil evidence of a race of giants. Alleged evidence includes:\n\n"}
{"id": "314428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314428", "title": "Groupie", "text": "Groupie\n\nThe term groupie is a slang word in reference to a fan of a particular musician, celebrity, or musical group who follows this person or band around while they are on tour or who attends as many of their public appearances as possible, usually in hopes of getting to know them more. The term is almost universally used to describe young women who follow these individuals in hopes of establishing a sexual relationship with them or offering themselves for sex.\n\nThe word \"groupie\" originated around 1965 to describe teen-aged girls or young women who sought brief liaisons with musicians. The phenomenon was much older; Mary McCarthy had earlier described it in her novel \"The Company She Keeps\" (1942). Some sources have attributed the coining of the word to the Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman during the group's 1965 Australian tour; but Wyman said he and his bandmates used other \"code words\" for women on tour.\nA prominent explanation of the \"groupie\" concept came from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, which published an issue devoted to the topic, \"Groupies: The Girls of Rock\" (February 1969), which emphasized the sexual behavior of rock musicians and groupies. \"TIME magazine\" published an article, \"Manners And Morals: The Groupies\", later that month. Also that year, British journalist Jenny Fabian and Johnny Byrne released a largely autobiographical book called \"Groupie\" (1969). The following year, a documentary film titled \"Groupies\" (1970) was released.\n\nFemale groupies in particular have a long-standing reputation of being available to celebrities, pop stars, rock stars and other public figures. Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant is quoted as distinguishing between fans who wanted brief sexual encounters, and \"groupies\" who traveled with musicians for extended periods of time, acting as a surrogate girlfriend, and often taking care of the musician's wardrobe and social life. Women who adopt this role are sometimes referred to as \"road wives\". Cynthia Plaster Caster, Cleo Odzer, Barbara Cope (\"The Butter Queen\") and The GTOs (\"Girls Together Outrageously\"), with Pamela Des Barres, in particular, as de facto spokeswoman, are probably the best known groupies of this type.\n\nMusician Frank Zappa organized \"The GTOs\" in the late 1960s. The band comprised seven young women — Miss Pamela (Pamela Des Barres), Miss Sparky (Linda Sue Parker), Miss Lucy (Lucy McLaren), Miss Christine (Christine Frka), Miss Sandra (Sandra Leano), Miss Mercy (Mercy Fontentot), and Miss Cynderella (Cynthia Cale-Binion).\n\nA characteristic that may classify one as a groupie is a reputation for promiscuity. Connie Hamzy, also known as \"Sweet Connie\", a prominent groupie in the 1960s, argues in favor of the groupie movement and defends her chosen lifestyle by saying, \"Look we're not hookers, we loved the glamour\". However, her openness regarding her sexual endeavors with various rock stars is exactly what has enhanced the negative connotations surrounding her type. For example, she stated in the \"Los Angeles Times\" article \"Pop & Hiss\" (December 15, 2010): \"Hamzy, unlike the other groupies, was never looking to build relationships. She was after sex, and she unabashedly shared intimate moments with virtually every rock star — even their roadies — who came through Arkansas.\"\n\nDes Barres, who wrote two books detailing her experiences as a groupie – \"I'm With The Band\" (1987) and \"Take Another Little Piece of My Heart: A Groupie Grows Up\" (1993) – as well as another non-fiction book, \"Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon\", asserts that a groupie is to a rock band as Mary Magdalene was to Jesus. Her most recent book, \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" (2007), is a collection of wildly varied interviews with classic \"old school\" groupies including Catherine James, Connie Hamzy, Cherry Vanilla, DeeDee Keel, Margaret Moser, as well as 80s and 90s groupies including Pleasant Gehman, Patti Johnsen. Des Barres described Keel as: \"One of the most intimidating dolls ... a slim strawberry blonde who won the highly prized job of Whisky office manager after her predecessor Gail Sloatman met Frank Zappa and became what we all wanted to be.\" Keel was one of the few who stayed connected in Hollywood and with bands for nearly three decades. Des Barres, who married rock singer/actor Michael Des Barres, also persuaded cult actress Tura Satana, singer and model Bebe Buell, actress Patti D'Arbanville, and Cassandra Peterson, better known as \"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark\" to talk about their relationships with musicians.\n\nAlso according to Des Barres' book, there is at least one male groupie, Pleather, who followed female celebrities such as Courtney Love and members of the 1980s pop group the Bangles.\n\nDuring the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs, women would hang around the hotels of Clear Lake and Cocoa Beach \"collecting\" astronauts. Joan Roosa, wife of Apollo 14 Lunar Module Pilot Stu Roosa, recalled, \"I was at a party one night in Houston. A woman standing behind me, who had no idea who I was, said 'I've slept with every astronaut who has been to the Moon.' ... I said 'Pardon me, but I don't think so.'\"\n\nGroupies also play a role in sports. For example, \"buckle bunnies\" are a well-known part of the world of rodeo. The term comes from a slang term for women (\"bunnies\"), and from the prize belt buckles awarded to the winners in rodeo, which are highly sought by the bunnies. According to one report, bunnies \"usually do not expect anything more than sex from the rodeo participants and vice versa\".\n\nIn a 1994 \"Spin\" magazine feature, Elizabeth Gilbert characterized buckle bunnies as an essential element of the rodeo scene, and described a particularly dedicated group of bunnies who are known on the rodeo circuit for their supportive attitude and generosity, going beyond sex, to \"some fascination with providing the most macho group of guys on Earth with the only brand of nurturing they will accept\". Similar individuals are seen in other sports, such as the \"puck bunny\" in hockey, Baseball Annies and the \"snow bunny\" in skiing.\n\nRecently, in Irish sport, particularly in GAA sports the term \"Jersey Puller\" or \"Jersey Tugger\" has been used to describe females who are interested in players. The term refers to the pulling of a player's top. The term can range from who look to be romantically linked with senior intercounty players to local players playing for their parish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39077177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39077177", "title": "Ingeborg Beling", "text": "Ingeborg Beling\n\nIngeborg Beling was a German ethologist from the early 20th century who worked in the field of chronobiology. She studied at the University of Munich under the direction of Karl Von Frisch and is known for her research on the time sense of honey bees.\nIn her research, in 1929, she trained bees to come to a feeding station at a specific time of day, day after day. This contribution ultimately led to the discovery of the bees’ 24-hour biological clock. Because of this achievement, she was regarded as one of the first female chronobiologists. Beyond honeybees, much of Beling’s work involved studying behaviors of wasps, fly pupae, etc. Finally, she also did some research in pest control.\n\nBeling wrote in her widely cited 1929 paper, titled \"Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen\" (“On the Time Memory of Bees”) published in the Journal of Comparative Physiology, that the early observations of Forel, and Dobkiewicz promoted her to study the intriguing behavior of bees, termed \"Zeitgedächtnis\", or time memory. In her pioneer experiments, Beling trained a group of individually marked foraging bees to fly to a feeding dish, which was filled with sugar water only at certain times of the day (for example, between 4 and 6 PM). During the testing phase, the dish was empty throughout the day and every visiting bee was recorded. She found that the bees only visited the feeding station at trained time, even when the sugar water was removed. Specifically, Beling found that the bees can anticipate the food by showing up just a little early every morning. Further more, she found that bees could be trained to show up at the feeding station at any time of the day, and even for multiple times a day. However, Beling did report that the bees could only be trained to a period close to 24 hours, but not 19 or 48 hours as she tested. These results were still present when Beling controlled potential environmental cues such as humidity, temperature, light and radiation.\n\nBeling was able to show that bees have an astonishing memory of time. She found that this time memory is both rigorous (the bees consistently show up at the expected time) and flexible (the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day, even two or three times a day). Beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours. This 24-hour rhythm in bees has biological significance in that it is evolutionarily advantageous, helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day. The bees' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day, the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response. Beling’s research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal biological clock that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a Zeitgeber that she did not account for in her experiments.\n\nMuch of the early work in chronobiology was done in Germany, so publications were largely written in German. Some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today. The father of chronobiology, Colin Pittendrigh, critiqued these terms, saying that researchers in Munich have trouble letting go of these terms. He argues that ‘training’ and ‘memory’ do not capture the innate components of the behavior.\n\nBeling was one of the earliest chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees. Her work grew from the observations of previous scientists (Forel, Buttel-Reepen, von Frisch) and helped inspire further experimentation (Wahl, Renner). Standing on the shoulders of these researchers, Pittendrigh took the field of chronobiology to the modern era by studying biological clocks in fruit flies and is regarded as the father of modern chronobiology. \n"}

He was a prominent single-tax activist following the political-economic reformer Henry George. He was the great-great-grandson of the famous potter Josiah Wedgwood.\n\nJosiah Wedgwood was born at Barlaston in Staffordshire, the son of Clement Wedgwood. He was the great-great-grandson of the potter Josiah Wedgwood. His mother Emily Catherine was the daughter of the engineer James Meadows Rendel. He was educated at Clifton College and then studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.\n\nHe married his first cousin Ethel Kate Bowen (1869–1952), daughter of Sir Charles Bowen, 1st Baron Bowen in 1894 but she left him in 1913 and divorced him in 1919. Since divorce at that time required a guilty party, he agreed to take the blame and was found guilty of adultery and desertion of his wife and children. This led to criticism from the press and pulpit. More criticism was levelled after the divorce was final and he revealed that the desertion was a formality and the adultery staged. They had seven children:\n\n\nIn 1919 he remarried; his second wife was Florence Ethel Willett (1878–1969).\n\nProficient in mathematics, he joined the workshops of an arms manufacturer, Elswick. He worked for a year from 1895 as an Assistant Naval Constructor in Portsmouth before returning to Newcastle upon Tyne to head the drawing office of another arms manufacturer, Armstrong. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899 he was given the army rank of captain on 3 March 1900, and for three years commanded a volunteer battery of the Royal Field Artillery equipped by Elswick. He remained in South Africa after the war, spending two years as a Resident Magistrate in the district of Ermelo in the Transvaal. His studies of native land laws gave him an interest in Land Reform. Influenced by the writings of Henry George, he developed a lifelong belief in the Single Tax, advocating a tax on property to replace taxes on income and goods as a way of securing for workers the full reward for their work. He became president of the League for the Taxation of Land Values in 1908.\n\nHaving returned to England, Wedgwood was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at the 1906 general election. Though he stood for the Liberal Party, he made it clear that he would take an independent line in Parliament if necessary, in accordance with his conscience. He was re-elected at both the January and December 1910 elections, and that year was also elected to Staffordshire County Council, remaining a Councillor until 1918. He became disillusioned with the Liberals after 1910, when it became clear that the government would not honour campaign commitments to land reform and opposing vested interests. His disillusionment was increased by the government's reaction against the Suffragettes, whom he also supported. In 1913 he staged a filibuster against the government's Mental Deficiency Bill, which he saw as authoritarian and unjust. Over the course of two days in Parliament, he tabled 120 amendments and made 150 speeches in Parliament, sustaining himself with only barley-water and chocolate according to press reports, until his voice gave out. This campaign brought him to public attention outside of his own constituency and the Land Reform movement, and he became known as a leading backbencher.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, holding the rank of lieutenant-commander. He returned to mechanical work and was posted with the Royal Naval Air Service and Armoured Cars. He served in France in 1914 and was wounded in the Dardanelles Campaign in 1915, receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service during the landing at Cape Helles on the SS \"River Clyde\". It was while serving there that he met volunteers of the Zion Mule Corps commanded by Joseph Trumpeldor that would affect his views about British policy on Palestine. Back in Parliament he expressed concern at under-staffing and support for national service, though he also defended the rights of conscientious objectors. Later that year he was posted as an army captain to the staff of General Jan Smuts in East Africa. In 1916 he was part of the Mesopotamia Commission of Inquiry.\n\nPromoted to Major he commanded a Machine Gun company in the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade in 1916. In 1917 he became Assistant Director of Trench Warfare with the rank of Colonel. At the start of 1918 he was sent to Siberia where his mission was to encourage continued Russian participation in the war and to gathering intelligence on Bolshevik control in Siberia.\n\nIn the 1918 General Election he sought re-election. There has been some confusion regarding his specific affiliation at the time of the election. He was officially supported by his local Liberal Association and he was officially endorsed by the Coalition Government. This led to him being described in many sources at the time as a Coalition Liberal. However, during the election campaign he publicly distanced himself from the Coalition Government. His own local election campaign was minimal because he was not opposed. In his election address he stated \"I come before you, the same impenitent independent radical that you first elected in 1906\". This had led some to incorrectly describe him in 1918 as an 'Independent Radical' even though in 1906 he was classified as a 'Liberal'. The usually reliable FWS Craig, in his book the British parliamentary election results, 1918-1949 described him as an 'Independent Liberal'. However his status as an official Liberal rather than an Independent Liberal was subsequently confirmed when he attended the first meeting of the Liberal parliamentary party on 3 February 1919.\n\nIn 1919, Wedgwood took the Labour whip in the House of Commons and joined the Independent Labour Party. He enjoyed the freer atmosphere of Labour and the party warmly welcomed him, electing him joint Vice-Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party in 1921. Wedgwood maintained his reputation for championing new ideas and the interests of outsiders and underdogs. He supported a number of unpopular causes, including opposition to the reparations from Germany contained in the Treaty of Versailles. In 1920 he criticised the government's partition of British territories into Palestine and Transjordan, and continued to attack what he saw as its bias against Zionism for the next two decades. That year he also led a commission from the Labour Party and the TUC to Hungary, which reported on the extremely brutal treatment of suspected communists under the new authoritarian regime. He supported refugee causes in Britain, particularly that of anarchists from the Soviet Union, such as Emma Goldman. Most of all he became known for his support of the Indian independence movement.\n\nThere was tacit co-operation between Labour and the opposition Liberals in some seats at the 1923 general election, and Wedgwood ran unopposed in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Having been re-elected Vice-Chairman of the party in 1922 and 1923, Wedgwood expected a seat in the Cabinet when Labour formed its first government at the start of 1924. There was speculation in the press that he would be made First Lord of the Admiralty and some expectation that he would become Secretary of State for the Colonies or for India. Sidney Webb believed Wedgwood would prefer to become President of the Board of Trade, and was willing to step aside in his favour. However, Ramsay MacDonald initially offered him only the junior position of Financial Secretary to the Treasury. After some pressing, MacDonald gave him a seat in the Cabinet, but with the sinecure title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster rather than a departmental portfolio. In this capacity, he performed various de facto tasks in government. Later in the year, he was appointed Chief Industrial Commissioner, succeeding Arthur Henderson in a difficult position as the government's decision to maintain some of its predecessor's policies on industrial action caused much friction within the Labour movement. He was sworn into the Privy Council in 1924.\n\nHe chaired a Cabinet Committee to contemplate the use of the Emergency Powers Act against strikes in the transport industry. He took a strong line on a number of issues, opposing disarmament and the promise of a loan to the Soviet Union. He was also wary of the state undertaking public works purely for the sake of doing so, without any utilitarian benefit.\n\nAfter the fall of the government, Wedgwood publicly criticised MacDonald's leadership and Labour's reliance on civil servants. He sat on Labour's front bench in opposition, speaking on, amongst other policy areas, local government, where he encouraged Clement Attlee. He was not offered a position in the second Labour government. In March 1929, he became chairman of the House of Commons Records Committee. He began compiling a history of the Commons, a subject that consumed his interest. He wrote a history of Staffordshire's parliamentary representatives from the thirteenth century to the First World War, and two volumes of biographies of MPs of the 15th century. Wedgwood's work in this area led eventually to the establishment of the History of Parliament Trust. Throughout the 1930s, he continued to speak in the Commons on issues of importance to him, particularly the Single Tax and native resistance to colonialism. In 1930 and 1931 he was made Mayor of Newcastle-under-Lyme after successfully campaigning for the town to remain independent of Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nFrom the mid-1930s he was critical of appeasement and of limitations on the migration of Jews to Palestine (1939 White Paper) and of German refugees to Britain and worked tirelessly to help European Jews. The actor Heinz Bernard's life was saved as a result of a parliamentary question asked by Wedgwood which resulted in his being given a visa to Britain.\n\nIn the Second World War, he joined the Home Guard in 1940. In 1941 he toured the United States of America, putting Britain's case against Germany at public meetings. Whilst Wedgwood was in America, Winston Churchill offered him a peerage, inviting him to sit for Labour in the House of Lords. Wedgwood accepted, resigning as MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme after 36 years and becoming Baron Wedgwood, of Barlaston in the County of Stafford on 21 January 1942. The following year he died in London at age of 71.\n\nIn October 1926, Wedgwood, a devoted Zionist, visited Palestine and challenged the Mandatory government's anti-Jewish stance. In \"The Seventh Dominion\" he accused the British administration of hindering the country's social and economic development.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9922049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9922049", "title": "Madame Montour", "text": "Madame Montour\n\nMadame Montour (1667 or c. 1685 – c. 1753) was an interpreter, diplomat, and local leader of Algonquin and French Canadian ancestry. Although she was well known, her contemporaries usually referred to her only as \"Madame\" or \"Mrs.\" Montour. She may have been Isabelle (or Elizabeth) Couc, a Métis born in 1667, or perhaps Isabelle Couc's niece, who was born around 1685 and whose given name is uncertain.\n\nIn 1711, Madame Montour began working as an interpreter and diplomatic consultant for the province of New York. Around 1727, she and her husband Carondawana, an Oneida, moved to the province of Pennsylvania. Her village, known Otstonwakin, was at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River. The modern borough of Montoursville, named for her, developed on the east bank after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nMontour's son Andrew Montour also became an important interpreter in Pennsylvania and Virginia, as did his son John Montour. Some of Madame Montour's female relatives were prominent local leaders in New York and Pennsylvania, and have often been confused with her by historians.\n\nThere has been confusion about details of Madame Montour's life. She has often been confounded with her female relatives, particularly Catharine Montour, who was prominent in western New York. Historians have long attempted to separate fact from fiction and piece together her life from a few records and conflicting names.\n\nMuch is uncertain about Madame Montour's early life. In 1744, Witham Marshe met the \"celebrated Mrs. Montour\" at an important treaty conference held in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. When asked about her background, Montour told Marshe that she had been born in Canada to a French father. She said that she had been captured by the Iroquois about fifty years earlier (i.e. around 1694), when she was about ten years old, and that she did not remember much about her parents. She had been adopted and raised by the Iroquois, she said. She eventually married Carondawana, an Oneida war chief, with whom she had several children before his death in battle in 1729.\n\nIn 1974, historian William A. Hunter tentatively identified Madame Montour as Elizabeth Couc, a métis born in 1667 near Trois-Rivières, New France, in what is now Quebec, Canada. Elizabeth (also known as Isabelle, which was used interchangeably in French at the time) Couc was one of five children recorded for Pierre Couc \"dit\" Lafleur (1627–1690), a French-born fur trader and interpreter, and Marie Miteoamegoukoué (1631–1699), a Christian Algonquin woman. Hunter conceded that some of the evidence connecting Madame Montour with Elizabeth Couc was \"vague and contradictory\". He accepted that Madame Montour had been captured by an Iroquois war party around 1695, but if she was Elizabeth Couc, she was much older than ten at the time.\n\nHirsch and Sivertsen have explained the discrepancies by suggesting that Madame Montour was deliberately vague about her past; this allowed her to present a different account of herself in Pennsylvania as a genteel French woman, albeit one in Indian dress. Elizabeth (or Élisabeth) Couc apparently also used the name of Isabelle, the French form of Elizabeth; the two names were then interchangeable. Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch uncovered a record from 1711 that lists payments to \"Eysabelle Montour interpretress\", the only known reference to Montour's first name in an English document. Isabelle Couc presumably had an Algonquin name too, but it is unknown.\n\nParmenter and Hagedorn are among contemporary historian who have argued that Madame Montour was not Isabelle Couc, but rather her niece. According to this interpretation, Montour was born in an Indian village near modern Sorel, Quebec, around 1685, a year consistent with the story that she told Marshe. Her parents were Louis Couc Montour, who was the brother of Isabelle Couc, and Madeleine, a Sokoki (Western Abenaki) woman. If Madame Montour was born in 1685, her birth apparently went unrecorded, and her first name is uncertain. Her given name has also been represented as Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, and Madeleine.\n\nAs pieced together by Hirsch, Madame Montour was Isabelle Couc and led an eventful life before beginning her career in New York as an interpreter for the British. In 1684, Couc married Joachim Germano, with whom she had at least one child. By the 1690s she was living in Michilimakinac (present-day Michigan) with two of her sisters and their husbands, who worked as interpreters in the fur trading center. Isabelle may also have worked as an interpreter for Sieur de Cadillac, the local French commander. Cadillac would later claim that Isabelle led a \"dissolute life\", and had more than one hundred male lovers; some historians attribute his vitriol to some personal bias. When Cadillac moved the French garrison to Fort Detroit in 1701, Isabelle evidently relocated there with her new husband, Pierre Tichenet. She became involved with Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont; when he deserted the fort in 1706, she fled with him. Her experience in the northwest territory gave her more exposure to a variety of Algonquian and Iroquois languages, increasing her facility in each.\n\nPerhaps around 1708, Madame Montour married an Oneida war captain named Carondawana. (If Madame Montour was instead the niece of Isabelle Couc, Carondawana was probably her only husband.) The couple had a son about 1720 named Andrew Montour, who would become a well-known interpreter in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Iroquois kinship terms often described a woman's niece as her daughter, for example, so there is confusion about the identities of Madame Montour's other possible children. Another boy, Lewis (Louis) Montour, was possibly her son, or perhaps her nephew. \"French Margaret\" Montour, a woman often described as Madame Montour's daughter, may have been a niece.\n\nIn the simplified family tree chart shown below, the names in green are the two women who have been identified as Madame Montour. Andrew Montour is connected on the chart to both of his potential mothers. Similarly, because it is uncertain if French Margaret was Madame Montour's daughter or niece, the chart illustrates both possibilities.\n\n<br> \n\nThe first Montour to come to prominence was Louis Montour, who was Madame Montour's brother or father. Born Louis Couc, he adopted \"Montour\" as his surname in the 1680s. During King William's War (1689–1697), Montour and other Indians in Canada fought against British-allied Iroquois from the province of New York. At this time an Iroquois raiding party may have captured his daughter, who, according to some interpretations, became known as \"Madame Montour\".\n\nLouis Montour relocated to Michilimakinac in the 1690s, where he worked as a fur trader. After King William's War ended, he began to facilitate trade between western Algonquians and merchants in Albany, New York. He accompanied the \"Far Indians\" to Albany. This lucrative enterprise diverted profits from New France to New York, and promoted diplomatic ties between the Iroquois and the western nations. Officials in New France saw this as a threat. In 1709, during Queen Anne's War, Governor Vaudreuil had Montour assassinated.\n\nAfter Louis Montour's murder, Madame Montour emerged as his successor, identified as Mountour's sister and benefiting from some of the trust accorded to him. Although she evidently could not read or write, she was valuable as an interpreter, able to speak French, English, and several languages in both the Algonquian and Iroquoian families. With family connections throughout the region, she was also an ideal cultural intermediary. According to historian Jon Parmenter, Madame Montour's role as a \"behind the scenes\" consultant was even more important than her work as an interpreter. When Robert Hunter became governor of New York in 1710, Madame Montour became his personal interpreter and one of his most trusted advisers. They communicated in French. Her husband Carondawana took the English name \"Robert Hunter\" to honor the governor. He became \"king\" of the Algonquian-speaking Shawnee in Pennsylvania in 1714, and traveled between there and New York with Madame Montour for years, strengthening connections between them and the Iroquois.\n\nAlthough Madame Montour served as an interpreter through the 1710s, there are few records of her activities at this time. In 1719, she petitioned New York for back pay, although with Governor Hunter's departure in 1720, she may not have received it. According to historian Alison Duncan Hirsch, the wording of an official recommendation about Montour's salary \"has been misread to mean that she was asking to be paid the same as a man\"; rather, she wanted the pay of an interpreter, which was higher than that of a common soldier.\n\nAt some point, Madame Montour and her family migrated to the province of Pennsylvania. Exactly when and why she moved is unclear. She may have been traveling between New York and Pennsylvania as early as 1714, when her husband Carondawana was appointed as the Iroquois spokesman for the Shawnee living in Pennsylvania. By 1727, she and Carondawana were living at Otstonwakin, a village also known as Otstuagy or French Town. The site of previous Native American villages, Otstonwakin was located along the Great Shamokin Path, at the important confluence of Loyalsock Creek with the West Branch Susquehanna River, on the west bank of the river. The modern borough of Montoursville developed on the east bank after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nBecause of her cultural knowledge of Native American affairs and facility with both the Iroquoian and Algonquian language families, Montour was sought as an adviser by Pennsylvania officials and private traders. She first appears in the Pennsylvania historical record in July 1727 as an interpreter at a council in Philadelphia between Governor Patrick Gordon and an Iroquois group.\n\nMadame Montour and Carondawana had a close relationship with Shikellamy, a noted Oneida diplomat who benefited from the couple's cultural and linguistic expertise. In 1729, Carondawana was killed fighting against the southern Catawba, traditional foes of the Iroquois. After her husband's death, Madame Montour was gradually excluded from Pennsylvania diplomacy by Shikellamy and his colonial associate Conrad Weiser, who wanted to keep tight control of the province's relationship with the Iroquois. After 1734, she no longer appeared at councils in an official capacity. She retired to her village, where she operated a trading post and supply depot, and raised her son Andrew Montour to be an interpreter and diplomat.\n\nDuring the 1740s, Madame Montour met several Moravian missionaries who were evangelizing in Pennsylvania. Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, bishop of the Moravian Church, visited Otstonwakin in 1742 on his journey to Onondaga, the Iroquois capital in western New York. He delivered a sermon in French, during which Madame Montour reportedly wept. Montour asked Zinzendorf to baptize two Indian children, but he declined, explaining that the Moravians did not perform baptisms in a village without first establishing a mission there. \"She left me displeased\", wrote Zinzendorf.\n\nIn 1744, Montour attended the conference for the treaty of Lancaster, where she told her story to Witham Marshe, as described above. Marshe, like others, thought that Montour was a French woman captured by and raised among the Indians, rather than a métis of partial French ancestry. Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch has argued that the captivity story Montour told to Marshe was a fiction she created to reinvent herself in Pennsylvania, claiming her father had been a governor of New France.\n\nBy 1745, Madame Montour had left Otstonwakin and was living with her son Andrew on an island in the Susquehanna River near the Native village of Shamokin, which was settled by Delaware, Oneida and Siouan-speaking Tutelo. In March 1746, Andrew took her west, across the Appalachian Mountains to Logstown on the Ohio River. She was reportedly going blind by that time. This was her last appearance in the historical record, aside from a brief statement made by trader John Harris in January 1753: \"Madame Montour is dead.\" Exactly when and where she died is unknown.\n\nMadame Montour has numerous descendants, and many Iroquois people still carry the Montour name. Montoursville, Pennsylvania, which was founded near the site of Otstonwakin, was named for her. Montour County, Pennsylvania, and Montour Falls, New York, are just two of the places named for her descendants and relatives.\n\nMontour's role as interpreter and cultural go-between was continued by her son, Andrew Montour, who shared his mother's gift for languages. He worked as an interpreter for Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Sir William Johnson's Indian Department. Andrew Montour was appointed as a captain in George Washington's regiment at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. He was granted of land by Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He left Montoursville at some point and moved to what now is Juniata County before finally settling on Montour's Island in the Ohio River near Pittsburgh.\n\nMadame Montour may have had another son, Lewis (or Louis) Montour, whose Indian name was apparently Tau-weson or Tan Weson. He may have been her nephew rather than her son. Little is known about him. He served as a messenger, and was reportedly killed in the French and Indian War.\n\nMadame Montour's daughter or niece, Margaret, sometimes known as \"French Margaret\", became the leader of French Margaret's Town, an Indian settlement at the mouth of Lycoming Creek a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Madame Montour's village. Margaret Montour's daughter Catharine Montour also became a noted local leader, and many 19th-century historians confused her with Madame Montour.\n\nAT least four streams in Pennsylvania were named after her; see Montour Run.\n\n\n"}

Flores\n\nManuel Flores (Jose Manuel Nepomunceno Paublino Flores; ca. 1801–1868) served as a volunteer in the Texas army in 1835–1838. Fighting and commanding, he rose through the ranks to reach sergeant status during the fight for Texas independence and was commissioned a captain during the Republic years.\nManuel Flores was born in Spanish Texas on June 16, 1799, in La Villa de San Fernando de Bexar. He was a skilled vaquero and ranchero that lived on the San Antonio River below San Antonio. He married Maria Josefa Courbière in 1835. He married Margarita Garza in 1858.\n\nHe was the son of Jose Flores De Abrego and Maria Rodriquez They were a prominent family of Bexar, rich in the ranching history of Texas and steeped in the cause of freedom.\n\nSupporting the 1835–1836 Texas independence movement were four Flores De Abrego sons, Captain Salvador Flores Captain Manuel Flores, Lieutenant Nepomuceno Flores, and Private Jose Maria Flores, having participated in the Texas Revolution, serving at Bexar and San Jacinto. Manuel was the brother-in-law of Col. Juan Nepomuceno Seguín.\n\nAnticipating the Battle of Gonzales, a meeting would be held late in September 1835 at the Flores Ranch, that would organize a volunteer force of Texas ranchers that would favor the impending revolution. In Gonzales, immigrants, colonists, and Texian volunteers continued gathering. The Texian Army would become a mixture of all peoples, interested in the cause of democracy. Manuel Flores would be in favor, and volunteer his services to Texas. Manuel Flores would be the courier to inform Stephen F. Austin that Juan N. Seguin's volunteer company would join in at Béxar, against General Cos.\n\nThe attention of the commander of the Texian volunteer forces, Stephen F. Austin, now focused towards a Béxar campaign. Manuel and his brother, Salvador Flores, along with Manuel Leal, organized 41 volunteers from ranches southwest of San Antonio, where they reinforced the Texan forces on the Salado Creek, in mid-October, a few days after Juan Seguin and Plácido Benavides of Victoria had also gathered 70 men to aid Commander Stephen F. Austin. Manuel Flores entered the company with Juan Seguin elected as commander. In December 1835, after a two-month siege of Bexar, that finally ended in ferocious house-to-house fighting, Manuel Flores participated in the removal of Gen. Martín Perfecto de Cos at the Siege of Bexar.\n\nSeguin stated that he brought 15 men into the Alamo along with him. Lindley believed that the Flores brothers were defending the Alamo some time near the beginning of the siege. Manuel and the volunteers entered the Alamo on February 23. His brother had been one of the 100 or so that had served at the Siege of Bexar and remained in the Alamo with Colonel James C. Neill. At some point later in the siege, after Seguin's departure as a courier, the Flores brothers exited the Alamo, thus making them survivors of the Alamo siege. In 1907, Alamo survivor Enrique Esparza stated that Santa Anna called an armistice for three days and he remembers the Flores brothers leaving at that time. They had entered the Alamo hastily when the Mexican army arrived and now they took the chance to check on the condition of their families, who had been left alone in their homes. After securing the safety of their families, they regrouped and recruited a few more men from the area, gaining a few more Flores brothers. They then rendezvoused with Seguin in Gonzales. There, the native Texan defenders were joined by other men from Gonzales and proceeded westward to reinforce the Alamo. There, on the Cibolo, they waited to team up with Fannin's army. Fannin never made it to the Cibolo, thus the Alamo fell before they could reach it.\n\nA company was reorganized in Gonzales during the first week of March 1836, and Manuel Flores became Captain Seguin's first sergeant. This force would now split up. Salvador Flores formed the western rear guard and would maintain this position offering protection from Mexican and Indian attack, while Sergeant Manuel Flores, with his brothers and brother-in-law gathered their company to follow Houston eastward. This company blocked the Mexican army from crossing the Brazos river, preventing them from overtaking the Texians. Sergeant Manuel Flores together with Captain Juan Seguin, Corporal Nepomuceno Flores, Private Jose Maria Flores and their Tejano company would then join in with Houston and Rusk to overtake Santa Anna's army, in the rout at the Battle of San Jacinto.\n\nManuel Flores is credited for taking the lead in the final charge against Santa Anna's army at San Jacinto. Although originally a cavalry company, they would fight with Sidney Sherman's force as infantry. José Maria Rodriquez states in his book \"Memoirs of Early Texas\", that during the final charge, the Texans fired and fell to the ground waiting for a volley from the Mexican camp, but Manuel Flores remained standing and challenged the Texican Army to \"get up\" and follow his lead, for the Mexicans were running. They got up and pursued the Army, taking many prisoners.\n\nAfter the Texas Revolution, he was commissioned as first lieutenant in Company B of the Second Regiment of Cavalry. Next he was commissioned the captain of a cavalry company in defense of the new republic, participating in much the same way a ranger company would. In 1838 he established a ranch on the south side of the Guadalupe River near a natural rock waterfalls and directly across from Seguin, Texas. Being one of the larger operating ranches of the time, it was visited in 1846 by German geologist Ferdinand von Roemer, who described the home and the Flores Falls in his works \"Die Kreidebildungen von Texas and ihre organischen Einschlüsse\" (1852).\n\nIn 1842, San Antonio was overrun twice, by Santa Anna's forces. During March 1842, the citizens of San Antonio sought refuge at Manuel Flores Ranch in the city of Seguin, Texas. There, a counterattack was planned and Manuel Flores was a member of the party that pursued the army of Ráfael Vásquez. Even though his brother-in-law, Juan Seguin had also joined in the pursuit that chased the invaders from Texas, Seguin was doomed to be blamed for the invasion. The Flores ranch in Seguin would again become a base camp when General Adrian Woll attacked San Antonio in September 1842.\n\nIn later years, the Flores descendants were the ones to donate the land for the establishment of the City in Texas that bears their name: Floresville, Texas.\n\nA Texas State Historical Marker was placed at the Floresville courthouse during the 1986 Texas sesquicentennial. It now stands in honor to Manuel Flores and his family for their service to Texas.\n\n\n\nHandbook of Texas Online, s.v. \",\" (accessed April 27, 2013).\n"}

As a child, she studied under Catholic nuns. Because she suffered from polio, she initially wanted to be a pianist. However, due to her father's disapproval, she studied law at the University of Indonesia, receiving a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1975. Studying under Hamid Attamimi, the \"founder of the Indonesian Constitution Science\", she decided to stay in law.\n\nFarida received her notary public's degree in 1982. She later received a Master of Laws degree from the same institution in 1997, finishing her doctorate studies in 2002. She has also taken non-formal courses on law making in Leiden, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Boston, and San Francisco.\n\nFarida initially worked to draft legislation.\n\nShe first served as a justice of the Constitutional Court after she was requested to do so by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2008; she had previously been asked by eight different women's rights organisations, but had refused. She is the nine-member court's first, as of 2010 only, female justice. During the constitutional court's appraisal of the Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction, she headed the three member specialty panel. Of the three, she was the only one to question its necessity, saying that the law was \"open to too many interpretations, the definition of pornography [too] ambiguous, ... divisive and bound to be difficult to implement,\" and noting that traditional dances like Jaipongan could fall under its definition. She has also dissented in cases regarding blasphemy law and a quota for legislative seats for women. She was initially expected to serve until 2013.\n\nYudhoyono attempted to appoint Farida to a second term in 2013, though her reappointment alongside the appointment of colleague Patrialis Akbar was initially blocked by the Jakarta State Administrative Court. Yudhoyono's office appealed the ruling on behalf of the two justices, succeeding after the Jakarta High Administrative Court found that the petition against the two of them lacked legal standing for the challenge. Farida also served on one of three panels set up by the Constitutional Court to investigate former presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo's complaint in the Indonesian presidential election, 2014, serving on the panel alongside fellow justices Ahmad Fadlil Sumadi and Aswanto. The panels ultimately found that the claims of Subianto's campaign were mostly without merit.\n\nFarida is also a lecturer on legislation at the University of Indonesia; after becoming a constitutional justice, she kept the job because she feared that \"if [she did not] teach it would be tempting for [her to] not read or not learn anything new\". She is also a guest lecturer at numerous other universities.\n\nFarida believes that the Constitution of Indonesia guarantees equality between Indonesian men and women, but that its application has been lacking. She believes that the traditionally patriarchal culture has limited women's chances by limiting their educational opportunities.\n\n"}

He was the fourth child of Frederick Noel Ashcroft, a keen geologist and Treasurer for 18 years (1924-1945) and later President of the Royal Geological Society and of Muriel Ashcroft (née im Thurn) the niece of the explorer and Colonial Governor Sir Everard im Thurn.\n\nHe was educated at Bancroft School and then Eton College where he was King’s Scholar making his mark as a mathematics specialist winning various school prizes.\n\nIn 1940 he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, where, as a Natural Sciences scholar, he became Secretary of the Union in Hilary Term 1941. In June 1941, after only two full terms at Oxford, he was recruited by Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander to join Hut 8 at Bletchley Park.\n\nAshcroft joined Hut 8 in Bletchley Park in June 1941, two days ahead of Rolf Noskwith, and worked there until mid 1944, when he joined Newmanry (working on Tunny). He later worked in the Secretariat as Assistant to Nigel de Grey.\n\nWithin Hut 8 he made his mark and a major contribution to breaking the Atlantic and Mediterranean Naval Enigma ‘Shark’ (or Triton), as the expert on short signals. This expertise was particularly significant during the period December 1942 – June 1943 when, during the blackout that followed the introduction by the Germans of the fourth Enigma wheel, short signals became the route back into Shark (see Enigma in 1942). This work was considerably aided by the capturing of the short signal code books from German submarine U-559 by men from HMS Petard.\n\nAfter June 1943 Shark was broken on the 4 wheel bombes built by the US equivalent of Bletchley Park– OP – 20 – G.\n\nAshcroft left Bletchley Park in 1946. Following the end of the war he contributed a chapter on short signals to the Official History of Hut 8.\n\nIn 1946 Ashcroft returned to Magdalen and obtained a first class honors degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He stayed only two terms and left to join the Civil Service. He was assigned to HM Treasury on an accelerated career programme as one of their first post war administrative recruits. “He undoubtedly found in the Treasury both work and an environment very much to his liking and, had he lived, he would have travelled far. As an administrator he was, for his age, in the first flight, zealous and effective in all things he did, a first class draftsman and a tireless worker”\n\nAshcroft died from cancer in December 1949, so his civil service career was cut short. He was only 29.\n\nAshcroft’s funeral service took place at St Margaret's, Westminster on 17 December 1949, attended by Stafford Cripps, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and many MPs, colleagues, family, and friends.\n\nDescribed as \"one of the most vigorous and questing minds of his generation\". Ashcroft was a great intellect and conversationalist. A very good friend of Roy Jenkins, he was best man at his wedding in 1945. Definitely a Labour Party supporter, he was indifferent to social distinctions and differences of class \n"}
{"id": "50882376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50882376", "title": "Military career of Bhoja", "text": "Military career of Bhoja\n\nThe 11th century Paramara king Bhoja ruled from his capital at Dhara (Dhar in present-day Madhya Pradesh, India). The period of his reign is dated approximately 1010 CE to 1055 CE, although some historians believe that he ascended the throne before 1010 CE. Bhoja inherited a kingdom centered around the Malwa region, and made several attempts to expand it varying results. He managed to annex territories as far as northern parts of Konkan, but these territorial gains were short-lived. He fought wars against several of his neighbours, including the Chaulukyas of Gujarat, the Chalukyas of Lata, the Chalukyas of Kalyani (Western Chalukyas), the Chandelas of Jejakabhukti, the Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior, the Chahamanas of Shakambhari, the Chahamanas of Naddula, and the Kalachuris of Tripuri.\n\nApart from epigraphic records, much of the information about Bhoja's military campaigns comes from legendary accounts, including Hemachandra (12th century), Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" (14th century), Rajavallabha's \"Bhoja-Charitra\" (15th century), and Ballala's \"Bhoja-Prabandha\" (17th century).\n\nThe kingdom of the Chaulukyas of Gujarat (also known as Chaulukyas) was located to the west of Malwa, the Paramara territory. Several legendary accounts talk of a rivalry between the two kingdoms during the reigns of the Chaulukya rulers Vallabha and Durlabha. Some historians, who date the start of Bhoja's reign before 1010 CE, believe that this conflict happened during the early years of his reign.\n\nAccording to the 12th century writer Hemachandra, who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, Bhoja's predecessor Sindhuraja invaded the Chaulukya kingdom, but was forced to retreat by Chamunda-raja. Abhayatilaka's commentary on Hemachandra's work states that Chamunda later retired and set on a pilgrimate to Kashi. On the way, he passed through Malwa, whose king forced him to give up his royal insignia. According to Hemachandra, Chamunda returned to the Chaulukya capital Anahilavada, and asked his son and successor Vallabha-raja to avenge his humiliation. Vallabha set out against Bhoja with an army, but died of smallpox on the way. His army then retreated to his Anahilavada.\n\nThe 14th century writer Merutunga claims that it was Vallabha's successor Durlabha-raja who passed through Malwa on his way to Kashi, and Munja was the Paramara king at the time. However, this account is historically inaccurate, because Munja died nearly a decade before Durlabha's ascension. \"Sukrita Sankirtana\" by Arisimha and \"Sukrita-Kirti-Kallolini\" by Udayaprabha Suri, both written under Chaulukya patronage, claim that Vallabha defeated the king of Malwa. These claims are not supported by any historical evidence either. Only the fact that Vallabha marched against Malwa appears to be historically true, as suggested by the \"Vadnagar Prashasti\" inscription of the later Chaulukya king Kumarapala. This inscription claims that the king of Malwa felt a quake on hearing about Vallabharaja's march against him.\n\nDurlabha became the Chaulukya king around 1009 CE, so Vallabha's invasion of Malwa must have happened before this time. Some schalars, such as D. C. Ganguly and K. N. Seth identify Vallabha's rival as Bhoja, who according to them, had just assumed the throne of Malwa around 1008 CE. Other scholars, such as Mahesh Singh, believe that Bhoja's ascension took place after 1009 CE, and therefore Vallabha's rival must have been Bhoja's predecessor Sindhuraja.\n\nAccording to a legend mentioned by Hemachandra, Vallabha's successor Durlabha also fought against the ruler of Malwa. According to this account, Mahendra-raja, the Chahamana ruler of Nadol, organized a \"swayamvara\" (husband-choosing ceremony) for his sister Durlabha-devi. Besides Durlabha-raja, he invited the rulers of Anga, Andhra, Kashi, Kuru, Mathura and Ujjayini to this ceremony. Durlabha-devi chose Durlabha-raja as her husband. Out of jealousy, the other invitees formed a confederacy and attacked his contingent, while he was returning to his capital. Durlabha-raja defeated their combined army. The contemporary ruler of Ujjayini (which is located in Malwa) would have been Bhoja. The king was young at the time, so his participation in a \"swayamvara\" does not sound far-fetched. However, Durlabha's defeat of such a strong confederacy seems unlikely, and there is no historical evidence of a war between Bhoja and Durlabha. Moreover, the chief of Naddula was a relatively insignificant ruler, and it is unlikely that so many major rulers left their kingdoms to attend his ceremony at a time when northern India was under attacks from Mahmud of Ghazni. Therefore, this legend does not seem to be historically accurate.\n\nBhoja's first military aggression appears to be his invasion of the Lata region (in present-day Gujarat), around 1018 CE. Durlabha, the Chaulukya (Chalukya) king of Gujarat, had plundered Lata in 1018 CE. Soon after this, Bhoja also invaded Lata. Bhoja's victory over the ruler of Lata is attested by epigraphic records, as well as literary and epigraphic records, including the \"Prabandha-Chintamani\", the \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription and the Kalyan copper plate inscription.\n\nThe ruler defeated by Bhoja appears to be Kirtiraja, who belonged to a Chalukya branch, and whose Surat grant is dated 1018 CE. The copper-plate grant of his grandson Trilochana-pala states that his fame was taken away briefly by his enemies. According to K M Munshi, Kirtiraja was the vassal of the Western Chalukyas, but K N Seth believes that he was an independent ruler at the time of Bhoja's invasion.\n\nBhoja did not depose the Chalukyas of Lata: the epigraphic evidence suggests that the dynasty continued even after this defeat. Kirtiraja may have become independent after serving as a feudatory of Bhoja for a brief period.\n\nBhoja's invasion of Lata brought him close to the Shilahara kingdom of northern Konkana, which was located to the south of Lata. By this time, the Shilaharas had been weakened by a Western Chalukya invasion, and probably acknowledged their suzerainty.\n\nIn 1017 CE, the Shilahara king Arikesari was independent of Bhoja, as suggested by his 1017 CE inscription discovered at Thane. The Betma copper-plate inscription of Bhoja, dated 3 January 1020 CE, indicates that northern Konkana was under the Paramara control by this date. Therefore, Bhoja must have invaded Konkan sometime during 1017-1020 CE. Bhoja's conquest of Konkana was a first for a Paramara king in this region. He celebrated this victory in a big way by making generous donations to Brahmins. His 1020 CE inscription states that he organized a \"Konkana-Grahana Vijaya Parva\" (\"Konkan Victory Festival\").\n\nThe Shilaharas probably continued to administer Konkana as Bhoja's vassals. By the end of his reign, Bhoja had lost the control of this territory. According to D. B. Diskalkar, the Western Chalukya king Jayasimha II conquered this region from Bhoja. The 1024 CE Miraj inscription of Jayasimha states that after subduing the lords of \"the seven Konkanas\", he encamped near Kolhapur in order to conquer the northern regions. Diskalkar believed that the term \"northern regions\" here refers to northern Konkana, which Jayasimha must have captured some time before 1024 CE. The critics of this theory point out that the Miraj inscription only refers to a plan, not the actual conquest of the northern regions. Moreover, none of the Chalukya inscriptions refer to their victory over the Paramaras in Konkana, although they mention their other successes against Bhoja. According to P. V. Kane, the lords defeated by Jayasimha were the Kadambas of Goa. K. N. Seth believes that it was Jayasimha's successor Someshvara I, who evicted the Paramaras from northern Konkana, around 1047 CE.\n\nThe Chalukyas of Kalyani, also known as the Western Chalukyas, were the southern neighbours and bitter rivals of the Paramaras. Their king Tailapa II had defeated and killed Bhoja's uncle Munja. Sometime before 1019 CE, Bhoja formed an alliance against them with Rajendra Chola and Gangeyadeva Kalachuri. At this time, Jayasimha II was the Chalukya king. The triple alliance engaged the Chalukyas at their northern and southern frontiers simultaneously. The extent of Bhoja's success in this campaign is not certain, as both Chalukya and Paramara panegyrics claimed victory.\n\nThe Chalukya inscriptions state that they forced Bhoja's army to retreat. The 1019 CE Balligavi inscription of his feudatory states that Jayasimha was like a moon to the lotus Bhoja (that is, Jayasimha humbled Bhoja like a moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals). It claims that Jayasimha forced the Malwa army to flee the battlefield. Jayasimha's 1028 CE Kulenur inscription claims that he routed the elephant army of (Rajendra) Chola, Gangeya and Bhoja. On the other hand, the Kalvan copper plates of Bhoja's feudatory Yashovarman as well as the \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription of Bhoja's descendants claim that he defeated the Karnatas (that is, the Chalukyas of Kalyani).\n\nD. C. Ganguly believes that Bhoja achieved some early victories against the Chalukyas, but was ultimately defeated. Others, including D. B. Diskalkar and H. C. Ray, believe that Bhoja was defeated by Jayasimha after some early successes, but ultimately emerged victorious against the Chalukyas after 1028 CE. According to Georg Bühler, the struggle probably ended with some advantage for Bhoja, which might have been exaggerated into a great victory by the Paramara poets.\n\nSwati Datta notes that the 1022 CE Depalpur inscription of Bhoja records the grant of a village to a Brahmin named Vacchala. The record states that Vacchala had migrated from Manyakheta (which was in Jayasimha's territory) to Malwa. Datta theorizes that by this time, Jayasimha's kingdom was under attack from the Chola-Kalachuri-Paramara confederacy. The Cholas had previously attacked the Chalukya kingdom during the reign of Jayasimha's ancestor Satyashraya. During this invasion, they are said to have killed the Brahmin men and married off Brahmin girls to the men from other castes. According to Datta, Vacchala might have feared a repeat of this episode in case of a Chalukya defeat. This might have motivated him to seek shelter with Bhoja, who was reputed as a patron of learned Brahmins. Datta believes that Jayasimha was able to repulse the invasion by 1024 CE.\n\nA \"Bhoja-Charitra\" legend claims that shortly after becoming the king, Bhoja saw a play which depicted the killing of his uncle Munja by Tailapa. An enraged Bhoja launched an expedition against Tailapa, captured him, humiliated him and finally executed him. The story is historically inaccurate, as Tailapa died before Bhoja ascended the throne.\n\nThe \"Udaipur Prashasti\" states that Bhoja defeated a ruler named Indraratha. A king with the same name is also mentioned in Rajendra Chola's 1018 CE Thiruvalangadu and 1025 CE Tirumalai inscriptions. According to the Chola inscriptions, Indraratha belonged to the Somavamshi dynasty, and was defeated at Adinagara. The defeated king is identified with Indranatha of the Somavamshi dynasty of Kalinga, and Adinagara is identified with present-day Mukhalingam. Historians believe that the king defeated by Bhoja and Rajendra Chola was the same person. There is no evidence of Bhoja having led an independent campaign against Indraratha: he may have played a secondary role in the Chola campaign as part of an alliance.\n\nThe Ghaznavids, a Muslim dynasty of Turkic origin, invaded north-western India in the 11th century, led by Mahmud of Ghazni. The \"Udaipur Prashasti\" claims that Bhoja's mercenaries defeated the Turushkas (Turkic people). There are some legendary accounts of Bhoja's military successes against the foreign invaders identified with the Ghaznavids. However, there is no clear evidence to show that Bhoja fought against the Ghaznavids or any other Muslim army. Nevertheless, the legends suggest that Bhoja was not a silent spectator to the Ghaznavid campaigns in north-western India. The invaders did not reach Malwa during Bhoja's reign. So if Bhoja's soldiers did fight against them, the battle would have happened outside Malwa.\n\nAccording to the 16th century Muslim historian Firishta, Mahmud of Ghazni invaded the Hindu Kabul Shahi kingdom in 1008 CE. Its ruler Anandapala requested help from other Hindu kings. In response, the kings of Ajmer, Delhi, Gwalior, Kalinjar, Kannauj and Ujjain formed a confederacy with Anandapala. Mahmud defeated this coalition army. However, none of the earlier Muslim historians mention the contribution of other Hindu kings to Anandapala's defence, and therefore modern historians consider Firishta's claim as an exaggeration. It is, however, possible that some of these kings supplied troops to Anandapala. Since Ujjain is in Malwa, the king of Ujjain referred by Firishta could have been Bhoja. Some years later, Anandapala's son Trilochanapala was also defeated by Mahmud, and is said to have been granted asylum by Bhoja.\n\nMahmud attacked the Somnath Hindu temple around 1024 CE. \"Kitab Zainu'l-Akhbar\" (c. 1048 CE) by 'Abd al-Hayy Gardizi states that after the Somnath raid, Mahmud chose to avoid a confrontation with a powerful Hindu ruler called Param Dev. Mahmud was carrying back a large amount of looted wealth, which might have been his motivation behind avoiding a battle. He did not return to Multan via the same route he had arrived. Instead, he chose a more dangerous route via Sindh, to avoid facing Param Dev: he passed through a desert, where the scarcity of food and water killed a large number of his soldiers and animals. The 16th century \"Tabaqat-i-Akbari\" by Nizamuddin Ahmad and Firishta's writings also mention this incident. Firishta identified Param Dev with Bhima I, the Chaulukya king of Gujarat. However, this identification is contested by modern historians. Bhima had ascended the throne relatively recently, and was not a powerful ruler at the time of Mahmud's raid. In fact, according to Muslim historians, during Mahmud's invasion, he fled his capital Anahilavada and took shelter in Kandahat (identified with Kanthkot). Moreover, Mahmud defeated the Chaulukya army in January 1025 CE. The Muslim historians before Firishta, such as Gardizi and Nizamuddin Ahmad, mention the king of Naharawala (Anhailavada) as distinct from Param Dev. Unlike Bhima, Bhoja was a powerful and famous ruler at that time. Bhoja was also a Shaivite, and according to the \"Udaipur Prashasti\", had constructed a temple dedicated to Somnath (an aspect of Shiva). Thus Mahmud's desecration of the Somnath temple in Gujarat would have motivated Bhoja to lead an army against him. Based on these evidences, modern scholars identify Param Dev with Bhoja. According to this theory, Param Dev may be a corruption of Paramara-Deva or of Bhoja's title \"Parameshvara-Paramabhattakara\".\n\nFirishta also states that in 1043 CE, the Raja of Delhi formed an alliance with other Hindu kings to re-capture the territories lost to Mahmud of Ghazni. The allies expelled Mahmud's governors from Hansi, Thanesar and their dependencies. After a 4-month long siege they also took control of Nagarkot. Next, they unsuccessfully besieged Lahore for 7 months. The Raja of Delhi is identified with Tomar ruler Mahipal, but it is unclear who his allies were. Based on the Udaipur Prashasti's claim of Bhoja's successes against the Turushkas, historians such as K. N. Seth and S. N. Sen suggest that Bhoja was a member of this confederacy.\nA \"Bhavishya Purana\" legend also narrates Bhoja's campaign against the Muslims, describing him a descendant of the legendary kings Vikramaditya and Shalivahana. It states that Bhoja defeated several mleccha (foreign) kings after reaching the Indus river. During this campaign, he came into contact with a mleccha named Mahamada (a character modeled on Muhammad, possibly combined with Mahmud of Ghazni). Lord Shiva told Bhoja that Mahamada had been doing the work of the pishachas (demons). The poet Kalidasa, who accompanied Bhoja, turned Mahamada into ash with his chants and prayers. Mahamada's disciples took the ashes, and returned to the Vahika country, where they established the \"Mada-hina\" city (literally, \"without intoxication\"; identified with Medina). One night, Mahamada magically took on a pishacha body and appeared before Bhoja. He told Bhoja that the pishachas will practice ritual circumcision, keep beards but not topknots (unlike Hindus), and eat cows. He further said that they will use a \"musala\" (pestle) for their rites, thus explaining the etymology of the term \"Muslim\". Bhoja came home and established Sanskrit language among the top three varnas and Prakrit language among the Shudras. During his 50-year reign, Aryavarta (the land between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas) became a blessed land where the varna system was established. On the other hand, caste mixture took place beyond the Vindhyas (that is, in South India). This is an imaginary account not supported by any historical evidence.\n\nThe Chandelas of Jejakabhukti were the eastern neighbours of the Paramaras. Epigraphic evidence suggests that Bhoja, possibly aided by the Kalachuri king Gangeya-deva, launched an expedition against the Chandela king Vidyadhara (reigned c. 1003-1035 CE). The Mahoba inscription of the Chandelas states that Bhoja and the \"Moon of the Kalachuris\" (Gangeya), full of fear, worshipped Vidhyadhara, a master of warfare. This suggests that Vidyadhara defeated Bhoja's invading army. However, some scholars such as K. M. Munshi believe that the Mahoba inscription is merely a boastful exaggeration.\n\nBhoja was able to extend his influence among the Chandela feudatories, possibly after Vidyadhara's death. The Kachchhapaghatas of Dubkund were the northern neighbours of the Paramaras. During Arjuna's reign, they were Chandela vassals. However, Arjuna's successor Abhimanyu accepted Bhoja's suzerainty. The 1088 CE Dubkund inscription of Abhimanyu's grandson Vikramasimha states that the intelligent and illustrious king Bhoja-deva praised Abhimanyu's skills as a general.\n\nBhoja also launched a campaign against the Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior, possibly with the ultimate goal of capturing Kannauj. Kirtiraja, the Kachchhapaghata ruler of Gwalior, successfully repulsed Bhoja's invasion. The Sas-Bahu inscription of his descendant Mahipala states that he inflicted a humiliating defeat on the king of Malwa.\n\nAccording to the \"Udaipur Prashasti\" inscription, Bhoja defeated the Gurjara king. The identity of this king is debated by the historians. D. C. Ganguly identified him with a Rashtrakuta of Kannauj. However, no Rashtrakuta king is known to have been referred to as a \"Gurjara\". According to K. N. Seth, the Gurjara king can be identified with the Gurjara-Pratihara ruler Trilochanapala of Kannauj (whose last known inscription is dated 1027 CE).\n\nThe Gurjara-Pratihara capital was located at Kanyakubja (Kannauj). After their decline, the area around Kanyakubja was controlled by the Kalachuris and the Gahadavalas. The 1104 CE Basahi inscription of the Gahadavalas states that their king Chandradeva emerged as the saviour of the land after the death of Bhoja and the destruction of Karna's fame. Since the Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja had died more than two centuries earlier, \"Bhoja\" here must refer to the Paramara king. This corroborates the theory that Bhoja's influence extended to Kanyakubja.\n\nIn any case, historical evidence indicates that Bhoja could not retain control of Kannauj for a long time, if at all. In his campaign against the Gurjaras, Bhoja may have been aided by Satyaraja, a Paramara of the Vagada branch. The Panhera inscription of Satyaraja states that he defeated the Gurjaras, and received a fortune from Bhoja.\n\nThe 1046 CE Tilakawada copper plate inscription states that Bhoja's general Suraditya stabilized his royal fortune by slaughtering one Sahavahana in a battle.\n\nEarlier scholars, including D. C. Ganguly and K. M. Munshi, identified Sahavahana with Sahila Verman of Chamba's Mushana dynasty. This identification is not correct, as Sahila Verman's reign ended in the mid-10th century, much before Bhoja's ascension. Another theory identifies Sahavahana with Salavahana, a descendant of Sahila Verman. However, it is unlikely that the small hill state of Chamba could gather an army formidable enough to destabilize Bhoja's kingdom, located nearly 1,500 km away from Chamba.\n\nD. B. Diskalkar believed \"Sahavahana\" to be a variant of \"Chahamana\", and identified the defeated king as a Nadol Chahamana ruler. H. V. Trivedi disagreed with this theory, arguing that there is no philological connection between the two words. He theorized that \"Sahavahana\" is a variant of Satavahana, and may have been used as a generic term for the southern kingdoms (possibly the Western Chalukyas in this case).\n\nAccording to K. N. Seth, Sahavahana might not have been a king at all, as the inscription does not mention his title. He might have been a general of one of Bhoja's rivals, possibly the Kalachuri king Karna.\n\nThe various branches of the Chahamanas (Chauhans) occupied territories to the north of Bhoja's kingdom. According to the \"Prithviraja Vijaya\", Bhoja defeated Viryarama, the Shakambhari Chahamana ruler. Encouraged by this success, he also waged a war against the Chahamanas of Naddula (Nadol). But in this second campaign, his army was forced to retreat, and his general Sadha was killed in a battle against Anahilla.\n\nDuring the last years of Bhoja's reign, Jayasimha's son and successor Someshvara I invaded Malwa, and sacked his capital Dhara. S. N. Sen dates this invasion to some time after 1042 CE.\n\nMultiple Chalukya inscriptions dated between 1058 and 1067 CE state that Someshvara invaded Malwa, and plundered its important cities, including Dhara, Ujjayni and Mandapa. \"Vikramankadeva-Charita\" by Bilhana, a court-poet of Someshvara's son Vikramaditya VI, states that Bhoja deserted his capital Dhara, which was then sacked by Someshvara. \"Kuvalayananda\" of the 16th century philosopher Appayya Dikshita also appears to refer to this attack on Malwa by Kuntaleshvara (\"Lord of Kuntala\", presumably Someshvara I).\n\nSomeshvara's generals in this expedition included Gundamaya, Jomarasa, Madhusudana (Madhuva) and Nagadeva. The 1058 CE Nagai inscription of Madhusudana states that the Chalukya king burned Dhara and Ujjayini. It credits Madhusudana with forcing the ruler of Dhara to flee the city. A 1059-1060 CE states that Nagadeva was like \"a garuda to the serpent Bhoja\". A 1060 CE inscription names Gundamaya as the general who captured the Mandapa fort. The 1067 CE Hottur inscription of Jomarasa describes him as \"a flame of doom to Bhoja\".\n\nK. A. Nilakantha Sastri speculated that Bhoja might have become a Chalukya vassal as a result of this invasion. But this is not supported by historical evidence: Bhoja re-established his control over Malwa soon after the departure of the Chalukya army. Nevertheless, the defeat was a major setback for the Paramaras. It pushed back the southern boundary of the Paramara kingdom from Godavari to Narmada.\n\nThe Kalvan inscription, the \"Udaipur Prashasti\" and Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" state that Bhoja defeated the ruler of Chedi. These sources do not name the defeated king, but at that time, the Chedi region was ruled by the Kalachuris of Tripuri. The contemporary Kalachuri king was Gangeya-deva. \"Parijata-Manjari\" (c. 1213 CE) by Bala Saraswati Madana, specifically identifies the defeated ruler as Gangeya. A verse engraved on a stone slab in Bhoj Shala also suggests that Bhoja defeated Gangeya of Tripuri. The 1223 CE Dhar inscription of the Bhoja's descendant Arjunavarman also mentions Bhoja's victory over Gangeya.\n\nBhoja and Gangeya were once part of an alliance against the Chalukyas of Kalyani. It is not certain when they turned into enemies. According to one theory, Bhoja defeated Gangeya before his Chalukya campaign, in which Gangeya must have fought as a Paramara vassal. V. V. Mirashi believed that Bhoja may have subjugated Gangeya before 1019 CE. This is based on his reading of the 1019 CE Mukundpur inscription of Gangeya, in which the Kalachuri king is titled as \"Maharha-Maha-Mahattaka\". According to Mirashi, this title is not as high as that of the traditional \"Maharajadhiraja\", and therefore, it appears that Gangeya was a vassal of another king (Bhoja) by this time.\n\nA contradictory theory is that the two turned enemies after their Chalukya campaign. Based on an inscription found at Mahoba, K. M. Munshi theorized that the two remained allies at least until 1025 CE. Based on the 1028 Kulenur inscription, K. N. Seth and Mahesh Singh believe that the Chalukyas and the Paramaras did not fight between 1028 CE and 1042 CE (after which Someshvara attacked Malwa). They believe that Bhoja may have used this time to launch an expedition against Gangeya.\n\nThe Hindi-language aphorism \"Kahaan Raja Bhoj, kahan Gangu Teli\" (\"where is King Bhoj, where is Gangu Teli\") contrasts something very important with something very inconsequential. According to K. N. Seth, the term \"Gangu Teli\" may have derived from Bhoja's victory over Gangeya (\"Gangu\") and the ruler of Telangana (\"Teli\").\n\nThe \"Udaipur Prashasti\" also claims that Bhoja defeated one Togglala. S. K. Bose identifies this person with Gangeya's predecessor Kokalla II.\n\nAccording to Merutunga, the Chaulukya king Durlabha's son Bhima I had cordial relations with Bhoja during the early part of his reign. Bhoja, however, decided to expand his kingdom by capturing Bhima's territories in Gujarat. When Bhima learned of the planned invasion, he sent his diplomat Damara to Bhoja's court. A play poking fun at other kings was being staged at Bhoja's court at the time. In one scene, the Kalyani Chalukya king Tailapa and another king were shown in Paramara prison. The other king asked Tailapa to move to another corner in the prison, but Tailapa refused to vacate his place, calling it his ancestral residence. At the end of this scene, Bhoja sought Damara opinion on the script, expecting him to praise the witty humour. Damara replied that the scene was indeed witty, but reminded Bhoja that Tailapa was still renowned for killing his uncle Munja. Bhoja then abandoned his plans to attack Gujarat, and instead launched a campaign against Tilanga (ruled by the Chalukyas of Kalyani).\n\nBhima launched an expedition against the Paramara branch at Abu, some time before 1031 CE. Dhandhuka, the ruler of Abu, had to seek shelter with Bhoja as a result. Bhima installed Vimala of the Pragvata family as his governor in Abu. The shrine of Adinatha in Abu was commissioned by Vimala in 1031 CE, so Bhima must have defeated Dhandhuka before this year. According to Jinaprabha Suri's \"Tirtha Kalpa\", Bhima later restored Dhandhuka as his vassal.\n\nHemachandra states that Bhima was once engaged in a campaign at the Sindh frontier. Taking advantage of his absence, Bhoja's general Kulachandra sacked the Chaulukya capital Anahillalpataka (Anahilavada). After his return from Sindh, Bhima dispatched his soldiers to raid Malwa several times. Merutunga's \"Prabandha-Chintamani\" states that once two such soldiers - Aluya and Akoluya - attacked Bhoja in the vicinity of his capital Dhara, but the Paramara king escaped unhurt.\n\nKarna, the Kalachuri king of Tripuri and the successor of Gangeya, attacked the Paramara kingdom during the last years of Bhoja's reign, or after his death. According to a legend mentioned by Merutunga, Karna challenged Bhoja to either a war or a palace-building contest. Bhoja, who was an old man by this time, chose the second option. The contest involved construction of a palace of pre-determined height in the shortest time possible. Karna managed to build his palace in Kashi, while Bhoja's palace in Ujjain remained incomplete. The loser of the contest was supposed to accept the victor's suzerainty, but Bhoja went back on his words. Therefore, Karna, in alliance with Bhima of Gujarat, invaded Malwa. According to Merutunga, Bhoja died of a disease at the same time the allied army attacked his kingdom.\n\nThe historicity of Merutunga's legend is doubtful, but it might have some historical basis. The Nagpur inscription of Bhoja's grandson Udayaditya mentions that he removed the \"clouds of difficulties\" which had spread over the Paramara capital Dhara after Bhoja's death. It appears that the alliance of Bhima and Karna attacked Malwa shortly before Bhoja died or after his death.\n\nThe Vadnagar Prashasti inscription of the Bhima's descendant Kumarapala states that Bhima captured the Paramara capital Dhara. Bhima's victory of Bhoja is also mentioned in several literary works written under Chaulukya patronage, such as \"Kirti-Kaumudi\" by Someshvara, \"Sukrita Sankirtana\" by Arisimha and \"Kumarapala-Charita\" by Jayasimha. \"Kirti-Kaumudi\" claims that Bhima captured Bhoja, but generously released him and spared his life. The legends in these literary works cannot be taken literally, as they are not corroborated by historical evidence.\n\nSome historians, such as R. D. Banerji and H. C. Raychaudhuri, proposed that Bhoja died while facing a defeat at the hands of the enemy confederacy. According to Raychaudhuri, besides Karna and Bhima, the confederacy may have included Someshvara (Chalukya of Kalyani) and Trilochanapala (Chalukya of Lata). However, other historians believe that the Karna-led invasion of Dhara happened after Bhoja's death.\n\n"}

{"id": "480544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=480544", "title": "Nephi, son of Lehi", "text": "Nephi, son of Lehi\n\nNephi ( ) is one of the central figures described in the Book of Mormon. He was the son of Lehi, a prophet, founder of the Nephite people, and author of the first two books of the Book of Mormon, First and Second Nephi.\n\nNephi was the fourth of six sons of Lehi and Sariah. He is believed to have been born in 615 BC. Nephi and his family lived in Jerusalem, circa 600 BC, during the reign of King Zedekiah, until Lehi was commanded by God to take his family and flee into the wilderness. Before their flight, Nephi's father prophesied the impending destruction and captivity of Jerusalem by the armies of Babylon.\n\nNephi also mentions having sisters, though he does not mention their names or birth orders.\n\nNephi and his family left Jerusalem, traveled to the Red Sea, and then journeyed three days further into the wilderness, stopping in a valley by a river near the Red Sea. Some modern scholars have suggested that the location of their camp was near the city of present-day al-Bad, in the Tabuk region of Saudi Arabia, approximately South of Jerusalem. Lehi then sent his 4 sons (Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi) back to Jerusalem to get the brass plates. After successfully obtaining the Brass Plates, they were commanded to return to Jerusalem a second time to bring Ishmael's family for the purpose of providing spouses for Lehi's children.\n\nA powerful man named Laban was in possession of the Plates of Brass, a record kept by the Jews which contained their laws, customs, history, and lineage. Nephi and his brothers tried three times to get the brass plates from Laban. First, they sent Laman, who simply asked Laban for the plates. Laban tried to kill Laman, accusing him of being a thief. Laman fled back to his brothers, extremely upset. The second time, Nephi convinced his brothers to try to buy the plates using their abandoned wealth. Laban wanted the riches but wouldn't give up the plates, sending his servants to kill them. They ran for their lives and their wealth fell into Laban's possession. The four brothers hid in a cave. Laman and Lemuel started to beat their younger brothers severely. An angel appeared and stopped them, telling Laman and Lemuel that, because of his righteousness, the Lord had made Nephi \"a teacher and a ruler over them.\" Finally, Nephi returned to try one last time. Before he got to the house of Laban, he found a drunken man passed out in the street. The man was Laban. Nephi was then commanded by the Lord to kill Laban. At first, Nephi struggled with the idea, because he had never before \"shed the blood of man.\" The Spirit convinced him that it is better for \"one man to perish than for an entire nation to dwindle and perish in unbelief.\" Nephi followed through with the command and then dressed himself in Laban's clothing and armor. He returned to Laban's house and ordered Zoram, one of Laban's servants, to bring him the Plates of Brass. He then led Zoram back to where his brothers were hiding. Laman, Lemuel and Sam, seeing Nephi disguised as Laban were afraid and turned to flee. Nephi called out to them. When Zoram saw Nephi's brothers, he turned to run, but Nephi stopped him. Nephi promised Zoram \"that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go down in the wilderness with us,\" to which Zoram agreed.\n\nNephi spent eight years in the wilderness, facing many hardships, including the breaking of his bow which made it impossible to obtain food, and Nephi's elder brothers Laman and Lemuel rebelling against him and his father Lehi. Nephi's rebellious older brothers attempted to kill him on at least two occasions.\n\nFinally, in the land of Bountiful, Nephi is commanded by God to build a ship and sail to the \"Promised Land\" or the Americas. However, Laman and Lemuel do not think he should, saying, \"Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.\" They then proceed to try to throw Nephi into the depths of the sea; however, Nephi commands them not to. He does this by saying, \"In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him.\" The land of Bountiful where this occurred was likely somewhere along the coasts of present-day Dhufar, Oman.\n\nNot long after arriving in the Americas, Lehi died, leaving the leadership of their colony in Nephi's hands. His brothers Laman and Lemuel rebelled shortly thereafter, and the colony split into two. Nephi's followers named themselves \"Nephites\", while the others were dubbed \"Lamanites\". Nephites separate into the wilderness, where they begin building in the land of Nephi. Within twenty one years of arriving in the promised land, Nephi's people construct a temple. Under Nephi's leadership the Nephite civilization prospered despite occasional war with the Lamanites. According to the Book of Mormon, Nephi was revered by his people. Nephi's death is supposedly attributed to old age. Upon his death, the charge of keeping the sacred records of the Book of Mormon was passed to his brother Jacob.\n\nNephi is credited with several major contributions to Mormon doctrine and teachings. After his father received his Vision of the Tree of Life, Nephi received a similar vision and recorded it in more detail, including an interpretation of each element of the dream. The dream and Nephi's interpretation are quoted often by Latter-Day Saints. Nephi also saw and recorded details of the birth, life, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ – the first such relation to occur in the text of the Book of Mormon. An angel also showed him things similar to the vision of John the Revelator which is canonized in the Book of Revelation.\n\nNephi quoted extensively from the Book of Isaiah. Between the books of First and Second Nephi 18 chapters of Isaiah are recorded almost verbatim as they appear in the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nOne of the most often quoted Book of Mormon scriptures was penned by Nephi in the narrative of his exile:\n\n7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. (1 Nephi 3:7)\n\nNephi also recorded his thoughts on his own inadequacy as a disciple of Christ in what is regarded as some of the most beautiful prose in the Book of Mormon. Recorded in chapter four of Second Nephi, it was dubbed the \"Psalm of Nephi\". A portion of the passage is given below:\n\nAnd when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted. My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep. He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me. Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night-time. (2 Nephi 4:19–23)\n\nNephi is regarded by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a major figure in the Book of Mormon, as a prophet, political leader, and record keeper. A variety of individuals throughout the Book of Mormon were named after him, including all of the kings in the early Nephite civilization. Additionally, his people referred to themselves as \"Nephites\" – a name that would follow them through the entire 1000-year history given in the Book of Mormon.\n\nNephi is also used as a personal name amongst contemporary Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Nephi\" is uncertain, and disputed. As non-Mormon scholars view the Book of Mormon as a work of fiction, and do not recognize Nephi as a historical figure, the predominant scholarly view is that the name was selected or coined by Joseph Smith. Based on a non-Mormon or secular perspective, hypotheses for the name's origin include:\n\n\nReligious Mormon scholars generally believe that the Book of Mormon is historical, and therefore have proposed etymologies consistent with that view. For example, Mormon scholar John Gee theorizes that Nephi is a Hebrew form of the Egyptian name \"Nfr\". In Phoenician and Aramaic inscriptions of Egyptian names containing \"nfr\", the \"nfr\" element is rendered \"npy\", and the closely related Hebrew language would presumably transcribe the name the same way. Hugh Nibley has suggested that the name Nephi is related to the Egyptian Nehri. Some Mormon scholars have proposed that the name Nephi is related to the Hebrew word nephesh (נֶפֶש), which literally means the \"complete life of a being\" though it is usually used in the sense of \"living being\" (breathing creature). \"Psyche\" is the equivalent New Testament Greek word from which the English word soul is only translated. In the Greek Septuagint nephesh is mostly translated as psyche (ψυχή). Other Mormon scholars propose that the term is a variant of the Arabic and Hebrew words for prophet: \"Nabi\".\n\nIn \"\", adapted from First and Second Nephi, Nephi was portrayed by Canadian actor Noah Danby. Danby was a Lutheran and had never read the source material before playing the role. The portrayal was highly influenced by Arnold Friberg paintings of Nephi.\n\nThe film was rated PG-13 by American censors for \"a scene of violence\", having contained an image of Nephi with blood splattered on his face after beheading Laban. This image was removed for home media releases, and the film received a PG rating.\n\nThe film was widely panned by Mormon and non-Mormon critics.. The Austin Chronicle wrote\n\n\n"}
{"id": "396072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=396072", "title": "Paul Hellyer", "text": "Paul Hellyer\n\nPaul Theodore Hellyer, (born 6 August 1923) is a Canadian engineer, politician, writer, and commentator who has had a long and varied career. He is the longest serving current member of the Privy Council of Canada, just ahead of Prince Philip.\n\nHellyer was born and raised on a farm near Waterford, Ontario. Upon completion of high school, he studied aeronautical engineering at the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute of Aeronautics in Glendale, California, graduating in 1941. While studying, he also obtained a private pilot's licence.\n\nAfter graduation, Hellyer was employed at Fleet Aircraft in Fort Erie, Ontario, which was then making training craft for the Royal Canadian Air Force as part of Canada's war effort in World War II. He attempted to become an RCAF pilot himself, but was told no more pilots were necessary, after which he joined the Royal Canadian Artillery and served as a gunner for the duration of the war.\n\nHellyer earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto in 1949.\n\nFirst elected as a Liberal in 1949 federal election in the riding of Davenport, he was the youngest person ever elected to that point in the House of Commons of Canada. He served a brief stint as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of National Defence, and made a good impression. He was then named Associate Minister of National Defence in the cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. This post was short-lived, though, as Hellyer lost his seat when the St. Laurent government lost the 1957 election two months later.\n\nHellyer returned to parliament in a 1958 by-election in the neighbouring riding of Trinity, and became an effective opposition critic of John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservative government.\n\nWhen the Liberals returned to power in the 1963 election, Hellyer became Minister of National Defence in the cabinet of Lester B. Pearson. This was the most significant period in Hellyer's political career. As Minister of Defence, he oversaw the drastic and controversial integration and unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force into a single organization, the Canadian Forces.\n\nHellyer contested the 1968 Liberal leadership election, placing second on the first ballot, but slipped to third on the second and third ballots, and withdrew to support Robert Winters on the fourth ballot, in which Pierre Trudeau won the leadership. He served as Trudeau's Transport Minister, and was Senior Minister in the Cabinet, a position similar to the current position of Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1969, Hellyer issued a major report on housing and urban renewal in which he advocated incremental reforms rather than new government programs. He called for greater flexibility in Canada's mortgage loan system, and encouraged corporate pension funds to invest more money in housing programs. His approach did not meet with universal acceptance. Some provincial and municipal governments were openly skeptical, and Heward Grafftey, a left-leaning Progressive Conservative with an interest in housing, called for a more radical approach.\n\nHellyer's report also called for the suspension of the \"wholesale destruction of older housing\" and for \"greater selectivity... in the demolition of existing houses\". Grand urban renewal projects would come to an end as a result of his Task Force. Hellyer resigned from cabinet and the Liberal caucus in 1969 over a dispute with Trudeau over the implementation of the housing program.\n\nHellyer sat in Parliament as an independent for several years. After his 1971 attempt to form a new political party, Action Canada, failed, Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield invited him to join the PC caucus. He returned to prominence as an opposition critic and was re-elected in the 1972 election as a Progressive Conservative. He lost his seat, however, in the 1974 election.\n\nDespite this loss, Hellyer contested the PC leadership election of 1976. His views were too right wing for most delegates, and alienated many Tories with a speech attacking Red Tories as not being \"true conservatives\". He finished a distant sixth of eight contestants on the second ballot; Joe Clark won the leadership.\n\nHellyer rejoined the Liberal Party in 1982, but remained mostly silent in politics. In 1988, he contested the Liberal nomination in the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, losing to Aideen Nicholson, who had defeated Hellyer 14 years previously when he was a Tory MP in the adjacent riding of Trinity.\n\nIn 1997, Hellyer formed the Canadian Action Party (CAP) to provide voters with an economic nationalist option following the collapse of the National Party of Canada. Hellyer believed that both the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties were embracing globalization, and that the New Democratic Party was no longer able to provide a credible alternative. CAP also embraced Hellyer's proposals for monetary reform: that the government should become more involved in the direction of the economy by gradually reducing the creation of private money and increasing the creation of public money from the current ratio of 5% public / 95% private back to 50% public and 50% private.\n\nHis party remained a little-noticed minor party, and Hellyer lost bids for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1997 and 2000 elections.\n\nFollowing the 2000 election, and a resurgence for the New Democratic Party, Hellyer approached NDP leadership to discuss the possibility of merging the two parties into 'One Big Party'. This process was furthered by the passage of a unanimous motion at the CAP's convention in 2003.\n\nIn early 2004, after several extensions of the merger deadline, the NDP rejected Hellyer's merger proposal which would have required the NDP to change its name. Hellyer resigned as CAP leader, but remains a member of the party. Rumours that he might run for the NDP in the 2004 election proved to be unfounded.\n\nOn 3 June 1967, Hellyer flew in by helicopter to officially inaugurate an unidentified flying object landing pad in St. Paul, Alberta. The town had built it as its Canadian Centennial celebration project, and as a symbol of keeping space free from human warfare. The sign beside the pad reads: The area under the World's First UFO Landing Pad was designated international by the Town of St. Paul as a symbol of our faith that mankind will maintain the outer universe free from national wars and strife. That future travel in space will be safe for all intergalactic beings, all visitors from earth or otherwise are welcome to this territory and to the Town of St. Paul.\n\nIn early September 2005, Hellyer made headlines by publicly announcing that he believed in the existence of UFOs. On 25 September 2005, he was an invited speaker at an exopolitics conference in Toronto, where he told the audience that he had seen a UFO one night with his late wife and some friends. He said that, although he had discounted the experience at the time, he had kept an open mind to it. He said that he started taking the issue much more seriously after watching ABC's UFO special in February 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Ottawa Citizen\" reported that Hellyer is demanding that world governments disclose alien technology that could be used to solve the problem of climate change: I would like to see what (alien) technology there might be that could eliminate the burning of fossil fuels within a generation...that could be a way to save our planet...We need to persuade governments to come clean on what they know. Some of us suspect they know quite a lot, and it might be enough to save our planet if applied quickly enough.\n\nIn an interview with RT (formerly Russia Today) in 2014, characterised by Yahoo News as \"sadly hard to take seriously\", Hellyer said that at least four species of aliens have been visiting Earth for thousands of years, with most of them coming from other star systems, although there are some living on Venus, Mars and Saturn’s moon. According to him, they \"don't think we are good stewards of our planet.\"\n\nHellyer was an early investor in the \"Toronto Sun\". He also served as a syndicated columnist for the newspaper between 1974 and 1984.\n\nHellyer currently resides in Toronto. He has three children and five grandchildren.\n\nHellyer has written several books on Canada and globalization, including \"\", in which he promoted the merger of the CAP, NDP, and various left-wing activists to save Canada from the effects of globalization, as well as possible annexation by the United States.\n\n\n"}

Two years later, the ministry was expanded to include domestic trade within Egypt and was renamed the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). He has been described as the first businessman ever to hold a cabinet position in Egypt and as a reformer. On February 1, 2011, during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, Rachid traveled to Dubai. Following the downfall of the Mubarak regime, Rachid was tried \"in absentia\",\n\nRachid received his B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering at Alexandria University in 1978. He has attended a number of management programs in the United States, including the Management Development Program at Stanford University in 1983, the Strategic Management Program at the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1993, and the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 1996.\n\nPrior to joining government, Rachid had an entrepreneurial and multinational career. He established and grew Fine Foods to become Egypt’s leading foods brand. In 1991, a joint venture was formed with Unilever establishing Unilever Mashreq. He was later appointed as President of Unilever’s Middle East, North Africa and Turkey businesses based out of London.\n\nAs minister, Rachid was a member of the government's new 'economic team' tasked with delivering a program of reforms to open Egypt up to international trade and investment. As Minister of Trade and Industry, his mandate included liberalizing Egypt's industrial sectors, attracting foreign direct investment into industry, and creating jobs. He is responsible for Egypt's foreign trade portfolio, managing Egypt's network of preferential trade agreements (with United States, Europe, Africa and the Middle East) and growing Egyptian exports. Rachid also oversees Egypt's internal trade market and is responsible for the creation of Egypt's first Competition and Consumer Protection Authorities.\n\nAs minister, Rachid pioneered a new form of public-private partnership in Egypt by involving members of the private sector in the government policy formulation process. Rachid also worked to harmonize Egypt's industrial policies with its international commitments and thus enable Egyptian industrialists and traders to benefit from Egypt's existing trade agreements.\n\nDuring his time as minister, the following trade agreements were signed:\n\nThe Egyptian cabinet was dismissed at the end of January 2011, after widespread public protests against the government, and then Rachid no longer held a ministerial position.\nShortly afterward, Egyptian prosecutors froze his assets and prevented him from traveling, though he had already left the country by this time. Rachid was tried in absentia on charges of embezzlement and squandering public funds. He was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, and ordered to repay 1.57 million US dollars, approximately 9.385 million Egyptian pounds.. Weeks later he was sentenced to an additional 15 years in prison on corruption charges and fined an additional 1.4 billion Egyptian pounds.\n\nIn 2016 Rachid reached a deal with Egypt's Asset Recovery Committee after he was able to prove his finances and investments existed prior to his appointment to the Ministry in 2004.

Reiser supported squatting in the early 1970s and later the green political party Die Grünen. After German reunification, he joined the Party of Democratic Socialism.\n\nHis father was an engineer for Siemens AG, and the family moved several times because of his father's work; they lived in Berlin, Upper Bavaria, Nuremberg, Mannheim, and Fellbach. Reiser was never really able to feel at home in any of these places. Many of his friends said, when they were asked in an interview which was broadcast on the TV channel arte in 1998, that he started playing music to create a place where he felt at home.\n\nReiser was known by his friends as someone who had a very special mind of his own. For example, he managed to persuade his mother Erika Möbius that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography, which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to Berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world's first \"Rock Opera\" onto stage. His mother supported his musical and artistic ambitions since she had soon realized that he was an autodidact; he never learned things when he was taught by someone else. Thus he taught himself how to play cello, guitar, the piano and other instruments, wrote lyrics and poetry and later also assumed jobs as actor in some movies and TV shows or at the theatre.\n\nHe was awarded his nickname Rio as teenager from an eccentric artist friend of the family who invented the name \"Rio de Galaxis\" for him in an \"intergalactic youth ordination\". He kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from Ralph Möbius to Rio Reiser because he played a leading role in the movie \"Johnny West\" and needed a catchy artist name. He took the idea for the name Reiser from his older brother Gert who had occasionally used it as artist name before. The name makes reference to the main character of the autobiographical novel \"\" by Karl Philipp Moritz.\n\nAs an adult, Rio soon discovered his musical talents which opened a way for him to express himself, thus enabling him to overcome restraints he otherwise felt due to a certain, intrinsic insecurity or shyness towards other people. The ability to reach out to others—even to the unknown masses in a concert audience—through his musical performance was later often referred to as being the core of his special talent to touch his listeners, or even to \"build a relationship\" with each of them for the period of a concert.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Rio Reiser first discovered—and immediately became a big fan of—The Beatles at age 13 who represented the sound—and way of life—of the future for him and also inspired him to learn to play guitar, to compose his own songs and to form his first band. Later he preferred the rough, direct sound of The Rolling Stones. In reference to John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were usually credited as \"Lennon/McCartney\" with respect of the songs they wrote, Rio and his band colleague and best friend R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz) as composers of most of the Ton Steine Scherben-songs were often credited as \"Möbius/Steitz\". Besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the Sixties, Rio Reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks, German \"folk songs\" and traditional music and German singers such as Marlene Dietrich.\n\nReiser was unique among German rock stars of his time in being openly gay, although he didn't come out publicly until the 1980s. At the beginning of his career, Reiser sometimes felt misfit among the political groups and various movements which, in the early Seventies, did not strongly approve of homosexuality, but later gained more confidence while working with artists who were engaged in the newly forming gay movement of Berlin, including the gay performance group \"Brühwarm\" which recorded two LPs with music composed by Ton Steine Scherben.\n\nWhile he still went to school, Reiser became singer in his first rock band The Beat Kings. The band had been founded by R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz), a boy living in the neighbourhood, who had heard of Reiser's singing talents and had asked him to join the band after letting Reiser perform a few songs to give a sample (as R.P.S. Lanrue later claimed in an interview, the Rolling Stones song \"Play with fire\" tipped the balance). Lanrue, who was of the same age as Reiser, soon became Reiser's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support Reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death.\n\nAfter having quit school, Reiser left his then hometown, as well as The Beat Kings, to follow his two older brothers' call to Berlin in order to compose the music for their common project, the first Beat-Opera, which turned out to be, in the words of Rio, an \"absolute flop\". Nevertheless, Reiser stayed in Berlin, where he was later joined by Lanrue.\n\nAfter occasionally having toured the countryside with the theatre group \"Hoffmans Comic Theater\" (consisting in Reiser, his brothers and a group of friends), Reiser went on to continue theatrical projects in Berlin where he joined an improvisation theatre group which played scenes from the everyday life of pupils and trainees, thus adopting and reflecting the social problems among young people in West Berlin in the Sixties, as well as its tense and sense of imminent social change. The theatre was very successful with young people and toured through Germany until 1969. The involvement in the context of the student and youth movement—not only as musician and actor, but often in the political debates which were to follow the theatre performance as well, played an important role for Rio Reiser's development of political awareness and for his lifelong commitment—both privately and as musician—to liberation movements of various kinds, including, in particular, the left-wing political movement characteristic for the Sixties and Seventies (while he liked to put an emphasis on supporting the workers' and \"simple people's\" interests rather than the students' intellectual approach), the Gay liberation movement and later, the German ecological movement. His musical work to a large extent reflects these political influences and convictions and thus can hardly be detached from his political positions.\n\nIn 1970, Reiser recorded his first single with the band Ton Steine Scherben. The band name was chosen in a lengthy democratic decision procedure among the members, friends and supporters of the band. The original name idea was actually \"VEB Ton Steine Scherben\", but the \"VEB\" was soon dropped. The band name can be translated both as \"clay stones shards\" and as \"sound stones shards\", thus offering different approaches to interpretation (sometimes also understood as a political program) and, last not least, making reference to Reiser's favorites The Rolling Stones. In that same year the group performed their first public concert and recorded their first full-length record.\n\nThe band soon became very popular with the squatter scene, left-wing student and workers' movement and was invited to numerous political events to provide the soundtrack to demonstrations, parties and rallies across Germany which often inspired the audience to translate the message into action afterwards. Thus, many buildings were seized after the end of a concert, and the band often ended up sitting in some commune discussing the political agenda with their hosts. Reiser later revealed in his autobiography that he sometimes would have preferred to just get away with some nice person.\n15 years of touring, four more LPs and various film projects and collaborations with other musicians followed, including the recording of two children's records. Reiser lived together with the band and a large group of friends and supporters most of that time, first sharing a commune in Berlin. In 1975—after the band was tiring of the numerous demands and expectations by all kinds of political groups—the group settled down on a farm in Fresenhagen in North Germany which continued to be Reiser's refuge and place of inspiration even after moving back to Berlin a couple of years later. One of the band's most important and ambitious albums, the \"Black Album\", was recorded there.\n\n\"Ton Steine Scherben\" were musically very successful and, being one of the first rock bands in Germany which actually wrote and performed German rock songs, opened the door for countless successful German rock and pop bands to follow. Due to their refusal to adapt to the demands of the mainstream music business, as well as to financial mismanagement, a certain \"outlawish\" image in the eyes of the large radio and TV stations and a fan community which often forgot that the band had to make a living out of the music and would have despised any commercial ambitions, they were not able to translate their musical success and widespread popularity into financial stability.\n\nIn 1985, Reiser and the band finally split, partly due to a feeling that it was time to move on, but to a large extent because of a desastrous financial situation. Reiser had a large debt with the group, but his early solo career went so well that he was free from debt in a short time. His first solo record-album was called \"Rio I\" and included the popular song König von Deutschland (\"King of Germany\"). The album was produced by Annette Humpe, a renowned German music producer who had already produced Reiser's very first solo single, \"Dr. Sommer\", some time ago when he was in need of cash and had asked her for support. The song \"König von Deutschland\" became one of the few real hits of Reiser, has been covered and cited by many artists ever since and is still known among most people in Germany. Other hit singles of the first album included the love song \"Für immer und dich\" and the melancholic \"Junimond\". Reiser could not repeat the commercial success of the first album, nevertheless he released five further studio albums until his death, most of them highly praised by the critics.\n\nMany of his fans from the \"Ton Steine Scherben\"-days thought that he was selling out to mainstream, capitalist music business, and blamed him for becoming—at least for a period of time—a commercially successful musician. However, when listening closely to the lyrics, it can be noted that Reiser never abandoned his personal approach to music, politics, life and love, although the message was delivered in a more subtle way now. Reiser sometimes admitted that the objections to his solo music, even hatred by some old-time fans was a serious problem for him. Wandering on the edge of commercial adaptability, while trying to conform with the expectations of old friends, fans and political movements which he supported meant a difficult struggle for Reiser which sometimes drove him to despair and depression. At the same time, he continued to be a very creative, productive musician and song-writer who collaborated with other musicians and friends and underwent strenuous concert tours which often brought him close to physical exhaustion. One of the highlights of his career were two concerts performed in East Berlin in 1988 where he faced a sold out concert hall filled with young people on the verge of the revolution which one year later led to the collapse of the political system of the German Democratic Republic and the opening of the Berlin wall. Recordings of the concerts prove that the east German audience knew the lyrics of his solo songs, and in particular all of the \"Ton Steine Scherben\" songs which he performed by heart, even though the albums were hard to come by in the GDR.\n\nReiser wrote and performed most of his songs entirely by himself, although he was often accompanied by his longtime friend R.P.S. Lanrue who continued to support him as lead guitar player and also delivered many musical ideas, while a few of his song lyrics were also written by or together with his long-term partner Misha Schoeneberg. Reiser's sixth and last solo album, which was recorded in 1995, was called \"Himmel und Hölle\" (\"Heaven and Hell\"). The album was the last one which he was contractually obliged to deliver to his major music company, and both the musical approach as well as the lyrics imply that Reiser was about to return to a state of inner independence from the major business not only personally, but also in artistic terms, including a sound and concept which is often seen as more authentic than the previous studio albums. After the release of the last album, which was not strongly marketed by his company, even though praised by the critics, Reiser was preparing new songs which he would have produced independently again, the completion of which was interrupted by his sudden and unexpected death.\n\nSome critics say that Rio Reiser created a new image of a German folk singer; he was even called a \"Schlager\" artist, and a \"Volksmusik\" musician (sometimes translated as \"folk music\", but in a literary sense it means music of the people). To other critics, Rio Reiser was simply a singer in a rock band. However, Reiser sometimes approved of being referred to a Volksmusik musician, because he thought that this would simply mean he sang music for the people.\n\nRio Reiser died on 20 August 1996 from a circulatory collapse after internal bleeding at his home in Fresenhagen, where he was buried on his own property under an apple tree.\n\nHis grave was moved to Berlin in March 2011, because Reiser's heirs sold the Fresenhagen property.\n\n"}

He was considered one of the most dangerous criminals of his era by the authorities. Convicted with the murder and robbery of an elderly man at the age of 18, he was sentenced to 15 years in Arkansas State Penitentiary, but unlike a standard prison, it involved farm labour. He was given the task of shooting fellow inmates with a shotgun if they attempted to escape. He killed and disabled many prisoners during his time at the Arkansas Penitentiary, punctuated by periods of parole as a reward for his prison protection, and then re-offending and being sent back to resume his role.\n\nIn December 1934, Persful was convicted for kidnapping and robbery in Paragould, Arkansas and sentenced to 20 years, after which he was transferred to United States Penitentiary, Atlanta. Two inmates recognized him from Arkansas and word spread of his killing of fellow inmates and he began being severely abused. He was transferred to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary a year later but was recognized and continued to be tortured by his inmates because of his past offenses. In 1937, it was Persful who attempted to cut off his hands in sheer desperation of his experiences at Alcatraz and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was eventually sent to McNeil Island Penitentiary where he was again recognized and suffered much abuse from his fellow inmates, despite being heavily watched over by the prison staff. He was released in April 1948 and moved in with a relative in Gary, Indiana, never to be convicted of a crime again.\n\nAt the age of 18, he was convicted with the murder and robbery of an elderly man, and was sentenced to 15 years in Arkansas State Penitentiary, farm labor rather than prison; at Tucker Prison Farm, he was given the duty of \"high power\", shooting fellow inmates in the belly button if they attempted to flee from the fields. After shooting a prisoner who tried to escape, his sentence was reduced to 9 years but he was almost immediately released on parole. About 18 months later, he was indicted for shooting a woman in the back with a shotgun but was never tried for attempted murder. Back at the prison farm, he resumed his position and shot another prisoner attempting to escape and was paroled again as a reward. After several months, he committed an armed robbery and was sentenced to 5 years in the penitentiary, but again resumed his \"high power\" position, during which he killed one and permanently crippled three others who attempted to flee. A circuit judge refused him parole but after he killed four prisoners attempting to escape in October 1933, he was released on parole for a fourth time 8 months later. \n\nIn December 1934, Persful was convicted for the kidnapping of a nightwatchman in Paragould, Arkansas and robbing the Schug Brothers of some $1000 with his companion Riley Gunn before being caught in Osceola, Missouri. He was sent to United States Penitentiary, Atlanta to serve twenty years. Despite Atlanta's reputation as a prison where inmates stuck together, two convicts knew Persful from the Arkansas penitentiary and word spread of his killing and maiming of fellow prisoners and of his shooting a woman in the back, and he began being severely beaten and bullied by his fellow inmates. The Atlanta prison officials eventually learned of the frequent abuse and violence facing Persful, and in December 1935 sent him to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. However, he continued to be unpopular with the inmates, many of whom had transferred to Alcatraz from Atlanta and knew of his history.\n\nOnce he was shifted to the Alcatraz prison, his heinous crime in Tucker, Arkansas of murdering a female prisoner who was pregnant, to camouflage rape, was also exposed. Once his misdeed was exposed by the prison doctor, the issue became a widely publicized national scandal involving murders of inmates by other inmates and this brought Homer Stille Cummings, the US Attorney General and J. Edgar Hoover, FBI Director to Alcatraz twice to verify the issue and cross check with Carl Janaway who was also his inmate at Tucker and had been attacked by Rufe Persful.\n\nHe was involved in a brutal fight with Francis Keating, a former inmate of Atlanta who called him a \"shotgun son of a bitch\" and Persful was sent to solitary confinement in D-Block. Persful became one of the most guarded inmates of Alcatraz due to his reputation and was carefully watched during dining to ensure he was not assaulted by his fellow inmates. Nonetheless, Persful continued to be heavily abused and in fear of his life, in September 1936 he sent a letter to James A. Johnston, the prison warden, informing him of what was common knowledge in the prison of his past exploits and why the fellow inmates resented him, asking for a transfer to McNeil Island. His request was rejected.\n\nRufe's paranoia, while in Alcatraz, was also due the strict silence enforced there by Warden Johnston; the silence rule was resented by many other inmates also. As a result, some nine months later (after his request for transfer to McNeil Island was rejected) during the course of duties when he was working in the garage area to sweep and clean trash he took out an axe from a fire truck parked in the building and cut off four fingers of the left hand to seek attention and get transferred to the medical center in Springfield, Missouri on grounds of insanity. The guard and another inmate took away the hatchet from Rufes and put a tourniquet on his wrist to stop the bleeding. He was said to have grinned maniacally as he sliced his four fingers off. Persful was taken to the prison hospital, where he had to be forcibly restrained as the staff treated him, as he had a desire to cut off his other hand and his feet. However the sequence of this incident is disputed as it is also mentioned that Persful's fingers were cut off due to his hand getting jammed while closing the workshop door.\nIn the 1979, Don Siegel-Clint Eastwood film \"Escape from Alcatraz\", Persful's hand mutilation was enacted in the movie. This scene is disputed due to the fact that the lead up to the June 1962 escape from Alcatraz actually took place nearly 25 years later, and neither Frank Morris or Clarence and John Anglin were imprisoned at Alcatraz when the Persful incident occurred. Following this incident a policy change (one of the very few made during the history of the prison) in the prison rules of Alcatraz regarding silence was made for the good. As the incident received publicity in the news media, James V. Bennett, the then Director of the Bureau of Prisons, clarified that the incident was of mental derangement of Rufes.\n\nIn the months following the mutilation incident, Persful's mental health continued to decline; he would frequently complain of there being an alligator living in his cell and he attempted to make nooses out of bed linen and towels to hang himself. He was assessed by the prison psychiatrist to be suffering from \"Dementia praecox\", hebephrenic type and in January 1938 he was sent to Springfield Medical Centre via Fort Leavenworth. He was also called the most \"wanton killer\" as his killings covered six men, his wife and child and probably many more. It is also conjectured that he killed three men purposely as they were black prisoners.\n\nHe was transferred then to McNeil where he was heavily booed in the dining hall just days after arriving as the word quickly got out of his history amongst inmates. He was closely monitored by guards at McNeil Island, and his job was to clean the cells after the inmates had departed on their own tasks to avoid confrontation with them. In November 1941, the warden of McNeil requested a transfer back to Alcatraz in confinement in D-Block, but it was declined due to him likely becoming insane again. Several months later attempts were made to place him in a group cell at McNeil but his cell mates warned staff that they would murder him, so he was sent back to his single cell. Persful was beaten 18 months later when a fellow prisoner was given access to his cell during his cleaning duties, after which Persful requested permanent locking inside his cell for the rest of the duration of his sentence. The warden declined his request and he was beaten a further two times when security relapsed before being released from prison in April 1948.\n\nAfter release from prison, Persful moved in with a relative in Gary, Indiana, and, scarred both emotionally and physically by his torturous prison experiences, was never convicted of a crime for the rest of his life. He died in 1991.\n"}

In 2006, Sloan served on the Executive Board of the United States Chess Federation. In 2006 Sloan was elected as an officer to the Manhattan Libertarian Party County Committee as Director of Media Relations.\nIn 1970, Sloan established a registered broker-dealer that traded over-the-counter stocks and bonds. Sloan had no formal legal training but orally argued a case before the Supreme Court after litigating against the Securities and Exchange Commission over policies regarding the trading of penny stocks. The Court ruled in his favor, 9–0. Sloan is the last non-lawyer to argue before the court.\nHe has run unsuccessfully or attempted to run for several other city, state and national government political offices, including for President of the United States.\n\nSloan was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1944 to attorney Leroy Bayfield Sloan, who was a Special agent in the Audit Division of the Internal Revenue Service and to child psychiatrist Dr. Marjorie Jacobson Sloan. His family later moved to Lynchburg, where he graduated from E.C. Glass High School. Sloan studied chess from an early age.\n\nSloan left Lynchburg in 1962 to study at University of California, Berkeley; he majored in mathematics and later switched to criminology, but he left Berkeley in 1967 and did not graduate. At Berkeley he became one of the leaders of the Anti-War movement and promoted a branch of the Sexual Freedom League. He held more than forty sexually liberal parties in Berkeley.\n\nAfter leaving Berkeley, Sloan worked two years for the Wall Street investment banking firm of Hayden, Stone & Co. in the over-the-counter trading department. In 1970, he established Samuel H. Sloan & Company, a registered broker-dealer primarily trading over-the-counter stocks and bonds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought civil actions against Sloan & Co. in 1971–5 alleging he had failed to maintain adequate books and records. In 1975, the SEC revoked Sloan's broker-dealer registration. After years of litigation, Sloan in 1978 prevailed in the U.S. Supreme Court. Sloan argued the case \"pro se\". The opposing attorney was Harvey Pitt, who was later Chairman of the SEC from 2001 to 2003. Sloan won before the U.S. Supreme Court 9–0, concerning his claim that the \"tacking\" of 10-day summary suspension orders for an indefinite period was an abuse of the agency's authority and a deprivation of due process. Sloan is the last non-lawyer to argue before the court.\n\nSloan has written in 1981 a lexicon of Khowar, a language spoken in Chitral, Pakistan. Sloan had a minor role in a 1984 commercially produced film, \"Mahjong hōrōki\", that later became a video game, \"Mahjong Hōrōki Classic\". Since 1994, Sloan has operated Ishi Press.\n\nSloan is a chess journalist and author. He claims to have traveled to 78 countries, primarily attending chess tournaments. During a speech on April 29, 2006 at a Libertarian Party of New York's convention Sam Sloan has claimed to have \"won the World Championship of Chinese Chess in Beijing, China, in 1988\". He is rated an FM (Federation Master) by the World Xiangqi Association. Sloan has competed in tournaments in Thai (Makrook) and Japanese (Shōgi) chess.\n\nIn July 2006, Sloan was elected to the Executive Board of the United States Chess Federation (USCF). He advocated a major expansion of scholastic chess, stating that the USCF should establish a program to certify school chess teachers. He criticized the USCF's recent move from New Windsor, New York to Crossville, Tennessee. As second-place finisher (out of five) in the special election, Sloan was elected to a one-year term on the board (the first-place finisher received a three-year term). Sloan's term of service began in August 2006. In 2007, Sloan ran for reelection to the USCF Executive Board, but was unsuccessful, finishing a distant ninth out of ten candidates. On October 2, 2007, Sloan filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to overturn the results of the 2007 USCF election, and alleging that more than 2,000 obscene \"Fake Sam Sloan\" newsgroup postings prior to the election had been made by a rival candidate. On August 28, 2008, US District Judge Denny Chin dismissed the suit with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal but modified it, saying that it was \"without prejudice\" as the case had not gone to a hearing.\n\nOn April 3, 2008, posts appeared on USENET, apparently placed by Sloan, claiming that some of his websites had been closed down by law enforcement in Amherst County, Virginia, apparently because Sloan listed the home addresses of parties involved in his long-running but moot child custody dispute involving his daughter. The USENET posting mentions County investigator Christopher Smith. During that same time, Smith was conducting a broad campaign against Internet crime in the State.\n\nIn a 2011 book about Bobby Fischer, Frank Brady wrote \"Aided by an eidetic memory, [Sloan] was the last non-lawyer to argue a case before the United States Supreme Court – a case he won. Bobby trusted him.\"\n\nThree dialogues with Sloan are incorporated in the 2011 documentary \"Bobby Fischer Against the World\".\n\nSloan tied for the lead in the 3rd round of the 2011 World Championship of Chinese Chess (the total number of rounds or his final result was not stated).\n\nSloan won the 2011 Silver Medal in Senior Division (of two entries) at the World Memory Championship in Guangzhou, China.\n\nSloan competed in the World Championship of Chinese Chess in 2011 and 2013 and 2015 and 2017, held in Jakarta, and in Huizhou, China and in Munich, Germany and in Manila, Philippines respectively.\n\nIn an April 30, 2006, email to Michael Badnarik's 2004 presidential campaign mailing list, an individual claiming to be Sloan announced his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination for Governor of New York State. From 2002 to 2006, Sloan had been active in the Libertarian Party of New York attempting to influence its policy agenda and candidate nominations.\n\nLater in 2006, Sloan was elected as an officer to the Manhattan Libertarian Party County Committee as Director of Media Relations. He was not re-elected to that position in 2007. He was a delegate to the 2008 Libertarian National Convention and the 2010 Libertarian National Convention. On May 25, 2008 in Denver, Colorado, Sloan was nominated to the National Committee of the Libertarian Party and made a speech addressing the Libertarian National Convention.\n\nSloan made a bid for governor in the New York gubernatorial election, 2010, facing off against attorney Warren Redlich and former madam Kristin M. Davis. Sloan, by his own admission, was not popular within the Libertarian Party of New York and did not expect to win the nomination. He testified that a faction in the party who opposed Redlich's nomination needed another candidate. Sloan eventually lost the nomination to Redlich in a two-way battle, by a vote of 27 for Redlich and 17 for Sloan, after Davis refused to show up at the convention. Despite his failure to secure the nomination, Sloan was the first to submit petitions to the board of elections with the Libertarian Party line, which effectively gives him the nomination; the down-ballot selections on Sloan's petitions are identical to those confirmed by the party committee. However, because his petitions failed to contain the requisite 15,000 signatures, the nomination went to Redlich; it has been speculated that Sloan used the ploy to file a lawsuit against Redlich in his long-running dispute with the state Libertarian Party. Prior to the November elections, Roger Stone Davis's campaign manager, claims that Sloan fed him information that Stone passed on to a group entitled \"People for a Safer New York\", who created a flyer labeling Redlich a \"sexual predator\".\n\nIn January 2012, Sloan announced his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2012 presidential nomination. He lost the nomination to Gary Johnson.\n\nIn November 2013, Sloan was on the ballot for the New York City mayoral election, 2013, as an independent under the \"War Veterans\" line; he received 166 votes (0.02%, or 1/5,000 of the total vote).\n\nIn June 2014, Sloan ran for the Democratic nomination for New York's 15th congressional district, against incumbent José E. Serrano. He lost the primary election by 91% to 9%. Later that summer, Sloan attempted to submit petitions for the 2014 gubernatorial election, one for the Democratic primary (with Nenad Bach as the running mate) and another an \"ambush\" of the Libertarian Party line similar to the one he attempted in 2010 (with Tom Stevens as the running mate). Both petitions were ruled invalid.\n\nOn September 29, 2015, Sloan filed with the FEC to run for the Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016. As a candidate for US President, Sloan attempted to run paid television ads on KCCI, the major TV station in Des Moines Iowa, and WMUR TV, the major TV station in Manchester, New Hampshire. Both of these TV stations are owned by Hearst Television. Sloan ran as an anti-war candidate opposing the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Both TV stations refused to run the Sloan paid TV ads on the ground that Sloan had failed to meet his burden to substantiate bona fide candidacy for the Office of the President of the United States under the threshold established by the Communications Act of 1934 and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. Sloan then sued in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, in Concord, New Hampshire. Sloan also named as a defendant Debbie Wasserman Schultz for allowing only two Democratic Party (United States) Candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders into the Democratic Party TV Debates thus making it virtually impossible for any other Democratic Party candidate to run. Sloan alleged that Communications Act of 1934 and Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations 47 USC 315 requires federally licensed broadcasters to provide all candidates running for public office equal opportunity to utilize the broadcast station. Judge Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge disagreed and found and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed that there is no private right of action under this statute and therefore Sloan's case was dismissed. He was only on the New Hampshire ballot and received 15 votes. He lost to Hillary Clinton on July 26, 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Sloan ran in the Democratic primary for US Congress in the New York's 13th congressional district (upper Manhattan/lower Bronx area). The primary was held June 28, 2016 and he received 197 votes (0.46%), placing 8th in a field of 9 candidates and losing to Adriano Espaillat. Despite opening a campaign account for another run for governor in 2018 (which received no donations), Sloan did not submit any petitions for the 2018 gubernatorial election on any party line.\n\nSloan has been married three times. Sloan's second wife, Honzagool, was a native of Chitral (Pakistan) and they had a daughter named Shamema. Sloan and Honzagool soon separated and Sloan left New York for Virginia with Shamema, leaving Shamema in the care of a Virginia couple, while Honzagool returned to Chitral. Sloan was subsequently locked into a child custody struggle, which lasted several years, with that Virginia couple over that same daughter. On September 5, 1991, during an attempt to regain custody of his daughter Shamema, Sloan was arrested. Sloan was convicted of attempted abduction of Shamema and spent 18 months in state prison.\n\nAs of 2016, Sloan's FIDE chess rankings were 1896 and 1923 for blitz.\n\n\n"}

She came to India in 1956, as a missionary and member of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, became actively engaged in interreligious dialogue in India. In time, she became a leading figure in the inculturation (imbibing local cultures) movement that was started in India by Roman Catholic priest Fr Richard De Smet, SJ in the early 1970s, with whom she was closely associated with. Her association with Swami Abhishiktananda, further led to working on the Advaita Vedanta (Nondualism) teachings of Hindu philosopher Adi Sankara, as revealed in her spiritual autobiography, \"Towards an Alternative Theology: Confessions of a Non-dualist Christian\" (1991).\n\nShe taught philosophy in Mumbai and Pune for several years, and remained spent many years as co-acharya of the Christa Prema Seva Ashram in Pune, which combines the Hindu ashram and sannyasa model and Christian monasticism.\n\nSara Grant was born to Scottish parents in Shrewsbury, England, in 1922, and received her early education at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Brighton.\n\nHaving converted to Roman Catholicism after finishing school at the age of 19, she joined the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Jesus order and became a novitiate. She moved to countryside during the war, and later to Oxford University, where she studied classics and philosophy and where one of her mentors was noted British author and philosopher, Iris Murdoch, herself then in the throes of a religious conversion.\n\nSr Sara Grant came as a missionary to India in 1956, to head the newly formed Department of Philosophy at Sophia College (University of Mumbai), Mumbai run by Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, here she taught for many years. Under the influence and guidance of Fr Richard De Smet, SJ, she studied Sanskrit and did a doctorate in the University of Bombay on the concept of relation in Adi Sankaracarya, (ca. 700 C.E.), the authoritative Hindu exponent of the doctrine of non-duality (Advaita). Here she also became close friends with Swami Abhishiktananda, a French Benedictine monk, whose biography she later published in 1998, as \"Swami Abhishiktananda: The man and his message\". In the coming years, she drew upon philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, to embarked upon a path of reconciling Indian and Christian philosophy. Her work with Sankara, and focus on the understanding of Advaita Vedanta, culminated in the drawing parallels with Christian doctrines.\n\nShe became a member of the ecumenical religious community (Anglican and Catholic) of the innovative Christa Prema Seva Ashram (CPS), Shivajinagar, Pune - India. During these years, she also taught Indian philosophy at Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth, Pune, the Catholic Pontifical Institute of Philosophy and Theology.\n\nShe was invited on occasion to lecture on Sankaracarya at Sivananda Ashram, Rishikesh, where she reports that her interpretation of Sankara was well received.\n\nSara Grant was one of the most active Catholics in the area of interreligious dialogue in the second half of the twentieth century.

He famously noted of his work, that: \"There is nothing simple in the world of the arts\" (New York Times, 1995).\n\nSchuyler Garrison Chapin was born on February 13, 1923. He was the son of Lindley Hoffman Paul Chapin (1888–1938) and Leila Howard (née Burden) (1899–1967).\n\nChapin was a ninth generation descendant of Captain Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628–1683), who settled in New Netherland around 1650, with his brother David Pietersen Schuyler. Chapin's maternal pedigree extends to include: Priv. Isaac Kingsland (1710–1803); Third Battalion, of the New Jersey Continental Line, who married 3 Jun. 1741 Joanna (née Schuyler); Chapin's sixth great grandparents removed. Their granddaughter Catherine Schuyler (née Kingsland) married Capt. Oliver Garrison; Chapin's fourth great grandparents removed; parents of Commodore Cornelius Kingsland Garrison; whose granddaughter Cornelia Garrison (née Van Auken) married Lindley Hoffman Chapin; paternal grandparents of Schuyler G. Chapin.\n\nThrough the Schuyler and Van Rensselaer families of New York and New Jersey, Schuyler G. Chapin was the third cousin sixth removed of Elizabeth \"Betsy\" (Schuyler); wife of First U. S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton; daughter of Maj. Gen. Philip John Schuyler, Jr., who was one of four major generals named by Congress in 1775, and third cousin fifth removed of Chapin. Major General Schuyler served instrumentally in the Burgoyne Campaign (1777). \n\nHis paternal side descends in the ninth generation from early English Puritan Deacon Samuel Chapin who arrived in America, from Devonshire, between 1633–1635, and was later one of the founders of Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nWhile still a teenager, in the 1930s, he began accompanying millionaire widow and former actress Eleanor Belmont to the Metropolitan Opera. He attended the Millbrook School in 1940, where he was very active in the performing and musical arts, however, he did not graduate from high school, nor college, but was the recipient of numerous university honors. He became a pilot during World War II.\n\nBy 1953, he had become Jascha Heifetz's tour manager. Around this time, he also befriended Leonard Bernstein, several of whose live recordings, including the Grammy award-winning \"Beethoven's Birthday\" (1970), Chapin produced.\n\nIn 1963, he was named vice-president of Lincoln Center and co-founded the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1969. In 1972, he accepted the position of General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera after the previous GM, Göran Gentele, died in a car accident before the opening of his first season. Chapin stayed on at the Met for four years, subsequently becoming Dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of the Arts. During Chapin’s tenure at Columbia, enrollment doubled, and he raised $7 million and strengthened the fine-arts curriculum. He remained there for 10 years, being kept on as Dean emeritus. He then moved on to the job of vice president of Steinway & Sons before becoming the cultural affairs commissioner of New York City from 1994 to 2001.\n\nIn 2002, he was awarded France's Légion d'honneur, 82 years after his father; L. H. Paul Chapin, a World War I liaison officer between General Pershing and Marshall Foch, received the same honor. He also wrote several books, including \"Leonard Bernstein: Notes From a Friend\" and was also a Board Member Emeritus In Memoriam at The Center for Arts Education.\n\nOn March 15, 1947, he married his first wife, Elizabeth Steinway (1925-1993). Steinway was the daughter of Theodore E. Steinway and Ruth (née Davis) Steinway. The Steinways were descendants of Henry E. Steinway (the founder of Steinway & Sons). Chapin's best man was his uncle by marriage, Francis Biddle, the former United States Attorney General. Together, they had four sons:\nAfter his wife died in 1993, Chapin met and married his second wife, divorcee Catia Zoullas Mortimer, in 1995. Mayor Rudy Giuliani officiated the marriage at Gracie Mansion, New York City.\n\n"}

This convent temple was in front of the \"Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de la Peña de Francia\".\n\nThe nun was given various gifts such as the reading of souls. According to popular tradition, Sor Maria was able to read the mind of a convent servant, named \"Felipa\", who prayed that God would lead her to purgatory after her death. The nun rebuked her, urging her to ask God to go to heaven instead of purgatory. Another miracle attributed to the nun happened when a mason who worked in the convent fell into the void, rushing to the ground gently and swaying, without dying or suffering damage, since the workman had entrusted to the nun.\n\nMaría de San Antonino died on May 10, 1741. According to the files, her body remained incorrupt and kept her blood fresh. The acts of exhumation and translation of her remains were verified when Monsignor Antonio Luis Folgueras y Sión was bishop of the Diocese of Tenerife. Her body is not currently preserved, as it disappeared in the convent fire in 1925.\n\n"}
{"id": "13863966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13863966", "title": "T. B. Joshua", "text": "T. B. Joshua\n\nTemitope Balogun Joshua (born June 12, 1963), commonly referred to as T. B. Joshua, is a Nigerian pastor, televangelist and philanthropist. He is the leader and founder of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN), a Christian organisation that runs the Emmanuel TV television station from Lagos.\n\nJoshua is known for his popularity across Africa and his online presence with 2,000,000 fans on Facebook and over 400,000 YouTube subscribers. Described as the \"Oprah of evangelism\" and \"YouTube's most popular Pastor\", Emmanuel TV is Africa's largest Christian television network \n\nHe has been awarded various accolades, notably receiving the Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) by the Nigerian government in 2008 and being voted the Yoruba man of the decade by Pan-Yoruba media outlet Irohin-Odua. He has been called one of Africa's 50 most influential people by Pan-African magazines \"The Africa Report\" and \"New African Magazine\"\n\n, according to \"Forbes\", Joshua was Nigeria's third-richest pastor, although the claim was immediately denied in a statement by the church. He is known to be controversial, and was even 'blacklisted' by the government of Cameroon in 2010. \n\nAccording to Joshua's official biography, unusual circumstances surrounded his birth. He says that he spent 15 months in his mother's womb and narrowly avoided death after a quarry explosion near his house sent rocks through its roof just seven days after his birth. It is also alleged that Joshua's birth was 'prophesied' 100 years prior.\nJoshua, then known as Balogun Francis, attended St. Stephen's Anglican Primary School in Arigidi Akoko, Nigeria between 1971 and 1977, but failed to complete one year of secondary school education. In school, he was known as \"small pastor\" because of his love for the Bible. He worked in various casual jobs after his schooling had ended, including carrying chicken waste at a poultry farm. He organised Bible studies for local children and attended evening school during this period. Joshua attempted to join the Nigerian military but was thwarted due to a train breakdown that left him stranded en route to the military academy.\n\nJoshua wrote that in a heavenly vision he had received divine anointing and a covenant from God to start his ministry. Following this, Joshua founded the ministry organisation The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN). According to the organisation, more than 15,000 members attend its weekly Sunday service; visitors from outside Nigeria are accommodated in the accommodation blocks constructed at the church.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported that The SCOAN attracts more weekly attendees than the combined number of visitors to Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. The SCOAN's popular services have also resulted in an enormous boost for local businesses and hoteliers.\n\nDespite Joshua's popularity, the church only has a branch in Ghana, Joshua stating that \"it is not yet time\" for him to have branches worldwide as \"it will be too much for my character\".\n\nThe SCOAN has been described as “Nigeria’s biggest tourist attraction” and “the most visited destination by religious tourists in West Africa,” with thousands of foreigners flocking to attend the church's weekly services. Figures released by the Nigerian Immigration Service indicated that six out of every ten foreign travellers coming into Nigeria are bound for The SCOAN, a fact discussed in Zimbabwean parliament when addressing the economic potentials of religious tourism.\n\nThis Day newspapers reported that “about two million local and inbound tourists” visit The SCOAN annually. The church's popularity has led to an increase in flight routes to Lagos from several African countries in 2013.\n\nJoshua's contribution to Nigeria's religious tourism was highlighted when the cleric hinted at the possibility of relocating his ministry to Israel during a Sunday service. The announcement proved controversial with several prominent Nigerians urging him to remain in the country, citing the economic setbacks Nigeria would likely experience through his potential relocation.\n\nSCOAN claims regular occurrences of divine miracles. Several hundred Nigerians and international visitors come to the SCOAN each week to register for the prayer lines where the visitors are prayed over by Joshua. SCOAN has published numerous videos claiming to document the healing of incurable disabilities and illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, blindness and open wounds.\n\nSpiritual healing at The SCOAN has been the subject of several media reports, including a mention in \"Time Magazine\", an Associated Press interview and an article by Foreign Policy detailing the tendency of Nigerians to seek 'spiritual' help due to insufficient medical facilities.\n\nA huge debate was stirred within Nigeria when the father of abducted school girl Ese Oruru stated his intention to take his daughter to T.B. Joshua for 'prayers' following her release. Similarly, a leaked report stating the intention of Nigeria's embattled former petroleum minister Diezani Alison-Madueke to visit Joshua for 'spiritual support' in her battle against breast cancer elicited controversy.\n\nMany have also claimed to be healed through 'Anointing Water' that has been prayed over by Joshua and given to those who are unable to physically attend his church in Lagos. Others claim they were protected from deadly incidents because they had the water with them.\n\nIn 2013, four people died in a stampede in Joshua's Ghanaian branch when an unadvertised service where it was being distributed drew huge crowds far beyond the churches capacity, bringing Ghana's capital city Accra almost to a standstill.\n\nJoshua also made headlines when he claimed his Anointing Water could cure the deadly disease Ebola. He subsequently sent 4,000 bottles of the water alongside a cash gift of $50,000 to the Ebola-stricken nation of Sierra Leone. This came after Lagos State Health officials visited Joshua, requesting him to publicly discourage Ebola victims from visiting his church for prayers. A Sierra Leonean politician later claimed the water helped stop the spread of the disease and cured several Ebola victims.\n\nSCOAN is also known for the purported \"deliverance\" of those allegedly possessed by evil spirits during its services.\n\nStrange occurrences have been reported during these deliverance prayers, including the case of a South African girl who allegedly 'cried blood' and a Liberian man who began behaving 'like a dog'. A young man allegedly delivered from a 'homosexual demon' at The SCOAN also attracted widespread media attention, as did the 'transformation' of a Paraguayan transvestite.\n\nAfter 'deliverance', those involved often confess the atrocities which the 'evil spirit' allegedly pushed them to engage in, such as prostitution, armed robbery, internet fraud and human trafficking.\n\nThe wife of Ghanaian goal keeper Richard Kingson was delivered of an evil spirit which was supposedly behind her husband's inability to procure a contract. Notable Ghanaian human rights lawyer Kwabla Senanu claimed that he was delivered from a spiritual problem. Similarly, Ghanaian musician Denise Williams said she was delivered from a demon that had pushed her to become a drug addict and suicidal.\n\nVeteran Nigerian Nollywood Actress Camilla Mberekpe was also said to have been delivered at The SCOAN. Popular Nollywood actor Jim Iyke also said he received deliverance at The SCOAN, the video of the event subsequently going viral.\n\nA video of Kenyan Olympic athlete Mercy Cherono receiving 'deliverance' through Joshua's prayers attracted widespread attention in Kenya. She subsequently testified in the company of her husband how the 'evil spirit' had negatively affected her young marriage and career.\n\nAlthough Joshua rarely goes abroad, he has travelled to Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Paraguay to hold 'crusades'. He also visited Israel to receive a humanitarian award from ZAKA and visit Biblical sites.\n\nHis 'Miracle Crusade' in Cali, Colombia in July 2014 was allegedly attended by 100,000 people and held in the Estadio Olímpico Pascual Guerrero. He additionally held a meeting with Cali's police force, giving a donation of $100,000 to support the families killed or injured in the course of their duties.\n\nHe travelled to the iconic Estadio Azteca in Mexico which was allegedly attended by 200,000 people over two days in May 2015.\n\nContinuing his travels across Latin America, Joshua's two-day visit to Estadio Monumental \"U\" in Lima, Peru, attracted nearly 100,000 in September 2016, making headlines in local Peruvian media.\n\nIn August 2017, Joshua held a Crusade in Paraguay at Estadio Defensores del Chaco. His visit caused a media storm when the Paraguayan parliament approved that the cleric be awarded with the ‘National Order of Merit’, the countries highest honour usually reserved only for its own citizens. Testimonies from those who alleged they were healed through Joshua's prayers at the crusade made headlines in local media.\n\nThe SCOAN is involved in extensive humanitarian projects worldwide, a \"Forbes\" blogger estimating that Joshua has spent $20 million on charitable activities. Several media reports show the church has donated large amounts of money in order to help orphans, widows, elderly, physically challenged and destitute There is also a rehabilitation programme for militants from Nigeria's volatile Niger Delta region, repentant armed robbers and sex workers who came to the church for 'deliverance'. Joshua allegedly joins his team in several of the humanitarian journeys they undertake to less-privileged communities \n\nJoshua's followers celebrate his birthday on June 12 by assisting less-privileged individuals in their societies.\n\nJoshua has come to the aid of several communities in distress, notably providing two transformers to a local community after theirs was burned beyond repair. He donated over N26m towards restoring electricity and putting an end to over two years of power outage in four councils in Akoko area of Ondo State. The cleric has additionally made several large donations to the police force in Nigeria, Ghana and Colombia.\n\nThe SCOAN has a 'scholarship program' which caters for the academic needs of students in their thousands, ranging from primary to tertiary education. In 2012, Joshua sponsored a Nigerian student doing a PhD in Oxford University, with Nigerian media reporting she received £100,000 from the church. He also gave a scholarship to a young Motswana to study at Harvard Law School in America.\n\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Joshua sent a team of medical personnel and humanitarian workers to the affected area, establishing a field hospital called 'Clinique Emmanuel'.\n\nHe additionally sent support to nations such as Philippines, India and Ghana in the wake of varying natural disasters. The 'Emmanuel TV Team' also assisted victims of the earthquake that struck the nation of Ecuador in April 2016, providing over $500,000 worth of humanitarian aid.\n\nJoshua funded the building and running of a school in Lahore, Pakistan named 'Emmanuel School'. He also rebuilt a school in a rural area destroyed by the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, travelling to Ecuador for the opening of the school in June 2017.\n\nSeveral groups of Nigerians attempting illegal travel to Europe through Libya have been supported at The SCOAN following their deportation from the North African nation with only the clothes on their backs. Stories of the harsh conditions they encountered and Joshua's subsequent assistance made headlines in several local newspapers.\n\nIn 2009, Joshua started a football club, My People FC, as part of efforts to help the youth. Two members of the team played for Nigeria's Golden Eaglets in the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Sani Emmanuel, who apparently lived in The SCOAN for several years, was Nigeria's top-scorer and the tournament's MVP. Emmanuel and his colleague Ogenyi Onazi signed professional contracts with SS Lazio, Onazi a key player for the Nigerian Senior Team, the Super Eagles.\n\nWBO International Light Middleweight boxing champion King Davidson Emenogu said that Joshua has financially supported him throughout his career and purportedly prophesied that he would be a world boxing champion.\n\nJoshua was involved in the meeting of the family of the late president of Liberia, Samuel Doe, with the former warlord Prince Yormie Johnson who was responsible for Doe's death. During this meeting the family publicly forgave Johnson who said it was through Joshua's prayers that he stopped drinking alcohol and turned to Christianity.\n\nThe cleric has also plays a prominent role in reconciling broken homes and restoring families torn apart by false accusations.\n\nIn recognition of his humanitarian activities, he was awarded a National Honour by the Nigerian government in 2008 as well as receiving a letter of appreciation from the United Nations. He was further honoured as an Ambassador of Peace by the Arewa Youth Forum, a predominantly Muslim organisation, as well as being recognised with an 'award of excellence' by ZAKA, Israel's primary rescue and recovery voluntary service.\n\nSCOAN claims that Joshua has successfully predicted events in the lives of individuals who attend his church services as well as worldwide events, including a purported prophecy of Michael Jackson's death, and the outcome of two African Cup of Nations (AFCON) final matches, which were won by Zambia and Nigeria respectively. He has been voted by the public among the most famous prophets.\n\nHis prophecy about the impending death of an African president was widely reported in African press. Joshua's followers believe the prophecy concerned the former president of Malawi Bingu wa Mutharika who died in 2012, aged 78.\n\nFalse rumors spread using Joshua's name are known to have caused widespread panic in communities, affected sporting events, music concerts and led people to stop using social networks.\n\nWhen Hamza Al-Mustapha, the Chief Security Officer of former Nigerian President Sani Abacha, was released after eleven years of imprisonment, his first port of call was to Joshua's church in acknowledgement of a 'prophecy' the cleric allegedly gave him when Abacha was still in power.\n\nCritics argue that Joshua's predictions are too vague.\n\nSCOAN released a video claiming that TB Joshua predicted the Malaysian Airlines MH370 event. The prophecy received a lot of attention on social media and its accompanying YouTube video amassed over 1 million views.\n\nSeveral terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS, Al-Qaeda affiliates and Al-Shabaab militants have allegedly been predicted by Joshua, including the November 2015 Paris attacks, the Garissa University College attack in Kenya, the Ouagadougou hotel siege in Burkina Faso and the 2016 Brussels Bombings. It is also claimed that he predicted the Boston bombing attacks in America.\n\nJoshua's alleged prophecy in April 2016 that an impending terror attack would befall Ghana made national headlines in the West African nation and led the national police to issue a statement calling for the general public to be calm and vigilant. 600 foreigners reportedly cancelled their visits to Ghana in the wake of the statement. Days later, a captured Malian terrorist confessed that his group had planned to target Ghana.\n\nJoshua incorrectly predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 US election. After this prophecy failed to materialise, with Donald Trump winning the election, Joshua stated that he was referring to Clinton's win in the popular vote and any misinterpretation was due to a lack of \"spiritual understanding\".\n\nA video of Joshua predicting \"the military\" of an undisclosed Southern African nation embarrassing, killing or capturing \"a President or Vice-President ... or the First Lady of that nation‚” surfaced on social media after the statement, which was made and recorded in August 2014, was interpreted as a prophecy of the 2017 coup against Zimbabwe's long-term leader Robert Mugabe.\n\nNotable visitors to SCOAN have included late Ghanaian President John Evans Atta Mills South Africa's Winnie Mandela, EFF leader Julius Malema, the Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, former Malawian President Joyce Banda, Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangarai and the late Zambian President Frederick Chiluba who once stated that he watched 'Emmanuel TV' daily.\n\nTanzanian President John Magufuli visited The SCOAN in 2011. Days to his inauguration in November 2015, Joshua visited Tanzania where he met Magufuli (who received him at the airport), the outgoing President Jakaya Kikwete and opposition leader Edward Lowassa. His visit caused a media storm in Tanzania, even though he did not publicly appear at the inauguration.\n\nNigeria's former President Goodluck Jonathan visited The SCOAN in September 2014 following the tragic building collapse of a guesthouse within the church premises. After Jonathan conceded defeat to Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria's historic 2015 elections, Joshua controversially claimed he had warned him of his impending electoral defeat, an assertion later corroborated by one of Jonathan's aides.\n\nA BBC Africa journalist once questioned whether Joshua was “the most powerful man in Africa” due to his alleged influence in the African political sphere.\n\nDays after the late John Atta Mills became President of Ghana in 2009, his first port of call was Joshua's church for a thanksgiving service where he revealed the cleric had accurately ‘prophesied’ his ascension to power and specific details relating to his narrow victory over Nana Akufo-Addo. Joshua was a regular visitor to Ghana during Mill's early presidency and allegedly organised prayer warriors to be praying in Osu Castle.\n\nJoshua's much-publicised prophecy concerning the death of Malawian President Bingu Mutharika garnered intense media attention and was subsequently the subject of a Malawian government inquiry as his successor, Joyce Banda, is a devotee of the cleric. Banda claimed Joshua's prayers healed her husband after he suffered a stroke and regularly visited Joshua in Nigeria while she was Head of State.\n\nJoshua played the role of a peacemaker in the aftermath of the Tanzanian elections in 2015, visiting the country to meet and hold reconciliatory talks with President John Magufuli – a member of his church – and opposition leader Edward Lowassa. Commentators acknowledged his visit significantly reduced tensions in the country after the elections which the opposition party alleged were fraught with irregularities.\n\nJoshua was a key influence in former Liberian warlord Senator Prince Yormie Johnson’s decision to endorse the candidacy of George Weah for president in the 2017 Liberian elections. His endorsement came days after the two were spotted publicly together in The SCOAN, a visit that caused a media storm in Liberia. Weah's main opponent and current Vice President, Joseph Boakai, also allegedly requested to visit Joshua in lieu of the elections.\n\nEmmanuel TV, the SCOAN television station, broadcasts 24/7. Its Sunday services are broadcast live. Joshua's programmes also air weekly on a number of local television stations across Africa. It debuted on DStv and GOtv in November 2015, as well as StarTimes in February 2016. In its profile on Joshua, the BBC described him as \"Nigeria's best known televangelist\".\n\nA Ghanaian psychiatrist in UK was controversially sacked from the NHS after recommending Emmanuel TV to a patient with a history of 'satanic abuse', although later cleared of any wrongdoing by a tribunal.\n\nEmmanuel TV's motto is 'Changing lives, changing nations, changing the world.' The station is also known for its catch-phrase, ‘Distance Is Not A Barrier’, encouraging viewers to ‘pray along’ with T.B. Joshua by ‘touching the screen’. There are several claims of people receiving miraculous 'healing' through these prayers, including popular Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh who said Joshua's prayers ended her 14-year smoking addiction.\n\nJoshua has earned a reputation for not focusing on the 'Prosperity Gospel' and Emmanuel TV is known as one of the few Christian channels that does not engage in fundraising on air.\n\nEmmanuel TV's YouTube Channel is one of the most subscribed Christian YouTube channels worldwide and the most subscribed in Nigeria, having amassed over 700,000 subscribers and 300 million views since its inception. Google ranked one of Emmanuel TV's YouTube videos as the fourth most viewed clip ever within Nigeria.\n\nJoshua has many critics and is known to be controversial.\n\nJoshua has been publicly condemned by several prominent pastors within Nigeria, his most vocal critic being Pastor Kris Okotie who described him as a 'son of the devil'. The Christian Association of Nigeria and Pentecostal Fellowship Of Nigeria have both acknowledged Joshua is not a member of either organisation and denounced him as an 'impostor'.Enoch Adeboye, David Oyedepo, Ayo Oritsejafor, Paul Adefarasin and Matthew Ashimolowo are among the pastors who publicly denounced Joshua, as did disgraced American megachurch leader Ted Haggard.\n\nHe was 'blacklisted' by the government of Cameroon in 2010 and termed a 'son of the devil'. Rumours of a visit by Joshua to Zimbabwe in 2012 led to an intense national debate, culminating with pastors and politicians strongly objecting.\n\nA popular Ghanaian 'witch-doctor' said he went to the Vatican City to 'report' Joshua to Pope Francis for his 'false' prophecies.\n\nIn 2011, several media houses in UK reported at least three people in London with HIV died after they stopped taking life saving drugs on the advice of their pastors. The HIV prevention charity African Health Policy Network (AHPN) believed that The SCOAN \"may\" be one of those involved in such practices although the three in question have no demonstrable link to the SCOAN. The BBC quoted The SCOAN as saying \"No, we do not ask people to stop taking their medication\".\n\nOn 14 September 2015 it was reported that Joshua \"secretly purchased a $60 Million Gulfstream G550 Private Jet\". These rumors were dismissed as false by a media aide of Joshua.\n\nA self-confessed member of the Islamic sect Boko Haram came to The SCOAN in March 2014, allegedly with plans to 'bomb' the church. According to him, it was Joshua's prayers that prevented the plan and later compelled him to confess. The subsequent clip of the confession went viral on YouTube and proved very controversial. A group known as the \"Movement for Accountability and Good Governance\", has called for the investigation of the incident based on the claims that were made.\n\nOn 12 September 2014, a guesthouse collapsed in the SCOAN's premises in Lagos killing at least 115 people, 84 of them South Africans. Controversy has continued to swirl around the circumstances that led to the collapse, with the former Nigerian Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode alleging Nigeria's intelligence agencies ‘blew up’ the building.\n\nIn March 2016, the President of Malawi, Peter Mutharika, attacked Joshua as a 'false prophet' for allegedly predicting his impending death. His comments were condemned by the Evangelical Association of Malawi (EAM), especially as there was no record of the purported prediction.\n\nNigeria's Premium Times newspaper stated that Joshua incorporated a company called Chillon Consultancy Limited in the British Virgin Islands in June 2006, based on reports stemming from the Panama Papers leak. Joshua immediately denied his involvement, stating on Facebook, \"I am not a businessman and have no business whatsoever. What God has given me is more than enough.\" \n\nA prominent Nigerian Muslim cleric, Sheikh Hussaini Yusuf Mabera, threatened to drag Joshua to court for \"describing Jesus Christ as God\".\n\nJoshua is married to Evelyn Joshua. They have three children. His eldest daughter Serah Joshua is a graduate from the London School of Economics, Department of Law. and was 'called to the bar' in Nigeria in December 2015. His second daughter, Promise Joshua, is studying Politics and International Relations at the London School of Economics.\n\n\n"}

She is currently serving as the Chairperson of the Ulu Pandan Youth Executive Committee for the Young PAP (YPAP), the PAP's youth wing, and a member of the Community Development Welfare Fund Committee.\n\nTin is married to Ng How Yue, Second Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and formerly a Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Tin Pei Ling has a baby that was born on 5 August 2015, and was named Ng Kee Hau.\n\nTin attended Crescent Girls' School and Hwa Chong Junior College during her adolescent years. She attended the National University of Singapore to major in psychology.\n\nPrior to the formation of the 17th Young PAP Executive Committee marked by the 2011 elections, Tin was formerly assistant treasurer for Young PAP and a representative for the Ulu Pandan branch.\n\nIn the 2011 general election, Tin was selected as a candidate for the Marine Parade GRC alongside former prime minister Goh Chok Tong among others. Having been a member of the Ulu Pandan branch of the Young PAP for 7 years, she was fielded by the PAP as a candidate to attract the \"unpredictable\" youth vote through social networking sites. On election day, the PAP took Marine Parade GRC with 56.65% of the votes, defeating National Solidarity Party's team led by Cheo Chai Chen Goh Chok Tong admitted after the election that Tin's youth and negative image perceived by the public was a \"factor\" for the People's Action Party's weaker performance this election compared to their 72.9% win in 1992. On 1 June 2011, Tin announced on her Facebook account that she had resigned from her Senior Associate position in Ernst & Young, where she had worked for four years. She said the decision was made in order to focus on her responsibilities as full-time MP in her MacPherson ward and the Marine Parade GRC.\n\nTin's selection as a candidate for Parliament in 2011 resulted in a large online backlash, especially amongst young Singaporeans. Throughout the campaign, Tin garnered negative attention due to her perceived immaturity to become an MP, and allusions were also raised as to how her husband's position had opened doors for her into politics. A widely circulated Facebook photo of Tin posing with a Kate Spade-branded gift from her husband, also led to widespread accusations online of ignorance, materialism and privilege. When asked if there was a policy she would change, she replied that there were no policy that she felt strongly against. When asked what her \"greatest regret\" was, she said it was not having brought her (still living) parents to Universal Studios Singapore.\n\nSome Singaporeans were concerned that as an \"undeserving [candidate],\" Tin had a high chance of being elected \"not on [her] own merit, but rather on the back of established MPs\" since the 5-member PAP team would be voted in or rejected as a group under Singapore's Group Representative Constituency system.\n\nThe public's online hostility towards Tin was so great that Goh Chok Tong defended her in the press. He said he had taken Tin in when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had offered her to be fielded as a candidate in his GRC. He had accepted her as he did not think Tin was a weak candidate. He dismissed the online criticisms as \"distortion\" and even though \"some sound bites of her which pitted her as a rather light-weight person\", it was just \"a superficial view\". He still believed that she \"would work very hard\", \"[could] reach out to the young, and the not so young,\" that he \"would like her to do more to help the old people in MacPherson,\" and that she would become \"a good MP in due course\".\n\nNicole Seah from the National Solidarity Party (NSP) team in Marine Parade GRC filed a complaint to the Elections Department on 6 May 2011, stating that Tin had violated the state-mandated cooling-off period 24 hours before polls by posting a Facebook comment on Seah crying during her walkabout. Under the Singapore Parliamentary Elections Act, canvassing on Polling Day and Cooling Off Day is prohibited and the offence carries a fine or imprisonment or both. When questioned, Tin replied that one of her administrators, Denise He, had posted the comment under her account and that He had meant to post in her own capacity from her phone, but had forgotten to log out of Tin's account. The NSP team was advised by the Elections Department to file a police report before the Elections Department could investigate. The police confirmed that a report was lodged against her. The police issued a stern warning to Tin as well as Seah, who also had a similar complaint lodged against her.\n\nIn the 2015 Singaporean general election, MacPherson SMC was split from Marine Parade GRC for the first time since the 2006 elections. She ran against Bernard Chen of the Workers' Party and Cheo Chai Chen of the National Solidarity Party. Cheo's campaign suffered a major blunder when he described Tin's new role as a mother as \"her weakness\" in the campaign. Facing public backlash, Cheo later claimed that this comment was meant as a joke. She received 17,227 votes, or 65.58% of the total, compared to Chen's 33.6% and Cheo's 0.82%.\n\n"}

He is considered to be the most eminent weapons designer of the pre-war Czechoslovakia. He had applied for more than 75 patents during his active years.\n\nVáclav Holek was born in a village of Malé Nepodřice, southern Bohemia, in 1886. He completed his apprenticeship as a gunsmith and studied afterwards in the town of Písek. In 1905 he started working with an Anton Mulacz company in Vienna, from 1910 he had acquired a job with the gunsmith Jan Nowotný in Prague, where he took part in refining of Holland & Holland system shotguns. During World War I the company produced artillery guns for the Austro-Hungarian Army.\n\nIn 1918 Holek switched to the Zbrojovka Praga, a firearm company newly established by the son of Holek’s former boss Jan Nowotný. Here a service semi-automatic pistol designated for the Czechoslovak Army and police designed by Holek came into existence. And it was here where, in the spring time of 1921, Václav Holek constructed a light machine gun from which the Czechoslovak Army light machine gun PRAGA vz. 24 was born, the predecessor of the ZB vz. 26 light machine gun. (Later, British Royal Small Arms Factory of Enfield bought the license and produced some 220,000 of those guns marked as Bren.)\n\nIn December 1924 Holek switched to the Československá zbrojovka in Brno, where, in the 1930s, he developed the ZB-53 machine gun, of which 60.000 pieces marked as Besa machine gun were produced in Britain.\n\nDuring World War II and in the post-war years Václav Holek developed a number of modern semi-automatic weapons out of which only the Vz. 52 light machine gun saw the production line.\n\n"}

Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data collection policies during the Barack Obama administration. In 2016, Binney said the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election was false, but on close examination of the documents that purported to prove a British origin of the hacking, could not prove the data was downloaded from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nBinney grew up in rural Pennsylvania and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the Pennsylvania State University in 1970. He said that he volunteered for the Army during the Vietnam era in order to select work that would interest him rather than be drafted and have no input. He was found to have strong aptitudes for mathematics, analysis, and code breaking, and served from 1965 to 1969 in the Army Security Agency before going to the NSA in 1970.\n\nBinney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).\n\nAfter retiring from the NSA, he founded, together with fellow NSA whistleblower J. Kirk Wiebe, Entity Mapping, LLC, a private intelligence agency to market their analysis program to government agencies.\n\nKirk Wiebe and William Binney \"have started a company (Pretty Good Knowledge) with partners in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, to resurrect and do the kinds of smart things we thought we do with data back in the 1990s, because this government and the Deep State as well as the shadow government didn't want us doing that here. So we're over there doing this.\"\n\nIn September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting \"millions and millions of dollars\" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that \"it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had\" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread. He was furious that the NSA hadn't uncovered the 9/11 plot and stated that intercepts it had collected but not analyzed likely would have garnered timely attention with his leaner more focused system.\n\nAfter he left the NSA in 2001, Binney was one of several people investigated as part of an inquiry into a 2005 \"The New York Times\" exposé on the agency’s warrantless eavesdropping program. Binney was cleared of wrongdoing after three interviews with FBI agents beginning in March 2007, but in early July 2007, in an unannounced, armed, early morning raid, a dozen agents armed with rifles appeared at his house, one of whom entered the bathroom and pointed his gun at Binney, who was taking a shower. The FBI confiscated a desktop computer, disks, and personal and business records. The NSA revoked his security clearance, forcing him to close a business he ran with former colleagues at a loss of a reported $300,000 in annual income. The FBI raided the homes of Wiebe and Loomis, as well as House Intelligence Committee staffer Diane Roark, the same morning. Several months later the FBI raided the home of then still active NSA executive Thomas Andrews Drake who had also contacted DoD IG, but anonymously with confidentiality assured. The Assistant Inspector General, John Crane, in charge of the Whistleblower Program, suspecting his superiors provided confidential information to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), challenged them, was eventually forced from his position, and subsequently himself became a public whistleblower. The punitive treatment of Binney, Drake, and the other whistleblowers also led Edward Snowden to go public with his revelations rather than report through the internal whistleblower program. In 2012, Binney and his co-plaintiffs went to federal court to retrieve the confiscated items.\n\nBinney is known for making the claim that the NSA collects and stores information about every U.S. communication. Binney was invited as a witness by the NSA commission of the German Bundestag. On July 3, 2014 \"Der Spiegel\" wrote, he said that the NSA wanted to have information about everything. In Binney's view this is a totalitarian approach, which had previously been seen only in dictatorships. Binney stated that the goal was to control people. Meanwhile, he said that it is possible in principle to monitor the whole population, abroad and in the U.S., which in his view contradicts the United States Constitution.\n\nIn August 2014 Binney was among the signatories of an open letter by the group Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity to German chancellor Angela Merkel in which they urged the Chancellor to be suspicious of U.S. intelligence regarding the alleged invasion of Russia in Eastern Ukraine. In the open letter, the group said:\n\n[A]ccusations of a major Russian \"invasion\" of Ukraine appear not to be supported by reliable intelligence. Rather, the \"intelligence\" seems to be of the same dubious, politically \"fixed\" kind used 12 years ago to \"justify\" the U.S.-led attack on Iraq.\n\nBinney claims the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election is false, and that the Democratic National Committee e-mails were leaked by an insider instead. He has appeared on Fox News at least ten times between September 2016 and November 2017 to promote this theory. Binney said that the \"intelligence community wasn’t being honest here\". He has also been frequently cited on Breitbart News. In November 2017 it was reported that a month earlier, Binney had met with CIA Director Mike Pompeo at the behest of President Trump.\n\nOn January 23, 2018, Binney made an appearance on the Infowars news program in connection with the Nunes memo, a Congressional document alleging irregularities in the application of the FISA Act, which at that time was not publicly available although its potential release was a topic of public debate. During the show, host Alex Jones announced that Binney had been able to provide him with the actual memo, and the purported leaked document was shown on air. However, this was in fact a public document that had been available on the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence since at least May 2017. The actual Nunes memo was released February 2, 2018.\n\nBinney's story is recounted in \"A Good American\", a documentary film.\n\n\n"}
