In 1612 he entered in the Order of Saint Basil the Great, in the monastery of the Holy Trinity in Vilnius, taking the religious name of Anton (Antony). He lived for some time in the same cell with Saint Josaphat Kuntsevich and he was ordained a priest in 1617. He studied in the Greek College in Rome from 1617 to September 1619.\n\nOn 12 November 1623 the bishop of Polotsk, Josaphat Kuntsevich (later declared a Saint), was killed by an Orthodox mob. After him, Anton Sielava was appointed to the See of Polotsk. He was consecrated a bishop in early 1624 by Metropolitan Joseph Rutski and enthroned on 14 February 1624.\n\nTo Metropolitan Joseph Rutski succeeded Metropolitan Rafajil Korsak, who, when in 1639 left Belarus to go to Rome for Visit ad Limina, appointed Sielava as Vicarius for the Church. Rafajil Korsak died in Rome in August 1640 and, according to his last will, Pope Urban VIII confirmed Sielava as new Metropolitan after the usual process of eligibility. Anton Sielava was so formally appointed Metropolitan of Kiev on 18 March 1641. His patriarchate was initially marked by the beatification, on 16 May 1643, of Josaphat Kuntsevich.\n\nFollowing his predecessors Joseph Rutski and Rafajil Korsak, Sielava went on in negotiations with the Orthodox Patriarch of Kiev, Peter Mogila about the way to unify the Ukrainian Church. However he was not a person of the stamp of his predecessors, and after the death of Mogila (1646), the discussions ended without results.\n\nSielava left much part of the administration of the Church to others, and he was of a sickly disposition and quite hypochondriac, and in the last part of his life he was seriously ill and blind.\n\nSince 1648, the political situation in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth underwent years of crisis due to the Khmelnytsky Uprising, a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine fiercely anti-Catholic, followed by the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667) and Second Northern War. The Greek-Catholic Church was seriously threaten, many churches, monasteries and schools were destroyed, and priests and monks killed. Sielava had to leave Polotsk and died on 5 October 1655, when already (since 1653) the Greek-Catholic Church was in the resolute hands of Gabriel Kolenda.\n\nAnton Sielava was also a writer and a polemist. Among his works we have his \"\"Antelenchus\", against the \"Elenchum\" of Meletius Smotrytski, and his \"Vitam Servi Dei Josaphat, Archiepiscopi Polocensis\"\" (Life of the Servant of God Josaphat, bishop of Polotsk) edited in 1624.\n\n"}

The Carews were a well-established Devonshire family. Although they had a reputation for adventurousness, Bampfylde Moore Carew took this to extremes, if his picaresque memoirs are to be believed. Little is known about his life beyond these, in which he is described on the title-page as \"the Noted Devonshire Stroller and Dogstealer\".\n\n\"The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew\" was first published in 1745. Although it states that the contents were \"noted by himself during his passage to America\" and it is likely facts were supplied by Carew, the author was probably Robert Goadby, a printer in Sherborne, Dorset, who published an early edition in 1749. It has been suggested that Carew dictated his memoirs to Mrs. Goadby.\n\nThe \"Life and Adventures\" continued to be a best seller throughout the next hundred years in numerous editions as books and chapbooks. He became a nationally known character, appealing to a provincial audience. One edition of his life was printed in Hull in 1785.\n\nHow much of the Life is true is impossible now to know. Carew certainly travelled and is likely to have indulged in minor crimes but many stories seem too fantastic or literary to be true. It appealed to the market for mild 'rogue' literature and many editions included a canting dictionary. The public found \"The Life\" appealing: an educated man from a good family who spent his life ingeniously and audaciously outwitting the establishment, including people who should have recognised him and without ever doing anything really bad.\n\nCarew seemingly settled in Bickleigh towards the end of his life. This may have been because of an offer of support from his relative, Sir Thomas Carew of Bickerton, winning a lottery, or because of age and weariness. Some editions of \"The Life and Adventures\" suggest Carew reflected with sadness on how 'idly' he had spent his life, perhaps making a racy story acceptable by adding a moral ending.\n\nCarew died at Bickleigh in 1759, leaving a daughter.\n\nCarew claims to have taken to the road after he ran away from Blundell's School in Tiverton. With friends, he chased a deer through fields causing damage, which caused farmers to complain to the headmaster. Carew ran away and, at an alehouse, fell in with a band of “gypsies”. (These were almost certainly not Romany but vagabonds living off their wits.) Carew travelled widely, at first around Devon and then around England, supporting himself by playing confidence tricks on the wealthy.\n\nHis first trick involved a “Madam Musgrove”, who asked for his help in discovering treasure she believed was hidden on her land. Carew, consulting “the secrets of his arts” for a fee of 20 guineas, informed her it was under a laurel tree but that she should not seek it until a particular day and hour. Of course by the appointed hour Carew and her money were long gone. This was a well-known and documented trick from a period when cunning folk were often consulted about lost items.\n\nCarew claimed to be a master of disguise, in which he followed the tradition of counterfeit rogues dating back to Thomas Harman. He masqueraded as a shipwrecked sailor (a popular way to claim alms), a clergyman, and defrauding “Squire Portman” twice in one day, first as a rat-catcher and then a woman whose daughter had been killed in a fire, (another staple of fraudulent beggars).\n\nCarew then travelled to Newfoundland, where he stayed a short time. On his return, he pretended to be the mate of a vessel and eloped with the daughter of a respectable apothecary of Newcastle on Tyne, whom he afterwards married. After further years as a vagabond, he claimed to have been elected King of the Gypsies upon the death of Clause Patch. The ceremony described reproduces one from Thomas Harman’s \"Caveat for Common Cursitors\", via the popular play The Beggars' Bush by Francis Beaumont, John Fletcher, and Philip Massinger in which Clause is a character.\n\nCarew was convicted of being an idle vagrant and sentenced to be transported to Maryland. There he attempted to escape, was captured, escaped again, and fell in with friendly Indians. He travelled to Pennsylvania, swam the Delaware, adopted the guise of a Quaker, and made his way to Philadelphia and New York City.\n\nHaving embarked for England, he escaped being pressed to serve in the Navy by pricking his hands and face, and rubbing in bay salt and gunpowder, so as to simulate smallpox. \nSuch tricks were commonplaces in rogue literature. \nOn returning to England, he claims to have found his wife and daughter and then travelled to Scotland by 1745 in time to accompany Charles Edward Stuart to Carlisle and Derby.\n\nAn interesting aside is that when he was sentenced to be transported to Maryland it was in the ships of a company run by a family of Bideford Port, Devon, which later married into the Moore, Bampfylde, and Carew families. \n\nThere is a Bond and a Contract from Mr Davy, Clerk of the Peace and Justices, for the transport of Richard Bond, Bampfield Moore Carew, William Crocker, Abraham Hart, Edward Browne, John Smith, Judith Daw and Mary Underhill to Virginia. Bampfield Moore Carew's name is inserted in the Bond only. The trade of transporting convicts was common from the west country ports in the 18th century as a return cargo for the tobacco trades, Bideford being one of the major centres for such imports.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1204329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1204329", "title": "Coaching inn", "text": "Coaching inn\n\nThe coaching inn (also coaching house or staging inn) was a vital part of Europe's inland transport infrastructure until the development of the railway, providing a resting point for people and horses. The inn served the needs of travellers, for food, drink, and rest. The attached stables, staffed by hostlers, cared for the horses, including changing a tired team for a fresh one. Coaching inns were used by private travellers in their coaches, the public riding stagecoaches between one town and another, and (in England at least) the mail coach. Just as with roadhouses in other countries, although many survive, and some still offer overnight accommodation, in general coaching inns have lost their original function and now operate as ordinary pubs.\n\nCoaching inns stabled teams of horses for stagecoaches and mail coaches and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart but this depended very much on the terrain. Some English towns had as many as ten such inns and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the passengers. Barnet, Hertfordshire still has an unusually high number of historic pubs along its high street due to its former position on the Great North Road from London to the North of England.\n\nThere were many coaching inns in what is now central London. The only remaining one with the galleries to the bedrooms above is The George Inn, Southwark, owned by the National Trust and still run as a pub. Many have been demolished and plaques mark their location. The Nomura building close to the Museum of London on London Wall commemorates the \"Bull and Mouth\" Inn; Golden Cross House, opposite St Martin's in the Fields recalls the Golden Cross, Charing Cross coaching inn.\n\nHistoric inns in Oxford include The Bear Inn (originally established in 1242) and the Lamb & Flag.\n\nThose in Wales include the Black Boy Inn (built 1522) and the Groes Inn (1573). The Black Lion in Cardigan (established 1105) is probably the oldest Welsh coaching inn.\n\nA pair of coaching inns alongside the former A5 road or the old Roman road Watling Street in Stony Stratford (Buckinghamshire, England), named respectively 'The Cock' and 'The Bull', are said to have given rise to the term \"cock and bull stories.\" Coaches or the Mail coach would stop in the town on their way from London to the North and many a traveller's tall tale would be further embellished as it passed between the two hostelries, fuelled by ale and an interested audience. Hence any suspiciously elaborate tale would become a cock and bull story.\nThis is a cock and bull story in itself, however; as there is no evidence to suggest that this is where the phrase originated. The phrase, first recorded in 1621, may instead be an allusion to Aesop's fables, with their incredible talking animals. As this slightly predates coaching inns, the names of the two inns could have been a reference to \"Cock and Bull stories\" as to encourage the passing of such anecdotes within their doors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45619002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45619002", "title": "Copts in Egypt", "text": "Copts in Egypt\n\nCopts in Egypt refers to Coptic people born in or residing in Egypt.\n\nCoptic people are the largest ethno-religious minority in Egypt. The largest Coptic Christian group in Egypt is the Coptic Orthodox Church with a population of at least 7,200,000<ref name=\"U.S.Dept of State/Egypt\"></ref><ref name=\"FCO/Egypt/\"></ref> and the second is the Coptic Catholic Church with a population of 161,000 Other estimates of the ethnic Coptic population within Egypt range between 15 to 18 million.\n\nUnder Muslim rule, the ethnic Copts were cut off from the mainstream of Christianity, and were compelled to adhere to the Pact of Umar covenant, thus assigned to Dhimmi status. Their position improved dramatically under the rule of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century. He abolished the Jizya (a tax on non-Muslims) and allowed ethnic Copts to enroll in the army. Pope Cyril IV, 1854–61, reformed the church and encouraged broader Coptic participation in Egyptian affairs. Khedive Isma'il Pasha, in power 1863–79, further promoted the Copts. He appointed them judges to Egyptian courts and awarded them political rights and representation in government. They flourished in business affairs.\n\nSome ethnic Copts participated in the Egyptian national movement for independence and occupied many influential positions. Two significant cultural achievements include the founding of the Coptic Museum in 1910 and the Higher Institute of Coptic Studies in 1954. Some prominent Coptic thinkers from this period are Salama Moussa, Louis Awad and Secretary General of the Wafd Party Makram Ebeid.\n\nIn 1952, Gamal Abdel Nasser led some army officers in a coup d'état against King Farouk, which overthrew the Kingdom of Egypt and established a republic. Nasser's mainstream policy was pan-Arab nationalism and socialism. The ethnic Copts were severely affected by Nasser's nationalization policies, though they represented about 10–20% of the population. In addition, Nasser's pan-Arab policies undermined the Copts' strong attachment to and sense of identity about their Egyptian pre-Arab, and certainly non-Arab identity which resulted in permits to construct churches to be delayed along with Christian religious courts to be closed.\n\nMany Coptic intellectuals hold to \"Pharaonism,\" which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. However, some Western scholars today argue that Pharaonism was a late development shaped primarily by Orientalism, and doubt its validity.\n\nReligious freedom in Egypt is hampered to varying degrees by discriminatory and restrictive government policies. Coptic Christians, being the largest religious minority in Egypt, are also negatively affected. Copts have faced increasing marginalization after the 1952 coup d'état led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Until recently, Christians were required to obtain presidential approval for even minor repairs in churches. Although the law was eased in 2005 by handing down the authority of approval to the governors, Copts continue to face many obstacles and restrictions in building new churches. These restrictions do not apply for building mosques.\n\nThe Coptic community has been targeted by hate crimes resulting in Copts being victims of murder by Islamic extremists. The most significant was the 2000–01 El Kosheh attacks, in which Muslims and Christians were involved in bloody inter-religious clashes following a dispute between a Muslim and a Christian. \"Twenty Christians and one Muslim were killed after violence broke out in the town of el-Kosheh, south of Cairo\". International Christian Concern reported that in February 2001, Muslims burned a new Egyptian church and the homes of 35 Christians, and that in April 2001 a 14-year-old Egyptian Christian girl was kidnapped because her parents were believed to be harboring a person who had converted from Islam to Christianity.\n\nIn 2006, one person attacked three churches in Alexandria, killing one person and injuring 5–16. The attacker was not linked to any organisation and described as \"psychologically disturbed\" by the Ministry of Interior. In May 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported increasing waves of mob attacks by Muslims against ethnic Copts. Despite frantic calls for help, the police typically arrived after the violence was over. The police also coerced the Copts to accept \"reconciliation\" with their attackers to avoid prosecuting them, with no Muslims convicted for any of the attacks. In Marsa Matrouh, a Bedouin mob of 3,000 Muslims tried to attack the city's Coptic population, with 400 Copts having to barricade themselves in their church while the mob destroyed 18 homes, 23 shops and 16 cars.\n\nJournalist John R. Bradley writing around 2008 noted that \n\" ... other longstanding Coptic complaints include the under-representation of Christians in the police, judiciary, armed forces, civil service, government, and education system. There is also a virtual ban on access to state-controlled radio and television. One oft-cited example of official discrimination is a law that, until recently, required personal presidential approval to carry out even simple church repairs, such as fixing a toilet and which was blamed for delays of more than a decade in the issuing of permits to build churches. Mubarak eased the law in 2005, delegating such responsibility to local governors.\"\n\nMembers of U.S. Congress have expressed concern about \"human trafficking\" of Coptic women and girls who are victims of abductions, forced conversion to Islam, sexual exploitation and forced marriage to Muslim men.\n\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali was a Copt who served as Egypt's foreign minister under President Anwar Sadat. During Mubarak regime, there were two Copts serving on Egypt's governmental cabinet: Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali and Environment Minister Magued George. There was also one Coptic governor out of 25, that of the upper Egyptian governorate of Qena, and the first Coptic governor in a few decades. In addition, Naguib Sawiris, an extremely successful businessman, is a Copt who lived in Egypt during that era. In 2002, under the Mubarak government, Coptic Christmas (January 7) was recognized as an official holiday. However, many Copts continue to complain of being minimally represented in law enforcement, state security and public office, and of being discriminated against in the workforce on the basis of their religion. Most Copts do not support independence or separation movement from other Egyptians.\n\nToday (early 2018) there is one Copt on Egypt's governmental cabinet and no governors. Naguib Sawiris does not reside in Egypt anymore and there is not a single Coptic dean in state universities. \n\nWhile freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution, according to Human Rights Watch, \"Egyptians are able to convert to Islam generally without difficulty, but Muslims who convert to Christianity face difficulties in getting new identity papers and some have been arrested for allegedly forging such documents.\" The Coptic community, however, takes pains to prevent conversions from Christianity to Islam due to the ease with which Christians can often become Muslim. Public officials, being conservative themselves, intensify the complexity of the legal procedures required to recognize the religion change as required by law. Security agencies will sometimes claim that such conversions from Islam to Christianity (or occasionally vice versa) may stir social unrest, and thereby justify themselves in wrongfully detaining the subjects, insisting that they are simply taking steps to prevent likely social troubles from happening. In 2007, a Cairo administrative court denied 45 citizens the right to obtain identity papers documenting their reversion to Christianity after converting to Islam. However, in February 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the decision, allowing 12 citizens who had reverted to Christianity to re-list their religion on identity cards, but they will specify that they had adopted Islam for a brief period of time.\n\nThe Egyptian Census of 1897 reported the percentage of Non-Muslims in Urban Provinces as 14.7% (13.2% Christians, 1.4% Jews). The Egyptian Census of 1986 reported the percentage of Non-Muslims in Urban Provinces as 6.1% (5.7% Christians, 0% Jews). The decline in the Jewish representation is interpreted through the creation of the state of Israel, and the subsequent emigration of the Egyptian Jews. There is no explanation for a 55% decline in the percentage of Christians in Egypt. It has been suggested that Egyptian censuses held after 1952 have been politicized to under-represent the Christian population.\n\nIn August 2013, following the 3 July 2013 Coup and clashes between the military and Morsi supporters, there were widespread attacks on Coptic churches and institutions in Egypt by Sunni Muslims.\n\n\"USA Today\" reported that \"forty churches have been looted and torched, while 23 others have been attacked and heavily damaged\". The Facebook page of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party was \"rife with false accusations meant to foment hatred against Copts\", according to journalist Kirsten Powers. The Party's page claimed that the Coptic Church had declared \"war against Islam and Muslims\" and that \"The Pope of the Church is involved in the removal of the first elected Islamist president. The Pope of the Church alleges Islamic Sharia is backwards, stubborn, and reactionary.\" On August 15, nine Egyptian human rights groups under the umbrella group \"Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights\", released a statement saying, In December … Brotherhood leaders began fomenting anti-Christian sectarian incitement. The anti-Coptic incitement and threats continued unabated up to the demonstrations of June 30 and, with the removal of President Morsi … morphed into sectarian violence, which was sanctioned by … the continued anti-Coptic rhetoric heard from the group's leaders on the stage … throughout the sit-in.\n\nAn Egyptian court on February 25, 2016 convicted four Coptic Christian teenagers for contempt of Islam, after they appeared in a video mocking Muslim prayers.\n\nNearly all Egyptian Christians today are ethnic Copts, adherents of either the Coptic Orthodox Church or other Coptic churches.\n\n\n"}

Counterforce is the targeting of an opponent's military forces and facilities. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\", 2nd ed., records the first use of the word in 1660 and the first use in the modern sense in 1965, where it is described as a \"euphemism for attacking cities\".\n\nIn warfare, and in particular nuclear warfare, enemy targets can be divided into two general types: counterforce military targets and countervalue civilian targets. These terms were not used during the Second World War bombing of civilian populations and targets not directly military.\n\nThe rationale behind countervalue targeting is that when two sides have both achieved assured destruction capability—that is, when the nuclear arsenals of each side have the apparent ability to survive a wide range of counterforce attacks, and carry out a second strike in response—then, in an all-out nuclear war, the value of targeting the opponent's nuclear arsenal diminishes, and the value of targeting the opponent's cities and civilians increases. This line of reasoning, however, assumes that the opponent values its civilians over its military forces.\n\nOne view argues that countervalue targeting upholds nuclear deterrence because both sides are more likely to believe in each other's no first use policy. The line of reasoning is that if an aggressor strikes first with nuclear weapons against an opponent's countervalue targets, then, by definition, such an attack does not degrade the opponent's military capacity to retaliate.\n\nThe opposing view, however, counters that countervalue targeting is neither moral nor credible because if an aggressor should strike first with nuclear weapons against only a limited number of a defender's counterforce military targets, the defender should not retaliate in this situation against the aggressor's civilian populace.\n\nHowever, another position is that because they are the aggressor, and therefore are starting the conflict, they should not be treated with a \"gloves-on\" approach, as that would give further incentive to be an aggressor.\n\nThe intentional targeting of civilians with military force, including nuclear weapons, is prohibited by international law. In particular, the Fourth Geneva Convention prevents attacks on certain types of civilian targets and the Protocol I states that civilian objects are not acceptable military targets. (Not all states are party to Protocol I.) Nonetheless, \"proportional\" collateral damage is allowed, which could justify attacks on military objectives in cities. Many strategic military facilities like bomber airfields were located near cities. Command and control centers were located in Moscow, Washington D.C., and other cities.\n\n"}

During his second illness he was treated by Prof. Paul Flechsig (Leipzig University Clinic), Dr. Pierson (Lindenhof), and Dr. Guido Weber (Royal Public Asylum, Sonnenstein).\n\nSchreber was a successful and highly respected judge until middle age when the onset of his psychosis occurred. He woke up one morning with the thought that it would be pleasant to \"succumb\" to sexual intercourse as a woman. He was alarmed and felt that this thought had come from somewhere else, not from himself. He even hypothesized that the thought had come from a doctor who had experimented with hypnosis on him; he thought that the doctor had telepathically invaded his mind. He believed his primary psychiatrist, Prof. Paul Flechsig, had contact with him using a \"nerve-language\" of which Schreber said humans are unaware. He believed that hundreds of people's souls took special interest in him, and contacted his nerves by using \"divine rays\", telling him special information, or requesting things of him. During one of his stays at the Sonnenstein asylum, he concluded that there are \"fleeting-improvised-men\" in the world, which he believed were divinely fabricated men, as miracles to provide Schreber with \"play-with-humans\" in light of a depopulation of the world.\n\nAs his psychosis progressed, he believed that God was turning him into a woman, sending rays down to enact 'miracles' upon him, including little men to torture him. Schreber was released from psychiatric hospitals around 1902, shortly before the publication of his book. He reassumed his private activities, which he conducted very well up to 1907, when his mother died. He went then through a final hospitalisation. Schreber died in 1911, in an asylum.\n\nThough Schreber's book was made famous because of its value as a psychological memoir, the reason Schreber wrote the book was not for reasons of psychology. Schreber's purpose was expressed in its subtitle (which was not translated as part of the English edition, but fully reproduced inside it): \"In what circumstance can a person deemed insane be detained in an asylum against his declared will?\" Schreber, an accomplished jurist, wrote these memoirs in order to pose a legal question, namely, to what extent is it legitimate to keep someone like himself in an asylum when he expressly declares he desires his liberty.\n\nThe fundamental unit of Schreber's cosmology were \"nerves\", which composed both the human soul and the nature of God in relation to humanity. Each human soul was composed of nerves which derived from God who with \"His\" own nerves was the ultimate source of human existence. God's nerves and those of humanity existed parallel to one another except when the \"Order of the World\" was violated which constituted the fundamental premise of Schreber's memoirs- in which the two universes experienced dangerous \"nerve-contact\" with each other. For Schreber this was focused upon his personal and institutional relationship with Dr. Flechsig, who became a rebellious \"nerve specialist\" by virtue of his psychiatric power in contrast to the \"Omnipotence\" of God.\n\nThe peculiar universe of Schreber's was mediated by the activity of rays, which could assume a \"pure\" and \"impure\" relation; these rays could be controlled by Flechsig or emanated strictly from God, who sought to influence Schreber and his reality by \"divine miracles\". The rays had the capacity for independent activity, though they were distinguished from souls and nerves (generally identical) which emanated from other human beings deceased or living. Within Schreber's cosmology the universe as an observable reality, and the Sun especially, was a partially independent realm which God merely communicated through, using rays and miracles to influence at times when the \"Order of the World\" needed to be adjusted. Strictly speaking God only initiated nerve-contact with human beings through dreams or inspired states (in poetry, etc.), or when humans had become corpses and returned to the \"forecourts of Heaven\" after purification to rejoin the 'nerve soul' of God. However, the entire crisis which Schreber describes in his book is the dangerous combination between humanity and God within the mind of Schreber.\n\nSchreber's cosmology can be schematized in this way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Freud never interviewed Schreber himself, he read his \"Memoirs\" and drew his own conclusions from it in an essay entitled \"Psycho-Analytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)\" (1911). Freud thought that Schreber's disturbances resulted from repressed homosexual desires, which in infancy were oriented at his father and brother. Repressed inner drives were projected onto the outside world and led to intense hallucinations which were first centred on his physician Dr. Flechsig (projection of his feelings towards brother), and then around God (who represented Schreber's father, Daniel Gottlob Moritz Schreber). During the first phase of his illness Schreber was certain that Dr. Flechsig persecuted him and made direct attempts to murder his soul and change him into a woman (he had what Freud thought to be emasculation hallucinations, which were in fact, according to Schreber's words an \"unmanning\" (\"entmannung\") experience). In the next period of his ailment he was convinced that God and the order of things demanded of him that he must be turned into a woman so that he could be the sole object of sexual desire of God. Consideration of the Schreber case led Freud to revise received classification of mental disturbances. He argued that the difference between paranoia and dementia praecox is not at all clear, since symptoms of both ailments may be combined in any proportion, as in Schreber's case. Therefore, Freud concluded, it may be necessary to introduce a new diagnostic notion: paranoid dementia, which does justice to polymorphous mental disturbances such as those exhibited by the judge.\n\nFreud's interpretation has been contested by a number of subsequent theorists, most notably Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in their work \"Anti-Oedipus\" and elsewhere. Their reading of Schreber's \"Memoirs\" is a part of their wider criticism of familial orientation of psychoanalysis and it foregrounds the political and racial elements of the text; they see Schreber's written experience of reality abnormal only in its honesty about the experience of power in late capitalism. Elias Canetti also devoted the closing chapters of his theoretical magnum opus \"Crowds and Power\" to a reading of Schreber. Finally, Jacques Lacan's \"Seminar on the Psychoses\" and one of his \"écrits\" \"On a Question prior to Any Possible Treatment of Psychosis\" are predominantly concerned with reading and evaluating Schreber's text over-against Freud's original and originating interpretation.\n\nIn 1974, Morton Schatzman published \"Soul Murder\", in which he gave his own interpretation of Schreber's psychosis. Schatzman's interpretation was in turn based on W. G. Niederland's research from the '50s, (Niederland had previously worked with survivors of Nazi concentration camps). Schatzman had found child-rearing pamphlets written by Moritz Schreber, Daniel Schreber's father, which stressed the necessity of taming the rebellious savage beast in the child and turning him into a productive citizen. Many of the techniques recommended by Moritz Schreber were mirrored in Daniel Schreber's psychotic experiences. For example, one of the \"miracles\" described by Daniel Schreber was that of chest compression, of tightening and tightening. This can be seen as analogous to one of Moritz Schreber's techniques of an elaborate contraption which confined the child's body, forcing him to have a \"correct\" posture at the dinner table. Similarly, the \"freezing miracle\" might mirror Moritz Schreber's recommendation of placing the infant in a bath of ice cubes beginning at age three months. Daniel Paul Schreber's older brother, Daniel Gustav Schreber, committed suicide in his thirties. Han Israels argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman, claiming that Schreber's father had been unfairly criticized in the literature, in his 1989 book \"Schreber: Father and Son\".\n\nMore recently, Henry Zvi Lothane has argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman in his book \"In Defense of Schreber. Soul Murder and Psychiatry\". Lothane's Schreber research included the study of archival records concerning the relationship between Schreber and the other significant people in his life, including his wife and his doctors. On Lothane's account, the existing literature on Schreber as a rule (1) leaves substantial gaps in the historical records which careful archival research could in some measure fill; (2) leaves out psychoanalytically significant relationships, such as that between Schreber and his wife and (3) overstates the purportedly sadistic elements in Schreber's father's child-rearing techniques. Lothane's interpretation of Schreber also differs from previous texts in that he considers Schreber a worthwhile thinker.\n\n\n\n"}

She starred in two Fox series, \"Tru Calling\" and \"Dollhouse\". She is also known for her roles in films, including \"True Lies\", \"The New Guy\", \"Bring It On\", \"Wrong Turn\", and \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\", as well as her voice work on video games.\n\nDushku was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, the daughter of Philip Richard George Dushku, an administrator and teacher in the Boston Public Schools, and Judith Ann \"Judy\" Dushku (née Rasmussen), a political science professor. Dushku's father is an Albanian from the city of Korçë and her mother is of Danish and English descent.\n\nDushku has three brothers, and was raised in a religious family as a part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, although she no longer affiliates with the Church. She attended Beaver Country Day School in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and graduated from Watertown High School.\n\nDushku came to the attention of casting agents when she was 10. She was chosen in a five-month search for the lead role of Alice in the film \"That Night\". In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl alongside Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio in \"This Boy's Life\", a role that she said opened a lot of doors. The following year, she played the teenage daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in \"True Lies\". She had parts as Paul Reiser's daughter in \"Bye Bye Love\", as Cindy Johnson in \"Race the Sun\", and roles in the television movie \"Journey\" and the short film \"Fishing with George\".\n\nDushku intended to attend Suffolk University in Boston, where her mother taught at the time, but her agent asked her to submit a videotape audition for a show starring another of his clients, Sarah Michelle Gellar. After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local Claire's to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part, Faith on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". When she began her work on that series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive emancipation to work the production's long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of that show, jokingly said that she would sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku.\n\nAfter completing high school, Dushku returned to acting with the role of Faith Lehane on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", a Slayer much more troubled than the main character Buffy Summers. Though initially planned as a five-episode role, the character became so popular that she stayed on for the whole third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four, after which the remainder of her original story arc was played out as part of the first season of the \"Buffy\" spin-off series \"Angel\". Repentant and rededicated, Faith returned as a heroine in other episodes of \"Angel\" and in the last five episodes of \"Buffy\". \n\nAs an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from legions of prisoners. She said:\n\nI've been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and death row. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything – disgusting things that you don't even want to know about. And they send me pictures – \"Oh, here's a picture of me before I was incarcerated!\" – and there's some guy sat on the sofa with a bottle of beer and a moustache, and a big gut. It's so creepy. Way more creepy than \"Buffy\".\n\nIn 2000, Dushku starred in the hit cheerleader comedy \"Bring It On\". She followed that up with \"Soul Survivors\", reuniting her with \"Race the Sun\" co-star Casey Affleck. In 2001, she appeared in \"The New Guy\" with DJ Qualls and \"City by the Sea\" with Robert De Niro and James Franco. The latter film garnered attention from a wider adult audience and several good reviews. The same year, Kevin Smith invited Dushku to be a part of \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\".\n\nIn 2003, Dushku starred in the horror film \"Wrong Turn\" and \"The Kiss\", an independent comedy-drama. Starting that same year, she starred in a new Fox supernatural drama, \"Tru Calling\", where she played the main character, medical student Tru Davies. After having a grant pulled out from under her, Tru is forced to take a job at a local morgue where she discovers her power to \"re-live\" the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\" which would have been about Faith. She has had many roles as a \"bad girl\" in movies and relishes the opportunities. In an interview with \"Maxim\" in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, \"It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't have to deal with the consequences, because it's only acting.\"\n\nDushku starred in an Off-Broadway production entitled \"Dog Sees God\" from December 2005, playing \"Van's sister\", a character paralleled with Lucy Van Pelt from the \"Peanuts\" comic strip on which the play production is based. She quit in February 2006 along with other members of the cast amidst rumors of abuse from the producer, which were later dismissed.\n\nShe played the lead character on \"Nurses\", a hospital comedy-drama for Fox. This was the second Fox pilot in which she was cast, but not broadcast. She appeared in the Simple Plan music video, \"I'm Just a Kid\", as the band's love interest, as well as Nickelback's video for \"Rockstar\".\n\nOn October 1, 2005, she announced at Wizard World Boston that shooting had begun for \"Nobel Son\" in which she would star with Alan Rickman, Danny DeVito and Bill Pullman. The movie was released at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. Another project is \"On Broadway\", an independent movie filmed in her native Boston. The movie received positive reviews, with a few of them highlighting Dushku's performance.\n\nDushku has had roles in five video games. She voiced the role of Yumi Sawamura in the English language version of \"Yakuza\" for the PlayStation 2, which was published and developed by Sega, and released in September 2006. Dushku also stars as Shaundi, one of the lead characters in \"Saints Row 2\", which was developed by Volition, Inc. and published by THQ. It was released in North America on October 14, 2008, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. She was the voice talent for the role of Rubi Malone, the main character in the game \"WET\". She appeared at Spike TV's 2008 Video Game Awards in December 2008. Danielle Nicolet took over the role of Shaundi in \"\". She also voiced Megan McQueen in Champion Mode of the 2011 video game Fight Night Champion.\n\n\"Variety\" announced on August 2, 2006, that Dushku would co-star with Macaulay Culkin in \"Sex and Breakfast\", a dark comedy written and directed by Miles Brandman. A reviewer described Dushku as \"charming\" and giving the character \"an edge\". The movie was released in Los Angeles on November 30, 2007, and on DVD on January 22, 2008. She starred in \"Open Graves\", a 2008 horror-thriller about a satanic game co-starring Mike Vogel. She played the main character in \"The Thacker Case\" and \"The Alphabet Killer\", both thrillers based on real-life events, one of them directed by Rob Schmidt, with whom she had worked on \"Wrong Turn\". Both movies were released in 2008. \"The Alphabet Killer\" contains Dushku's first topless scene. The film earned mixed reviews, but reviewers praised Dushku's performance, commenting \"Eliza Dushku commands the screen but cannot reconcile the script's conflicted and increasingly idiotic agendas.\" She appeared in \"Bottle Shock\", a drama about Napa valley wine. The film was directed by Randall Miller, who helmed \"Nobel Son\".\n\nOn August 26, 2007, Dushku signed a development deal with Fox Broadcasting Company and 20th Century Fox. Under the pact, the network and the studio would develop projects tailor-made for the actress as well as approach her with existing pitches and scripts.\nSubsequently, it was announced on October 31 that Dushku had lured Joss Whedon, of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", back to TV, as they agreed to create a show called \"Dollhouse\". Dushku produced the show and played the main character, 'Echo', which aired on Fox during the 2008–09 TV Season.\nIn an interview, Dushku talked about how \"Dollhouse\" and her reconnection with Whedon came about:\n\nI invited Joss Whedon to lunch after I did the business deal with Fox. We'd had a cool relationship in the past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I was a little bit of a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.\nDushku described Whedon as \"my favorite genius ... favorite friend ... big brother ... and the only person out here I've ever wholeheartedly trusted, because he's never let me down.\" \"Dollhouse\" was renewed for a second season. The producers cited their confidence in the strength of Joss Whedon's fan base and high DVR numbers as their reasons for keeping the show. Fox cancelled \"Dollhouse\" on November 11, 2009. The show officially wrapped filming on the second and final season on December 16, 2009. Dushku was the voice actor for contract killer \"Rubi Malone\" in the action video game \"Wet\". She also secured exclusive rights to make \"The Perfect Moment\", a film based on the life of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and enlisted the help of Ondi Timoner.\n\nIn 2010, Dushku provided her voice for \"\" and appeared in the film \"Locked In\". She also guest-starred in an episode of CBS' comedy \"The Big Bang Theory\"\nwhich aired on November 4, 2010.\nIn 2011, Dushku featured alongside Jayson Floyd in \"One Shot\", a short action clip on YouTube directed by and starring Freddie Wong, which was released on May 13, 2011. In August of the same year, Dushku visited Albania with a crew from the Travel Channel and Lonely Planet to film a documentary entitled \"Dear Albania\", promoting tourism in her father's country of origin.\n\nDushku had a lead role in an online animated \"motion comic\" series, titled \"Torchwood: Web of Lies\", based on the BBC series \"\". In June 2012, Dushku starred with Katie Cassidy, Gina Gershon and Michelle Trachtenberg in \"The Scribbler\" directed by John Suits and produced by Gabriel Cowan.\nIn 2013, she was cast as Patricia Holm in a pilot film for a proposed TV revival series of \"The Saint\", but the series was not commissioned. In July 2017 the pilot was released on digital HD/VOD.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Dushku voiced the role of She-Hulk in the Disney XD animated series \"Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.\".

Additionally, her production company in association with IM Global Television was reported to be developing Glen Cook's \"The Black Company\" series of books for a television series with Dushku starring as The Lady.\n\nDushku was raised as a Mormon, as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nDushku visited her father's family in Albania in 2006 after receiving an invitation from Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. She visited Kosovo and received an Albanian Eagle tattoo on the back of her neck. While on her second visit to Albania in 2011, she applied for Albanian citizenship and obtained the Albanian passport and ID Card. She became an honorary citizen of Tirana, and was given the honorary title of Tirana Ambassador of Culture and Tourism in the World by Tirana mayor Lulzim Basha. Additionally, she was given honorary citizen status in her father's home town of Korçë, Albania.\n\nShe is the founder and CEO of Boston Diva Productions and serves on the board of directors of the THRIVEGulu organization (The Trauma Healing and Reflection Center in Gulu), an organization dedicated to helping the survivors of war (including former child soldiers) in Northern Uganda.

It was announced on June 24, 2014, that the pair had split.\n\nDushku announced in December 2011, that she had decided to switch to a vegan diet after watching the documentary \"Forks over Knives\". In December 2014 she said on her Twitter page she was no longer a vegetarian. Dushku, who had originally intended to attend college in Boston before her big break on \"Buffy\" altered those plans, announced in March 2014 at the Emerald City Comicon that she would be attending college later that year.\n\nDushku previously resided in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California. On June 22, 2014, \"The Boston Globe\" reported that Dushku had left Los Angeles, moved back to Boston, and was planning to attend college.

Paanchi had been executed for treason when he refused to accept the election of his brother Pahoran II to the judgment seat and then tried to incite a revolution. One of his supporters, Kishkumen (), assassinated Pahoran in retaliation. Kishkumen and his associates entered into a pact to keep the assassin's identity a secret.\n\nA man, Gadianton, became the leader of Kishkumen's secret group. He arranged for Kishkumen to assassinate Chief Judge Helaman II by promising that if Gadianton were made chief judge, he would appoint the other members of the band to positions of authority. Kishkumen was apprehended and killed by one of Helaman's servants, and Gadianton and his followers, fearing the same fate, fled into the wilderness.\n\nWithin 25 years, Gadianton's band had grown into a large criminal organization known as \"Gadianton's robbers and murderers\", with both Nephites and Lamanites among its members. In 26 BC, the Gadianton robbers assassinated Chief Judge Cezoram and his son.\n\nThe Lamanites made every effort to eradicate the Gadianton robbers among them. The Nephites, in contrast, began to join the band in larger and larger numbers until most them were members. Members swore to protect one another and identified one another by means of secret signs and secret words. By 24 BC, the entire Nephite government was under the control of the Gadiantons.\n\nAround 20 BC, Chief Judge Seezoram was murdered by his brother, Seantum; both of them were members of the Gadianton band. The murder was announced and the culprit identified by Nephi the son of Helaman. Nephi's knowledge of the event was believed by many to be evidence of his prophetic powers. When a famine struck the area a few years later, the people believed that God was behind it, and they reacted by repenting and cracking down on the Gadiantons. The society was completely eradicated, and their secret plans were buried into the earth.\n\nHowever, in 12 BC, a group of disaffected Nephites recovered the secret plans and re-established the Gadianton. This time, instead of infiltrating mainstream Nephite society, the group established bases in the mountains and the wilderness and periodically raided Nephite and Lamanite cities by guerrilla warfare. It continued to increase in power, and by 13 AD, it had caused so much destruction that the Nephites and Lamanites united and declared war on the Gadiantons.\n\nThe Gadiantons initially had the upper hand in the war, and in AD 16, the Gadianton leader, Giddianhi, sent a letter to the Nephite governor Lachoneus demanding surrender. The letter is reproduced in the Book of Mormon and provides a rare look at the Gadianton robbers, as seen by themselves. Giddianhi closes with these words: \"I am the governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down unto us.” In AD 21, however, the Nephites defeated the Gadiantons, killing both Giddianhi and his successor, Zemnarihah, and the society was again destroyed.\n\nIn around 245, a group of Nephites once again resurrected the old oaths and secrets and re-established the Gadianton robbers. Over the course of the next 50 years, they spread all over the land and became extremely wealthy.\n\nThe Gadiantons later united with the Lamanites, and the combined force completely wiped out the Nephites.\n\n"}
{"id": "494527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494527", "title": "Genrikh Yagoda", "text": "Genrikh Yagoda\n\nGenrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda (7 November 1891 – 15 March 1938), born Yenokh Gershevich Iyeguda was a secret police official who served as director of the NKVD, the Soviet Union's security and intelligence agency, from 1934 to 1936. Appointed by Joseph Stalin, Yagoda supervised the arrest, show trial, and execution of the Old Bolsheviks Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, climactic events of the Great Purge. Yagoda supervised the construction of the White Sea–Baltic Canal with Naftaly Frenkel, using penal labor from the GULAG system, during which many laborers died.\n\nLike many Soviet NKVD officers who conducted political repression, Yagoda himself became ultimately a victim of the Purge. He was demoted from the directorship of the NKVD in favor of Nikolai Yezhov in 1936 and arrested in 1937. Charged with the crimes of wrecking, espionage, Trotskyism and conspiracy, Yagoda was a defendant at the Trial of the Twenty-One, the last of the major Soviet show trials of the 1930s. Following his confession at the trial, Yagoda was found guilty and shot.\n\nYagoda was born in Rybinsk into a Jewish family. The son of a jeweller, trained as a statistician, who worked as a chemist's assistant, he claimed that he was an active revolutionary from the age of 14, when he worked as a compositor on an underground printing press in Nizhni-Novgorod, and that at the age of 15 he was a member of a fighting squad in the Sormovo district of Nizhni-Novgorod, during the violent suppression of the 1905 revolution. One of his brothers was killed during the fighting in Sormovo; the other was shot for taking part in a mutiny in a regiment during the war with Germany. He said he joined the Bolsheviks in Nizhni-Novgorod at the age of 16 or 17, and was arrested and sent into exile in 1911. Before his arrest, he married Ida Averbakh, one of whose uncles, Yakov Sverdlov, was a prominent Bolshevik, and another, Zinovy Peshkov, was the adopted son of the writer Maxim Gorky. In 1913, he moved to St Petersburg to work at the Putilov steel works. After the outbreak of war, he joined the army, and was wounded in action.\nThere is another version of his early career, told in the memoirs of the former NKVD officer Aleksandr M. Orlov, who alleged that Yagoda invented his early revolutionary career and did not join the Bolsheviks until 1917, and that his deputy Mikhail Trilisser was dismissed from the service for trying to expose the lie. It can be assumed that this was gossip put around by Yagoda's successors after his fall from power.\n\nAfter the October Revolution of 1917, Yagoda rose rapidly through the ranks of the \"Cheka\" (the predecessor of the OGPU and NKVD) to become the second deputy of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Cheka, in September 1923. After Dzerzhinsky's appointment as chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy in January 1924, Yagoda became the real manager of the State Political Directorate (OGPU), as the deputy chairman Vyacheslav Menzhinsky had little authority because of his serious illness. In 1924, he joined the USSR's head of government, Alexei Rykov on a ship tour of the Volga. An American journalist who was allowed to join them on the trip described Yagoda as \"a spare, slightly-tanned, trim looking, youngish officer\" adding that it was \"difficult to associate terror with the affable and modest person\". By contrast, the chemist Vladimir Ipatieff met Yagoda briefly in Moscow in 1918 and thought that \"it was unusual for a young men in his early twenties to be so unpleasant. I felt then that it would be unlucky for me or anyone else ever to fall into his hands.\" When he saw him again in 1927, \"his appearance had changed considerably: he had grown fatter and looked much older and very dignified and important.\"\n\nThough Yagoda appears to have known Joseph Stalin since 1918, when they were both stationed in Tsaritsyn during the civil war, \"he was never Stalin's man\" When Stalin ordered that the Soviet Union's entire rural population were to be forced onto collective farms, Yagoda is reputed to have sympathised with Bukharin and Rykov, his opponents on the right of the communist party. Nikolai Bukharin claimed in a leaked private conversation in July 1928 that \"Yagoda and Trilisser are with us\", but once it became apparent that the right was losing the power struggle, Yagoda switched allegiance. In the contemptuous opinion of Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, Yagoda \"traded his personal views for the sake of his career\" and degenerated into a \"criminal\" and a \"miserable coward\".\n\nYagoda continued to be effective head of the OGPU until July 1931, when the little known Old Bolshevik Ivan Akulov was appointed First Deputy Chairman, and Yagoda was demoted to the post of Second Deputy. Akulov was dismissed and Yagoda reinstated in October 1932, After Yagoda's fall, one of his former colleagues confessed: \"We met Akulov with violent hostility...the entire party organisation in the OGPU was devoted to sabotaging Akulov.\" Stalin must have agreed to his reinstatement with ill grace, because four years later he accused the OGPU/NKVD of being \"four years behind\" in rooting out the supposed Trotskyite anti-Soviet conspiracy, although Yagoda had been complicit in the execution of one of Trotsky's sympathisers, Yakov Blumkin, and in sending others to the GULAG, the system of forced labour created under his supervision.\n\nAs deputy head of the OGPU, Yagoda organized the building of the White Sea–Baltic Canal using forced labor at breakneck speed between 1931 and 1933 at the cost of huge casualties. For his contribution to the canal's construction he was later awarded the Order of Lenin. The construction of the Moscow-Volga Canal was started under his watch, but only completed after his fall by his successor Nikolai Yezhov.\n\nYagoda supervised the deportations, confiscations, mass arrests and executions that accompanied the forced collectivisation, and was one of the people responsible for the Holodomor, which resulted in the deaths of at least 7.5 million people. In March 1934, he was rewarded by being made a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nYagoda had founded a secret poison laboratory of OGPU that was at disposal of Stalin. One of the victims became his own NKVD boss, Vyacheslav Menzhinsky. He was slowly poisoned during two weeks by two assistants of Yagoda Menzhinsky's death was followed one day later by death of Max Peshkov, the son of Maxim Gorky, the doyen of Soviet literature. Yagoda had been cultivating Gorky as a potentially useful contact since 1928, and employed Gorky's secretary, Pyotr Kryuchkov, as a spy. \"Whenever Gorky met Stalin or other members of the Politburo, Yagoda would visit Kryuchkov's flat afterward, demanding a full account of what had been said. He took to visiting public baths with Kryuchkov. One day in 1932, Yagoda handed his valuable spy $4,000 to buy a car.\" He had developed an obsession with Max Peshkov's wife, Timoshka, and visited her daily when she was newly widowed, though her mother denied that they were ever lovers. According to Arkady Vaksberg and other researchers, Yagoda poisoned Maksim Gorky and his son on the orders from Joseph Stalin.\n\nOn 10 July 1934, two months after Menzhinsky's death, Joseph Stalin appointed Yagoda People's Commissar for Internal Affairs, a position that included the oversight of both the regular and the secret police, the NKVD. Yagoda worked closely with Andrei Vyshinsky in organizing the first Moscow Show Trial, which resulted in the prosecution and subsequent execution of former Soviet politicians Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in August 1936 as part of Stalin's Great Purge. The Red Army high command was not spared and its ranks were thinned by Yagoda, as a precursor to the later and more extensive purge in the Russian military. More than a quarter of a million people were arrested during the 1934–1935 period; the GULAG system was vastly expanded under his stewardship, and penal labor became a major developmental resource in the Soviet economy.\n\nStalin became increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's performance. In the middle of 1936, Stalin received a report from Yagoda detailing the unfavorable public reaction abroad to the show trials and the growing sympathy among the Soviet population for the executed defendants. The report enraged Stalin, interpreting it as Yagoda's advice to stop the show trials and in particular to abandon the planned purge of Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Marshal of the Soviet Union and the former commander in chief of the Red Army. Stalin was already unhappy with Yagoda's services, mostly due to the mismanagement of Kirov's assassination and his failure to fabricate \"proofs\" of ties between Kamenev and Zinoviev and the Okhrana (the tsarist security organization). As one Soviet official put it, \"The Boss forgets nothing.\"\n\nOn 25 September 1936, Stalin sent a telegram (co-signed by Andrei Zhdanov) to the members of the Politburo. The telegram read:\n\n\"We consider it absolutely necessary and urgent that Comrade Yezhov be appointed to head the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs. \"Yagoda has obviously proved unequal to the task of exposing the Trotskyite-Zinovievite bloc.\" The GPU was four years late in this matter. All party heads and the most of the NKVD agents in the region are talking about this.\"\n\nA day later, he was replaced by Yezhov, who managed the main purges during 1937–1938. Yagoda was demoted to the post of People's Commissar for Post and Telegraph.\n\nIn March 1937, Yagoda was arrested on Stalin's orders. Yezhov announced Yagoda's arrest for diamond smuggling, corruption, and working as a German agent since joining the party in 1917. Yezhov even blamed Yagoda of an attempt to assassinate him by sprinkling mercury around his office. He was accused of poisoning Maxim Gorky and his son. It was discovered that Yagoda's two Moscow apartments and his dacha contained 3,904 pornographic photos, 11 pornographic films, 165 pornographically carved pipes, one dildo, and the two bullets that killed Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yezhov took over the apartments. He had spent four million rubles decorating his three homes, boasting that his garden had \"2,000 orchids and roses.\"\n\nYagoda was found guilty of treason and conspiracy against the Soviet government at the Trial of the Twenty-One in March 1938. He denied he was a spy, but admitted most other charges. Solzhenitsyn describes Yagoda as expecting clemency from Stalin after the show trial: \"Just as though Stalin had been sitting right there in the hall, Yagoda confidently and insistently begged him directly for mercy: 'I appeal to you! \"For you\" I built two great canals!'\". \n\nYagoda was summarily shot soon after the trial. His wife Ida Averbakh was executed in 1938. His sister, Lilya, was arrested on 7 May 1937, and shot on 16 July. His brother-in-law, Leopold Averbakh, was shot in August. In 1988, on the 50th anniversary of the trial, the Soviet authorities belatedly cleared all of the other 20 defendants of any criminal offence, admitting that the entire trial was built on false confessions. Yagoda was the only defendant not to be posthumously rehabilitated.\n\n\n"}

Uther asks for Merlin's aid in pursuing her, and Merlin concocts some drugs that disguise Uther in the form of Gorlois.

Carville gained national attention for his work as the lead strategist of the successful presidential campaign of then-Arkansas governor Bill Clinton. Carville also worked as a co-host of CNN's \"Crossfire\". After Crossfire, he appeared on CNN's news program \"The Situation Room\". As of 2009, he hosts a weekly program on XM Radio titled \"60/20 Sports\" with Luke Russert, son of Tim Russert who hosted NBC's \"Meet The Press\". He is married to Libertarian political consultant Mary Matalin. In 2009, he began teaching political science at Tulane University.\n\nIn 2014, Carville joined Fox News Channel as a contributor.\n\nCarville, the oldest of eight children, was born on October 25, 1944, in Carville, Louisiana, the son of Lucille (née Normand), a former school teacher who sold \"World Book Encyclopedia\" door-to-door, and Chester James Carville, a postmaster as well as owner of a general store. The town of Carville was named after his paternal grandfather, Louis Arthur Carville, the postmaster. Carville attended Ascension Catholic High School in Donaldsonville, Louisiana. Louis Arthur's mother, Octavia Dehon was of Belgian parentage and had married John Madison Carville, described in a biography as \"Irish-born\" and a \"carpetbagger\", both of whom established the general store operated by the family in Carville in 1882. He was born in Ireland in 1847 and his father, Alexander Carville, in 1810.\n\nHe received his undergraduate and Juris Doctor degrees from Louisiana State University (LSU). Carville is a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity.\n\nCarville spent two years serving in the United States Marine Corps, achieving the rank of Corporal, and later worked as a high school teacher. Before entering politics, Carville worked as a litigator at a Baton Rouge law firm from 1973 to 1979.\n\nCarville was trained in consulting by Gus Weill, who in 1958 had opened the first advertising firm which specialized in political campaigns in the state capital in Baton Rouge.\n\nPrior to the Clinton campaign, Carville and consulting partner Paul Begala gained other well-known political victories, including the gubernatorial triumphs of Robert Casey of Pennsylvania in 1986, and Zell Miller of Georgia in 1990, and Brereton Jones of Kentucky in 1991. But it was in 1991 when Carville and Begala rose to national attention, leading appointed incumbent Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania back from a 40-point poll deficit over White House hand-picked candidate Dick Thornburgh. It was during Wofford's campaign that the \"it's the economy, stupid\" strategy used by Bill Clinton in 1992 was first implemented.\n\nIn 1992, Carville helped lead Bill Clinton to a win against George H. W. Bush in the presidential election. In 1993, Carville was honored as Campaign District Manager of the Year by the American Association of Political Consultants. His role in the Clinton campaign was documented in the feature-length Academy Award-nominated film \"The War Room\".\n\nOne of the formulations he used in that campaign has entered common usage, derived from a list he posted in the war room to help focus himself and his staff, with these three points:\n\nAfter 1992 Carville stopped working on domestic campaigns, stating that he would bring unneeded publicity. He then worked on a number of foreign campaigns, including those of Tony Blair – then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – during the 2001 general election; Ehud Barak of Israel's Labor Party (at the suggestion of Clinton, who had grown frustrated with Benjamin Netanyahu's intransigence in the peace process) in the 1999 Knesset election; and the Liberal Party of Canada. In 2002, Carville helped Bolivian Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada win the presidency in Bolivia, while working as a Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) strategist. This was portrayed in the documentary \"Our Brand Is Crisis\".\n\nIn 2004, he was brought in for last-minute consulting on John Kerry's presidential campaign, but he did not play a major role.\n\nIn 2005, Carville taught a semester of the course \"Topics in American Politics\" at Northern Virginia Community College. Among the guests he had come speak to the class were Al Hunt, Mark Halperin, Senator George Allen, George Stephanopoulos, Karl Strubel, Stan Greenberg, Tony Blankley, representatives from the Motion Picture Association of America, and James Fallows.\n\nIn 2006, Carville switched gears from politics to sports and became a host on a sports show called \"60/20 Sports\" on XM Satellite Radio with Luke Russert, son of NBC journalist Tim Russert. The show is an in-depth look at the culture of sports based on the ages of the two hosts (60 and 20).\n\nAfter the Democrats' victory in the 2006 midterm election, Carville criticized Howard Dean as Democratic National Committee Chair, calling for his ouster, as he believed Dean had not spent enough money. In late November 2006, Carville proposed a truce of sorts.\n\nCarville was the executive producer of the 2006 film \"All the King's Men\", starring Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins, which is loosely based on the life of Louisiana Governor Huey Long.\n\nCarville had believed that Al Gore, whom he helped put in the White House as vice president in 1992, would run for president in 2008. This prediction did not come true.\n\nOn March 4, 2009, \"Politico\" reported that Carville, Paul Begala, and Rahm Emanuel were the architects of the Democratic Party's strategy to cast conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh as the face of the Republican Party. Carville was particularly critical of Limbaugh for saying he wanted Barack Obama to \"fail\".\n\nAfghan presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani hired Carville as a campaign advisor in July 2009. Carville said that the 2009 Afghan presidential election is \"probably the most important election held in the world in a long time,\" and he called his new job \"probably the most interesting project I have ever worked in my life.\" Carville, who works for Ghani \"pro bono\", when asked about similarities between politics in Afghanistan and politics in Louisiana, responded: \"Yeah, I felt a little bit at home, to be honest with you.\"\n\nIn 2010, Carville worked as senior advisor for the campaign of Colombian presidential candidate Juan Manuel Santos.\n\nHe is acting as advisor for Daniel Scioli (Governor of Buenos Aires) re-election campaign.\n\nHe is a regular contributor with Stan Greenberg to the weekly Carville-Greenberg Memo at The National Memo.\n\nAs an advisor to Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Carville told \"The New York Times\" on March 22, 2008, that New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who had just endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination, was comparable to Judas Iscariot. It was \"an act of betrayal,\" said Carville. \"Mr. Richardson's endorsement came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for 30 pieces of silver, so I think the timing is appropriate, if ironic,\" Mr. Carville said, referring to Holy Week. Governor Richardson had served in President Bill Clinton's administration as both United States Ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of Energy, and Carville believed that Richardson owed an endorsement to Senator Clinton in exchange for being offered those posts by her husband. Carville also claimed that Richardson assured many in the Clinton campaign that he would at least remain neutral and abstain from taking sides. Richardson denied Carville's account, arguing that he had not made any promises to remain neutral. Richardson claims that his decision to endorse Obama was \"clinched\" by his speech on race relations following the swirl of controversy surrounding Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright. Carville went on to note,\"I doubt if Governor Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future,\" Carville said, but \"I've had my say...I got one in the wheelhouse and I tagged it.\"\n\nEven as Clinton's campaign began to lose steam, Carville remained both loyal and positive in his public positions, rarely veering off message and stoutly defending the candidate. But on May 13, 2008, a few hours before the primary in West Virginia, Carville remarked to an audience at Furman University in South Carolina, \"I'm for Senator Clinton, but I think the great likelihood is that Obama will be the nominee.\" The moment marked a shift from his previous and often determinedly optimistic comments about the state of Clinton's campaign.\n\nAfter Barack Obama's clear lead for victory in the Democratic presidential campaign on June 3, James Carville said he was ready to open up his wallet to help Obama build a political war chest to take on John McCain in November.\n\nCarville is married to Republican-turned-Libertarian political consultant Mary Matalin, who worked for George H. W. Bush on his 1992 presidential reelection campaign. Carville and Matalin were married in New Orleans in October 1993. They have two daughters: Matalin Mary \"Matty\" Carville and Emerson Normand\n\"Emma\" Carville.\n\nIn 2008, Carville and Matalin relocated their family from Virginia to New Orleans. Carville joined the faculty of Louisiana State University's Manship School of Mass Communication in January 2017.\n\nPolitics\n\nChildren's Fiction\n\n\nhttp://www.lsu.edu/mediacenter/news/2017/09/26carville.eb.php\n\n\n"}

Each week, one or more of the HouseGuests are evicted by votes by the remaining HouseGuests until the winner is left.\n\nAmber Nichol Borzotra (born January 13, 1988), 26, is a German American model and esthetician from North Hollywood, California. She applied by attending an open casting call in Los Angeles, but she had said she was unfamiliar with the show. Originally from Knoxville, Tennessee, Amber was in the first group to enter the house. Amber was one of two women involved in the \"Bomb Squad\" alliance formed by Caleb and Frankie. During her time in the house, Amber received unwanted romantic attention from Caleb, who he referred to as his \"Queen\". She won the Head of Household competition in Week 2 but was dethroned after her nominees, Hayden and Nicole, won the Battle of the Block competition. In week 3, Amber was nominated with Donny by Nicole, who won the Head of Household competition. However, Amber and Donny won the Battle of the Block competition and secured her safety for the week, although Caleb threw the competition to ensure Amber's safety. Following Devin's eviction, Amber and Caleb were exiled from the Bomb Squad (with Frankie claiming they were \"too much drama\"), while the remaining members formed a new alliance called \"The Detonators\". Amber was seen as a physical threat by most of the guys and quickly became a target of the Detonators after telling Christine (unaware she was a member of the alliance) about a plan to possibly form a girl's alliance with her and Nicole and get some of the guys out (her main target being Zach), which backfired when Christine told the Detonators of Amber's plan. Zach and Frankie quickly put a plan in motion to backdoor Amber after they won the Head of Household competition. Annoyed at his unreciprocated feelings for Amber and still unaware of the new alliance, a frustrated Caleb later approached Frankie with a plan to put Amber on the block as a scare tactic, unaware a plan had already been set in motion to backdoor her. Amber was named the replacement nominee against Jocasta by Frankie (with Caleb thinking it was his idea) after Hayden won the Power of Veto and took Victoria off the block. Christine later attempted to keep Amber in the game by reassuring the Detonators that Zach was no longer Amber's target and that she wanted to put Caleb on the block after thinking he was responsible for her being the replacement nominee, however this also backfired on Amber as the Detonators relayed this information to Caleb, and her fate was sealed even further when Zach twisted Amber's words about her relationship with Caleb and relayed this information to him. Amber was evicted on Day 42 in a unanimous vote of 9-0, finishing in 12th place.\n\nBrittany Christine Martinez (née Thompson) (born February 1, 1985), 29, is an event coordinator from Torrance, California. She is a recently single mother of three. Originally from Long Beach, California, she entered the house with the second group. Unlike the other HouseGuests, Brittany was not aware of the show's existence until she was recruited at a bar in Hermosa Beach. She was nominated alongside Victoria in Week 1 by Frankie but won the \"Battle of the Block\" competition, securing her safety and dethroning Frankie in the process. The following week, after Devin held a house meeting telling everyone how he had accused Donny of not being who he said he is and had forced Caleb to nominate him, Brittany realized that what Caleb had said about nominating those that were eliminated first in the previous Head of Household competition was a lie and said so. Frankie and Caleb later informed Devin about what Brittany had said, to his annoyance. Brittany was nominated again alongside Paola, with Brittany being Devin's main target, which became official after they lost the Battle of the Block to Hayden and Nicole. After Devin won the Power of Veto, Brittany pleaded for him to use the veto on her, noting their similarities for being single parents. After a change of heart, Devin used the veto to take Brittany off the block and nominated Zach in her place. In week 4, Brittany was nominated by Cody, after Frankie told him that Brittany had said she felt unsafe being the only girl not to \"suck up\" to Cody. Derrick also encouraged Cody to target Brittany because she was the only person not on their side of the house that they could manipulate. Brittany and Victoria did not manage to win the Battle of the Block competition, leaving them as the official nominees. Losing the veto, she was made an official nominee. Brittany was voted out in a unanimous vote of 10-0 against Donny on Day 35, coming in 13th place.\n\nCaleb Matthew Reynolds (born November 27, 1987), 27, is a hunting guide from Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He also has modeling experience. Many people refer to him as \"Beast Mode Cowboy.\" Caleb was recruited after applying for The Amazing Race with his friend. Originally from Dallas, Texas, he was in the second group to enter the house and became the Head of Household after winning the \"Over the Coals\" competition. He later became the first official HoH after his nominees (Donny and Paola) failed to win the \"Battle of the Block\" competition. Caleb created the \"Bomb Squad\" alliance with his fellow HoH Frankie, which includes Amber, Christine, and all of the men except Donny and Hayden. In week 3, Caleb volunteered for Derrick to nominate him so Derrick and Nicole could backdoor Devin; Derrick then nominated Caleb and Jocasta. In week 6, Caleb was nominated alongside Victoria by Donny, who was HOH along with Nicole. However, Caleb and Victoria won Battle Of The Block, dethroning Donny and securing their safety from the block. However he had to endure three punishments, which included eating slop for 2 weeks, Adam and Eve (chained to Victoria in leafy costumes for 48 hours) and one had to shave their head. On Day 49, Caleb won his second HOH of the season making the him the first person to hold the title twice officially. He nominated Hayden and Donny for eviction. However, Donny won the POV and Caleb named Hayden's showmantic partner Nicole as the replacement nominee, resulting in Hayden's eviction. On Day 70, Caleb won his third HOH of the season, which was an endurance competition making him the first person to be HOH officially three times unlike Frankie and Nicole who have four and three HOHs respectively and were dethroned twice. He nominated Nicole and Christine for eviction. Christine won POV, which meant that Caleb named Victoria the replacement nominee alongside Nicole, in hopes that Nicole would be evicted a second time. In Week 12, Caleb won his fourth HOH of the season. Only counting official or permanent HOHs, he is tied with Drew Daniels, Janelle Pierzina, Hayden Moss, Rachel Reilly, Ian Terry and Aaryn Gries for the most HOHs in a single season. He then nominated Frankie and Victoria for eviction. In Week 12, HOH Derrick nominated Caleb and Victoria for eviction. Cody won the veto and decided not to use it, leaving the nominations the same. On Day 90, Caleb was evicted by Cody, coming in 4th Place. Caleb had a well known unrequited crush on Amber which many other housemates regard as \"creepy and obsessive\". Caleb was disliked by several houseguests at the beginning of the game, especially Cody and Zach due to his obsession with Amber but obtained a friendship with the two. He also had close friendships with Derrick, Brittany, Devin, Donny, Frankie and Amber despite his obsession with her. Caleb voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. Prior to the premiere, Caleb created controversy after an Instagram post surfaced which voiced his disapproval of U.S. President Barack Obama. In addition, it was revealed that he used homophobic slurs in his responses and referred to Obama as a Muslim monkey. The comments were made public after TMZ covered the story shortly before he entered the house.\n\nChristine Nicole Brecht (née Varner) (born May 8, 1991), 23, is a barista from Tucson, Arizona. Christine originally applied by sending a video to casting as well as attending an open casting call. Christine is one of the two women in the \"Bomb Squad\" alliance formed by Caleb and Frankie. She also has formed a strong bond with Nicole, a fellow superfan of the show. However, as the game progressed, she began to turn on her. She was also disliked by numerous houseguests as the game progressed, including her former ally Nicole, Hayden, Victoria, Donny, Zach, Derrick and Caleb. Christine is a member of the Detonators alliance. In week 5, Christine was nominated alongside Nicole by Zach, who was HOH along with Frankie. However, Christine and Nicole won the Battle Of The Block competition, dethroning Zach and securing her safety for the week. Christine had a very close relationship inside the Big Brother House with fellow housemate, Cody, despite being married. In week 6, Christine won her first Power of Veto. In Week 7, Christine became HoH. She nominated Donny and Zach for eviction. Donny and Zach lost the BOB competition and remained on the block. Zach won POV and removed himself from the block. Christine named her former ally Nicole as the replacement nominee and Nicole was evicted by a unanimous vote. On Day 71, Christine was nominated alongside Nicole by HOH Caleb. On Day 72, Christine won her second POV of the season. In Week 11, Christine was nominated alongside Victoria by HOH Derrick on Double Eviction night. Frankie won the POV and chose to keep the nominations the same. As a result, Christine was evicted by a 3-0 vote and received boos describing as the loudest boos in Big Brother history. She is the sixth member of the Jury. She came in 6th place.\n\nCody Christopher Calafiore (born December 13, 1990), 23, is a sales account executive from Howell, New Jersey. He also has modeling experience. Cody was recruited to be on the show. Originally from Hackensack, New Jersey, he entered the house with the first group. He was a part of the \"Bomb Squad\" alliance with most of the men in the house. He initially won the Head of Household in Week 2, but his victory was rescinded after producers saw him touch the ground before he hit the buzzer. In week 4, Cody won HOH alongside Frankie and nominated Victoria and Brittany. Cody's nominees lost the Battle Of The Block competition, therefore, Cody remained HOH and Frankie was dethroned. In Week 8, Cody was nominated alongside Caleb by HOH Frankie. Cody and Caleb lost the BOTB competition and remained on the block as a result. Cody was then nominated aside his former ally and friend Zach after Frankie used the POV on Caleb and backdoored Zach. Cody survived eviction. In Week 9, Cody won his second HOH and became the first solo HOH of the season. He nominated Donny and Nicole for eviction. The same week, Cody won his first Power of Veto and chose to keep the nominations the same, which resulted in Donny's eviction. In Week 11, Cody was nominated alongside Victoria by Frankie who was the HOH. But due to the twist, Cody (and Victoria) got off the block. In Week 12, Cody won his second Power of Veto of the season. On Day 97, Cody won the final HOH of the season after winning on a tiebreaker question. He evicted Victoria and took his ally Derrick to the final 2. Cody became the runner-up of the season, losing to Derrick on a 7-2 vote, only receiving votes from Donny and Jocasta. Cody's closest ally in the game was Derrick and he had a Final 2 alliance with him called \"The Hitmen\", which ultimately came true. Cody also had close friendships in the house with Christine, Frankie, Zach, Donny, Brittany, Nicole and Devin. Although he heavily despised Caleb at first due to his obsession with Amber, Cody and him formed a strong bond in later stages of the game. Cody is tied with Frankie Grande, Shane Meaney, and Frank Eudy for the most competitions won by a male, at 6.\n\nDerrick Levasseur (born February 3, 1984), 30, is a police officer from Providence, Rhode Island Derrick applied for the show by sending an audition tape to casting. He is a super fan of the show. In Week 3, Derrick and Nicole won HoH, and Derrick nominated Caleb and Jocasta. He is a member of the \"Bomb Squad\" alliance, as well as being selected by fans for the secret Team America group along with Frankie and Donny. Derrick is a member of the Detonators alliance. Caleb and Jocasta lost the Battle of the Block competition and Derrick remained the sole HOH for the week. Donny won Power of Veto and removed Jocasta from the block. Derrick then made Devin the replacement nominee and Devin was evicted by a 11-0 vote. In Week 8, Derrick won his second HOH along with Frankie. Derrick nominated Donny and Christine, but Donny and Christine won the BOTB, dethroning Derrick as HOH. In Week 11, Derrick won his third HOH of the season during Double Eviction. He nominated Christine and Victoria for eviction and Christine was evicted. In Week 12, Derrick won his fourth (third sole) HOH of the season and he nominated Caleb and Victoria. Cody had won the POV and decided to not use it, with Cody evicting Caleb. Derrick is the first houseguest of the season to not be nominated 12 weeks into the game, this would be matched by his fellow Houseguest Nicole on Big Brother 18. Derrick got the news on July 25 of his grandfather's death, just two days after fellow HouseGuest and fellow Team America member Frankie received news that his grandfather died. On finale night, Derrick was crowned the winner of this season and won by a near unanimous 7-2 vote, receiving the votes of everyone on the jury except for Donny and Jocasta. He holds the record for most money won at $575,000.\n\nDevin Kenneth Shepherd (born September 9, 1987), 26, is a motorcycle sales manager now living in San Antonio, Texas. Originally from Oxnard, California, he was a minor league baseball player before retiring. He originally applied for The Amazing Race with an ex-girlfriend of his and was recruited for Big Brother. He entered the house with the first group. Devin initiated the \"Crazy 8's\" alliance with his group of the house (who entered first) and formed a side alliance with Donny known as the \"Double D's\". Following the second group's entrance into the house, Devin joined the \"Bomb Squad\" alliance and later targeted his own ally Donny for eviction. Without consulting the other alliance members, he then brought Amber and Christine into the \"Bomb Squad\". It then became clear to the other house guest that he was the loose cannon of his alliance, with his paranoia and erratic behavior starting to irritate the majority of his fellow house guests. He was crowned the second Head of Household in Week 2 after it was revealed that Cody had unintentionally fouled before he finished. He nominated Brittany and Paola, with the intention of evicting Brittany. Once he won the Power of Veto, Devin had a change of heart and did not want to evict a single mother of three as a single parent of a daughter himself. He ended up putting up his fellow \"Bomb Squad\" ally, Zach, as a replacement nominee which led to his alliance turning against him. Knowing everyone was out to get him, Devin fought to win the Power of Veto, however Donny beat him out in the second to last round of the competition (after which the rest of the HouseGuests cheered wildly). After Donny used the Power of Veto on Jocasta, Devin was announced the replacement nominee. Devin was the third house guest evicted on Day 28 in a unanimous vote. He came in 14th place.\nDevin is the birth son of actor Demond Wilson and Wendie Jo Sperber.\n\nDonald \"Donny\" Joseph Thompson (born November 7, 1971), 42, is a school groundskeeper from Albemarle, North Carolina. He entered the house with the first group. He was nominated by Caleb in the first week, which became official after he failed to win the \"Battle of the Block\" competition. On Day 6, Donny won the season's first POV competition, saving himself from potential eviction. He later became part of Team America. In week 3, Donny was nominated against Amber by Nicole after he told Jocasta and Brittany about Caleb's plans to throw the competition. Donny was named the replacement after Victoria vetoed herself by HOH Cody in Week 4. On Day 49, during a double eviction Donny was nominated beside Hayden. He won his 3rd power of veto and took himself off the block. In Week 7, Donny was nominated alongside Zach by HOH Christine. Donny and Zach lost the BOTB competition and remained on the block. After Zach won POV, Donny remained alongside replacement nominee Nicole. Donny survived eviction. In Week 8, Donny was nominated for a sixth time by HOH Derrick. However, Donny and Christine won the BOTB and dethroned Derrick. In Week 9, Donny was nominated for a seventh c time alongside Nicole by HOH Cody. Donny was evicted on Day 70 by a 5-0 vote. He is the fourth member of the Jury. He came in 8th place. On the finale night, he won America's Favorite Houseguest with $25,000. Donny voted for Cody to win Big Brother. On October 1, 2014 Thompson revealed his engagement to pre-season girlfriend Kristine Bartley \n\nFrank \"Frankie\" James Michael Grande Marchione (born January 24, 1983), 30, is a Broadway dancer, older half-brother of pop and R&B singer Ariana Grande, TV host and YouTube personality from New York, New York. He had previously applied to compete on \"Survivor\". Frankie applied to the show after getting encouragement from Adam Poch of BB13 to do so. He became the first Head of Household after winning the Head of Household competition, \"Go Fly a Kite\". However, he was dethroned as HoH after his nominees (Brittany and Victoria) won the \"Battle of the Block\" competition. He became co-Head of Household again in Week Four with partner Cody in the \"Devilled Eggs\" competition, but he was dethroned for the second time when nominees Amber and Jocasta won the Battle of the Block. He formed an alliance with his fellow HoH Caleb called the \"Bomb Squad\", as well as a final two deal with Zach. Frankie is also one of three members whom fans voted to participate in this season's twist, Team America. Frankie got the news of his grandfather's death on the show, but decided against leaving \"Big Brother\". Shortly thereafter, he won his third Head of Household competition, entitled \"Country Hits\", because Derrick threw the competition. Frankie is the first houseguest in Big Brother History to win HoH two weeks in a row. This is mostly because he was dethroned twice, giving him an equal chance to win HOH again. On Day 36, Frankie became the sole HoH (after being dethroned twice before) when his nominees (Jocasta and Victoria) lost the Battle of the Block competition. He was responsible for Amber's eviction that week. After Nicole won Head of Household, she and the rest of the house wanted to eliminate Frankie. She nominated Frankie and Caleb, and Caleb was going to throw the competition. However, Frankie won the competition by himself. In the next week, Frankie won his fourth Head of Household competition and nominated Cody and Caleb in an attempt to evict Donny. But after Christine and Donny won the Battle of the Block, and when Frankie won the Power of Veto competition, he decided to use the veto on Caleb and nominated his ally and best friend Zach in his place, in a successful attempt to finally evict Zach from the house. On Day 77, Frankie won his second POV of the season and won his fifth HOH competition of the season, meaning he has broken the record for most HOH wins but only retained three of his HOH reigns due to being dethroned Week 1 and 4 during the Double HOH Twist. Therefore, he did not break the record. In Week 12, Frankie was nominated alongside Victoria for eviction by Caleb and was evicted with a unanimous vote of 2-0, coming in 5th Place. Frankie voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. In terms of retainable competition wins, not including the Battle of the Block, Frankie Grande is tied with fellow houseguest Cody Calafiore, Frank Eudy and Shane Meaney for the most competitions won by a male, at 6.\n\nHayden Edward Voss (born June 8, 1993), 21, is a pedicab driver from Long Beach, California While at work, Hayden was recruited by casting to be on the show. He is also a vocalist for a metalcore band. He entered the house with the second group. Amber nominated Hayden and ally Nicole in Week 2, but they escaped the block after winning the Battle of the Block competition. Hayden and Nicole eventually developed a very close connection, which grew into a showmance. During the fifth week, Hayden won the Power of Veto and used it to save Victoria. On Day 49, Caleb immediately had to nominate two houseguests (It was Double Eviction Night) so, he nominated Hayden alongside Donny. In the POV Competition, Donny won the veto. He took himself off the block, and Caleb nominated Nicole in his spot. On Day 49, Hayden was evicted by a 5-2 vote. He is the second member of the Jury. He came in 10th place. Hayden voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. He was in a relationship with Nicole after the season ended.\n\nJocasta Brittain Odom (née Gates) (born August 10, 1980), 33, is a minister from Lovejoy, Georgia. She applied for the show. In Week 3, Derrick nominated Jocasta against Caleb. Since she was ill while the third PoV competition was being held, she could not compete. When Donny won the Power of Veto, he used it to remove Jocasta from the block. She was again nominated by Frankie against Amber, but won the Battle of the Block competition securing her safety for the week. In week 6, Jocasta was nominated alongside Zach by Nicole. However, Zach and Jocasta lost the Battle of the Block competition and remain on the block. On Day 49, Jocasta was evicted in a 6-2 vote. She is the first member of the Jury. She came in 11th place. Jocasta voted for Cody to win Big Brother.\n\nJoanna Marie \"Joey\" Van Pelt (born February 7, 1987), 27, is a hairstylist and make-up artist from Seattle, Washington. She described herself as being adventurous, happy, sensitive, and witty. She is further described as having \"very liberal views.\" Joey was recruited at her work to appear on the show. Upon entering the house, Joey became known for her short blue hair. She became the first member of the Team America alliance following a public vote that occurred prior to the season premiere. Joey became a part of the \"Crazy 8\" alliance and the \"El Quatro\" alliance soon after entering the house, though both alliances quickly fell apart. Joey later attempted to form a larger alliance with the girls in the house, but this plan failed. She later came clean to Devin about forming a girls' alliance to evict him, which upset several of the men in the house. On Day 10, Joey became the replacement nominee after Donny used the Power of Veto to save himself. Joey attempted to stay in the house by informing Hayden of the Team America twist, as well as dressing up in drag during a campaign to the HouseGuests. On Day 14, she became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of thirteen to zero. Following her appearance, Joey's gameplay was scrutinized by fans, with some describing her as \"the worst player in Big Brother history\". She came in 16th place.\n\nNicole Ann Franzel (born June 30, 1992), 21, was born and raised in Ubly, Michigan where she recently graduated college as a nurse. She was the second youngest contestant in the house. She applied for the show as a self-proclaimed 'super-fan.' She originally formed strong relationships with Christine and Hayden. Eventually, Hayden and Nicole developed a close connection that led some viewers to expect a showmance, and Nicole said Hayden would be a good boyfriend. She was nominated with Hayden by Amber in the second week, but those nominations were voided when she won the Battle of the Block with Hayden. In week 3, Nicole won HoH alongside Derrick and nominated Amber and Donny. After being dethroned from the HoH, she had to wear a frog costume for a week. Nicole was the first female houseguest this season to win HOH twice, and the first female sole HOH. On day 49 Nicole was a replacement nominee when Donny took himself off the block. She sat next to her showmance partner Hayden and witnessed his eviction. Immediately following she became next week HoH. During week 7, she was dethroned and then nominated. On day 56, she was evicted by a vote of 6-0. She is the third member of the jury, and the first person in Big Brother history to win HOH and get evicted in the same week. Nicole returned to the house Day 63 after she won the challenge between Hayden, Jocasta, and Zach. On Day 64, Nicole was nominated alongside Donny for eviction by HOH Cody. On Day 71, Nicole was nominated for a sixth consecutive time alongside Christine by HOH Caleb. Nicole was re-evicted by a vote of 4-0. She is the fifth member of the Jury. She came in 7th place. Nicole voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. After the season ended, she continued a romantic relationship with Hayden and stayed in touch with Victoria, Zach and Donny.\nNicole had a strong fanbase during the show, consistently being a fan favorite, which led to her being in the top 3 for America's Favorite House guest. Nicole later becomes a returnee contestant (along with James and Da'Vonne from Big Brother 17 and Frank from Big Brother 14) on Big Brother 18 where she was crowned the winner by a 5-4 vote.\n\nPaola Shea Racelis (born May 29, 1987), 27, is a DJ who is originally from East Hampton, Connecticut and is currently residing in Astoria, New York. She was recruited for the show, although she claims to have been a fan of the show. Paola has appeared in Maxim magazine as well as becoming a top ranked female gamer. She was in the first group to enter the house. Whilst in the house, Paola was seen as an easy target for nominations due to her complete lack of ability in all of the competitions. Caleb nominated Paola and Donny in week 1, however they lost the Battle of the Block and remained on the block. After Donny won the Power of Veto, Joey was announced as the replacement nominee. Paola survived the eviction, with no votes cast against her. In week 3, Devin nominated Paola alongside Brittany, with the latter being his main target. Devin asked Paola to throw the Battle of the Block and ensured her that she would not be going home. Paola kept her word and lost the Battle of the Block (although most of the HouseGuests weren't sure if she actually threw the competition due to being generally weak in all competitions). After Devin won the Power of Veto, he blindsided Paola by using the veto on Brittany after she made a valiant plea to him to keep her in the game, and announced Zach as the replacement nominee. On Day 21, Paola became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house, receiving a total of ten eviction votes, the first non-unanimous vote of the season, with only Jocasta and Donny voting to evict Zach. She came in 15th place.\n\nVictoria Rafaeli (born June 16, 1992), 21, is a photographer who is originally from Brooklyn and Holon, Israel but currently residing in Weston, Florida. She was raised by Orthodox Israeli parents and even once rejected a public marriage proposal. She has drawn comparisons to reality star Kim Kardashian. Victoria was inspired to become a photographer at the age of nine, ever since she picked up her first camera. She started her own photography business when she was only nineteen years old, without any formal training. Victoria was recruited for the show, although she claims she was unfamiliar with the American version, she had seen the Israeli version of the show.\n\nShe entered the house with the second group. She was nominated by Frankie for eviction, feeling like it was fair because she and Brittany were the first house guests to be eliminated in the HOH competition. However, they escaped the block after winning the \"Battle of the Block\" competition, voiding Frankie's nominations and removing his HoH status. On Day 29, she was nominated by Cody with once again Brittany and lost the \"Battle of the Block\" competition, but won the power of veto. She was again nominated by Frankie in the fifth week with Jocasta and failed to win the \"Battle of the Block\" competition, but was saved by Hayden, who she selected as \"Houseguests' Choice\" for the veto competition. During Week 6, she was nominated alongside Caleb by Donny for eviction, however, they won the \"Battle of the Block\" competition but in doing so earned three punishments; – shaved head, Adam and Eve (chained to Caleb for forty eight hours), and slop (for two weeks). During week 10, on Day 74, Victoria was the replacement nominee after Christine won the POV. On Day 77, Victoria was nominated by Derrick to ensure Christine's eviction. In Week 11, Frankie nominated Cody and Victoria with his target being later. Both got off the block however due to the Rewind Twist. During Week 12, Victoria was nominated for an eighth time alongside Frankie by Caleb, however Victoria won $5,000 when she bet on eventually winner Hayden to win the \"Puck It For Luxury\" Jury Competition. Victoria's closest ally has been Derrick, and she also formed a strong bond with Nicole when she returned to the house. Victoria currently holds the record for having the most nominations in a single season with ten nominations, but four of those nominations were either vetoed or canceled out through \"Battle of the Block\" wins. She does, however, hold a \"Big Brother\" record of most consecutive post-veto nominations, having survived all five of the other nominations each in a row, without receiving a single vote to evict her until her sixth consecutive nomination. On Day 97, Victoria was evicted by the final HOH Cody, coming in 3rd place. She is the ninth and final member of the Jury. Victoria voted for Derrick to win Big Brother.\n\nOn Aug 23, an incident involving Victoria started at around 11:14 a.m. when Nicole found Victoria collapsed in the toilet stall. It was believed that the pain she received from her wisdom teeth (which started on Aug 22) was a possible cause. Victoria left the house for medical attention and she returned to the house at 1:56 p.m. from the hospital. She stated that they gave her an IV for the pain and dehydration.\n\nZachary \"Zach\" Colin Rance (born September 9, 1990), 23, is from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Economics. Zach was a member of the \"Bomb Squad\" and the founder of \"The Detonators\". Zach won his first HOH in week 5 and choose to nominate Nicole and his ally, Christine after she refuses to follow through with his plan to throw the Battle of the Block competition with Amber, his real target. He was ultimately dethroned. He was nominated in Week 6 by Nicole but escaped the eviction after his ally voted for him to stay. He was nominated once again in Week 7 by his ally Christine. He won the veto and saved himself, leading to Nicole's eviction. In Week 8, he became the replacement nominee by Frankie after he was deemed a troublemaker by him and was evicted on a 5-0 vote. He is technically the fourth jury member but Nicole came back so it makes him the third member of the Jury. He came in 9th place. Zach voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. Zach became quite popular with fans for his zany behavior and seemingly romantic relationship with House Guest Frankie Grande which led him to be in the Top 3 of America's Favourite Houseguest.\n"}

He ruled over an area of southern Xinjiang, nicknamed Tunganistan by westerners, from 1934-37.\n\nMa Hushan fought against the Russian Red Army and White Russian forces during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang and defeated them in battle. \"The Russ brought the fiji and bombed and gassed us\" - said by Ma Hsi Jung (Ma Hushan) on the war.\n\nHe also took part in the war to destroy the First East Turkestan Republic, commanding the 36th division at the Battle of Kashgar and Battle of Khotan.\n\nHis 36th Division crushed the Charkhlik Revolt by the Uighurs in the Charkhlik oasis. It controlled southern Xinjiang's oasis and the area was nicknamed \"Tunganistan\" by Peter Fleming. Ma Hushan and the 36th Division declared their loyalty to the Kuomintang government in Nanjing and sent emissaries there requesting aid to fight against Sheng Shicai's provincial forces and the Soviet Union.\n\nKhotan was the base of Ma Hushan during his rule over the southern oases. His troops were said to be \"strongly anti-Japanese\", and the territory they ruled was covered with \"most of the stock anti-Japanese slogans from China proper,\" and Ma made \"Resistance to Japanese Imperialism\" part of his governing doctrine. Ma Hushan himself was described by Ella Maillart as a \"well-set-up long-legged man\".\n\nHis regime forced the switch from the old style to the manufacture of Chinese-style carpets by the government-owned factory. He ordered the creation of \"small blue carpets\", \"woven in Khotan\". They were of Chinese design, with Chinese writing on them. Peter Birchler mistakenly said that Ma Hushan's brother-in-law Ma Zhongying was the client of the carpet factory.\n\nMa Hushan formulated a plan for an anti-Soviet \"jihad\" to conquer the Kremlin, Russian Turkestan and Siberia. He promised a devastated Europe and the conquering of Russia and India. The anti-Soviet client uprising by Ma Hsi Jung (Ma Ho San) was reported by United Press International (UPI) and read by Ahmad Kamal on 3 June, 1937.\n\nMa's troops were defeated by Sheng Shicai and the Soviets, and many of them deserted or defected. Ma fled to British India. He brought with him thousands of ounces of gold, which was confiscated by the British. The British kept that money to pay for the alleged \"looting\" of British property in Kashgar by Ma's troops, but eventually sent the money \"back\" to Sheng Shicai's regime. He was briefly detained by the British, then took a steamer from Calcutta back to China--specifically Qinghai province--in 1938.\n\nBritish telegrams from India in 1937 said that Tungans like Ma Zhongying and Ma Hushan had reached an agreement with the Soviets, whom they had previously fought, that since the Japanese had begun full-scale warfare with China, that Tungans led by Ma Hushan would help Chinese forces battle Japan, and that he would return to Gansu.\n\nSven Hedin wrote that Ma Hushan would \"certainly obey the summons\" to join the Chinese side against Japan in the war.\n\nMa led the Kuomintang Islamic insurgency in China from 1950 to 1958 against the PLA from 1950–54 using guerrilla tactics. He was captured in 1954 and executed at Lanzhou.\n\n"}

In the 1950s and '60s she led a family life, marrying twice and raising three children. During this time, she read the influential feminist works \"The Second Sex\" by Simone de Beauvoir and \"The Feminine Mystique\" by Betty Friedan, and resolved to complete her degree. She re-entered at the University of Redlands and earned a bachelor's in history in 1965. She became a high school teacher, but felt that her intellectual needs remained unsatisfied, and in 1970, despite financial insecurity due to a recent divorce, entered the doctoral program in history at the University of California, Riverside. She had retained an interest in feminism and women's history, influenced by \"Time\"'s 1970 cover story on Kate Millett and a meeting of the National Organization for Women, and resolved that her dissertation topic be related to these interests. She received her Ph.D in 1975.\n\nAs a graduate student, she taught \"Women in History\" at San Bernardino Valley College, which she later characterized as her first \"women's studies\" course. She was hired at San Diego State University in 1974 and appointed chair of the women's studies program, which had been founded in 1970.

He studied business administration and trained in the grocery industry before moving to Nelson.\n\nCourtney represented the Nelson electorate from 1976 to 1981 and was opposition spokesman for horticulture and fisheries for five years. He was a recipient of both the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 for service to the community and the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal in recognition of services to New Zealand. Courtney is currently in his fourth term on the Nelson City Council.\n\nIn March 1981 Courtney announced that he had let his membership of the Labour Party lapse. Soon after, he withdrew from the Labour Party caucus and sat in the New Zealand House of Representatives as an independent.\n\nThe Labour Party suffered defeats in the 1975, 1978 and 1981 general elections under the leadership of Bill Rowling. Courtney saw the momentum that had been gained under the Prime Ministership of the charismatic Labour leader Norman Kirk (1972–74) was being eroded and lost by Rowling. Courtney firmly believed that change was needed in the leadership in order to beat Robert Muldoon and the National Party. Rowling was not an effective counter to Muldoon: in Parliament Muldoon had the measure of Rowling and Rowling was perceived as weak in the media. After Courtney's strong performance in the Nelson by-election in 1976 the 1978 Labour Party general election result was a \"major disappointment\" for Courtney (Henderson, 1981). In the December 1980 leadership vote of confidence Courtney voted against Rowling. Rowling clung onto the Labour leadership by one vote-his own (Bassett, 2008).\n\nCourtney's announcement of his independent candidacy for the 1981 general election was made only a few days before the 35th anniversary of the death of Harry Atmore, MP for Nelson from 1911 to 1946. Atmore had been the last independent MP to be elected to the Parliament of New Zealand.\n\nAt the 1981 election supporters rallied around Courtney's Independent campaign and, although defeated, it was by the very narrow margin of 698 votes. Courtney took 37.0 per cent of the total vote, 3.4 percentage points behind the Labour candidate, and nearly three times as many votes as the National candidate's share of the vote. This was the best result by an independent candidate in New Zealand Elections in nearly 40 years.\nCourtney was an elected member of Nelson City Council for six years during the 1970s under Mayor Roy McLennan; for some of that time, he was also a Member of Parliament. He had a three-year gap and then became a member of the city council for another three-year term under Mayor Peter Malone.\n\nCourtney came out of political retirement for the 2016 local elections. Of the 12 successful candidates, Courtney was elected with 6,743 votes.\n\nCourtney owned and operated supermarkets in Nelson and at its peak, he had five of them. He retired to Australia in about 2000. He returned to live in Nelson in late 2014 or early 2015.\n\nCourtney was the Vice Chair of Norm Kirk's Campaign Committee for the Sydenham Electorate in 1969.\nMel Courtney's grandfather, H.F. Courtney, was an engine driver on the Nelson Railway from 1915 to 1920 and lived at Glenhope.\nSee Voller, Lois (1991) Rails to Nowhere: The History of the Nelson Railway, Nelson: Nikau Press.\nCourtney was a member of the Cawthron Institute Trust Board from 1976 to 1981.\nCourtney was a member of the first New Zealand Parliamentary delegation to China in 1977.\nCourtney attended the 21st Anniversary of Scott Base in 1978 representing the New Zealand Parliament\nFor contemporaneous events in Britain between January and June 1981 and the Council for Social Democracy\n\n\n\n"}

The term was initially used for a Vlach pastoralist community in the mountains of Croatia in the second half of the 14th until the early 16th century. Later, when the community straddled the Venetian–Ottoman border in the 17th century, it referred to Slavic-speaking, mainly Eastern Orthodox, and to a lesser degree Roman Catholic people. The exonym ceased to be used in an ethnic sense by the end of the 18th century, and came to be viewed as derogatory, but has been renewed as a social or cultural anthropological subject. With the nation-building in the 19th century, the population of the Dalmatian Hinterland espoused either a Serb or Croat ethnic identity, but preserved some common sociocultural outlines.\n\nThe word \"Morlach\" is derived from Italian \"Morlacco\" and Latin \"Morlachus\" or \"Murlachus\", being cognate to Greek Μαυροβλάχοι \"Maurovlachoi\", meaning \"Black Vlachs\" (from Greek μαύρο \"mauro\" meaning \"dark\", \"black\"). The Serbo-Croatian term in its singular form is '; its plural form is ' [mor-latsi]. In some 16th-century redactions of the \"Doclean Chronicle\", they are referred to as \"Morlachs or \"Nigri Latini\"\" (Black Latins). Petar Skok suggested it derived from the Latin \"maurus\" and Greek \"maurós\" (\"dark\"), the diphthongs \"au\" and \"av\" indicating a Dalmato-Romanian lexical remnant. \n\nDimitrie Cantemir, in his \"History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire\" remarks that when Moldavia was subdued to the Ottoman Rule by Bogdan III, Moldavia was referred to by the Ottomans as \"Ak iflac\", or Ak Vlach (i.e., White Wallachians), while the Wallachians were known as \"Kara iflac\", or Kara Vlach, (i.e., Black Wallachians). \n\"Black Vlachs\" in fact mean \"Northern Vlachs\" , because Turkish \"kara\" means black but also means North in old Turkish.\n\nThere are several interpretations of the ethnonym and phrase \"moro/mavro/mauro vlasi\". The direct translation of the name Morovlasi in Serbo-Croatian would mean Black Vlachs. It was considered that \"black\" referred to their clothes of brown cloth. The 17th-century Venetian Dalmatian historian Johannes Lucius suggested that it actually meant \"Black Latins\", compared to \"White Romans\" in coastal areas. The 18th-century writer Alberto Fortis in his book \"Travels in Dalmatia\" (1774), in which he wrote extensively about the Morlachs, thought that it derived from the Slavic \"more\" (\"sea\") – \"morski Vlasi\" meaning \"Sea Vlachs\". 18th-century writer Ivan Lovrić, observing Fortis' work, thought that it came from \"more\" (sea) and \"(v)lac(s)i\" (strong) (\"strongmen by the sea\"), and mentioned how the Greeks called Upper Vlachia \"Maurovlachia\" and that the Morlachs would have brought that name with them. Cicerone Poghirc and Ela Cosma offer a similar interpretation that it meant \"Northern Latins\", derived from the Indo-European practice of indicating cardinal directions by colors. Other theories suggest that it refers to their camps and pastures which were built in \"dark\" places, that it was a demonym derived from the Morava river region, or from the Morea peninsula, or, according to Dominik Mandić, from African Maurs.\n\nThe etymology of the exonym points to a connection with Vlachs, but as stated in Fortis' work \"Travels in Dalmatia\", they were at that time Slavic-speaking. Because of migrations from various parts of the Balkans, the name had passed to later communities. The Morlach people were both of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic faith.\n\nFortis spotted the physical difference between Morlachs; those from around Kotor, Sinj and Knin were generally blond-haired, with blue eyes, and broad faces, while those around Zadvarje and Vrgorac were generally brown-haired with narrow faces. They also differed in nature. Although they were often seen by urban dwellers as strangers and \"those people\" from the periphery, in 1730 \"provveditore\" Zorzi Grimani described them as \"ferocious, but not indomitable\" by nature, Edward Gibbon called them \"barbarians\", and Fortis praised their \"noble savagery\", moral, family, and friendship virtues, but also complained about their persistence in keeping to old traditions. He found that they sang melancholic verses of epic poetry related to the Ottoman occupation, accompanied with the traditional single stringed instrument called gusle. During his travels, he discovered what he believed to be a \"Morlachian ballad\", the \"Hasanaginica\". Manfred Beller and Joep Leerssen identified the cultural traits of the Morlachs as being part of the South Slavic and Serb ethnotype.\n\nThey made their living as shepherds and merchants, as well as soldiers. They neglected agricultural work, usually did not have gardens and orchards besides those growing naturally, and had for the time old farming tools, Lovrić explaining it as: \"what our ancestors did not do, neither will we\". Morlach families had herds numbering from 200 to 600, while the poorer families around 40 to 50, from which they received milk, and made various dairy products.\n\nContemporary I. Lovrić said that the Morlachs were Slavs who spoke better Slavic than the Ragusans (owing to the growing Italianization of the Dalmatian coast). Boško Desnica (1886–1945), after analysing Venetian papers, concluded that the Venetians undifferentiated the Slavic people in Dalmatia, and that the language and script of the region was labeled as \"Illirico\" or \"Servian\". Lovrić made no distinction between the Vlachs/Morlachs and the Dalmatians and Montenegrins, whom he considered Slavs, and was not at all bothered by the fact that the Morlachs were predominantly Orthodox Christian. Fortis noted that there was often conflict between the Catholic and Orthodox Morlachs.\nHowever some of Morlachs have passed to Islam during Turkish occupation\n\nIn his book, \"Viaggio in Dalmatia\", Fortis presented the poetry of the Morlachs. He also published several specimens of Morlach songs. Fortis believed that the Morlachs preserved their old customs and clothes. Their ethnographic traits were traditional clothings, use of the gusle musical instrument accompanied with epic singing.\n\nThe use of \"Morlachs\" is first attested in 1344, when \"Morolacorum\" are mentioned in lands around Knin and Krbava during the conflict between the counts of the Kurjaković and Nelipić families. The first mention of the term \"Morlachs\" is simultaneous with the appearance of Vlachs in the documents of Croatia in the early 14th century; in 1321, a local priest on the island of Krk granted land to the church (\"to the lands of Kneže, which are called Vlach\"), while in 1322 Vlachs were allied with Mladen Šubić at the battle in the hinterland of Trogir. According to Mužić in those early documents there is no identifiable differentiation between the terms Vlach and Morlach. In 1352, in the agreement in which Zadar sold salt to the Republic of Venice, Zadar retained part of the salt that \"Morlachi\" and others exported by land. In 1362, the \"Morlachorum\", settled, without authorization, on lands of Trogir and used it for pasture for a few months. In the Statute of Senj dating to 1388, the Frankopans mentioned \"Morowlachi\" and defined the amount of time they had for pasture when they descended from the mountains. In 1412, the \"Murlachos\" captured the Ostrovica Fortress from Venice. In August 1417, Venetian authorities were concerned with the \"Morlachs and other Slavs\" from the hinterland, who were a threat to security in Šibenik.\n\nEarly Vlachs probably lived on Croatian territory even before the 14th century, being the progeny of romanized Illyrians and pre-Slavic Romance-speaking people. During the 14th century, Vlach settlements existed throughout much of today's Croatia, from the northern island Krk, around the Velebit and Dinara mountains, and along the southern rivers Krka and Cetina. Those Vlachs had, by the end of the 14th and 15th century, lost, if they ever spoke, their Romance language, or were at least bilingual. As they adopted Slavic language, the only characteristic \"Vlach\" element was their pastoralism. The so-called Istro-Romanians continued to speak their Romance language on the island of Krk and villages around Lake Čepić in Istria, while other communities in the mountains above the lake preserved the Shtokavian-Chakavian dialect with Ikavian accent from the southern Velebit and area of Zadar.\n\nThe Istro-Romanians, and other Vlachs (or Morlachs), had settled Istria (and mountain Ćićarija) after the various devastating outbreaks of the plague and wars between 1400 and 1600, reaching the island of Krk. In 1465 and 1468, there are mentions of \"Morlach\" judge Gerg Bodolić and \"Vlach\" peasant Mikul, in Krk and Crikvenica, respectively. The Venetian colonization of Istria (and Ćićarija) occurred not later than the early 1520s, and there were several cases when \"Vlachs\" returned to Dalmatia.\n\nAs many former inhabitants of the Croatian-Ottoman borderland fled northwards or were captured by the Ottoman invaders, they left unpopulated areas. The Austrian Empire established the Military Frontiers in 1522, which served as a buffer against Ottoman incursions. At the time, \"Vlachs\", served both in the conquesting Ottoman armies, and Austria and Venice, and were settled by both sides.\n\nIn 1579, several groups of \"Morlachs\", understood as a Serb tribe in Dalmatia, immigrated and requested to be employed as military colonists. Initially, there were some tensions between these immigrants and the established Uskoks. In 1593, \"provveditore generale\" (Overseer) Cristoforo Valier mentioned three nations constituting the Uskoks: the \"natives of Senj, Croatians, and Morlachs from the Turkish parts\".\n\nThe name \"Morlach\" entered toponymy; the Velebit mountain was called \"Montagne della Morlacca\" (\"mountain of the Morlachs\"), while the Velebit canal was called \"Canale della Morlacca\".\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, the historical term changes meaning, as in most Venetian documents, Morlachs are now usually called immigrants, both Orthodox and Catholic, from the Ottoman-conquered territories in the Western Balkans (chiefly Bosnia and Herzegovina). These settled in the Venetian-Ottoman frontier, in the hinterlands of coastal cities, and entered Venetian military service by the early 17th century.\n\nAt the time of the Cretan War (1645–69) and Morean War (1684-99), a large number of \"Morlachs\" settled inland of the Dalmatian towns, and Ravni Kotari of Zadar. They were skilled in warfare and familiar with local territory, and served as paid soldiers in both Venetian and Ottoman armies. Their activity was similar to that of the Uskoks. Their military service granted them land, and freed them from trials, and gave them rights which freed them from full debt law (only 1/10 yield), thus many joined the so-called \"Morlach\" or \"Vlach\" armies.\n\nAt the time, some notable Morlach military leaders who were also enumerated in epic poetry, were: Janko Mitrović, Ilija and Stojan Janković, Petar, Ilija and Franjo Smiljanić, Stjepan and Marko Sorić, Vuk Mandušić, Ilija Perajica, Šimun Bortulačić, Božo Milković, Stanislav Sočivica, and Counts Franjo and Juraj Posedarski. Divided by religion, the Mitrović-Janković family were the leaders of Orthodox Morlachs, while the Smiljanić family were leaders of Catholic Morlachs.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Republic of Venice in 1797, and loss of power in Dalmatia, the term Morlach would disappear from use.\n\nDuring the time of Enlightenment and Romanticism, Morlachs were seen as the \"model of primitive Slavdom\", and the \"spirits of pastoral Arcadia \"Morlacchia\"\". They attracted the attention of travel writers like 17th-century Jacob Spon and Sir George Wheler, and 18th-century writers Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who labeled their poems as \"Morlackisch\". In 1793, at the carnival in Venice, a play about Morlacchi, \"Gli Antichi Slavi\" (\"antique Slavs\"), was performed, and in 1802 it was reconceived as a ballet \"Le Nozze dei Morlacchi\". At the beginning of the 19th century, still seen as relics from the primitive past and a byword for barbarous people, they inspired science fiction novelist H. G. Wells in his depiction of the fictional Morlocks , while the female embroidered leggings reminded Thomas Graham Jackson of the appearance of American Indian squaws. In the 20th century, Alice Moque, as did many other women travelers, in her 1914 travelogue \"Delightful Dalmatia\" emphasized the picturesqueness of the sight of Morlach women and men in their folk costumes, which \"made Zara's Plazza look like a stage setting\", and regretted the coming of new civilization.\n\nIn the Balkans the term became derogatory, indicating people from the mountains – backward people, and became disliked by the \"Morlachs\" (Croats and Serbs) themselves. There have been no individuals declaring themselves to be Morlachs in the Croatian censuses.\n\nItalian cheese Morlacco, also named as Morlak, Morlach, Burlach, or Burlacco, was named after Morlach herders and woodsmen who lived and made it in the region of Monte Grappa. \"Morlacchi\" remains attested as an Italian family name.\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to entering politics, McCaleb was a practicing civil engineer.\n\nMcCaleb was elected as a Republican to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1974. He remained in the House until 1983. In 1978, McCaleb's colleagues elected him House Minority Leader. He remained in that position until his retirement from the Legislature.\n\nGovernor of Oklahoma Henry Bellmon appointed McCaleb to serve as the State's first Secretary of Transportation. The post was created following the passage of the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986. In addition to his service as Secretary, Bellmon appointed him to serve concurrently as Director of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. McCaleb served in both positions until the end of Bellmon's term in 1991.\n\nFollowing the end of Bellmon's term, McCaleb became the President of the Oklahoma Good Roads and Transportation Association, a lobbying group dedicated to advocating safe, efficient and affordable state streets, roads and highways.

She has been leading the legal fight against terror financing, the anti-Israel boycott campaigns (BDS) and combating the multitude of lawfare tactics utilized against the Jewish State by its enemies. As the president of the Israel-based civil rights organization, Shurat HaDin–Israel Law Center, she has represented hundreds of terror victims in legal actions against terror organizations and their supporters. Ms. Darshan-Leitner has successfully recovered more than two hundred million dollars in compensation on their behalf. In recent years, Ms. Darshan-Leitner initiated a legal campaign to deprive terrorists of social media resources such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which they use to incite violence against Jews and promote terror attacks. In her efforts to combat anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli activities, Ms. Darshan-Leitner assisted in blocking the Gaza Flotilla, terminated efforts to indict IDF soldiers for war crimes, and filed legal actions against those who boycott Israeli academics and companies in violation of the law.\n\nStaffed by some of Israel's leading activist attorneys, Shurat HaDin–Israel Law Center follows the model of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the famed American civil rights organization dedicated to bankrupting the KKK and other neo-Nazi groups in the United States with the goal to economically destroy the hate groups in the Middle East. Thus, the organization's motto: \"Bankrupting Terrorism – One Lawsuit at a Time!\" She and her associates specialize in tracking the assets and bank accounts of terror groups and legally obstructing and restraining their funds. They have become known by banks, legal organizations and outlaw regimes around the world as the leading authority and resource on stopping the movement of global terror financing. Today, they represent hundreds of terror victims in lawsuits against Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the PLO, The Palestinian Authority, Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Egypt, North Korea, UBS, and the Lebanese Canadian Bank. The cases, being litigated in Israeli, American, Canadian and European courts, allow the victims of terrorism to fight back.\n\nIn 2016, Ms. Darshan-Leitner was chosen as one of the 50 most influential Jews in the world by the Jerusalem Post, and named by the Israeli Forbes magazine as one of the 50 most influential Israeli women.\n\nDarshan-Leitner was born in Petah Tikva, Israel. After completing undergraduate education she received a law degree from Bar Ilan University in the 1990s and holds an MBA from Manchester University. She subsequently received an MBA from Manchester University in the United Kingdom. She is a mother of six children and is married to Aviel Leitner, an American-born law lecturer from Miami, Florida. She currently lives in North Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nIn the 1990s Darshan-Leitner helped litigate a case on behalf of victims of the Achille Lauro hijacking of 1985. During work on this case, she appeared before the Israeli Supreme Court in an attempt to prevent one of the hijackers, Muhammed Abbas from being allowed to travel to Israel. On April 15, 2003, Abbas was captured by American forces in Iraq while attempting to flee from Baghdad to Syria. Italy subsequently requested his extradition. The Pentagon reported on March 9, 2004 that Zaidan had died the previous day, of natural causes, while in U.S. custody.\n\nIn 2003, Darshan-Leitner founded Shurat HaDin – Israel Law Center in Tel Aviv. Shurat HaDin is an Israeli-based civil rights center which focuses on bringing lawsuits and legal actions on behalf of the victims of terrorism. She has said she was influenced by the activities of the Southern Poverty Law Center which had bankrupted several branches of the KKK and other neo-Nazi groups through civil litigation. In founding Shurat HaDin, she noted her goal was to \"go after terrorists in the same way that they (the SPLC) were going after racists.\"\n\nAccording to a 2007 US embassy cable released by WikiLeaks, Darshan-Leitner explained to a US embassy official that Shurat HaDin received evidence from and had taken direction \"on which cases to pursue\" from Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency.\n\nDarshan-Leitner is said to have succeeded in receiving more than $1 billion in judgments, freezing over $600 million in terror assets and securing over $120 million in actual disbursements to the victims and their families. She represents hundreds of terror victims in cases brought against Jimmy Carter, the Islamic Republic of Iran, North Korea, the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and the PLO, among others. She successfully represented Puerto Rican family victims of the 1972 Lod terrorist attack in a lawsuit against North Korea. In 2010, a US federal court on the island ruled in their favor, ordering the North Korean government to compensate the victims for the sum of $378 million.\n\nSince 2003 Darshan-Leitner and a team of lawyers have worked with hundreds of terror victims in lawsuits and legal actions against Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, Iran, Syria, Islamic Jihad and numerous financial institutions.\n\nDarshan-Leitner has been involved in a wide range of legal actions in Israel. and abroad on behalf of Jewish rights cases\n\nIn 2012, Darshan-Leitner (Shurat Hadin) sent warning letters to World Vision Australia and AusAID, after the two aid organisations had been accused of funding the Palestinian Union of Agricultural Workers Committee (UAWC) which Darshan-Leitner said was an instrumentality of the terrorist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). UAWC - World Vision activities were resumed in early March 2012 after an investigation by World Vision found no evidence that humanitarian support for UAWC was in any way leaking to terrorists. Darshan-Leitner rejected the finding and demanded, under Australia's Freedom of Information Act that AUS Aid and World Vision turn over details of the investigation. She noted that USAID, the agency that administers foreign aid for the U.S. government, has labeled UAWC a PFLP affiliate, an allegation based on a 1993 report. Darshan-Leitner also alleged that the President, Vice-President, Treasurer and other key members of the AUWC board are senior PFLP officials. On April 2, 2012, the Shurat HaDin Center was asked by the Australian Government to provide it with evidence of a connection between the AUWC and the PFLP.\n\nIn September 2006 Darshan-Leitner and New York City attorney Robert Tolchin filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the families of 12 missing Jewish-Iranians against the former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Khatami has refused to answer the complaint and has defaulted the case.\n\nIn January 2008 she filed a lawsuit for NIS 260,000,000 ($65,000,000 US) against the Egyptian Government in a court in Beersheba on behalf of ten families of Sderot (Israel) whose relatives were killed or seriously injured by Palestinian Kassam rockets.\n\nThirty families who were victims of terrorist attacks either because they were injured or because they lost a family member in a wave of terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel between 2001 and 2003. The families sued Credit Lyonnais, a French bank, because the bank provided banking services and maintained accounts for CBSP, a primary fundraiser for Hamas (as designated by the US Treasury Department and by Israel in 1998). CBSP acts in collaboration with more than a dozen humanitarian organizations based in different towns in the West Bank and Gaza and in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. The group has collected large amounts of money from mosques and Islamic centers, which it then transfers to sub-organizations of Hamas.\n\nFrom 1997 onward, the bank allegedly knowingly transferred large sums to Hamas controlled organizations in the West Bank and Gaza. This activity occurred until 2003, when the bank finally closed the account following over three years of suspicious fund transfers.\n\nIn March 2008 the court denied defendant's motion, noting in particular that France maintains a particularly strong interest in eradicating terrorism, and the likelihood of criminal or civil challenges against the bank are rather slim.\n\nIn May 2008 Shurat HaDin was co-counsel in filing in Manhattan Federal Court against Swiss mega bank UBS GA which is accused by the plaintiffs of financing terror. Included amongst the plaintiffs were three families who were physically and emotionally harmed by the Katyusha rockets launched by Hizbollah into Israeli cities during the 2006 war with Lebanon. Attorneys for UBS have denied the allegations and said they would vigorously defend the lawsuit.\n\nThe Federal District Court dismissed the complaint in August 2009 for lack of proximate cause between UBS’ fund transfers and Iranian support of terror organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. The court found that there was no causal link between UBS and the terror organizations supported by Iran. The court stated that a requirement under the Anti-terrorism Act is that UBS not only must have known about the causal link between its funds provided to Iran and Iranian support for terror organizations, but also must have intended that the funds were to be used for that purpose. Such intent was not proven by plaintiffs.\n\nIn June 2008 the families of 12 missing Iranian Jews filed a petition in the Israeli High Court of Justice seeking to block the Israeli government from releasing information on the fate of four disappeared Iranian diplomats as part of the prisoner release deal with Hizbollah. The Iranian diplomats were captured by Christian militia forces, the Samir Jaja faction, in South Lebanon in 1982. The families are represented in the court proceeding before the High Court by Darshan-Leitner.\n\nIn July 2008 Darshan-Leiter received word from the Israeli High Court of Justice that the petition was being dismissed as the issue was one of \"diplomatic concern.\" The court did however point a harsh finger at Israeli PM at the time, Mr. Ehud Olmert, with an expectation that the \"matter not be pushed asunder.\" Darshan-Leinter then turned to the PM with a request by the families for an urgent meeting before the deal went through. Receiving no response, Darshan-Leiter then turned to all 120 members of the Israeli Parliament, The Knesset, asking that they remember the 12 Missing Jews of Iran in their speeches and activities throughout their term of service.\n\nIn July 2008 the Center joined with Montreal-based attorney Jeffrey Boro and Professor Ed Morgan of the University of Toronto's International Law and Counter-Terrorism Project to file a civil action by Canadian victims of Hizbollah. The lawsuit. contends that since 2004, the Lebanese-Canadian Bank (LCB), formerly the Lebanese branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, permitted the Yousser Company for Finance and Investment and the Martyrs Foundation, two Lebanese organizations recognized by the United States as active terrorist groups, to open and maintain accounts at the bank. The suit alleges that LCB allowed the two groups to freely transfer many millions of dollars of Hizbollah funds and to carry out millions of dollars in financial transactions, within and without Lebanon, by means of wire transfers, letters of credit, checks and credit cards provided by LCB. LCB, the suit charged, facilitated Hizbollah's terrorist activities and is liable to the plaintiffs for the harm that has been inflicted upon them and their families in the rockets attacks launched by Hizbollah on civilians in Northern Israel in the year 2006. Darshan-Leitner claimed in filing the suit that LCB knew that both charities are part of Hizbollah's financial arm and that by providing them banking services they were really assisting the Iranian backed terrorists in Lebanon and their rocket attacks against civilians.\n\nOn July 14, 2008 Darshan-Leiter and Attorney Robert Tolchin of New York filed a civil action on behalf of victims of the Hizbollah against an American Bank. The action was filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan Representing 85 victims and their family members, the lawsuit alleges that the American Express (AMEX) Bank, Ltd. and the Lebanese-Canadian Bank (LCB) unlawfully executed millions of dollars in wire transfers for Hizbollah between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs assert that Hizbollah used the funds transferred by AMEX Bank and LCB to prepare and carry out the rocket attacks which the terrorist organization rained on Israeli cities between July 12 and August 14, 2006.\n\nThe plaintiffs rested their claims in part on written findings issued by the New York State Banking Department in 2007, which determined that AMEX Bank had failed to establish adequate procedures to prevent terrorism financing as demanded by state and federal law. This is the first lawsuit brought by terror victims against a U.S. financial institution that serves as a correspondent for a bank in Lebanon. Darshan-Leitner told the Associated Press that \"the idea of the lawsuit in part is to warn American correspondent banks that they will be held responsible for attacks by Hezbollah if they transfer money to them,\" Darshan-Leitner said. \"We expect them to follow the law.\"\n\nOn August 21, 2008 over 100 victims of terrorist attacks carried out by the Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad (\"PIJ\") terror organizations in Israel filed a civil action in Los Angeles Superior Court against China's largest bank, the Bank of China Ltd. (\"BOC\"). The suit, Zahavi v. Bank of China, seeks both compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that starting in 2003, BOC executed dozens of wire transfers for the Hamas and PIJ totaling several million dollars. In April 2005, Israeli counter-terrorism officers met with officials from the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and China's Central Bank regarding these Hamas and PIJ wire transfers. The Israelis demanded that the Chinese officials take action to prevent BOC from making any further such transfers. Despite the Israeli warnings, the BOC – with the Chinese government's approval – continued to wire terrorist funds for the Hamas and PIJ. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Federico C. Sayre of Los Angeles, Robert Tolchin of New York City and Darshan-Leitner.\n\nIn February 2011 Darshan-Leitner and David Schoen filed a $5m lawsuit against former US President Jimmy Carter, alleging that his book \"intentionally misleads and misrepresents about actual historic events\", contrary to New York state law against deceptive business practices. In May 2011, three months after the filing, the suit was dropped by the plaintiffs.\n\nIn June 2014, Darshan-Leitner filed a writ in the United States District Court in Washington, DC, seeking seizure of the web domains belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran to compensate victims of Iranian sponsored terrorism. The awarding of this seizure and the assets to the plaintiffs of a 2003 lawsuit where they won a monetary award, but have been unable to collect. This suit,filed against Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), seeks the seizure based on ICANN's position as a United States registered non-profit organization. The debate on whether ICANN should be under the jurisdiction of the U.S. has been going on for some time, and has not been resolved.\n\nIn September 2014, Shurat HaDin filed a war crimes complaint against Khaled Mashaal, the top leader of Hamas at the International Criminal Court for executing Palestinians without trial during the Summer 2014 Gaza war.\n\nSokolow et al v. Palestine Liberation Organization et al - Darshan-Leitner was co-counsel in the civil proceedings against the PLO and the Palestinian Authority, which found both organizations liable for the injuries and deaths of American citizens caused by six terror attacks in Israel between 2001 and 2004. Damages totaling $655.5 million were awarded by the jury.\n\nOn May 1, 2008, Darshan-Leitner along with former Soviet Ida Nudel launched a public campaign to save the life of a Palestinian police officer accused of having assisted the Israeli intelligence services in hunting down fugitive terrorists. The policeman, Imad Sa'ad has been sentenced to death by a Palestinian military tribunal in Hebron. Sa'ad, it is alleged, provided the Israel Defense Forces with the whereabouts of four suspected bomb makers whom the Palestinian Authority was unwilling to hand over to the Israelis.\n\nDarshan-Leitner has argued that the Temple Mount is being harmed by work carried out by the Jerusalem Wakf and she organized a campaign to encourage the Israeli government to file charges against the Wakf. \"The Temple Mount\", one of the holiest sites in the Muslim world and home of the Al-Aqsa mosque, \"is the property of Jewish nation and has been for thousands of years,\" claimed Darshan-Leitner.

{"id": "33786758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33786758", "title": "Plankton and Karen", "text": "Plankton and Karen\n\nSheldon J. Plankton and Karen Plankton are fictional characters in the American animated television series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". They are respectively voiced by Mr. Lawrence and Jill Talley. Their first appearance was in the episode \"Plankton!\" that premiered on July 31, 1999. They were created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg, the creator of the program, with additional character development by Lawrence.\n\nPlankton is an intellectual planktonic copepod who runs the unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant alongside Karen, who is a talking supercomputer. Plankton is the arch-rival of Mr. Krabs, who owns the far more profitable Krusty Krab restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the Krabby Patty. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.\n\nCritical reception for Plankton and Karen has been positive, with praise directed toward their voices and dialogue together. They began as minor characters, but Lawrence developed their personalities throughout the show's early seasons and they eventually became the franchise's main antagonists. The Planktons play central roles in the 2004 theatrical film, which promoted them both to main cast members in its credits, and the . They have also been featured in a variety of spin-off media, including tie-in publications, playsets and other merchandise.\n\nPlankton is the nemesis and the former best friend of Mr. Krabs. He operates the Chum Bucket, located directly across the street from Krabs' restaurant, the Krusty Krab. The Chum Bucket primarily sells chum (bait consisting of fish parts), which is considered mostly inedible by the other characters. As a result, his restaurant is a commercial failure. Plankton's primary goal in the series is to put Krabs out of business and secure a monopoly on the fast food industry. His villainous efforts to do this are widely known within the show; fellow character Squidward Tentacles refers to Plankton as \"the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom\".\n\nA running gag throughout the series is the fact that Plankton is smaller than the other regular characters; he is easily stepped on and sent flying back to the Chum Bucket with a mere flick of the finger. His small size has led him to develop a Napoleon complex, which is occasionally manifested as a desire for global domination. He is a skillful inventor and regularly builds machines, both to help him in his plots, and for his own personal gain. Although he uses his intellect for evil, Plankton did not start out as a villainous scientist; he built Karen, his first invention, when he was friends with Mr. Krabs in grade school. Prominent in his earliest appearances, Plankton's catchphrase is \"I went to college!\", uttered to illustrate the character's intelligence.\n\nPlankton's roles are not exclusively antagonistic. In \"\", Plankton discards his enmity for SpongeBob and works with him towards a common goal. The movie has been described by \"The Guardian\" as a \"buddy film\" between Plankton and SpongeBob. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg considers Plankton \"more of a caricature of a villain\" than a truly evil character.\n\nWhen \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" premiered, Plankton was not part of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, has stated that after producing Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: \"We'll probably do another [Plankton episode] next year,\" Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he \"was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really liked this character\". Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the third season the first in which Plankton is a main character.\n\nDuring production on \"SpongeBob\"s early seasons, Lawrence was the only staff member writing premises and outlines involving Plankton. At the time, he felt he \"had to prove Plankton could survive as more than a one-note character\". Since then, multiple writers have written for Plankton without Lawrence's involvement, including the teams of writers responsible for Plankton's starring roles in both \"SpongeBob\" films. Lawrence continues to write Plankton episodes, having said in 2015, \"I'm not just his voice. I get to create how the character is written and how he evolves over time.\"\n\nPreliminary design sketches for Plankton depict him in a robotic suit, with Karen's system built into it; that suit does not appear in the series. The suit functioned as a way to increase Plankton's presence, as one of Hillenburg's original intentions was for the character to be too small to see without a magnifying glass. As the series progressed, the animators enlarged Plankton's size, feeling that being microscopic was \"not conducive to him interacting with other characters\".\n\nPlankton's voice is provided by American actor Doug Lawrence, normally credited as \"Mr. Lawrence.\" The voice originated as an imitation of one of his deep-voiced high school friends. On television, Lawrence first used this voice for incidental characters on \"Rocko's Modern Life\". Fellow voice actor Tom Kenny found it amusing, leading to Lawrence's decision to use it when auditioning for roles on \"SpongeBob\". Lawrence initially tried out for the role of SpongeBob during the series' pre-production, but Stephen Hillenburg wanted a more innocent voice for the character and turned him down. Lawrence continued to work on the show, voicing minor characters, eventually leading to him being offered the role of Plankton for the \"Plankton!\" episode. He describes Plankton's voice as a \"combination of Gregory Peck and Tony the Tiger.\"\n\nWhen the \"Plankton!\" episode was pitched to Nickelodeon, Hillenburg had already decided that he wanted Lawrence to play Plankton. However, network executives wanted a guest star to provide his voice since he was set to appear in only one episode. Lawrence mentioned in an interview with fellow \"SpongeBob\" actor Thomas F. Wilson that the studio said, in his words, \"'we could stunt-cast this. You know, we could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve [Hillenburg] was just like, 'it's Doug, don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'\"\n\nThe Plankton character has garnered a generally positive reception over the run of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". In his review of the fourth season, Paul Mavis of \"DVD Talk\" stated that adult viewers would likely find Plankton more amusing than others, praising his \"hilariously stentorian\" voice. In his review of the season six episode \"Clash of Triton,\" Mavis called Plankton \"the only secondary \"SpongeBob\" character who can [successfully] anchor his own short\". Bettijane Levine of \"The Los Angeles Times\" wrote positively of Plankton's portrayal calling it poignant rather than genuinely immoral, describing him as a \"town meanie ... but mean is different than evil. There is no evil, not even a sense of menace, in SpongeBob's soggy, safe world.\" Ann Hagman Cardinal of Blogcritics praised the character, rhetorically asking in a 2007 review, \"who isn't tickled by the tight-jawed, Kirk Douglas-voiced Plankton with his silent moviesque evil plans to steal the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty?\" Boston.com writer Jamie Loftus had mixed feelings about Plankton in a 2015 article, asserting that while \"almost every episode featuring tiny supervillain Plankton is highly formulaic,\" he never \"gets old\".\n\nJames Poniewozik of \"Time\" magazine commented on Plankton in a 2001 article. He noted that \"no one thinks it's strange that the town villain, the megalomaniacal Plankton, is a one-celled organism\" as part of the \"colorful, goofy\" atmosphere of the program. In an article for \"The A.V. Club\", Zack Handlen stated that \"the humor of Plankton comes from how his operative ambitions are constantly thwarted by a naïve, trusting kid\". In 2015, \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Hillary Busis named Plankton one of the most devious characters on television, adding in her commentary that he is \"voiced to wicked perfection by Doug Lawrence\". of \"El Mundo\" favorably compared Plankton's plans to the stories of Georges Simenon in a 2013 article.\n\nIn his 2011 book \"SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy\", political scientist Joseph J. Foy argues that \"Plankton may actually be the unsung hero of the series, and SpongeBob the true villain.\" He compares the character to the Nietzschean \"Übermensch\", taking note of his mental superiority compared to the other characters in the show, and questions how Plankton is only \"judged as bad because, no matter how many great things he accomplishes, his intentions are deemed ignoble\". Foy concludes his analysis by criticizing the fact that \"SpongeBob is praised as noble for trying to hold Plankton back.\"\n\nSheldon Plankton is married to a supercomputer named Karen Plankton, who is also his sidekick and best friend. Karen is Plankton's own invention, assembled from a calculator and a mass of wires. She was Plankton's first invention when he was in grade school, and they dated before he became evil. Her system is built into most of Plankton's machines (including the Chum Bucket itself) so that she and Plankton can communicate while the latter is on a mission. She is a Mark II Surplus UNIVAC with 256 gigabytes of random-access memory.\n\nKaren assumes various jobs at the Chum Bucket, including busser, chef and cashier; she rarely has to fulfill them because of the restaurant's unpopularity. She also tends to stay more focused than Plankton on the core mission of stealing Krabs' formula. Karen often reminds him to stay on task and encourages him to keep going when he loses confidence. Since she lacks a heart, Karen is usually unable to feel empathy for the people around her. Her interactions are not limited to helping Plankton, however; she is a friend of Sandy Cheeks, who is also intelligent and interested in science. Karen has a habit of addressing SpongeBob as \"the SpongeBob.\"\n\nKaren is more competent than Plankton in formulating plots to steal the Krabby Patty recipe. Most of his effective plans have come from Karen, including \"Plan Z\"—the only scheme to result in Plankton successfully stealing the formula and using it to his advantage—in \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\". Nonetheless, he tends to take credit for them, much to her dismay. Karen has effortlessly stolen Krabs' formula without Plankton's help on many occasions, but her husband always inadvertently gets in the way. Because of their contrasting behaviors, Plankton and Karen have a tendency to argue. Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, has called their marriage \"\"Honeymooners\"-like,\" comparing them to the bickering couple from the sitcom \"The Honeymooners\".\n\nAs a computer on the ocean floor, Karen's ability to operate underwater has not been explained in any of the series' episodes. Tom Kenny addressed this in a 2004 interview with the Associated Press, stating that Karen's functionality is a \"don't-ask-why\" aspect of \"SpongeBob\" and that \"logic doesn't have a place\" in the series' universe.\n\nKaren was also created by Stephen Hillenburg, who named the character after his wife. Hillenburg initially designed a laboratory for Plankton to convey the character's technological abilities, leading to Karen's development as his lab's central computer system. Like Plankton, she was not initially intended to be a main character; her role in the series grew as Lawrence wrote ideas to give the Planktons more personality. Throughout the series' first and second seasons, Karen is not defined as Plankton's wife; Plankton's official biography from 2000 simply states that he works \"with the help of his computer, Karen\".\n\nIn the series' third season opener, 2002's \"The Algae's Always Greener,\" Plankton refers to Karen as his wife for the first time. Aspects of their marriage, such as their anniversary and their honeymoon, have become the frequent focus of episodes since then. In early episodes, Karen is always supportive and friendly toward her husband. But, as the series progresses, she becomes more cynical and sarcastic because of Plankton's relentless obsession with the Krabby Patty formula. However, she remains loving and affectionate toward him.\n\nMany episodes written by Lawrence develop and explore the relationship between Karen and her husband. Lawrence has stated that he feels Karen makes Plankton-focused episodes more humorous and that her presence helps portray him as a multidimensional character. In a 2009 interview with Andy Goodman, he said, \"I want more Karen on the show ... The married life of an evil genius is the funniest thing to me, so in that regard [Karen] definitely enhances Plankton's stories, making him more than just your typical bad guy.\"\n\nMost of Karen's appearances in the first four seasons depict her as a large, blue monitor in the Chum Bucket's laboratory; at other times, only her voice is heard from within Plankton's robotic creations. In \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\", a mobile unit is introduced to allow Karen to interact more easily with others. Showrunner Vincent Waller stated that the mobile unit was introduced because having Karen able to move was more convenient for storytelling purposes. Karen alternates between her multiple forms in most episodes produced after the film. As of the tenth season, her wall monitor is no longer used and her mobile form is always equipped with a pair of robotic arms.\n\nKaren is voiced by American actress Jill Talley, who is also the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Whenever Karen talks, her voice is mixed over electronic sound effects by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound. Her voice, which was more monotonous in earlier episodes, has been described as \"deadpan\" by the Associated Press. Some of Karen's conversations with Plankton are improvised between Talley and Lawrence. The latter described this improvisation as one of his \"favorite part[s] of the voice over\" in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, \"I always enjoy the back-and-forth. [Talley and I] start to actually overlap so much talking to each other that [the voice directors] have to tell us, 'hey, stop doing that, separate what you're saying!'\" Lawrence also feels that voicing the characters for so long has built a close relationship between the two actors. On the topic, he said, \"This on-TV marriage we have, the whole world knows us being married ... We start becoming a married couple [when recording].\"\n\nKaren has received generally positive reactions from critics. In a 2010 review of \"SpongeBob's Last Stand\", DVD Talk's Paul Mavis wrote highly of Karen and Plankton's dialogue, stating that the two \"could have their own sitcom\". Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media praised the amount of screen time given to Karen in \"Sponge Out of Water\", calling her \"hilarious\". In 2015, Boston.com's Jamie Loftus cited Karen as her reason for naming 2002's \"Welcome to the Chum Bucket\" one of the sixteen greatest \"SpongeBob\" episodes. Gizmodo's Ryan Lufkin wrote in 2016 that \"SpongeBob\"s \"90s-level weirdness\" is proven by characters like Plankton and Karen. The About Group's Nancy Basile commended Jill Talley's portrayal of the character, saying that it is \"no surprise she plays [the role] so well\" due to her earlier work with Second City and \"Mr. Show\".\n\nIn an analysis of how the show has changed throughout its run, Channel Frederator argued that the main characters of \"SpongeBob\"–specifically Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Karen–have been reduced from multidimensional to reliant on single traits. According to this view, \"Karen is now a full-blown nag\" in newer episodes. This aspect of Karen's character has also been criticized by author Joseph J. Foy, in his book \"SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy\". He considers this trope one of several harmful stereotypes present on the program, writing that \"the motif of the nagging wife is certainly an issue worthy of dissection in dealing with a young audience, along with the spoiled teen daughter <nowiki>[</nowiki>Pearl<nowiki>]</nowiki> and the stupid best friend <nowiki>[</nowiki>Patrick<nowiki>]</nowiki>\".\n\nLampooning a controversy surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality, essayist Dennis Hans wrote a 2005 satirical piece for the \"National Catholic Reporter\" focusing on the marriage of Plankton and Karen. He remarked, in jest, that SpongeBob's sexual orientation was a lesser issue compared to the positive representation of Plankton's \"technosexuality\". Hans identified instances where both Planktons were portrayed as a loving couple and joked: \"the subliminal message from SpongeBob's insidious creators ... [is that] the technosexual lifestyle means bonding forever with your one true love\".\n\nPlankton and Karen have been featured in various forms of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" merchandise, including video games and action figures. In 2006, Ty Inc.'s Beanie Babies introduced a plush toy based on Plankton. A Lego building set based on the Chum Bucket, including a Plankton minifigure and his laboratory with Karen, was released in 2007. The fourteenth issue of \"SpongeBob Comics\", titled \"Plankton Comics,\" is centered around the Planktons and includes six original stories set at the Chum Bucket. The 2013 video game \"\" is Plankton-themed and features Lawrence and Jill Talley reprising their voice roles from the show as Plankton and Karen.\n\nPlankton and Karen appear in several Nickelodeon crossover works, including 2005's \"Nicktoons Unite!\" game and one of its sequels, \"\". Both games feature the Chum Bucket as a playing location and in the latter, Plankton is a player character. Additionally, Plankton and Karen are both mentioned by Eric Lange (as his character Sikowitz) in \"Tori Goes Platinum,\" an episode of Nickelodeon's sitcom \"Victorious\".\nSea World Australia's \"SpongeBob ParadePants\" event, which opened in December 2011, included a float featuring Karen and a talking Plankton. In 2015, a recreation of Plankton's laboratory was constructed for a \"SpongeBob\" event at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Zhongzheng District, Taipei. It included a replica of Karen's monitor, functioning as a television, screening episodes of \"SpongeBob\", and a miniature Plankton statue.\n\nThe Flaming Lips' song \"SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy,\" recorded for \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\", closes with several lines focusing on Plankton and Karen. The song characterizes Plankton as a confused faultfinder who would be much happier if he stopped focusing on his failures and complaining to Karen. Plankton sings a track on the novelty album \"The Best Day Ever\" titled \"You Will Obey,\" on which Elvis Presley's former guitarist James Burton played guitar. Of the album, Tom Kenny said \"one of our hidden Easter eggs that hopefully more than three people in the world will get is during the guitar solo when Plankton says 'Take it, James', which was what Elvis said in every one of those concert movies\". Film composer John Debney produced Plankton's theme music for the second \"SpongeBob\" movie, using low brass and trombones. The film's includes several tracks named after Plankton, including \"Plankton Rescues Karen,\" which is used during a scene highlighting Plankton's cooperation with hero SpongeBob.\n\nPlankton and Karen are the central antagonists in the Broadway production \"The SpongeBob Musical\". In it they are portrayed by Nick Blaemire and Stephanie Hsu. In addition to wearing costumes inspired by the characters, Blaemire and Hsu sing a musical number (titled \"When the Going Gets Tough,\" composed by T.I.) along with a Plankton puppet and a replica of Karen's mobile form. The plot features them attempting to hypnotize the residents of Bikini Bottom into liking the food they serve at the Chum Bucket. In 2009, actor Andy Peart portrayed Plankton in the musical adaptation of the third-season episode \"The Sponge Who Could Fly\". Viv Hardwick of \"The Northern Echo\" positively reviewed the production and noted that Peart had very similar mannerisms to the cartoon Plankton.\n\n"}

They divorced when Renata was just one year old.\nShe attended VGIK in 1984 and graduated in 1989. She attended the same year as fellow screenwriters and directors Roman Kachanov and Arkady Vysotsky. It is here where she worked on her first film as a screenwriter for the film \"The Much Loved rita. The Last Meeting with Her\" (1988).\n\nShe began her film career as a screenwriter, writing films from 1988 to 1998. None of her earlier projects such as \"Truck Drivers 2\" (1992) achieved any critical or commercial acclaim.\nShe was discovered by fellow director Kira Muratova in 1994 after Muratova had come across Litvinova's thesis she had written for VGIK. \nMeeting one another at a local festival, Muratova changed her mind and instead wanted Litvinova to star in one of her films.\nLitvinova auditioned for the role of the female protagonist Violet but was deemed unsuitable. \nHowever, Muratova wanted her in the film and allowed her to write a role for herself. Litvinova wrote herself into the film as a nurse.\nShe continued to write screenplays after her role, which included both \"Male Revelations\" (1995) and \"Principled and Compassionate View\" (1995). The latter film won the Jury prize at the \"Window to Europe\" Film festival and was showcased in a number of other festivals around the world such as Japan and Germany. \nShe collaborated with Muratova again in 1997 and 1998, writing two screenplays that Muratova directed. \nLetanova's screenplay \"Three Stories\" was turned into a film in 1997, she also played the role of Opha in it. Her story \"To Own and Belong\" was adapted into the critically acclaimed crime film \"Country of the Deaf\" in 1998. In 2017 Renata made her full debut in theatre with her own piece called \"The North Wind\" in Moscow Art Theatre. She was the director and screenwriter, as well as she played the key role in \"The North Wind\".\n\nIn 2000, she gained popularity after transitioning from a screenwriter to an actress, playing the role of Albino Crow in the show \"The Border\" She wrote screenplays for films sparingly after this role and starred in all of the films she wrote. Litvinova became acclaimed in the mid-2000s when she was nominated for her roles in \"Sky. Plane. Girl.\" (2002), \"The Tuner\" (2004) and \"I’m Not Hurt\" (2006).\n\nShe made her directorial debut in 2000 with the documentary \"There is No Death For Me\". The film focused on the experiences of Litvinova's favorite Soviet Era actresses and gave insight into her views on their stories. As with her screenwriting, she directed sparingly in between her acting roles, directing six films since 2000. She directed her first feature film in 2004, \"\", which she also wrote and starred in. In 2006, she directed her first short film, \"Rado\". Litvinova made her first foray into concert films in 2008 when she directed the film \"Green Theatre in Zemfira\". The film was created using footage from a concert of one of Litvinova's friends, musical artist Zemfira Ramazanova. The film won \"music film of the year\" from independent music award show \"Steppenwolf\". The two collaborated again in 2010 to create another Ramazanova concert film directed by Litvinova called \"Moscow. Crokus/Arrow\".

{"id": "37410424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37410424", "title": "Richard Gibson (painter)", "text": "Richard Gibson (painter)\n\nRichard Gibson (1615-1690), known as \"Dwarf Gibson\", was a painter of portrait miniatures and a court dwarf in England during the reigns of Charles I, Oliver Cromwell, Charles II, and William III and Mary II.\n\nBoth Andrew Marvell and Edmund Waller wrote poems addressed to him.\n\nHis early life is undocumented, but he is said to have been a page in the service of a lady in Mortlake, who recognised his artistic talent. She supported him to study art under Francis Cleyn, director of design at the Mortlake Tapestry Works. In the 1630s, Gibson was working for Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, who was the Lord Chamberlain. He is referred to as \"little Dick, my lord Chamberlain's page\" in notebooks recording a number of copies he made of existing paintings in royal and aristocratic collections. At the same time he was producing original portrait paintings for aristocratic clients. Herbert was his most important early patron, and may have introduced him to Peter Lely, with whom Gibson would enjoy a close and productive relationship. Lely painted several portraits of Gibson.\n\nGibson was appointed \"Page of the Back Stairs\" under Charles I. During the English Civil War Gibson stayed in London with Pembroke, and thus became associated with the Parliamentary faction. By the 1650s Gibson appears to have been closely linked to Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon, grandson of the Earl of Pembroke. During Cromwell's regime he remained active as a painter at the Protector's court. However, Gibson's patrons in the 1650s are typically Royalists, but generally of the faction that had been supporters of parliament early in the war.\n\nHis association with Cromwell did not affect his career under Charles II. Gibson was employed as drawing-master to Princess Mary and Princess Anne, the daughters of Charles' brother James (later King James II). He went with Mary to the Netherlands for her marriage to William of Orange in 1677. He came back to England in 1688 when William and Mary became monarchs after the overthrow of James II.\n\n Gibson married Anne Shepherd, who was known as the \"queen's dwarf\", as she was in the service of Queen Henrietta Maria. The couple were both said to be 3 ft 10 inches tall. The wedding was held at court, and the bride was given away by King Charles I. The event was the occasion of a poem by Edmund Waller, in which the pair are described as literally made for each other (\"Design or chance make others wive, / But nature did this match contrive\").\n\nThe couple had nine children, of whom three became successful painters. The best known of these was Gibson's daughter Susan, who also worked as a miniature painter, using her married name of Susan Penelope Rosse. All the Gibson children were of typical size.\n\nThe Grove Dictionary of Art states that \"the miniatures assigned to Gibson are characterized by the thick pigment and parallel striations that give his work an impastoed quality\". His colours are typically soft and muted, anticipating the miniaturists of the 18th century. During the 1650s Gibson may have become so successful that he had to employ assistants, suggested by the existence of \"Gibson-style but not Gibson-quality works\" at this period. His children might have learned their skills this way. He also seems to have been adopting a \"brighter palette\" at this time, to suit the tastes of the Restoration court. W. Sanderson's book \"Graphice\" (1658) describes Gibson as one of the most eminent of modern \"limners\".\n\nArt historians John Murdoch and V. J. Murrell say that the distinguishing feature of Gibson's style is the \"diagonal striation in the flesh painting\".\n\nEven by the naked eye, the coloured strokes of the brush over the carnation ground can be seen to consist of long broad hatches, which have often the tendency, especially in the flat plane of the forehead and the shadowing of the throat below the chin line, to move in diagonal parallel groups of hatches, stroked downwards from right to left...[Gibson's paint] is \"impasted\" in the manner of oil painting and is quite different from the traditionally transparent and linear technique of the limners.\n\nThese techniques probably imply the influence of Lely. His adoption of a more \"wide eyed\" look in his Restoration-era works may also show the influence of Lely.\n\nAndrew Marvell, in his mock epic poem \"The Third Advice to a Painter\", addresses Gibson, joking on the fact that the artist who painted miniatures was himself of miniature stature. He refers to him as the \"admiral\" of his \"navy small, of marshalled shells\", whose small-scale works demonstrate by \"drawing in little, how we do yet less\". The poem becomes an extended satire on recent political and military events, especially the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Marvell suggests that Gibson should paint miniaturised epic works about events, to represent the minuscule achievements of the real admirals and statesmen in the war. Lely could not paint the works because he is tainted by his own Dutch origin, but Gibson represents authentically tiny English aspirations.\n\nIt has been argued that a number of miniatures signed with the monogram \"DG\" are the work of Gibson, on the grounds that they are \"stylistically inseparable\" from his known work of a later period, which is usually signed \"RG\". The \"DG\" miniatures appear to date from the artist's early career when no examples of his work with his usual \"RG\" monogram are known. If this is so, it is possible that the artist proudly adopted the nickname \"Dwarf Gibson\" as his signature. Alternatively, it may have stood for \"Dick Gibson\", the version of his name by which he was known in his youth.\n\n"}

The ascent of the family to the aristocracy was through marriage.\n\nThe family's arms were described in 1852 as:\nQuarterly: 1st and 4th, or, on a fesse, dancettée, with plain cotises between three billets, sa., each charged with a lion, rampant, of the field, as many bezants; 2nd, gu., an eagle, displayed, barry of six, erminois and az.; 3rd, or, a saltier, sa., in chief, a leopard's face, of the second.\n\nJames James of the parish of Llanvihangel-Ystern-Llewern, Monmouthshire, son of John James the Elder, purchased several farms and parcels of land in Llanvihangel-Ystern-Llewern and Llangattock-Vibon-Avel between 1639 and 1648. He settled in London and acquired a valuable estate in along the area of Old Kent Road between the parishes of Bermondsey and Camberwell (both now part of Southwark) Surrey.\n\nIn his will published in 1677 he left his estate to his only surviving child, Sarah, who was the wife of Dr Elisha Coysh, a physician from London. Their daughter married William Allen, who also bought land in Monmouthshire. William Allen's daughter and heir married her cousin Thomas Coysh.\n\nThey were succeeded by their son Richard, who was succeeded by his sister Sarah Coysh (d. 1801), the eventual sole heir of the families of Coysh, Allen and James. Sarah married John Rolls (1735–1801) of the Grange, Bermondsey, and of the Hendre, Monmouthshire, High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1794, bringing him much property both in Monmouthshire and London. John Rolls died the day after his wife.\n\nJohn was succeeded by his son John Rolls (1776–1837) who, with his wife Martha, built the finest country estate in Monmouthshire: The Hendre (). It was a shooting lodge that was expanded throughout the next one hundred years. It is Monmouthshire's only full-scale Victorian country house, constructed in the Victorian Gothic style. It is located in the parish of Llangattock-Vibon-Avel, some north-west of the town of Monmouth. The first of three expansions by the Rolls family began with the architect George Vaughan Maddox who rebuilt parts of the south wing in 1830. John Rolls' successor, John Etherington Welch Rolls, continued the mansion's development, using Thomas Henry Wyatt as his architect. \nJohn was succeeded by his son John Etherington Welch Rolls (4 May 1807 – 27 May 1870), sheriff of Monmouthshire. In 1842 he married Elizabeth Mary Long, granddaughter of William Carnegie, 7th Earl of Northesk. He was succeeded by his son, also named John.\nJohn Allan Rolls (19 February 1837 – 24 September 1912), sheriff in 1875 and MP for Monmouthshire, 1880–1885, created Baron Llangattock of the Hendre, 1892.\n\nJohn Allan Rolls's ennoblement brought the family, and the house, to its social apogee, culminating in a visit from the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary), who stayed with Lord and Lady Llangattock at the Hendre in late October – early November 1900. The Duke and Duchess were taken on motor car excursions by Charles Rolls, probably the first time that the royal couple had been in a car. This was an important event in the family's social history, confirming their elevation to the upper echelons of society.\n\nOf John Allan's three sons, the most famous was Charles, the co-founder of Rolls Royce. \n\nCharles Stewart Rolls (27 August 1877 - 12 July 1910) was a motoring and aviation pioneer. Together with Frederick Henry Royce he co-founded the Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in a flying accident, when the tail of his Wright Flyer broke off during a flying display near Bournemouth, England. He was aged 32.\nAs well as his interests in cars and aeroplanes, Charles was a keen balloonist, the Flight Magazine of January 1909 recording a flight from Monmouth:\n\n\"Ballooning Home\". On Saturday last the Hon. C. S. Rolls gave an exhibition of the possibilities of ballooning by taking his mother, Lady Llangattock, home by balloon. The ascent was made at Monmouth in the balloon \" Mercury,\" the occupants of the basket being Lady Llangattock, Hon. C. S. Rolls, Hon. Mrs. Assheton – Harbord, Mr. Claud Crompton, and Mr. Charles Freeman, and the balloon landed on the lawn in front of Lord Llangattock's house, The Hendre.\n\nIn July 1910, Charles Rolls was killed when his plane crashed during a flight display at Bournemouth, the first Englishman to be killed in a flying accident.\n\nLord Llangattock died in 1912. His heir was his first son John Maclean Rolls (1870–1916, dsp.), 2nd Baron Llangattock. He died at Boulogne in 1916 from wounds received at the Battle of the Somme. With his younger brother, Henry Alan, having died four months previously, and none of Lord Llangattock's three sons having had children, the direct male line ended. John Maclean Rolls was succeeded by his sister Eleanor Georgiana (d. 1961), wife of John Courtown Edward Shelley.\n\nWith the death of Charles Rolls, Henry Allen Rolls and John Maclean Rolls and the extinction of the barony and surname in the male line, the estate passed back up the family through the closest member of the family with surviving descendants, Patricia Rolls, sister of John Allan Rolls. She had married John Taylor Harding of Pentwyn, vicar of Rockfield and Canon of Llandaff, son of John Harding of Henbury and Jane Morgan, and they had four children (John Reginald Harding, Charles Allan Harding, Francis Henry Harding and George Valentine Harding). John Reginald Harding in turn married Elizabeth Margaret Saunders (daughter of Captain John Saunders of Fuzhou, China) and had five children. Upon the extinction of the Rolls branch, the estate came down to his son, John Charles Etherington Harding (born 1898, Xiamen), the first cousin once removed of the 2nd Baron Llangattock, who inherited the house, estate and surrounding farmland, changing his family name to Harding-Rolls for this purpose.\nThe Harding-Rolls branch of the family continued to live at The Hendre until 30 August 1984 when, following a failed time-share operation, it was sold to Effold Properties Limited. The mansion is now the focal point of the Rolls of Monmouth golf course.\n\n\n"}

But somewhere during his teen years, the salt laden sea breeze in Kannur and the hype of World War-II instilled in him a wander lust, quest for adventure, a perception that soldiering was more interesting than doctoring.\n\nAdmiral Ronald Lynsdale Pereira was commissioned into the Royal Indian Navy on his 20th birthday (May 25, 1943), given command of a homemade, quickly fitted out, leaky wooden fishing trawler masquerading as a gun boat, with a dozen sailors as raw as Ronnie, and immediately sent to fight the might of the Japanese Navy in the Bay Of Bengal.

He is a poet, a singer-songwriter, an international speaker and a writer. He is the author of \"Soon Will Come the Light: A View From Inside the Autism Puzzle\" and \"Light On the Horizon: A Deeper View From Inside the Autism Puzzle\". McKean has claimed that he did not speak until he was 16, but was able to describe how autism was like to him. He constantly fights various symptoms such as making strange noises, and says that perception of the senses causes low-intensity pain. McKean at one time earned a living traveling about and doing conferences and consulting work on autism. He has been described as having the unusual ability to be in the world of autism, yet also possesses the communication skills to describe what that world is like.\n\nMcKean claimed that he was never given a formal diagnosis growing up, so he was often punished, even though he knew there was something wrong with him. He spent the first half of his elementary school career in a regular classroom, then was in special-education classrooms until the sixth grade. He also claimed to be unpopular in school, and dreaded gym and recess. McKean then spent three years in a psychiatric institution starting at age 14. However, he was eventually elected to the board of the Autism Society of America in 1992. He started his advocacy career after discovering that he was on the spectrum, through attending Autism Society of America chapter meetings and receiving attention for being able to talk about his own experiences as an autistic person.\n\nThomas McKean was a guest on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2001. On the show, he said that he was lonely as a child, had to learn emotions, and said that his sensitivity to certain sensations and colors was exaggerated. McKean was also featured in \"Esquire\" magazine.\n\nIn \"Soon Will Come the Light: A View From Inside the Autism Puzzle\", a winner of the Autism Society of America's Literary Achievement Award, he described the years that he faced confusion around his disorder. He also claimed to have talents in fields such as computers and technical design, in addition to his passion for writing. This book was one of the first autobiographies to provide unique insight into the world of autism. Janis M. Serak, a member of the Autism Society of America, Board of Directors, reviewed the book in \"The Advocate\", the Autism Society of America's newsletter in 1994. Serak claimed that few books had been written by autistics, and that this book could be useful to parents of autistic children for its first-person portrayal of autism. Overall, he wrote that McKean had sought to understand himself better through writing.\n\nMcKean has stated that some people who claim to have autism on the internet portray a very distorted and unrealistic view of what autism really is. These people say autism is the best thing ever and some of them even say it places above the general population and makes them better or superior in some way. He has described the politics of autism as a distraction from the therapies and support needed to treat those who have it. In his 2006 essay \"A Danger in Speaking\" that McKean questions autistic speakers that have been self-diagnosed. Critics say that this ignores the obstacles and stigma that some autistics face in getting diagnosed.\n"}

He joined the fight against the Spaniards since the start of the revolution. He later became a one-term governor of Cavite from 1910 to 1912.\n\nTomás Mascardo was born in the town of Cavite del Viejo (now Kawit, Cavite province) to Valentín Mascardo and Dolores Echenique. The affluent couple, a landowner and a rice dealer, respectively, had a total of seven children. Tomás finished his teacher's diploma from Escuela Normal in Manila and became a teacher at the barrio school of Halang in Amadeo, Cavite.\n\nMascardo joined the revolution against the Spaniards from the beginning. He became the chief of the revolutionary intelligence service in Manila, succeeding Miguel Liedo who was captured and sentenced to death by the Spaniards. He was ordered by General Emilio Aguinaldo to attack a Spanish stronghold in Tanauan, Batangas, where the general was awed by Mascardo’s courage. In time, he was promoted to brigadier general. Mascardo, together with his commander, General Edilberto Evangelista, fought at the Battle of Zapote Bridge on February 17, 1897 where Evangelista was killed and Mascardo wounded.\n\nDuring the Philippine-American War, Mascardo was assigned as commanding general of the revolutionary forces in Pampanga, Bataan, and Zambales provinces with barracks in Bagac, Bataan. Following Aguinaldo's capture by the Americans on March 23, 1901 in Palanan, Isabela, he ordered his subordinate, Major Manuel L. Quezon, to surrender as well so he can verify the capture and if so, consult Aguinaldo for final orders as there was also an order for Mascardo to surrender. Quezon was able to meet Aguinaldo in a room at the Malacañang Palace where he was detained. After relaying Mascardo’s message, Aguinaldo instructed Quezon that the decision to surrender is up to Mascardo himself. On May 15, 1901, he surrendered to the Americans. He calculated that their deficiency in weaponry would mean sure defeat from the well-armed Americans.\n\nMascardo returned to Cavite following his release by the Americans. He was influenced to enter politics, and won the gubernatorial seat of Cavite, a post he held from 1910 to 1912. He retired and lived a private life after only one term. On July 7, 1932, he died from a heart disease.\n\nTomás Mascardo was married to Carmen Topacio of Imus, Cavite. The couple had eight children – Modesto, Dominador (who became a general), Petra, Pura, Jaime, Tomás, Salvador (a former collector of customs at the Manila International Airport), and Emiliano.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "141024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141024", "title": "Uther Pendragon", "text": "Uther Pendragon\n\nUther Pendragon (; ), also known as King Uther, is a legendary king of sub-Roman Britain and the father of King Arthur. A few minor references to Uther appear in Old Welsh poems, but his biography was first written down by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"), and Geoffrey's account of the character was used in most later versions. He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature, but is described as a strong king and a defender of the people.\n\nAccording to Arthurian Legend, Merlin magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy Gorlois, enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady Igraine. Thus Arthur, \"the once and future king\", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in Malory, emphasizes that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of illegitimate conception is repeated in Arthur's siring of Mordred by his own half-sister Morgause in the later prose romances; it is Mordred who mortally wounds King Arthur in the Battle of Camlann.\n\nUther's epithet \"Pendragon\" (composed of Welsh \"pen\", \"head, chief, top\" and \"dragon\", \"dragon; warrior\"; borrowed from the Latin word \"dracō\", plural \"dracōnēs\", \"dragon[s]\") literally means \"Chief-Dragon\" or \"Head-Dragon\", but in a figurative sense, \"chief leader\", \"chief of warriors\", \"commander-in-chief\", \"generalissimo\", or \"chief governor\". The name was misinterpreted by Geoffrey of Monmouth in \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" to mean \"dragon's head\". According to Geoffrey and works based on his version, Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous dragon-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his standards. According to Robert de Boron and the cycles based on his work, it was Uther's older brother (elsewhere called Aurelius Ambrosius) who saw the comet and received the name \"Pendragon\", Uther taking his epithet after his death.\n\nThough the Welsh tradition of the Arthurian legend is fragmentary, some material exists through the Welsh Triads and various poems. Uther appears in these fragments, where he is associated with Arthur and, in some cases, even appears as his father.\n\nHe is mentioned in the circa-10th-century Arthurian poem \"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\" (\"What man is the gatekeeper?\"), where it is only said of him that Mabon son of Modron is his servant. He is also memorialized with \"The Death-song of Uther Pen\" from the \"Book of Taliesin\". The latter includes a reference to Arthur, so the marginal addition of \"dragon\" to Uther's name is probably justified. \"The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle,\" a poem contemporary with but independent of Geoffrey, mentions another son of Uther named Madoc, the father of Arthur's nephew Eliwlod.\n\nIn Triad 28, Uthyr is named the creator of one of the Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain, which he taught to the wizard Menw. Since Menw is a shapeshifter according to \"Culhwch and Olwen\", it might be that Uther was one as well. If this is so, it opens up the possibility that Geoffrey of Monmouth's narrative about Uther impregnating Igerna with Merlin's help (see below) was taken from a Welsh legend where Uthyr changed his own shape, Merlin possibly being added to the story by Geoffrey.\n\nUthyr's other reference, Triad 51, however, shows influence from Geoffrey's \"Historia\". It follows Geoffrey's description of Uther as son of Constantine III, now called \"Custennin the Blessed\", and brother of both Aurelius Ambrosius (\"Emrys Wledig\") and Constans II (\"Custennin the Younger\").\n\nUther is best known from Geoffrey's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (1136) where he is the youngest son of King of Britannia, Constantine III. His eldest brother Constans succeeds to the throne on their father's death, but is murdered at the instigation of his adviser Vortigern, who seizes the throne. Uther and his other brother, Aurelius Ambrosius, still children, flee to Brittany. Vortigern makes an alliance with the Saxons under Hengist, but it goes disastrously wrong. Aurelius and Uther return, now adults. Aurelius burns Vortigern in his castle and becomes king.\n\nWith Aurelius on the throne, Uther leads his brother in arms to Ireland to help Merlin bring the stones of Stonehenge from there to Britain. Later, while Aurelius is ill, Uther leads his army against Vortigern's son Paschent and his Saxon allies. On the way to the battle, he sees a comet in the shape of a dragon, which Merlin interprets as presaging Aurelius's death and Uther's glorious future. Uther wins the battle and takes the epithet \"Pendragon\", and returns to find that Aurelius has been poisoned by an assassin. He becomes king and orders the construction of two gold dragons, one of which he uses as his standard. \n\nHe secures Britain's frontiers and quells Saxon uprisings with the aids of his retainers, one of whom is Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall. At a banquet celebrating their victories, Uther becomes obsessively enamoured of Gorlois' wife Igerna (Igraine), and a war ensues between Uther and his vassal. Gorlois sends Igerna to the impregnable castle of Tintagel for protection while he himself is besieged by Uther in another town. Uther consults with Merlin who uses his magic to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access to Igerna at Tintagel. He spends the night with her and they conceive Arthur, but the next morning it is discovered that Gorlois had been killed. Uther marries Igerna and they have a daughter called Anna (in later romances she is called Morgause and is usually Igerna's daughter by her previous marriage). Morgause later marries King Lot and becomes the mother of Gawain and Mordred.\n\nUther later falls ill and the wars begin to go badly against the Saxons. He insists on leading his army himself, propped up on his horse. He defeats Hengist's son Octa at Verulamium (St Albans), despite the Saxons calling him the \"Half-Dead King\". However, the Saxons soon contrive his death by poisoning a spring which he drinks from near Verulamium.\n\nUther's family is based on some historical figures; Constantine on the historical Constantine III, a usurper claimant to the Roman throne from 407–411, and Constans on his son. Aurelius Ambrosius is Ambrosius Aurelianus, mentioned by Gildas, though his connection to Constantine and Constans is unrecorded.\n\nIn Robert de Boron's \"Merlin\" Uther Pendragon kills Hengist after an assassination attempt by the Saxon leader and Merlin creates the Round Table for him. In the \"Prose Lancelot\" Uther Pendragon claims to have been born in Bourges. He takes an army to Brittany to fight against King Claudas of Bourges, a situation resembling that of the historical ruler Riothamus who went to Brittany to fight ravagers based in Bourges.\n\nThere is an alternative account of Uther Pendragon's background in Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\". A certain Mazadân went with a fairy named Terdelaschoye to the land of Feimurgân. (This looks like a garbling of some source that told of Mazadân's alliance with the Fay Morgan in Terre de la Joye; the \"Land of Joy\".) Mazadân becomes father of two sons, Lazaliez and Brickus. Brickus becomes father of Utepandragûn, father of Arthur, while the elder son, Lazaliez, becomes father of Gandin of Anjou, father of Gahmuret, father of Parzival (Percival). Uther Pendragon and Arthur here appear as the scions of the junior branch of an unattested House of Anjou.\n\nUther also appears in the chivalric romance \"Sir Cleges\" as the king to whom Sir Cleges brings the Christmas cherries, obtained by miracle.\n\nUther Pendragon remains a widely used character in modern Arthurian literature and other fiction. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was imprisoned before World War II for his anti-fascist activities. As a senior partisan he was involved in the death of Benito Mussolini, possibly being the individual who killed the dictator and his mistress. After the war he served as an Italian deputy and later as a senator.\n\nIn school, Audisio rose to the top of his class, and first worked making Borsalino hats. Next he worked for years as an accountant before entering a group of clandestine anti-fascists in 1931. The local group was discovered by the Italian secret police, the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism (\"Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell'Antifascismo\", or OVRA) and in 1934, Audisio was sentenced to five years confinement on the island of Ponza. Released during World War II, he resumed his activities against the government of Benito Mussolini, and in September 1943 he started to organize the first bands of partisans in Casale Monferrato. During this time he held jobs in the Fascist civil service.\n\nDuring the war, he joined the Italian Communist Party and became the inspector of the Garibaldi Brigades, a faction of the National Liberation Committee (CNL), commanding the formations operating in the Province of Mantova and the Po Valley. By January 1945, he had become the principal figure of the Italian resistance movement in Milan. He used the \"Nom de guerre\" \"Comandante Valerio\", a name possibly also used by Luigi Longo. As an official of the National Liberation Committee, he received an order on April 28, 1945 to enter Dongo and enforce the capital punishment that had been decreed against Mussolini and others in the fascist hierarchy. The death of Mussolini remains shrouded in mystery today, but Audisio always claimed that he was the one who shot and killed the dictator and his mistress, Claretta Petacci.\n\nAfter the war Audisio continued working with the communist movement, and in 1948, was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies for Alessandria with the Italian Communist Party as part of the Popular Democratic Front. He supported the party until 1963, when he entered the Italian Senate. In 1968 he left to work for Italian gasoline company Eni. He died five years later in 1973 of a heart attack. His memoirs, titled \"In nome del popolo italiano\", were published two years after his death, in 1975.\n"}

During this time, Cosmos would often be seen teaching his ideas about nudism on street corners in Ames, Iowa City, and Des Moines, Iowa. He referred to himself as the \"founder and bishop\" of the Nudist Christian Church of the Blessed Virgin Jesus. By the end of 1984, he claimed to have attracted 50 followers in Ames.\n\nCosmos was referring to himself as the bishop of the NCCBVJ as early as November 1984. In 1985, Cosmos said that God commanded him to travel to the Utah–Arizona border; while in this area, Cosmos says that God and an angel named Ephygeneia appeared to him naked and told him to go to a cave on a nearby ridge. While in the cave, God and the angel appeared again and gave Cosmos a revelation, which Cosmos recorded and named the Book of Zevs (also found as the Book of Zeus). The NCCBVJ teaches that the Book of Zevs is scripture that adds to and complements the Bible.\n\nThe Book of Zevs instructs Cosmos to build a nudist community city called \"Cosmos\", which was to be situated northwest of the Grand Canyon. The book also condemns Mormon fundamentalists near the Utah–Arizona border for their practice of plural marriage and their belief in the inferiority of black people.\n\nThe NCCBVJ teaches that nudity is a foundational state of being for leading a good life. It teaches that problems with sexuality, body image, pornography, and crime would all be solved if society would adopt a nudist lifestyle. Cosmos and the church have also led protests against female genital mutilation and male circumcision, which are viewed as equally undesirable.\n\nIn January 1985, Cosmos was investigated by the American Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities after complaints were made of Cosmos's preaching and sale of pro-nudity bumper stickers and T-shirts on street corners in Ames, Iowa. When it was discovered that Cosmos had exceeded the 6-month stay permitted by his visitor's visa, he was ordered deported to Canada. His appeal to a federal immigration judge was rejected and he was flown to Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nOn 31 October 1985 Cosmos was stopped by police as he was placing flyers on car windshields near Drake University in Des Moines. The police told him that a city ordinance forbade the distribution of literature in this manner. In December 1985, the Iowa Civil Liberties Union filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa on behalf of Cosmos, arguing that the ordinance unreasonably limited Cosmos's right to freedom of speech.\n\nIn August 2002, police in Washington, D.C. alleged that Cosmos had vandalized the National Mall and President's Park with swastikas and Nazi SS symbols during the American Independence Day weekend in 1999.\n\nOn 21 April 2006, Cosmos was arrested in Colorado City, Arizona and charged with being a public nuisance. The police reported that he had been leaving flyers containing nude photographs of himself in residents' mailboxes.\n"}
