{"id": "1993519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1993519", "title": "Chen Yonglin", "text": "Chen Yonglin\n\nChen Yonglin () is a former Chinese diplomat who sparked fears of a diplomatic incident through his defection to Australia in the summer of 2005. The episode highlighted the tensions faced by China's trade partners when concerns arise from that nation's human rights record. The episode was compared to the Petrov Affair by such observers as Shadow Minister for Immigration Laurie Ferguson and trade unionist Bill Shorten.\n\nChen had been a university student in Beijing during the pro-democracy movement that ultimately led to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Several of his friends were wounded in the ensuing repression by the government. He was said to have undergone political reeducation after the subsequent crackdown on dissidents, and joined the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1991. This culminated in his posting as the consul for political affairs in the Chinese consulate in Sydney, Australia. In this position, Chen has stated that he was responsible for monitoring Chinese political dissidents, especially Falun Gong, living in Australia. He also reportedly had access to highly classified information on Chinese intelligence activities in Australia. Chen has claimed that he had \"gone easy\" on dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners and had not reported some actions, to protest China's policies towards political dissent. He has also suggested that the Chinese government was becoming suspicious of his activities, and that as a result, he fears for his safety if returned to China. Chen remains unapologetic over his defection, insisting that he betrayed the Communist Party of China, not China.\n\nFactors contributing to the defection, according to Chen, are the torture and death of his father during the Cultural Revolution, his witness of the Tiananmen Massacre and the persecution against the Falun Gong imposed by the Chinese Authorities.\n\nOn 26 May 2005, Chen walked out of the consulate with his wife and daughter. On that day he reportedly met an officer from the Department of Immigration who contacted the Chinese consulate to verify Chen's identity. A Senate inquiry later criticized the government for this action, citing Chen's stated concern that such contact would put his life in danger.\nOn 31 May he met with a representative from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Chen has stated that he was told at this meeting that his request for political asylum had been rejected, but that he could apply for a protection visa. The story broke to the international media on 3 June, when Chen contacted \"The Australian\" newspaper, sparking fears of a serious diplomatic incident between the two nations. Anne Plunkett the director of protocol at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with Chen, who alleges that she repeatedly urged him not to defect.\n\nOn 4 June, though he allegedly feared being kidnapped, Chen came out of hiding to address a rally commemorating the 16th anniversary of the deaths in Tiananmen Square. During his speech, he claimed he would \"reveal everything he knows\". He also claimed that the Chinese government had more than a thousand agents in Australia, and that they were responsible for monitoring and kidnapping Chinese nationals back to China. Furthermore, Chen claimed that in one particular case in early 2000, Chinese agents in Sydney had kidnapped a student to force his father, Lan Fu, a former senior Chinese official to return to China.\n\nAfter the June 4th rally, Chen once again went into hiding, having claimed that he was under constant surveillance and in fear of his life. On 5 June, the Chinese embassy released a statement claiming that Chen was due to return home and had invented allegations of wrongdoing in the hope that he would be allowed to stay. The statement was intended to alleviate fears for Chen's safety if he returned to China.\n\nOn 7 June Chen's claims of a thousand-strong spy network were supported by Hao Fengjun, a former police officer with the 6-10 Office, a special security force established to eradicate Falun Gong by whatever means they deem necessary. The Chinese government responded by claiming that documents seized from Hao's home in China had shown that he was a low-level policeman suspected of corruption. Hao's lawyer, Bernard Collaery, attacked the claims, however, arguing that they were \"standard [Chinese] tactics.\" Hao was granted a protection visa by the Australian government in late July 2005.\n\nOn 7 July, a Chinese defector in Canada using the name Han Guangsheng emerged to support Chen and Hao's spying allegations. During his interview on the ABC show \"Lateline\", Han explained \"I do know that the Communist Party of China sent people to collect intelligence information, including Chinese Embassy and Consulate staff. Some of the reporters coming from state Chinese media and visiting scholars are also given special spying tasks to carry out.\" The fifty-two-year-old defector has been denied political asylum and ruled ineligible to remain in Canada, because the federal Immigration and Refugee Board found him a \"willing accomplice\" in prior human rights abuses. This appears consistent with Han's claim that he was in charge of Shenyang's public security and labor camps before his defection. \n\nChina's ambassador in Canberra, Fu Ying, condemned Chen for \"attacking his motherland\" with \"allegations and noise\" for what she claimed was the sole purpose of living in a wealthier country. She warned that many more would follow Chen, if he was allowed to relocate to Australia. \n\nOn 8 July, Chen Yonglin, his wife, and his 6-year-old daughter were granted permanent protection visas by the Immigration Department, despite the opposition of the Chinese government.\n\nFollowing the granting of protection visas to Chen and his family, he has met with Australian intelligence officials to discuss his earlier claims of a thousand-strong Chinese spy network. On 21 July Chen testified before the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations as part of a panel discussing \"Falun Gong and China's Continuing War on Human Rights.\" Here Chen broadened his earlier charges, stating: \"I am aware there are over 1,000 Chinese secret agents and informants in Australia, and the number in the United States should not be less.\" He also testified that \"The United States and Australia are considered by the CPC as the base of the Falun Gong overseas\" and that \"Chinese diplomats are required to denounce the Falun Gong and to distribute anti-Falun Gong materials whenever it is possible.\" \n\nOn 31 July, Chen attended a public seminar hosted by the Victorian Federation of Chinese Associations without invitation. There he defended and repeated his earlier spying allegations, and went on to claim that the VFCA was \"controlled by the Chinese Consulate in Melbourne\". The vice president of the federation, Sheng Wang, denied these claims and accused Chen of damaging the reputation of all Chinese Australians as well as undermining relations between China and Australia. \n\nOn 5 August, Chen was invited to a seminar at the University of Melbourne. \n\nOn 16 August, Chen accused the Chinese government of sending a three-member assassination squad into Australia, claiming he was alerted to their presence by a close friend in the foreign ministry. Chen told ABC TV, \"they want to shut me up and ... they want to send a warning example to others who want to defect.\" Foreign Minister Alexander Downer called this \"highly improbable.\"\n\nIn late September, Chen contended that the man in charge of China's spy network continued to operate out of the consulate-general in Sydney. As reported by \"The Bulletin\", this individual works independently of the consulate, complete with his own budget. Chen did not name this alleged spymaster. \n\nIn October and November, Chen addressed the European Parliament, the Flemish Parliament of Belgium, and the British Parliament on the issue of humans rights in China. The Chinese Mission at the European Parliament sent three diplomats and three official media reporters to hear Chen's testimony at the European Parliament. While Chen was addressing to the British All-Party Parliamentary Group on Human Rights at the Palace of Westminster, President Hu Jintao was visiting Westminster. Prime Minister Tony Blair was forced to raise the human rights issue with Hu under the pressure of overwhelming media attention.\n\nOn 30 March 2006, Chen joined more than 4000 signatories in an open letter to Australian Prime Minister John Howard to question Premier Wen Jiabao regarding the persecution against human rights lawyers in China by the Chinese Authorities and concern about allegations of live organ harvesting at the Shenyang Thrombosis Hospital despite official Chinese denials.\n\n"}

When mentioning the execution of Gallus by orders of Constantius II, Julian lists the several ways the two men were related. \"Constantius gave over to his most inveterate enemies, his own cousin, the Caesar, his sister's husband, the father of his niece, the man whose own sister he had himself married in earlier days\". \n\nGallus was a son of Julius Constantius and his first wife Galla. She is assumed to be a full sister of Gallus. Julius Constantius was a son of Constantius Chlorus and Flavia Maximiana Theodora. He was a paternal half-brother of Constantine I. In 337, Constantine I died. Several of his relatives were killed shortly after his death. Julius Constantius was among them. The \"History of the Arians\" (358) by Athanasius of Alexandria reports on Constantius II having killed his father-in-law. Though Constantius had two later marriages, this is considered a reference to Julius Constantius. \"The common feelings of humanity could not induce him to spare even his own kindred. His uncles he slew; his cousins he put out of the way; he commiserated not the sufferings of his father-in-law, though he had married his daughter, or of his kinsmen\".\n\nA brother is considered to have been assassinated with their father in 337. Julian the Apostate was a younger, paternal half-brother to this Empress.\n\nHer marriage to Constantius seems to be recorded in the Life of Constantine by Eusebius of Caesarea. \"On the completion of the thirtieth year of his [Constantine's] reign he solemnized the marriage of his second son [Constantius II], having concluded that of his first-born long before. This was an occasion of great joy and festivity, the emperor himself attending on his son at the ceremony, and entertaining the guests of both sexes, the men and women in distinct and separate companies, with sumptuous hospitality. Rich presents likewise were liberally distributed among the cities and people.\" The marriage can be estimated to 335 or 336. Constantine I had been declared emperor in 306.\n\nNeither her name nor the time of her death appear in surviving sources. Thomas M. Banchich, a modern historian, points that \"her passing may have facilitated Gallus' fall in 353/4\". The \"Panegyric In Honour Of Eusebia\" by Julian the Apostate places the marriage of Eusebia, second wife of Constantius, prior to the defeat of rival emperor Magnentius. Magnentius was dead by August, 353. The marriage of Constantius and Eusebia may have occurred earlier in the year.\n"}

He is an Immortal. Kronos represents Pestilence, as one of the Four Horsemen.\n\nKronos was the leader of the Four Horsemen. Along with Methos, Silas and Caspian, he spread terror across two continents in the Bronze Age, killing while roaming the land and destroying everything in their way, just for the pleasure of it all. \nIn November 1996, Kronos resurfaced in the city of Seacouver. He tried to reunite his infamous brethren, The Four Horsemen again. The Immortal female Cassandra, a former slave of The Four Horsemen was battling Kronos when Duncan MacLeod came across them. It was then that Duncan MacLeod discovered the dark past of his close friend, the wily and peace-loving Immortal Methos. For centuries, Methos was one of the infamous Four Horsemen. He destroyed, pillaged and plundered a myriad lands across the world, right alongside them.\n\nCassandra and MacLeod decided that all four of them had to be killed, though MacLeod still found it difficult to see his friend as an enemy. The two of them followed a trail laid by Methos to Bordeaux, where they faced the Four Horsemen.\n\nKronos and Caspian were defeated after fierce and drawn-out battles by Duncan MacLeod (who had known Kronos as the vicious killer and outlaw Melvin Koren in the American Old West). The Immortal Methos, who allied himself with Duncan MacLeod, beheaded the violent yet slow-witted Silas, his only true friend among The Four Horsemen. Cassandra then tried to kill Methos, her former captor, but was convinced by MacLeod to let him live.\n\nValentine Pelka's portrayal of the Immortal Kronos as a charismatic, funny and seductive yet evil warrior hellbent on world domination and destruction made him a favorite among \"Highlander\" fans.\n\nThe character Kronos would also appear as an impersonation by the powerful demon Ahriman, a formidable foe of Duncan MacLeod, in the episodes \"Archangel and Armageddon\". He would make one last appearance in the series final episodes, 'To Be/Not To Be', in which a world without Duncan Macleod saw Kronos and Methos re-form The Horsemen, who were at war with James Horton's Hunters, who had seized control of the Watchers from Joe Dawson.\n\nMethos is a fictional character from the \"Highlander\" universe - the film series, the television show \"\", and several fiction books. He is an Immortal. He is portrayed by actor Peter Wingfield in both series and the movies. Methos, as one of the Four Horsemen, represented death.\n\nMethos was first introduced in the \"Highlander\" episode \"Methos\". It was originally planned to have him die at the end of the two-parter “Finale” episode, but the writers saw potential in the character and kept him.\n\n36th century BC\n\n33rd century BC\n\nMethos, when first introduced during Season 3, was portrayed as the \"Oldest of the Immortals”. He claims he is roughly 5000 years + old, the approximate date he took his first head, but admits that “[b]efore that, it all starts to blur.”\n\nAccording to the series, Methos had been keeping journals chronicling his life. Because of these journals, he was considered one of the Watcher Organization's greatest mysteries. His existence was doubted and questioned for many centuries. Methos (under the guise of Watcher Adam Pierson) was assigned to the writings chronicling the legendary Methos' past. These journals documented - with varied accuracy - much of his life. In doing so, he became somewhat of an off-field agent for The Watchers and was able to keep tabs on other Immortals that he preferred to avoid. That changed when two Watchers died at the hand of Kalas, an evil Immortal.\n\nDuring the third season Joe Dawson, Duncan's Watcher and close friend, realized that Kalas was looking for Methos. Joe knew that with Methos's Quickening, Kalas could be unstoppable. Both Kalas and MacLeod raced to be the first to find Methos. Duncan's search led him to seek out the Watcher known as \"Adam Pierson.\" When they first met, Duncan immediately sensed that Adam was an Immortal. Through his conversation with Adam, MacLeod realized that Adam was Methos. Duncan eventually killed Kalas on top of the Eiffel Tower in the season's finale. Methos and Duncan become friends.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Methos rode alongside three other immortals: Silas, Caspian, and Kronos, who were known as The Four Horsemen and who had plundered and raped across villages on two continents. Kronos tracked down Methos in order to get to MacLeod.\n\nCassandra, an Immortal love interest of Duncan's and who was also tracking Kronos, pointed out to Duncan that Methos was actually Death. She claimed he had enslaved her after destroying her village thousands of years ago.\n\nMethos decided to flee, but Duncan caught him before he left. When asked whether Cassandra's accusations were true, Methos responded:\n\nIn that moment, Duncan decided to put an end to their friendship. Methos persuaded Kronos to put the band together again since he knew where both Caspian and Silas were. Kronos took the opportunity, relishing the idea of world domination again. In the end, Methos allied himself with Duncan MacLeod to destroy the Horsemen. The two defeated Kronos and Silas together in the same area, resulting in a powerful Double Quickening. Their friendship, however, still remained strained.\n\nMethos returned again in Season 6, the last season for the television series. During the episode \"Indiscretions\", he learns he's being chased by an obsessive Immortal named Morgan Walker. Walker hated him for having had an affair with his slave 200 years ago. Methos, trying to hide from Walker who had tracked him down, looked for information in the Watchers' computer database. Joe Dawson was angry when he found out that Methos was only trying to save his own life by hacking into Joe's files, instead of explaining his whereabouts one year earlier. Although Joe and Methos' friendship was shaky, together they helped rescue a rookie Watcher and also Joe's illegitimate daughter, Amy Thomas. Their adventure helped them to rekindle their friendship and Methos was able to defeat Walker.\n\nDuring the series finale, Duncan MacLeod was thrown into another reality where he had never been born. In this reality, Methos had a lover named Jillian, who was killed by The Watchers (who were trying to kill him). He survived their attack due to Kronos saving him. The event made him swear revenge to all the Watchers. He gathered together the Four Horsemen and also Richie Ryan, but the Watchers killed Silas and Caspian. Methos later killed Richie, who couldn't bring himself to kill Joe Dawson on Methos's orders. Duncan MacLeod saw this with the help of Hugh Fitzcairn's spirit, and tried to stop all of it. He fought Methos and killed him in revenge for Richie's death. In the same instant that Duncan executed the killing stroke, he returned to his original reality, where Methos tried to wake him up. In the end, it was the advice of Methos that put Duncan MacLeod back into The Game once more.\n\nAccording to the book \"\", he was born in ancient Egypt and was the second son of three boys and two girls, making him one of the few ancient immortals not known to be a foundling. When he was approximately 35 years old, the oasis at which his family lived ran dry. He had accompanied his family as they traveled to another oasis and experienced his first death when a sandstorm trapped them before they reached their destination. A Bedouin tribe found him and housed him for a while, teaching him the ways of survival in the desert. He stayed with them for many years, until it was evident that he wasn't aging. By the time he was an estimated 603 years old, he began to meet others that were like him. He then realized that there were many Immortals besides himself. He learned some facts of immortality from Menahem, an Immortal whom Methos considered ancient at the time. It was also during this time in his life that he took his first head, from another immortal named Joseph.\n\nDuring time he spent in ancient Egypt an Immortal pharaoh named Djer took him under his wing. Methos soon learned that the Pharaoh had his nomad wife killed during a smiting of Sinai (the killing of all nomads). Angered at Djer, Methos buried him alive inside a sarcophagus deep within a tomb. He claimed Djer's throne and became Pharaoh of Egypt.\n\nMethos is portrayed as having a dry sense of humor, a pessimistic view on life, a witty repartee, and a somewhat loyal devotion to his friends. He's also very untrusting of people, has been accused by others as putting himself first, as being arrogant, and as being manipulative. When in conversations with both Duncan and Richie, his manner is often comparable to that of a sarcastic old man (who hasn't managed to die yet), with his tendency to be right being rather annoying to his friends. Ironically, Methos looks younger than most Immortals in the series, being physically stuck at ca. 25-35, causing his mannerisms to clash with his appearance. He has also the habit of saying \"yes\" after each sentence if he wants to emphasize whatever he is saying right now. Methos is a method actor, being able to completely become whatever identity he has taken on at the time, but is able to switch to a far darker tone within a moment, surprising most people, and making them unsure of what to think of the \"old man\".\n\nMethos avoids battle and, for the most part, other Immortals whenever possible. In tune with this, it is hardly surprising that his Ivanhoe-style sword was quite subdued, simply serving the purpose of keeping him alive. He sleeps with his sword under his bed and sometimes carries a handgun. He rarely participated in The Game (his preference was to observe rather than fight), preferring to remain a legend so few would come looking for him. Whenever he perceived that there was a great danger nearby, he had a habit of suddenly disappearing for a while. However, even though he preferred to stay in the shadows, he could still defend himself when needed, and with time, his admittedly rusty skills would come back to life. In combat, he showed a deviousness and ruthlessness unmatched by most of his associates not considered evil, using underhanded tactics to win, such as a surprise attack with an additional dagger while locking his opponent's blade in defense.\n\nHe considered opera music to be boring and he liked Bruce Springsteen, Queen, and other music as well. He collected things, mostly antiques that many people considered to be junk, claiming that he thought some of the \"junk\" could be his from the past. He has also commented that although he knew most of everything in life, he was a bit weak in pop-cultural matters.\n\nMethos often used the name \"Adam\" in some way in most of his aliases (likely a reference to the Biblical Adam and his extreme age). In the early 19th century, one of his aliases was “Benjamin Adams.” He was also known as “Ben Adams” when he moved to Arizona around 1860. Between 1980 and 1996 he was known as “Adam Pierson.” He also made rather frequent jokes and references to his age; Duncan and Joe often simply called him \"Old Man\". He is one of the few immortals who count their lifetimes in millennia, instead of centuries.\n\nWhen an impostor calling himself Methos appeared he thought it was flattering, and was happy to let someone else be hunted for a while.\n\nAccording to the episode “One Minute To Midnight” he majored in medicine at the University of Heidelberg in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1453.\n\nHe claims to have studied at the University of Paris, majoring in classical studies.\n\nMethos claims to have met Helen of Troy, Socrates, Julius Caesar, Jesus, and Cleopatra. He knew the English poets Byron and Percy Shelley, the English author Mary Shelley, and rode with Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid. In his first meeting with MacLeod, he said not many people can claim to have been on the same stage as both Julius Caesar and The Rolling Stones.\n\nHe's also been married 68 times, but never to an Immortal. According to him, it would be too much of a commitment.\n\nHe fell in love with a mortal named Alexa Bond, a waitress who worked in Joe's bar, and who was terminally ill. Their relationship spanned three episodes (\"Timeless\", “Deliverance”, and \"Methuselah's Gift\") as well as multiple chapters (entitled:“Postcards From Alexa”) in the book \"\".\n\nAt first, Alexa refused his proposition of dating, because she didn't want to disappoint him as she was dying. However, Methos was persistent, and waited for her under the rain and asked her out on a date. He mentioned to Alexa that the reason for asking her on a date was \"[b]ecause the alternative is unthinkable.\" In his quest to make her feel alive even though she was dying, he wanted to make her dream come true by traveling the world.\n\nDuring their travels, Alexa became gravely ill. Methos wanted to use the Methuselah's Stone, rumored to be able to make a person Immortal, to save Alexa. He tried to steal it, with help from Amanda. Methos failed to retrieve the stone due to the intervention of the Watchers. Methos remained at Alexa's side until she died of her illness. It was her strength that taught Methos' humanity's will to live despite the fact they would ultimately die. She was the person that opened his eyes, at the same time, cursed at the fact that with the power of immortality, he would have to live with the fact that he must watch her suffer and die. A thing that Duncan knows too well.\n\nAmanda and Methos had similar personalities in the series. Both are shown to be cunning, to think of themselves as a priority, and both remain loyal to their friends. When Amanda was captured by a nemesis of Duncan MacLeod's, Methos offered to help, saying he was “...fond of the little vixen [him]self.”\n\nShe seemed to know Methos from earlier times and she also helped him when he tried to steal the Methuselah crystal. When he failed, Amanda gave him a heartfelt hug and words of encouragement.\n\nMethos believes very strongly in Duncan MacLeod going so far as to offer him his head to defeat an evil Immortal. He often refers to MacLeod as a “Boy Scout” and tries to keep him out of trouble as much as possible. Often, Methos will take on the opposite view of Duncan about situations, appearing to play devil's advocate. Although at times this quirk rubbed Duncan the wrong way, their friendship still remained relatively strong during the series and into the movies (even despite the events of “Comes A Horseman” and “”), as Duncan often seeks out Methos for help and guidance.\n\nNothing is known of his Watcher assignments, indeed, considering that he stayed \"among\" them for at least 200 years and being sought for likely even longer, it is presumable that he next-to-never had a watcher.<br>\nDuring his time staying with the Watchers, he was essentially his own Watcher, tasked with locating himself (and thus preventing this altogether).\n\nSometime during his life, when realizing that for being the oldest Immortal, he was a primary target for all the other Immortals, he removed himself from The Game. He hid within The Watchers, where he was put in charge of locating himself, essentially making himself his own watcher. When Duncan MacLeod meets him in 1995, Methos had not taken a head for roughly 200 years; however, his sword skills were not diminished, although he admitted to be a little rusty, and later on also admitting he lacked the fire/passion to continue fighting at all.\n\n\"1\" - Unknown, c. 3000 BC\n\n\"2\" - Joseph, c. 2400 BC\n\n\"3\" - Kristin Gilles, 1995\n\n\"4\" - Silas, 1997\n\n\"5\" - Morgan Walker, 1998\n\n\"6\" - Prince Khyan, 1999\n\n\"7\" - Unknown Immortal, 2008 Reunion Special.\n\nMovies - \"\", \"\"\n\nEpisodes - \"Methos,\" \"Finalé, Part 1,\" \"Finalé, Part 2,\" \"Chivalry,\" \"Timeless,\" \"Deliverance,\" \"Methuselah's Gift,\" \"Through A Glass, Darkly,\" \"Till Death,\" \"Judgement Day,\" \"One Minute to Midnight,\" \"The Messenger,\" \"The Valkyrie,\" \"Comes a Horseman,\" \",\" \"Forgive Us Our Trespasses,\" \"The Modern Prometheus,\" \"Archangel,\" \"Indiscretions,\" \"To Be...,\" \"...Not To Be\"\n\nAnimated Flash Series - \"The Methos Chronicles\"\n\nBooks - \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"\n\nSilas is a fictional character from \"\", portrayed by actor Richard Ridings. He is an Immortal. Silas represents war as one of the Four Horsemen.\n\nSilas was an Immortal known for great evil as a member of \"The Four Horsemen\"; a group of Immortals who raped and killed across two continents during the Bronze Age. The gruff-voiced Silas loves to do nothing more than kill, especially with the battle axe he wields. The Four Horseman came across a village where pre-Immortal Cassandra lived. The Four Horsemen killed everyone in her village. Silas and the others took trophies of their kills. Silas and Caspian were fighting over a blanket. Kronos, the leader of the Horsemen used his sword to split the blanket in two. Silas was good friends with fellow Horseman, Methos.\n\nSilas then lived in Ukraine, hiding in the woods for many centuries. In November 1996, he was chopping wood one day and sensed the presence of other Immortals: Kronos and Methos. The Four Horsemen are united after they got Caspian out of an insane asylum. They went to an abandoned submarine base in Bordeaux, France. Silas didn't realise how much times had changed, however, still wanting to ride on horseback to kill. Kronos makes plans to rule the world by developing a virus. Silas wanted one of the monkeys in the cage as a pet. Later on, Kronos sent Silas and Caspian to deal with Duncan MacLeod. Duncan beheaded Caspian and escaped while Silas returned to their hideout. Duncan goes there to rescue Cassandra, captured by the Horsemen. Duncan ends up fighting Kronos, and Silas goes to behead Cassandra, but Methos stops Silas and fights him. Silas is beheaded by Methos at the same time Duncan beheads Kronos. Duncan and Methos receive a Double Quickening. Methos is grief-stricken for what he had done as he saw Silas the closest thing to a brother.\n\nCaspian is a fictional character from \"\", portrayed by actor Marcus Testory. Caspian represents famine, as one of the Four Horsemen.\n\nAn immortal, Caspian was born sometime in the 13th century BC. He was a member of the Four Horsemen, a group of mounted riders who terrorized, killed, and burned villages in two continents during the Bronze Age. He and fellow member Silas were always fighting. When they raided the village where Cassandra lived, Caspian and Silas fought over a blanket. Kronos, the leader of the Four Horsemen, ended up splitting the blanket so they could each have part of it.\n\nCenturies after his stint in the Four Horsemen, Caspian, under the alias Evan Caspari, became a serial killer in Romania. No one knows how many people he killed; he kept body parts in his basement, garden and his freezer. Caspian was arrested and sent to an asylum for the criminally insane outside of Bucharest, Romania where he was kept chained in a cell. Years later, in November 1996, Kronos attempted to reunite the Four Horsemen. Kronos, Methos, and Silas visited the asylum, where Kronos bribed the doctor to see Caspian. Caspian killed the doctor and so the Four Horsemen reunited. They went to an abandoned submarine base in Bordeaux, France where they hid out. Kronos lays out his plan to rule the world, but Caspian is more anxious to kill.\n\nA couple of days later, the Horsemen capture Cassandra from the hotel where she and Duncan MacLeod were staying while Duncan was visiting Methos on holy ground. Caspian and Silas, sent by Kronos to kill him, end up fighting MacLeod on a bridge. Caspian is killed, and before Silas can exact revenge, MacLeod escapes, jumping off the bridge while receiving the Quickening.\n\nAs \"Famine,\" he has the propensity to consume living animals and possibly his victims. He eats a living roach in his cell at the asylum. He wants to eat one of the animals Kronos has caged at the submarine base (to Silas' protest). He threatens to cannibalize Duncan MacLeod at the beginning of their fight. Although not specifically stated in the show, these behaviors indicate that he possibly ate parts of his human victims, both as a serial killer in modern times and as one of the Horseman in the Bronze Age.\n\nEpisodes - \"Comes a Horseman\", \"\"\n\n"}

The native name of the Gin, Kinh, simply means Vietnamese people and the Chinese character for the ethnic group, 京, is the same as in Sino-Vietnamese. They mainly live on three islands off the coast of Dongxing, Fangchenggang, in the Chinese autonomous region of Guangxi.\n\nThe Gin population was estimated to be just over 28,000 as of 2010. This number does not include the 36,205 Vietnamese nationals studying or working in Mainland China recorded by the 2010 national population census.\n\nThe ancestors of the Gin people immigrated to southern China from Vietnam during the 16th century and established communities on the three originally uninhabited islands of Wutou, Wanwei and Shanxin.\n\nThe people of this very small ethnic minority have lived for about 500 years on the three islands of Wanwei, Wutou and Shanxin off the coast of Guangxi, China, about 8km east of the border with Vietnam.\nIn the 1960s, the islands were connected to the mainland by a land reclamation project.\nThe islands are administered as part of Dongxing county within Fangchenggang prefecture.\nA minority also live in nearby counties and towns with predominately Han Chinese or Zhuang populations.\n\nThe Gin live in a subtropical area with plenty of rainfall and rich mineral resources. The Beibu Gulf to its south is an ideal fishing ground. Of the more than 700 species of fish found there, over 200 are of great economic value and high yields. Pearls, sea horses and sea otters which grow in abundance are prized for their medicinal value. Seawater from the Beibu Gulf is good for salt making. The main crops there are rice, sweet potato, peanut, taro and millet, and sub-tropical fruits like papaya, banana, and longan are also plentiful. Mineral deposits include iron, monazite, titanium, magnetite and silica. The large tracts of mangroves growing in marshy land along the coast are a rich source of tannin, an essential raw material for the tanning industry.\n\nThe language of the Gin people is a Yue dialect. Standard Cantonese is also spoken by many in the community as well as Mandarin Chinese. A survey in 1980 indicated that one third of Gin people had lost their native language and can only speak Cantonese or Mandarin, and another third who are bilingual in the Gin and Han Chinese languages. The survey suggested a decline in the use of the Gin language, but in the 2000s, there appeared to be a revival in the use of the language.\n\nIn addition to using Hanzi, the Gin have their unique Zinan script, referred to as Chu Nom in Vietnamese, which is similar to the Zhuang old script. Created on the basis of the script of the Han people towards the end of the 13th century, it is found in old song books and religious scriptures. Most Gin read and write in the Han script because they have lived with Hans for a long time.\n\nGin people like antiphonal songs which are melodious and lyrical. Their traditional instruments include the two-stringed fiddle, flute, drum, gong and the single-stringed fiddle, a unique musical instrument of the ethnic group. Folk stories and legends abound. Their favorite dances feature lanterns, fancy colored sticks, embroidery and dragons.\nGin costume is simple and practical. Traditionally, women wear tight-fitting, collarless short blouses buttoned in front plus a diamond-shaped top apron and broad black or brown trousers. When going out, they would put on a light colored gown with narrow sleeves. They also like earrings. Men wear long jackets reaching down to the knees and girdles. Now most people dress themselves like their Han neighbors though a few elderly women retain their tradition and a few young women coil their hair and dye their teeth black. \n\nMany Gin are believers of Buddhism or Taoism, with a few followers of Catholicism. They also celebrate the Lunar New Year, the Pure Brightness Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival like the Han. \n\nFish sauce is a favorite condiment of the Gin people for cooking, and a cake prepared with glutinous rice mixed with sesame is a great delicacy for them. \nThere used to be some taboos, such as stepping over a fishing net placed on the beach.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "184030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184030", "title": "Idries Shah", "text": "Idries Shah\n\nIdries Shah (; , ; 16 June 1924 – 23 November 1996), also known as Idris Shah, né Sayed Idries el-Hashimi (Arabic: سيد إدريس هاشمي) and by the pen name Arkon Daraul, was an author and teacher in the Sufi tradition who wrote over three dozen books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and culture studies.\n\nBorn in India, the descendant of a family of Afghan nobles, Shah grew up mainly in England. His early writings centred on magic and witchcraft. In 1960 he established a publishing house, Octagon Press, producing translations of Sufi classics as well as titles of his own. His seminal work was \"The Sufis\", which appeared in 1964 and was well received internationally. In 1965, Shah founded the Institute for Cultural Research, a London-based educational charity devoted to the study of human behaviour and culture. A similar organisation, the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK), exists in the United States, under the directorship of Stanford University psychology professor Robert Ornstein, whom Shah appointed as his deputy in the U.S.\n\nIn his writings, Shah presented Sufism as a universal form of wisdom that predated Islam. Emphasizing that Sufism was not static but always adapted itself to the current time, place and people, he framed his teaching in Western psychological terms. Shah made extensive use of traditional teaching stories and parables, texts that contained multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and self-reflection in the reader. He is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous Mulla Nasrudin stories.\n\nShah was at times criticized by orientalists who questioned his credentials and background. His role in the controversy surrounding a new translation of the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\", published by his friend Robert Graves and his older brother Omar Ali-Shah, came in for particular scrutiny. However, he also had many notable defenders, chief among them the novelist Doris Lessing. Shah came to be recognized as a spokesman for Sufism in the West and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of Western universities. His works have played a significant part in presenting Sufism as a form of spiritual wisdom approachable by individuals and not necessarily attached to any specific religion.\n\nIdries Shah was born in Simla, India, to an Afghan-Indian father, Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, a writer and diplomat, and a Scottish mother, Saira Elizabeth Luiza Shah. His family on the paternal side were Musavi Sayyids. Their ancestral home was near the Paghman Gardens of Kabul. His paternal grandfather, Sayed Amjad Ali Shah, was the \"nawab\" of Sardhana in the North-Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, a hereditary title the family had gained thanks to the services an earlier ancestor, Jan-Fishan Khan, had rendered to the British.\n\nShah mainly grew up in the vicinity of London. According to L. F. Rushbrook Williams, Shah began accompanying his father in his travels from a very young age, and although they both travelled widely and often, they always returned to England where the family made their home for many years. Through these travels, which were often part of Ikbal Ali Shah's Sufi work, Shah was able to meet and spend time with prominent statesmen and distinguished personalities in both East and West. Williams writes,\nSuch an upbringing presented to a young man of marked intelligence, such as Idries Shah soon proved himself to possess, many opportunities to acquire a truly international outlook, a broad vision, and an acquaintance with people and places that any professional diplomat of more advanced age and longer experience might well envy. But a career of diplomacy did not attract Idries Shah...\n\nShah described his own unconventional upbringing in a 1971 BBC interview with Pat Williams. He described how his father and his extended family and friends always tried to expose the children to a \"multiplicity of impacts\" and a wide range of contacts and experiences with the intention of producing a well-rounded person. Shah described this as \"the Sufi approach\" to education.\n\nAfter his family moved from London to Oxford in 1940 to escape The Blitz (German bombing), he spent two or three years at the City of Oxford High School for Boys. In 1945, he accompanied his father to Uruguay as secretary to his father's \"halal\" meat mission. He returned to England in October 1946, following allegations of improper business dealings.\n\nShah married the Parsi Cynthia (Kashfi) Kabraji in 1958; they had a daughter, Saira, in 1964, followed by twins – a son, Tahir, and another daughter, Safia – in 1966.\n\nTowards the end of the 1950s, Shah established contact with Wiccan circles in London and then acted as a secretary and companion to Gerald Gardner, the founder of modern Wicca, for some time. In those days, Shah used to hold court for anyone interested in Sufism at a table in the Cosmo restaurant in Swiss Cottage (North London) every Tuesday evening.\n\nIn 1960, Shah founded his publishing house, Octagon Press; one of its first titles was Gardner's biography – \"Gerald Gardner, Witch\". The book was attributed to one of Gardner's followers, Jack L. Bracelin, but had in fact been written by Shah.\n\nAccording to Wiccan Frederic Lamond, Bracelin's name was used because Shah \"did not want to confuse his Sufi students by being seen to take an interest in another esoteric tradition.\" Lamond said that Shah seemed to have become somewhat disillusioned with Gardner, and had told him one day, when he was visiting for tea:When I was interviewing Gerald, I sometimes wished I was a \"News of the World\" reporter. What marvellous material for an exposé! And yet I have it on good authority that this group will be the cornerstone of the religion of the coming age. But rationally, rationally I can't see it!\n\nIn January 1961, while on a trip to Mallorca with Gardner, Shah met the English poet Robert Graves. Shah wrote to Graves from his \"pension\" in Palma, requesting an opportunity of \"saluting you one day before very long\". He added that he was currently researching ecstatic religions, and that he had been \"attending... experiments conducted by the witches in Britain, into mushroom-eating and so on\" – a topic that had been of interest to Graves for some time.\n\nShah also told Graves that he was \"intensely preoccupied at the moment with the carrying forward of ecstatic and intuitive knowledge.\" Graves and Shah soon became close friends and confidants. Graves took a supportive interest in Shah's writing career and encouraged him to publish an authoritative treatment of Sufism for a Western readership, along with the practical means for its study; this was to become \"The Sufis\". Shah managed to obtain a substantial advance on the book, resolving temporary financial difficulties.\n\nIn 1964, \"The Sufis\" appeared, published by Doubleday, with a long introduction by Robert Graves. The book chronicles the impact of Sufism on the development of Western civilisation and traditions from the seventh century onward through the work of such figures as Roger Bacon, John of the Cross, Raymond Lully, Chaucer and others, and has become a classic. Like Shah's other books on the topic, \"The Sufis\" was conspicuous for avoiding terminology that might have identified his interpretation of Sufism with traditional Islam.\n\nThe book also employed a deliberately \"scattered\" style; Shah wrote to Graves that its aim was to \"de-condition people, and prevent their reconditioning\"; had it been otherwise, he might have used a more conventional form of exposition. The book sold poorly at first, and Shah invested a considerable amount of his own money in advertising it. Graves told him not to worry; even though he had some misgivings about the writing, and was hurt that Shah had not allowed him to proofread it before publication, he said he was \"so proud in having assisted in its publication\", and assured Shah that it was \"a marvellous book, and will be recognised as such before long. Leave it to find its own readers who will hear your voice spreading, not those envisaged by Doubleday.\"\n\nIn June 1962, a couple of years prior to the publication of \"The Sufis\", Shah had also established contact with members of the movement that had formed around the mystical teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. A press article had appeared, describing the author's visit to a secret monastery in Central Asia, where methods strikingly similar to Gurdjieff's methods were apparently being taught. The otherwise unattested monastery had, it was implied, a representative in England.\n\nOne of Ouspensky's earliest pupils, Reggie Hoare, who had been part of the Gurdjieff work since 1924, made contact with Shah through that article. Hoare \"attached special significance to what Shah had told him about the Enneagram symbol and said that Shah had revealed secrets about it that went far beyond what we had heard from Ouspensky.\" Through Hoare, Shah was introduced to other Gurdjieffians, including John G. Bennett, a noted Gurdjieff student and founder of an \"Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences\" located at Coombe Springs, a estate in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey.\n\nAt that time, Bennett had already investigated the Sufi origins of many of Gurdjieff's teachings, based on both Gurdjieff's own numerous statements, and on travels Bennett himself made in the East where he met various Sufi Sheikhs. He was convinced that Gurdjieff had adopted many of the ideas and techniques of the Sufis and that, for those who heard Gurdjieff's lectures in the early 1920s, \"the Sufi origin of his teaching was unmistakable to anyone who had studied both.\"\n\nBennett wrote about his first meeting with Shah in his autobiography \"Witness\" (1974):At first, I was wary. I had just decided to go forward on my own and now another 'teacher' had appeared. One or two conversations with Reggie convinced me that I ought at least to see for myself. Elizabeth and I went to dinner with the Hoares to meet Shah, who turned out to be a young man in his early 40s. He spoke impeccable English and but for his beard and some of his gestures might well have been taken for an English public school type. Our first impressions were unfavourable. He was restless, smoked incessantly and seemed too intent on making a good impression. Halfway through the evening, our attitude completely changed. We recognized that he was not only an unusually gifted man, but that he had the indefinable something that marks the man who has worked seriously upon himself... Knowing Reggie to be a very cautious man, trained moreover in assessing information by many years in the Intelligence Service, I accepted his assurances and also his belief that Shah had a very important mission in the West that we ought to help him to accomplish.\n\nShah gave Bennett a \"Declaration of the People of the Tradition\" and authorised him to share this with other Gurdjieffians. The document announced that there was now an opportunity for the transmission of \"a secret, hidden, special, superior form of knowledge\"; combined with the personal impression Bennett formed of Shah, it convinced Bennett that Shah was a genuine emissary of the \"Sarmoung Monastery\" in Afghanistan, an inner circle of Sufis whose teachings had inspired Gurdjieff.\n\nFor the next few years, Bennett and Shah had weekly private talks that lasted for hours. Later, Shah also gave talks to the students at Coombe Springs. Bennett says that Shah's plans included \"reaching people who occupied positions of authority and power who were already half-consciously aware that the problems of mankind could no longer be solved by economic, political or social action. Such people were touched, he said, by the new forces moving in the world to help mankind to survive the coming crisis.\"\n\nBennett agreed with these ideas and also agreed that \"people attracted by overtly spiritual or esoteric movements seldom possessed the qualities needed to reach and occupy positions of authority\" and that \"there were sufficient grounds for believing that throughout the world there were already people occupying important positions, who were capable of looking beyond the limitations of nationality and cultures and who could see for themselves that the only hope for mankind lies in the intervention of a Higher Source.\"\n\nBennett wrote, \"I had seen enough of Shah to know that he was no charlatan or idle boaster and that he was intensely serious about the task he had been given.\" Wishing to support Shah's work, Bennett decided in 1965, after agonising for a long time and discussing the matter with the council and members of his Institute, to give the Coombe Springs property to Shah, who had insisted that any such gift must be made with no strings attached. Once the property was transferred to Shah, he banned Bennett's associates from visiting, and made Bennett himself feel unwelcome.\n\nBennett says he did receive an invitation to the \"Midsummer Revels\", a party Shah held at Coombe Springs that lasted two days and two nights, primarily for the young people whom Shah was then attracting. Anthony Blake, who worked with Bennett for 15 years, says, \"When Idries Shah acquired Coombe Springs, his main activity was giving parties. I had only a few encounters with him but much enjoyed his irreverent attitude. Bennett once said to me, 'There are different styles in the work. Mine is like Gurdjieff's, around struggle with one's denial. But Shah's way is to treat the work as a joke.'\"\n\nAfter a few months, Shah sold the plot – worth more than £100,000 – to a developer and used the proceeds to establish himself and his work activities at Langton House in Langton Green, near Tunbridge Wells, a 50-acre estate that once belonged to the family of Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts.\n\nAlong with the Coombe Springs property, Bennett also handed the care of his body of pupils to Shah, comprising some 300 people. Shah promised he would integrate all those who were suitable; about half of their number found a place in Shah's work. Some 20 years later, the Gurdjieffian author James Moore suggested that Bennett had been duped by Shah. Bennett gave an account of the matter himself in his autobiography (1974); he said that Shah's behaviour after the transfer of the property was \"hard to bear\", but also insisted that Shah was a \"man of exquisite manners and delicate sensibilities\" and considered that Shah might have adopted his behaviour deliberately, \"to make sure that all bonds with Coombe Springs were severed\". He added that Langton Green was a far more suitable place for Shah's work than Coombe Springs could have been and said he felt no sadness that Coombe Springs lost its identity; he concluded his account of the matter by stating that he had \"gained freedom\" through his contact with Shah, and had learned \"to love people whom [he] could not understand\".\n\nAccording to Bennett, Shah later also engaged in discussions with the heads of the Gurdjieff groups in New York. In a letter to Paul Anderson from 5 March 1968, Bennett wrote, \"Madame de Salzmann and all the others... are aware of their own limitations and do no more than they are able to do. While I was in New York, Elizabeth and I visited the Foundation, and we saw most of the leading people in the New York group as well as Jeanne de Salzmann herself. Something is preparing, but whether it will come to fruition I cannot tell. I refer to their connection with Idries Shah and his capacity for turning everything upside down. It is useless with such people to be passive, and it is useless to avoid the issue. For the time being, we can only hope that some good will come, and meanwhile continue our own work...\"\n\nThe author and clinical psychologist Kathleen Speeth later wrote,\n\nWitnessing the growing conservatism within the [Gurdjieff] Foundation, John Bennett hoped new blood and leadership would come from elsewhere... Although there may have been flirtation with Shah, nothing came of it. The prevailing sense [among the leaders of the Gurdjieff work] that nothing must change, that a treasure in their safekeeping must at all costs be preserved in its original form, was stronger than any wish for a new wave of inspiration.\"\n\nIn 1965, Shah founded the Society for Understanding Fundamental Ideas (SUFI), later renamed The Institute for Cultural Research (ICR) – an educational charity aimed at stimulating \"study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture\". He also established the Society for Sufi Studies (SSS).\n\nLangton House at Langton Green became a place of gathering and discussion for poets, philosophers and statesmen from around the world, and an established part of the literary scene of the time. The ICR held meetings and gave lectures there, awarding fellowships to international scholars including Sir John Glubb, Aquila Berlas Kiani, Richard Gregory and Robert Cecil, the head of European studies at the University of Reading who became Chairman of the Institute in the early 1970s.\n\nShah was an early member and supporter of the Club of Rome, and several presentations were given to the Institute by scientists like Alexander King.\n\nOther visitors, pupils, and would-be pupils included the poet Ted Hughes, novelists J. D. Salinger, Alan Sillitoe and Doris Lessing, zoologist Desmond Morris, and psychologist Robert Ornstein. The interior of the house was decorated in a Middle-Eastern fashion, and buffet lunches were held every Sunday for guests in a large dining room that was once the estate stable, nicknamed \"The Elephant\" (a reference to the Eastern tale of the \"Elephant in the Dark\").\n\nOver the following years, Shah developed Octagon Press as a means of publishing and distributing reprints of translations of numerous Sufi classics. In addition, he collected, translated and wrote thousands of Sufi tales, making these available to a Western audience through his books and lectures. Several of Shah's books feature the Mullah Nasruddin character, sometimes with illustrations provided by Richard Williams. In Shah's interpretation, the Mulla Nasruddin stories, previously considered a folkloric part of Muslim cultures, were presented as Sufi parables. \n\nNasruddin was featured in Shah's television documentary \"Dreamwalkers\", which aired on the BBC in 1970. Segments included Richard Williams being interviewed about his unfinished animated film about Nasruddin, and scientist John Kermisch discussing the use of Nasruddin stories at the Rand Corporation Think Tank. Other guests included the British psychiatrist William Sargant discussing the hampering effects of brainwashing and social conditioning on creativity and problem-solving, and the comedian Marty Feldman talking with Shah about the role of humour and ritual in human life. The program ended with Shah asserting that humanity could further its own evolution by \"breaking psychological limitations\" but that there was a \"constant accretion of pessimism which effectively prevents evolution in this form from going ahead... Man is asleep – must he die before he wakes up?\"\n\nShah also organised Sufi study groups in the United States. Claudio Naranjo, a Chilean psychiatrist who was teaching in California in the late 1960s, says that, after being \"disappointed in the extent to which Gurdjieff's school entailed a living lineage\", he had turned towards Sufism and had \"become part of a group under the guidance of Idries Shah.\" Naranjo co-wrote a book with Robert Ornstein, entitled \"On The Psychology of Meditation\" (1971). Both of them were associated with the University of California, where Ornstein was a research psychologist at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute.\n\nOrnstein was also president and founder of the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge, established in 1969; seeing a need in the U.S. for books and collections on ancient and new ways of thinking, he formed the ISHK Book Service in 1972 as a central source for important contemporary and traditional literature, becoming the sole U.S. distributor of the works of Idries Shah published by Octagon Press.\n\nAnother Shah associate, the scientist and professor Leonard Lewin, who was teaching telecommunications at the University of Colorado at the time, set up Sufi study groups and other enterprises for the promotion of Sufi ideas like the Institute for Research on the Dissemination of Human Knowledge (IRDHK), and also edited an anthology of writings by and about Shah entitled \"The Diffusion of Sufi Ideas in the West\" (1972).\n\nThe planned animated feature film by Williams, provisionally titled \"The Amazing Nasruddin\", never materialised, as the relationship between Williams and the Shah family soured in 1972 amid disputes about copyrights and funds; however, Williams later used some of the ideas for his film \"The Thief and the Cobbler\".\n\nShah wrote around two dozen more books over the following decades, many of them drawing on classical Sufi sources. Achieving a huge worldwide circulation, his writings appealed primarily to an intellectually oriented Western audience. By translating Sufi teachings into contemporary psychological language, he presented them in vernacular and hence accessible terms. His folktales, illustrating Sufi wisdom through anecdote and example, proved particularly popular. Shah received and accepted invitations to lecture as a visiting professor at academic institutions including the University of California, the University of Geneva, the National University of La Plata and various English universities. Besides his literary and educational work, he found time to design an air ioniser (forming a company together with Coppy Laws) and run a number of textile, ceramics and electronics companies. He also undertook several journeys to his ancestral Afghanistan and involved himself in setting up relief efforts there; he drew on these experiences later on in his book \"Kara Kush\", a novel about the Soviet–Afghan War.\n\nIn late spring of 1987, about a year after his final visit to Afghanistan, Shah suffered two successive and massive heart attacks. He was told that he had only eight per cent of his heart function left, and could not expect to survive. Despite intermittent bouts of illness, he continued working and produced further books over the next nine years.\n\nIdries Shah died in London on 23 November 1996, at the age of 72 and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery. According to his obituary in \"The Daily Telegraph\", Idries Shah was a collaborator with Mujahideen in the Soviet–Afghan War, a Director of Studies for the Institute for Cultural Research and a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables. He was also a member of the Athenaeum Club. At the time of his death, Shah's books had sold over 15 million copies in a dozen languages worldwide, and had been reviewed in numerous international journals and newspapers.\n\nShah's early books were studies of what he called \"minority beliefs\". His first book \"Oriental Magic\", published in 1956, was originally intended to be titled \"Considerations in Eastern and African Minority Beliefs\". He followed this in 1957 with \"The Secret Lore of Magic: Book of the Sorcerers\", originally entitled \"Some Materials on European Minority-Belief Literature\". The names of these books were, according to a contributor to a 1973 \"festschrift\" for Shah, changed before publication due to the \"exigencies of commercial publishing practices.\"\n\nBefore his death in 1969, Shah's father asserted that the reason why he and his son had published books on the subject of magic and the occult was \"to forestall a probable popular revival or belief among a significant number of people in this nonsense. My son... eventually completed this task, when he researched for several years and published two important books on the subject.\"\n\nIn an interview in \"Psychology Today\" from 1975, Shah elaborated:The main purpose of my books on magic was to make this material available to the general reader. For too long people believed that there were secret books, hidden places, and amazing things. They held onto this information as something to frighten themselves with. So the first purpose was information. This is the magic of East and West. That's all. There is no more. The second purpose of those books was to show that there do seem to be forces, some of which are either rationalized by this magic or may be developed from it, which do not come within customary physics or within the experience of ordinary people. I think this should be studied, that we should gather the data and analyze the phenomena. We need to separate the chemistry of magic from the alchemy, as it were.\n\nShah went on to say that his books on the subject were not written for the current devotees of magic and witchcraft, and that in fact he subsequently had to avoid them, as they would only be disappointed in what he had to say.\n\nThese books were followed by the publication of the travelogue \"Destination Mecca\" (1957), which was featured on television by Sir David Attenborough. Both \"Destination Mecca\" and \"Oriental Magic\" contain sections on the subject of Sufism.\n\nShah presented Sufism as a form of timeless wisdom that predated Islam. He emphasised that the nature of Sufism was alive, not static, and that it always adapted its visible manifestations to new times, places and people: \"Sufi schools are like waves which break upon rocks: [they are] from the same sea, in different forms, for the same purpose,\" he wrote, quoting Ahmad al-Badawi.\n\nShah was often dismissive of orientalists' descriptions of Sufism, holding that academic or personal study of its historical forms and methods was not a sufficient basis for gaining a correct understanding of it. In fact, an obsession with its traditional forms might actually become an obstacle: \"Show a man too many camels' bones, or show them to him too often, and he will not be able to recognise a camel when he comes across a live one,\" is how he expressed this idea in one of his books.\n\nShah, like Inayat Khan, presented Sufism as a path that transcended individual religions, and adapted it to a Western audience. Unlike Khan, however, he deemphasised religious or spiritual trappings and portrayed Sufism as a psychological technology, a method or science that could be used to achieve self-realisation. In doing so, his approach seemed to be especially addressed to followers of Gurdjieff, students of the Human Potential Movement, and intellectuals acquainted with modern psychology. For example, he wrote, \"Sufism ... states that man may become objective, and that objectivity enables the individual to grasp 'higher' facts. Man is therefore invited to push his evolution ahead towards what is sometimes called in Sufism 'real intellect'.\" Shah taught that the human being could acquire new subtle sense organs in response to need:\n\nShah dismissed other Eastern and Western projections of Sufism as \"watered down, generalised or partial\"; he included in this not only Khan's version, but also the overtly Muslim forms of Sufism found in most Islamic countries. On the other hand, the writings of Shah's associates implied that he was the \"Grand Sheikh of the Sufis\" – a position of authority undercut by the failure of any other Sufis to acknowledge its existence. Shah felt the best way to introduce Sufi wisdom in the West, while at the same time overcoming the problems of gurus and cults, was to clarify the difference between a cult and an educational system, and to contribute to knowledge. In an interview, he explained,\n\"You must work within an educational pattern – not in the mumbo-jumbo area.\" As part of this approach, he acted as Director of Studies at the ICR. He also lectured on the study of Sufism in the West at the University of Sussex in 1966. This was later published as a monograph entitled \"Special Problems in the Study of Sufi Ideas.\"\n\nShah later explained that Sufi activities were divided into different components or departments: \"studies \"in\" Sufism\", \"studies \"of\" Sufism\", and \"studies \"for\" Sufism\".\n\nStudies \"for\" Sufism helped lead people towards Sufism and included the promotion of knowledge which might be lacking in the culture and needed to be restored and spread, such as an understanding of social conditioning and brainwashing, the difference between the rational and intuitive modes of thought, and other activities so that people's minds could become more free and wide-ranging. Studies \"of\" Sufism included institutions and activities, such as lectures and seminars, which provided information about Sufism and acted as a cultural liaison between the Sufis and the public. Finally, Studies \"in\" Sufism referred to being in a Sufi school, carrying out those activities prescribed by the teacher as part of a training, and this could take many forms which did not necessarily fit into the preconceived notion of a \"mystical school\".\n\nShah's Sufi aims and methodologies were also delineated in the \"Declaration of the People of the Tradition\" given at Coombe Springs:\nIn addition to making this announcement, to feeding into certain fields of thought certain ideas, and pointing out some of the factors surrounding this work, the projectors of this declaration have a practical task. This task is to locate individuals who have the capacity for obtaining the special knowledge of man which is available; to group them in a special, not haphazard, manner, so that each such group forms a harmonious organism; to do this in the right place at the right time; to provide an external and interior format with which to work, as well as a formulation of 'ideas' suitable to local conditions; to balance theory with practice.\n\nIn a BBC interview from 1971, Shah explained his contemporary, adaptive approach: \"I am interested in making available in the West those aspects of Sufism which shall be of use to the West at this time. I don't want to turn good Europeans into poor Asiatics. People have asked me why I don't use traditional methods of spiritual training, for instance, in dealing with people who seek me out or hunt me down; and of course, the answer is, that it's for the same reason that you came to my house today in a motorcar and not on the back of a camel. Sufism is, in fact, not a mystical system, not a religion, but a body of knowledge.\"\n\nShah frequently characterised some of his work as really only preliminary to actual Sufi study, in the same way that learning to read and write might be seen as preliminary to a study of literature: \"Unless the psychology is correctly oriented, there is no spirituality, though there can be obsession and emotionality, often mistaken for it.\" \"Anyone trying to graft spiritual practices upon an unregenerate personality ... will end up with an aberration\", he argued. For this reason, most of the work he produced from \"The Sufis\" onwards was psychological in nature, focused on attacking the \"nafs-i-ammara\", the false self: \"I have nothing to give you except the way to understand how to seek – but you think you can already do that.\"\n\nShah was frequently criticised for not mentioning God very much in his writings; his reply was that given man's present state, there would not be much point in talking about God. He illustrated the problem in a parable in his book \"Thinkers of the East\": \"Finding I could speak the language of ants, I approached one and inquired, 'What is God like? Does he resemble the ant?' He answered, 'God! No indeed – we have only a single sting but God, He has \"two\"!'\"\n\nShah used teaching stories and humour to great effect in his work. Shah emphasised the therapeutic function of surprising anecdotes, and the fresh perspectives these tales revealed. The reading and discussion of such tales in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of Shah's study circles engaged. The transformative way in which these puzzling or surprising tales could destabilise the student's normal (and unaware) mode of consciousness was studied by Stanford University psychology professor Robert Ornstein, who along with fellow psychologist Charles Tart and eminent writers such as Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Nobel-Prize-winning novelist Doris Lessing was one of several notable thinkers profoundly influenced by Shah.\n\nShah and Ornstein met in the 1960s. Realising that Ornstein could be an ideal partner in propagating his teachings, translating them into the idiom of psychotherapy, Shah made him his deputy (\"khalifa\") in the United States. Ornstein's \"The Psychology of Consciousness\" (1972) was enthusiastically received by the academic psychology community, as it coincided with new interests in the field, such as the study of biofeedback and other techniques designed to achieve shifts in mood and awareness. Ornstein has published more books in the field over the years.\n\nPhilosopher of science and physicist Henri Bortoft used teaching tales from Shah's corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Bortoft's \"The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Way of Science\" includes tales from \"Tales of the Dervishes\", \"The Exploits of the Incomparable Mullah Nasruddin\" and \"A Perfumed Scorpion\".\n\nIn their original historical and cultural setting, Sufi teaching stories of the kind popularised by Shah – first told orally, and later written down for the purpose of transmitting Sufi faith and practice to successive generations – were considered suitable for people of all ages, including children, as they contained multiple layers of meaning. Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach: \"A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth.\" It was in this manner that Shah invited his audience to receive the Sufi story. By failing to uncover the kernel, and regarding the story as merely amusing or superficial, a person would accomplish nothing more than looking at the peach, while others internalised the tale and allowed themselves to be touched by it.\n\nTahir Shah mentions his father's storytelling at several points throughout his 2008 book \"In Arabian Nights\", first to discuss how Idries Shah made use of teaching stories: \"My father never told us how the stories worked. He did not reveal the layers, the nuggets of information, the fragments of truth and fantasy. He didn't need to – because, given the right conditions, the stories activated, sowing themselves.\" He then explains how his father used these stories to impart wisdom: \"My father always had a tale at hand to divert our attention, or to use as a way of transmitting an idea or a thought. He used to say that the great collections of stories from the East were like encyclopedias, storehouses of wisdom and knowledge ready to be studied, to be appreciated and cherished. To him, stories represented much more than mere entertainment. He saw them as complex psychological documents, forming a body of knowledge that had been collected and refined since the dawn of humanity and, more often than not, passed down by word of mouth.\"\n\nLater on in the book, he continues his discussion of stories as teaching tools, quoting the following explanation his father gave him at the end of a story:\nOlav Hammer, in \"Sufism in Europe and North America\" (2004), cites an example of such a story. It tells of a man who is looking for his key on the ground. When a passing neighbour asks the man whether this is in fact the place where he lost the key, the man replies, \"No, I lost it at home, but there is more light here than in my own house.\". Versions of this story have been known for many years in the West (see Streetlight effect). This is an example of the long-noted phenomenon of similar tales existing in many different cultures, which was a central idea in Shah's folktale collection \"World Tales\".\n\nPeter Wilson, writing in \"New Trends and Developments in the World of Islam\" (1998), quotes another such story, featuring a dervish who is asked to describe the qualities of his teacher, Alim. The dervish explains that Alim wrote beautiful poetry, and inspired him with his self-sacrifice and his service to his fellow man. His questioner readily approves of these qualities, only to find the dervish rebuking him: \"Those are the qualities which would have recommended Alim to \"you\".\" Then he proceeds to list the qualities which actually enabled Alim to be an effective teacher: \"Hazrat Alim Azimi made me irritated, which caused me to examine my irritation, to trace its source. Alim Azimi made me angry, so that I could feel and transform my anger.\" He explains that Alim Azimi followed the path of blame, intentionally provoking vicious attacks upon himself, in order to bring the failings of both his students and critics to light, allowing them to be seen for what they really were: \"He showed us the strange, so that the strange became commonplace and we could realise what it really is.\"\n\nShah's concern was to reveal essentials underlying all cultures, and the hidden factors determining individual behaviour. He discounted the Western focus on appearances and superficialities, which often reflected mere fashion and habit, and drew attention to the origins of culture and the unconscious and mixed motivations of people and the groups formed by them. He pointed out how both on the individual and group levels, short-term disasters often turn into blessings – and vice versa – and yet the knowledge of this has done little to affect the way people respond to events as they occur.\n\nShah did not advocate the abandonment of worldly duties; instead, he argued that the treasure sought by the would-be disciple should derive from one's struggles in everyday living. He considered practical work the means through which a seeker could do self-work, in line with the traditional adoption by Sufis of ordinary professions, through which they earned their livelihoods and \"worked\" on themselves.\n\nShah's status as a teacher remained indefinable; disclaiming both the guru identity and any desire to found a cult or sect, he also rejected the academic hat. Michael Rubinstein, writing in \"Makers of Modern Culture\", concluded that \"he is perhaps best seen as an embodiment of the tradition in which the contemplative and intuitive aspects of the mind are regarded as being most productive when working together.\"\n\nIdries Shah considered his books his legacy; in themselves, they would fulfil the function he had fulfilled when he could no longer be there. Promoting and distributing their teacher's publications has been an important activity or \"work\" for Shah's students, both for fund-raising purposes and for transforming public awareness. The ICR suspended its activities in 2013 following the formation of a new charity, The Idries Shah Foundation, while the SSS had ceased its activities earlier. The ISHK (Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge), headed by Ornstein, is active in the United States; after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for example, it sent out a brochure advertising Afghanistan-related books authored by Shah and his circle to members of the Middle East Studies Association, thus linking these publications to the need for improved cross-cultural understanding.\n\nWhen Elizabeth Hall interviewed Shah for \"Psychology Today\" in July 1975, she asked him: \"For the sake of humanity, what would you like to see happen?\" Shah replied: \"What I would really want, in case anybody is listening, is for the products of the last 50 years of psychological research to be studied by the public, by everybody, so that the findings become part of their way of thinking (...) they have this great body of psychological information and refuse to use it.\"\n\nShah's brother, Omar Ali-Shah (1922–2005), was also a writer and teacher of Sufism; the brothers taught students together for a while in the 1960s, but in 1977 \"agreed to disagree\" and went their separate ways. Following Idries Shah's death in 1996, a fair number of his students became affiliated with Omar Ali-Shah's movement.\n\nOne of Shah's daughters, Saira Shah, became notable in 2001 for reporting on women's rights in Afghanistan in her documentary \"Beneath the Veil\". His son, Tahir Shah, is a noted travel writer, journalist and adventurer.\n\nShah's books on Sufism achieved considerable critical acclaim. He was the subject of a BBC documentary (\"One Pair of Eyes\") in 1969, and two of his works (\"The Way of the Sufi\" and \"Reflections\") were chosen as \"Outstanding Book of the Year\" by the BBC's \"The Critics\" programme. Among other honours, Shah won six first prizes at the UNESCO World Book Year in 1973, and the Islamic scholar James Kritzeck, commenting on Shah's \"Tales of the Dervishes\", said that it was \"beautifully translated\".\n\nA collection of positive assessments of Shah's work entitled \"Sufi Studies: East and West\" was published in 1973 which included, among others, contributions from L. F. Rushbrook Williams, Rom Landau, Mohammad Hidayatullah, Gyula Germanus, Sir John Glubb, Sir Razik Fareed, Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi, Ahmet Emin Yalman, Mahmoud Youssef Shawarbi and Nasrollah S. Fatemi.\n\nColin Wilson stated that \"partly through Idries Shah, I have begun to see some rather new and interesting implications [about the subject of mysticism]\" and in his review of \"The Magic Monastery\" (1972) noted that Shah \"is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine. He is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted... [The Sufis] transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the Zen masters, and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces.\"\n\nIn Afghanistan, the \"Kabul Times\" said that \"Caravan of Dreams\" (1968) was \"highly recommended\" and \"of especial interest to Afghans\" because it is \"basically an anthology of short stories, tales and proverbs, jokes and extracts, from the written and oral literature which forms a part of many an evening's talk and interchange – even in these modern times – in Afghanistan.\" \"The Afghanistan News\" reported that \"The Sufis\" \"covers important Afghan contributions to world philosophy and science\" and was \"the first authoritative book on Sufism and the human development system of the dervishes.\" As far as doubts about Shah's background and credentials are concerned, the Sardar Haji Faiz Muhammad Khan Zikeria, an Afghan scholar who had served as Afghan Minister of Education and later Ambassador and Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, issued a notarized Declaration for the scholars of the world about the Shah family in 1970: \"The Musavi Saiyids of Afghanistan and Khans of Paghman are recognized as the descendants of the Prophet – may peace be upon him. They are recognized to be of the most noble descent of Islam and are respected as Sufi teachers and erudite scholars. Saiyid Idries Shah, son of the late Saiyid Ikbal Ali Shah, is personally known to me as an honourable man whose rank, titles and descent are attested and known by repute.\"\n\nIn 1980, Professor Khalilullah Khalili, former Poet Laureate of Afghanistan, praised the work of his \"compatriot and friend the \"Arif\" (Sufi Illuminate) The Sayed Idries Shah\", saying \"Especially to be appreciated are his brilliant and important services in revealing the celestial inspirations and inner thoughts of the great teachers of Islam and Sufis.\"\n\nThe \"Hindustan Standard\" of India found that \"Caravan of Dreams\", was a \"fine anthology, dippable-into at any time for entertainment, refreshment, consolation, and inspiration... witty, engrossing, utterly and appealingly human.\"\n\nThe Institute for Cross-cultural Exchange (ICE), a Canadian charity founded in 2004, decided to use Idries Shah's children's books to distribute to thousands of needy children in Canada, Mexico and Afghanistan, as part of their children's literacy programme and promotion of cross-cultural understanding. This series of books is published by Hoopoe Books, a non-profit initiative by the American psychologist Robert Ornstein's Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK). ISHK provides these books to needy children through their own Share Literacy initiative.\n\nA hostile critic was James Moore, a Gurdjieffian who disagreed with Shah's assertion that Gurdjieff's teaching was essentially sufic in nature and took exception to the publication of a chronologically impossible, pseudonymous book on the matter (\"The Teachers of Gurdjieff\" by Rafael Lefort) that was linked to Shah. In a 1986 article in \"Religion Today\" (now the \"Journal of Contemporary Religion\"), Moore covered the Bennett and Graves controversies and noted that Shah was surrounded by a \"nimbus of exorbitant adulation: an adulation he himself has fanned\". He described Shah as supported by a \"coterie of serviceable journalists, editors, critics, animators, broadcasters, and travel writers, which gamely choruses Shah's praise\". Moore questioned Shah's purported Sufi heritage and upbringing and deplored the body of pseudonymous \"Shah-school\" writings from such authors as \"Omar Michael Burke Ph. D.\" and \"Hadrat B. M. Dervish\", who from 1960 heaped intemperate praise – ostensibly from disinterested parties – on Shah, referring to him as the \"Tariqa Grand Sheikh Idries Shah Saheb\", \"Prince Idries Shah\", \"King Enoch\", \"The Presence\", \"The Studious King\", the \"Incarnation of Ali\", and even the Qutb or \"Axis\" – all in support of Shah's incipient efforts to market Sufism to a Western audience.\n\nPeter Wilson similarly commented on the \"very poor quality\" of much that had been written in Shah's support, noting an \"unfortunately fulsome style\", claims that Shah possessed various paranormal abilities, \"a tone of superiority; an attitude, sometimes smug, condescending, or pitying, towards those 'on the outside', and the apparent absence of any motivation to substantiate claims which might be thought to merit such treatment\". In his view, there was a \"marked difference in quality between Shah's own writings\" and the quality of this secondary literature. Both Moore and Wilson, however, also noted similarities in style, and considered the possibility that much of this pseudonymous work, frequently published by Octagon Press, Shah's own publishing house, might have been written by Shah himself.\n\nArguing for an alternative interpretation of this literature, the religious scholar Andrew Rawlinson proposed that rather than a \"transparently self-serving [...] deception\", it may have been a \"masquerade – something that by definition has to be seen through\". Stating that \"a critique of entrenched positions cannot itself be fixed and doctrinal\", and noting that Shah's intent had always been to undermine false certainties, he argued that the \"Shah myth\" created by these writings may have been a teaching tool, rather than a tool of concealment; something \"made to be deconstructed – that is \"supposed\" to dissolve when you touch it\". Rawlinson concluded that Shah \"cannot be taken at face value. His own axioms preclude the very possibility.\"\n\nDoris Lessing, one of Shah's greatest defenders, stated in a 1981 interview: \"I found Sufism as taught by Idries Shah, which claims to be the reintroduction of an ancient teaching, suitable for this time and this place. It is not some regurgitated stuff from the East or watered-down Islam or anything like that.\" In 1996, commenting on Shah's death in \"The Daily Telegraph\", she stated that she met Shah because of \"The Sufis\", which was to her the most surprising book she had read, and a book that changed her life. Describing Shah's œuvre as a \"phenomenon like nothing else in our time\", she characterised him as a many-sided man, the wittiest person she ever expected to meet, kind, generous, modest (\"Don't look so much at my face, but take what is in my hand\", she quotes him as saying), and her good friend and teacher for 30-odd years.\n\nArthur J. Deikman, a professor of psychiatry and long-time researcher in the area of meditation and change of consciousness who began his study of Sufi teaching stories in the early seventies, expressed the view that Western psychotherapists could benefit from the perspective provided by Sufism and its universal essence, provided suitable materials were studied in the correct manner and sequence. Given that Shah's writings and translations of Sufi teaching stories were designed with that purpose in mind, he recommended them to those interested in assessing the matter for themselves, and noted that many authorities had accepted Shah's position as a spokesman for contemporary Sufism. The psychologist and consciousness researcher Charles Tart commented that Shah's writings had \"produced a more profound appreciation in [him] of what psychology is about than anything else ever written\".\n\nAsked to give an assessment of Shah in 1973, J.G. Bennett said that Shah was doing important work on a large scale, \"stirring people up very effectively all over the place, making them think, showing them that modes of thought that appear to be free are really largely conditioned.\" He referred to Shah as the Krishnamurti of Sufism, breaking down people's fixed ideas in many directions as part of an awakening process that is \"a very necessary preparation for the new world.\"\n\nThe Indian philosopher and mystic Rajneesh, later known as Osho, commenting on Shah's work, described \"The Sufis\" as \"just a diamond. The value of what he has done in \"The Sufis\" is immeasurable\". He added that Shah was \"the man who introduced Mulla Nasrudin to the West, and he has done an incredible service. He cannot be repaid. [...] Idries Shah has made just the small anecdotes of Nasrudin even more beautiful ... [he] not only has the capacity to exactly translate the parables, but even to beautify them, to make them more poignant, sharper.\"\n\nRichard Smoley and Jay Kinney, writing in \"Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions\" (2006), pronounced Shah's \"The Sufis\" an \"extremely readable and wide-ranging introduction to Sufism\", adding that \"Shah's own slant is evident throughout, and some historical assertions are debatable (none are footnoted), but no other book is as successful as this one in provoking interest in Sufism for the general reader.\" They described \"Learning How to Learn\", a collection of interviews, talks and short writings, as one of Shah's best works, providing a solid orientation to his \"psychological\" approach to Sufi work, noting that at his best, \"Shah provides insights that inoculate students against much of the nonsense in the spiritual marketplace.\"\n\nIvan Tyrrell and social psychologist Joe Griffin, in their book about innate emotional needs, \"Human Givens: A new approach to emotional health and clear thinking\", wrote that Shah \"more than anyone else, understood and appreciated the real significance of the givens of human nature\". In another book, \"Godhead: The Brain's Big Bang – The explosive origin of creativity, mysticism and mental illness\", they said that Shah's stories, \"when told to young and old alike [...] lay down blueprints in the mind, not only for living and overcoming everyday difficulties but also for travelling the spiritual path. Their impact may not be recognized or felt for months or years after first hearing or reading them, but eventually the structural content they contain will exploit the pattern-matching nature of the brain and make it possible for students to observe the functioning of their own emotionally conditioned responses to changing life circumstances. It then makes it easier for them to take any action required by reality, and for their minds to connect to higher realms. Teaching stories should be read, told and reflected on, but not intellectually analysed, because that destroys the beneficial impact that they would otherwise have had on your mind.\" Shah, they added, was \"a great collector and publisher of tales and writings that contain this 'long-term impact' quality. He understood the vital importance for humanity of the 'mental blueprint' aspect of them and his books are full of nourishing examples.\"\n\nOlav Hammer notes that during Shah's last years, when the generosity of admirers had made him truly wealthy, and he had become a respected figure among the higher echelons of British society, controversies arose due to discrepancies between autobiographical data – mentioning kinship with the prophet Muhammad, affiliations with a secret Sufi order in Central Asia, or the tradition in which Gurdjieff was taught – and recoverable historical facts. While there may have been a link of kinship with the prophet Muhammad, the number of people sharing such a link today, 1300 years later, would be at least one million. Other elements of Shah's autobiography appeared to have been pure fiction. Even so, Hammer noted that Shah's books have remained in public demand, and that he has played \"a significant role in representing the essence of Sufism as a non-confessional, individualistic and life-affirming distillation of spiritual wisdom.\"\n\nPeter Wilson wrote that if Shah had been a swindler, he had been an \"extremely gifted one\", because unlike merely commercial writers, he had taken the time to produce an elaborate and internally consistent system that attracted a \"whole range of more or less eminent people\", and had \"provoked and stimulated thought in many diverse quarters\". Moore acknowledged that Shah had made a contribution of sorts in popularising a humanistic Sufism, and had \"brought energy and resource to his self-aggrandisement\", but ended with the damning conclusion that Shah's was \"a 'Sufism' without self-sacrifice, without self-transcendence, without the aspiration of gnosis, without tradition, without the Prophet, without the Qur'an, without Islam, and without God. Merely that.\"\n\nGore Vidal opined that Shah's \"books are a great deal harder to read than they were to write.\"\n\nThe reception of Shah's movement was also marked by controversy. Some orientalists were hostile, in part because Shah presented classical Sufi writings as tools for self-development to be used by contemporary people, rather than as objects of historical study.\n\nGraves' introduction to \"The Sufis\", written with Shah's help, described Shah as being \"in the senior male line of descent from the prophet Mohammed\" and as having inherited \"secret mysteries from the Caliphs, his ancestors. He is, in fact, a Grand Sheikh of the Sufi \"Tariqa\"... \" Privately, however, writing to a friend, Graves confessed that this was \"misleading: he is one of us, not a Moslem personage.\" The introduction is not included in Octagon Press editions of the book after 1983 but has always been included in the Anchor/Doubleday editions.\n\nAnd Shah's fiercest critic, University of Edinburgh scholar L.P. Elwell-Sutton, in a 1975 article critical of what he called \"pseudo-Sufis\" like Gurdjieff and Shah, opined that Graves had been trying to \"upgrade\" Shah's \"rather undistinguished lineage\", and that the reference to Mohammed's senior male line of descent was a \"rather unfortunate gaffe\", as Mohammed's sons had all died in infancy. Although Elwell-Sutton accepted that the family were Sayyids descended from the seventh Imam Musa al-Kadhim, the great-greatgrandson of Hussein ibn Ali, who was the younger son of the marriage of Fatimah (the daughter of the Prophet) and Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, he considered this an \"undistinguished lineage\" with no special sanctity because \"Sayyids proliferate throughout the Islamic world, in all walks of society and on both sides of every religious and political fence.\" He described Shah's books as \"trivial\", replete with errors of fact, slovenly and inaccurate translations and even misspellings of Oriental names and words – \"a muddle of platitudes, irrelevancies and plain mumbo-jumbo\", adding for good measure that Shah had \"a remarkable opinion of his own importance\". He took a dim view of Rushbrook Williams' \"festschrift\" (collection written in honour of) Shah, saying he considered many of the claims made in the book on behalf of Shah and his father, concerning their representing the Sufi tradition, to be self-serving publicity marked by a \"disarming disregard for facts\". Expressing amusement and amazement at the \"sycophantic manner\" of Shah's interlocutors in a BBC radio interview, Elwell-Sutton concluded that some Western intellectuals were \"so desperate to find answers to the questions that baffle them, that, confronted with wisdom from 'the mysterious East,' they abandon their critical faculties and submit to brainwashing of the crudest kind\". To Elwell-Sutton, Shah's Sufism belonged to the realm of \"Pseudo-Sufism\", \"centred not on God but on man.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Shah came under attack over a controversy surrounding the 1967 publication of a new translation of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat, by Robert Graves and Shah's older brother, Omar Ali-Shah. The translation, which presented the Rubaiyat as a Sufi poem, was based on an annotated \"crib\", supposedly derived from a manuscript that had been in the Shah family's possession for 800 years. L. P. Elwell-Sutton, an orientalist at Edinburgh University, and others who reviewed the book expressed their conviction that the story of the ancient manuscript was false.\n\nShah's father, the Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, was expected by Graves to present the original manuscript to clear the matter up, but he died in a car accident in Tangier in November 1969. A year later, Graves asked Idries Shah to produce the manuscript. Shah replied in a letter that the manuscript was not in his possession, but even if it were, producing it would prove nothing, because it could not be accurately dated using the current methods and its authenticity would still be contested. It was time, Shah wrote, \"that we realised that the hyenas who are making so much noise are intent only on opposition, destructiveness and carrying on a campaign when, let's face it, nobody is really listening.\" He added that his father had been so infuriated by those casting these aspersions that he refused to engage with them, and he felt his father's response had been correct. Graves, noting that he was now widely perceived as having fallen prey to the Shah brothers' gross deception, and that this affected income from sales of his other historical writings, insisted that producing the manuscript had become \"a matter of family honour\". He pressed Shah again, reminding him of previous promises to produce the manuscript if it were necessary.\n\nNeither of the brothers ever produced the manuscript, leading Graves' nephew and biographer to muse that it was hard to believe – bearing in mind the Shah brothers' many obligations to Graves – that they would have withheld the manuscript if it had ever existed in the first place. According to his widow writing many years later, Graves had \"complete faith\" in the authenticity of the manuscript because of his friendship with Shah, even though he never had a chance to view the text in person. The scholarly consensus today is that the \"Jan-Fishan Khan\" manuscript was a hoax, and that the Graves/Ali-Shah translation was in fact based on a Victorian amateur scholar's analysis of the sources used by previous Rubaiyat translator Edward FitzGerald.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The leading ideologue of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) from 1944 to 1957, he served as head of its Agitprop Department from 1948 to 1952 and was in charge of propaganda and culture from 1952 to 1955. He has been described as \"Moscow's right-hand man in Romania\".\n\nChișinevschi was born to a poor Jewish family in Bassarabia, then part of the Russian Empire. Largely self-taught and a high-school dropout, he joined the PCR in 1928. Arrested that year (since the PCR had been banned in 1924), he went to the Soviet Union upon his release in 1930. He attended the Comintern's International Lenin School (his only ideological training) and was a participant at the Vth PCR Congress, held in Gorikovo near Moscow in December 1931. The Comintern delegates to the congress, Béla Kun and Dmitry Manuilsky, sponsored his election to the PCR central committee. He had personal connections within the Soviet secret police, of which he was an agent (which he remained through the 1950s), infiltrating the PCR hierarchy’s upper ranks.\n\nChișinevschi came back to Romania with instructions from Moscow, helping to reorganize the Agitprop Department, the PCR’s propaganda nucleus. During the party's years of underground activity, he helped orient it toward Bolshevism (specifically Stalinism). He shunned real intellectual problems and the debates of the Marxist left, instead idolizing Joseph Stalin. He was most influenced by the latter’s \"The Problems of Leninism\", a sort of thumbnail sketch of revolutionary theory; once he had read the \"History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course\", with its blatant falsifications, he looked no further than Stalin for ideological guidance. A devoted Comintern man, he was unconcerned with Romania’s cultural and political history and context.\n\nArrested again in 1933, he was freed in 1936 and integrated into the secretariat of the Central Committee, becoming head of the Bucharest party organization.\n\nReconfirmed as a member of the PCR Central Committee in 1940, he was arrested that year, spending World War II in the Caransebeş penitentiary and the Târgu Jiu camp, where he was among the closest associates of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, especially after 1942. Having navigated for several years between the party’s Gheorghiu-Dej and Ștefan Foriș, he participated in the staging of a plot that resulted in the latter’s elimination and assassination, accusing him of being a collaborator of the Kingdom of Romania's secret police, Siguranța Statului. Joining the Politburo after August 23, 1944, he participated in the anti-intelligentsia campaign, also publishing several articles and brochures under the pen name of Stănciulescu the following year. Between 1952 and 1954, he was intimately involved in the shadowy machinations that led to the downfall of Ana Pauker, the execution of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, and the trial of Vasile Luca.\n\nDespite his Jewish ethnicity, Chișinevschi frantically distanced himself from his origins and helped persecute Jews. For instance, on January 14, 1953, he wrote: \"The Jewish communities have always been a nest of thieves, of spies. The communities have always had Filderman and from the exploitation and robbing of poor people, to acts of criminal espionage, these have been part of their agenda. This is why I think we have to proceed firmly. The devil take them—they will eventually be quiet; otherwise they will damage us, and not only us, but the entire camp of peace\".\n\nChişinevschi, known among party members as Ioșka, was a consummate intriguer and opportunist, sycophantically subservient to his superiors, vindictive, and despotic toward his subordinates. He was the patron of an entire group of crude, narrow-minded and aggressive apparatchiks who dominated Romania's spiritual life during the years of unrestrained Stalinism. As a committed Stalinist, he was unconditionally devoted to the USSR and identified his own destiny with that of the \"homeland of socialism\". He participated in all the important meetings with Soviet representatives and delegates from other Eastern European countries, also coordinating the party’s international relations and supervising cadre policy.\n\nFor Chișinevschi, one’s attitude toward the USSR was his most important criterion of Leninist orthodoxy. Thus, when the Soviets changed course at the 20th Party Congress (which Chișinevschi attended), he zealously changed course and immediately began spreading insidious critical allusions about his old friend Gheorghiu-Dej, hoping to cover up his own past crimes and abuses. At the March 1956 plenary, he and Miron Constantinescu called for a liberalisation, something that Gheorghiu-Dej categorically rejected. He did not make his proposal out of genuinely reformist sentiments, but rather because \"his enduring opportunism, his unsurpassed chameleon-type of political conduct materialized in his will to associate himself with the group that was most probable to win the battle\". As \"a true follower of Moscow’s line, whatever its twist or turn, he grasped an opportunity to undermine Gheorghiu-Dej and re-compose for himself the image of a fighter for intra-party democracy\". Thinking that \"a critical re-assessment of the Stalinist purges in Romania was inevitable\", he aligned himself in opposition to Gheorghiu-Dej.\n\nProbably encouraged by Khrushchev, Chișinevschi and Constantinescu sought allies on the Politburo to topple Gheorghiu-Dej by majority vote; they drew Constantin Pîrvulescu, president of the party control commission to their side, but failed to capture Alexandru Moghioroș, who informed Gheorghiu-Dej of the conspiracy.\n\nAfter this, despite renewed professions of faith in Gheorghiu-Dej, Chişinevschi had no chance of political survival, as the former surpassed him in ability and duplicity. During the June 28–29 and July 1–3, 1957 plenum of the Central Committee, the Chişinevschi-Constantinescu \"factionalist group\" (invented by Gheorghiu-Dej for propaganda purposes) was purged from the Politburo. In June 1960, the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party (as the PCR was then called) did not re-elect him to the Central Committee.\n\nIn late 1956, knowing about his dissent from Gheorghiu-Dej's line that March, the leaders of the Bucharest student movement of 1956 saw Chișinevschi, then vice president of the Council of Ministers, as a potential interlocutor, but he rebuffed their calls for dialogue.\n\nAt the November 30–December 5, 1961 central committee plenum, his former comrades cruelly humiliated him: Gheorghiu-Dej, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Ion Gheorghe Maurer, Leonte Răutu, Petre Borilă, Moghioroș, Alexandru Sencovici, Valter Roman did not hesitate to accuse the man formerly celebrated as the \"brain of the party\", now the director of the \"Casa Scînteii\" printing works. It was here that Gheorghiu-Dej, absolving himself of responsibility, denounced the alleged Pauker-Luca-Georgescu and Chișinevschi-Constantinescu factions as being responsible for Romania’s worst Stalinist excesses. When Chișinevschi died in 1963, no obituary appeared in Romania. In April 1968, Ceaușescu relished the opportunity to denounce him (along with Gheorghiu-Dej and Alexandru Drăghici) for Pătrășcanu’s execution.\n\nAfter Chişinevschi's first wife died, he married Liuba Chișinevschi (b. 1911), a party member from 1930 and an activist during its underground years (whose last name he took). In 1946, she helped her husband secure the job of food-procurement officer for the Soviet army of occupation in Romania. In the 1950s, she was on the Central Committee. In addition, she served as vice president of the Trade Union Confederation and of the Great National Assembly, and as deputy chair of the party's control commission. His eldest son, Milea, emigrated to Canada, while two other sons, Andrei and Gheorghe, left for Israel, where the latter died in the late 1980s. A fourth son, Iuri (b. 1945), still lived in Romania as of 2006.\n\n\n \n"}

She was raised in South Africa, where her family emigrated after World War II.\n\nProwse was born in Bombay, British India to South African parents and reared in South Africa. She began studying dance at the age of four. In her early twenties, she was dancing at a club in Paris when she was spotted by a talent agent and eventually signed to play the role of \"Claudine\" in the Walter Lang film \"Can-Can\" (1960). She had already missed a few opportunities to go to Hollywood because she was under contract but eventually left a show in Spain in which she was starring to travel to the United States for this film.\n\nIt was during the filming of \"Can-Can\" in 1959 that she captured the international spotlight. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev visited the set of the film and after Prowse performed a rather saucy can-can for the Russian leader, he proclaimed her dance \"immoral.\" The publicity brought Prowse considerable attention in the United States. From there, her career accelerated.\n\nProwse met Frank Sinatra on the set of \"Can-Can\". \"Time\" magazine did not rate the movie highly, but declared Prowse the best thing in it: \"In fact, the only thing really worth seeing is Juliet Prowse, a young South African hoofer who puts some twinkle in the stub-toed choreography. And the only thing really worth hearing is the crack that Frank flips back at Juliet when she whips a redoubtable hip in his direction. \"Don't point\", he gasps. \"It's rude.\" She would go on to appear with Sinatra and other notable guests such as Ella Fitzgerald, Peter Lawford, Hermione Gingold, the Hi-Lo's, Red Norvo, Nelson Riddle and his orchestra on the 1959 \"Frank Sinatra Show\". She at times would sing in the chorus with other guests or Sinatra would sing to her.\n\nSinatra invited Prowse to join him in Las Vegas, even though she was living with the actor Nico Minardos at the time. Sinatra and Prowse announced their engagement in 1962. Soon afterwards they broke up, reportedly because Prowse wanted to concentrate on her career. Prowse later admitted, \"I was as much flattered as I was in love. He (Sinatra) was a complex person, and after a few drinks he could be very difficult.\"\nProwse co-starred alongside Elvis Presley in \"G.I. Blues\" (1960). During shooting of the film, they had a short and intense fling. \"Elvis and I had an affair. ... We had a sexual attraction like two healthy young people, but he was already a victim of his fans. We always met in his room and never went out.\" Prowse also made a brief cameo appearance in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer documentary film, \"\" (1970) as an interviewed audience member about to attend Elvis Presley's opening night show at the International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada on August 10, 1970.\n\nShe starred with Denny Scott Miller on her own NBC sitcom in the 1965-1966 season: \"Mona McCluskey\", which was produced by George Burns. The series was based on the idea that the couple, Mike and Mona McCluskey, would live on his military salary, rather than her lucrative earnings as an actress. Miller died on September 9, 2014.\n\nProwse also did other feature films, including \"The Fiercest Heart\" (1961) and \"Who Killed Teddy Bear?\" (1965) with Sal Mineo and Elaine Stritch.\n\nAlthough her film and television career did not make her as big a star as predicted, Prowse had a rather philosophical way of looking at it. \"Things generally happen for the best. ... I never worry about what happens in my career, because I can always do something else.\" Prowse would later go on to headline successful Las Vegas shows, commanding a very high salary. Stating that Las Vegas was the most demanding place she ever worked, she won \"Entertainer of the Year\" for the Vegas run of \"Sweet Charity\". She would later show off her famous dancer's legs in a series of lucrative nationwide commercials for a number of advertisers, including L'eggs hosiery and Mannington Flooring.\n\nProwse was the first guest to appear on an episode of \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, she was mauled by an 80-pound leopard – twice. Once, while filming a scene for \"Circus of the Stars\" in 1987 and later that same year rehearsing a promotional stunt on \"The Tonight Show\", when the same leopard attacked her. The later attack was more serious, requiring upwards of twenty stitches to reattach her ear.\n\nThroughout the mid-1980s and 1990s, Prowse hosted the \"Championship Ballroom Dance Competition\" on PBS.\nIn 1994, Prowse was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In 1995, she went into remission and was well enough to tour with Mickey Rooney in \"Sugar Babies\".

Her mother, Cleona Florine (Bower) Henderson was of white descent, Linda's uncle, Wesley Henderson, helped form the White Buffalo Council in Denver during the 1950s, to help other Indian people coming to the city because of The Relocation Act, which forcibly removed Indigenous peoples for work and other opportunities. He had a strong influence on her and she grew up relating strongly to both her Chickasaw family in Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and to a mixed Indian community in the Denver area. At other times, her family traveled because of her father's career in the U.S. military. Her family lived in Germany for three years. She descended from a family of storytellers who helped shape her writing Along with being an author, Hogan is also an environmentalist who spent eight years volunteering at a wildlife rehabilitation center. Two out of those eight years were spent at veterinarian school and the other six were spent at Birds of Prey Rehabilitation Center in Colorado. The work was very physical so Hogan reached a point where she was no longer able to handle it. Now, she does good for animals by talking and writing about them Hogan married Pat Hogan and had children, Sandra Dawn Protector and Tanya Thunder Horse\n\nHogan earned a Master of Arts (M. A.) degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1978 at the Colorado Springs campus.

Hogan started writing in her late twenties after working with orthopedically handicapped children. During her lunch hours, she would read Kenneth Rexroth's work, which gave her the confidence to start writing publicly She kept a journal that she wrote in religiously. As she began to write essays and fiction, she realized that the energy she put into writing in a journal, had a new outlet. As she journaled, she also discovered that she was writing about the beauty of nature every morning and she believed she could do more for nature in less private writing settings After writing her first book, \"Calling Myself Home\", she continued to write poetry. Her work has both a historical and political focus, but is lyrical. Hogan's lyrical work is considered to have a voice of literary activism and in it is Native spirituality and indigenous knowledge systems of all genres She considers her work politically centered because it is about a world view that cannot be separated from the political. Her most recent books are \"The Book of Medicines\" (1993) and \"Rounding the Human Corners.\" (2008) and a book of new and selected poetry containing work from the 1970s until 2014.

Since leaving \"The X Factor\", Michael has been taking an interest in modelling and has done many photoshoots since.\n\nThe \"Girls\" category was mentored by Kelly Rowland. Contestants in this category are females aged 16 to 24. The eight candidates were Misha Bryan, Janet Devlin, Sophie Habibis, Amelia Lily, Melanie McCabe, Holly Repton, Jade Richards and Sarah Watson.

For the first week, Misha sang \"Rolling in the Deep\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" regarded this performance as a highlight of the series, saying she \"oozed star quality from the start... Like a 21st-century Grace Jones or an urban Lady Gaga, the teenager seemed like a proper pop star already.\" For the next two weeks Bryan sang \"Would I Lie to You?\" and \"Purple Rain\". In week four she sang \"Tainted Love\", but was in the bottom two and had to sing for survival in the final showdown against Sophie Habibis. After singing \"Use Somebody\" as her survival song, she was unanimously saved by the judges, and Barlow's vote was unnecessary for the result. However it was revealed that Habibis received more votes than Misha B meaning if the result went to deadlock, Habibis would have been saved. For the fifth week, Misha B sang \"Proud Mary\". On week six, Misha sang \"Born This Way\", but again she landed in the final showdown against Brucknell and sang \"Who You Are\" as her survival song. Walsh (Brucknell's mentor) voted to eliminate her, but Tulisa, Rowland and Barlow voted to save her. However voting statistics revealed that Brucknell received more votes than Misha B meaning if Barlow sent the result went to deadlock, Brucknell would have been saved. On week seven, Misha sang \"I Have Nothing\". Barlow also told Misha B \"I want to see the Misha B we saw at the first audition\", which led to Misha singing \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" on the eighth week. Misha B ended up in the final showdown for the third time in week eight, and sang \"Out Here on My Own\", with Walsh and Conotstavlos saving her, and Rowland refusing to vote between her and Janet Devlin, meaning Misha B was saved. Barlow also revealed he would have saved her. However it was revealed that Devlin received more votes than Misha B meaning if the result went to deadlock, Devlin would have been sent through to the semi-final and Misha B would have been eliminated. On 3rd December, Misha sang \"Dancing in the Street\" and \"Perfect\", but she was voted out of the competition, finishing in 4th place. For her farewell performance \"Misha B busted out a short self-penned rap, before segueing into a blinding rendition of Jessie J’s Who You Are.\"\n\nA variety of sources including \"The Daily Telegraph\", Digital Spy and bluesandsoul.com have considered Misha B as one of the more gifted and exciting acts ever to have come out of a talent competition. BBC 1xtra noting her \"show-stopping performances\", considered her to be one of the most credible artists to emerge from the show and a \"break from the traditional X Factor contestant\". Bryan was involved in a controversy during the third live show when Tulisa Contostavlos accused her of making \"mean comments\" and Louis Walsh accused her of being a \"bully\" backstage. No evidence was ever provided to support either allegation and both accusers apologised the next day. The other two judges and her fellow contestants defended Misha B during and after the show. Judge Gary Barlow later said he believed the wrongful allegations had ended Misha B's chances of winning the competition. Bryan asked about her experience on X Factor said \"I one hundred percent appreciate the platform it gave me...but it's not for the faint-hearted lol. You have to remember that at the end of the day it’s an entertainment show for TV.\" \"Things are said which are out of all of our hands as contestants. I wasn't asked any questions, I was just accused.\" Misha B spoke to grammy.com in 2013, \"I experienced not only highs but my share of lows on \"The X Factor\", but it has set me up with the thick skin needed for this industry... I will always be grateful for my time on the show. I mean, it got me to where I needed to be.\"\n\nPost X Factor Bryan signed to Relentless Records and released a free fifteen-minute mixtape entitled \"Why Hello World\" (2012).

On week 8 she sang \"MMMBop\" and \"Under the Bridge\", but was in the bottom two against Misha B.

On 26 October 2011, Rhythmix announced that they would change their name following a dispute with a children's music charity of the same name, after the programme tried to trademark \"Rhythmix\" in Europe.

A spokesperson for \"The X Factor\" said, \"At the request of the charity Rhythmix, the members of the girl group Rhythmix have decided to change their name, a decision which has the support of Syco and TalkbackTHAMES. The group's new name will be announced in due course\". It was reported that the band decided to make the change, despite no legal reason to do so, to avoid any difficulties for the charity. They announced that they would now be known as Little Mix on 28 October 2011 following on from this, the band said: \"We all agreed on it, including Tulisa, because it just felt right\". Little Mix became the first girl band in the history of \"The X Factor\" to make it to the final live show.

Healy originally auditioned in another group, The Keys, while the other three auditioned as soloists. Andy previously auditioned for \"The X Factor\" in 2008, and came second in the United Kingdom selection for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2004. The band came under criticism from a Scottish band from Prestwick, who have been performing together for several years as The Risk. They asked \"The X Factor\" management to change the name of its contestants to avoid confusion.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, just before week four's live show, it was announced that original member Ashley Baptiste had decided to leave the band after stating that his heart did not lie within a boyband any more.

At the age of 14, he and his younger brother Anastasio attended Saint Leo College Prep near Tampa, before transferring to La Salle Military Academy on Long Island. Luis was then educated at Louisiana State University, where he was a member of Fi Sigma Alfa Hispanic fraternity. Following the assassination of his father, Anastasio Somoza García, Luis was tapped as acting president, and was elected president in his own right later that year. His rule was somewhat milder than that of his father. However, civil liberties remained restricted, and corruption remained widespread.\n\nHis brother, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, headed the National Guard and was the second most powerful man in the country during his older brother's rule. Although Luis declined to run for reelection in 1963, he and Anastasio saw to it that the presidency was held from 1963 onward by politicians loyal to the Somozas. As a result, Luis remained the real power in Nicaragua until his death in 1967, when he suffered a massive heart attack in Managua at the age of 44.\n\nUnder Luis Somoza's regime, Nicaragua played a key role leading to the creation of the Central American Common Market, with the Alliance for Progress backing that common market's creation. During the Bay of Pigs Invasion, he allowed the CIA-trained Cuban rebels to embark from Puerto Cabezas, on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. The Sandinistas began their struggle against the government in 1963—a struggle that would oust his brother in 1979.\n\nHe is entombed at Cementerio Occidental with his father, in the National Guard Mausoleum in Managua, Nicaragua.

Like all Sinn Féin MPs, McGuinness abstained from participation in the Westminster Parliament. Following the St Andrews Agreement and the Assembly election in 2007, as Sinn Féin's political leader in the North, he became deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland on 8 May 2007, with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley becoming First Minister. On 5 June 2008 he was re-appointed as deputy First Minister to serve alongside Peter Robinson, who succeeded Paisley as First Minister. McGuinness previously served as Minister of Education in the Northern Ireland Executive between 1999 and 2002. He was Sinn Féin's candidate for President of Ireland in the 2011 election.\n\nWorking alongside US Special Envoy George Mitchell, McGuinness was also one of the main architects of the Good Friday Agreement which formally cemented the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nOn 9 January 2017, McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister in a protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. He announced on 19 January that he would not be standing for re-election to the Northern Ireland Assembly in the 2 March 2017 election due to ill health. He reportedly suffered from amyloidosis, a condition that attacks the vital organs, and retired shortly before his death on 21 March 2017, aged 66.\n\nMcGuinness acknowledged that he was a former IRA member, but stated that he left the IRA in 1974. He originally joined the Official IRA, unaware of the split at the December 1969 Army Convention, switching to the Provisional IRA soon after. By the start of 1972, at the age of 21, he was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry, a position he held at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights protesters were killed in the city by soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment.\n\nDuring the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward stated he had been the leader of the Fianna, the youth wing of the IRA at the time of Bloody Sunday. He said that McGuinness and an anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts that morning. He said that his organisation intended to attack city centre premises in Derry on the same day. In response, McGuinness said the statements were \"fantasy\", while Gearóid Ó hEára (formerly Gerry O'Hara), a Derry Sinn Féin councillor, stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.\n\nThe inquiry concluded that, although McGuinness was \"engaged in paramilitary activity\" at the time of Bloody Sunday and had probably been armed with a Thompson submachine gun, there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were \"sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire\".\n\nMcGuinness negotiated alongside Gerry Adams with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Willie Whitelaw, in 1972. In 1973, he was convicted by the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being arrested near a car containing of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. In court, he declared his membership of the Provisional IRA without equivocation: \"We have fought against the killing of our people... I am a member of Óglaigh na hÉireann and very, very proud of it\".\n\nAfter his release, and another conviction in the Republic of Ireland for IRA membership, he became increasingly prominent in Sinn Féin, the political wing of the republican movement. He was in indirect contact with British intelligence during the 1981 hunger strikes, and again in the early 1990s. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont in 1982, representing Londonderry. He was the second candidate elected after John Hume. As with all elected members of Sinn Féin and the SDLP, he did not take up his seat. On 9 December 1982, McGuinness, Gerry Adams and Danny Morrison were banned from entering Great Britain under the Prevention of Terrorism Act by the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw.\n\nIn August 1993, he was the subject of a two-part special by \"The Cook Report\", a Central TV investigative documentary series presented by Roger Cook. It accused him of continuing involvement in IRA activity, of attending an interrogation and of encouraging Frank Hegarty, an informer, to return to Derry from a safe house in England. Hegarty's mother Rose appeared on the programme to tell of telephone calls to McGuinness and of Hegarty's subsequent murder. McGuinness denied her account and denounced the programme saying \"I have never been in the IRA. I don't have any sway over the IRA\".\n\nIn 2005, Michael McDowell, the Irish Tánaiste, stated McGuinness, along with Gerry Adams and Martin Ferris, were members of the seven-man IRA Army Council. McGuinness denied this, saying he was no longer an IRA member. Experienced Troubles journalist Peter Taylor presented further apparent evidence of McGuinness's role in the IRA in his documentary \"Age of Terror\", shown in April 2008. In his documentary, Taylor alleges that McGuinness was the head of the IRA's Northern Command and had advance knowledge of the IRA's 1987 Enniskillen bombing, which left 11 civilians dead.\n\nHe became Sinn Féin's chief negotiator in the Northern Ireland peace process negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement. At the time of his death, former US President Bill Clinton noted that McGuinness was the one who personally oversaw the Agreement's arms decommissioning phase. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also acknowledged the leading role which McGuinness had in ensuring the Agreement would be enforced.\n\nHe was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996 representing Foyle. Having contested Foyle unsuccessfully at the 1983, 1987 and 1992 Westminster elections, he became MP for Mid Ulster in 1997 and after the Agreement was concluded, was returned as a member of the Assembly for the same constituency, and nominated by his party for a ministerial position in the power-sharing executive, where he became Minister of Education. One of his controversial acts as Minister of Education was his decision to scrap the 11-plus exam, which he had failed as a child. He was re-elected to the Westminster Parliament in 2001, 2005 and 2010.\n\nIn May 2003, transcripts of telephone calls between McGuinness and British officials including Mo Mowlam, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's Chief of Staff, were published in a biography of McGuinness entitled \"From Guns to Government\" by Kathryn Johnston and Liam Clarke. The tapes had been made by MI5 and the authors of the book were arrested under the Official Secrets Act. The conversations showed an easy and friendly relationship between McGuinness and Powell. He joked with Powell about unionist MPs while Mowlam referred to him as \"babe\" and discussed her difficulties with Blair. In another transcript, he praised Bill Clinton to Gerry Adams.\n\nIn the weeks following the St Andrews Agreement, the four biggest parties—the DUP, Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP—indicated their choice of ministries in the Executive and nominated members to fill them. The Assembly convened on 8 May 2007 and Paisley and McGuinness were nominated as First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively. On 12 May Sinn Féin agreed to take up three places on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, and nominated three MLAs to take them.\n\nOn 8 December 2007, while visiting President of the United States George W. Bush in the White House with the Northern Ireland First Minister Ian Paisley, McGuinness said to the press, \"Up until the 26 March this year, Ian Paisley and I never had a conversation about anything—not even about the weather—and now we have worked very closely together over the last seven months and there's been no angry words between us... This shows we are set for a new course.\"\n\nOn 16 September 2011 McGuinness was announced as the Sinn Féin candidate in the 2011 Irish presidential election. In the election held on 27 October, McGuinness placed third in the first preference vote, behind Michael D. Higgins and Seán Gallagher.\n\nMcGuinness was the only candidate ineligible to vote in the election as, although an Irish citizen, he was not ordinarily resident in the Republic of Ireland. Following his defeat, McGuinness formally returned to the role of deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland on 31 October.\n\nOn 30 December 2012 McGuinness announced that he had formally resigned as the MP for Mid-Ulster stating \"I have served formal notice of my resignation from the position of MP for Mid-Ulster with immediate effect. This is in line with my party's commitment to end double jobbing.\" To do this, he was made Steward of the Manor of Northstead on 2 January 2013 by Chancellor George Osborne, making him an employee of the Crown and thus ineligible for membership of the House of Commons.\n\nIn November 2016, a scandal came to light surrounding the Renewable Heat Incentive, an energy incentive championed by Arlene Foster when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Incentives in 2012. The incentive would cost the Northern Ireland Executive £480m over 20 years, and was marred by allegations of fraud, which were not acknowledged or acted upon by Foster or the DUP. McGuinness and others in Sinn Féin called for Foster (now First Minister) to step aside to allow for independent inquiries, but Foster refused. Foster made a statement before the Assembly on 19 December without McGuinness' approval (as required under the power-sharing agreement), resulting in Sinn Féin and the opposition parties all walking out of the Assembly.\n\nSinn Féin President Gerry Adams indicated on 8 January 2017 that McGuinness could resign, thus vacating both his and Foster's offices, if Foster did not agree to temporarily step aside to allow an independent inquiry. McGuinness resigned the following day; in his statements to the press, he said \"Today is the right time to call a halt to the DUP's arrogance\", and said that Foster had a \"clear conflict of interest\" in the affair. Another reason cited for his resignation was the decision by DUP Minister for Communities Paul Givan to remove £50,000 in funding from the Liofa Gaeltacht Bursary scheme, a yearly programme that allowed 100 school-age children to travel to the Donegal Gaeltacht to learn the Irish language. Sinn Féin refused to nominate a successor to McGuinness before 16 January, resulting in the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, calling for new elections scheduled for 2 March. McGuinness subsequently announced that he would not run for re-election, due to ill health.\n\nOne of McGuinness's middle names, Pacelli, is after Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli).\n\nMcGuinness attended first St. Eugene's Primary School and later the Christian Brothers technical college, leaving school at the age of 15.\n\nMcGuinness married Bernadette Canning in 1974; they had four children, two girls and two boys. He was a fan of the Derry Gaelic football and hurling teams and played both sports when he was younger. He grew up just 50 metres from Celtic Park, the home of Derry's Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). His older brother Tom played Gaelic football for Derry and is regarded as one of the county's best ever players. He had three Ulster Senior Football Championship medals, as well as Ulster Under 21 and All-Ireland Under 21 Championship medals. He supported Derry City F.C. where his younger brother Paul played for the Candystripes.\n\nMcGuinness supported Manchester United from the age of eight. McGuinness also had an interest in cricket – sometimes extending his support to the England cricket team, as well as that of Ireland.\n\n \nMcGuinness was a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, which meant that he did not drink alcohol.\n\nIn December 2016, McGuinness was advised against making a planned visit to China on medical grounds, initially announcing that this was due to \"unforeseen personal circumstances\". After subsequent tests, he was told that he was suffering from \"a very serious illness\". McGuinness and Sinn Féin declined to give details of his illness to the media. In January 2017, \"The Irish Times\" disclosed that McGuinness was suffering from amyloidosis, a rare incurable disease that affects organs. McGuinness complained that the \"Times\" had breached his privacy.\n\nOn 6 March 2017 McGuinness was hospitalised at Derry's Altnagelvin Area Hospital due to ill health. He died on 21 March, at the age of 66.\n\n\n"}

His interest started when he had a dream of himself praying on top of Mt. Everest. His first climb in the Himalaya was in April 2004, when he tried to climb Mera Peak () in Nepal, but had to retreat just from the top because of illness.\nHis ascent of Everest was finally made on May25, 2008, Jordan Independence Day, after he had sold some of his possessions to fund the expedition.

He is the author of Cryptocat, an open-source encrypted web chat client. Kobeissi is also known for speaking publicly against Internet censorship and Internet surveillance. \n\nKobeissi was born in Beirut, Lebanon. He studied psychology at the Lebanese American University in Beirut from 2008–2009, and graduated with a double major in political science and philosophy at Concordia University in Montreal in 2013. \n\nAfter that he was a PhD student studying applied cryptography at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Inria), in France and worked at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, United Kingdom.\n\nKobeissi is the primary author of Cryptocat. In 2012, he presented Cryptocat at the HOPE hacker conference in New York City. During the following year, Kobeissi presented Cryptocat-related talks and research at Google's Internet at Liberty conference, Beirut's SHARE conference, the Chaos Computer Club's SIGINT2013 conference, at RightsCon in Rio de Janeiro, and at Republika in Rijeka, Croatia.\n\nKobeissi is also known for discovering a privacy issue in Windows 8, in which the operating system automatically reported to Microsoft what applications users were installing in an insecure fashion. Kobeissi's research was picked up by Gizmodo and Microsoft issued a response. Kobeissi is also a known proponent of browser cryptography and is a member of the W3C's Web Cryptography Working Group.\n\nIn 2010, Kobeissi was one of the earliest supporters of the Bradley Manning Support Network. He organized a march through Montreal in December that year in support of WikiLeaks, ran a WikiLeaks mirror site, and defended WikiLeaks on various Canadian news publications. During 2011 and 2012, Kobeissi hosted CHOMP.FM, a radio program on Internet activism that ran weekly on Montreal's CKUT-FM radio station. The show included guests from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), security researcher Bruce Schneier, and journalist Glenn Greenwald.\n\nIn 2013, Kobeissi led an effort known as the Skype Open Letter which brought together more than forty organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Reporters Without Borders, and the Open Technology Institute, calling on Microsoft and Skype to release transparency reports regarding Skype monitoring and surveillance. The effort was successful, and Microsoft released its first transparency report shortly after the letter was published.\n\nKobeissi was detained and questioned at the U.S. border by the DHS in June 2012 about Cryptocat's censorship resistance. He tweeted about the incident afterwards, resulting in media coverage and a spike in the popularity of Cryptocat. Kobeissi was regularly searched and questioned whenever he flew in the U.S. in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the FBI attempted to entrap Kobeissi using Sabu – an American hacker involved with LulzSec, an offshoot of Anonymous – as an undercover informant. Kobeissi responded on his blog: \"To all young hackers out there – use your talents for research. Never acquiesce to anything illegal with anyone, even if they do it with you.\"\n\nIn mid-2013, critical vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed in the Cryptocat application suite, potentially exposing prior communication via the chat program for over a year. The vulnerability was limited to group chat and did not affect private one-on-one conversations. The ensuing controversy centered on the technical naïveté of Nadim and others who had worked on the project. Steve Thomas, the security researcher who discovered the vulnerabilities, blogged criticizing Cryptocat as \"run by people that don't know crypto, make stupid mistakes, and [does not have] enough eyes [that] are looking at their code to find the bugs.\" However, this comment was removed in more recent versions of Thomas's blog post.\n\nMeanwhile, other security blogs and news sites called the vulnerability a \"responsible disclosure\" and praised Cryptocat's transparency regarding vulnerabilities and Kobeissi's warnings regarding the experimental nature of the project. Adam Caudill, an independent security researcher noted that \"[Cryptocat developers] didn't understand the data they were working with. [...] anyone [could] crack the keys in a frighteningly short amount of time.\" However, Caudill later also stated that even in light of the controversy, \"Cryptocat still achieves its basic goal.\"\n\nKobeissi himself had been vocal in the past about other services using encryption. In a \"Forbes\" online article investigating the security of encrypted storage service MEGA, Kobeissi, who voiced concern along with other security researchers, noted: \"It's a nice website, but when it comes to cryptography they seem to have no experience\". This made Cryptocat's own vulnerabilities a more high-profile discussion among security researchers. Nevertheless, MEGA eventually adopted Kobeissi's critique and implemented the suggested changes to their cryptographic code delivery methods.\n\nIn January 2016 Kobeissi tweeted his reasons for leaving Peerio, a cloud-based encrypted communications company he co-founded. These centred around potential plans to sell backdoored versions of the Peerio software to certain clients. Peerio soon denied the claims on their own blog.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "64917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64917", "title": "Nelson Muntz", "text": "Nelson Muntz\n\nNelson Muntz is a fictional character and the lead school bully from the animated television series \"The Simpsons\", best known for his signature mocking laugh \"Ha-ha!\". He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and was introduced in Season 1's \"Bart the General\" as an antagonist but later turned into an on-and-off friend of Bart Simpson.\n\nNelson is a student and bully at Springfield Elementary School. He is known to have terrorized virtually every kid in Springfield at one point or another. Most often, however, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as Milhouse and Martin, who are the subject of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, though, and other characters have occasionally warmed to him; Lisa dates him briefly in \"Lisa's Date with Density\", Marge informally adopts him in \"Sleeping with the Enemy\", and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\".\n\nHis family life is dysfunctional. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as Nelson's dad going insane and abandoning him, Nelson's parents divorcing because of his mom's cough drop addiction, or Nelson's dad in prison while his mom \"has bigger problems\"), the canon story that has evolved is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at Hooters or in a topless bar. The character design and voice portrayal of both parents has varied throughout the course of the series.\n\nIt is shown in many episodes that Nelson's father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he \"went to pick up some Pop-Tarts\" although, later on in the series, he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode \"Brother from the Same Planet\", Nelson's father is the children's soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson's father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode \"Bart's Girlfriend\"; depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode \"Bart Star\" to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he \"doesn't want to see [his] Mom at work\"). Nelson's father returns in the sixteenth-season episode \"Sleeping with the Enemy\". It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts and had an allergic reaction, covering 90% of his body with large tumors. Looking like Joseph Merrick, he ran out of the store and encountered a circus that made him a part of its freak show. At performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge).\n\nNelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode \"Bart Star\", Nelson almost singlehandedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on \"The Grapes of Wrath\", consisting of himself crushing a bunch of grapes with a hammer, stating \"Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath!\" In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even submitting a film to the Sundance Film Festival about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, \"I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Little Big Girl\", it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in \"Much Apu About Nothing\", Nelson picks on foreign exchange student Üter for being German during Springfield's anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of Andy Williams as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in \"Bart on the Road\".\n\nEven though in the first season (and for many seasons afterwards) Nelson seemed to be Bart's antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered as Bart's second closest friend after Milhouse.\n\nIn his debut episode, Lisa was the initial target of Nelson's bullying, which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart's actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from Herman, who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with water balloons. From that point on, Nelson shows a grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behavior towards him.\n\nAlthough still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as Milhouse Van Houten and occasionally even common bullying target Martin Prince. In \"The Debarted\", it is shown that Nelson has become Bart's \"other best friend\", along with Milhouse.\n\nNelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendencies, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In \"Lisa's Date with Density\", Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph, who believe that kissing girls is \"gay\" (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in \"New Kid On The Block\").\n\nHe also punishes Sherri and Terri for tormenting Lisa. Another curious example of his \"good side\" is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. In \"Dial 'N' for Nerder\", when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavours to learn the truth and find Martin's killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp, and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\")\n\nIn \"Loan-a Lisa\", Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realising he won't change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her.\n\nThough Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and-off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney, and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang).\n\nIn \"Sleeping with the Enemy\", Moe Szyslak appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntz are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe's childhood experiences and behaviors are somewhat relatable with Nelson's. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off screen by the Muntz' confused looks.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening named Nelson after the wrestling hold of the same name. Nelson was also said to be named after popular Brat Pack actor Judd Nelson, who portrayed the character John Bender in the eighties classic \"The Breakfast Club\", partially of whom Nelson Muntz's character has similarities. Cast member Nancy Cartwright voices the character, which first appeared in the fifth episode of the first season, \"Bart the General\" (1990). American voice actress Dana Hill was first supposed to provide Nelson's voice, and attended the read-through of the episode. However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography \"My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy\", \"the producers were still putting together this ensemble of [actors] and, come Monday, at the recording, she was nowhere to be found and the part was assigned to me. I didn't have time to ask why and I still don't have a clue.\" Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, \"I asked myself, 'What does a bully sound like?' Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, 'I'll get you after school, man!' I let out a sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh.\"\n\nBy the eighth season of \"The Simpsons\", the writers had begun to explore the secondary characters of the show. \"Lisa's Date with Density\" (season eighth, 1996) was the first episode to center around Nelson and was used to explain why he acts the way he does. The idea of Nelson dating Lisa Simpson had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show. Cartwright said in 2012 that she thinks Nelson \"has evolved the most out of all the characters I do. There's a soft spot in him that the writers have found. He's got this special attraction to Marge, and he sings these songs, and he's got a crush on Lisa. There's something about this poor kid – his mother works at Hooters, his dad went out to buy milk and never came back. I wouldn't want him to come over for dinner, but I really love doing his voice.\"\n\nThe episode \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\" in 2007 was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. The writer of the episode Matt Selman was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award.\n\nIn his review of the season 22 episode \"Loan-a Lisa\", Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club commented that Nelson's character has undergone a \"\", in reference to the bully's near-exclusive portrayal as being likable and vulnerable in later seasons of the program.\n\n"}

According to that traditional literature, Ragnar distinguished himself by many raids against Francia and Anglo-Saxon England during the 9th century. There is no known evidence to substantiate that he actually existed under this name and outside of the mythology associated with him.\n\nAccording to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, Ragnar was the son of the Swedish king Sigurd Hring. \n\nThe Hervarar saga tells that when Valdar died, his son Randver became the king of Sweden, while Harald Wartooth became the king of Denmark. Then Harald conquered all of his grandfather Ivar Vidfamne's territory. After Randver's death, his son Sigurd Hring became the king of Sweden, presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd Hring and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir (Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland, where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd ruled Sweden and Denmark from about 770 until his death in about 804. He was succeeded by his son Ragnar Lodbrok. Harald Wartooth's son Eysteinn Beli ruled Sweden as Ragnar's viceroy until he was killed by the sons of Ragnar.\n\nThe Tale of Ragnar's Sons tells that the Great Heathen Army that invaded England in 865 was led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had supposedly captured and executed Ragnar.\n\nThe Siege of Paris and the Sack of Paris of 845 was the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the West Franks. The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named \"Reginherus\", or Ragnar. This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok, but the accuracy of this remains a disputed issue among historians. Around 841, Ragnar had been awarded land in Turholt, Frisia, by Charles the Bald, but he eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King. Ragnar's Vikings raided Rouen on their way up the Seine in 845, and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal Abbey of Saint-Denis (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river. Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine. This was done to honour the Norse god Odin, as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.\n\nThe Great Heathen Army is said to have been led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had supposedly executed Ragnar in 865 by casting him into a pit full of snakes. The Great Heathen Army was organized and led by the brothers Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, Halfdan, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. The first four are known historical figures.\n\nIvar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 870, but he disappears from English historical accounts after 870. The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records Ivar's death as 870. Halfdan Ragnarsson became the leader of the Great Heathen Army in about 870 and he led it in an invasion of Wessex. A great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by King Bagsecg of Denmark, bolstering the ranks of Halfdan's army. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Danes battled the West Saxons nine times, including the Battle of Ashdown on 8 January 871, where Bagsecg was killed. Halfdan accepted a truce from the future Alfred the Great, newly crowned king of Wessex. \n\nHalfdan succeeded Bagsecg as King of most of Denmark (Jutland and Wendland) in about 871. Bjorn Ironside became King of Sweden and Uppsala in about 865, (the same year his father Ragnar is said to have died). Bjorn had two sons, Refil and Erik Björnsson. His son Erik became the next king of Sweden, and was succeeded in turn by Erik the son of Refil. Sigurd Snake-in-the-eye became King of Zealand and the Danish Isles in about 871, and also succeeded his brother Halfdan as King of Denmark in about 877.\n\nWhereas Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan Ragnarsson are widely considered to have been actual historical figures, opinion regarding their supposed father is divided, but stories about him are mostly believed to be fictional. According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, writing in 1979: \"Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact.\" A generation later, however, Katherine Holman, writing in 2003, expressed the more nuanced contemporary opinion: \"Although his sons are\nhistorical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived, and he seems to be an amalgam of several different historical figures and pure literary invention.\"\n\nAccording to traditional sources, Ragnar (possibly as a literary composite) was:\n\nThe most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:\n\nThe extent of Ragnar's historicity is not clear.\n\nIn her commentary on Saxo's \"Gesta Danorum\", Davidson notes that Saxo's coverage of Ragnar's legend in book IX of the \"Gesta\" appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the \"Gesta\" can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable. These candidates for the \"historical Ragnar\" include:\n\nSo far, attempts to firmly link the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. Nonetheless, the core tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-9th-century Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are covered by relatively reliable sources, such as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\n\nRagnar Lodbrok features prominently in:\n\n\n"}

Corrington (born May 30, 1950) is an American philosopher and author of many books exploring human interpretation of the universe as well as biographies on C.S. Peirce and Wilhelm Reich. He is currently the Henry Anson Buttz Professor of Philosophical Theology at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. Before that he was a professor at Pennsylvania State University. He is a Senior Fellow of the American Institute for Philosophical and Cultural Thought.\n\nCorrington is member of Unitarian Universalist Association and The Theosophical Society of America and a lecturer for both organizations, and he is also an affiliate of The Parapsychological Association.\n\nRobert S. Corrington’s work contributes to philosophical and theological inquiry through the development of a perspective called 'ecstatic naturalism’. Ecstatic naturalism, also referred to as ‘deep pantheism’ or ‘religious naturalism,’ has emerged through Corrington’s eleven books and over eighty articles on the subject. His influences are many and range across the disciplines of philosophy, theology, science, and psychology. Deep appreciation of the American philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, George Santayana, Justus Buchler and John Dewey grounds Corrington’s insights in a pragmatist mode even as his work creatively extends this tradition philosophically through a psychologically sophisticated semiotics with the aid of Carl Jung, Otto Rank, Heinz Kohut, and Julia Kristeva and theologically through liberal Protestant thinkers Friedrich Schleiermacher and Paul Tillich toward a Hindu-inspired Emersonian post-Christian nature spirituality. Ernst Bloch is another influence on Corrington.\n\nAs an alternative to contemporary metaphysical perspectives that are either too dependent upon a brute descriptive materialism on the one hand or to an honorific process cosmology on the other, ecstatic naturalism, like all versions of naturalism, assumes that nature is all there is; there is no recourse made to supernaturalistic forces or entities. For Corrington, however, ‘nature’ does not refer to anything, but is the dynamic entirety, an extremely wide and deeply vast reality that creates itself out of itself alone. In order to effectively speak or theorize about nature, then, Corrington has picked up on “a distinction dear to Averroes, Thomas of Aquinas, Baruch Spinoza, and Ralph Waldo Emerson (among others)” between natura naturans (nature naturing) and natura naturata (nature natured). (A Semiotic Theory p. 40) The perspective of ecstatic naturalism attempts to remain accountable to the insights of evolutionary sciences even as it probes ever deeper into those aspects of nature that elude strictly scientific inquiries. As a naturalist, Corrington is deeply suspicious of teleological descriptions of nature and finds in Arthur Schopenhauer’s ‘will to life’ a foundational ‘intention’ in organisms which anticipates Darwinian explanations of life’s perpetuation.\n\nRobert S. Corrington is the author of 12 books and 80 articles in the fields of philosophy, theosophy, theology, psychoanalysis, and semiotics as well as editor of several books on metaphysics and semiotics. He has also authored two plays.\n\n\nRobert S. Corrington has also contributed to numerous academic journals, e.g., \"International Philosophical Quarterly\", the \"American Journal of Semiotics, American Journal of Theology and Philosophy, Transactions of the C.S.

Bahro was a leader of the West German party The Greens, but became disenchanted with its political organization, left the party and explored spiritual approaches to sustainability.\n\nBahro was the eldest of three children of Max Bahro, a livestock-industry consultant, and Irmgard Bahro (née Conrad). Until 1945, the family lived in Lower Silesia: first in the spa town of Bad Flinsberg and then in neighboring Gerlachsheim, where Bahro attended the village school. Towards the end of World War II Max Bahro was drafted into the Volkssturm, and, after his capture, detained as a Polish prisoner. As the Eastern Front approached, the family was evacuated and Bahro was separated from his mother and siblings during the flight (the rest of Bahro's family, with the exception of his father, died of typhoid soon afterwards). Bahro lived with an aunt in Austria and Hesse, spending several months in each location and eventually reuniting with his father, who was managing a widow's farm in Rießen (now part of Siehdichum).\n\nFrom 1950 to 1954, Bahro attended high school in Fürstenberg (now part of Eisenhüttenstadt). Since it was assumed that all high-school students would join the Free German Youth (FDJ), Bahro reluctantly joined in 1950. This was, as he later commented, the only time he did something against his will under pressure. In 1952 he applied for membership in the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which he joined in 1954. Bahro was regarded as intelligent, and graduated from high school with honors. He attended Humboldt University in Berlin from 1954 to 1959 and studied philosophy. Among his teachers were Kurt Hager (who later became the philosopher of the SED), Georg Klaus and . The topic of his thesis was \"Johannes R. Becher and the relationship of the German working class and its party to the national question of our people\".\n\nUntil 1956, Bahro was an admirer of Lenin and Stalin; Khrushchev's leaked \"secret speech\" in February 1956 changed his views. He followed the Polish October and the Hungarian Revolution with great interest, expressed his solidarity with the insurgents in a wall newspaper and openly criticized the restricted-information policy of the GDR leadership. As a result of his views, national security spied on him for two years.\n\nAfter passing the government licensing examination, the SED sent Bahro to Sachsendorf (a part of Lindendorf). He edited a local newspaper, \"Die Linie\" (\"The Line\") and encouraged the area's farmers to join the LPG agricultural cooperative. In 1959 Bahro married Gundula Lambke, a Russian language teacher. The couple had two daughters (one of whom died at birth) and a son, in addition to Gundula's daughter. In 1960 Bahro was appointed to the party leadership of the University of Greifswald, where he founded the \"Unsere Universität\" (\"Our University\") newspaper and served as editor-in-chief. The same year saw the publication of his first book, a collection of poems entitled \"In dieser Richtung\" (\"In This Direction\"). Beginning in 1962, Bahro worked as a consultant for the Corporate Executive Committee of the Union of Science (one of the divisions of the Free German Trade Union Federation) in Berlin; in 1965 he was appointed deputy chief of the Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ) student magazine, \"Forum\". During Bahro's tenure with the FDJ he was hampered by conflict with the increasingly restrictive policies of the SED, which made him a target of criticism. Due to the unauthorized publication of an article by Volker Braun, Bahro was dismissed as deputy chief in 1967.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1977 Bahro worked for a number of companies in the rubber and plastics industry as an organization development specialist. Seeing conditions in the factories soon brought him to the conclusion that the East German economy was in a crisis and the primary reason for this was that workers had little voice in the workplace. He expressed this view in a December 1967 letter to the Chairman of the State Council, Walter Ulbricht, proposing a transfer of workplace responsibility to the workers with grassroots democracy. A few weeks later, the Prague Spring began; Bahro took a lively interest, supported the movement. In May 1968 he was interviewed by a member of the Central Committee, who made it clear that his solidarity with the \"counter-revolution\" was no longer tolerated. This led Bahro to develop his ideas systematically, and to publish them. His decision was reinforced by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 21. This was, as Bahro later said, \"the blackest day\" of his life and the reason for his final break with the SED. He decided not to make the break publicly, to protect his book project.\n\nIn 1972 Bahro began part-time work on his dissertation on development conditions of high-school and technical-college groups in the VEBs (state-owned enterprises of the GDR). At the same time, he secretly wrote a thematically broader manuscript which later became \"The Alternative\". In 1973, Gundula filed for divorce; both spouses said later this was as a precautionary measure to protect the children against government reprisals. However, in 1974 Gundula informed state security about the secret book project and handed over a copy of the manuscript; after that, Bahro was under surveillance.\n\nIn 1975 Bahro submitted his dissertation at the , which was evaluated favorably by three reviewers. The Stasi intervened, engineering two opposing reviews. His work on \"The Alternative\" was unhindered, but Bahro was convinced that he would be unable to disseminate his book to the GDR citizenry. In December 1976 he learned that one of his samizdats had fallen into Stasi hands, which prompted him to finish his work quickly. Intermediaries arranged a contract with Europäische Verlagsanstalt, a West German publisher. Swiss musicologist smuggled the finished manuscript into West Berlin, and copies of the manuscript reached individuals in the GDR by mail.\n\nLater in West Germany, Bahro said that the theoretical bases for \"The Alternative\" were Karl August Wittfogel's \"Oriental Despotism\" and earlier Marxist works. He was unable to cite Wittfogel because of the latter's anticommunism. Wittfogel also influenced Bahro's later ecological work.\n\n\"The Alternative\" is divided into three parts:\nThe introduction begins with the premise that the Communist movement did not lead to the theoretically expected situation, but instead continued on the capitalist path with only superficial changes. \"Alienation and the subaltern mentality of the working masses continue on a new level.\" The book analyzes the reasons for this, and offers solutions.\n\nThe first part is a historical analysis of the development of socialism in the Soviet Union. Bahro concludes that in the Soviet Union (and, consequently, also in countries such as the GDR) not the theoretically expected socialism but a form of proto-socialism had emerged. For the reason, he posits that at the time of the October Revolution the Soviet Union was far from the stage of development presumed in Marx's theory of history. Nevertheless, the path chosen by Lenin was correct. Bahro regards Stalin's subsequent massive industrialization as a necessary development, justifying the party purge as inevitable.\n\nIn the second part Bahro analyzes the existing social system, which he believes was incorrectly called \"real socialism\" when in reality it was still a class society. He detailed how this society worked, and argues that this provided the rationale for the observed economic stagnation.\n\nIn the third part he developed solutions, including a call for a new revolution which would transform not only the social circumstances but the people. Its intention is to overcome the subaltern mentality, the \"form of existence and way of thinking of ordinary people.\" He demanded the abolition of the division of labor; all should participate in science, art and menial work.\n\nOn 22 August 1977 the West German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" published an extract from \"The Alternative\" and an interview with Bahro, during which he admitted writing the book. The next day, Bahro was arrested and taken to the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen prison. That evening, West German television stations ARD and ZDF broadcast Bahro's interview.\n\nIn early September, the book went on sale. The first edition was sold out before delivery, and was translated into other languages. \"The Alternative\" sparked debate in the West European left about the nature of socialism. For Herbert Marcuse, Bahro's book was \"the most important contribution to Marxist theory and practice that has appeared in recent decades\"; a similar view was expressed by the Trotskyist Ernest Mandel. To Lawrence Krader, Bahro was the \"conscience of the revolution, the strength of the truth\". Rudi Dutschke was critical, classifying Bahro as detached from Leninism with too little respect for human rights and calling his suggestions \"totally unrealistic\".\n\nThese analyses were accompanied by a broad wave of publicly expressed solidarity with Bahro, climaxing in a letter by Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass in \"The Times\" on 1 February 1978 which was also signed by Arthur Miller, Graham Greene, Carol Stern, Mikis Theodorakis and other celebrities. In the GDR, however, Bahro's recognition was suppressed and he was told nothing of the reaction to his book and subsequent arrest. About half of the copies of \"The Alternative\" which Bahro had posted shortly before his arrest in the GDR were intercepted by the authorities. His influence of East German students was limited.\n\nTo write and publish a book was, in itself, legal in the GDR; however, Bahro was accused of working for the West German intelligence service (from whom he was thought to have obtained his information). On 30 June 1978 Bahro was convicted \"in camera\" of treason and betraying state secrets, and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Evidence indicates a kangaroo court, with a predetermined verdict; an appeal to the Supreme Court of the GDR filed by defense attorney Gregor Gysi was summarily rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe verdict immediately sparked violent protests and expressions of solidarity in the West. The Committee for the Release of Rudolf Bahro organized an international conference, held 16 to 19 November 1978 in West Berlin and attended by over 2,000 participants. The depth of solidarity is illustrated by an appeal to the State Council of the GDR in the \"Frankfurter Rundschau\" of 11 May 1979, organized by Bahro Committee in 12 countries and signed by a number of celebrities. Bahro was awarded the Carl von Ossietzky Medal by the International League for Human Rights and made a member of the Swedish and Danish chapters of PEN International.\n\nOn 11 October 1979, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, Bahro was granted amnesty. On 17 October he was deported with his former wife, their two children and his partner Ursula Beneke to the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with his July request.\n\nIn West Germany Bahro soon joined the nascent Greens party, making a commitment to unite socialist and currents in the new party since compromise was a necessity. A 1980 book formulated elements of a new policy: the relationship between ecology and socialism. Breaking from his position in \"The Alternative\", Bahro now felt that classical Marxism was no longer appropriate.\n\nAnother new motif in Bahro's thinking was religion. While in custody he had studied the Bible, and when he moved to the west he noticed unhappiness in spite of material prosperity. He interpreted this as a lack of introspection and transcendence, rejecting the traditionally materialistic outlook of socialism. The goal of human emancipation, represented (in different ways) by Karl Marx and Jesus Christ. In this context, Bahro referred to early Christianity and liberation theology.\n\nAt the beginning of 1980, Bahro studied with Oskar Negt at the University of Hanover. His thesis appeared as a book, \"A Plea for Creative Initiative\". In 1983, he earned his habilitation in social philosophy.\n\nIn 1982, Bahro adopted a more radical position due to the contemporary economic crisis. He advocated a restructuring of society in economic, environmental and social-policy terms, which should be linked to a broad retreat from the world market and a move away from capitalist industry. Bahro also became involved in the peace movement, advocating a nuclear-free Europe.\n\nBahro's Dare Commune was an alternative community during the early days of the Greens. He believed that the transformation of society must begin on a small scale, requiring a change in the people themselves and a rediscovery of spirituality. Bahro was influenced by the Congregation of the Benedictines and the mystical experience of God.\n\nIn 1981 Bahro visited the Korean People's Democratic Republic, where he was received as a guest of the state. He saw this as his most important trip, to a state he admired with a system \"to satisfy all the basic requirements of security\". As part of a lecture tour of the United States in summer 1983, Bahro enjoyed several weeks at Rajneeshpuram with Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho).\n\nAfter the Green Party entered the Bundestag for the first time in March 1983, the question arose whether they would join a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (the SPD) or remain in opposition. Bahro strongly favored the latter option (which placed him in opposition to Joschka Fischer), and believed in renewal rather than reform. In his December 1984 \"Hamburg speech\", Bahro made a comparison with the political and social situation in the Weimar Republic: At that time, there had also been a broad movement in society which was dissatisfied with prevailing conditions and wanted change. What mattered now was to prevent the errors and political disasters of the past. In the Weimar Republic, the \"brown\" pole of the political spectrum (the Nazis) overpowered the left with \"nationalist mythology in disguise; therefore, resistance to capitalist development\" could not begin. Bahro's \"popular uprising\" could occur this time without violence, but it was important that the Greens \"are not lost\" in the system. Bahro also called for the conquest of the right-left divide; to escape its minority position, the Greens should also \"penetrate the territory of the Bavarian CSU\". Bahro's Hamburg speech ended with the allegation that Joschka Fischer's supporters had a lust for power, a situation that could lead to civil war and subsequent dictatorship.\n\nDuring the summer of 1985 Bahro left the Greens and focused on his new book, which was published in 1987 as \"Logic of Salvation\". In it he described a \"logic of self-extermination\" and its consequences for humanity at present, presenting a \"logic of life\" requiring a \"leap in consciousness\" and a withdrawal from the industrial \"mega-machine\". It was important to implement a \"rescue policy\", before the worsening environmental crisis leads to an emergency government. Bahro called for long-term goals, the elimination of short-term tactics and government decentralization. He advocated an \"invisible church\", which would provide the necessary spiritual dimension. As a conservative on the left, he noted common ground with CDU politician and critic Kurt Biedenkopf. Inspired by Mikhail Gorbachev's \"perestroika\", Bahro hoped for a \"prince of environmental change\" and suggested the establishment of a consensus-oriented body similar to the British House of Lords. The book met a mostly negative response, and Bahro's references to a prince and an invisible church were criticized.\n\nIn 1986, Bahro held \"learning workshops\" at his home in Worms, which featured discussion of his ideas and meditation. He met Beatrice Ingermann, who had been conducting a similar project since 1983 that was also a community in the Eifel. Bahro joined her group; they married in 1988, and had a daughter.\n\nSeeing the rapid decline of the GDR, at the end of 1989 Bahro went to East Berlin to fight against the feared \"sellout of the GDR,\" its absorption by the Federal Republic. He wanted to work to ensure that the regime could keep its autonomy and maintain what he thought was its greatest political achievement: the primacy of politics over economics.\n\nOn 16 December 1989, Bahro had the opportunity of speaking to the assembled delegates of the extraordinary party conference of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, whose chairman had, a week ago, been his former legal counsel, Gysi. The main item on the agenda was whether the party should continue or be dissolved. What was finally decided was that the party should continue under a new name: Socialist Unity Party of Germany – Party of Democratic Socialism (German: Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands – Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus, abbreviated SED-PDS). Bahro's request to address the conference as a guest speaker found only a slight majority (54%), and he was granted only 30 minutes, not the requested 45 minutes. Bahro was annoyed at this and had to improvise. After reading out the names of all the people who had helped him with his book, \"Die Alternative\", he criticized the previous speaker, Minister President and Deputy Party Chairman Hans Modrow, as well as Karl Marx, Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. He went on to present his vision of a \"socio- ecological\" restructuring of the GDR. His radical environmental ideas, which were hardly known in the GDR at that time, were far removed from the problems that interested the delegates, and his polemical introduction provoked fierce resentment. Bahro concluded that he no longer had anything in common with this party.\n\nIn the spring of 1990, he began setting up an \"Institute for Social Ecology\" at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Instead of the usual discussion of the ecological crisis, he wanted this institute to address the issue holistically and, above all, study the deeper social and cultural causes of the crisis and develop practical alternatives. Bahro thus set up his own school of social science that is not to be confused with others that also go by the name of social ecology.\n\nOn 16 June 1990, again represented by Gysi, Bahro was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the GDR. On 15 September, shortly before the end of the GDR, the Minister of Education and Science appointed him associate professor of social ecology at Humboldt University. From the winter semester 1990/1991, Bahro regularly held lectures on issues of the environmental crisis, where he further developed the theories that he had put forward in his book \"Logik der Rettung\" (published in English as \"Avoiding social and ecological disaster: the politics of world transformation: an inquiry into the foundations of spiritual and ecological politics\"). The lectures, to which he frequently invited guest speakers, were aimed at students in all years and also attracted an audience from outside the university. In the first years, the main lecture hall (\"auditorium maximum\") of the university was consistently full, and this also resulted in increased sales of his book on which the lectures were based. However, the Institute remained a temporary arrangement that could only exist thanks to financial support from the Schweisfurth Foundation. It was not until 1995 that the institute was integrated into the university as a working group of the Faculty of Agriculture and Horticulture.\n\nIn 1990, there were accusations that Bahro was striving for \"eco-dictatorship\". This accusation was made particularly aggressively by the \"Association for the Advancement of Psychological Knowledge of Human Nature\", an organization founded in Zurich which, in a work entitled \"The Fascism of the New Left\", claimed that Bahro's real goal was an \"eco-fascist dictatorship\". Bahro indignantly denied this but soon found himself confronted with more accusations of this nature. The accusations were based on quotations from his book \"Logik der Rettung\". In 1992, a former party colleague of his, Jutta Ditfurth joined the debate when, in her book \"Feuer in die Herzen\" [Putting Fire in the Hearts], she accused him of turning to esoteric, authoritarian and nationalist ideas.\n\nIn addition to his activities in Berlin, until 1991 Bahro also active in the \"Lernwerkstatt\" [Learning Workshop] a non-profit organization in Niederstadtfeld, and he planned similar experiments with new sustainable living and economic systems in the former GDR. A conversation with the Minister-President of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, in the summer of 1991 led to the socio-ecological futurology project \"LebensGut\" in the village of Pommritz, near Bautzen. There, the socio-ecological research begun at the Humboldt University is also being continued, mainly by Bahro's former associate Maik Hosang.\n\nIn September 1993, Bahro's wife Beatrice committed suicide following a marital dispute. He was so devastated that he had to cancel a semester of lectures. In the spring of 1994, he also became physically ill and in the autumn of that year he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer. Bahro was convinced that his illness was the consequence of traumatic experiences such as the suicide of his wife and resisted conventional therapy, instead trying various alternative methods of diagnosis and therapy and temporarily moving into a monastery. Only after his condition deteriorated dramatically did he agree to another course of chemotherapy. In May 1995, on his sickbed, he married his girlfriend and companion Marina Lehnert, who had been caring for his daughter for some time.\n\nAfter a year's break due to illness, in summer 1996 Bahro resumed teaching, but only to a limited extent. He gave his last lecture in July 1997. After that, he caught pneumonia and the cancer broke out again.\n\nRudolf Bahro died in Berlin on 5 December 1997 and was buried at the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in Berlin.\n\nSome years after Bahro's death, suspicions were raised that his cancer and that of two other former political prisoners may have been caused by secret irradiation during detention.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40024758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40024758", "title": "Sara Riel", "text": "Sara Riel\n\nSara Riel (October 11, 1848 – December 27, 1883) was the first Métis Grey Nun from Red River. She was a highly educated and active member of the Catholic Church. She is best known as the sister of Métis leader Louis Riel. Born in 1848 in the Red River settlement to parents Jean-Louis Riel and Julie (Lagimodière) Riel, as a young child she was surrounded by the word of God, being educated by Sisters of Charity of Montreal but also by her mother, who was dedicated to the Christian faith. She was inspired to become a nun after her brother Louis Riel entered the seminary to become a priest. Although Louis did not become a priest, Sara actively took her Solemn vows in 1868. She taught languages and arts at the Grey Nuns boarding schools between 1868 and 1871, after which she became a Catholic missionary. Her family were active members in the Red River community right up to the Métis resistance. Although separated from her family, her writings showed a sympathetic view on the eve of the resistance. Given that her brother was an active member in leading the revolution against the government, in 1869 the congregation feared for her safety and she was moved several times within a few years. Even though she took no active part in the cause, she provided support to her brother and a voice to the Métis of the local Catholic Churches. In 1871 she became the first Métis missionary from Red River and set off for Île-à-la-Crosse in northern Saskatchewan. In 1872 Sara Riel was taken ill and almost died, after a vision from God, Sara Riel changed her name to ‘Sister Marguerite-Marie of Alacoque’ and re-honored her vows and commitment to the Catholic Church. Sara actively wrote to her family telling them of her experiences, wishes, and hopes for them. She died of tuberculosis in 1884 at the age of 35.\n\nSara Riel was born on October 11, 1848 in Red River, a small community settled originally through the fur trade and later expanded by the colonization of Lord Selkirk. Red River was a secluded place in the 1850s. It could only be reached by water, leaving it almost impossible to reach in the winter. The North West Company’s fur trade was the primary economic resource of the region. There were large alliances formed between the trader and the indigenous people. They taught each other important aspect of survival and adaptation with the buffalo hunt, agriculture, and medicine. Red River eventually became a place where retired fur traders could live with their families. The new culture created in the settlement produced a generation of half settlers, half indigenous children known as the Métis, who created their own unique culture.\n\nSara Riel's father was Jean-Louis Riel born in 1817, he was a voyageur for the North West Company. He was the 5th generation settler. His background was that of a French-Canadian. In Red River, Jean-Louis Riel became a very important person within the growing Métis community. Jean-Louis Riel taught his children to be proud of their Métis heritage and to embrace their culture. He himself led many Métis revolts, including the one surrounding the Sayer Trial in 1849.\n\nSara and Louis Riel’s mother, Julie (Lagimodière) Riel was born in 1822 in French River. She was also from a French background that integrated with the Métis culture and passed on their traditions to their children. Prior to marriage, Julie Lagimodière was planning to join the Grey Nuns. Her parents chose the marriage to Jean-Louis Riel as a sense of financial and social security for their loving daughter.\n\nSara Riel was the fourth child born to Jean-Louis and Julie Riel. The first born was Louis, followed by two children who did not make it past birth. Sara was the next child born. This dynamic left a special bond between Louis and Sara as the two eldest children of the family. Altogether the Riel family consisted of 11 children but only 8 lived to adulthood. The Riel family were members of the Red River elite and the children lived a more privileged life, very close to the Catholic Church, receiving the best education Red River had to offer. From the mid1840's till the late 1880s, the family went through hard economic times and had to sacrifice their prior way of living.\n\nEducation was important to the Riel family and was taken very seriously by Julie Riel, whom herself wanted to join the sisterhood prior to marriage. She taught her children the ways of the Catholic Church and to love God in their actions.\n\nSara Riel was educated by the Sisters of Charity boarding school in St. Boniface. She excelled in many subjects including languages, art, and music. But she also learned household skills such as cooking and cleaning along with spin, knit, sewing, and embroidering. The Grey Nuns believed that orderliness and cleanliness of Métis were a representation of the schooling provided by the Church, therefore they encouraged the young girls to perfect their skills in household chores.\n\nShe attended school in St. Boniface from 1858 until 1866 when she was chosen to join the Grey Nuns. She entered the congregation in 1866. In 1868 she became the first Métis Grey Nun from Red River. She was skilled in many languages including French, English, Michif, and Cree. The church saw her as ideal to become a teacher but also a mediator between; the missionaries and the aboriginal people. Also between the aboriginal woman, the church, and the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nAfter the death of her father in 1864, Louis became the head of the family therefor responsible for his mother and younger siblings including Sara Riel. He and the rest of the children were forced to quit school to help with agriculture and sustaining the family home. Sara Riel was the only one who was allowed to stay in school and fulfill her mission as a nun.\n\nThe Riel family was very dedicated to the education of their children. Their mother was especially dedicated to the church and instilled the will of God into her children. The family found themselves very close to Alexandre-Antonin Taché who was the head of the Catholic church in St. Boniface. It was through him that Sara Riel learned of the missionaries and Louis Riel was chosen to study for the priesthood. Louis Riel left school in 1865, abandoning all wishes to join the church. He did not return home from Montreal until after his father's death.\n\nFollowing in her loving brother's footsteps Sara Riel was accepted to the Grey Nuns as a novice in 1866. Two years later in 1868, Sara Riel took her vows and joined the Catholic community. At this time, Red River had just 26 sisters serving as missionaries. Many of which came from Quebec, who helped provide a better education for the country born children and Métis.\n\nOn the 22nd of June 1871, Sister Riel left for the mission of Ile-a-La-Crosse now in northern Saskatchewan. Le Métis (a local Red River newspaper) reported: “Sister Riel, Sister of Mr. Louis Riel, however, had been designated to accompany her (Sister Charlebois), she is believed the first missionary from the Métis nation of Red River, given to this Great Apostolic work, and one could not find a more dignified person. a kind heart, keen intelligence, and inexhaustible charity distinguished this new missionary, her departure is a sacrifice for her family and the entire population, but at the same time it is an honor and a blessing for us”.\n\nThe first Métis resistance happened between 1869-1870. This happened following the establishment of the Canadian government and first signs of surveyors on the Métis land. The Hudson Bay Company sold Rupert’s Land to the Canadian Government without thinking about the people who occupied it or had claims over it. Louis Riel and the other Métis believed that the creation of the Canadian state was not only a political issue but also a religious and cultural one. With determination to preserve their way of life the Métis people took arms. After stopping surveyors, the Métis of Red River formed a provisional government. At the head of the provisional government was Louis Riel.\n\nDuring the conflict, the Métis took Fort Gary and executed Thomas Scott. This forced the Canadian government to acknowledge the people who lived on the land. This uprising created the province known as Manitoba. With Sara and Louis Riel's close relationship and tensions rising between the Métis and the government, the congregation had to take special precaution with Sara Riel.\n\nBy 1869 the congregation feared for Sister Riel’s safety. With the rebellion unfolding, she was moved back to St.Boniface. Sara Riel was not impressed by the choice to move her. When Sara learned that she would have to perform manual and domestic duties, she saw that as a demotion to all the hard work she had done. Sister Riel wrote in one of her letters: “The annual autumn changes took place today on the 20th. my mission to St.Norber is over. The order placed me in the day school. I must also mend and was the community linen-- a job that occupies me continuously without fatigues”\n\nWith all the stress and chaos that the rebellion brought at home, Sister Riel still wrote actively to her brother. In the many letters sent, Sara Riel repeatedly told her brother to stay strong and fight for what they both believed in. In September 1868, she wrote: “Louis, chase away the sad and troubling thoughts to which our last meeting gave birth. Which time and the grace of God, the darkness of the present will disappear. Be confident! until then, we must do out duties. You as a fervent Christian and me as a sister of charity”\n\nWhen Louis Riel was in exile to Saint-Joseph, Detroit after the first uprising, Sara Riel wrote several letters to Louis showing confidence, love and vital information that may have played a role in the future of the cause. She wrote; “truthfully I believe it would be an insult to God if I doubted for only a second the complete success of our cause ... remember last winter when everything seemed over. It was God’s will that you should be overthrown, it overthrew in order to better your success” In another letter she sent she described the heartache felt by the Métis following his departure. She wrote: <nowiki>\"</nowiki> Louis let us bury our sorrows in the wounds of his (God) sacred heart...to love and pray, these are the arms with which we must fight to vanquish the conqueror<nowiki>\"</nowiki>.\n\nThroughout the exile, Sister Riel and Mgr Taché knew of Louis Riel's whereabouts and even helped him with news and information of Canadian politics. This is about the same time that Sara Riel chose to exile herself. But like the letters to Louis Riel, they both had to wait until the time was right.This was a hard time for Sara Riel, she prayed for her brother's health and safety.\n\nFollowing the resistance, the people of Red River elected Louis Riel to a seat in Parliament in 1873 but he was a wanted man in Canada. The Canadian Government wanted him for the murder of Scott, which prevented him from taking his seat and delayed his return to Red River. The last Métis resistance occurred in 1885, one year after the death of Sara Riel.\n\nSara Riel was often mentioned in the writings and correspondence of the Gray Nuns. She was a very active, important and hardworking member of the clergy, who was often recognized for her actions.\n\nIn 1872 Sister Riel was taken ill and almost died one day after choir practice. After a miraculous recovery, she claimed to have been saved by God and her faith was solidified. She changed her name to that of a great saint: “Marguerite-Marie of Alacoque” after a vision from God.\n\nIn the 1880s her health began to decline. Sara Riel suffered from tuberculosis for many years. When her health became very serious she was given permission to return to Red River, to be with her family in her final days. Sister Riel refused the offer. She was determined that her mission was to Île-à-la-Cross and would stay until the end.\n\nSara Riel died December 27, 1883 at the age of 35. She served the Catholic Church as a Nun for just over 17years, either as a teacher, a translator or a missionary. The chronicles from Île-à-la-Cross described her last moments as ones of suffering and difficulties. One of her final letters was addressed to her brother, Louis Riel. She claimed her love for him, she reminded him to be strong and to remain dedicated to God in all his actions.\n\nOn April 27, 1885, the day after the Green Lake Post was looted during the North-West Rebellion, the Grey Nuns of Île-à-la-Crosse were terrified that Louis Riel, who had accused them of letting his younger sister die in misery would seek revenge. They fled the village along with most of the personnel and dependents of the Hudson's Bay Company Post and the Roman Catholic Mission. The large group camped on a small wooded island north of Patuanak until the crisis was over and returned to Île-à-la-Crosse on May 29, 1885.\n\nToday, Sara Riel is not talked about as much as her brother. The Riel family home still stands in Red River and has become a historical site in the province of Manitoba. It is referred to as the birthplace of the Métis resistance.\n\nSara Riel is seen as an important figure in the history of the Métis woman, of Red River and in the Catholic Missionary. She was an active writer which left a larger paper trail allowing historians and scholars an insight into her life, family and the people at the time of the resistance. Although in the 1970<nowiki>'s Sara was looked at in a more negative way, she was declared \" a pale representation of her brother\"</nowiki> her letter left important information in Canadian History, allowing an alternate view into many aspects of life of the 1800s.\n"}
{"id": "12449058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12449058", "title": "Shuah", "text": "Shuah\n\nShuah () is the name of one of four minor Biblical figures. It is sometimes used as the name of a fifth. Their names are different in Hebrew, but they were all transliterated as \"Shuah\" in the King James Version.\n\nShuah (Hebrew: שׁוּחַ, pronounced \"Shuakh\", \"ditch; swimming; humiliation\" or \"sinks down\") was the sixth son of Abraham (the patriarch of the Israelites) and Keturah, whom Abraham had wed after the death of Sarah. He was the youngest of Keturah's sons; the others were Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, and Ishbak.\n\nShuah in Greek is Σωυε, transliterated Soie. Josephus gave his name as Σοῦος (Sous in Whiston).\n\nJosephus writes of the brothers that \"Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of Arabia Felix, as far as it reaches to the Red Sea.\" It is a traditional view among believers in the story that Abraham tried to keep his other sons apart from Isaac to avoid conflict. But unlike his brothers, Shuah seems to have turned northward and travelled into northern Mesopotamia, in what is now the northern region of modern-day Syria. As evidenced by cuneiform texts, the land seems to have been named after him, being known as the land of \"Sûchu\" which lies to the south of ancient Hittite capital of Carchemish on the Euphrates river.\n\nThe Bible also records that Job's friend Bildad was a \"Shuhite\".\n\nShuah or Shua (Hebrew: שׁוּעַ, pronounced \"Shuaʿ\", with an ayin glottal stop at the end, \"opulence\" or \"cry for help\") was a certain Caananite, whose unnamed daughter marries Judah. He was thereby also the grandfather of Er, Onan, Shelah.\n\nThe Targum translates \"Canaanite man\" as \"merchant\", and Rashi refers to this. In the Talmud, \"Pesachim\" 50a, there is a discussion explaining this translation.\n\nIn the King James Version, Genesis 38:2 reads \"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah ...\" This is ambiguous as to who is named Shuah, the Canaanite or his daughter. This has led some to say that Shuah was Judah's wife.\n\nShuah in Greek is Σαυα, transliterated Sava. The Septuagint is explicit that Sava is the daughter of the Canaanite man and the wife of Judah.\n\nThe reference to Judah's wife in Genesis 38:12 refers to her as the \"daughter of Shuah\", or \"bat-Shuah\" in Hebrew. This has led some to take Bat-Shuah (and variants) as her actual name. A midrashic tradition says her name was Aliyath. Bat-Shuah is also an alternative name for Bat-Sheva, wife of Judah's descendant, King David.\n\nShuah or Shuhah (Hebrew: שׁוּחָה, pronounced \"Shukhah\") is a descendant of Judah. No gender or father is named, just a brother Chelub and his descendants. Ralbag in his commentary says that Shuhah is the same as Hushah (חוּשָׁה) listed earlier in the genealogy. Nave says Shuhah is \"probably the same\" as Hushah.\n\nShuah in Greek is ᾿Ασχὰ, transliterated Ascha. The Septuagint states that Chaleb is Ascha's father.\n\nShuah or Shua (Hebrew: שׁוּעָא, pronounced \"Shuʿa\", with an ayin glottal stop in the middle, \"wealth\") was a great-granddaughter of Asher. She was the daughter of Heber, who was a son of Beriah, a son of Asher. Her brothers were Japhlet, Shomer, and Hotham.\n\nShuah in Greek is Σωλὰ, transliterated Sola.\n"}
{"id": "22918930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22918930", "title": "Solomon Eliezer Alfandari", "text": "Solomon Eliezer Alfandari\n\nSolomon Eliezer Alfandari () ( 1826 – 1930), also known as the Saba Kadisha (\"Holy Grandfather\"), was a distinguished rabbi, kabbalist and rosh yeshiva in his native home of Constantinople, and later served as Chief Rabbi of Damascus, Syria Vilayet, and Safed, Beirut Vilayet. He was known for his stringent interpretation of halakha and his uncompromising dedication to Orthodox Judaism.\n\nThe Saba Kadisha was born in Ottoman-controlled Constantinople around 1826 (some say as early as 1820) to a distinguished family of Torah scholars. His father, Yaakov, was a Talmudic scholar; his grandfather, Rabbi Ḥayyim ben Yaakov Alfandari, authored \"Maggid MiReishit\", and his great-grandfather, Rabbi Yaakov ben Ḥayyim Alfandari, authored \"Mutzal MiEish\". His mother, Chana, also came from an illustrious family.\n\nAs a youth, Solomon Eliezer was noted for his sharp understanding of Torah subjects. Yet he refused to accept a rabbinical position or to wear the customary dress of the city's sages. He did agree to join the Vaad Haruchani (Spiritual Council) of Constantinople, and accepted the position of rosh yeshiva in a yeshiva which the city's Jews founded for him. In the latter post, he taught many outstanding scholars, including Rabbi Chaim Hezekiah Medini, later known as the Sdei Chemed.\n\nRabbi Solomon Eliezer displayed his willingness to take a firm stand in a highly charged political situation which found him challenging the views of his entire community.\n\nThe issue at hand was the drafting of Jewish soldiers into the sultan's army, a decree fraught with spiritual peril. Originally, the Jews who had fled the Spanish Inquisition to the Ottoman Empire were exempted from the army by the sultan. In Rabbi Solomon Eliezer's day, however, a new sultan, Abdul Hamid II, decreed that all non-Muslims must enlist.\n\nThe city's rabbis tried to reverse the edict, without success. Eventually they decided to accept the decree rather than provoke the authorities. The Vaad Haruchani issued a directive urging the region's Jews to go ahead and enlist.\n\nRabbi Solomon Eliezer was the only one who protested this course of action. At the Vaad meeting, he declared, \"Since serving in the Turkish army involves Shabbat desecration and the defiling of oneself with nonkosher food, enlisting in the army is considered a \"Chillul Hashem\". We must not yield to Sultan Abdul Hamid. If we are firm, Hashem will help us.\" After this declaration, he burst into tears.\n\nOne of the community's wealthy members had some influence in the sultan's court. Yet this Jew, too, backed the draft decree. One day, as this man visited the palace to oversee certain aspects of the decree, he fell unconscious and died.\n\nThe next day, a huge gathering assembled at the wealthy man's funeral. At that time, it was customary for Rabbi Solomon Eliezer to deliver the first eulogy at every funeral, and no one dared precede him. But today, Rabbi Solomon Eliezer stayed home. Community representatives came to plead with him to speak, or at least to let others speak without him, but he refused. The sons of the wealthy man came to offer him a large sum of money which he could use for tzedaka, but still he refused. \"Yesterday I visited your father and asked him not to collaborate with the sultan,\" the rabbi explained. \"But he defied me. Therefore, I cannot honor him.\"\n\nIn the end, none of the city's rabbis eulogized the man.\n\nSultan Abdul Hamid was furious when he heard about Rabbi Solomon Eliezer's efforts to cancel the draft decree. He summoned the rabbi to the palace, intending to punish him for inciting the Jews against him. But when the sultan met the rabbi and heard his position, he was very impressed with him. He even granted him the title of Hakham Bashi, with the power to issue edicts in the Jewish community.\n\nIn the end, the draft was not enforced due to internal conflicts in the royal court.\n\nIn 1897, the Saba Kadisha decided to leave Constantinople to accept the position of Chief Rabbi of Damascus. Here he founded a yeshiva which produced dozens of students who served as rabbis and \"dayanim\" in Sephardic communities in the region.\n\nIn 1904, at almost 90 years of age, he immigrated to Palestine. At first he lived for several years in the city of Haifa, but then accepted the invitation of the Torah leaders of Safed to serve as their Chief Rabbi, a position he held until 1918.\n\nThe story is told that when Rabbi Solomon Eliezer went outside to bless the new moon with his congregants at the beginning of the month of Nisan 5674 (April 1914), he looked up after completing the blessings, clapped his hands and cried loudly. He explained, \"I see that a large-scale war will soon break out.\" Four months later, World War I began.\n\nRabbi Solomon Eliezer was able to relieve the water and food shortages faced by the Jews of Safed during World War I as a result of another encounter with a Turkish official. This time, a Turkish pasha came to the city riding a white horse and dressed in a flashy uniform, with a retinue of Turkish soldiers. When the Saba Kadisha came out to greet him, the pasha was impressed by the rabbi's distinguished appearance, and asked him for a blessing.\n\n\"Only the humble can receive blessings,\" the rabbi replied. \"I will bless you after you come down from your horse.\"\n\nThe pasha complied, and the rabbi blessed him: \"May God help you in your efforts to see to the needs of the oppressed Jewish nation.\" As a result of that encounter, the pasha did arrange for food and water to be supplied to Safed's Jewish residents.\"\n\nIn 1918, rabbi Yisroel Ber Odesser, a Breslover Hasid, became a personal attendant to rabbi Solomon Eliezer, who was living in Tiberias at the time. After seeing Odesser recite \"Tikkun Chatzot\" one night, however, the Saba Kadisha refused to let him attend him anymore, and instead treated him as a young colleague.\n\nIn his final years, Alfandari suffered many ailments, for which he sought medical treatment in Jerusalem. Although he tried to travel incognito, many Torah leaders desired to meet him when they found out he was in their city. One of these \"gedolim\" was Rabbi Ezra Attiya, who later became rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef Yeshiva. The Saba Kadisha held Rabbi Attiya in high esteem, and would always stand up for him when he visited.\n\nIn 1925, Alfandari developed a serious illness while in Tiberias. He refused to be treated in the local hospital, where the rules of \"tzniut\" (modesty) were not meticulously observed, and was taken to Shaarei Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem instead. After he recovered, Jerusalem's sages begged him to stay in their city. He rented an apartment in the Ruchama neighborhood (today Mekor Baruch).\n\nHere he hosted meetings with many prominent Torah scholars who came to consult with him and speak with him in learning. These included: Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank, Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem; Rabbi Velvel Mintzberg, leader of the Ashkenazi community in the Old Yishuv; Rabbi Avraham Weinberg of Slonim, author of \"Birkas Avraham\"; and Rabbi Yitzchak Abuchatzeira, brother of the Baba Sali and a Torah sage in his own right. Shortly before the Saba Kadisha's death, the Munkatcher Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira, of Hungary made a special trip to meet him. Theirs was considered an historic meeting between two worlds, the Sephardi genius of the Middle East and the Hasidic tradition of Eastern Europe.\n\nAlfandari contracted pneumonia in May 1930 and was treated by Dr. Moshe Wallach of Shaarei Tzedek Hospital. His disease worsened, however, and he died on 20 May 1930 (22 Iyar 5690). His funeral was attended by thousands, as his students carried his casket on foot from his home all the way to the Mount of Olives. He was nearly 110 years old.\n\nThe street on which Alfandari lived in Jerusalem was named in his memory.\n\nHe forbade the shaving of beards, even using scissors or depilatory cream. He even refused to speak with a \"talmid chacham\" who did not have a beard, even if the discussion concerned the Talmud.\n\nDuring his move from Syria to Palestine, the Saba Kadisha stopped off in Beirut, where many questions were addressed to him regarding \"shmita\" (the laws of the Sabbatical year). His responses indicate that he strongly opposed the \"heter mechira\" which Israel's Chief Rabbinate had adopted to spare its farmers from loss.\nRabbi Solomon Eliezer was a strong opponent of the Zionist Nationalist Council (Vaad Haleumi), which, in British Mandate Palestine, automatically enlisted all Jews, unless they opted out. Rav Alfandari signed legal rulings obligating every Jew to opt out.\n\nAll of rabbi Solomon Eliezer's responsa and halakhic rulings were published posthumously. These include:\n\n\nHis letters were collected in \"Masos Yerushalayim\", \"Kumi Roni\" and \"Amudei Arazim\".\n\n"}

According to Muvekkit Hadžihuseinović he was born in Lušci Palanka, in the Bosanska Krajina region, however, according to his nickname \"Hersekli\", he was from Herzegovina. The birthplace has been given specifically as Bijela Rudina, Bileća.\n\nAn Ottoman sultan wrote in a book that he had requested from a notable lord in Herzegovina, named Predojević, that 30 small Serb children (including Predojević's only son Jovan, and his nephew Nikola) to be sent to Ottoman service (see devshirme). The very young Nikola was then taken to Constantinople as \"acem-i oğlan\" (foreign child) and brought up in the Sultan's court, converting to Islam, adopting the name Hasan and advancing to the post of \"çakircibaşa\" (chief falconer and commander of falconers in the Sultan's court).\n\nAfter having been appointed Beglerbeg of Bosnia, Telli Hasan Pasha had the Rmanj Monastery renewed as a seat of his brother, Serbian Orthodox monk Gavrilo Predojević. He also founded a mosque in Polje, Grabovica, in the Bileća municipality.\n\nDuring the rule of Murat III (1574–1595) he became Sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Segedin, where he stayed until June 1591.\n\nHe was elevated and appointed Beglerbeg (Governor-General) of the Bosnia Eyalet in 1591. A bellicose and dynamic military leader, Hasan strengthened the army of the Eyalet equipping it with better horses and erecting a bridge at Gradiška with the purpose of easier maneuvering between Bosnia and Slavonia.\nIn August 1591, without a declaration of war, Hasan Pasha attacked Habsburg Croatia and reached Sisak, but was repelled after 4 days of fighting. Thomas Erdődy, the Ban of Croatia, launched a counterattack and seized much of the Moslavina region. The same year Hasan Pasha launched another attack, taking the town of Ripač on the Una River. These raids forced the Ban to declare a general uprising to defend the country in late January, 1592. These actions of the Ottoman regional forces under Hasan Pasha seem to have been contrary to the interest and policy of the central Ottoman administration in Constantinople, and due rather to aims of conquest and organized plundering by the war-like Bosnian \"sipahi\", although perhaps also under the pretext of putting an end to Uskok (Balkan Habsburg-sided pirates and bandits engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Ottomans) raids into the Eyalet; since the two realms had signed a nine-year peace treaty earlier in 1590. Hasan Pasha's forces of approximately 20,000 janissaries continued to raid the region, with the goal of seizing the strategically important town of Senj and its port, and to eliminate the Uskoci as well; because of all this, the Holy Roman Emperor sent his ambassador so he would beg that Hasan Pasha be removed from his post, or otherwise an end would be put to the existing truce. The ambassador was told in reply, that it belonged to the Grand Vizier and to Derviš-paša, the Sultan's favourite, to repel their aggressions against the Ottoman Empire; that, the imperial ambassador was told, was a sufficient answer. After learning this, Hasan Pasha felt himself encouraged enough to lead his forces towards Bihać, which was conquered on June 19, 1592 after eight days of siege, along with several surrounding forts. Records show that nearly 2,000 people died in defense of the town, and an estimated 800 children were taken for Ottoman servitude (see devshirme), \nto be educated in Islam and become janissaries, as Hasan had been himself. After having placed a sufficient garrison in Bihać, he erected two other fortresses in its vicinity; the command of which he conferred to Rustem-beg, who was the leader of the Grand Vizier Ferhad Pasha's militia. In all, during this two-year campaign, the Ottoman Bosnian regional invading forces, led by Hasan Pasha, burned to the ground 26 cities throughout the Croatian Frontier and took some 35,000 war captives. At the same time, at Predojević's order, Orthodox Serbs were settled in the \"whole region around Bihać\" from 1592 to 1593, while Orthodox Vlachs from Eastern Herzegovina, and with them some Turkish and Bosnian Muslim aristocratic feudal landlords as well, were settled in the central part of the Una river region (Pounje), around Brekovica, Ripač, Ostrovica and Vrla Draga up to Sokolovac, in such numbers that they formed a significant population of this region.\n\nAt first, Telli Hasan Pasha's troops met little resistance, allowing them to capture numerous Uskoci settlements, where they enslaved or slaughtered the entire population and burned the settlements. His forces soon besieged and captured Senj and exterminated the Uskoci population. For his successes, the Pasha was awarded the title of \"Vizier\" by the Sultan. However, the following year, Telli Hasan Pasha decided to advance further into Croatia. His force of some twenty-thousand was soundly defeated in his third attempt to conquer Sisak, in the battle that took place near by that fortified town, in which Hasan Pasha is generally reported to have died, alongside his brother Džafer Bey (governor of the Sanjak of Pakrac-Cernica), Mehmed Pasha (the sultan's nephew and governor of the Sanjak of Herzegovina), Opardi Bey (governor of the Sanjak of Klis-Livno), and many other Turkish and Bosnian Muslim Pashas, Beys and Aghas, who accompanied the Vizier in his campaign, having been routed. According to Mustafa Naima: \"The brave Hasan Pasha himself also met with his fate, having fallen into the river with one of the bridges which had been cut to prevent the pursuit of the enemy. Such was the result of this terrible day.\" Indeed, after he had drowned in the river, his dress was taken as a trophy to Ljubljana where it was remade into the sacerdotal coat worn by the bishop during the celebration of the Thanksgiving mass.\n\nA monastery was built on the location of his grave, after requests of a Predojević to Sultan Murad, who also granted Kolunić and Smiljan (\"metochion\"). Safvet-beg Bašagić praises him as a \"meritorious\" general and statesman, as well as a \"great and fearless hero\".\n\n \n"}

One of the first Soviet diplomats, Vorovsky is best remembered as the victim of a May 1923 political assassination in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was the official representative of the Soviet government to the Conference of Lausanne.\n\nVatslav Vorovsky was born October 27, 1871 (n.s.) in Moscow, the son of an ethnic Polish engineer. Following the completion of secondary school, Vorovsky enrolled at the University of Moscow, where he was exposed to the ideas of political radicalism.\n\nVorovsky became active in the socialist movement in 1895. He was arrested by the Tsarist secret police shortly thereafter and sentenced to three years' exile in the city of Orlov. Upon his release, Vorovsky adopted a new underground pseudonym, \"P. Orlovsky,\" as a tribute to this experience. During the course of his underground career, Vorovsky also used the pseudonyms \"Y. Adamovich,\" \"M. Schwarz,\" \"Josephine,\" and \"Felix Alexandrovich.\"\n\nVorovsky emigrated to Europe in 1902, spending time in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. In 1903 he affiliated himself with the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, becoming an editor of the official organ of the party, \"Vperyod\" (Forward), in 1905.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1905, Vorovsky returned to Russia, working actively as a revolutionary in St. Petersburg. Following the defeat of the 1905 uprising he moved to Odessa in the Ukraine, where he was a leading underground Bolshevik from 1907 to 1912.\n\nIn 1912, Vorovsky was arrested again, this time to be deported to Europe.\n\nVorovsky returned to Russia in 1915, landing in Petrograd — the new name of St. Petersburg — but he was soon sent to Stockholm by a business firm.\n\nHe was the first director of Gosizdat, the State Publishing House, from its foundation in 1919 until 1921.\n\nFollowing the victory of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917, Vorovsky was named the Soviet government's diplomatic representative to Scandinavia, remaining based in Stockholm. In Stockholm, Vorovsky was the point of contact between the new Bolshevik government and representatives of the government of Germany, being introduced by Alexander Parvus to such luminaries of the German Social-Democratic Party as Philipp Scheidemann during November and December 1917.\n\nIn December 1918, Sweden, responding to pressure on the part of the Allied powers who were intent upon imposing an unbreakable blockade, withdrew official recognition of Vorovsky as the representative of Soviet Russia. This action on the part of the Swedish government forced Vorovsky's return to Russia the following month. This action taken against Vorovsky followed the precedent followed by Great Britain in expelling Maxim Litvinov in September 1918 and that of Germany in expelling Adolph Joffe in November of that same year.\n\nIn March 1919, Vorovsky served as a member of the Soviet delegation to the Founding Congress of the Communist International. He was named the representative of the Russian Communist Party to the Executive Committee of the Comintern. He also served as one of the secretaries of the organization, along with Angelica Balabanova. Grigorii Zinoviev was tapped as president of the organization.\n\nIn July 1920, Vorovsky resumed work as a Soviet diplomat, participating in diplomatic negotiations with Poland.\n\nFrom 1921 to 1923, Vorovsky was the Soviet representative to Italy. In that capacity he was involved in attempts at negotiation of a trade agreement between the two countries, with a preliminary pact signed in December 1921. This success proved short-lived, however, as negotiations to extend the six-month treaty failed in May 1922.\n\nVorovsky was a member of the Soviet delegation to the 1922 Genoa Conference, a group headed by Soviet Foreign Minister Georgii Chicherin.\n\nVorovsky's final diplomatic mission came in the spring of 1923, when he served as Soviet representative to the Lausanne conference of 1923. Accompanied by two diplomatic attachés, Vorovsky arrived in Lausanne from Rome on April 27, hoping to force the conference's official participants to recognize Soviet interests in the Turkish Black Sea Straits.\n\nOn May 9, Vorovsky dispatched his final report to Moscow, noting that three days earlier a group of right wing youths had appeared at his hotel and sought a meeting. Vorovsky wrote:\n\n\"I refused to receive them, and Comrade Ahrens, who went out to them to find out what it was all about, disposed of them at once, telling them that they should put such matters before their Government. Now they are going about the town declaring that they will compel us to leave Switzerland by force, and so on.\n\n\"As to whether the police are taking any measures for our safety, we have no idea. At any rate, it is not apparent on the surface. It is only too evident that behind these hooligan boys there is some conscious directing hand — possibly foreign. The Swiss Government, well aware of what is going on — for the papers are full of it — must bear responsibility for our safety. The behaviour of the Swiss Government is a shameful violation of the guarantees given at the beginning of the conference, and any attack on us in this particularly well-organised country is only possible with the knowledge and permission of the authorities. On them is the responsibility.\"\n\nOn the evening of May 10, 1923, Vorovsky was seated at a dining table in the restaurant of his hotel with his colleagues when the group was approached by an individual they did not know. The unknown figure, a Russian White émigré named Maurice Conradi, pulled a gun and shot Vorovsky to death, wounding his two companions, Ahrens and Divilkovsky, in the attack. Conradi was defended by the advocate Théodore Aubert and later acquitted by the Swiss court in the epilogue of what would be known as the Conradi affair. It was later alleged that the murder was actually ordered by Stalin. \n\nVatslav Vorovsky was 51 years old at the time of his death.\n\n\n\n"}

He composed in all the major musical forms (two symphonies, a violin concerto, four large scale choral works, nearly 300 songs and an opera), and is best known for the \"Yellow River Cantata\" upon which the \"Yellow River Concerto\" for piano and orchestra is based.\n\nXian was born in Portuguese Macau in 1905, to Tanka parents whose ancestors were from Panyu, Guangdong. He moved frequently in his early life with his mother as his father had died before Xian was born. Xian moved with his mother to Singapore when he was six years old, he was enrolled in Yangzheng Primary School for his primary education. It was while at Yangzheng Primary School that he took his first step into his musical career. His teacher, Ou Jianfu, first noticed Xian Xinghai's musical talent, and he was enrolled into the school's military band. Xian received training in both musical instruments as well as music. He was later brought to Guangzhou for further education by his then school principal, Lin Yaoxiang, along with 19 other students. Xian started learning the clarinet in 1918 at the YMCA charity school attached to the Lingnan University in Guangzhou (Canton). \n\nIn 1924 he studied in Saint Andrew's School of Singapore. In 1926 he joined the National Music Institute at Peking University to study music and in 1928 he entered National Shanghai Conservatory of Music to study violin and piano. The same year he published his well-known essay \"The Universal Music\". In 1929 he went to Paris (where he met Ma Sicong who introduced him to many artists there) and was disliked by his teacher first because he didn't know how to play piano but one night he got home and was mad and composed a song which the teacher heard. The teacher came inside and was fascinated with his work and asked him to bring his piece of work to the university where the composers competed their work and he won and he was accepted to that music school. In 1934 he was the first Chinese student admitted to the Paris Conservatory to study senior composition with Paul Dukas. And before this, he had studied with Vincent D'Indy. During this period he composed \"Wind\", \"Song of a Wanderer\", \"Violin Sonata in D Minor\", and other works.\n\nXian returned to China in 1935 to the Japanese occupation of the northeastern part of the country (known then as Manchuria). Using his music as a weapon to protest the occupation, he took part in patriotic activities. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), he wrote vocal works that encouraged the people to fight the Japanese invaders, including \"Saving the Nation\", \"Non-Resistance the Only Fear\", \"Song of Guerrillas\", \"The Roads Are Opened by Us\", \"The Vast Siberia\", \"Children of the Motherland\", \"Go to the Homefront of the Enemy\", and \"On the Taihang Mountains\", among others. He worked for film studios before going to the Communist headquarters in Yan'an, where he became dean of the Music Department at Lu Xun Institute of Arts in 1938. It is at this time that he composed the famous \"Yellow River Cantata\" and the \"Production Cantata\".\nIn 1940 Xian went to the Soviet Union to compose the score of the documentary film \"Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army\". Before departure Mao Zedong invited him to dinner. In 1941 the German invasion of the Soviet Union disrupted his work and he attempted to return to China by way of Xinjiang but the local anti-communist warlord, Sheng Shicai, blocked the way and he got stranded in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. It was here that he composed the symphonies \"Liberation of the Nation\" and \"Sacred War\", and the suites \"Red All Over the River\" and \"Chinese Rhapsody\" for winds and strings. He developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to overwork and malnutrition. After the war, Xian went back to Moscow for medical treatment but died of pulmonary disease on October 30, 1945 at the age of 40.\n\nXian composed over 300 works, published 35 papers, including \"Nie Er—the Creator of New Chinese Music\" and \"On the National Styles of Chinese Music\". His influence in Chinese music won him the title People's Composer.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), when all the Western and some Chinese art was forbidden, the pianist Yin Chengzong arranged the \"Yellow River Cantata\" into a concerto for piano and orchestra, by the name of \"Yellow River Piano Concerto\" (1969).\n\nAfter China opened its doors to the world in late 1970s, Yin planned the performance of the piano concerto. There was a debate whether some politically incorrect anthems like \"The East Is Red\", which Yin interpolated into the concerto, should be removed. It was decided that the work itself was a cultural legacy of the time when it was created, the melodies reminding listeners of that period and creating a unique sense of history. Hence, the work remained intact as it was originally arranged.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, the \"Yellow River Concerto\" has been heard in the West, often performed by Yin Chengzong himself, and in 1988 the Italian pianist Riccardo Caramella became the first Western pianist who performed it in China with a Chinese orchestra, the Beijing Radio Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe epic film \"The Star and The Sea\" (2009) created by directors Qiankuan Li and Guiyun Xiao (a husband and wife team) is about the hard childhood and suffering of Xian in that period of his life and the efforts of his mother to help him developing his musical talents.\n\n\n\n"}
