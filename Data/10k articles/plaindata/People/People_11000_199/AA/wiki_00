In the early 1960s, she moved to Santa Ana and sang in Los Angeles-area nightclubs. Singer Bill Medley, whose career with The Righteous Brothers was just beginning, was told about Willis. Medley and Willis recorded a song together at Gold Star Studios, but it was never released. However, her voice and association with the studio drew notice from producers Phil Spector and Leon Russell, who retooled the country song \"Act Naturally\" into a rhythm and blues version for Willis in 1965. As part of the duo Betty and Ray, with Ray Lockhart, she also made several other recordings. Her last known recording was in 1968.\n\nAccording to her daughter, Willis enjoyed a singing career but did not want to be part of the music industry.

{"id": "55361034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55361034", "title": "Bo Bo Aung", "text": "Bo Bo Aung\n\nBo Bo Aung () was a prominent phothudaw and weizza (, ), or wizard, from Sagaing who lived in Myanmar during the Konbaung Dynasty, or the 18th century. He was also called Maung Aung, or \"Master Victory\". He supposedly lived to be around 200 years of age. He is credited with creating the modern wiezza movement when he discovered manuscripts revealing the secrets of weizzas and mastered the art of qin.\n\n\"Bo Bo\" is a common Burmese honorific which translates to \"uncle\".\n\nAung's exact birthdate is unknown, though he was a classmate of the future King Bodawpaya, who was born in the Burmese era 1106, as well as of the future Taungpila Sayadaw. Aung's name at birth was Pho Aung. His father was Pho Myat San and his mother was Mae Nyein Yar. Due to his parent's lack of financial resources, Aung was malnourished as a child. Consequently, he suffered from skin disease and was taunted by his peers, who called him \"Maung Wei\". \"Maung\" means \"teenage boy\" and \"wei\" being a Burmese word for scabies.\n\nOne day, while the Kye Ni Sayadaw was having a nap, he dreamed that he was woken by a holy man dressed in white. In the dream, the man in white led him to the lake at the back of the monastery, gestured to a specific area of the lake, then disappeared. When the Sayadaw awoke, he felt as if the dream were real. Days later, he was thinking about his dream and went out to the lake to look again at the spot the white robed man pointed to. When he reached the edge of the lake he felt something in the water under a tree. It was a copper manuscript. He washed it off and took it to the monastery.\n\nNot long after this, the Sayadaw passed away. He was cremated and his remains were entombed and his three main disciples began to divide his possessions. The new Sayadaw jokingly threw an old pillow to Aung, and told him that that was his inheritance from the former Sayadaw. Out of respect, Aung accepted it. He used it to balance his elbow while he wrote on the floor. The pillow eventually began to tear and he saw that there was something hard inside the pillow. Later, he overheard some wise men discussing the lost copper manuscript of the former Sayardaw.\n\nWhen Aung became a powerful weizza, his old classmate, King Bodawpaya attempted to have him assassinated because he refused to acknowledge him as the future Buddha. First, he sent a team of soldiers to find Aung. The soldiers begged him to return when them, saying that they would be killed if they failed the king. Aung ordered the soldiers to send a report to the king that they had captured him and put him in chains at the bottom of their boat. He promised them that he would appear in the boat when it arrived at the capital.\n\nThe soldiers did as he said. When their boat reached the capital two weeks later, they found Aung lying at the bottom of the boat tied in chains. King Bodawpaya gathered his people to witness the execution. He ordered the executioners to throw Aung into a deep ditch and buried him alive. Later that evening, when Bodawpaya was meeting with his ministers, Bo Bo Aung appeared. He told the king that he was a false friends and reminded him that they had sworn eternal friendship to each other. He told him that he did not want to take over his kingdom. He wrote a circle in chalk on the palace floor and presented a challenge to the king. He told the king to erase the chalk drawing from the floor. The King, full of shame and anger, rubbed out the circle but then two more appeared. He continued to try to erase the chalk circles until the whole palace floor was covered with hundreds of them. Aung again chided the king, who begged him to protect his family. Aung vowed to do that and then vanished.\n\nMany Burmese Buddhists believe that Aung never died, but remains on earth to wait for the coming of the next Buddha and protect the Dharma. They believe that he is available to help pious laypeople in their daily struggles. He is often accompanied by a statue of Bo Min Gaung, another prominent weizzas, on Buddhist alters in Myanmar.\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, many Burmese associated Aung with the Freedom Movement against British colonization. The movement sought to draw on his mystical weizzas powers. Bogyoke Aung San (the father of Aung San Suu Kyi) was considered to have been the reincarnation of Aung.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10442495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10442495", "title": "Boer Commando", "text": "Boer Commando\n\nThe Boer commandos or \"Kommandos\" were volunteer military units of guerilla militia organized by the Boer people of South Africa. The term came into English usage during the Second Boer War of 1899-1902.\n\nIn 1658, war erupted between the Dutch settlers at Cape Colony and the Khoi-khoi. In order to protect the settlement, all able bodied men were conscripted. After the conclusion of this war, all men in the colony were liable for military service and were expected to be ready on short notice.\n\nBy 1700, the size of the colony had increased immensely and it was divided into districts. The small military garrison stationed at the Castle de Goede Hoop couldn't be counted on to react swiftly in the border districts, therefore the commando system was expanded and formalized. Each district had a Kommandant who was charged with calling up all burghers in times of need. In 1795, with the First British Occupation and again in 1806 with the Second British Occupation, the commandos were called up to defend the Cape Colony. At the Battle of Blaauwberg (6 January 1806), the Swellendam Commando held the British off long enough for the rest of the Batavian army to retreat to safety.\n\nUnder British rule, the Cape Colony continued to use the commando system in its frontier wars, in addition to regular British imperial troops. Boer commandos fought alongside Fengu, British settlers, Khoi-khoi and other ethnic groups in units which were often mixed. Light, mobile commandos were undeniably better-suited than the slow-moving columns of imperial troops, for warfare in the rough frontier mountains. However, tensions often arose in the Cape's government over the relative merits and control of these two parallel military systems.\n\nDuring the Great Trek, this system was used and remained in use in the Boer republics. Both republics issued commando laws, making commando service mandatory in times of need for all male citizens between the ages of 16 and 60.\nDuring the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902) the Boer commando formed the backbone of the Boer forces.\n\nAfter the declaration of peace in 1902, the commandos were disbanded. They did reform themselves in clandestine \"shooting clubs\". In 1912, the commandos were reformed as an Active Citizen Force in the Union Defence Force. This system was in operation until 2005, when all commandos were disbanded again.\n\nEach commando was attached to a town, after which it was named (e.g. Bloemfontein Commando). Each town was responsible for a district, divided into wards. The commando was commanded by a kommandant and each ward by a veldkornet or field cornet (equivalent of a senior NCO rank)\n\nThe veldkornet was responsible not only for calling up the burghers, but also for policing his ward, collecting taxes, issuing firearms and other materiel in times of war. Theoretically, a ward was divided into corporalships. A corporalship was usually made up of about 20 burghers. Sometimes entire families (fathers, sons, uncles, cousins) filled a corporalship.\n\nThe veldkornet was responsible to the kommandant, who in turn was responsible to a general. In theory, a general was responsible for four commandos. He in turn was responsible to the commander-in-chief of the republic. In the Transvaal, the C-in-C was called the Commandant-General and in the Free State the \"Hoofdkommandant\" (Chief Commandant). The C-in-C was responsible to the president.\n\nOther auxiliary ranks were created in war time, such as \"vleiskorporaal\" (\"meat corporal\"), responsible for issuing rations.\n\nThe commando was made up of volunteers, all officers were appointed by the members of the commando, and not by the government. This gave a chance for some commanders to appear, such as General Koos de la Rey and General C. R. de Wet, but also had the disadvantage of sometimes putting inept commanders in charge. Discipline was also a problem, as there was no real way of enforcing it.\n\nThe various Boer republics did not all have the same command structure.\n\nBefore the Boer War, the two Boer republics had permanent artillery units (e.g. the Transvaalse Staatsartillerie), equipped with Krupp or Creusot artillery. From the early days, the commandos were issued with firearms by the government of the day. The burghers were obliged to keep these firearms serviceable and ready at all times. \n\nIn the Anglo-Boer War, most burghers were issued with the modern, clip-loading Mauser rifle, but a range of weapons were in use, including:\n\n\nThe following Boer commandos existed in the Orange Free State and Transvaal:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22448640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22448640", "title": "Carl Ray", "text": "Carl Ray\n\nCarl Ray (January 10, 1943 – September 26, 1978) was a First Nations artist who was active on the Canadian art scene from 1969 until his death in 1978. Considered primarily a Woodlands Style artist, he also painted European style wildlife and landscapes. He was a founding member of the Indian Group of Seven. He began painting when he was 30 years old.\n\nSelf-taught artist Carl Ray was born on January 10, 1943 on the Sandy Lake First Nation reserve in northern Ontario, Canada and was known in his Cree community as Tall Straight Poplar (he was 6'4\" tall) where he hunted and trapped after leaving residential school at fifteen following the death of his father. At this traditional way of living he was a failure - in Carl's own words years later: \"a year's catch consisted of four beaver, one lynx, and an assortment of mice and rabbits\". Despite showing artistic promise at an early age, Carl was reluctant to break the taboo of painting the sacred beliefs and stories of his people. He did not touch a brush or paint for many years after having been admonished by his elders for doing so.\n\nHe eventually left the reserve to work in the Red Lake gold mines where his drinking and guitar playing abilities earned him the nickname Ira Hayes. However, his excesses caught up with him and he contracted tuberculosis, eventually recovered in Fort William and returned home in 1966. It was not until then that Norval Morrisseau's success in breaking the painting taboos allowed Carl to confidently pursue his craft, which in many cases, included \"legend painting\" and painting wildlife and northern scenic landscapes.\n\nHe apprenticed under Norval Morrisseau (who had already achieved national and international acclaim) and worked on the mural for the Indians of Canada Pavilion of Expo '67 in Montreal. Norval had designed and sketched the mural but it was Carl who did most of the work and was left to finish it. Unfortunately this masterpiece is lost as it was left to fall into disrepair and was eventually demolished years later.\n\nAs well as translating the legends, Carl also created a large and impressive group of illustrations for James Stevens' book \"Legends of the Sandy Lake Cree\" in 1971. Stevens reported that Carl \"perceived this reversion to a more austere style as a loss of face\" Many of the illustrations would somewhat haunt him since it was now the kind of work that was expected of him in certain markets.\n\nWith the help of Ontario Department of Education Superintendent Robert Lavack, Carl embarked on a tour teaching art at schools in northern communities including Kirkland Lake, Timmins, Blind River, Wawa, Bruce Mines, Manitoulin Island, Sudbury, Levack, North Bay, Bracebridge, Oshawa and Whitby. Carl also taught at the Manitou Arts Foundation on Schreiber Island in 1971. The following year the department of Indian Affairs sponsored the tour through northern communities and reserves.\n\nCarl continued to develop and paint through the mid 70's completing notable large scale mural opportunities at schools and the Sioux Lookout Fellowship and Communications Centre as well as smaller works becoming more and more popular with white buyers. In the early 1970s Ray had the first solo exhibition of his black and sepia, Woodlands style paintings on paper and canvas at Aggregation Gallery in Toronto. Aggregation Gallery continued to represent his work and estate through to the early 80's. By 1975, the Indian Group of Seven had formed and Ray was enjoying acclaim and purchases by notable collectors such as Dr. Peter Lewin and Dr. Bernard Cinader, as well as public institutions such as the McMichael Canadian Art Collection. He also illustrated the cover of \"The White City\" published by Tom Marshall in 1976. Much of Carl's art was influenced by his often troubled personal life and inner demons and excesses.\n\nCarl was known by his peers as a man of general good humour. He was also known as somewhat of a jokester as described by fellow painter Alex Janvier: \"Carl Ray was the guy who could laugh, make fun of you, throw a joke on you and he'd laugh his head off\".\n\nCarl Ray was murdered, stabbed to death, as a result of a drunken brawl over money in Sioux Lookout in 1978. He was only 35 years old. In a note to Carl Ray by George Kenny after his death he wrote \"I wonder if those paintings you painted ever satisfied your demons that drove you to paint…Didn't you realize that fame only comes at the meeting of one of those demons – DEATH? ….Now we'll never know the extent of your greatness…\" \n\nCarl Ray is best known for his work executed in the style of the Woodlands School (often referred to as \"legend painting\" style). \n\nLacking sophisticated technique, but resplendent with powerful imagery, his super-realistic images were unique, and his signature style is easily recognized. Describing his work, Carl stated \"What you are looking at is ancient and sacred. In fact what you see could be described as a part of my soul\". The spiritual and emotional commitment he put into his work was substantial - \"his (work) came from a very deep journey, a lot of people are afraid to make that journey\" Many of his works were limited to two or three colours, brown, black and blue, often mixing ink and watercolours.\n\nHis lesser known, but equally powerful scenic western style canvases were also a large part of Carl's repertoire. Often ensconced in hues of electric blue, he captured the wildlife and beauty of the Sandy Lake area. He also combined the two styles on occasion, capturing his imaginative images of Cree legends in full electrifying colour.\n\n1969 Brandon University, Manitoba.\n1970 Confederation College, Thunder Bay, Ontario.\n1971 Fort Frances Public Library.\n1972 University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.\n1972 Gallerie Fore, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n1972-1977 Aggregation Gallery, Toronto, Ontario.\n\n1974 Canadian Indian Art '74, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto.\n1974 Contemporary Native Arts of Ontario, Oakville Centennial Gallery, Ontario.\n1975 Dominion Gallery, Montreal, Quebec.\n1975 Wallack Gallery, Ottawa, Ontario. \n1975 Art Emporium, Vancouver, B.C. \n1976 Contemporary Native Arts of Canada - The Woodland Indians, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto - travelling exhibition\n1977 Contemporary Indian Art - The Trail from the Past to the Future, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario.\n1978 Art of the Woodland Indian, McMichael Canadian Collection, Kleinburg, Ontario.\n1979 Kinder des Nanabush, from the McMichael Canadian Collection, Kleinburg, Ontario.\n1980 Contemporary Woodland Indian Painting, New College, University of Toronto, Ontario.\n1983 Contemporary Indian Art at Rideau Hall, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Ottawa, Ontario.\n1984 The Image Makers, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto - travelling exhibition\n"}

He was one of the last surviving actors to have appeared in silent film. A busy and popular actor during his childhood and youth, he appeared in over 100 films until the 1950s. Among his most notable appearances were the \"Our Gang\" series and films such as \"Oliver Twist\", \"Blonde Venus\", \"Sergeant York\" and \"Out of the Past\".\n\nMoore was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Nora Eileen (Orr) and John Richard Moore Sr., a banker. His mother was Irish, and his paternal grandparents were from England and Ireland. \n\nHe made his film debut in 1927 in the silent film \"The Beloved Rogue\", where he portrayed silent film star John Barrymore's character as a one-year-old baby. At the time of his death, Moore was one of the last surviving actors to have appeared in silent film. He quickly gained notable supporting roles. He had a significant role as Marlene Dietrich's son in Josef von Sternberg's drama \"Blonde Venus\" (1932). He also appeared with Barbara Stanwyck in \"So Big\" (1932), with Walter Huston in \"Gabriel Over the White House\" (1933) and with Spencer Tracy in \"Man's Castle\" (1933).\n\nBesides appearing in a number of major feature films, he was featured as a regular in the \"Our Gang\" series during the 1932–1933 season.

Jallow-Tambajang (born 22 October 1949) is a Gambian politician and activist who served as Vice-President of the Gambia and Minister of Women's Affairs from February 2017 to June 2018, under President Adama Barrow.\n\nEarly in her career she had been the chair of the Gambia National Women's Council and an advisor to Dawda Jawara, the first President of the Gambia as a nation independent from the colonial rule of the British Empire. After the military \"coup d'état\" in July 1994 that deposed the Jawara government, she held the post of Secretary of State for Health and Social Welfare from 1994 to 1995 in the cabinet of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council.\n\nShe was appointed as Vice-President by Barrow in January 2017, but was found ineligible due to constitutional age restrictions. She was instead made Minister of Women's Affairs overseeing the office of Vice-President, until the constitution was changed and she was formally sworn in as Vice-President in November 2017. Prior to her appointment, she had served as chair of Coalition 2016, the alliance of opposition political parties that had supported Barrow's candidacy in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTambajang was born in Brikama, the Gambia. She was educated in the Gambia, Dakar and France. She completed a BA in French at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis.\n\nTambajang was an advisor to Dawda Jawara, the first President of the Gambia, on women's issues and children's affairs. She chaired the Gambia National Women's Council and represented it in the Gambia National Economic and Social Council for six years.\n\nTambajang served as the Secretary of State for Health and Social Welfare from 1994 to 1995 in the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council cabinet. She was one of two female ministers in the cabinet, alongside Susan Waffa-Ogoo. She addressed the International Conference on Population and Development in September 1994 on behalf of the Gambia. She then went on to work for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and in the field of development, including 5 years in war-torn Mano River. In 2001, whilst working in the African Great Lakes, she was the victim of a rebel hostage situation.\n\nTambajang joined the United Democratic Party (UDP) in April 2015, during the Fass stand-off with security forces. Tambajang was a senior member of Coalition 2016, the alliance of political opposition parties that supported Barrow in the 2016 presidential election, and she also served as its chair. Following President Yahya Jammeh's defeat in the election, Tambajang declared that Jammeh would be prosecuted within a year. She also announced the creation of a national commission for asset recovery in order to reclaim what had allegedly been lost through corruption during Jammeh's tenure. On Jammeh, she told \"The Guardian\" that \"He can't leave. If he leaves, he's going to escape us.\"\n\nFollowing Barrow's inauguration on 19 January 2017, on 23 January it was announced that Tambajang would serve as his Vice-President. However, after her selection, it was suggested that she was constitutionally ineligible to take on the role. This was because section 62(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Gambia states that the Vice-President must meet the same age requirement as the President, establishing a maximum age of 65 at the time of entering the office – whereas Tambajang was reported to be 67 at the time of her selection. Following the reports, she was not sworn in immediately to the post, although she disputed the reported age – saying she was only 64 years old. Barrow challenged the public to show proof that she was above age 65. In February, she was appointed as Minister of Women's Affairs, with oversight of the vice-president's office.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, the National Assembly tried to approve a change to the constitution to eliminate the age limit. However, Halifa Sallah, the spokesman for the transitional government and an advisor to President Barrow, said that the proper procedure had not been followed for amending the constitution, and that the action needed to be revisited and such a change would take an additional several months to properly accomplish (according to section 226 of the constitution).\n\nSection 62 was amended by National Assembly of the Gambia on 25 July with the presidential age-limit being removed. Her appointment as Vice-President was confirmed by the President on 8 September and after finalization of her appointment, she was expected to be sworn-in. President Barrow announced officially appointing her as Vice-President on 9 November.\n\nTambajang was awarded 'New African Woman of the Year Award' by \"New African Woman Magazine\" in April 2017. In March 2017, Tambajang joined the Crans Montana African Women's Forum Honorary Committee. During a cabinet reshuffle on 29 June 2018, Tambajang was redeployed to the foreign service.\n\nTambajang is from the Fula ethnic group and resides in Kanifing District. She is the mother of eight children.\n"}

{"id": "640818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=640818", "title": "Georges Sorel", "text": "Georges Sorel\n\nGeorges Eugène Sorel (; ; 2 November 1847 – 29 August 1922) was a French philosopher and theorist of Sorelianism. His notion of the power of myth in people's lives (in particular, national myth) inspired socialists, anarchists, Marxists, and Fascists. It is, together with his defense of violence, the contribution for which he is most often remembered.\n\nBorn in Cherbourg as the son of a bankrupted wine merchant, he moved to Paris in 1864 to attend the Collège Rollin, before entering the École Polytechnique a year later. He became chief engineer with the Department of Public Works, stationed briefly in Corsica, and for a longer period in Perpignan. In 1891, he was awarded the Légion d'honneur. He retired in 1892 and moved to Boulogne-sur-Seine, near Paris, where he stayed until his death.\n\nBeginning in the second half of the 1880s, he published articles in various fields (hydrology, architecture, physics, political history, and philosophy) displaying the influence of Aristotle, as well as Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan. In 1893, he publicly affirmed his position as a Marxist and a socialist. His social and political philosophy owed much to his reading of Proudhon, Karl Marx, Giambattista Vico, Henri Bergson (whose lectures at the Collège de France he attended), and later William James. Sorel's engagement in the political world was accompanied by a correspondence with Benedetto Croce, and later with Vilfredo Pareto. Sorel worked on the first French Marxist journals, \"L’Ère nouvelle\" and \"Le Devenir social\", and then participated at the turn of the century in the revisionist debate and crisis within Marxism. He took the side of Eduard Bernstein against Karl Kautsky. Sorel supported acquittal during the Dreyfus affair, although, like his friend Charles Péguy, he later felt betrayed by what he saw as the opportunism of the Dreyfusards. Through his contributions to Enrico Leone's \"Il Divenire sociale\" and Hubert Lagardelle's \"Mouvement socialiste\", he contributed around 1905 to the theoretical elaboration of revolutionary syndicalism. In 1906, his most famous text, \"Reflections on Violence\", appeared in this last journal. It was published in book form in 1908, and was followed the same year by \"Illusions du Progrès\".\n\nDisappointed by the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), Sorel associated himself for a period in 1909-1910 with Charles Maurras’ Action française, while sharing neither its nationalism nor its political program. This collaboration inspired the founders of the Cercle Proudhon, which brought together revolutionary syndicalists and monarchists. Sorel himself, with Jean Variot, founded a journal in 1911 called \"L'Indépendance\", although disagreements, in part over nationalism, soon ended the project.\n\nFerociously opposed to the 1914 Union sacrée, Sorel denounced the war and in 1917 praised the Russian Revolution, which was later printed in an official Soviet Union publication, Russian Soviet Government Bureau, calling Lenin \"the greatest theoretician of socialism since Marx and a statesman whose genius recalls that of Peter the Great.\" He wrote numerous small pieces for Italian newspapers defending the Bolsheviks. Less than one year later in March 1921, Sorel turned his praise towards a rising Fascist leader in Italy, writing that \"Mussolini is a man no less extraordinary than Lenin. He, too, is a political genius, of a greater reach than all the statesmen of the day, with the only exception of Lenin…\" Inexplicably, Sorel found it necessary to heap praise on both a Russian Bolshevik and an Italian Fascist leader almost concurrently.\n\nSorel was extremely hostile to Gabriele D’Annunzio, the poet who attempted to re-conquer Fiume for Italy, and did not show sympathy for the rise of fascism in Italy, despite Jean Variot's later claims that he placed all his hopes in Benito Mussolini. After the war, Sorel published a collection of his writings entitled \"Matériaux d’une Théorie du Prolétariat\". At the time of his death, in Boulogne sur Seine, he had an ambivalent attitude towards both Fascism and Bolshevism.\n\nAlthough his writing touched on many subjects, Sorel's work is best characterized by his original interpretation of Marxism, which was deeply anti-determinist, politically anti-elitist, anti-Jacobin, and built on the direct action of unions, the mobilizing role of myth—especially that of the general strike—and on the disruptive and regenerative role of violence. Whether Sorel is better seen as a left-wing or right-wing thinker is disputed: the Italian Fascists praised him as a forefather, but the dictatorial government they established ran contrary to his beliefs, while he was also an important touchstone for Italy's first Communists, who saw Sorel as a theorist of the proletariat. Such widely divergent interpretations arise from the theory that a moral revival of the country must take place to re-establish itself, saving it from decadence; yet whether this revival must occur by means of the middle and upper classes or of the proletariat is a point in question.\n\n\"Sorel began his writing as a marginal Marxist, a critical analyst of Marx's economics and philosophy, and not a pious commentator. He then embraced revisionism, became for several years the 'metaphysician of syndicalism', as Jaurès called him, flirted ardently with royalist circles, and then reverted to his commitment to the proletariat. When the Bolsheviks came to power, he completed his cycle of illusions by saluting Vladimir Lenin as the leader who had realized his syndicalist myth.\"\n\n\"The syndicalist or militant trade union movement, which burst into prominence in France around 1900, inspired Sorel to write his \"Reflections on Violence\". The turmoil engendered by strikes was universally condemned even by parliamentary socialists, who favored negotiation and conciliation. To justify the militancy and to give syndicalism an ideology, Sorel published the series of articles that became, as one of his biographers calls it, 'a famous and infamous book.'\" Indeed, it was Sorel's only successful book of about a dozen published, which cemented his legacy by 1912 as \"the leading figure amongst the French Syndicalists.\" This book was published in Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese and English.\n\nTwo of its themes have become a part of social science literature: the concept of the social myth and the virtue of violence. To Sorel the Syndicalist's general strike, the Marxist's catastrophic revolution, the Christian's church militant, the legends of the French Revolution, and the remembrance of June Days are all myths that move men, quite independent of their historical reality. As one of Sorel's disciples (Benito Mussolini) said, men do not move mountains; it is only necessary to create the illusion that mountains move. Social myths, says Sorel, are not descriptions of things, but \"expressions of a determination to act.\"\n\nMyths enclose all the strongest inclinations of a people, of a party, or of a class, and the general strike is \"the myth in which Socialism is wholly comprised.\" For Sorel the general strike was a catastrophic conception of socialism, the essence of the class struggle, and the only true Marxist means of effecting the revolution. Nowhere does Sorel endorse indiscriminate, brutal violence; only violence \"enlightened by the idea of the general strike\" is unconditionally defended. Only violence in the Marxist class war, as Sorel conceived it, is fine and heroic and in the service of the \"immemorial interest of civilization.\" In fact, Sorel makes no justification of violence by philosophical argument, but uses long excursions into history and current events to suggest that ethical codes are relative to their time and place. Consistent with his position he could describe the Declaration of the Rights of Man as \"only a colorless collection of abstract and confused formulas, without any practical bearing.\"\n\nSorel had been politically monarchist and traditionalist before embracing orthodox Marxism in the 1890s. He attempted to fill in what he believed were gaps in Marxist theory, resulting in an extremely heterodox and idiosyncratic view of Marxism. For instance, Sorel saw pessimism and irrationalism at the core of Marxism and rejected Karl Marx's own rationalism and \"utopian\" tendency. Sorel also saw Marxism as closer in spirit to early Christianity than to the French Revolution. He did not view Marxism as \"true\" in a scientific sense, as orthodox Marxists did, but believed Marxism's \"truth\" lay in its promise of a morally redemptive role for the proletariat, within a terminally decadent society.\n\nSorel's was a voluntarist Marxism: he rejected those Marxists who believed in inevitable and evolutionary change, emphasizing instead the importance of will and preferring direct action. These approaches included general strikes, boycotts, and constant disruption of capitalism with the goal being to achieve worker control over the means of production. Sorel's belief in the need for a deliberately conceived \"myth\" to sway crowds into concerted action was put into practice by mass fascist movements in the 1920s. The epistemic status of the idea of \"myth\" is of some importance, and is essentially that of a working hypothesis, with one fundamental peculiarity: it is an hypothesis which we do not judge by its closeness to a \"Truth\", but by the practical consequences which stem from it. Thus, whether a political myth is of some importance or not must be decided, in Sorel's view, on the basis of its capacity to mobilize human beings into political action; the only possible way for men to ascend to an ethical life filled by the character of the sublime and to achieve deliverance. Sorel believed the \"energizing myth\" of the general strike would serve to enforce solidarity, class consciousness and revolutionary élan among the working class. The \"myth\" that the fascists would appeal to, however, was that of the race, nation, or people, as represented by the state. Historian Zeev Sternhell mentions frequently Sorel as one of the men who led the way to the fusion of the left-wing revisionists and of the right-wing ultranationalists into what later became fascism. Sorel's vision of socialism was \"a-Marxist, anti-Marxist, eventually post-Marxist revisionist\". Sternhell says that \"the socialism designed as 'ethical socialism' by Sorel, Robert Michels and Arturo Labriola [...] will play a huge role in the evolution of the socialist nationalist synthesis, in the eve of 1914 and in the Interwar\".\n\nShlomo Sand and Zeev Sternhell agree that Sorel was antisemitic. Sternhell says in \"Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France\" (\"Ni droite ni gauche, l'idéologie fasciste en France\") that antisemitism was a cornerstone of Sorel's revolutionary syndicalism. Sand says that Sorel can be legitimately said to be antisemitic, as he proved his Judeophobia through his writings and public declarations.\n\nIn his most famous work \"Reflections on Violence\" (1908), Sorel warned about the political trend that conservatives and parliamentary socialists could become allies in the struggle against capitalism. Sorel's view is that the conservatives and parliamentary socialism had common goals, both conceiving of the nation as a centrally controlled, organic unit. Also, the parliamentarian socialism of the left wants economic nationalism, and huge tariff-barriers in order to protect their interior capitalists and this meshes with the cultural nationalism of the conservatives. Sorel warned about the creation of corporatism, where the workers movements and the employers organizations would merge, thus ending the class-struggle; because he felt that parliamentary democracy was moving in that direction at the beginning of the 19th century, Sorel said that the workers should stay away from the socialist parties, and use strikes and violence instead as their primary weapons against the middle and upper classes in parliament. That way, the workers would not only fight harder for their share of the values produced by capitalism, but also avoid the semi-feudal, corporative dystopia and oligarchy that the socialists and the conservatives were, supposedly, working towards.\n\nIn his \"Reflections on Violence\", Sorel says that parliamentary socialism, and its middle-class of bureaucrats and newspaper-intellectuals does not understand social science, economics, or any other matter important for good rule as well as the traditional liberal and capitalist elite that ruled before the mediocre middle-class became a powerful force in parliament. \"How did these mediocre and silly people become so powerful?\" Sorel asks. His theory on this is that the mediocre middle-class became powerful when the working-classes, people without property, were given the right to vote at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century. Thus, the working classes now created a problem for themselves by creating a political elite that is more stupid and less competent than the people who had a monopoly of power before them. He proposed that this problem could be fixed only by a collective withdrawal and boycott of the parliamentary system by the workers. Thus, the workers must return to strikes and violence as their main political tool, so Sorel says. This gives the workers a sense of unity, a return to dignity, and weakens the dangerous and mediocre middle-class in their struggle for power, and their attack on capitalism.\n\nSorel rejected political elitism because the middle-classes tend to co-opt all organizational hierarchies, and turn them into gentlemen's clubs for people who like to talk theory and write long newspaper articles. This point was made by Sorel in \"Reflections on Violence\", and was later developed further by Robert Michels and his Iron Law of Oligarchy.\n\nIsaiah Berlin identifies three anti-scientific currents in Sorel's work, but Sorel's attack on science is neither general nor piecemeal. Rather than \"attacks\", as is clear from the quotations below, Sorel explains how we should view \"science\" in relation to what he called \"the real thing\".\n\nHe dismissed science as \"a system of idealised entities: atoms, electric charges, mass, energy and the like – fictions compounded out of observed uniformities... deliberately adapted to mathematical treatment that enable men to identify some of the furniture of the universe, and to predict and... control parts of it.\" [1; 301] He regarded science more as \"an achievement of the creative imagination, not an accurate reproduction of the structure of reality, not a map, still less a picture, of what there was. Outside of this set of formulas, of imaginary entities and mathematical relationships in terms of which the system was constructed, there was ‘natural’ nature – the real thing…\" [1; 302] He regarded such a view as \"an odious insult to human dignity, a mockery of the proper ends of men\", [1; 300] and ultimately constructed by \"fanatical pedants\", [1; 303] out of \"abstractions into which men escape to avoid facing the chaos of reality.\" [1; 302]\n\nAs far as Sorel was concerned, \"nature is not a perfect machine, nor an exquisite organism, nor a rational system.\" [1; 302] He rejected the view that \"the methods of natural science can explain and explain away ideas and values…or explain human conduct in mechanistic or biological terms, as the…blinkered adherents of la petite science believe.\" [1; 310] He also maintained that the categories we impose upon the world, \"alter what we call reality…they do not establish timeless truths as the positivists maintained\", [1; 302] and to \"confuse our own constructions with eternal laws or divine decrees is one of the most fatal delusions of men.\" [1; 303] It is \"ideological patter... bureaucracy, la petite science... the Tree of Knowledge has killed the Tree of Life... human life [has been reduced] to rules that seem to be based on objective truths.\" [1; 303] Such to Sorel, is the appalling arrogance of science, a vast deceit of the imagination, a view that conspires to \"stifle the sense of common humanity and destroy human dignity.\" [1; 304]\n\nScience, he maintained, \"is not a ‘mill’ into which you can drop any problem facing you, and which yields solutions\", [1; 311] that are automatically true and authentic. Yet, he claimed, this is precisely how too many people seem to regard it.\n\nTo Sorel, that is way \"too much of a conceptual, ideological construction\", [1; 312] smothering our perception of truth through the \"stifling oppression of remorselessly tidy rational organisation.\" [1; 321] For Sorel, the inevitable \"consequence of the modern scientific movement and the application of scientific categories and methods to the behaviour of men\", [1; 323] is an outburst of interest in irrational forces, religions, social unrest, criminality and deviance – resulting directly from an overzealous and monistic obsession with scientific rationalism.\n\nAnd what science confers, \"a moral grandeur, bureaucratic organisation of human lives in the light of…la petite science, positivist application of quasi-scientific rules to society – all this Sorel despised and hated\", [1; 328] as so much self-delusion and nonsense that generates no good and nothing of lasting value.\n\n\n\n"}

He was nicknamed \"The Black Eagle\".\n\nHubert Fauntleroy Julian was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, in 1897. His father, Henry, was a cocoa plantation manager in Taco. Julian caught his first glimpse of an airplane on 3 January 1913, when Frank Boland performed an exhibition flight, ultimately crashing and dying. The shock of the crash stayed with Julian who, after World War I, left his island home for Canada. There, in November 1920, he flew for the first time during a joyride with Canadian flying ace Billy Bishop. Shortly after this he designed and patented what was labeled an \"Aeroplane Safety Appliance.\"\n\nIn 1921, Julian left Montreal for good and moved to Harlem. Once there he came under the influence of the charismatic Marcus Garvey and joined the Universal Negro Improvement Association. This new \"Garveyvite\" soon adopted a new persona, rechristening himself \"Lieutenant Hubert Julian\" of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Julian had a tailor fashion for him a fake military uniform in order to push his new narrative. On 3 September 1922, Julian performed his first parachute jump at Curtiss Field on Long Island; the event was headlined with a flight by Bessie Coleman. Julian would make one more jump that year before teaming up with aviator Clarence Chamberlin who, in addition to teaching his new business partner how to truly handle an airplane, flew him up above Harlem where the Trinidadian parachuted several times, the most famous moment coming when he wore a crimson jumpsuit while playing \"Runnin' Wild\" on a saxophone. This would be the stunt which caused H. Allen Smith to dub Julian, \"The Black Eagle of Harlem\".\n\nIn 1924, Julian, along with Chamberlin, began toying with the idea of performing a transatlantic flight, with stops, from New York City to Liberia. An old seaplane was purchased and refitted for the proposed flight; Julian dubbed it the \"Ethiopia\". On 4 July, with a crowd of thousands gathered at the banks of the Harlem River to witness his takeoff, Julian boarded his plane, after having UNIA members help raise some last-minute funds to pay off his investors, and soared into the sky. A few minutes would pass before Julian realized that one of his plane's pontoons had filled up with water, throwing the aircraft's weight off balance. Unable to regain control, Julian crashed into Flushing Bay.\n\nJulian would try twice more to pilot a transatlantic flight before the 1920s came to end. The first of these two attempts ended when his plane's wings were vandalized by unknown assailants while they were being stored in Happyland Park. The second, and final, attempt saw New York State Senator A. Spencer Feld take the helm of the endeavor, but after Amelia Earhart crossed the Atlantic Ocean, Julian felt dismayed at the prospect of performing something that had now been done by more than a handful of others and canceled the project.\n\nDuring the first half of the 1930s, Julian made three trips to the Ethiopian Empire. It was during his second visit when he crashed Haile Selassie's favorite plane, causing the emperor to ask Julian to leave his kingdom. But the Black Eagle would return on the eve of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, gaining a military commission to help defend the African kingdom. It was during this third trip when he would come to blows with John C. Robinson, the Brown Condor of Chicago, over jabs in the press which Julian attributed to Robinson. Once it became clear that the forces of Fascist Italy would prevail, Julian left the country, never to return.\n\nJulian spent his time stateside traveling with William Powell's Five Blackbirds, an all African-American flying troupe who performed in the Midwest and California as well as performing piloting services for paying customers like Father Divine. He also embarked in a short-lived film producing career with the director Oscar Micheaux, helping to fund the distribution for two of Micheaux's films: \"Lying Lips\" and \"The Notorious Eleanor Lee\".\n\nDuring the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Julian, along with many other American volunteers, left for Finland in order to help provide assistance. He was there for several months without seeing action, before departing back for the United States.\n\nWhen Julian learned, from Giuseppe Bellanca, what Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goring had been saying about peoples of color, the Black Eagle issued a challenge to the latter, offering the Nazi leader the chance to duel him in an aerial battle above the English Channel. Goring never gave an official response to the challenge, but Julian gained widespread praise for his bold verbal attacks.\n\nOnce the attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the United States into World War II, Julian, now in his 40s, enlisted into the military. He would serve less than a year, becoming an American citizen in the process, and earning an honorable discharge with the final rank of private first class.\n\nAfter the end of World War II Julian become a licensed arms dealer. His first contract was with the Arbenz government of Guatemala. He defied the FBI when, after being asked to cease his dealings, Julian continued selling. His second contract was with the Bautista government of Cuba as it tried, and ultimately failed, to combat Fidel Castro's revolutionaries. His third, and final, contract was with Moise Tshombe, leader of Katanga during the Congo Secession Crisis of the early 1960s. Julian was detained by United Nations forces for questioning and was in the end jailed for four months before being released. He retired upon his return to the United States.\n\nJulian spent his retirement meeting the likes of Muhammad Ali and appearing on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" and \"The Tonight Show\". He died in 1983 and was buried at Calverton National Cemetery in Suffolk County, New York.\n\nHubert Julian was married three times. His first marriage, which lasted only a few years, was to Edna Powell. His second marriage, his longest, was to Essie Gittens, who he had known while growing up in Trinidad. They raised a young orphaned cousin of Essie's, a girl named Olga, as their own. His third marriage, after Essie died, was to a woman named Doreen, who gave birth to Julian's only biological child, Mark Anthony Bernard Julian, in July 1971.\n\n\"\" is a documentary by independent filmmaker Billy Tooma. It covers Julian's life from his birth in Trinidad to his adventures in Harlem, Ethiopia, and everywhere between.

Hugh Baillie was son of Alexander Baillie by (married 1709) Hannah Fraser, of Relig. Alexander Baillie was son of David Baillie, 1st Laird of Dochfour, and second son of Alexander, 7th Laird of Dunain, from whom he inherited Dochfour, Easter and Wester Dochain in 1657, married secondly Margaret daughter of Hugh Fraser, 8th Lord Lovat.\n\nJames Baillie's younger brother was Evan Baillie, of Dochfour, of Parliament, the West Indies and Bristol.\n\nBaillie arrived in St. Christopher's (Saint Kitts) in 1755, and soon bought the Hermitage plantation in Grenada, undertook around 20 years of work, and in 1775 (?) returned to Great Britain and London. In 1772 James Baillie wrote: \"[through] 1755–71 I was employed in the line of planting and commerce in the islands of St Christopher and Grenada [and Demerary]... and [in 1772] our house sold Negroes here to the amount of £120,000 sterling...\" At the time of the 1833 compensation claims Baillie's heirs were awarded c. £73,700 compensation for their c. 1,821 slaves in Grenada, Guyana and St. Lucia.\n\nHe was M.P. for Horsham, in Sussex, from 1792 for only 18 months. There he had seemed to have been beaten at the poll, and so before a petition gave him the seat, he had been appointed British agent to Grenada. One is not sure whether he took up that post or where he died.\n\nBut as Member for Horsham Baillie it is known that he spoke well in favour of the planters (plantation owners) in the slavery debate of 2 April 1792, against Wilberforce's \"wild, impracticable, and visionary scheme\" of abolition, adding that there was \"more wretchedness and poverty in the parish of St. Giles' than in the whole of the British colonies\". He had his speech published.\n\nIn London Baillie lived in Bedford Square and Ealing Grove, the nine bays and three-storeyed pedimented central projection Palladian palace set in 64 acres, re-modeled for Joseph Gulston, the younger, the collector and MP. Ealing Grove had then been owned by 4th Duke of Marlborough (1775) and 5th Duke of Argyll before Baillie bought it in 1791. The 5th Earl of Oxford was the tenant between 1799–1802, and Baillie's heirs sold it in 1811, having had passed a Private Act of Parliament in 1805. By 1800 James Baillie's widow, Mrs. Baillie (Colina), was living at 12 Harley Street, Cavendish Square.\n\nHe married, Grenada, 26 April 1772, Colina or Colin Campbell (1753-) one of the two surviving daughters, co-heiresses, of Colin Roy Campbell, of Glenure (c1708-1752), son of Patrick or John Campbell, 3rd or 4th of Barcaldine, Argyll (1677–1738), by Lucia or Lucy Cameron (1692-) of Loch Eil (Cameron of Locheil), Lochaber, Inverness-shire, daughter of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, 17th Chief of Clan Cameron (1629–1719), who Lord Macaulay termed the \"Ulysses of the Highlands\".\n\nEight months before Colina's birth, on 14 May 1752, her father, Colin \"Redfox\" Campbell, was assassinated at Ballachulish, Lettermore, Argyll, by a member of the Stewart family. This the infamous Appin murder was the base of R. L. Stevenson's Kidnapped. Campbell was Hanoverian factor, or rent collector, for the forfeited estates of Stewart of Ardsheil in Argyllshire, Cameron of Callart, Mamore, and part of that of Cameron of Lochiel. Colina's mother was Janet Mackay (married 1749), daughter of Lt. Col. Hon. Hugh Mackay (son of 3rd Lord Reay) (married 1728) by Elizabeth Mackay, 6th of Bighouse, daughter of George Mackay of Bighouse, Strath Halladale, by Melvich, Sutherland.\n\nColina's elder sister was Louisa Campbell, 8th or Portioner of Bighouse (1751–1835), painted by Henry Raeburn, who had married George Mackay of Handa (1736-) in 1768, and had: Janet Mackay (c 1768-15.3.1857). The present day Bighouse Lodge was built in 1765.\nThe world of Baillie was captured by Thomas Gainsborough in a large (100 x 90 inches) portrait that had been intended for the RA show of 1784. It was bequeathed to the National Gallery by his son, a school-friend of Lord Byron, \"Long Baillie\", Alexander Baillie (1777–1855) in 1855, with provision for it to first be lent to his nephew Matthew James Higgins (1810–1868), aka Jacob Omnium; thus it passed to the national collection (now Tate Britain) in 1868.\n\nAlexander Baillie, drawn by Ingres in 1816, was a close friend of Jørgen von Cappelen Knudtzon (1784–1854), the Norwegian. Bust portraits of both von Cappelen and Baillie were carved by Bertel Thorvaldsen. Alexander Baillie was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Naples in the same grave as writer and kinswoman Harriet Charlotte Beaujolais Campbell (died Naples 2.1848, aged 46), aka Viscountess Tullamore and Countess of Charleville, who had married (Florence, 1821) Charles Bury, 2nd Earl of Charleville, and Francois \"Dominique\" Joseph Loridan, Valet de Chambre to M. Alexander Baillie of Naples, Tuscany (23 April 1780 – 16 April 1853).\n\nIn November 2008 \"Highland News\" (13 November 2008) reported that local MSP David Stewart had raised the issue of Inverness Museum and Art Gallery's loan request of the Baillie family by Gainsborough at the Scottish Parliament's Question Time. He was supported by the then tourism minister Jim Mather, as well as Highland Council convener Sandy Park, Inverness Provost Jimmy Gray and Highland councillor and historian David Alston. Stewart said: \"The painting is controversial because the Baillie family were involved in the slave trade. Following the emancipation of slaves in 1834 they received the equivalent of 5.5 million, which they reinvested in their estates in the Highlands and Islands... and was used to develop the Highlands through establishments like Inverness Royal Academy and the Royal Northern Infirmary. This was the only Highlander that to my knowledge was painted by Gainsborough. However, history should be seen warts and all, it's important that people know what it is. The Baillies played a big part in the development of the Highlands. It's a bit like the Highland Clearances, they are an appalling part of Highland history but people should know about it. Schools could make the painting a research project. If we got the painting on loan this would provide a huge boost to tourism in the Highlands and Islands and attract inward investment. It would be like when Caley Thistle signed Marius Niculae.\"\n\nA version of this portrait which just shows Colina and Colin-Campbell by Gainsborough Dupont, it measures 36.5 x 28 inches, and has been in the Collections of Donaldson (Sir George Hunter Donaldson, Kt.

As a widow she lived at East 79th Street and Knollwood, Long Island, and died 18 November 1927. Charles H. Senff (died 1911, aged 74), of Madison Avenue and 41st street, New York, The Beeches, Whitestone, Long Island, and Curles Neck Farm (5500 acres, with 3000 acres under plantation, and 100 permanent workers. In addition there they were champion breeders of Red Polled Cattle in the USA), was a director of the American Sugar Refining Company, and associate and cousin of Henry Osborne Havemeyer. Charles Henry Senff was the son of Dr. Henry Senff by Susannah Havemeyer, daughter of Frederick C. Havemeyer of the sugar refinery company Havemeyers & Elder, which controlled most of the international sugar market, and evolved into the American Sugar Refining Company. Mr. Senff had a renowned and valuable collection of paintings, which included a Frans Hals portrait and some Corot bathing nymphs. In 1912 the collection was valued at $822,300.\n\nThe baby daughter shown in the Gainsborough portrait was Miss Colin-Campbell Baillie (1782–1830), who married (Marylebone, 8 August 1816), (Royal Guelphic Order). Mrs Lloyd died infamously aged 48 having fallen victim to the dangerous quack John St. John Long (1798–1834). Long was a good painter (nb. his \"The Temptation in the Wilderness\", 1824, in Tate Britain), having been one of the only two known pupils of painter John Martin; however by 1827 he had realised that turpentine served him better as a massage oil for the ladies than mixed with oily pigments and placed on canvas. Exposed as a quack by 1828 he was charged and possibly convicted of Colin-Campbell Lloyd's manslaughter \"on the grounds of gross ignorance, and on other considerations\", but he escaped prison.\n\nA claimant on her behalf, a trustee of her marriage settlement, \"for compensation for the enslaved people on Baillie's Bacolet in Grenada\", was Commander Sir George Young, 2nd Bt., RN, ancestor of the present (2014) UK Government Chief Whip Sir George Young, 6th Baronet, PC, OM.\nTheir daughter:\n\nAnother daughter, Janette Baillie (1773–1841), married Matthew Higgins (d.1814) of Benown, Glassan, Athlone, Westmeath, Ireland, residing in Milan;\n\nMichael Baillie, 3rd Baron Burton was the representative of the family of Baillie of Dochfour until his death in 2013.\n\n"}

On 9 Feb. 1808 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. \n\nSucceeding in 1814 to the whole of his father's property, estimated at £250,000, he developed into a confirmed miser, and the last thirty years of his life were solely employed in accumulating wealth. He lived in a large house, 5 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, but it was so meanly furnished that for some time he had not a bed to lie on. His dress consisted of a blue swallow-tailed coat with gilt buttons, brown trousers, short gaiters, and shoes which were patched and generally down at the heels. He never allowed his clothes to be brushed, because, he said, it destroyed the nap.

Savage), of West Hoboken, New Jersey, one of the two first makers of watch cases in the United States. He remained in Savoye's employ for five years, and soon after attaining his majority, began what an independent career.\n\nFahys bought out the Savoye business on June 1, 1857. He continued it under his own name and moved the factory to the fourth floor of 75 Nassau Street, New York City before later moving the plant to Carlstadt, New Jersey. In 1861, he formed a connection with Fortenbach Brothers (John, Jacob, and Joseph), which resulted in the building at Carlstadt, one of the first establishments in America which manufactured watch cases on an extensive scale; for five years, business was profitable. In 1867, Fahys located a similar factory in Brooklyn in which he associated with Wheeler, Parsons & Hayes, and the joint enterprise was known as the Brooklyn Watch Case Company. When both factories were well under way, Fahys sold his New York store to Ward & Jennings, two of his employees, and gave his undivided attention to his manufacturing interests. In 1876, he bought the share of the Fortenbach Brothers and moved the Carlstadt plant to Sag Harbor, Long Island. For many years he made a specialty of silver watch cases.\n\nHe was president of Joseph Fahys & Co., located in the Fahys Building, on 54 Maiden Lane, New York City; the company was established in 1857. Fahys' son-in-law, Henry Francis Cook, who was president of the Montauk Steamboat Company, became a partner of Fays & Co. in 1880. In 1887, in connection with A. N. Darling, Hayden W. Wheeler, Lewis A. Parsons and Henry Hays, he founded the Brooklyn Watch Case Co. for the manufacture of solid gold cases and retained a dominant interest in this for many years though he devoted his time principally to his own factory at Sag Harbor.\n\nFahys was the founder and first president of the Jewelers' Board of Trade, and the first president of the Watchcase Manufacturers' Association. He was a member of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, the Union League, and the Downtown Association. He was a trustee of the Homoeopathic Hospital, the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. He was director of the Alvin Manufacturing Co., Brooklyn Watch Case Co., Sea View Elevated Railroad Co., and Victoria Fire Insurance Co.\n\nIn 1856, he married a lady who was a native of Sag Harbor. Their son, George Ernest Fahys, who became a partner in the Fahys Co., was born in West Hoboken in 1864. Fahys's daughter, Lena Marianne, married Cook in 1883. \n\nFahys and Cook purchased one thousand acres of land in North Haven, a suburb of Sag Harbor, with two miles of frontage on Peconic Bay. Fahys' Clinton Hill, Brooklyn residences were designed in 1889 and 1890 by Benjamin Wistar Morris, III. Morris also designed Fahys' Long Island country house. Fahys also lived in New York City on Park Avenue. He died at his summer home in Sag Harbor, Long Island.\n"}

She took over Baby Phat after Russell Simmons and was CEO/creative director through 2010. She had her own reality television shows \"\" (2007–2011) and \"Kimora: House of Fab\" (2013).\n\nKimora Lee Perkins was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Her mother, Joanne \"Kyoko\" Perkins, was born in Korea to a Japanese mother and adopted by a U.S. serviceman during the Korean War and raised in the U.S. She later worked as an administrator for Social Security. Kimora's father is African American. Her father, Vernon Whitlock Jr., worked as a Federal Marshal, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigator, a bail bondsman, and later became a barber in St. Louis. He was sentenced to prison when Kimora was in grade school for distribution of narcotics. It was substantiated in the U.S. District Court (Honorable Clyde Cahill) that government agents attempted to recruit Whitlock as an informant in exchange for probation, but he vehemently refused. Consequently, he was refused probation and was taken off his $500,000 bond and was given the 24-year sentence; he was released after five years. Her parents split up and she was raised by her mother.\n\nGrowing up in the northern St. Louis suburb of Florissant, Missouri, Kimora was the target of schoolyard bullying and teasing, because of her height (she was tall by the time she was 10 years old) and mixed ancestry. To give her confidence because of her height, Simmons's mother enrolled her in a modeling class when she was eleven years old. Two years later she was discovered by Marie-Christine Kollock (a representative for seminal Paris Agency Glamour) at a Model Search in Kansas City (organized by Kay Mitchell) and sent to Paris. \nSimmons is a graduate of Lutheran North High School in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nJust after her fourteenth birthday, Perkins was awarded an exclusive modeling contract with Chanel and went to work under the tutelage of Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld. She quickly gained attention in the fashion world when she closed Lagerfeld's haute couture show in 1989. \"Everything people thought was weird about me before\", Perkins told \"People Weekly\", \"was now good\". Perkins soon walked for designers including Fendi, Valentino, Emanuel Ungaro and Yves Saint Laurent. Perkins has been featured on the cover of the German, Indonesian, Singaporean and Malaysian editions of \"Harper's Bazaar\".\n\nIn 2004, Simmons' then husband Russell Simmons sold his clothing line Phat Farm to Kellwood Company for $140 million. When Russell stepped down as CEO of Phat Fashions LLC in September 2007, Simmons—who was already creative director of Baby Phat (which was a branch off Phat Farm Industries)—was promoted by Kellwood to President and Creative Director of Phat Fashions. It was her goal to turn fashion label Baby Phat, launched in 1999, into an \"aspirational lifestyle brand\". Her high-end sportswear line, KLS, launched in fall 2007.\n\nOn September 1, 2010, Simmons parted ways with Baby Phat and its management company, Kellwood. The details as to why Simmons was removed as creative director have not been clear; some blog sites claimed it was because Simmons was spending too much money on company pursuits and giving too much pay to herself and her children. After the split, Simmons planned to launch her KLS collection and Kouture by Kimora Brands. She had an exclusive brand coming to Macy's that would offer stylish clothes for under $40. On September 14, 2011, Simmons announced on her website that she was the new creative director and president of JustFab, a personalized shopping website. She ended her employment with JustFab in May 2015.\n\nIn June 2015, Simmons relaunched her KLS label as a high end line, opening its first boutique in Beverly Hills. In 2016, the line began being carried at Bloomingdale's in the Aventura Mall.\n\nSimmons has appeared in small roles in television and films including \"Beauty Shop\", \"Brown Sugar\", and \"Waist Deep\". She has also appeared in music videos for Ginuwine, Usher and Rich Gang in the 2013 song \"Tapout\".\nIn 2003, Simmons appeared as one of the judges on \"America's Next Top Model, Cycle 1\". She was scheduled to return but later chose not to. She has been a co-host of Sony Television's syndicated talk show \"Life & Style\".\nOn August 5, 2007, season one of her reality TV show, \"\", premiered on Style Network. The show chronicles her daily life and routine as a mother and then-CEO of Phat Fashions.\n\nSimmons wrote a self-help book, \"Fabulosity: What It Is and How to Get It\", that was published by HarperEntertainment in February 2006. The book is set to function as a 'lifestyle manual' on everything from spirituality and finances to fashion and beauty. She has also launched five perfumes for women: \"Goddess\", \"Golden Goddess\", \"Seductive Goddess\", \"Baby Phat Fabulosity\", \"Love me\", and the last fragrance she put out from her time with Baby Phat, \"Dare Me\".\n\nSimmons sponsored the KLS Rushcard, which included her own line of purple Rushcards.\n\nSimmons, a philanthropist, feels a sense of responsibility to give back to communities because of everyone in her childhood that gave her a chance to prove herself. Charitable work is not something she does for fun, she states specifically: \"Whose life have you changed? Who have you helped move forward, grow, and progress?\" Simmons established the Kimora Lee Simmons Scholarship Fund at her high school alma mater in St. Louis to provide college tuition support for academically successful girls with financial needs and is an active member of youth advocacy organizations including Amfar, The G&P Foundation, Keep a Child Alive, Hetrick-Martin Institute and Rush Philanthropic where she is on the Board of Directors. The mayor of St. Louis presented Simmons the key to the city and named March 18, 2008 \"Kimora Day\" in St. Louis.\n\nLee met Russell Simmons in November 1992 during New York City's Fashion Week. She was 17 and about to finish high school; he was 35 and a self-admitted ladies' man. The couple were married by Simmons's brother, rapper and Pentecostal minister, Joseph \"Reverend Run\" Simmons\" of Run-DMC, on the Caribbean island of St. Bart's on December 20, 1998. They have two daughters, Ming Lee Simmons (born January 21, 2000) and Aoki Lee Simmons (born August 16, 2002). The couple separated in March 2006. In March 2008, she filed for divorce from Russell Simmons. Their divorce was finalized in January 2009.\n\nIn March 2007, Simmons was dating actor and model Djimon Hounsou. \nIn the summer of 2008, Simmons and Hounsou participated in a traditional Benin commitment ceremony. On May 30, 2009, Simmons gave birth to their son, Kenzo Lee Hounsou, meaning \"Three\" (Kimora's third child). Simmons and Hounsou, who were never legally married in the United States, announced their separation in November 2012.\n\nIn February 2014, Lee confirmed that she is married to former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner, and had been \"for a while now\". Leissner, a senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker before leaving the firm in the wake of its work with Malaysia's embattled investment fund, has been barred from the U.S. securities industry for failing to provide documents to a regulator. Simmons gave birth in April 2015 to a baby boy named Wolfe Lee Leissner.\n\nIn July 2004, Simmons was arrested and charged with reckless driving, eluding police, driving with a broken brake light, and marijuana possession after a two-mile chase that began near the Saddle River Police Station and ended outside her estate in Saddle River, New Jersey. On August 9, 2005, Simmons pleaded guilty to the reckless driving charge and was placed on six months' probation.\n\n"}

It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. \"Neighbours\" has since become the longest-running series in Australian television and the seventh longest-running serial drama still on the air in the world. In 2005, the show was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.\n\nThe first celebrity to make a guest appearance in the show was former Skyhooks band member Red Symons. He made his on-screen debut ten days after the series began in March 1985. He played the role of Terry Inglis' ex-husband, Gordon. In 1986, record producer Molly Meldrum arrived in Ramsay Street to sign Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue) after hearing her singing backing vocals on a music demo. Greg Fleet's appearance in 1988 saw him run over popular character Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith) with his car, resulting in her death. 1995 saw Chris Lowe, one half of British music group, The Pet Shop Boys, appear and ask Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) and Marlene Kratz (Moya O'Sullivan) for directions to a studio. A year later, writer Clive James had a walk on part as a postman. Australian cricketer, Shane Warne made a two episode appearance as himself in 2006. He came to Erinsborough to pick up a cheque for his charity from Harold Bishop (Ian Smith). \"Australian Idol\" presenter Andrew G made the first of three appearances by the show's stars in February 2007. Judges Marcia Hines and Ian Dickson followed in November 2007 and March 2009 respectively. \n\nDuring three episodes set and filmed in London, a number of British stars filmed cameos, including Neil Morrissey, Emma Bunton, Julian Clary and Michael Parkinson. Morrissey was the only one of the group to play a character and not himself. British comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams appeared as their characters, Lou and Andy and Tim Vine had a small walk on part as a lost tourist. Australian comedians Hamish & Andy made their \"Neighbours\" debut as radio hosts, Fred & Big Tommo and Lehmo had a cameo as himself in July 2010. The Charlie's bar set provides a stage for musicians to perform their songs during episodes. September 2008 saw girl band, The Veronicas sing their song, \"This Love\" on the set and Liverpudlian band, The Wombats sang three of their hits. Other singers and bands to appear at Charlie's, include Kate Ceberano, Ben Lee and former \"Australian Idol\" contestant Jacob Butler. AFL player Clint Bizzell began appearing as footballer Adam Clarke in a storyline that ran for just over a week in March 2009.\n\nDutch violinist André Rieu arrived in Ramsay Street in early April 2009. His cameo was later named \"Neighbours\"' \"weirdest ever storyline\" in an online poll. WWE wrestler Dave Batista signed up to appear in scenes with wrestling fans Callum Jones (Morgan Baker) and Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), during his promotional tour of Australia in June. In the same month, it was announced that British pop singer, Lily Allen, was to make an appearance and perform her new single \"22\" on the show.

A force of 4,000 French soldiers intervened on January 11. Seven days later a cease-fire agreement was signed between Tuareg fighters and government forces; despite continuing and sporadic terrorist attacks the intervention was considered successful.\n\nFrance’s intervention in the Mali conflict came only two years after their involvement in NATO air-strikes against Muammar Gaddafi’s government forces in Libya.\n\nOn January 28th, 2013 al-Matroushi, along with 150 other activists submitted a request to Qatar’s interior ministry to orchestrate a protest in front of the French embassy in Doha. The protest was intended to criticize France’s planned military intervention in Mali.\n\nThe activists’ request to hold a protest was denied. Instead, al-Matroushi and a fellow activist, Mohammad Issa al-Baker, delivered a letter to the embassy which directly addressed the French ambassador. The letter, which would later be described as “threatening” by Qatari authorities, was handed to the French on behalf of 70 activists, whose signatures were not included.\n\nThe tone of the letter in question is undoubtedly hostile towards French presence in not only Mali, but North Africa as well, claiming that “it is common knowledge that the crimes [France] committed in Algeria martyred more than a million Muslim persons”. It goes on to state that France is currently killing and torturing Malian Muslims, describing its policies as “terrorist” and “racist”. Perhaps the letter’s most alarming statement comes in the form of a warning: “We demand that you immediately cease your military campaign in Mali or else you would be exposing yourselves to the wrath of people who love death as much as you love life”.\n\nWithin four days of receiving the letter, the French embassy reported it to Qatari authorities on March 7, but refused to comment publicly.\n\nIn the weeks following delivery of the letter, al-Matroushi had received multiple phone calls from state officials questioning him about his activism and recent activities; he was summoned to report for questioning by authorities but refused. On the 22nd of March both al-Matroushi and al-Baker were arrested by plain clothed officers on their way back from a family trip in Mesaieed (approximately 30 miles south of Doha).\n\nThe two men were held in solitary confinement with no official charge, and were re-questioned about the nature of the letter. Sultan al-Khalaifi, a fellow-activist, was quoted defending the letter, saying “the letter we sent to the French embassy carried no threat. It was advice”. Al-Khalaifi was previously associated with Alkarama after his 2011 arrest by Qatari authorities.\n\nAfter numerous appeals and petitions sent by Amnesty International and other human rights groups, the two men were released on April 18, but were subject to a travel-ban. Al-Matroushi later requested permission to travel to Egypt in order to pursue his education which was granted.\n\nAl-Matroushi’s close associate, al-Baker, has been tied to two U.S. designated al-Qaeda financiers and a purported charity that served as a fundraising mechanism for the Al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria).\n\nDespite his alleged travel ban, Al-Baker appears in a video of a 2014 aid shipment into Syria (14), furthermore a video was uploaded from Bakr’s Twitter account which appears to have been recorded in Turkey. The video promotes Madad Ahl al-Sham, featuring collections and deliveries intended for Syria. Madad Ahl al-Sham was openly endorsed by Nusra Front fighters as well the group’s official social media accounts.\n\nAl-Baker also posted to his Twitter account the phone numbers of Sa’ad bin Sa’ad al-Ka’abi and Abd al-Latif bin 'Abdullah al-Kawari. Both al-Ka’abi and al-Kawari were designated as al-Qaeda financiers and facilitators in 2015.\n\nAdditionally, Al-Matroushi is associated with Alkarama, which advocated for Matroushi during his detention by authorities. The organization itself has been listed as a terrorist entity by the United Arab Emirates and two of its three founding members, Abdel Rahman al-Nuaymi and Abdul Wahab al-Humayqani, have been designated by the United States government as financiers of terror in 2013. Moreover, Alkarama’s legal director, Rachid Mesli, was arrested in Italy on August 19, 2015 under an Algerian warrant through Interpol for his connection to the Islamic Salvation Front.\n"}
{"id": "254877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254877", "title": "Minnie the Minx", "text": "Minnie the Minx\n\nMinnie the Minx, whose real name is Hermione Makepeace, is a British comic strip and comic strip character published in the comic magazine \"The Beano\". Created and originally drawn by Leo Baxendale, she first appeared in issue 596, dated 19 December 1953, making her the third longest running Beano character, behind only Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger.\n\nLike Desperate Dan from \"The Dandy\", she has a statue in Dundee.\n\nMinne the Minx, created and drawn by Leo Baxendale, first appeared in \"The Beano\" in December 1953. Her first strip introduced her as \"wild as wild can be\" and showed her exasperated mother attempting to get her to be more creative rather than fight. Taking the book, Minnie then proceeds to beat her classmates during a revenge scheme using the scrapbook as a weapon. The closing panel shows her thanking her mother for the scrapbook stating she has \"won nine scraps with it.\" Most of Minnie's earlier strips consisted of six-panel boxes; however, as her popularity grew, it quickly became more plausible to give Minnie her own full page with added colour. This introduced her trademark flaming red hair and red and black jersey. Like many other \"Beano\" stars at the time, many of her later strips showed Minnie to get her comeuppance towards the end be it a cane, slipper or simply a case of karma. Minnie also appeared alongside Dennis the Menace in his own strip in the edition of 23 January 1954 of The Beano. In the strip, she swapped toys with Dennis for the day as she received his trusty catapult and he proceeded to 'menace' with her doll's pram. In the end, she got out of trouble scot free whilst Dennis had to suffer for all her minxing. It was possibly this that began their future eternal rivalry.\n\nIn 1962, when Baxendale left D.C. Thomson, a new artist was taken on to continue Minnie's adventures. Young art teacher Jim Petrie was given the opportunity. His first strip, coincidentally, started similarly to Baxendale's in that Minnie is seen being asked by her mother to read rather than minx. Much to her mother's dismay, Minnie's chosen book influences her to take up red Indian traditions in which she gets up to much mischief. In the end, however, after aggravating a sleeping bull Minnie is caught by a farmer and taken home to be slippered by her father. Despite the pain, it appears Minnie still attempts to ensure to the public that she is still an Indian stating her name is 'Minnie – Ha!'. She appeared once again alongside Dennis in issue 1894, in which she states that Dennis' famous jersey are actually her trademark thus he has no right to call them 'Dennis Jerseys'.\n\n\"The Beano\"s 50th Anniversary issue in 1988 was significant, as an increase in the number of colour pages in the comic led to Minnie appearing in full colour for the first time. In the strip itself, Minnie dressed up as Pansy Potter in compliance with the editor's wishes. Throughout the strip she attempts impossible feats in hope to appear just like Pansy. This even consists of attempting to sink war submarines, something the old character used to do during The Beano's war times. Despite the fact she is weaker than Pansy, Minnie does manage to with-hold four sailors before they finally manage to catch her and tie her up leaving her before her father. However, previously she had filled her father's jumper with balloons and using Pansy's unique hairstyle, manages to burst the balloons causing her father to flee home in the nude, the thought of punishing his daughter forgotten.\n\nMinnie also made a cameo in the 1992 \"Beano Annual\" story, \"Dennis Through The Beano Book\", in which she played the Queen of Hearts. She has also been the star of several Beanotown pantomimes, playing the role of Cinderella in each.\n\nWith the turn of the new century, Minnie was featured in a feature-length strip alongside Dennis the Menace, Roger the Dodger and The Bash Street Kids. The plot revolved around treasure which was apparently buried sometime near the end of the 19th century. Minnie was called over to Dennis' house by Roger who had gained a copy of the Treasure Map due to Smiffy, the dipsy member of The Bash Street Kids, leaving the original in the photocopier machine in Beanotown Library. Upon finding out The Bash Street Kids were also hunting for the treasure, the trio followed them to London. Once the mystery had unfolded that the treasure was buried deep in the Millennium Dome and the Bash Street Kids instantly found it and celebrated their victory. However, Dennis attempts to intimidate the treasure off of Fatty but it quickly flattened leaving Minnie and Roger to chase after Danny, who had just ran with the treasure. Finding him hiding in a storage cupboard, Roger forms a plan to get Danny to duel with Dennis for the treasure. Whilst all seems fair at first, it is quickly discovered that the three menaces had no intent on fair play when it comes to treasure and it is revealed that Roger had in fact tied Danny's catapult to a piece of string thus yanking it away at a pinnacle moment. Appearing to have won, the trio leave a humiliated Danny and head home. However, a plot quickly unravels that Roger wasn't the only one who was intent on unfair play. Danny had switched the treasure with pebbles whilst hiding in the storage cupboard. Alongside Dennis, Minnie chased Roger through the streets of Beanotown for giving Danny the opportunity to switch the treasure.\n\nMinnie also attended Dennis the Menace's 50th Birthday House Party. Like the other guests, Minnie bought Dennis a \"Beano Annual\" 2001. She participated in all menacing party games but due to her friendship with Dennis she was one of few to not get menaced. She can also be seen fighting in the final food fight and twirling her beret when the celebrities and Dandy characters arrive.\n\nPetrie decided to retire with his final strip appearing on 13 January 2001. The story consisted of Minnie meeting her former artist and bidding farewell. The strip was Petrie's 2000th and last, a tally for one artist drawing the same strip in the Beano only surpassed by David Sutherland on the Bash Street Kids.\n\nThe following week, Calamity James artist Tom Paterson took over the strip adding his own distinct trademarks and ideas on Minnie's canon. In 2003, Brain Duane from The Dandy visited Beanotown and proceeded to mock Minnie for her lack of intelligence. Choosing brawn over brains and fuelled with jealousy over Duane's new gadget-filled car, Minnie threatened Duane into making her a custom-built skateboard. The next week, after asking to meet Dennis she proceeds to minx him with her new weapon filled vehicle. This causes Dennis to get his revenge the next week with his own Menace Buggy. It was revealed in succeeding issues that this, along with several other strips from around the same time, was a buildup to a brand new PC Game Beanotown Racing. She appeared as a playable character in the video game upon its release date in 2003.\n\nInitially Paterson drew the vast majority of strips, with the occasional story drawn by Keith Reynolds, but by 2003 other artists such as Leslie Reavey began to ghost the strip due to Tom Paterson's workload. Through 2004 and 2005 ghosted strips became increasingly common, and eventually in early 2006 Steve Horrocks took up the artistic duties. However, in the autumn of that year Paterson returned to the strip but in a different style, the most notable change being that Minnie's Parents appeared to look very similar to those of Sweeney Toddler. However, the following year Tom Paterson's style changed again, and the changes made to her parents were largely reversed, although Minnie's Dad's moustache was still absent. In October 2007, Minnie's jumper changed colour from her familiar black and red stripes to red and yellow, with her skirt also changing from black to blue. This style was also seen on the cover of the 1965 Beano book.\n\nBy 2007, Minnie was struggling in the readers' poll, and in early 2008 several significant changes were made in response to this. Iain McLaughlin took over as writer, and in Beano issue 3422, dated 15 March 2008, former Desperate Dan artist Ken Harrison took over as the strip's artist. Harrison re-introduced many aspects of Leo Baxendale's original depiction of the character and reverted her jumper to its original colours. However, the style of writing changed, with McLaughlin placing greater emphasis on the relationship between Minnie and her Dad. Some minor changes were made to her appearances, with her standard brown or grey school shoes replaced with the more modern trainers. A new tagline was introduced, citing Minnie as the World's Wildest Tom Boy, similar to Dennis the Menace's original tagline of being the World's Wildest Boy. Minnie's Teacher also became a regular character during this time, and Minnie now attends what appears to be an all-girls school. The changes reinvigorated the strip as Minnie soon returned to a top four position in the poll.\n\nAlthough Harrison has been the main artist throughout this time, when he has been unavailable to draw the strip the main ghost artist has been Laura Howell. Since 2009, occasional Jim Petrie reprints have been used, particularly during the postal strikes in autumn 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Minnie began a quest for fame which received a lot of media attention in the UK. Cheryl Cole, who was spotted sporting a red and black dress in her music video, was featured as well as Wayne Rooney and Jamie Oliver. Each attempt landed Minnie in more trouble than the last so in her final strip she decided to give up the search for fame and instead continue her day-to-day minxing.\n\nOn 30 July 2011, Minnie and several of her Beano co-stars were a part of a UK advertising campaign for National Trust. This included a special of The Beano which included a comic strip of her and her father exploring Northern Ireland for Finn McCool and Giant's Causeway.\n\nIn November 2012, Minnie loses her second page as it is reserved for Funsize Funnies (Gnash Gnews, Little Plum, Winston and Rasher)\n\nKen Harrison drew his last Minnie the Minx strip in November 2012, drawing the first Minnie story reduced down to a single page. The week after Nigel Parkinson took over from Ken Harrison and has continued from then on, confirming he was the new Minnie artist on his blog. For the 75th anniversary special, Minnie the Minx met Andy Murray in a tennis battle. Minnie also met Harry Hill, Jeremy Clarkson and Matt Smith (plus others) in the 2013 Comic Relief special. In 2014, Minnie stories went back up to two pages, with Nigel Parkinson and Cavan Scott writing the scripts.\n\nPaul Palmer Did almost two years before handing the job over To Laura Howell, The first ever woman to draw Minnie.\n\nThe first ever woman to draw Minnie is the current artist As Minnie's 65th Year in the comic comes closer\n\nMinnie is known as a typical tomboy, preferring mischievous and violent antics over those that would be normal for a typical ten-year-old girl. As opposed to Dennis' boisterous menacing methods, Minnie favours a more impish style of causing trouble which she refers to as 'minxing'. Despite this, she is still keen to get into brawls much like her other fellow Beano characters. She also seems to have a distinct hatred for snob-like behaviour and spoilt children. Minnie can be deemed as hyperactive as evident in several strips which show her destroying furniture in her home or a shop whilst playing one of her games. She also considers herself to be a rebel citing she \"hates\" people telling her what to do.\n\nMinnie has had a problem with many of her neighbours. One example is a baby called Delilah, who had a snob of a mother. She got Minnie plenty of punishments, including extra baths. Minnie defeated her by tricking her into eating a frighteningly hot curry and embarrassing her mother. The mother had just entered Delilah in a baby contest. The curry effect on Delilah happened at the time her boastful mother had arranged for a journalist to take her photo. Her mother was similar to another mother called \"Mrs Proudpants\" who was boasting about her baby who she said was sure to win the contest, just like Delilah's mother. She also appears to have a small rivalry with The Bash Street Kids, as shown in feature-length strips drawn by Mike Pearse. However, she seems to be on friendly terms with the female member, Toots.\n\nMinnie, like most characters, is depicted as a loner; however, she is shown to have a friendship with Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger, often seen teaming up with them in crossovers and occasionally with them in the background. Some strips have even hinted at her having a crush on Dennis and a flash-forward in the Beano Annual of 2006 revealed Dennis and Minnie eventually get married, though the canonicity of this story is debatable and two have yet to pursue a romantic interest in one another in the regular strips.\n\nLike most DC Thomson characters, Minnie's parents are never mentioned by name; and are referred to simply as Minnie's dad and Minnie's mum. However, in issue 2258 (dated 26 October 1985), her dad reveals that his name is 'Victor'. It is unlikely this is any kind of official name, however. In the Beano Videostars it is said by his boss that Minnie's Dad's name is George, but once again it's unlikely it's an official name.\n\nChester is Minnie's pet cat. Chester has occasionally been seen in separate strips alongside fellow feline Beano characters Dodgecat (Roger the Dodger's pet cat) and Winston (from the Bash Street Kids).\n\nFatty Fudge as his name suggests is a fat child. He is also sometimes called upon to assist Minnie in a particularly elaborate plot since his services can always be bought with a bag of sweets. He was briefly the subject of a spin-off strip in the early 1990s that parodied famous films, usually in ways involving the character's love of food (examples including 'You Only Eat Rice' and '20,000 Leeks Under The Sea').\n\nSoppy Susan a character similar to Walter the Softy but a girl. The character appeared during Jim Petrie's time as the artist and has recently returned to the strip, as well as appearing in the 2015 Beano annual.\n\nThe Haarm twins two twins who often tease Minnie but usually end up being beaten up by her. The characters began appearing in the 2000s and appear irregularly.\n\nPC Thyme is a policeman similar to Dennis the Menace's Sergeant Slipper but this character pre-dates him. This character like the aforementioned Soppy Susan mainly appeared during Jim Petrie's time as artist however a similar character appeared during Tom Paterson's time as the Minnie artist called PC Pimple this character was similar to PC Thyme but as the name suggests had pimples.\n\nMinnie's Teacher is as the name suggests Minnie's teacher this character is one of the newest recurring characters in the strip only appearing since Ken Harrison took over as the artist. It was revealed in Issue 3636 that she was 31. Recently, Minnie has been seen as being in Mrs Creecher's class alongside Dennis the Menace.\n\nSince her debut in 1953, Minnie has been hallowed as a national treasure amongst British children for generations. Long considered one of the readers' favourite characters, she was created during what many fans feel is the Beano's golden age where other famous characters were created such as Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger. Alongside the Dandy's Desperate Dan, she was given her own statue in Dundee in 2001. She was also featured in the line-up of McDonald's happy meal toys in Britain and has several models and figurines. As well as featuring on much of the Beano Merchandise, such as T-shirts and figures, Minnie is often featured in the comic's countless spin-offs such as videos, annuals and video games.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The band formed in the early 1960s under the name The Popbeams, which they changed before the release of their first album which they recorded while still in their teens. The duo's true identities are most likely known only to a few individuals at Silence Records, the record label that the band has worked with since 1971. Philemon Arthur and the Dung do not want their identities to be known, lest those who live in their small village find out who they are.\nThe band's music is recorded on reel-to-reel tape decks with crackling microphones and is played on untuned guitars, drums, and accordions, with the occasional accompaniment of household objects such as saucepans, chairs, and radiators. The lyrics vary from utter nonsense, such as profoundly whimsical observations about everyday life, to satire concerning social phenomena such as homelessness, pollution, and hunting.\n\nDespite their outsider-persona, the band has received much notice across Sweden. Their surrealistic self-titled debut won a Swedish Grammy for the best Swedish LP of 1971, which came to the dismay of many. \n\nModern Swedish bands like their fellow Scanians bob hund have been greatly inspired by Philemon Arthur and the Dung, and it was this eccentric duo who discovered and forwarded bob hund's demo tape to Silence Records. \n\nMagnus Uggla's cover of \"In Kommer Gösta\" was credited to M.

He inherited the title of Earl of Chesterfield on the death of his grandfather in 1656. He was educated by Poliander, Professor of Divinity at Leyden (1640) and at the Prince of Orange's College at Breda. In 1669 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Laws by the University of Oxford.\n\nHis first marriage was to Lady Anne Percy, daughter of the Earl of Northumberland. Following her death, a marriage had been arranged between him and Mary, daughter of Anne and 3rd Lord Fairfax. Despite the fact the banns had been read twice, Mary jilted Chesterfield for the 2nd Duke of Buckingham with whom she had fallen in love. Chesterfield subsequently married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde and his wife, Elizabeth Preston. They had one daughter, Lady Elizabeth (from whom descends Queen Elizabeth II), but it is not certain that Chesterfield was the father. Elizabeth died in 1665, and he married a third time to the second daughter of Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon, Lady Elizabeth Dormer, who finally provided him with two sons.\n\nAccording to Samuel Pepys, Chesterfield was a ladies' man, and had been one of the many lovers of Barbara Villiers, the most notorious mistress of King Charles II. His second wife, tired of his neglect, began flirting with the king's brother, the Duke of York, and also with James Hamilton.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for wounding Captain John Whalley in a duel (1658) and on suspicion of involvement in Sir George Booth's rising (1659). He also killed a man in a duel, fled to France, and having obtained pardon from Charles II, returned to England in his train (1660).\n\nHe was Lord Chamberlain to Catherine of Braganza (1662–1665) and a member of her Council (1670). He was Colonel of a regiment of foot (1667, 1682), a Privy Councillor (1681) and the Warden of the royal forests south of Trent (1679). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1708. He died at his home in Middlesex, and was buried in Shelford, Nottinghamshire.\n\n\nList of deserters from James II to William of Orange\n"}

He is senior pastor of World Harvest Church, a large Pentecostal church in Canal Winchester, Ohio; a suburb of Columbus, which has a sister campus in Elkhart, Indiana.\n\nParsley is the founder and chancellor of Valor Christian College. He is the founder and president of The Center for Moral Clarity, a Christian grassroots advocacy organization, as well as the founder of Breakthrough (a media ministry), the Bridge of Hope missions organization, Harvest Preparatory School, World Harvest Ministerial Alliance, The Women's Clinic of Columbus, and , a 24/7 online streaming channel. His television program, \"Breakthrough with Rod Parsley\", airs daily on the Daystar TV Network, the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and The Word Network.\n\nParsley was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and was raised primarily in the Columbus area. His parents had grown up in eastern Kentucky, and his family traveled there often to visit relatives when Parsley was a young boy. He was raised as a Free Will Baptist, and had a \"born-again\" experience at Christian Center Church in Gahanna, Ohio, in the 1970s. \n\nAfter graduating from high school, he worked in real estate and at a pet-food factory. He enrolled at Circleville Bible College (now Ohio Christian University), but dropped out after two years.\n\nAs a young pastor, Parsley was strongly influenced by Dr. Lester Sumrall, an Indiana-based evangelist, missionary and broadcaster. Sumrall became Parsley's mentor, and the two traveled together often. \n\nHe is married to Joni Parsley. They have a son, Austin, and a daughter, Ashton, now grown. They live near Pickerington, a suburb of Columbus.\n\nParsley founded his church in 1977, after leading a Bible study in his parents' back yard while still a college student. Seventeen people attended the first meeting. They soon decided that the Bible study group should become a church. It originally became known as Sunset Chapel, and later Word of Life Church. \n\nThe church's first permanent facility was built in 1979. This is now known as Alpha Hall, one of four buildings on what for many years was the campus of Valor Christian College (the college moved to the main church campus in 2011). Growth soon required an addition to that building, and several years later the church built a bigger structure adjacent to Alpha Hall, now known as Dominion Hall. In 1986, ground was broken on to begin what is now the church's main campus in Canal Winchester (with a Columbus address). When it was dedicated, it was renamed as World Harvest Church in honor of Lester Sumrall, who had befriended Parsley years earlier and became the younger pastor's mentor.\n\nWorld Harvest Church Columbus now includes a 5,200-seat sanctuary, children's and youth ministries, Connect Centers and administrative offices. Harvest Preparatory School, a private Christian school serving students in preschool through grade 12, and Valor Christian College also operate on the church grounds. About 10,000 people attend services at World Harvest on a weekly basis.\n\nIn 2013, World Harvest added a satellite campus in Elkhart. That church is located near Christian Center Church in South Bend, the church founded by Parsley's mentor, Sumrall.\n\n\"Breakthrough\" is an outreach of Bridge of Hope, an international missions organization. Over the past 20 years, Parsley has led numerous humanitarian projects around the world, supported by gifts from his church members, churches affiliated with the World Harvest Ministerial Alliance and television viewers. Bridge of Hope has an exhaustive record of work in Sudan, where a civil war has persisted for years. His involvement with Sudan began with his lobbying for the federal Sudan Peace Act, and has encompassed the purchase of freedom for Sudanese Christian slaves as well as food, medical supplies and equipment for freed slaves. Bridge of Hope has purchased the freedom of more than 31,000 slaves and provided more than 16,000 \"survival kits\" — aid packages consisting of a tarp, mosquito netting, a cooking pot and food to sustain a family for a month.\n\nBridge of Hope has also completed projects in the African nations of Zambia, Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique. The organization's history also includes projects in Europe, Asia, South America, Central America and the Caribbean. its most recent international projects have been in Haiti (both before and after the January 2010 earthquake there) and Guatemala.\n\nDomestically, Bridge of Hope has been involved in disaster relief, providing food, water, ice and cleaning supplies in the wake of disasters including Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav and Ike. Following these disasters, Bridge of Hope was named a First Responder by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nValor Christian College was founded in 1990 as World Harvest Bible Institute, and was later known as World Harvest Bible College. It attracts students from across the United States and around the world for ministry training in pastoral leadership, missions, evangelism, music ministry, youth ministry, media ministry, advanced leadership and interdisciplinary studies. It is accredited by the Ohio Department of Higher Education to offer associate of applied science degrees.\n\nParsley is a political independent. He is a critic of liberal positions on social issues, including abortion and the movement to expand the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples. He has also worked on behalf of prison re-entry legislation, women's rights initiatives and anti-poverty programs. His most recent book, \"Living on Our Heads\", singles out Chris Matthews, Bart Stupak, Mia Farrow and the late Christopher Hitchens for praise.\n\nParsley became increasingly involved in U.S. politics following his work on the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. During the summer of 2004, Parsley announced the establishment of the Center for Moral Clarity. He openly criticized Sweden for the conviction of Åke Green under Sweden's hate crimes legislation.\n\nOn October 3, 2004, Parsley gave a sermon titled \"Uncensored: While Freedom Still Rings\". In the two-part sermon, Parsley expressed opposition to the view that there is a separation of church and state in the U.S. Constitution; same-sex marriage; partial-birth abortion; hate speech legislation in California, Canada, and Sweden; sexual orientation themes in children's books; racism; and poverty. Parsley has said that the U.S. government, by funding Planned Parenthood, is complicit in black genocide, that is, genocide against African Americans, because Planned Parenthood performs abortions in the black community.\n\nA few weeks before the 2004 elections, Parsley encouraged both his congregation and his television audience to vote for Ohio's state constitutional amendment which defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. The amendment passed by a wide margin of votes from both political parties. Parsley has also encouraged citizens of other states with similar marriage amendments on their ballots to vote similarly, and he headlined the \"Silent No More\" tour in order to register Christian voters.\n\nParsley is an author of several books, including \"Silent No More,\" which was released in April 2005 by Charisma House. The book encourages Christians to participate in the political process, and especially to make sure their votes reflect their values. Concerning poverty, Parsley writes that government should \"get out of the way,\" removing many constraints on capitalism. \"If the government were to reduce the level of taxation, remove industrial restraints, eliminate wage controls, and abolish subsidies, tariffs, and other constraints on free enterprise,\" he writes, \"the poor would be helped in a way that AFDC, social security, and unemployment insurance could never match.\"\n\nThe sequel, \"Culturally Incorrect: How Clashing Worldviews Affect Your Future\", was published in June 2007 and soon appeared on the industry's best-seller lists. \"Culturally Incorrect\" identifies postmodernism - the belief that there is no such thing as absolute truth - as the cause of many of the culture's major ills, and calls upon Christians to impact the culture through prayer, service to the poor and activism. A third book on Christian moral action, \"Living on Our Heads: Righting an Upside-Down Culture,\" was released in August 2010.\n\nHis latest book is called \"The Finale: One World, One Ruler, One Reign,\" released in April 2017.\n\nParsley personally endorsed the presidential campaign of Republican nominee John McCain, who called Parsley a \"spiritual guide\". McCain had actively sought Parsley's endorsement during his Republican primary battle with Mike Huckabee, who was drawing substantial support from the religious right.\n\nMcCain later rejected Parsley's endorsement based on Parsley's statements regarding Islam. Parsley was quoted as stating that he \"do[es] not believe that our country can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand America was founded, in part, with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed\" and that Muhammad is \"the mouthpiece of a conspiracy of spiritual evil\".\n\nIn repudiating Parsley's comments, McCain stated, \"I believe there is no place for that kind of dialogue in America, and I believe that even though he endorsed me, and I didn't endorse him, the fact is that I repudiate such talk, and I reject his endorsement.\" McCain further distanced himself from Parsley, stating, \"I've never been in Pastor Hagee's church or Pastor Parsley's church. I didn't attend their church for 20 years, and I'm not a member of their church. I received their endorsement, which did not mean that I endorsed their views.\"\n\nThereafter, Parsley withdrew his endorsement of McCain's candidacy.\n\nParsley is identified as a prominent player in the so-called dominionist movement by both TheocracyWatch and commentator Bill Moyers.\n\nSome have criticized Parsley's recent book, \"Silent No More\", because of the book's description of Islam and its view that the United States Constitution provides for a separation of church and state (among other social issues), and for his support of faith healing. Parsley supports the claim that Islam is an enemy of both the United States and Christianity.\n\nIn January 2006, a group of 31 Columbus, Ohio-area pastors charged that Parsley and another central Ohio religious leader had violated federal tax laws. The complaining clergy alleged that Parsley violated the tax-exempt status of his church by supporting various political causes.\n\nAuthor Chris Hedges' 2006 book \"American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War on America\" quoted Parsley as using militaristic metaphors in a sermon concerning his critics:\n\nIn 2015, Parsley was treated for throat cancer, but has since recovered.\n\n"}

{"id": "57005854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57005854", "title": "Sebile", "text": "Sebile\n\nSebile, alternatively written as Sedile, Sebille, Sibilla, Sibyl and other similar names, is a mythical medieval queen or princess who is frequently portrayed as a fairy or an enchantress in the Arthurian legends and Italian folklore. She appears in a variety of roles, from the most faithful and noble lady to a wicked seductress, often in relation with or substituting for the character of Morgan le Fay. Some tales feature her as a wife of either King Charlemagne or Prince Lancelot, and even as the mother of King Arthur.\n\nThe character of Sebile has her earliest roots in the Ancient Greek figure of the priestess prophetess known as the Cumaean Sibyl. This was later transmuted into a Christianized character named Sibyl in the Christian mythology of the Early Middle Ages.\n\nQueen Sebile first appears in text in the Matter of France's \"Chanson des Saisnes\" (\"The Song of the Saxons\", written c. 1200) as the young and beautiful second wife (a daughter in later versions) of the Saxon king named Guiteclin or Geteclin (representing the historical Widukind), who fights against the Franks. Queen Sebile falls in love with the Frankish king Charlemagne's nephew and Roland's brother, Baudoin, for whom she betrays her husband. After Guiteclin is killed, she marries Baudoin, who thus becomes the King of Saxony.\n\nLater versions from various countries present her instead as a daughter of either King Desiderius of Lombardy in \"Macaire ou la Reine Sebile\", the Emperor of Constantinople in \"La Chanson de la Reine Sibile\" and Willem Vorsterman's \"Historie vander coninghinnen Sibilla\", or the pagan king Agolant in \"La Reine Sebile\". This Sebile marries not Baudoin, but Charlemagne himself.\n\nSebile makes her first known appearance in an Arthurian legend in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's late 12th-century German poem \"Lanzelet\", in which the loving fairy mistress of Prince Lancelot is named Iblis (\"Yblis\"), an anagram for Sibil/Sybil. There, she is the only daughter of Iweret of the Beautiful Forest (\"Beforet\"), an enemy of the family of Lancelot's foster mother, the sea fairy Queen of the Maidenland. Iblis is the most virtuous woman, as proven by a magic cloak test (an arguably central motif of the entire tale), who falls in love with Lancelot in a prophetic dream before even meeting him. After Lancelot slays her father in combat (she faints when he fights and instantly forgives him after his victory) and he learns his name and real identity, Princess Iblis marries him as the new king of this realm. Lancelot later leaves to defeat hundred knights and marry the Queen of Pluris (marrying for the fourth time), but eventually escapes from her and returns to the faithful Iblis and their kingdom. Ruling their combined lands together, they have four children, and later they both die on the same day.\n\nIn the early 13th-century French epic poem \"Huon de Bordeaux\", Sebile is a cousin of the story's eponymous hero, the Frankish knight Huon of Bordeaux. She uses her magical abilities to aid Huon in slaying her captor: a monstrous, 17-foot-tall giant named Pride (\"l'Orgueilleux\"), whom Huon defeats and beheads after a terrible duel. In \"La Chanson d'Esclarmonde\", one if the continuations of \"Huon\", Sebile is one of the three fay mentioned by name when summoned by the fairy queen Morgue (Morgan le Fay), Lady of the Hidden Isle (Avalon), to welcome Huon and Esclarmonde, his lover and daughter of the Emir of Babylon.\n\nIn the early 13th-century French Lancelot-Grail prose cycle, Queen Sebile (\"Sedile le roine\") or Sebile the enchantress (\"Sebile l'enchanteresse\") becomes a villainous character. She takes part in the kidnapping of Lancelot by her, Morgan le Fay (\"Morgue la fee\"), and the Queen of Sorestan. This story was made well known through Thomas Malory's retelling in his popular \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", where the three queens became four: Queen Morgan of Gore (Gorre, Rheged), and the unnamed Queens of Norgales (\"North Galys\"), Eastland, and the Outer Isles; the Queens of Eastland and Sorestan appear identical in both versions, so Sebile seems to be the Queen either of North Galys or the Outer Isles in Malory's tale. They are described as the most powerful female mages in the world after the Lady of the Lake. Sebile, the youngest of them, is noted as so expert at sorcery that she had managed to render Cerberus harmless during her visit to Hell. All three or four queens, riding together, find the young Lancelot asleep by an apple tree (apples being a symbol of enchantment in the legends). Amazed by how fairy-like handsome he is, they argue over who among them would be the most deserving of his love for reasons other than their equal social rank and magical powers (at least in the French original version, as Malory turns Morgan into a clearly dominant leader of the group). Each of them states different reasons to be chosen, with Sebile emphasizing her merry character, youth and beauty. The Queens consider waking up Lancelot to ask him to choose among them, but Morgan advises that they take him still asleep to their castle, where they can hold him in their power. The next day, the Queens appear before the awoken Lancelot in their finest clothes and ask him to choose one of them as a lover; if he refuses, he will never leave his prison. Despite this threat, Lancelot, faithful to his secret beloved, Queen Guinevere, categorically and with contempt refuses all three \"lewd witches\". Humiliated and angered by this, the queens throw Lancelot into a dungeon; he is later freed by the daughter of the King of Norgales' enemy (either the Duke of Rochedon or King Bagdemagus of Gore), who asks him to fight for her father in an upcoming tournament.\n\nIn the Venician \"Les Prophéties de Merlin\" (written c. 1276), Sebile is part of a quartet of enchantresses: besides Sebile and Morgan (Morgain, \"Morghain\", \"Morghe\"), here being her only lover among all the women, they include also the Queen of Norgales and the Lady of Avalon (\"Dame d'Avalon\"). They all are former students of Merlin, who had received dark magic powers through his demonic origin, and are also in good relations with the extremely villainous knight Brehus (\"Brehus sans pitié\", Brehus without Mercy). Sebile remains a powerful sorceress, whose special skills include invisibility, but is clearly inferior to the Lady; this is evidenced in the episode where Sebile and the Queen of the Norgales together attack the Lady's castle with their magic (in Sebile's case, trying to set it on fire) without any real effect, while the Lady retaliates by effortlessly taking their clothes off and making the naked Sebile visible for all. Morgan too is greater in her magic and seems to be in a master-to-disciple relationship with the younger Sebile, but they are equal in their lust. The two are usually inseparable companions, but this is tested when they become rivals to seduce the widowed knight known as Berengier of Gomeret or Bielengier the Handsome (\"Bielengiers li Biaus\"), who first spends a night with Sebile but then leaves to marry one of Morgan's ladies, the virgin Flour de Lis (Lily Flower), who had kidnapped his child for Morgan. This results in a quarrel that goes from an exchange of worst insults to a physical brawl that leaves Morgan battered half to death by the younger Sebile; the Queen of Norgales then saves the remorseful and terrified Sebile from Morgan's revenge by reminding Morgan how they both stole Lancelot's brother Ector de Maris from her but she had forgiven them, and Morgan and Sebile soon fully reconcile. There are also other knights that Sebile is known to desire, especially Lamorak.\n\nIn the French text known as the \"Livre d'Artus\" (\"Book of Arthur\", written c. 1280), Sebile (Sebille) is a beautiful pagan queen of the Fairy Realm (\"la Terre Fae\") Sarmenie, who has just lost her husband. Queen Sebile has an affair with Arthur's knight Sagramore (Sagremor), who is at first her prisoner until he seduces her. Sagramore converts Sebile to Christianity when she hastily baptizes herself after he refuses to sleep with a heathen. An evil knight known as the Faery Black Knight (\"Le Noir Chevalier Faé\", \"Cheualiers Faez\") or Baruc the Black (\"Baruc li Noirs\") is revealed as the killer of her previous husband in order to marry her himself. The villain is defeated in great battle and captured after a personal duel against Sagramore with Sebile's help. Sebile then marries Sagramore, who stays with her for 15 days before leaving to resume his quest. \n\nIn the anonymous French prose romance \"Perceforest\" (written c. 1330), the most beautiful, wise and honorable enchantress Sebile is known variably as Sebile of the Lake (\"Sebile du Lac\") or the Lady of the Lake, Sebile of the Red Castle (\"Dame du Lac, Sebile du Chastel Vermei\"). In this tale, King Arthur is the son of Sebile and Alexander (derived from Alexander the Great). Alexander is at first a young knight before becoming King Alexander of England and then battling to conquer the world. Sebile falls in love with Alexander on sight; she incites him into her mist-concealed Castle of the Lake (later the Red Castle) by magic and keeps him there through seduction. Their mutual love then grows, especially after Sebile nurses him back to health from a grave wound and Alexander lifts a siege of her castle by defeating her enemies. In one episode, travelling Sebile is attacked by four evil knights who want to rape her, but the Scottish knight Tor of Pedrac arrives at the last moment and slays the villains (their severed heads are then preserved with a spell and given to him as a memorial of this deed). After Alexander dies, Sebile marries Vestige of Joy (the knight of the Black Eagle) and gives him a daughter named Alexandre, also known as the Maiden of the Two Dragons. Other characters include her cousin Gloriane, the lady of Castle Darnant.\n\nAnother Sebile later appears at the end of the 14th century in the French \"Le Roman d'Eledus et Serene\" as a maidservant of the heroine Serene, \"versed in the science of love\". Serene and Sebile are considered doublets.\n\nIn central Italy, Sebile features in a local version of the Venusberg motif from Germanic mythology. In \"The Paradise of Queen Sebile\" (\"Le Paradis de la Reine Sebile\", \"Il paradise della regina Sibilla\"), Antoine de la Sale records a folk legend that he heard from locals at the aptly-named mountain Monte Sibilla in 1420: Sebile/Sibilla is depicted as a demonic fay sorceress who lives with an entourage of amorous nymphs in magnificent palaces and lush gardens within a subterranean, paradise-like enchanted realm (inspired by Morgan's Avalon). She welcomes guests to her kingdom of carnal pleasure (\"voluttà\"), but, if, entangled in the delights, they spend more than a year there, the guests are trapped forever in sinful bliss, waiting for the Last Judgment with the fairies.\n\nIn de la Sale's \"La Salade\" (written c. 1440), a German knight and his squire enter Queen Sebile's kingdom out of curiosity and revel for a year in its forbidden pleasures. Before it is too late for him, the knight realizes the sinfulness of this by witnessing how the fair ladies transform each week into adders and scorpions for a night, so he escapes and hurries to Rome to confess to the Pope just in time. The squire, who regrets having left the pleasures of the fairy realm, flees him and returns to the Sebile's earthly paradise; the Pope sends out messengers with the news of his absolution, but they arrive too late. Sibilla is gifted with her famed prophetic powers, but tells only bad news, never good. In a similar story included within Andrea da Barberino's prose chivalric romance \"Il Guerrin Meschino\" (the part written c. 1391), a pious knight, advised to seek out the fay Sebile (\"fée Sébile\") in her abode in the mountain near Norcia, goes through a cave to her realm; he stays there for a year, but refuses all temptation and only attempts to learn about his parentage, without success. He boldly resists the flattering advances of the fay and her damsels, whose sinister nature he suspects, but later too receives an absolution after confessing to the Pope in any case.\n\nSibilla is also a recurring character in Italian works of the 16th century, such as in Gian Giorgio Trissino's \"L'Italia liberata dai Goti\" (1547). The names and characters of Sibilla, Morgan le Fay (\"Fata Morgana\") and the fairy queen Alcina are often interchangeable in Italian tales of fairies; for example, Morgan substitutes for Sibilla in P.A. Caracciolo's 15th-century \"Magico\". Pietro Aretino's 16th-century \"Ragionamenti\" mentions a certain \"sister of Sibilla of Norcia and aunt of Morgan the Fairy (Fata Morgana)\".\n\nLady Sybil appears in the stage musical \"Camelot\", played by Sue Casey in the 1967 film adaptation. In Bernard Cornwell's \"The Warlord Chronicles\" novel series, Sebile is Morgan's beautiful blond-haired Saxon slave and companion, who had lost her mind when she was gang-raped by Briton raiders after her capture until she was partially healed by Morgan. J. Robert King's novel \"Lancelot du Lethe\" includes the chapter \"The Four Queens\" retelling Malory's version of Lancelot's abduction from both Lancelot's and Morgan's perspectives. The four witch queens show up again in King's later \"Le Morte D'Avalon\", where it is revealed that they use their magic to rule their respective kingdoms through their king husbands as puppets. The scene of Lancelot's abduction also features in the adventure video game \"Lancelot\". She also appears in some other works, such as in Kate SeRine's novel \"Red\", where the villain Sebille Fenwick is a sidhe enchantress who survived to the modern times, and in J.M. Owens's \"Farewell to Avalon\", where she was one of the high priestesses of Avalon before Nimue.\n"}

She identified herself as a whistleblower and challenged her termination; however, the courts dismissed her lawsuit for wrongful termination because the FBI would need to disclose privileged information. She accused a colleague of covering up illicit activity involving Turkish nationals, alleged serious security breaches and cover-ups and that intelligence had been deliberately suppressed, endangering national security. The PEN American Center awarded her the PEN/Newman’s Own First Amendment Award in 2006 for her claims. She published a memoir in March 2012, titled \"Classified Woman – The Sibel Edmonds Story\".\n\nSibel Edmonds is the founder and publisher of the \"Boiling Frogs Post\", an online media site that aims to offer nonpartisan investigative journalism. In 2016 as editor-in-chief Sibel expanded and founded NewsBud independent news media with associates, partnered with BFP.\n\nThe daughter of an Iranian Azerbaijani father and Turkish mother, Edmonds lived in Iran and then Turkey before coming to the United States as a student in 1988. Fluent in Azerbaijani, Turkish, Persian and English, Edmonds earned her bachelor's degree in criminal justice and psychology from George Washington University and her master's in public policy and international commerce from George Mason University.\n\nEdmonds worked for the FBI for six months from late September 2001 until March 2002. Edmonds was hired, as a contractor, to work as an interpreter in the translations unit of the FBI in Washington on September 13, September 15 or September 20, 2001. Among her main roles was to translate covertly recorded conversations by Turkish diplomatic and political targets.\n\nEdmonds filed complaints about the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility and the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. In response, she claims that managers retaliated against her, and she was fired on 22 March 2002. In June 2002, the Associated Press and \"Washington Post\" reported that the FBI claimed Edmonds was dismissed because her actions were disruptive and breached security and that she performed poorly at her job. A 2005 internal investigation by the FBI Office of the Inspector General found that many of Edmonds's allegations of misconduct \"had some basis in fact\" and that \"her allegations were at least a contributing factor in the FBI’s decision to terminate her services,\" but were unable to substantiate all of her allegations, nor did they make a statement regarding her dismissal being improper.\n\nEdmonds's allegations of impropriety at the FBI later came to the attention of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held unclassified hearings on the matter on 17 June 2002, and 9 July 2002. During the hearings, the FBI provided various unclassified documents and statements relating to the case, which led to Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley sending letters, dated 19 June 2002, 13 August 2002, and 28 October 2002 – to Inspector General Glenn A. Fine, Attorney General Ashcroft, and FBI Director Robert Mueller, respectively – asking for explanations and calling for an independent audit of the FBI's translation unit. These documents were published on the Senators' web sites.\n\nIn April 2004, Edmonds claimed she had provided information to the panel investigating the September 11 attacks in February that year. Although she started work shortly after 9/11 and worked for just over six months, she claimed knowledge of information circulating within the FBI during spring and summer of 2001. The session was closed and over three hours long, she said. Reportedly, she told the commission that the FBI knew of a planned attack months away and the terrorists were in place. She stated, \"There was general information about the time-frame, about methods to be used but not specifically about how they would be used and about people being in place and who was ordering these sorts of terror attacks. There were other cities that were mentioned. Major cities with skyscrapers.\" On the 26th, a deposition of Edmonds was quashed under the state secrets privilege.\n\nOn 13 May 2004, Ashcroft submitted statements to justify the use of the state secrets privilege against the planned deposition by Edmonds, and the same day, the FBI retroactively classified as Top Secret all of the material and statements that had been provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2002 relating to Edmonds's own lawsuit, as well as the letters that had been sent by the Senators and republished by the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nOn 23 June 2004, the retroactive reclassification was challenged in a suit filed by the Project on Government Oversight, citing fear that the group might be retroactively punished for having published the letters on its website. The Justice Department tried to get the suit dismissed, and the Justice Department explicitly approved their release to the Project on Government Oversight. The reclassification did, however, keep Edmonds from testifying in the class action suit as well as her own whistleblower suit. The latter decision was appealed, and Inspector General Glenn A. Fine released a summary of the audit report, claiming \"that many of her allegations were supported, that the FBI did not take them seriously enough, and that her allegations were, in fact, the most significant factor in the FBI's decision to terminate her services. Rather than investigate Edmonds's allegations vigorously and thoroughly, the FBI concluded that she was a disruption and terminated her contract.\"\n\nIn August 2004, Edmonds founded the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (NSWBC), which exists to assist national security whistleblowers through advocacy and reform. Edmonds is also the founder and publisher of the \"Boiling Frogs Post\", an online media site that aims to offer nonpartisan investigative journalism.\n\nIn September 2005, Edmonds claimed in Vanity Fair that a price was set for Dennis Hastert to withdraw support for the Armenian Genocide resolution. That the \"... Turkish Consulate ... claimed in one recording that the price for Hastert to withdraw the resolution would have been at least $500,000.\"\n\nIn September 2006, a documentary about Edmonds's case called \"Kill the Messenger\" (\"Une Femme à Abattre\") premiered in France. The film discusses the Edmonds case and offers interviews with various involved individuals. \n\nEdmonds gave testimony in August 2009 and gave information that had twice previously been gagged under state secrets privilege.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, Edmonds published a story on her own website, adding details of events she described as taking place in April 2001. The account is of another translator's description of meetings with an Iranian informant months before 9/11, and FBI agents' reaction to it:\n\nIt was believed the agents reported this information internally at the FBI, but it is unclear that it ever went beyond that, in fact, both the agents remarked, and the translator told Edmonds, that the intelligence was not specific enough to take action upon.\n\nIn 2012, she published an autobiography called \"Classified Woman – The Sibel Edmonds Story: A Memoir\". Reviewing the book for The American Conservative, Philip Giraldi said that some details of the book could be challenged due to passage of time. However, he felt the central thesis of government incompetence and corruption was correct.\n\nSibel Edmonds, along with others, formed NewsBud, a nonpartisan journalism team supported by Kickstarter donations (setting a new fund raising records for news media, $150,000 each for the 1st & 2nd of 4 phases) by a growing community seeking alternative online news, investigative reports, analysis, original stories, video-podcasts, editorials, and discussion forums. Sibel Edmonds's primarily solo Boiling Frogs Post featuring articles and videos is being merged and absorbed into NewsBud - so BFP content is becoming NewsBud content and NewsBud content occasionally appears as a BFP heading or website.\n\n\nSibel Edmonds's sites: \nOther sites:\n"}

He became a merchant in Aalborg and later captain and vice admiral in the navy of King Christian II of Denmark. In 1523, Christian II was sent into exile and his uncle, Frederick I of Denmark had taken over the throne. In 1525, Clement mutinied and became a privateer.\n\nClement later allied himself to Christopher of Oldenburg. At Count Christoffer's instruction, he instigated the peasants of Vendsyssel and North Jutland to rise up against the nobles. On 16 October 1534 the peasant army of Clement, re-enforced with professional soldiers from Count Christoffer, met the army of the Jutland nobility, that had been sent to crush the revolt. The Battle of Svenstrup (\"Slaget ved Svenstrup\") resulted in the defeat of the nobility army. For a couple of months the revolting peasants controlled a major part of northern Jutland. They expelled the noblemen and burned down many of their manor houses. However, in the long run the peasant army was too poorly armed and too undisciplined. King Christian III of Denmark made a separate peace with Count Christoffer and his general Johan Rantzau was freed to fight the peasant revolt. \n\nIn December 1534, the army of Johan Rantzau defeated the peasant army which had retreated to Aalborg and strengthened the defenses of the city. After a hard battle, Rantzau's army overcame the defenses, sacked the city and killed as many as 2,000 people. Clement managed to escape, but was betrayed and captured by his enemies. He was kept in prison until the end of the civil war and was then executed by breaking on the wheel in Viborg, Denmark.\n\nLater historians and fiction writers have admired Clement as a revolutionary figure and a champion for the rights of the common man. Also as a local North Jutland hero he is admired and a statue was erected there in 1931. The depth of his social or ideological engagement is unprovable but as the last active, and perhaps most influential, peasant rebel in Danish history he might be viewed a Danish parallel of Wat Tyler in England, Thomas Müntzer in Germany and Yemelyan Pugachev in Russia.\n\n\n"}

Her dancing career ended abruptly when she was stricken with polio in Copenhagen during the company's European tour in 1956. Eventually regaining most of the use of her arms and torso, she remained paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of her life.\n\nLe Clercq was the daughter of Jacques Le Clercq, a French intellectual, as well as French teacher at Queens College in the 1950s and his American wife, Edith (née Whittemore); she studied ballet with Mikhail Mordkin before auditioning for the School of American Ballet in 1941, where she won a scholarship.\n\nWhen Le Clercq was fifteen years old, famed choreographer George Balanchine asked her to perform with him in a dance he choreographed for a polio charity benefit. In an eerie portent of things to come (Le Clercq would contract polio at twenty-seven and never recover mobility in her legs), he played a character named Polio, and Le Clercq was his victim who became paralyzed and fell to the floor. Then, children tossed dimes at her character, prompting her to get up and dance again.\n\nLe Clercq was considered Balanchine's first ballerina: she was trained in his style from childhood and she was one of his most important muses, together with dancers like Maria Tallchief and, later on, Suzanne Farrell. During Le Clercq's tenure with the company, Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Merce Cunningham all created roles for her. \n\nYears later, after being stricken with polio, she reemerged as a dance teacher and as one student recalled, \"used her hands and arms as legs and feet.\"\n\nLe Clercq's life and career are profiled in the 2013 documentary film, \"Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq\".\n\nTanaquil Le Clercq was the fourth and last wife (1952–1969) of George Balanchine, the pioneer of American ballet. He obtained a quick divorce from her to woo Suzanne Farrell (who refused Balanchine's wedding proposal and went on to marry another Balanchine dancer, Paul Mejia). \n\nLe Clercq died of pneumonia in New York Hospital at the age of 71.\n\n\n\n"}

She was awarded the South African Chemical Institute Gold Medal in 2012, and named one of the top 10 most influential women in science and technology in Africa by IT News Africa. She is currently researching photo-dynamic therapy, an alternative cancer treatment method to chemotherapy. In 2007, she was one of the top three publishing scientists in South Africa, and in 2013 she was awarded the National Research Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn high school, she chose arts subjects, but just two years before her matric year she changed to the sciences. She managed to overhaul the backlog of work, developing an enduring love for chemistry as she worked. She received her Cambridge Overseas School Certificate in 1972.\n\nNyokong came from a poor background. She had to wear second-hand clothes and was barefoot. As a young girl she was sent to live with her grandparents in the mountains of Lesotho. She learnt about science by observing the wildlife whilst she worked as an eight-year-old child caring for sheep. Nyokong says that she would spend one day at school and then one day with the sheep as someone had to care for them. Nyokong says that one of her childhood ambitions was to own her own pair of shoes. When she started school she was steered away from science as she was told that it was too hard. It was only with two years to go that she changed direction and with perseverance completed the science course.\n\nNyokong earned her bachelor's degree in both chemistry and biology from the University of Lesotho in 1977. She went on to earn her master's in chemistry from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. In 1987, she received her Ph.D in chemistry from the University of Western Ontario. After earning her PhD, she received a Fulbright fellowship to continue her post-doctoral studies at the University of Notre Dame in the United States.\n\nAfter finishing her Fulbright fellowship in the United States, Nyokong returned to Lesotho, briefly as it turned out, to take a position at the University of Lesotho. In 1992, she took a position as a lecturer at Rhodes University. The National Research Foundation gave her a high rating and helped Nyokong obtain a research laboratory at the university. Soon, she moved from lecturer to professor, and then distinguished professor. She is known for her research in nanotechnology, as well as her work on photo-dynamic therapy. Her pioneering research in the latter is paving the way for a safer cancer detection and treatment, without the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy.\n\nNyokong published an open letter that she wrote nominally aimed at her 18-year-old self (who would have been working hard to complete a three-year science course in just two years). The letter reassured her younger self to have courage as her family may not realise the opportunities ahead. It finishes with \"You believe you can be a wife and a mother and still be a bread winner and contribute to society. And you will.\"\n\nIn 2014 she was a professor at Rhodes University in Grahamstown. She was the subject for a photographic portrait for Adrian Steirn's \"21 icons\". which imagined her returned to her childhood role as a shepherd but now the shepherd is an adult and she is wearing her chemist's white coat.
