{"id": "41376649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41376649", "title": "Adelaide Anne Procter", "text": "Adelaide Anne Procter\n\nAdelaide Anne Procter (30 October 1825 – 2 February 1864) was an English poet and philanthropist. She worked prominently on behalf of unemployed women and the homeless, and was actively involved with feminist groups and journals. Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of tuberculosis at the age of 38.\n\nProcter's literary career began when she was a teenager; her poems were primarily published in Charles Dickens's periodicals \"Household Words\" and \"All the Year Round\" and later published in book form. Her charity work and her conversion to Roman Catholicism appear to have strongly influenced her poetry, which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness, poverty, and fallen women.\n\nProcter was the favourite poet of Queen Victoria. Her poetry went through numerous editions in the 19th century; Coventry Patmore called her the most popular poet of the day, after Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and were published in the United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how Victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings.\n\nAdelaide Anne Procter was born at 25 Bedford Square in the Bloomsbury district of London, on 30 October 1825 to the poet Bryan Waller Procter and his wife Anne (\"née\" Skepper). The family had strong literary ties: novelist Elizabeth Gaskell enjoyed her visits to the Procter household, and Procter's father was friends with poet Leigh Hunt, essayist Charles Lamb, and novelist Charles Dickens, as well as being acquainted with poet William Wordsworth and critic William Hazlitt. Family friend Bessie Rayner Belloc wrote in 1895 that \"everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow in and out of the house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the Dickens , the Thackerays, never seemed to be exactly visitors, but to belong to the place.\" Author and actress Fanny Kemble wrote that young Procter \"looks like a poet's child, and a poet ... [with] a preter-naturally thoughtful, mournful expression for such a little child\".\n\nDickens spoke highly of Procter's quick intelligence. By his account, the young Procter mastered without difficulty the subjects to which she turned her attention:\n\nWhen she was quite a young child, she learnt with facility several of the problems of Euclid. As she grew older, she acquired the French, Italian, and German languages ... piano-forte ... [and] drawing. But, as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study, it was her way to lose interest in it, and pass to another.\n\nA voracious reader, Procter was largely self-taught, though she studied at Queen's College in Harley Street in 1850. The college had been founded in 1848 by Frederick Maurice, a Christian Socialist; the faculty included novelist Charles Kingsley, composer John Hullah, and writer Henry Morley.\nProcter showed a love of poetry from an early age, carrying with her while still a young child a \"tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself could write ... as another little girl might have carried a doll\". Procter published her first poem while still a teenager; the poem, \"Ministering Angels\", appeared in \"Heath's Book of Beauty\" in 1843. In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens's \"Household Words\" under the name \"Mary Berwick\", wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens's friendship with her father; Dickens did not learn \"Berwick's\" identity till the following year. The poem's publication began Procter's long association with Dickens's periodicals; in all, Procter published 73 poems in \"Household Words\" and 7 poems in \"All the Year Round\", most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry, both entitled \"Legends and Lyrics\". She was also published in \"Good Words\" and \"Cornhill.\" As well as writing poetry, Procter was the editor of the journal \"Victoria Regia\", which became the showpiece of the Victoria Press, \"an explicitly feminist publishing venture\".\n\nIn 1851, Procter converted to Roman Catholicism. Following her conversion, Procter became extremely active in several charitable and feminist causes. She became a member of the Langham Place Group, which set out to improve conditions for women, and was friends with feminists Bessie Rayner Parkes (later Bessie Rayner Belloc) and Barbara Leigh Smith, later Barbara Bodichon. Procter helped found the \"English Woman's Journal\" in 1858 and, in 1859, the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women, both of which focused on expanding women's economic and employment opportunities. Though on paper Procter was merely one member among many, fellow-member Jessie Boucherett considered her to be the \"animating spirit\" of the Society. Her third volume of poetry, \"A Chaplet of Verses\" (1861), was published for the benefit of a Catholic Night Refuge for Women and Children that had been founded in 1860 at Providence Row in East London.\n\nProcter became engaged in 1858, according to a letter that her friend William Makepeace Thackeray wrote to his daughters that year. The identity of Procter's fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place. According to her German biographer Ferdinand Janku, the engagement seems to have lasted several years before being broken off by Procter's fiancé. Critic Gill Gregory suggests that Procter may have been a lesbian and in love with Matilda Hays, a fellow member of the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women; other critics have called Procter's relationship with Hays \"emotionally intense.\" Procter's first volume of poetry, \"Legends and Lyrics\" (1858) was dedicated to Hays and that same year Procter wrote a poem titled \"To M.M.H.\" in which Procter \"expresses love for Hays ... [Hays was a] novelist and translator of George Sand and a controversial figure ... [who] dressed in men's clothes and had lived with the sculptor Harriet Hosmer in Rome earlier in the 1850s.\" While several men showed interest in her, Procter never married.\n\nProcter fell ill in 1862; Dickens and others have suggested that her illness was due to her extensive charity work, which \"appears to have unduly taxed her strength\". An attempt to improve her health by taking a cure at Malvern failed. On 3 February 1864, Procter died of tuberculosis, having been bed-ridden for almost a year. Her death was described in the press as a \"national calamity\". Procter was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\nProcter's poetry was strongly influenced by her religious beliefs and charity work; homelessness, poverty, and fallen women are frequent themes. Procter's prefaces to her volumes of poetry stress the misery of the conditions under which the poor lived, as do poems such as \"The Homeless Poor\":\n\nIn that very street, at that same hour,\nIn the bitter air and drifting sleet,\nCrouching in a doorway was a mother,\nWith her children shuddering at her feet.\n\nShe was silent – who would hear her pleading?\nMen and beasts were housed – but she must stay\nHouseless in the great and pitiless city,\nTill the dawning of the winter day. (51–58)\n\nProcter's Catholicism also influenced her choice of images and symbols; Procter often uses references to the Virgin Mary, for example, to \"introduce secular and Protestant readers to the possibility that a heavenly order critiques Victorian gender ideology's power structure.\"\n\nProcter wrote several poems about war (the majority of poems published on this topic in \"Household Words\" were by Procter), although she rarely deals directly with the topic, preferring to leave war \"in the background, something to be inferred rather than stated.\" Generally, these poems portray conflict as something \"that might unite a nation that had been divided by class distinctions.\"\n\nAccording to critic Gill Gregory, Procter \"does not overtly ponder the vexed question of the poet, particularly the woman poet and her accession to fame\", unlike many other women poets of the time, such as Felicia Hemans and Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Procter is instead primarily concerned with the working classes, particularly working-class women, and with \"emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression\". Procter's work often embodies a Victorian aesthetic of sentimentality, but, according to Francis O'Gorman, does so with \"peculiar strength\"; Procter employs emotional affect without simplification, holding \"emotional energy [in tension] ... against complications and nuances.\" Procter's language is simple; she expressed to a friend a \"morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted\", and her poetry is marked by \"simplicity, directness, and clarity of expression\".\n\nProcter was \"fabulously popular\" in the mid-19th century; she was Queen Victoria's favourite poet and Coventry Patmore stated that the demand for her work was greater than that for any other poet, excepting Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Readers valued Procter's poems for their plainness of expression, although they were considered \"not so very original in thought; [their merit is that] they are indeed the utterances 'of a believing heart', pouring out its fulness.\" Procter herself expressed little ambition about her work: her friend Bessie Raynor Belloc thought that Procter was pained that her reputation as a poet had outstripped her father's, and quoted Procter as saying that \"Papa is a poet. I only write verses.\"\n\nProcter's popularity continued after her death; the first volume of \"Legends and Lyrics\" went through 19 editions by 1881, and the second through 14 editions by the same year. Many of her poems were made into hymns or otherwise set to music. Among these was \"The Lost Chord\", which Arthur Sullivan set to music in 1877; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States. Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German. By 1938, Procter's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them \"stupid, trivial and not worthy of the subject\". Critics such as Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a \"model middle-class domestic angel\" and a \"fragile and modest saint\" rather than as an \"active feminist and strong poet.\" Emma Mason argues that although Dickens's portrayal of Procter \"extinguished modern interest\" in her, it also \"has helped rescue Procter from the kind of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like Letitia Landon.\"\n\nModern critics have given Procter's work little attention. The few critics who have examined Procter's poetry generally find it important for the way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them. According to Isobel Armstrong, Procter's poetry, like that of many 19th-century women poets, employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety. Francis O'Gorman cites \"A Legend of Provence\" as an example of a poem with this kind of \"double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm.\" Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter's poetry, while ladylike on the surface, shows signs of repressed emotions and desires. Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful, and Gill Gregory argues that Procter's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way, while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires. Elizabeth Gray criticizes the fact that the few discussions of Procter's poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender, arguing that the \"range and formal inventiveness of this illuminatingly representative Victorian poet have remained largely unexplored.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Following in the same religious tradition as Umarov, he adhered to the ideology of Salafism. The United States Department of State added Kebekov to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists on March 25, 2015. On 19 April 2015, Kebekov was killed by Russian security forces during special operations in the settlement of Gerei-Avlak in Buynaksk. An Avar by nationality, Kebekov was the first non-Chechen to lead the North Caucasus insurgency.\n\nAliaskhab Kebekov was born on 1 January 1972 in what is now the Shamilsky District of Dagestan. He joined the Vilayat Dagestan wing of the Caucasus Emirate. In October 2010, Kebekov was appointed by Dokka Umarov as the Qadi or judge of the Caucasus Emirate, responsible for giving Shariah rulings on the groups actions. Kebekov accepted the role, despite expressing doubts about his suitability, as he was not a Mujtahid or a scholar with extensive knowledge of the Koran and Sunnah.\n\nOn 16 January 2014, an audio clip was posted on YouTube, in which a voice claiming to be Kebekov acknowledged receiving the news that Umarov had died. Kebekov seemingly rejected the proposal by other emirs of the group that he should succeed Umarov, stating that he had no military experience and had never served as a commander; instead he proposed Aslambek Vadalov for the role. Nonetheless, in March he acceded to demands and accepted the appointment. The Caucasus Emirate linked Kavkaz Center announced Kebekov's appointment, together with acknowledgment of Umarov's death. In the weeks after this announcement, the site also posted pledges of allegiance to Kebekov from groups in Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, as well as members of the Chechen-led Syria-based Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar.\n\nIn a video recording posted on the Internet in June 2014, Kebekov apologised to civilians that had been harmed by Caucasus Emirate attacks and stated that civilians should not be targeted by the group. He also called on militants not to use black widows in armed attacks or suicide bombings. The Caucasus Emirate has become more active in their insurgent activities. On 5 October 2014 a suicide bombing near the Grozny city hall took place. Five Russian police officers were killed, the suicide bomber was also killed, 12 other people were wounded. The Caucasus Emirate took credit for the attack. Byutukayev took responsibility for the 2014 Grozny clashes during which 14 Russian policemen were killed and 35 total people were wounded. The attack was one of the largest since the December 2013 Volgograd bombings, which were also carried out by the Caucasus Emirate. The day after the Grozny attack a Russian Federal Security Service building in neighboring Dagestan was reported to be engulfed in flames. If the attack was carried out by the Caucasus Emirate this would represent three large scale attacks in three months.\n\nIn late 2014 and early 2015, at least 6 field commanders of the Caucasus Emirate, and an unknown number of ordinary members, switched their allegiance from Kebekov to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. On 19 April 2015, Kebekov was killed by Russian security forces during a raid on a house in the settlement of Gerei-Avlak in Buynaksk. He was reportedly succeeded as Caucasus Emirate leader by Magomed Suleimanov.\n"}

He studied medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\nReddi's research focuses on the provision of antiretroviral therapy in resource limited settings. His research in collaboration with Sarah Leeper resulted in one of the first studies that demonstrated that pediatric antiretroviral therapy is effective despite the challenges of a resource limited setting.\n\nReddi is a featured blogger on The Huffington Post writing on global health and U.S. domestic healthcare issues. In 2010 Reddi published an opinion-editorial article that brought attention to the flat-lining of global AIDS funds by U.S. President Barack Obama's administration. Within six hours, Ezekiel Emanuel, then senior adviser to President Obama for Health Policy, responded directly to Reddi by writing in the Huffington Post: \"Contrary to what Dr. Reddi argues, neither I nor the Obama Administration sees an \"either-or\" trade-off between PEPFAR and other global health priorities such as improving maternal-child health.\" Reddi rebutted Emanuel's op-ed with a follow-up post that resulted in the restoration of $366 million for antiretroviral scale-up in Uganda.\n\nIn 2011, Reddi resigned from the Board of Directors of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation over a disagreement with AHF's opposition to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. Reddi criticized AHF's claims against PrEP in an op-ed in \"The Huffington Post\" writing: \"AHF’s media campaign against FDA review of PrEP is myopic, blinded by its determination to derail a promising new medication.\"\n\nReddi and Andreas Thyssen, while students at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, were the first to propose the use of human capital contracts to fund medical education in the United States in their article in \"The Huffington Post\" entitled: \"Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts\". The Reddi-Thyssen plan resulted in legislation by the American Medical Association in support of human capital contracts. There is also a plan to use human capital contracts in global health. Thyssen and Reddi published a manuscript in \"AIDS\" advocating the use of human capital contracts to increase the number of healthcare workers educated in resource limited settings. Human capital contracts for global health mechanism is that an investor, such as a donor nation, charitable foundation, or global health initiative, will cover the entire cost of a student's medical training. In exchange, the student will work for the first 10 years of their medical career in a government or NGO sponsored health clinic in their respective country of medical education. Their medical license will be contingent on this obligatory national service. Additionally, a multilateral “binding” agreement between the African country and destination countries (such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States)-brokered by the investor- could prevent migration during the term period.\n\n\n"}

He is the author of over 30 books, including, \"The Hope, A Guide to Sacred Activism\", \"The Direct Path\", the critically acclaimed \"Way of Passion: A Celebration of Rumi\", \"The Return of the Mother\" and \"Son of Man\". He was the subject of the 1993 BBC documentary \"The Making of a Modern Mystic\" and is the founder of the Sacred Activism movement.\n\nHarvey lives in a rural area of the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas, where he continues to write when he is not lecturing. Harvey conducts workshops on Sacred Activism, the teachings of Rumi, yoga and practices that will lead to deeper spiritual awareness. Harvey travels with students to sacred sites in India, Australia and South Africa, and offers personal spiritual direction. Harvey was listed as number 33 in the Watkins' Mind Body Spirit magazine as one of the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People in 2012. In 2012, he was nominated for the Templeton Prize, which was eventually awarded to the Dalai Lama.\n\nHarvey was born in Coimbatore, India in 1952 and lived there until he was nine years old. He was educated at English boarding schools and then Oxford University, where he later taught Shakespeare and French literature until 1977. He wrote his dissertation on madness in Shakespeare and Erasmus.\n\nAt 21 in the early 1970s, Harvey became a fellow of All Souls College, University of Oxford. By 1977 he had become disillusioned with life at Oxford and returned to his native India, where a series of mystical experiences initiated his spiritual journey. Over the next thirty years he plunged into different mystical traditions to learn their secrets and practices. In 1978 he met a succession of Indian saints and sages and began his study and practice of Hinduism. In 1983, in Ladakh, he met a Tibetan adept, Thuksey Rinpoche, and undertook with him the Mahayana Buddhist bodhisattva vows; later, in 1990, he would collaborate with Sogyal Rinpoche and Patrick Gaffney in the writing of \"The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying\". In 1984, Harvey began a ten-year-long exploration and explication of Rumi and Sufi mysticism in Paris with a group of French Sufis under the guidance of Eva de Vitray-Meyerovitch, the translator of Rumi into French. In 1992, he met Father Bede Griffiths in his ashram in south India near where Harvey had been born. It was this meeting that helped him synthesize the whole of his mystical explorations and reconcile Eastern with Western mysticism. \nWhile in India, Harvey encountered Mother Meera, who became his guru and the subject of his book \"Hidden Journey\". His memoir, \"The Sun at Midnight\", describes their subsequent break and his disillusionment with gurus.\n\nFor the last 30 years, Harvey has travelled widely, living in India, London, Paris, New York and San Francisco, studying, teaching at university level and in seminars and workshops. A prolific writer, Harvey has authored or co-authored over 30 books. His focus since 2005 has been the advocacy of what he terms \"Sacred Activism\". He is the founder and director of the Institute of Sacred Activism, which trains leaders and social justice advocates.\n\nHarvey is a scholar of mystic traditions. He envisions true spirituality to be the divinisation of earthly life through spiritual practice. These practices can take many forms and can be taken from religious traditions.\nHarvey sees six poets and religious figures as having universal appeal:\n\nHarvey also emphasises the Divine Feminine, as expressed in the Virgin Mary, Kali, the Black Madonna and Mother Earth.\n\nSince 2005, Andrew Harvey's work has focused on teaching Sacred Activism around the globe. Harvey describes sacred activism as \"the product of the union of a profound spiritual and mystical knowledge, understanding, and compassion, peace and energy, with focused, wise, radical action in the world.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He was re-elected in the 2015 parliamentary election.\n\nMartí was born in Escaldes-Engordany and studied at the (Toulouse National School of Architecture), part of the Université fédérale de Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées. He is an architect by profession.\n\nMartí was first elected to the General Council in 1993, the first parliamentary election to involve political parties, as a member of the Liberal Union. In the election, the Liberal Union came a close second. Òscar Ribas Reig, who had been appointed Prime Minister, lost a vote of no confidence in 1994, leading to Marc Forné Molné, the leader of the Liberal Union, being appointed as Prime Minister. Martí was re-elected in the 1997 election, in which the Liberal Union won and Molné remained as Prime Minister. Shortly before the 2001 election, the Liberal Union was renamed as the Liberal Party of Andorra, and went on to win the election, with Molné retaining his role as Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2004, Martí resigned from the General Council and was elected as Mayor of Escaldes-Engordany, the second largest town in Andorra. He served two consecutive terms as Mayor, from 2004 to 2007, and from 2008 to 2011. The Liberal Party had contested the 2009 election as part of the Reformist Coalition, losing to the Social Democratic Party led by Jaume Bartumeu. Bartumeu opted to call an early election in 2011 after losing the budget vote two years running to the opposition parties. In February 2011, the Democrats for Andorra was formed as a direct successor to the Reformist Coalition, with Martí as their candidate for Prime Minister. He campaigned against Bartumeu's proposed introduction of an income tax. The Democrats for Andorra won 55.5% of the vote, and Bartumeu resigned as Prime Minister on 28 April 2011, to be replaced by Pere López Agràs in an interim capacity until 12 May 2011, when Martí was appointed.\n\nIn 2011, Martí opened negotiations with the European Union over various aspects of cooperation. During the negotiations, Andorra changed the foreign investment law, opening the country up to foreign investors, and also signed an agreement with France and Spain to avoid double taxation. Martí has also overseen the introduction of the euro as the official currency of Andorra, following an agreement which was completed in June 2011. Andorra was permitted to issue their own euros from July 2013, but due to various delays, Andorran euros did not enter circulation until January 2015. In late May 2013, Martí met with François Hollande, the President of France and a Co-Prince of Andorra, to inform him of his intentions to bring in a law to introduce personal income tax in Andorra. Hollande encouraged Martí to continue with economic reforms that may lead to growth. In June 2013, Martí bowed to pressure from the European Union and did introduce a personal income tax for Andorrans.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Martí oversaw the response to the 2015 Andorran banking crisis, involving American allegations of money laundering made against the Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA). The government responded to this by the restructuring of the bank, and the creation and sale of Vall Banc in place of BPA. In June 2016, Martí praised Michel Camdessus's 2005 report about Andorra, that \"turned out to be prophetic.\" In turn, Camdessus expressed his respect \"the government of Andorra for the fact that the Principality embarked on the path of reforms, turning from protectionism and stagnation in the direction of openness and competitiveness.\"\n\n"}

The word 'Bodo' has been derived from the word 'Bod' which means Tibet. The Bodos speak the Bodo language.\n\nThey are recognized as a plains tribe in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. Udalguri, Chirang, Baksa, Sonitpur, Goalpara, Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Kokrajhar of Assam are considered the centre of the Bodo People. The Bodos living in West Bengal are called Mech. The Bodos use the term \"Bodo's\" (which is pronounced as Borosa meaning son of Bodo's) to describe themselves.\n\nThe Boro language is one of the languages of the Sino-Tibetan or Tibeto-Chinese speech family. It belongs to the Boro, Naga group of the Assam-Burmese branch of the Sino Tibetan family.\n\nBodos traditionally practise Bathouism, which is the worshiping of forefathers, known as Obonglaoree. The shijou plant (Euphorbia genus) is taken as the symbol of Bathou and worshiped. It is also claimed as the supreme god. In Bodo language, Ba means five and thou means deep. As Bodos believe in five mighty elements of God, which are Land, Water, Air, Fire and Sky, five has become a significant number in the Bathou religion.\n\nThe Shijou tree is encircled with eighteen pairs of designed bamboo sticks and five pairs of ring of bamboo. In front of Shijou within encircled bamboo ring there is a 'Dove Heart'.\n\nAccording to the concept of Bathouism, before the creation of universe, there was simply a great void, in which the supreme being 'Aham Guru', Anan Binan Gosai or Obonglaoree existed formlessly. The supreme god Aham guru became tired of living formless existence and desired to live in flesh and blood. He descended on this great void with all human characteristics. Thereafter he created the universe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18845725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18845725", "title": "Colorado House career of Douglas Bruce", "text": "Colorado House career of Douglas Bruce\n\nThe Colorado House of Representatives career of Douglas Bruce began with Bruce's appointment to a vacant legislative seat in November 2007 and his swearing-in in January 2008; he was a focal point of controversy during his one term in the state house, becoming the first legislator in Colorado history to be officially censured. He was defeated in the Republican primary in his 2008 bid for a full term.\n\nIn October 2007, Bruce announced his plans to seek a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives. After Rep. Bill Cadman was appointed to fill a Senate seat vacated by Ron May, Bruce sought to be appointed to Cadman's seat representing House District 15. Bruce faced two other Republican challengers for the appointment during a short but contentious battle for the vacancy committee nomination, during which he questioned the professional credentials of one of his opponents, and opponents charged that he was too divisive a figure to successfully represent the district. Ultimately, Bruce received two-thirds of the votes from the 66 members of the vacancy committee, beating out former school board candidate and engineer Reginald Perry and businessman Steve Hasbrouck.\n\nBruce postponed being sworn in until January 14, 2008—several days after the start of the legislative session—in order to be eligible to serve a full four terms beyond the partial term under Colorado's term limits rules. The move was criticized by former Republican Senator Ron May and Democratic House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, who, in response to Bruce's actions, called for legislation requiring that newly appointed legislators be sworn in within a specific period of time. Such a bill, which would require appointed legislators to be sworn in within 14 days of their selection, was introduced later in the session by Democratic Reps. Paul Weissmann and Dorothy Butcher; Bruce took the unusual step for a legislator of testifying against the bill at a committee hearing, but the bill passed the state house, with Bruce casting the only dissenting vote.\n\nBruce clashed with legislative leaders over the time of his swearing-in, demanding to be sworn in at 10 a.m. in front of the full house. Both Speaker Romanoff and Republican leader Mike May requested that Bruce take the oath at a different time, as is customary for vacancy appointments, in order not to interfere with House business. Bruce was present at the 10 a.m. start of legislative business on January 14, but he was not officially recognized by Speaker Romanoff during the morning session. After House Republicans voted 22-1 to call for a representative to be named for District 15 if Bruce did not take the oath of office by the end of the day, Bruce was sworn in by Romanoff at 1:30 p.m.\n\nAlready fined for an unexcused absence from the commission meeting on Monday morning, Bruce submitted his resignation as an El Paso County Commissioner after being sworn in as a state representative, effective January 15. After his resignation, Bruce sent a letter to the vacancy committee members who would choose his replacement criticizing Amy Lathen, the leading candidate for his commission seat, as unqualified and inconsistent on tax issues, calling her a \"Republican in Name Only;\" the letter was denounced by El Paso County Republican Party officials. Lathen, who had planned for months to run a primary campaign for the commission seat against Bruce, was elected by the vacancy committee with a majority of votes on the first ballot.\n\nOn the morning before he was sworn in, Bruce was present on the house floor during the session's morning prayer. Javier Manzano, a \"Rocky Mountain News\" photographer, took Bruce's picture during the prayer; Bruce kicked him in the knee, telling Manzano, \"Do not do that again.\" Bruce later accused the photographer of \"violating the order and decorum\" of the house and refused to apologize. Republican Minority Leader Mike May issued a formal apology to the photographer, and state Republican chairman Dick Wadhams \"strongly denounce[d]\" Bruce's actions.\n\nSpeaker Romanoff and Minority Leader May convened a bipartisan six-member panel to investigate and made recommendations concerning the incident; on Friday, January 18, the panel recommended 6-0 that Bruce be censured by the House for his actions, and 5-1 that a formal apology be requested from Bruce. Although Manzano testified before the panel, he declined to press criminal charges against Bruce.\n\nRomanoff elected to pursue the censure recommendation, and, on January 24, the full House of Representatives voted 62-1 (with only Rep. Kevin Lundberg opposed) to censure Bruce. He became the first representative in the recorded history of the state house to be formally censured.\n\nFor the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Bruce was named to seats on the House Finance Committee and the House State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee. At the start of the 2008 General Assembly session, before being sworn in, Bruce announced his opposition to a large portion of the House Republican caucus legislative agenda, including a sales tax holiday for school supplies, a pine beetle mitigation fund, new specialty license plates, and targeted tax credits, noting in a letter to Republican whip Cory Gardner: \"I thought the GOP was the party of less government and more freedom, of protecting individualism, not streamlining socialism.\"\n\nThe first bill introduced by Bruce during the 2008 session was a measure to require the Colorado Department of Education to distribute copies of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution to high school seniors, to mandate classroom instruction on the documents, and to offer a brief constitutional law course to members of the Colorado General Assembly. The bill died after facing unanimous opposition from the House Education Committee.\n\nAnother of Bruce's bills, which would have prohibited counties from assessing any charges other than property taxes, including fines for delinquent payments or stormwater fees, on property tax bills, was also killed in committee. Bruce also advanced a measure which would have eliminated \"per diem\" expense payments for legislators and indexed legislators' pay to inflation, as well as requiring voter approval for any pay increases above this amount. All four bills introduced by Bruce were killed in committee. Late in the legislative session, Bruce introduced a bill to create a seven-member bipartisan panel, including three unaffiliated voters, to draw up Colorado's congressional and legislative districts following the 2010 census and reapportionment.\n\nBruce has also objected to the practice of attaching a \"safety clause\" to bills, a provision which uses a declaration that the bill is \"necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety\" to change the date of enactment and prohibit challenges to the legislation via the petition process. He has pledged to vote against all legislation containing an unjustified safety clause, and has offered amendments to a number of bills to remove the safety clause. Bruce's amendments often failed on account of legislators' personal hostility towards him; on at least one occasion, after the house voted down his proposal to strike the safety clause, the motion passed after being introduced by another legislator. House members eventually developed the practice of supporting the removal of the safety clause if the legislator sponsoring the bill agreed; in 2008, 41% of bill passed had no safety clause, up from 25% the previous year.\n\nBruce also proposed several changes to House operations and procedure, including use of tasers by state capitol security—a proposal received favorably by legislative leaders—and increased office space for legislators—an idea not well received.\n\nBruce was a vocal critic of the proposed state budget debated during the 2008 legislative session, characterizing the budget's $3,500 in expenditures per Colorado resident as \"fiscal child abuse.\" During budget debates, Bruce offered unsuccessful amendments to eliminate 524 new employees at colleges and universities, to cut a federally funded program for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and to prevent the transfer of 165 contract corrections employees to state payrolls.\n\nBruce also joined with left-leaning and environmental groups in opposing proposed changes to Colorado's petition process that would raise signature requirements and make it more difficult to put proposals to amend the Colorado state constitution on the statewide ballot.\n\nBruce also entered into debate on, and voted against, a bill to impose new requirements on landlords and set standards for rental properties. His actions generated criticism from other legislators, who argued that Bruce should have recused himself from voting on the measure because his ownership of rental properties created a conflict of interest; two other legislators recused themselves for similar reasons.\n\nOn February 13, Bruce, alone among 100 state legislators, refused to sign on as a cosponsor to an annual joint resolution recognizing Military and Veterans Appreciation Day. Bruce had protested other resolutions in the legislature as a waste of time, similar to his practice of refusing to vote on resolutions as an El Paso County commissioner. Later in the session, Bruce proposed a change to House rules to allow members to abstain from voting on resolutions.\n\nIn response to public complaints, Republican Minority Leader Mike May removed Bruce from the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, which oversees veterans' issues. Bruce dismissed the move as \"political posturing.\" Other Republican legislators denounced Bruce in a public letter for \"callous indifference\" towards veterans. Bruce offered as evidence of his support for veterans his successful amendment to a house bill to include interest in a state repayment to the Colorado Veterans Trust Fund, a move which resulted in an additional $636,000 repaid to the fund. Bruce would later cite this as one of his major accomplishments during the 2008 session.\n\nThe following week, Bruce signed on as a cosponsor to an annual resolution calling for civility between members of the legislature; he said that it did not violate his standard of refusing to support symbolic resolutions because he considered the measure to be a \"pledge of personal behavior.\"\n\nAs a legislator, Bruce was entitled to apply for \"per diem\" compensation for living expenses during the legislative session. After having delayed his swearing into the state house for five days after the start of the session, Bruce applied for and received compensation for those days amounting to $750 more than what he was legally entitled to. Colorado legislative council staff later accepted responsibility for what was referred to as a \"clerical error\" and has pledged to return the excess funds.\nBruce has pledged to donate his legislative salary and \"per diem\" payments to the non-profit charity \"Active Citizens Together,\" a group founded by Bruce to educate citizens on personal and property rights and advocate for limited government.\n\nOn April 21, 2008, Bruce voiced opposition during house debate on a bill sponsored by Rep. Marsha Looper to create a guest worker program to facilitate temporary employment visas for agricultural workers from Mexico. After speaking against illegal immigration and being advised to restrict comments to the bill by debate chair Rep. Kathleen Curry, Bruce took the floor a second time and commented:\nBruce was immediately gavelled to order by Rep. Curry, who ruled that he would no longer be recognized during debate on the bill. Bruce's comments were denounced by Assistant Majority Leader Terrance Carroll as violating the \"decorum of the house;\" they were also criticized by Minority Leader Mike May, the Mexican consulate in Denver. and the Anti-Defamation League. The following day, the Latino Faith-Based Initiative, and the Democratic Party Latino Initiative both called for Bruce's resignation from the legislature.\n\nBruce defended his remarks as being factually accurate, citing dictionary definitions of \"illiterate\" and \"peasant\". Legislators briefly considered bringing a formal ethics complaint against him, but ultimately chose not to. Legislators responded to Bruce's propensity for generating controversy by declaring that they would \"start ignoring him\". Rep. Curry requested additional law enforcement protection after receiving an influx of threatening messages from opponents of illegal immigration. Bruce, however, received hundreds of largely positive email messages in response to news coverage of the controversy. The following weekend, Bruce's comments were the target of a local protest in Colorado Springs attended by about 50.\n\nSeveral days later, Bruce submitted an amendment — facetiously drafted by the \"linguistic sensitivity codification commission\" — to another bill addressing immigration issues to substitute \"undocumented, temporary guest resident\" in place of \"illegal aliens\" in statutory language. The amendment was offered and defeated twice.\n\nOn April 30, Bruce was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint after a female legislative staffer alleged that he made inappropriate verbal comments towards her. After being formally confronted by House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, Bruce was instructed to stay away from the woman who filed the complaint, according to reports by other representatives. Legislative leaders refused to publicly discuss the complaint, but Douglas Bruce stated in a radio interview that the incident in question involved only looking and smiling at a woman.\n\nAfter both Bruce and the woman involved were interviewed by attorneys, Bruce reported in July that the harassment complaint had been dismissed for lack of evidence, and suggested that the timing of the investigation's conclusion was politically motivated, coming just weeks before a contested primary race.\n\nBruce announced in November 2007 that he would stand in the 2008 general election for the House District 15 seat. He faces a challenge for the Republican nomination from attorney and Iraq War veteran Mark Waller. Following the precedent of his county commission campaign four years earlier, Bruce funded his own campaign, refusing to accept private campaign donations; instead, Bruce donated over $30,000 of his own money to his campaign. He did, however, unsuccessfully solicit donations for his charity, Active Citizens Together, from other lawmakers. Reflecting Bruce's status as a \"pariah\" among some Colorado Springs Republicans, Waller received endorsements or contributions during his campaign from at least five sitting state representatives, including Bob Gardner, Larry Liston, and Marsha Looper, as well as former Sen. Ron May and Colorado Attorney General John Suthers.\n\nWaller outpolled Bruce by receiving 57% of the vote at the Republican assembly in March, claiming the top line on the August Republican primary ballot; he was supported by some delegates who had voted for Bruce's legislative appointment months earlier. During his campaign, Waller did not draw a contrast on political positions with Bruce, but argued that Bruce's temperament caused him to be an ineffective legislator.\n\nBruce faced criticism from House Democratic and Republican leaders in April for distributing campaign fliers critical of Waller to Republican representatives on the House floor. Although not a violation of the law or House rules, legislative leaders denounced the action as a breach of decorum and tradition. Waller also called for Bruce's resignation in April 2008, after Bruce's controversial comments about Mexican guest workers. Bruce, in response, characterised Waller as a \"conformer\" rather than a \"reformer,\" and stated that his controversial actions were designed to draw attention to inappropriate legislative actions.\n\nShortly before the August primary, Bruce was again criticized by Waller for mailing flyers promoting his charity, Active Citizens Together, soliciting volunteers and donations for the charity and stating: \"to reform government, ACT with Douglas Bruce.\" Although Waller declared that the flyers were \"an obvious attempt at campaigning,\" he did not file a complaint with the Colorado Secretary of State's office, as he believed no laws were actually broken; the flyers did not mention any of Bruce's elected positions. Bruce was also criticized for listing endorsements on his website from political officials who had endorsed his campaign for county commissioner, but not specifically endorsed his legislative campaign. After attention was called to the discrepancy, Bruce had the erroneous endorsements removed, citing an \"overzealous webmaster.\"\n\nIn turn, Bruce filed several campaign finance complaints against Waller, all but one of which—an accusation that Waller improperly accepted a corporate donation—were dismissed. The hearing on Bruce's complaint was postponed until after the primary, over Bruce's objection, but resulted in Waller being cited and fined for failing to disclose a campaign contribution. Bruce also criticized Waller for his failure to vote in several recent elections, including the 2004 general election.\n\nBruce was narrowly defeated for the Republican nomination in the August 12 party primary, taking only 48 percent of the vote to Waller's 52 percent.\n\nDemocrat Allison Hunter withdrew from the race in December 2007, arguing that Bruce's appointment by a vacancy committee gave him \"too great an advantage\" in general election; Waller will face Democrat Michelle Maksimowicz in November 2008.\n"}

He belonged to the country's majority Fang ethnic group.\n\nAs a boy of 9, Nguema saw his father punched to death by a Spanish colonial administrator when he tried to use his title of chief to negotiate for better wages for his people. Nguema was orphaned a week later when his mother committed suicide, leaving the boy and 10 siblings to fend for themselves.\n\nMacías Nguema failed the civil service exam three times. However, he eventually rose to the position of mayor of Mongomo under the Spanish colonial government, and later served as a member of the territorial parliament. In 1964, he was named deputy prime minister of the autonomous transition government. He ran for president of the soon-to-be independent country against Prime Minister Bonifacio Ondó Edu on a strongly nationalist platform in 1968. In what has been the only free election held in the country to date, he defeated Ondó Edu in the runoff and was sworn in as president on 12 October. Ondó Edu briefly went into exile in Gabon, and was officially reported to have committed suicide on 5 March 1969, although Edu has been reported to have actually been executed soon after his return on trumped-up charges of having had been planning a coup.\n\nOn 7 May 1971, Macías Nguema issued Decree 415, which repealed parts of the 1968 Constitution and granted him \"all direct powers of Government and Institutions\", including powers formerly held by the legislative and judiciary branches, as well as the cabinet of ministers. On 18 October 1971, Law 1 imposed the death penalty as punishment for threatening the President or the government. Insulting or offending the President or his cabinet was punishable by 30 years in prison. On 14 July 1972, a presidential decree merged all existing political parties into the United National Party (later the United National Workers' Party), with Macías Nguema as President for Life of both nation and party.\n\nIn a plebiscite held on 29 July 1973, the 1968 Constitution was replaced with a new document that gave Macías Nguema absolute power and formally made his party the only one legally permitted in the country. According to official figures, an implausible 99 percent of voters approved the new document. Three months later, a fresh \"presidential election\" confirmed Macías Nguema as president for life.\n\nMacías Nguema declared private education subversive, and banned it entirely with Decree 6 on 18 March 1975.\n\nDuring his presidency, his country was nicknamed \"the Dachau of Africa\". He was known to order entire families and villages executed.\n\nThree important pillars of his rule were the United National Workers' Party, the Juventud en Marcha con Macías militia/youth group, and the Esangui clan of Río Muni. The country's instruments of repression (military, presidential bodyguard) were entirely controlled by Macías Nguema's relatives and clan members. The president's paranoid actions included mandating the death of those who wore spectacles, banning use of the word \"intellectual\" and destroying boats to stop his people fleeing from his rule (fishing was banned). The only road out of the country on the mainland was also mined. He Africanised his name to Masie Nguema Biyogo Ñegue Ndong in 1976 after demanding that the rest of the Equatoguinean population replace their Hispanic names with African names. He also banned Western medicines, stating that they were un-African.\n\nMacías Nguema was the centre of an extreme cult of personality, perhaps fueled by his consumption of copious amounts of \"bhang\" and \"iboga\", and assigned himself titles such as the \"Unique Miracle\" and \"Grand Master of Education, Science, and Culture\". The island of Fernando Pó had its name Africanised after him to Masie Ngueme Biyogo Island; upon his overthrow in 1979, its name was again changed to Bioko. The capital, Santa Isabel, had its name changed to Malabo. In 1978, he changed the national motto to \"There is no other God than Macías Nguema\".\n\nDuring Macías Nguema's government, the country had neither a development plan nor an accounting system for government funds. After the killing of the governor of the Central Bank, he carried everything that remained in the national treasury to his house in a rural village. On Christmas Eve of 1969 about 150 of his opponents were killed. Soldiers executed them by shooting at the football stadium in Malabo, while amplifiers were playing Mary Hopkin's song \"Those Were the Days.\"\n\nMacías Nguema's government forced tens of thousands of citizens to flee in fear of persecution and to protect their personal safety. Intellectuals and skilled professionals were a particular target, due to which human rights researcher Robert af Klinteberg, in a 1978 study that examined the government's repression in detail, called it a policy of \"deliberate cultural regression.\" Af Klinteberg reported that as of 1978, at least 101,000 persons, out of a contemporary population that the World Bank estimates totalled 215,284 persons—nearly 47% of the population—had fled the country. Other reporting, such as a 1979 Time magazine account stating that \"perhaps 150,000\" persons fled, suggests that the proportion of the population that sought safety in exile may have approached 70%, based on the World Bank's estimate of the population in 1979. \n\nBy the end of his rule, nearly all of the country's educated class was either executed or forced into exile—a brain drain from which the country has never recovered. Two-thirds of the legislature and 10 of his original ministers were also killed. \n\nSome observers have posited that Macías Nguema may have been a psychopath, a disorder potentially enabled, in part, by reported childhood psychological trauma, and that his behaviour could have been affected by other possible mental illnesses, as well as his reported periodic use of the psychoactive plant Iboga and large quantities of cannabis.\n\nBy 1979, Macías Nguema's government had garnered condemnations from the United Nations and European Commission. That summer, Macías Nguema organised the execution of several members of his own family, leading several members of his inner circle to fear that he was no longer acting rationally. On 3 August 1979 he was overthrown by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who was Macías Nguema's nephew (and the brother of one of the victims) and who served previously as the military governor of Bioko and Vice-Minister of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe deposed ruler and a contingent of loyal forces initially resisted the coup, but his forces eventually abandoned him, and he was captured in a forest on 18 August. Prior to his overthrow, he sent his three minor children (Monica, Maribel, and Paco) to North Korea for safety. They lived there for the remainder of their childhood and now live in various other countries.\n\nThe Supreme Military Council opened Case 1/979 on 18 August 1979, and began interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence against the Macías Nguema government. The Council subsequently convened a military tribunal on 24 September to try Macías Nguema and several members of his government. The charges for the ten defendants included genocide, mass murder, embezzlement of public funds, violations of human rights, and treason.\n\nThe state prosecutor requested that Macías Nguema receive the death penalty, five others receive thirty years in prison, and four others receive a year in prison. Macías Nguema's defence counsel countered that the other co-defendants were responsible for specific crimes, and asked for acquittal. Macías Nguema himself delivered a statement to the court outlining what he viewed as the extensive good deeds he had performed for the country. At noon on 29 September 1979, the Tribunal delivered its sentences, which were more severe than what the prosecution had requested. Macías Nguema and six of his co-defendants were sentenced to death and the confiscation of their property; Nguema being sentenced to death '101 times'. Two defendants were sentenced to fourteen years in prison each, and two others to four years each.\n\nWith no higher court available to hear appeals, the decision of the Special Military Tribunal was final. Macías Nguema and the six other defendants sentenced to death were executed by a hired Moroccan Army firing squad at Black Beach Prison at 6 pm on the same day. During his execution, he was reportedly \"calm and dignified\".\n\nDepending on the source, during his government, anywhere from 50,000 to 80,000 of the 300,000 to 400,000 people living in the country at the time were killed. According to Pennsylvania State University professor Randall Fegley, this was proportionally worse than the Nazis' rampage through Europe. He has been compared to Pol Pot because of the violent, unpredictable, and anti-intellectual nature of his government.\n"}

Soon after its establishment, the bureau's deputy manager Voitinsky arrived in Beijing and contacted the Communist vanguard Li Dazhao. Li arranged for Voitinsky to meet with another Communist leader, Chen Duxiu, in Shanghai. In August 1920, Voitinsky, Chen Duxiu, Li Hanjun, Shen Xuanlu, Yu Xiusong, Shi Cuntong, and others began to establish the Comintern China Branch.\n\nThe \"Shanghai Chronicle\" was set up in 1919 in Shanghai by Shemeshko and other Russians with socialist leanings, and received financial aid from the Soviet Russian government in early 1920. In the spring of 1920, Voitinsky and his colleagues came to China on a mission to establish the Communist Party in China. They not only came to China in the guise of editors and reporters for the newspaper, but also set up the Comintern's East Asia Secretariat in the newspaper office. From then on, the \"Shanghai Chronicle\" became both a propaganda vehicle for the East Asia Secretariat and a cover for Bolshevik activity in China. Because the newspaper staff assisted Soviet Russian and Comintern personnel stationed under cover at the newspaper in activities to establish a communist organization in China, the newspaper as a whole played a special role in the early communist movement in China. Although the \"Shanghai Chronicle\" stopped publication at the end of 1922 because Russian aid came to an end, many staff members continued to work for Bolshevism.\n\nHe worked as Comintern representative until 1926. Then worked in the Siberian government in Irkutsk until 1929, when he moved to Moscow, where he worked in various orientalist institutions. In 1934 he became a professor in Moscow State University.\n\nHe is considered one of the founders of Soviet Sinology. He wrote several books about contemporary China politics. He died in 1953 during an unsuccessful surgical operation.\n"}

{"id": "293847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293847", "title": "Huineng", "text": "Huineng\n\nDajian Huineng (; 638–713), also commonly known as the Sixth Patriarch or Sixth Ancestor of Chan, is a semi-legendary but central figure in the early history of Chinese Chan Buddhism. He was said to have been an uneducated layman who suddenly attained awakening upon hearing the Diamond Sutra. Despite his lack of formal training, he demonstrated his understanding to the fifth patriarch, Daman Hongren, who then supposedly chose Huineng as his true successor instead of his publicly known selection of Yuquan Shenxiu. Twentieth century scholarship revealed that the story of Huineng's Buddhist career was likely invented by the monk Heze Shenhui, who claimed to be one of Huineng's disciples and was highly critical of Shenxiu's teaching. Huineng is regarded as the founder of the \"Sudden Enlightenment\" Southern Chan school of Buddhism, which focuses on an immediate and direct attainment of Buddhist enlightenment. The \"Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch\" (), which is said to be a record of his teachings, is a highly influential text in the East Asian Buddhist tradition.\n\nMost modern scholars doubt the historicity of traditional biographies and works written about Huineng. The two primary sources for Huineng's life are the preface to the \"Platform Sutra\" and the \"Transmission of the Lamp\".\nAccording to Huineng's autobiography in the Platform Sutra, Huineng's father was from Fanyang, but he was banished from his government position and passed away at a young age. Huineng and his mother were left in poverty and moved to Nanhai, where Huineng sold firewood to support his family. One day, Huineng delivered firewood to a customer's shop, where he met a man reciting the Diamond Sutra. He inquired about the reason that the Diamond Sutra was chanted, and the person stated that he came from the Eastern Meditation Monastery in Huangmei District of the province of Qi, where the Fifth Patriarch of Chan lived and delivered his teachings. Huineng's customer paid his ten silver taels and suggested that he meet the Fifth Patriarch of Chan.\n\nHuineng reached Huangmei thirty days later, and expressed to the Fifth Patriarch his specific request of attaining Buddhahood. Since Huineng came from Guangdong and was physically distinctive from the northern people from China, the Fifth Patriarch Hongren questioned his origin as a “barbarian from the south”, and doubted his ability to attain enlightenment. Huineng impressed Hongren with a clear understanding of the ubiquitous Buddha nature in everyone, and convinced Hongren to let him stay. He was told to split firewood and pound rice in the backyard of the monastery and avoid going to the main hall.\n\nThe Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch is attributed to a disciple of Huineng named Fahai (法海) and purports to be a record of Huineng's life, lectures and interactions with disciples. However, the text shows signs of having been constructed over a longer period of time, and contains different layers of writing. It is...\n\nThe Platform Sūtra cites and explains a wide range of Buddhist scriptures listed here in the order of appearance:\n\n\nEight months later, the Fifth Patriarch summoned all his followers and proposed a poem contest for his followers to demonstrate the stage of their understanding of the essence of mind. He decided to pass down his robe and teachings to the winner of the contest, who would become the Sixth Patriarch. Shenxiu, the leading disciple of the Fifth Patriarch, composed a stanza but did not have the courage to present it to the master. Instead, he wrote his stanza on the south corridor wall to remain anonymous one day at midnight. The other monks saw the stanza and commended it. Shenxiu's stanza is as follows:<br><br>\n\n\"The body is the tree of enlightenment, 身是菩提樹，\"\n\n\"The mind is like a bright mirror’s stand; 心如明鏡臺。\"\n\n\"Time after time polish it diligently, 時時勤拂拭，\"\n\n\"So that no dust can collect.\" \"勿使惹塵埃。\"<br><br>\n\nThe Patriarch was not satisfied with Shenxiu's stanza, and pointed out that the poem did not show understanding of “[his] own fundamental nature and essence of mind”. He gave Shenxiu a chance to submit another poem to demonstrate that he had entered the “gate of enlightenment”, so that he could transmit his robe and the Dharma to Shenxiu, but the student's mind was agitated and could not write one more stanza.\n\nTwo days later, the illiterate Huineng heard Shenxiu's stanza being chanted by a young attendant at the monastery and inquired about the context of the poem. The attendant explained to him the poem contest and the transmission of the robe and Dharma. Huineng asked to be led to the corridor, where he could also pay homage to the stanza. He asked a low-ranking official named Zhang Riyong from Jiangzhou to read the verse to him, and then immediately asked him to write down a stanza that he composed. Huineng's stanza was the following:<br>\n\n<br>\n\"Enlightenment is not a tree, 菩提本無樹，\"\n\n\"The bright mirror has no stand; 明鏡亦非臺。\"\n\n\"Originally there is not one thing— 本來無一物，\"\n\n\"What place could there be for dust?\" 何處惹塵埃。<br><br>\n\nThe followers who were present were astonished by the work of a southern barbarian. Being cautious of Huineng's status, the Patriarch wiped away the stanza and claimed that the author of the stanza had not reached enlightenment.\nHowever, on the next day, the Patriarch secretly went to Huineng's room and asked, “Should not a seeker after the Dharma risk his life this way?” Then he asked, “is the rice ready?” Huineng responded that the rice was ready and only waiting to be sieved. The Patriarch secretly explained the Diamond Sutra to Huineng, and when Huineng heard the phrase “one should activate one’s mind so it has no attachment”, he was “suddenly and completely enlightened, and understood that all things exist in self-nature.” \n\nThe Dharma was passed to Huineng at night, when the Patriarch transmitted “the doctrine of sudden enlightenment” as well as his robe and bowl to Huineng. He told Huineng, “You are now the Sixth Patriarch. Take care of yourself, save as many sentient beings as you can, and spread the teachings so they will not be lost in the future. \n\nHe also explained to Huineng that the Dharma was transmitted from mind to mind, whereas the robe was passed down physically from one patriarch to the next. Hongren instructed the Sixth Patriarch to leave the monastery before he could be harmed. “You can stop at Huai and then hide yourself at Hui.” Hongren showed Huineng the route to leave the monastery, and rowed Huineng across the river to assist his escape. Huineng immediately responded with a clear understanding of Hongren's purpose in doing so, and demonstrated that he could ferry to “the other shore” with the Dharma that had been transmitted to him. \n\nThe Sixth Patriarch reached the Tayu Mountains within two months, and realized that hundreds of men were following him, attempting to rob him of the robe and bowl. However, the robe and bowl could not be moved by Huiming, who then asked for the transmission of Dharma from Huineng. Huineng helped him reach enlightenment and continued on his journey. \nAccording to the traditional interpretation, which is based on Guifeng Zongmi, the fifth-generation successor of Shenhui, the two verses represent respectively the gradual and the sudden approach. According to McRae, this is an incorrect understanding:\n\n[T]he verse attributed to Shenxiu does not in fact refer to gradual or progressive endeavor, but to a constant practice of cleaning the mirror [...] [H]is basic message was that of the constant and perfect teaching, the endless personal manifestation of the bodhisattva ideal.\n\nHuineng's verse does not stand alone, but forms a pair with Shenxiu's verse: Huineng's verse(s) apply the rhetoric of emptiness to undercut the substantiality of the terms of that formulation. However, the basic meaning of the first proposition still remains.\n\nMcRae notes a similarity in reasoning with the Oxhead School, which used a threefold structure of \"absolute, relative and middle\", or \"thesis-antithesis-synthesis\". According to McRae, the Platform Sutra itself is the synthesis in this threefold structure, giving a balance between the need of constant practice and the insight into the absolute.\n\nDoctrinally the Southern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is sudden, while the Northern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This is a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School. Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and \"sudden enlightenment\" became a standard doctrine of Chan.\n\nAccording to tradition Huineng taught \"no-thought\", the \"pure and unattached mind\" which \"comes and goes freely and functions fluently without any hindrance\". \n\nThe alleged Northern school's emphasis on quiet contemplation was criticised by Huineng:\n<poem>:When alive, one keeps sitting without lying down.\n\nThe two paintings to the right were both completed by Liang Kai, a painter from Southern Song dynasty, who left his position as the court painter in Jia Tai's count to practice Chan. These paintings depict Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. The protagonist occupies the lower central portion of both paintings, with his face turned to the side, so that his facial features are not portrayed. \n\nThe Sixth Patriarch Cutting the Bamboo depicts the process that Huineng went through to attain enlightenment and shows Huineng's concentration and contemplation while chopping bamboo. This particular enlightenment moment of his is only documented in this painting, not in any literary sources. He holds an axe in his right hand, and extends his left arm to steady a stalk of bamboo while scrutinizing it. The brushstrokes are loose and free but construct a simplistic and lively image: they indicate a subtle motion of pulling the bamboo towards him. Huineng wears a shirt with sleeves rolled up, which is suggested by the crease at the edges of the shoulders. He puts his extra cloth into a hair bun. The light and dark ink indicate gradation and contrast, and the light shadow on his right arm and body of bamboo implies the source of light.\n\nSimilarly, The Sixth Patriarch Tearing a Sutra adopts a similar style in portraying the same figure, Huineng, performing a different mundane action. This reaffirms the focus of the Southern Chan Tradition, which is to attain sudden enlightenment without having to train to be a monk in the conventional way or to study Buddhist scriptures.\n\nAccording to modern historiography, Huineng was a marginal and obscure historical figure. \n\nModern scholarship has questioned his hagiography, with some researchers speculating that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by Shenhui, a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor to Hongren, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu: \nIn 745, Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze temple in Luoyang. In 753, he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was Guifeng Zongmi. According to Zongmi, Shenhui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when \"an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple\".\n\nA mummified body, supposedly that of Huineng, is kept in Nanhua Temple in Shaoguan (northern Guangdong). This mummy was seen by the Jesuit Matteo Ricci who visited Nanhua Temple in 1589. Ricci told the European readers the story of Huineng (in a somewhat edited form), describing him as akin to a Christian ascetic. Ricci names him \"Liùzǔ\" (i.e. 六祖, \"The Sixth Ancestor\").\n\nThe biography of Huineng explained in the Platform Sutra is a compelling legend of an illiterate, “barbarian” layman who became a Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. Most of what we know about Huineng comes from the Platform Sutra, which consists of the record of a public talk that includes an autobiography of Huineng, which was a hagiography, or “a biography of a saint portraying him as a hero”, and this pseudo-autobiography was written to give authority to the teachings of Huineng. The Sutra became a very popular text to be circulated around, attempting to increase the importance of this exclusive lineage of Huineng. As a history, the account might have been altered over the centuries. Shenhui (685-758) was the first person to claim that Huineng was a saint and hero. As a result of this contested claim, modifications were made to the Platform Sutra, a manuscript copy of which was later found at Dunhuang. \n\nIt turns out that little was known about Huineng before Shenhui's account of him. “It took all the rhetorical skills of Shen-hui and his sympathisers to give a form to the name Huineng,” and hence the character Huineng described by Shenhui was not completely factual. In the Platform Sutra, following Huineng's sermon was a narrative by Fahai, who addressed a few interviews between Huineng and his disciples, including Shenhui. It is likely that “much of the Platform Sutra was built on the inventions of Shenhui”, and the textual evidence suggests that “the work was written soon after his death”. After Huineng's death, Shenhui wanted to claim his authority over Chan Buddhism, but his position was challenged by Shenxiu and Puji, who supported the Northern lineage that taught gradual enlightenment. It is reasonable to assume that this autobiography was likely an attempt by Shenhui to relate himself to the most renowned figures in Zen Buddhism, which essentially enabled him to connect to the Buddha through this lineage. \n\nAn epitaph of Huineng, inscribed by the established poet Wang Wei also reveals inconsistencies with Shenhui's account of Huineng. The epitaph “does not attack Northern Chan, and adds new information on a monk, Yinzong (627-713), who is said to have tonsured Huineng”. Wang Wei was a poet and a government official, whereas Shenhui was a propagandist who preached to the crowd, which again leads to questions about his credibility. \n\n“As far as can be determined from surviving evidence, Shenhui possessed little or no reliable information on Huineng except that he was a disciple of Hongren, lived in Shaozhou, and was regarded by some Chan followers as a teacher of only regional importance”. It seems that Shenhui invented the figure of Huineng for himself to become the “true heir of the single line of transmission from the Buddha in the Southern lineage”, and this appears to be the only way he could have done so. \n\nOn a related note, the Chan Buddhist practices, including the wordless transmission and sudden enlightenment were much different from the traditional training of a monk. “The Chan accounts ridicule every element of the scholar-monk ideal that had taken shape over the centuries in traditional hagiography”, with examples found in the immense literature of the “classical period”. \n\n\n\n"}

His company, Syntonic Research, Inc., is best known for its influential \"environments\" psychoacoustic recording series (1969-1979) and \"The Altered Nixon Speech\" (1973). Teibel was also an accomplished photographer who worked as an editor for Ziff Davis and photographed for \"Popular Photography\" and \"Car and Driver\".\n\nTeibel was born in Buffalo, New York in 1938. He attended the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California before serving in the army as a public information specialist in Stuttgart, Germany. During this time he became interested in electronic music and musique concrète and began experimenting with tape at a local radio station. While in Germany he also claimed to have studied briefly with Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\nTeibel returned from Europe in 1966 and settled in New York City where he worked a number of jobs including associate editor at Ziff Davis. He also took night classes in electronic music at The New School during this time and was a founding resident of the famous Westbeth Artists Community. In 1969, he worked with Tony Conrad on Conrad's film \"Coming Attractions\" which involved recording the ocean at Coney Island. After this experience, Teibel became interested in using natural white noise for psychological purposes. Working with neuropsychologist Lou Gerstman at Bell Labs, he processed a short ocean loop recorded at Brighton Beach through an IBM 360 computer to create one continuous thirty-minute soundscape. This became the first \"environments\" recording, \"The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore.\" The record was unique for its extremely long playback times—30 minutes per side at 33 rpm—and could be played at any speed from 16 up to 45 rpm. \"The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore\" was one of the first commercially available releases edited with a mainframe computer and one of the earlier examples of commercial quadraphonic sound.\n\nIn 1970, Teibel created an environmental sound installation for the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, and in 1971, he began teaching a class in experimental recording techniques at The New School.\n\nIn 1973, to demonstrate how magnetic tape could be manipulated, Teibel edited Richard Nixon’s August 15th speech to reveal that the president, in fact, had “prior knowledge” of the Watergate break-in. In the subsequent years, Teibel performed as an expert witness for magnetic tape technology.\n\nIn 1981, Teibel moved to Austin, Texas, with his then-wife Rosanne. They had two daughters, Jennifer and Dara. He lived in Austin for 29 years until his death on October 28, 2010 at age 72.\n\nHis brother Phil was a violinist with the Buffalo Philharmonic.\n\nOver the years, Teibel's recordings attracted significant national and international attention from publications like \"The New York Times\". Teibel claimed \"environments 6\" was excerpted in the “Sounds of Earth” audio collage aboard the Voyager Spacecraft’s Golden Record (this is still unverified). His work also appears in Terrence Malick’s \"Days of Heaven\", credited as \"special environmental sound recording,\" and Errol Morris' \"Gates of Heaven\" as \"environmental sound.\" In 2013, his work appeared in Lise Raven's film \"Kinderwald\".\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau described Lou Reed's \"Metal Machine Music\" as \"Lou's answer to \"Environments\"\" and Lester Bangs included \"environments 2\" on his list of the \"Ten Most Ridiculous Records of the Seventies.\" Musicians Dominick Fernow and Mica Levi have also listed \"environments\" LPs of among their favorite recordings. \"Outside\" magazine included \"environments 1\" on their list of \"The Top 10 Field Recordings.\" The album cover for the drone metal group Earth's album \"Earth 2\" is an homage to the \"environments 2\" CD with its \"special low frequency version\" message.\n\n\"Atlas Obscura\" has described Teibel as \"a forgotten 1970s-era hippie polymath.\" They go on to explain his lasting influence: \"If you flip on a waterfall to fall asleep, if you keep rainymood.com in your bookmarks, if you associate well-being with the sound of streams and crickets or wonder why the beach never quite sounds as tranquil as you imagine, it's because of Teibel.\"\n\n\"Pitchfork\" elaborates on the novelty of Teibel's work: \"Now, Teibel’s concept—the soothing sounds of nature, or at least a synthesized facsimile of it—is quaint, the wallpaper of therapy waiting rooms and spa foyers. At the time, it was entirely new.\" They go on to explain the complicated place Teibel's work inhabits in the history of field recording and music: \"Here was nature not as it is, but as we hope it’ll be, the lullaby of waves without the sand in our trunks.\"\n\nIn February 2018, the Chicago reissue label Numero Group re-released Teibel's original recordings as an ambient sound app for iOS devices.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14989471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14989471", "title": "Isidor Bush", "text": "Isidor Bush\n\nIsidor Bush or Busch (January 15, 1822, Prague – August 5, 1898, St. Louis, Missouri) was a man of letters, publisher, and viticulturalist. \n\nHis maternal great-grandfather was Israel Hönig, Edler von Hönigsberg, the first Jew raised to nobility in Austria. \n\nWhen fifteen years of age, he entered Anton von Schmid's printing establishment in Vienna, which his father had acquired. The Talmud published with the imprint of Von Schmid and Bush was prized for some time afterwards for its exactness. For six years (1842–47) Bush edited and published the \"Kalender und Jahrbuch für Israeliten\" (Vienna). Its plan was the presentation in the same book of the productions of leading Jewish scholars of divergent views. Among these were Leopold Zunz, S. L. Rapoport, S. D. Luzzatto, Gotthold Salomon, Ludwig Philippson, Michael Sachs, Isaac Noah Mannheimer, Joseph Wertheimer, Leopold Stern, Theodor Creizenach, Ludwig August von Frankl, Leopold Kompert, Leopold Löw, and Simon Szanto. Some of these made their first appearance as writers in the pages of the \"Jahrbücher.\" In 1844 he edited \"Mesillat ha-Limmud\" (Way of Instruction), which was published by his father after Bush had left for America. Liberal in politics, he edited the \"Osterreichisches Zentral-Organ für Glaubensfreiheit\", and other revolutionary papers issued from his press.\n\nWhen the Revolution of 1848 failed he had to flee to New York City, where he arrived Jan. 8, 1849. There Bush opened a store for the sale of newspapers and stationery, and, on March 30, 1849, published the initial number of \"Israel's Herald\", the first Jewish weekly in the United States, which, however, lived only three months. He was assisted in producing it by leading members of the Order B'nai B'rith. In the summer of 1849 Bush went to St. Louis, where he managed a general store for six years. In 1857 Bush was made president of the People's Savings Bank. When the Missouri Convention was called to determine whether the state should join in the secession movement, Bush was chosen a member on the Unconditional Union ticket, and was made a member of the Committee of Nine, to which most important matters were referred.\n\nWhen Fremont took command in 1861, with headquarters in St. Louis, Bush was made his aide-de-camp, with the rank of captain. He submitted to Secretary of the Treasury Chase a plan for a government loan of one hundred million dollars, similar to the famous Rothschild premium loans of Austria. Mr. Chase feared its rejection by Congress, but was impressed with Bush's financial genius, and offered him a Treasury clerkship. Bush returned shortly afterward to St. Louis, and became for six years general freight and passenger agent of the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company. \n\nHe assisted in forming Congregation B'ne El in St. Louis along with Daniel Block and in establishing the Independent Order B'nai B'rith in the West, and was henceforth prominently identified with the Order, rendering especially useful service in connection with its endowment or insurance feature, and in forming the Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum. His interest in the society led him to become an insurance actuary.\n\nBush was chosen member of the state convention called to abolish slavery and to form a new constitution. He was elected a member of the Missouri state board of immigration to repair losses in population resulting from the war, which post he retained for twelve years. Later in life Bush became interested in viticulture. He purchased a tract of land (named by him \"Bushberg\") outside the city, which became noted for its products; and he even sent large quantities of cuttings from his vineyards to France to replace ravages by phylloxera. Bush, after years of preparation, published a catalogue of grapes, \"The Bushberg Catalogue\", which has gone through several editions and has been translated into several languages.\n\nBush died in St. Louis in 1898 and was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery.\n\n"}

Iglesias is recognized as the most commercially successful Continental European singer in the world and one of the top ten record sellers in music history, having sold more than 250 million records worldwide in 14 languages. It is estimated that during his career he has offered more than 5000 concerts, having performed for over 60 million people on five continents. In April 2013 he was awarded in Beijing as the most popular international artist in China. In Brazil, France, Romania, Italy, and others, Iglesias is the most successful foreign record seller, while in his home country, Spain, he has sold the most records in history, with 23 million records.\n\nDuring his career, Iglesias has won many awards in the music industry, including the Grammy, Latin Grammy, World Music Award, Billboard Music Award, American Music Award and Lo Nuestro Award. He has been awarded the Gold Medal for Merit in the Fine Arts of Spain and the Legion of Honour of France. UNICEF named him Special Ambassador for the Performing Arts in 1989. He has been a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame since 1985. In April 2013, Iglesias was inducted into the Hall of Fame of Latin Composers.\n\nIglesias was born in Madrid to Julio Iglesias Sr., a medical doctor from Ourense who became one of the youngest gynecologists in the country, and María del Rosario de la Cueva y Perignat. Iglesias's paternal ancestry comes from Galicia, his paternal grandparents were named Manuela Puga Noguerol and Ulpiano Iglesias Sarria. His maternal grandparents were José de la Cueva y Orejuela (1887–1955), and Dolores de Perignat y Ruiz de Benavides, who was a native of Guayama, Puerto Rico. The name \"Iglesias\" translates as \"churches;\" likewise, Iglesias is of Jewish ancestry from his maternal side, having mentioned that his mother's family name, \"de la Cueva y Perignat,\" meaning literally \"of the cave,\" referring to Jewish people in hiding, is a very common Jewish name. He alternated playing professional football with studying law at the CEU San Pablo University in Madrid. In the earliest years of his young adulthood, he was a goalkeeper for Real Madrid Castilla in the Segunda División. His professional football career was ruined when he was involved in a serious automobile accident, due to which he was unable to walk for two years. Afterwards, he said of those years, \"I had more courage and attitude than talent.\" These were sorely tested when he was involved in that car crash—it smashed his lower spine; his legs were permanently weakened as a direct result, and they still required therapy several years later. During his hospitalization after the accident, a nurse named Eladio Magdaleno gave him a guitar so that he could recover the dexterity of his hands. In learning to play, he discovered his musical talent. After his rehabilitation, Iglesias studied for three months at Bell Educational Trust's Language School in Cambridge, UK. After that, he went back to obtain his law degree at Complutense University of Madrid.\n\nIn 1968, he won the Benidorm International Song Festival, a songwriter's event in Spain, with the song \"La vida sigue igual\" (meaning \"Life Goes On The Same\") which was used in the film \"La vida sigue igual,\" about his own life. After this event he signed a deal with Discos Columbia, the Spanish branch of the Columbia Records company, and released his first studio album, titled \"Yo Canto,\" or \"I Sing.\" The\nalbum spent 15 weeks in the Spanish charts,\nand peaked at #3. He represented Spain in the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest, finishing in fourth place behind Ireland's winning entry, performed by Dana. His entry was the song \"Gwendolyne.\" Shortly after, he had a number one hit in many European countries with \"Un Canto A Galicia,\" sung in Galician, in honour of his father, who hailed from Galicia. That single sold 1 million copies in Germany. In 1975, he found success in the Italian market by recording a song exclusively in Italian, called \"Se mi lasci non vale,\" or \"If You Leave Me, It Can't Be.\" Notable albums from this decade are \"A flor de piel\" (1974, with the European hit \"Manuela\"), \"El amor\" (1975), and \"Soy\" (1973). He also sang in French; one of his popular songs in this language became \"Je n'ai pas changé.\"\n\nIn 1979, he moved to Miami, Florida, in the United States, signed a deal with CBS International, and started singing in different languages such as English, French, Portuguese, German and other languages to his music. Two years later, in 1981, he released the album \"De niña a mujer,\" which he dedicated to his daughter. (She shared the cover photo with him.) From it came the first English-language hit of his career, a Spanish cover of \"Begin the Beguine\" which became number 1 in the United Kingdom; he also released a collection, \"Julio\" (1983). In 1984, he released \"1100 Bel Air Place\", the hit album which established him as a star in the English-speaking entertainment industry. It sold over three million albums in the United States alone. The first single, \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before,\" a duet with Willie Nelson, hit #1 on the Country charts and went Top Five in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It also featured \"All of You,\" in vocal duet with Diana Ross, a Top Twenty Pop hit, that climbed to #2 on the Adult Contemporary Chart with the help of a popular video.\n\nIn 1984, he had recorded and released the previously mentioned duets with Diana Ross and Willie Nelson. Iglesias won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in the 1988 Grammy Awards for the album \"Un hombre solo\" (\"A Man Alone\"). He recorded a duet with Stevie Wonder on \"My Love,\" in his \"Non Stop\" album, a crossover success in 1988. In the 1990s Iglesias returned to his original Spanish melody in \"Tango\" (1996), nominated for Best Latin Pop Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards, losing to the \"Romances\" album by Mexican singer, Luis Miguel.\n\nIglesias made a cameo appearance as himself on \"The Golden Girls\" as Sophia Petrillo's date on St. Valentine's Day 1989. In 2001, Iglesias was recognized as the Person of the Year by the Latin Recording Academy. A year later, Iglesias was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2003, Julio released his album \"Divorcio\" (\"Divorce\"). In its first day of sales, \"Divorcio\" sold a record 350,000 albums in Spain, and reached the number 1 spot on the charts in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and Russia. In 2003 and 2004, aided by the success of his \"Divorcio\" album, Iglesias went on a ten-month world tour which took him from Europe to Asia and then on to North America, South America and Africa. More than half the shows on that tour sold out within days of going on sale. In December 2004, his Dutch girlfriend Miranda Rijnsburger and Iglesias himself recorded a duet of the Christmas song \"Silent Night\". The song, which was not officially released, also included a voice message from Iglesias, Rijnsburger, and their 4 young children of that time. The song was released online through the singer's official website and a CD was included on their Christmas card as a holiday gift from the Iglesias family to their friends and fans around the world.\n\nIn 2008, Iglesias recorded another song as a gift to his fans. The family recorded \"The Little Drummer Boy\" in Spanish and English and included it in the family's Christmas card. Iglesias also made investments in the Dominican Republic's eastern town of Punta Cana, a major tourist destination, where he took to spending most of the year. Indeed, Iglesias became a Dominican citizen in 2005.\n\nIn September 2006, Iglesias released a new English-language album, which he titled \"Romantic Classics.\" \"I've chosen songs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that I believe will come to be regarded as the new standards,\" Iglesias stated in the album's sleeve notes. The album featured his interpretations of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is,\" the Wham! selection \"Careless Whisper,\" and Richard Marx's \"Right Here Waiting.\" \"Romantic Classics\" was Iglesias's highest debut on the Billboard charts, entering at number 31 in the United States, 21 in Canada, 10 in Australia, and top spots across Europe and Asia. He returned to the studio to record songs in Filipino and Indonesian for his Asian releases of \"Romantic Classics\" which helped propel record sales in the Asian entertainment industry. Iglesias promoted \"Romantic Classics\" in 2006; it was seen all over the world on television shows. In the United States, for example, he appeared on \"Dancing With The Stars,\" where he sang his version of \"I Want To Know What Love Is,\" \"Good Morning America\", \"The View,\" \"Fox and Friends,\" and \"Martha Stewart.\"\n\nIn 2008, Iglesias made a music video with Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of Uzbek dictator Islam Karimov.\n\nIn March 2011, the artist launched a new studio album called \"1\" (or \"Numero 1\").\n\nIglesias's performance of the song \"La Mer\" (\"The Sea\") is featured in the soundtrack of the 2011 film \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.\" The performance comes from a live album, which had gone out of print by the last days of December 2015, that he recorded live at the Olympia theater in Paris in 1976. At the beginning and the end of the recording, Iglesias introduces the song, and his backing musicians, in fluent French.\n\nIn October 2012, Iglesias performed a concert in Equatorial Guinea, where tickets were reportedly $1,000 each.\n\nOn 1 April 2013, in Beijing, he received two historic awards: First & Most Popular International Artist of All Time in China, an award given by Sony Music China and which was presented to Julio by the world-renowned Chinese artist Lang Lang, and the Guinness World Records for the Best-selling Male Latin Artist. As Iglesias is a composer and lyricist, some of his songs being of his own authorship and composition, on 23 April 2013, he was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame, alongside Armando Manzanero and José Feliciano.\n\nIn 2015, as was announced, Iglesias was slated to perform a concert (complete show) for the first time with his son Julio Iglesias Jr. in a tour in Romania, on 22 May at Sala Polivalentă in Cluj-Napoca and 2 July at Sala Palatului in the capital city, Bucharest.\n\nOn 29 January 1971, Iglesias married Isabel Preysler, a Filipina journalist and television host. Preysler, a Filipino of Spanish ancestry, was also a member of the wealthy and aristocratic Perez de Tagle family. The couple had three children: Chabeli (born 3 September 1971), a socialite; Julio Jr. (born 25 February 1973), a singer; and Enrique (born 8 May 1975), an internationally successful singer-songwriter, actor, and record producer. In the 1970s, Iglesias and his family were extensively depicted on the front pages of international newspapers and magazines. The marriage of Iglesias and Preysler ended in divorce in 1979.\n\nWhenever Iglesias was not on tour, he spent his time at his Miami residence, purchased in 1978 for $650,000. The mansion on the private Indian Creek Island, whose interior design was made by his true love Virginia Sipl \"LA FLACA\", was placed on the market in 2006 for a quoted $28 million, making it one of \"Ten Most Expensive Homes in the South\" in 2006 according to \"Forbes\" magazine.\n\nAfter his divorce, Iglesias lived with Dutch model Miranda Rijnsburger (b. 1965), 22 years his junior, whom he married on 26 August 2010 in a small church in Marbella, Spain. They had five children: Miguel Alejandro Iglesias (born 7 September 1997), Rodrigo Iglesias (born 3 April 1999), twins Cristina and Victoria Iglesias (born 1 May 2001), and Guillermo Iglesias (born 5 May 2007). They took up residence in the Dominican Republic, where Iglesias had acquired several hotel complexes, as well as the Punta Cana International Airport, which he acquired jointly with other investors, including fashion designer Oscar de la Renta.\n\nOn 19 December 2005, Iglesias's father, Julio Iglesias Sr., died of a heart attack at the age of 90. A week before his death, it became known that the 42-year-old wife of Julio Iglesias Sr., Ronna Keith, was pregnant with their second child. Their first child, Jaime, was born on 18 May 2004. The second child, Ruth, was born on 26 July 2006.\n\nIn 2008, after his house in Indian Creek did not sell at his asking price, he ordered it razed and said he planned to build another on the lot. In 2012, he purchased the property next door for $15 million and announced that he planned to build a new home on the combined properties.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22567219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22567219", "title": "Knut Alvsson", "text": "Knut Alvsson\n\nKnut Alvsson (1455 – 18 August 1502) was a Norwegian nobleman and landowner. He was the country's foremost Norwegian-born noble in his time and served as fief-holder in southern-central Norway.\n\nHe was heir of the Sudreim claim to the Norwegian throne in accordance with the order of succession agreed to by Norwegian nobility and religious leadership when the Sverre dynasty became extinct. From 1497 to 1499 he served as commander of Akershus Fortress but was removed in 1499 when he lost King Hans' confidence. In 1501 he led a rebellion against King Hans in Norway. He met his death at the hands of pro-Danish Henrich Krummedige’s men in spite of a promise of safe conduct, effectively weakening the rebellion severely as well as ending a feud which had started with their fathers, Hartvig Krummedige and Alv Knutsson.\n\nKnut Alvsson was the son of Norwegian National Council member Alv Knutsson and his wife Magnhild Oddsdotter (ca. 1425–1499). He was the brother of \nOdd Alvsson (1460–1497), who was chief of Akershus fortress, and half-brother of Karl Sigurdsson (1476–1487), who served as Bishop of the Diocese of Hamar. He was descended on his paternal grandfather’s side from the influential and wealthy Swedish \"Tre Rosor\" noble family, which were active during the period of the Kalmar Union.\nHe inherited the Giske and Sudreim properties from his father, one of the largest estate owners in Norway, as well as goods and property in Romerike from his brother Odd Alvsson, who died in 1497. He also held extensive properties in Sweden through his first marriage to the Swedish noblewoman Gyrvel Gyllenstjerna. Alvsson's property would be later forfeit to the crown. His estate in large part would subsequently be awarded to his granddaughter, Görvel Fadersdotter.\n\nKnut Alvsson inherited a long-standing feud with members of the family of Henrich Krummedige. As a member of the pro-Swedish faction on the Norwegian council of the realm, Alvsson was in natural opposition to Krummedige, who was a key member of the pro-Danish faction.\n\nIn the autumn of 1497 Alvsson's sheriff to Romerike, Lasse Skjold, was killed by the people of the district. Alvsson received an open letter about the incident, which proclaimed that common people in the Nes and Ullensaker stood together in the action in protest of his oppressive tax collection practices.\n\nAlvsson discussed the rebellion of his people with the Danish and Norwegian councils of the realm, and following their recommendation, asked the offenders to apply for amnesty but they held him responsible for his sheriff’s actions. The farmers chose to exercise their ancient right to summon a thing at Aker to submit their grievances and hear their defense for what they believed was a justified killing. They also intended to summon Alvsson to the thing.\n\nThese actions, combined with signs that the rebellion was spreading throughout the \"sønnafjells\" (the region of Norway south of the Dovre mountains). Alvsson was unable to quell the farmers' rebellion. The rebellion grew such that he was forced to request assistance from the commander of the Norwegian Båhus fortress, his rival and enemy, Henrich Krummedige, since the latter had demonstrated his ability to work constructively with his local land owners. Krummedige not only failed to support Alvsson, but informed the king of the matter. Alvsonn was relieved of his command of Akershus Fortress and replaced by Peder Griis, a Danish nobleman loyal to the king.\n\nIn 1500 King Hans of Denmark, Sweden and Norway made an ill-fated attempt to conquer the Ditmarshes in Northern Germany. Alvsson, who had married the granddaughter of Swedish King Karl Knutsson, and was involved with the Swedish Independence Party, concluded it was time to act. While in Sweden he participated in the Swedish National Council meeting in Vadstena Castle in 1501, at which the council approved the revolt against King Hans]. Alvsson directed harsh accusations against King Hans' control in Norway and was provided Swedish support for his return to Norway, based on the belief that a Norwegian uprising would quickly follow the Swedish uprising. In 1501 he led Swedish forces in an attack on Båhus Fortress on the Swedish-Norwegian border, which Henrich Krummedige still commanded. Krummedige was able to hold his fief of Båhus, but Alvsson captured Akershus Fortress in March 1502, although the citizens of Oslo remained pro-Danish while the nobles and bishops of the country remained neutralpresumably waiting to see which side prevailed.\n\nKing Hans dispatched his son Christian (later crowned King Christian II of Denmark and Norway) at the head of Danish forces; they relieved the siege of Båhus Fortress, and also captured Älvsborg Fortress across the river from Båhus Fortress in Gothenburg. Krummedige then led forces north to finish off the rebellion by recapturing Tønsberg Fortress and investing Akershus Fortress, which Alvsson was defending.\n\nWhen it became clear that the rebellion was stalemated, Alvsson came on board one of Krummedige's ships under a safe conduct. Krummedige's men killed Alvsson on 18 August 1502, either by treachery or, as alleged by Krummedige's men, in response to Alvsson's own violence. Breaking the rules of safe conduct was considered a grave treachery after the old Norse laws, which were still used in Norway at the time. However, the court in Oslo deemed Krummedige to have acted justly. The conditions for this judgement have been discussed by historians for years.\n\nThe crown judged Alvsson a traitor. Krummedige had prevailed, although Gjerset reports he was compelled to leave Norway and the uprising was not totally quelled until December 1504. Alvsson's death at the hand of Krummedige’s minions caused the rebellion against the king to collapse. It also solidified the Danish-Norwegian ties and marked the last attempt at Norwegian independence for over 300 years.\n\nThe death of Alvsson has been romanticized to serve as a centerpiece for Norwegian Romantic Nationalism. Ibsen characterized the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1537—1814)as \"Four Hundred Years of Darkness\" as part of the Norwegian nationalistic romantic literature upwelling in the close of the 18th century. For example, it was used to set an anti-Danish tone in Ibsen's play \"Fru Inger til Østeraad\", when he has Olaf Skaktavl acclaim: \"Recall the afternoon when Hendrik Krummedike came before Akershus fortress with his fleet? The captains of the fleet offered to discuss peace terms; and, trusting a safe conduct, Knut Alfsøn went onboard. Only three hours later we had to carry him through the fortress gate ... Norway's bravest heart was lost when Krummedike's minions struck him down...\"\n"}

{"id": "1154494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154494", "title": "Naram-Sin of Akkad", "text": "Naram-Sin of Akkad\n\nNaram-Sin (also transcribed Narām-Sîn or Naram-Suen, meaning \"Beloved of Sin\"; reigned c. 2254–2218 BC,) was a ruler of the Akkadian Empire, the third successor and grandson of King Sargon of Akkad. Under Naram-Sin the empire reached its maximum strength. He was the first Mesopotamian king known to have claimed divinity for himself, taking the title \"God of Akkad\", and one of the first (following the earlier Lugal-Anne-Mundu) to claim the title \"King of the Four Quarters, King of the Universe\". <br> <br>\n\nNaram-Sin was born as a son of Manishtushu. He was thus a nephew of King Rimush and grandson of Sargon and Tashlultum. Naram-Sin's aunt was the High Priestess En-hedu-ana.\n\nNaram-Sin defeated Manium of Magan, and various northern hill tribes in the Zagros, Taurus, and Amanus Mountains, expanding his empire up to the Mediterranean Sea and Armenia. His \"Victory Stele\" depicts his triumph over Satuni, chief of Lullubi in the Zagros Mountains. The king list gives the length of his reign as 56 years, and at least 20 of his year-names are known, referring to military actions against various places such as Uruk and Subartu. One unknown year was recorded as \"the Year when Naram-Sin was victorious against Simurrum in Kirasheniwe and took prisoner Baba the governor of Simurrum, and Dubul the \"ensi\" of Arame\". Other year names refer to his construction work on temples in Akkad, Nippur, and Zabala. He also built administrative centers at Nagar and Nineveh. At one point in his reign much of the empire, led by Iphur-Kis from the city of Kish rose in rebellion and was put down strongly. \n\nOne Mesopotamian myth, a historiographic poem entitled \"The curse of Akkad: the Ekur avenged\", explains how the empire created by Sargon of Akkad fell and the city of Akkad was destroyed. The myth was written hundreds of years after Naram-Sin's life and is the poet's attempt to explain how the Gutians succeeded in conquering Sumer. After an opening passage describing the glory of Akkad before its destruction, the poem tells of how Naram-Sin angered the chief god Enlil by plundering the Ekur (Enlil's temple in Nippur.) In his rage, Enlil summoned the Gutians down from the hills east of the Tigris, bringing plague, famine and death throughout Mesopotamia. Food prices became vastly inflated, with the poem stating that 1 lamb would buy only half a \"sila\" (about 425 ml) of grain, half a \"sila\" of oil, or half a \"mina\" (about 250g) of wool. To prevent this destruction, eight of the gods (namely Inanna, Enki, Sin, Ninurta, Utu, Ishkur, Nusku, and Nidaba) decreed that the city of Akkad should be destroyed in order to spare the rest of Sumer and cursed it. This is exactly what happens, and the story ends with the poet writing of Akkad's fate, mirroring the words of the gods' curse earlier on: \n\n\"Its canalboat towpaths grew nothing but weeds,<br>\nIts chariot roads grew nothing but the 'wailing plant,'<br>\nMoreover, on its canalboat towpaths and landings,<br>\nNo human being walks because of the wild goats, vermin, snakes, and mountain scorpions,<br>\nThe plains where grew the heart-soothing plants, grew nothing but the 'reed of tears,'<br>\nAkkad, instead of its sweet-flowing water, there flowed bitter water,<br>\nWho said \"I would dwell in that city\" found not a good dwelling place,<br>\nWho said \"I would lie down in Akkad\" found not a good sleeping place.\"\n\nThese Gutian raids were indeed devastating, but it is unknown how badly they affected Sumer. Naram-Sin may have passed on his empire to his son Shar-Kali-Sharri more or less intact upon his death in c. 2219 BC, or he may have passed on little more than Akkad itself. However it is clear that soon after the death of Naram-Sin, the Akkadian Empire came under increasing pressure from the more and more frequent Gutian incursions, to the point that by c. 2100 BC, it seems that all of Akkad except the city itself was in the hands of the Gutians. The Gutians remained there for over 100 years before being replaced by the Ur III state as the dominant political power.\n\nNaram-Sin's Victory Stele depicts him as a god-king (symbolized by his horned helmet) climbing a mountain above his soldiers, and his enemies, the defeated Lullubi. Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the Elamite forces of Shutruk-Nakhunte, it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin. The stele seems to break from tradition by using successive diagonal tiers to communicate the story to viewers, however the more traditional horizontal frames are visible on smaller broken pieces. It is six feet and seven inches tall, and made from pink limestone. The stele was found at Susa, and is now in the Louvre Museum. A similar \"bas-relief\" depicting Naram-Sin was found a few miles north-east of Diarbekr, at Pir Hüseyin.\n\nAmong the known sons of Naram-Sin were his successor Shar-Kali-Sharri, Nabi-Ulmash, who\nwas governor of Tutub, and a Ukin-Ulmash. Excavations at Tell Mozan (ancient Urkesh) brought to light a sealing of Tar'am-Agade, a previously unknown daughter of Naram-Sin, who was possibly married to an unidentified \"endan\" (ruler) of Urkesh.\n\n\n\n"}

He served as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople and in 1581 published a book about his time there, \"Itinera Constantinopolitanum et Amasianum\", re-published in 1595 under the title of \"Turcicae epistolae\" or \"Turkish Letters\".\n\nHe was born the illegitimate son of the \"Seigneur de Busbecq\", Georges Ghiselin, and his mistress Catherine Hespiel, although he was later legitimated. He grew up at Busbecq Castle (in present-day Bousbecque, Nord, France), studying in Wervik and Comines - at the time, all part of Spanish West Flanders, a province of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBusbecq's intellectual gifts led him to advanced studies at the Latin-language University of Leuven, where he registered in 1536 under the name \"Ogier Ghislain de Comines\". From there, he went on to study at a number of well-known universities in northern Italy, including taking classes from in Venice.\n\nLike his father and grandfather, Busbecq chose a career of public service. He started work in the court of the Austrian monarch Ferdinand I in approximately 1552. In 1554, he was sent to England for the marriage in Winchester of the English queen Mary Tudor to Philip II of Spain.\n\nIn 1554 and again in 1556, Ferdinand named him ambassador to the Ottoman Empire under the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent. His task for much of the time he was in Constantinople was the negotiation of a border treaty between his employer (the future Holy Roman Emperor) and the Sultan over the disputed territory of Transylvania. He had no success in this mission while Rustem Pasha was the Sultan's vizier, but ultimately reached an accord with his successor Semiz Ali Pasha.\n\nDuring his stay in Constantinople, he wrote his best known work, the \"Turkish Letters\", a compendium of personal correspondence to his friend, and fellow Hungarian diplomat, Nicholas Michault, in Flanders and some of the world's first travel literature. These letters describe his adventures in Ottoman politics and remain one of the principal primary sources for students of the 16th-century Ottoman court. He also wrote in enormous detail about the plant and animal life he encountered in Turkey. His letters also contain the only surviving word list of Crimean Gothic, a Germanic dialect spoken at the time in some isolated regions of Crimea.\n\nBusbecq discovered an almost complete copy of the \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\", an account of Roman emperor Augustus' life and accomplishments, at the Monumentum Ancyranum in Ancyra. He identified its origin from his reading of Suetonius and published a copy of parts of it in his Turkish Letters.\n\nHe was an avid collector, acquiring valuable manuscripts, rare coins and curios of various kinds. Among the best known of his discoveries was a 6th-century copy of Dioscorides' \"De Materia Medica\", a compendium of medicinal herbs. The emperor purchased it after Busbecq's recommendation; the manuscript is now known as the Vienna Dioscorides. His passion for herbalism led him to send Turkish tulip bulbs to his friend Charles de l'Écluse, who acclimatized them to life in the Low Countries. Busbecq has also been credited with introducing the lilac to northern Europe (though this is debated) as well as the Angora goat.\n\nHe returned from Turkey in 1562 and became a counsellor at the court of Emperor Ferdinand in Vienna and tutor to his grandchildren, the sons of future Emperor Maximilian II. Busbecq ended his career as the guardian of Elisabeth of Austria, Maximilian's daughter and widow of French king Charles IX. He continued to serve the Austrian monarchy, observing the development of the French Wars of Religion on behalf of Rudolf II. Finally, in 1592 and nearing the end of his life, he chose to leave his residence in Mantes outside of Paris for his native West Flanders, but was assaulted and robbed by members of the Catholic League near Rouen. He died a few days later. His body is buried in the castle chapel at Saint-Germain-sous-Cailly near where he died, and his heart was embalmed and sent to the family tomb in Bousbecque.\n\n\nBusbecq brought some manuscripts from Constantinople:\n\n"}

{"id": "2973567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2973567", "title": "Omayra Sánchez", "text": "Omayra Sánchez\n\nOmayra Sánchez Garzón (August 28, 1972 – November 16, 1985) was a 13-year-old Colombian girl killed in Armero, Tolima, by the 1985 eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. Volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive lahars (volcanically induced mudflows, landslides, and debris flows) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.\n\nAfter a lahar demolished her home, Sánchez was pinned beneath the debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely as a result of either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.\n\nA photograph of Sánchez taken by the photojournalist Frank Fournier shortly before she died was published in news outlets around the world. It was later designated the World Press Photo of the Year for 1985. Sánchez has remained a lasting figure in popular culture, remembered through music, literature, and commemorative articles.\n\nOn November 13, 1985, the Nevado del Ruiz volcano erupted. At 9:09 pm of that night, pyroclastic flows exploding from the crater melted the mountain's icecap, forming lahars (volcanic mudflows and debris flows) which cascaded into river valleys below. One lahar, consisting of three pulses, did most of the damage. Traveling at per second, the first pulse enveloped most of the town of Armero, killing up to 20,000 people; the two later pulses weakened buildings. Another lahar killed 1,800 people in nearby Chinchiná. In total 23,000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to Armero were destroyed.\n\nLoss of life was exacerbated by the authorities' failure to take costly preventive measures in the absence of clear signs of imminent danger. There had been no substantial eruption of the volcano since 1845, which contributed to complacency; locals called the volcano the \"Sleeping Lion\".\n\nIn September 1985, as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked the area around the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October; it highlighted the danger from falling ash and rock near Murillo, Santa Isabel, and Líbano, as well as the threat of lahars in Mariquita, Guayabal, Chinchiná, and Armero. The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk: many survivors had never heard of it, though several major newspapers had featured it. Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but had \"met with strong opposition from economic interests.\" He said that the short time between the map's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution.\n\nThe Colombian Congress criticised scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering, and the government and army were preoccupied with the guerrilla campaign in Bogotá, the national capital, which was then at its height.\n\nThe death toll was increased by the lack of early warnings, unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars, and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano. Colombia's worst natural disaster, the Armero tragedy (as it came to be known) was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée). It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD. Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history.\n\nOmayra Sánchez lived in the neighborhood of Santander with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and sorghum collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique and aunt María Adela Garzón. Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business. The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar. After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof. Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was \"trapped up to her neck\", while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.\n\nFor the first few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by concrete but got her hand through a crack in the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood over the course of a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.\n\nDespite her predicament, Sánchez remained relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, a journalist who was working as a volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that she did not want to be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.\n\nHer brother survived the lahars; her father and aunt died. Her mother expressed her feelings about Omayra's death: \"It is horrible, but we have to think about the living ... I will live for my son, who only lost a finger.\"\n\nAs the public became aware of Sánchez's situation through the media, her death became a symbol of the failure of officials to properly assist victims who could have been saved. Controversy broke out after descriptions of the shortages were released in newspapers, disproving what officials had previously indicated: that they had used the best of their supplies. Volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels, cutting tools, and stretchers ran out. The rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization. An unnamed police officer said that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized. Colombia's Minister of Defense, Miguel Uribe, said he \"understood criticism of the rescue effort\", but said that Colombia was \"an undeveloped country\" that did not \"have that kind of equipment.\"\n\nFrank Fournier, a French reporter who landed in Bogotá on November 15, took a photograph of Sánchez in her final days, titled \"The Agony of Omayra Sánchez\". When he reached Armero at dawn on the 16th, a farmer directed him to Sánchez, who by then had been trapped for nearly three days and was near-deserted. Fournier later described the town as \"very haunting,\" with \"eerie silence\" punctuated by screaming. He said that he took the photograph feeling that he could only \"report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl\" in his attempt to publicize the disaster's need for relief efforts, feeling otherwise \"powerless\".\n\nAt the time, there was international awareness of the disaster. Sánchez was one of the victims at the center of the associated controversy over responsibility for the destructive aftermath. The image captured international attention. According to an unnamed BBC reporter, \"Many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra's life.\" After the photo was published in \"Paris Match,\" many accused Fournier of being \"a vulture.\" He responded, \n\"I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it. ... I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country's leaders.\" The picture later won the World Press Photo of the Year for 1985.\n\nThe Armero catastrophe came shortly after the M-19 guerrilla group's raid and subsequent Palace of Justice siege on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation. After Sánchez's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano's eruption.\n\nThe Nevado del Ruiz volcano is still active, according to the Volcano Watch Center in Colombia. Melting only 10 percent of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to —similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985. Such lahars can travel up to along river valleys in a few hours. Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk. The city of Armero no longer exists. The site was commemorated as a memorial with Christian crosses and a small monument to Sánchez.\n\nIn the years following the eruption, Sánchez has been repeatedly commemorated, especially in newspapers like \"El Tiempo\". Many victims of the disaster were commemorated, but Sánchez in particular has attracted lasting attention in popular poetry, novels, and music.\n\nFor example, a punk rock band formed in Chile in 2008 named themselves Omayra Sánchez; they express their \"discontent that they feel with the negligence on the part of the people who in this day and age run the world\". \"Adiós, Omayra: La catástrofe de Armero\" (1988), written by Eduardo Santa as a response to the eruption, depicts the girl's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe. In \"No Morirás\" (1994), Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero, nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house. Isabel Allende's short story, \"And of Clay Are We Created\" (\"De barro estamos hechos\"), is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home. Allende later wrote, \"Her [Sánchez's] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me in my dreams. Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost.\"\n\nTo try to prevent repetition of such a disaster, the government of Colombia created the \"Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres\" (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the \"Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres\" (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness). All Colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters.\n\n"}
{"id": "966515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=966515", "title": "Pete Sessions", "text": "Pete Sessions\n\nPeter Anderson Sessions (born March 22, 1955) is an American politician. He has represented Texas's 32nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party. He is the current chairman of the House Rules Committee and a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. He was defeated for re-election by Democratic challenger Colin Allred in the November 6, 2018 election.\n\nSessions was born in Waco, Texas, the son of Alice June (née Lewis) and William Steele Sessions, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He grew up in Waco and in the suburbs of Washington, DC. He graduated from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas in 1978, where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He worked for Southwestern Bell for 16 years and rose to the rank of district manager for marketing in Dallas.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America recognized him as a \"Distinguished Eagle Scout.\" He holds a position on the Circle Ten Council of the BSA. Both of his sons are also active in scouting.\n\nIn his 1991 election bid, Sessions finished sixth in a special election for the House of Representatives. In 1993, he left his job with Southwestern Bell to again run for Congress, against 5th District incumbent Democratic Congressman John Bryant. He toured the district with a livestock trailer full of horse manure, claiming that the Clinton Administration's health care plan stank more than the manure. He lost by 2,400 votes. He subsequently became vice president for public policy at the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA), a Dallas-based conservative public policy research institute.\nIn 1996, when Bryant decided to seek a Senate seat, Sessions was elected to succeed him in the 5th District, defeating Democratic candidate John Pouland with 47 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 1998, defeating schoolteacher Victor Morales with 56 percent of the vote. In 2000, he ran against Regina Montoya Coggins, and was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote. When redistricting after the 2000 Census made the 5th slightly more Democratic, he moved to the newly created 32nd District for the 2002 election, in which he ran against Pauline Dixon and won the district with 68 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2004, Sessions defeated 13-term, Democratic incumbent Congressman Martin Frost, who had moved to the 32nd after the redistricting in 2003 eliminated Frost's former district. He won 54–44%, in what was considered the most expensive U.S. House race in the nation. According to the Associated Press, \"The race also was one of the nastiest, with Frost unearthing a decades-old streaking incident by Sessions in his college days and questioning his commitment to security with an ad featuring the World Trade Center towers in flames. In response, he criticized Frost for booking Peter Yarrow of the 1960s group Peter, Paul and Mary for a fundraiser. Yarrow had faced an indecency with a child charge years earlier.\"\n\nIn 2010, he faced Dallas businessman and attorney Grier Raggio and Libertarian John Jay Myers. The election was initially considered one of the top dark horse battles in the country, but Sessions won re-election. In 2012, he faced the Democratic candidate, Katherine Savers McGovern, and independent, Seth Hollis. He was endorsed by the \"Dallas Morning News\" and won re-election. In the 2014 Republican primary, Sessions defeated conservative Katrina Pierson, an African American and a favorite of the Tea Party movement. He polled 28,954 votes (63.6 percent) to her 16,560 (36.4 percent). Pierson, originally allied with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, later joined the Donald Trump presidential campaign staff.\n\nIn 2016, Sessions polled 49,632 votes (61.4 percent) to gain re-nomination in the Republican congressional primary, which had a much greater turnout than in 2014. The runner-up, Russ K. Ramsland of Dallas, received 19,105 votes (23.6%). Paul M. Brown of Richardson received 9,488 votes (11. 7%). Cherie Myint Roughneen received 2601 votes (3.2%).\n\nHe lost his bid for re-election in 2018 to Colin Allred.\n\nIn the 2010 election, during his tenure as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party gained control of the House with significant gains. They won a net gain of 63 seats and 89 new freshman members.\n\nIn 2014, Sessions was originally a candidate for the post of House majority leader, to replace Eric Cantor. However, Sessions withdrew from the internal House Republican Conference election, leaving the field clear for Kevin McCarthy of California.\n\n\nIn 2012, he was named chairman of the House Rules Committee for the 113th Congress by Speaker of the House John Boehner. Sessions has retained his chairmanship into the 115th Congress.\n\n\nAs of August 2017, Sessions voted with his party in 98.8% of votes so far in the current (115th) session of Congress and voted in line with President Trump's position in 97.5% of votes.\n\nIn late 2001 and early 2002, he cosigned letters to two Cabinet members asking them to shut down casinos operated by several Native American tribes. Within 18 months of sending the letters, he received a total of $20,500 from tribes associated with Jack Abramoff. In response to criticism, his office said that he wrote the letters because of his view that gambling is a local issue, falling under his long-held support for federalism.\n\nIn 2008, he added a $1.6 million earmark to an appropriations bill, for dirigible research. The earmark benefited a Chicago company, Jim G. Ferguson & Associates, which had no experience in government contracting or dirigible research. Former Sessions aide and convicted felon Adrian Plesha was a lobbyist for the firm.\n\nIn September, Adrian Plesha sued Jim G. Ferguson & Associates for non-payment of fees and expenses connected with his lobbying effort on their behalf.\n\nIn March 2016, Sessions introduced a House resolution to \"recognize magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure.\"\n\nSessions opposes allowing states to determine their own policies regarding the legality of cannabis and the regulation of legal cannabis markets. As chairman of the House Rules Committee, he has repeatedly stifled proposed amendments relaxing federal laws against cannabis, including an amendment that would have allowed medical marijuana access to veterans in states where the drug is legal.\n\nSessions is a supporter of the 1033 program, under which the U.S. military transfers surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies; the program is controversial because of its association with militarization of police. In 2015 and 2017, Sessions cosponsored Republican legislation to reverse the Obama administration's restrictions on the 1033 program.\n\nIn 2012, Sessions voted against disaster relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. In August 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, Sessions called for disaster relief for the victims of Harvey.\n\nIn 2016, Sessions criticized the independent, nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), saying that the office was \"a political witch hunt\" and calling it \"an outside process that's very controversial, is not working well and is highly unpopular because of its original mandate and jurisdiction is hugely flawed.\" In 2017, Sessions publicly defended a House Republican plan to dismantle the OCE; the plan was abandoned after a public uproar.\n\nAlso in 2017, Sessions sponsored a bill to delay, for nine years, the full implementation of 2015 ozone standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration; the bill passed the House, largely on party lines.\n\nSessions supported the North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014, a bill that would exempt the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) from prosecution under the Lacey Act for transferring water containing invasive species from Oklahoma to Texas. The Lacey Act protects plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for various violations, including transferring invasive species across state borders. Sessions argued that the bill was necessary to prevent \"more than 1.5 million customers of the North Texas Municipal Water District\" from facing \"restricted access to water as a result of the discovery of invasive species in Lake Texoma.\"\n\nSessions drew controversy in 2016 when he asserted that the site of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the scene of a mass shooting attack, was not a gay club.\n\nSessions opposes abortion and supports defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nSessions favors repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or \"Obamacare\"). Sessions supported the March 2017 version of the American Health Care Act, the House Republicans' replacement plan for the ACA. On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the ACA and pass the American Health Care Act.\n\nIn September 2010, Sessions remarked after watching the Princeton University men's basketball team, \"How often can you go see a bunch of white guys play basketball?\" He also reportedly said that the players stayed entirely below the rim. The comments were described as an allusion to the phrase \"White Men Can't Jump\", and were labeled as inappropriate by New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell.\n\nLess than two weeks after his \"white guys\" comments he made controversial comments about the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) giving money to and supporting, \"African Americans like Sanford Bishop. And when you have to retreat back to ... your hard base you're having to make tough decisions.\"\n\nSessions voted against the DREAM Act in 2010.\n\nSessions supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order imposing a temporary ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations. He stated that \"Just as President Obama suspended the refugee program in 2011 for six months, the Trump Administration is working to protect national security by making adjustments in the refugee vetting process. It is critical that we address the threat of individuals who come to our country to create chaos and threaten our freedom.\"\n\nIn 2017, Sessions suggested that Congress could appropriate funds for part of construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall demanded by Trump as part of \"a Republican-only bill\" to continue funding the government.\n\nSessions came under scrutiny for his personal ties to disgraced banker Allen Stanford, who in 2012 was convicted of orchestrating a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. Sessions received over $44,000 in political contributions from Stanford and his associates. Sessions also took multiple trips to Fire Island and to the Caribbean to attend Stanford-sponsored events; these trips included private travel on Stanford's fleet of jets and accommodations. In 2014, VICE News obtained records from Stanford's internal files that indicated that in 2007 and 2008, before the scandal came to light, Sessions had intervened with the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, on Stanford's behalf, allowing him to bypass certain Cuban embargo restrictions. Additionally, in 2004, Sessions (along with two other Republican congressmen, Bob Ney and John E. Sweeney) wrote to Venezuelan banking regulators, \"vouching for Stanford's character when Stanford was trying to obtain a charter to open a bank in the country, at a time when regulators there were reluctant because of reports they had received that Stanford was running a Ponzi scheme and engaged in money laundering.\"\n\nIn 2017, Sessions, as chairman of the House Rules Committee, stalled a bill imposing additional sanctions against Russia and Iran from moving to the floor; Sessions expressed the view that some parts of the bill, which passed the Senate on a 98-2 vote, could create \"huge problems to companies in Dallas, Texas, that I represent\" and place them at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn July 2018, Sessions argued that it was unnecessary to increase federal funding for election security. The US intelligence community had concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that it was continuing to interfere in election systems as of July 2018.\n\nIn early February 2009, Sessions made the following comment about the Republican Party legislative strategy in the House of Representatives: \"Insurgency, we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban\", he said, during the 60-minute sitdown. \"And that is that they went about systematically understanding how to disrupt and change a person's entire processes.\" He continued: \"I'm not trying to say the Republican Party is the Taliban... I'm saying an example of how you go about [it] is to change a person from their messaging to their operations to their frontline message. And we need to understand that insurgency may be required when the other side, the House leadership, does not follow the same commands, which we entered the game with.\"\n\nIn January 2012, it was reported that Sessions received a so-called \"VIP\" or \"Friends of Angelo\" loan in 2007 from troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, in which loans were granted at lower interest rates than were available to the public. Former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo created the program to boost the company's standing with politicians, celebrities and well-connected business figures. He received a $1 million loan from Countrywide at below-market rates, which he never declared in financial disclosures. His, as well as names of other legislators who received similar loans were subsequently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as part of an ethics investigation into improper gifts. He was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform when their investigation revealed he did not receive any preferential treatment or a below market interest rate on his mortgage from Countrywide.\n\nDuring the 2013 government shutdown, after being questioned by another individual regarding his position on the shutdown and his presence at the National World War II Memorial, which was open while other National Park Service monuments and parks remained closed, he replied that \"we're not the French; we don't surrender.\" As the chairman of the House Rules Committee, Sessions had in fact introduced HR 368 to a vote in the House which allowed the shutdown to take place; Sessions voted in favor of the bill and therefore the shutdown.\n\nIn 2008, Sessions introduced legislation that created a commemorative silver dollar coin celebrating the centennial of the Boy Scouts of America. The bill passed the House on a 403-8 vote and passed the Senate unanimously; it was signed into law by President George W. Bush.\n\nIn February 1984, Sessions married Juanita \"Nete\" Diaz. They have two sons. In August 2011, they divorced after 27 years of marriage.\nIn August 2012, Sessions married Karen Diebel, a 2010 congressional candidate in Florida and a Trump Administration appointee to the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\n\n"}
{"id": "31666409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31666409", "title": "Phineas Clanton", "text": "Phineas Clanton\n\nPhineas Fay Clanton (December 1843 – January 5, 1906) was the son of Newman Haynes Clanton and the brother of Billy and Ike Clanton. He was witness to and possibly played a part in a number of illegal activities during his life. He moved frequently in his early life from Missouri to California and to Arizona.\n\nTheir father was implicated in the ambush and murder of a number of Mexican smugglers in July 1881. The following month he was killed by Mexican Rurales. Phin's brother Ike Clanton had an ongoing series of conflicts with Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp and was accused of cattle rustling among other things. Phin and his brothers developed bitter and angry feelings for the Earps. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, Ike escaped unharmed but their brother Billy was killed. Ike and Phin were accused of attempting to murder Virgil in December and assassinating Morgan Earp two months later, but Cowboy friends vouched for their presence in Contention, away.\n\nPhin had numerous other brushes with the law during his life. He and his brother Ike moved to northern Arizona near their sister and her husband, Eben Stanley. The three men developed a reputation for stealing livestock. The grand jury indicted them and Ike was killed while resisting arrest. Phin served one year and five months of his 10-year prison term. He married late in life and four years later died after contracting pneumonia.\n\n\"Phin\" or \"Fin\" was born in Callaway County, Missouri, to Newman Haynes Clanton and Mariah Sexton Kelso. Phin had six siblings: John Wesley, Joseph Issac, William Harrison, Alonzo Peter, Mary Elise and Ester Ann. The family moved frequently during his youth, from Missouri to Adams County, Illinois, in 1851 and then to Dallas, Texas, in 1853. The Clantons had repeated scrapes with the law. Both Newman and his oldest son John Wesley were convicted of desertion during the Civil War. They developed a reputation for theft and thuggery that followed them to Arizona. When Phin was 20, the family moved again to Fort Bowie, Arizona Territory and then the next year to San Buenaventura and after that to Port Hueneme, California. Phin’s mother Mariah died in 1866 while en route to California.\n\nIn 1869, at 24 years old, Phin was living in Lone Pine, California, with his oldest brother John Wesley Clanton and his wife Nancy.\n\nFour years later he returned to the Arizona Territory in 1873 to the Gila River valley to help his father Newman Haynes Clanton build up Clantonville, a farming community his father founded in Gila Valley, Arizona. His father purchased or squatted on a large tract of land outside Camp Thomas, but his plans for a new town failed to materialize. His father resumed cattle ranching and most of his children later followed him to Arizona.\n\nIn 1877, Phin moved with his father about south to land on the San Pedro River, about up river from Charleston, Arizona Territory. There he helped build a large adobe house which became the headquarters of the Clanton Ranch. Phin also obtained work as a freight driver. During the same time period, prospector Ed Schieffelin discovered silver in the hills east of the San Pedro River on a plateau known as Goose Flats, less than from the Clanton ranch. The family was very well situated to meet the demands for beef from the booming town of Tombstone. From its founding in March 1879, it grew from 100 residents to upwards of 15,000 citizens at its peak less than a decade later. When the mines built stamping mills on the San Pedro River about south of their ranch, a town named Charleston was built up to support them, providing the Clantons with another market for their beef.\n\nPhin's father was implicated in the First Skeleton Canyon Massacre in July 1881, and a month later \"Old Man\" Clanton was killed while driving a herd of stolen cattle through Guadalupe Canyon near the Mexican border. Old Man Clanton was buried where he died. In 1882 Phin and Ike exhumed their father's body and moved it to the Boot Hill cemetery in Tombstone. Newman Clanton was re-interred alongside his son Billy Clanton who had been killed in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.\n\nPhin's brother Billy was killed during the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone Police chief Virgil Earp, Assistant Marshal Morgan Earp, and temporary deputies Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, but they were exonerated after a contentious month-long preliminary hearing. Ike attempted to re-file murder charges in Contention, but his move was rejected for lack of new evidence. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and seriously wounded by hidden assailants. Virgil was left without use of his left arm. Phin and his brother Ike were both arrested for the attempted murder, but Cowboy friends bore witness that they had both been in Charleston, about away when the shooting took place, and they were released.\n\nWyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in Virgil's place. Wyatt deputized several men who guarded Virgil and his wife Allie on their way to Tucson and a train ride back to Colton, California, and their parent's home where he could recuperate in safety. In Tucson, Wyatt spotted Frank Stilwell lying in wait near the railroad tracks and killed him. Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul issued a warrant for their arrest. When Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan received the warrant, he assembled his own posse composed of friends of Frank Stilwell and Ike Clanton, including Phin, Pete Spence, Johnny Ringo, Johnny Barnes and about 18 more men. They rode after the federal posse and the five men wanted for Stilwell's murder. The Cochise County posse tracked Wyatt Earp's Federal posse as it was looking for the Cowboys who had attacked his brothers, seeking vengeance, but the two posses never met during the two-week-long pursuit.\n\nBehan's posse almost caught up with the Earp posse on the morning of March 27 at the Sierra Bonita ranch of Henry C. Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. When Behan's men were spotted in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles distant near Reilly Hill. When Sheriff Behan and his posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita ranch, Hooker refused them assistance. One report said Hooker told Behan where to look for the Earps but the posse left in the opposite direction.\n\nIn June 1882 Phin moved north to Springerville, Apache County, where his sister Mary Elsie lived with her husband Eben Stanley, a recipient of the Medal of Honor while fighting with the 5th U.S. Cavalry under General George Crook. Ike Clanton arrived in August. By 1885, both brothers had bought a quarter-section of land () 10 miles east of Springerville near the New Mexico border. Eben assisted Phin and Ike in getting their cattle business started.\n\nTwo years later, on December 27, 1885, the Apache County treasurer’s office was broken into. Deputy Treasurer Francisco Baca claimed that although the robbers were masked, he recognized the men as Phin and Ike Clanton, Eben Stanley and Lee Renfro of Springerville, and Mr. Buck Henderson of St. Johns. During the trial the court found that Baca had made up the story to cover his embezzling activities. He was later tried and convicted of stealing $11,166.54.\n\nStanley and the two Clanton brothers were suspected of stealing cattle from the Springerville area and taking them south via the Blue River to Clifton, Arizona, and other southern towns to sell. The \"Clanton-Stanley outfits\" were regarded as rustlers and had been a \"terror for years\". Apache County Sheriff Perry Owens and the local Stock Association decided to pursue indictments against them.\n\nOn March 1, 1887, George Powell testified before the grand jury implicating Ike, Phin, Eben, Charles Gray, Robert Gray, and Lee Renfro in livestock theft. An arrest warrant for Lee Renfro had already been issued on February 26 for the shooting death in November 1886 of Isaac Ellenger at Phin's Cienega Amarilla Ranch. Phin had allegedly given Renfro a horse to enable his escape. The grand jury returned 15 indictments the same day accusing Phin of grand larceny.\n\nPhin was arrested and jailed on April 30. During May more livestock were stolen and on May 14 deputies Albert Millet, George Powell and Detective Jonas V. Brighton left Springerville, Arizona to track down the stolen horses and mules. They followed the trail to \"Peg-leg\" Jim Wilson's ranch on Eagle Creek. They arrived on the evening of May 31 and spent the night. Early the next morning Ike Clanton rode up to the door on horseback. When the lawmen answered his knock, he immediately recognized them. He turned his horse to flee and withdrew his rifle from his scabbard. Detective Brighton shot Ike through the heart and he died before he hit the ground. On July 8 Renfro was found and was also killed while resisting arrest.\n\nIn September 1887 Phin was found guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in the Yuma Arizona State Prison. While serving his sentence, it was discovered that the prosecution’s primary witness that led to Phin’s conviction had lied on the stand so he could collect the $250 reward. On March 15, 1889, after serving only one year and five months, he was pardoned by Governor Meyer Zulick and was released on March 24, 1889.\n\nAfter his release, Phin and his friend Pete Spence began raising Angora goats on what is now the Bohme Allotment on Phin’s ranch in Globe, Arizona. In 1891, a Clifton newspaper mistakenly reported that Phin had been shot and killed by Ballard Peason at St. John.\n\nOn May 15, 1894, Phin Clanton was arrested by Sheriff John Henry Thompson for robbing Sam Kee, a Chinese gardener in Wheatfields, at gunpoint. Kee said Phin stole a gold watch valued at $40, two bars of silver bullion, each valued at $15, one gold bracelet valued at $20 and $320 in cash. Clanton was acquitted on May 22, 1894.\n\nOn October 15, 1902, at age 58, Clanton married 44-year-old Laura Jane (née Neal) Bound (or Bohme) in Globe, Arizona. She had a 12-year-old son from her first marriage to William Jackson.\n\nOn January 5, 1906, Phineas was involved in a wagon accident and his exposure to the cold weather led to a fatal case of pneumonia. He died at the age of 61 in Webster Springs and was buried in the Globe Cemetery.\n\nHis widow Laura Jane did wash at the mining company's guest house and took in boarders. Sixteen-year-old Will found work for a freight company driving mule teams that hauled ore from the Continental Mine to the Old Dominion. The wagon tracks are still visible in the rocks west of the Bohme Ranch on Webster Gulch. Every payday, Will bought another cow. He and Jane ran cattle on the range subsequently designated the Bohme Allotment by the U.S. Forest Service. Four years later Laura married Phin’s friend and business associate Pete Spence.\n"}

{"id": "3619682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3619682", "title": "Resident spy", "text": "Resident spy\n\nIn espionage, a resident spy is an agent operating within a foreign country for extended periods of time. A base of operations within a foreign country with which a resident spy may liaise is known as a \"station\" in English and a rezidentura (residency) in Russian parlance. What the U.S. would call a \"station chief\", the head spy, is known as a rezident in Russian.\n\nIn the former Soviet Union and Russian nomenclature, there are two types of resident spies: ' (, legal resident spy) and ' (, illegal resident spy). In U.S. parlance, the same distinction is between \"official cover\" and \"non-official cover\".\n\nA legal resident spy operates in a foreign country under official cover (such as from his country's embassy). He is an official member of the consular staff, such as a commercial, cultural, or military attaché. Thus, he has diplomatic immunity from prosecution and cannot be arrested by the host country if suspected of espionage. The most the host country can do is send him back to his home country as \"persona non grata\".\n\nAn illegal resident spy operates under non-official cover and so they cannot claim immunity from prosecution when arrested. They may operate under a false name and have documents making them out to be an actual national or from a different country from the one for which they are spying. Examples of such illegals include Rudolf Abel, who operated in the United States, and Gordon Lonsdale, who was born in Russia, claimed to be Canadian, and operated in Britain. Famous Soviet \"illegals\" include Richard Sorge, Walter Krivitsky, Alexander Ulanovsky, and Anna Chapman, who was also known as a sleeper agent.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of legal resident spies mostly mirror the disadvantages and advantages of illegal resident spies. A legal resident spy has the advantage of diplomatic status, but the disadvantage of being a known foreigner to the host country and one of just a few official diplomatic staff, whose intelligence status is thus easy for counterintelligence agencies to discern. On the other hand, an illegal resident spy has the advantage of being unknown as a foreigner to the host country and one amongst millions of the country's ordinary citizens but the disadvantage of not having diplomatic immunity to fall back upon.\n\nA legal resident spy has opportunities to meet high-level personnel of the host country as part of \"official\" business, and an illegal resident spy does not. However, conversely, illegal resident spies have easier access to a wide range of potential sources who would be put off by having to approach and deal with an openly foreign official and indeed need not even reveal to those people what country the spy actually works for.\n\nAlso, an illegal resident spy can stay in the host country when diplomatic relations break down, whereas legal resident spies are forced to leave with the diplomatic mission. A legal resident spy is easier to pay, since the salary can be openly incorporated into the diplomatic payroll, whereas making arrangements to pay illegal resident spies can be difficult, sometimes involving ruses that are more expensive and complex to administer than paying a diplomatic official would be, such as paying a host country organization or corporation to allow the illegal resident spy to pose as a member of its staff and be nominally paid by that organization/corporation.\n\nA legal resident spy has full and aboveboard access to embassy facilities for secure communications, meetings, and other services. An illegal resident spy has little to no access to such facilities, and communications arrangements are thus more difficult and time-consuming. An illegal resident spy will usually have a falsified biography, whereas a legal resident spy may suffer from having an official biography documenting their diplomatic career and providing useful clues to counterintelligence services about their intelligence activities and connections.\n\n"}

{"id": "1442763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1442763", "title": "Roman Vishniac", "text": "Roman Vishniac\n\nRoman Vishniac (; ; August 19, 1897 – January 22, 1990) was a Russian-American photographer, best known for capturing on film the culture of Jews in Central and Eastern Europe before the Holocaust. A major archive of his work now rests at the International Center of Photography.\n\nVishniac was a versatile photographer, an accomplished biologist, an art collector and teacher of art history. He also made significant scientific contributions to photomicroscopy and time-lapse photography. Vishniac was very interested in history, especially that of his ancestors, and strongly attached to his Jewish roots; he was a Zionist later in life.\n\nRoman Vishniac won international acclaim for his photos of \"shtetlach\" and Jewish ghettos, celebrity portraits, and microscopic biology. His book \"A Vanished World\", published in 1983, made him famous and is one of the most detailed pictorial documentations of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe in the 1930s. Vishniac was also remembered for his humanism and respect for life, sentiments that can be seen in all aspects of his work.\n\nIn August 2014, the International Center for Photography in New York City announced that 9,000 of Vishniac's photos, many never printed or published before, would be posted in an online database.\n\nVishniac was born in his grandparents' \"dacha\" outside Saint Petersburg, in the town of Pavlovsk, and grew up in Moscow. To live in this city was a right granted to few Jews but the Vishniac family lived there because Solomon Vishniac, Roman's father, was a wealthy manufacturer of umbrellas, and his mother, Manya, was the daughter of affluent diamond dealers. Vishniac also had a sister, Katja. During the summer months, the Vishniac family left Moscow, as it became uncomfortably hot, and they retreated to a \"dacha\" a few miles outside the city.\n\nAs a child, Vishniac was fascinated by biology and photography, and his room was filled with \"plants, insects, fish and small animals\". On his seventh birthday, he got a microscope from his grandmother, to which he promptly hooked up a camera, and by which he photographed the muscles in a cockroach's leg at 150 times magnification. Young Vishniac used this microscope extensively, viewing and photographing everything he could find, from dead insects to animal scales, to pollen and protozoa.\n\nUntil the age of ten, Vishniac was homeschooled; from ten to seventeen, he attended a private school at which he earned a gold medal for scholarship. Beginning in 1914, he spent six years at Shanyavsky Institute (now Russian State University for the Humanities) in Moscow. At the Institute he studied zoology. As a graduate student, he worked with prestigious biologist Nikolai Koltzoff, experimenting with inducing metamorphosis in axolotl, a species of aquatic salamander. While his experiments were a success, Vishniac was not able to publish a paper detailing his findings due to the chaos in Russia and his results were eventually independently duplicated. In spite of this, he went on to take a three-year course in medicine.\n\nIn 1918, Vishniac's immediate family moved to Berlin because of anti-Semitism spurred by uprisings against the Bolsheviks. Roman followed them and, shortly after arriving, married Luta (Leah) Bagg, who gave birth to two children, Mara and Wolf. In his free time, he studied Far Eastern Art at the University of Berlin. Vishniac researched endocrinology and optics, and did some photography (\"see right\"). In Berlin, he also initiated his public speaking career by joining the Salamander Club, at which he often gave lectures on naturalism.\n\nIn 1935, as anti-Semitism was growing in Germany, Vishniac was commissioned by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in Central Europe to photograph Jewish communities in Eastern Europe as part of a fund-raising drive to help support these poor communities. Vishniac developed and printed these pictures in his dark room in his Berlin apartment. Further trips to Eastern Europe were undertaken between 1935 and 1938, again at the behest of the JDC. Vishniac used both a Leica and a Rolleiflex camera in his photography. In 1939, his wife and children moved to Sweden to stay with Luta's parents, away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in Nice that summer.\n\nVishniac traveled to Paris in late summer 1940, and was arrested by Marshal Pétain's police and interned at Camp du Ruchard, a deportation camp in Indre-et-Loire. This occurred because Latvia, of which he was a citizen, had been subsumed into the Soviet Union and Vishniac was considered a \"stateless person\". After three months, as a result of his wife's efforts and aid from the JDC, he obtained a visa that allowed him to escape via Lisbon to the U.S. with his family. His father stayed behind and spent the war hidden in France; his mother died from cancer in 1941 while still in Nice.\n\nThe Vishniac family fled from Lisbon to New York City in 1940, arriving on New Year's Eve. Vishniac tried to get a job but failed: \"For me, it was a time of distraction and fear.\" He was multilingual, speaking at least German, Russian and Yiddish, but he could not yet speak any English and thus had a difficult time. He managed to do some portraiture work with mostly foreign clients; but business was poor. It was during this time, in 1942, that he took one of his most celebrated portraits, that of Albert Einstein. He arrived at Einstein's home in Princeton, New Jersey, getting into the scientist's study with the ruse of bringing regards from mutual friends in Europe, and photographed him while the scientist was not paying attention to him, occupied in thought. Einstein later called this portrait his favourite.\n\nIn 1946, Vishniac divorced Luta, and the next year he married Edith Ernst, an old family friend. A few years later, he gave up portraiture and went on to do freelance work in the field of photomicroscopy.\n\nOnce in the United States, Vishniac tried desperately to earn sympathy for impoverished Jews in Eastern Europe. When his work was exhibited at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1943, he wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt (First Lady at the time), asking her to visit the exhibit, but she did not. He also sent some of his photographs to the President, for which he was politely thanked.\n\nOf the 16,000 photographs taken in Eastern Europe by Vishniac, only 2,000 reached America. Most of these negatives were carefully hidden by Vishniac and his family; others were smuggled in by Vishniac's good friend Walter Bierer through Cuba. In the photographer's own words,\n\nEven when he grew older, Vishniac was very active. In 1957, he was appointed research associate at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and in 1961 was promoted to \"professor of biological education\". In his seventies and eighties, Vishniac became \"Chevron Professor of Creativity\" at Pratt Institute (where he taught courses on topics such as the philosophy of photography). During this time he lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with his wife Edith, teaching, photographing, reading and collecting artifacts. Items in his collection included a 14th-century Buddha, Chinese tapestries, Japanese swords, various antique microscopes, valued old maps and venerable books. He taught Oriental and Russian art, general philosophy and religion in science, specifically Jewish topics, ecology, numismatics, photography and general science at City University of New York, Case Western Reserve University and at various other institutions.\n\nDuring his life, Vishniac was the subject and creator of many films and documentaries; the most celebrated of which was the Living Biology series. This consisted of seven films on cell biology; organs and systems; embryology; evolution; genetics; ecology; botany; the animal world; and the microbial world. It was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.\n\nVishniac received Honorary Doctoral degrees from the Rhode Island School of Design, Columbia College of Art and the California College of Art, before his death from colon cancer on January 22, 1990.\n\nVishniac is best known for his dramatic photographs of poor and pious Jews in cities and \"shtetlach\" of Eastern Europe. He was commissioned to take these pictures by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) as part of a fundraising initiative, but Vishniac had a personal interest in this subject matter. He traveled back and forth from Berlin to the ghettos of Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Lithuania between 1935 and 1938 as well as working for the Committee.\n\nWhile touring Europe, Vishniac posed as a traveling fabric salesman, seeking aid where he could and bribing anyone who got in his way. During his touring of Eastern Europe (1935–1939), he was often arrested by police for taking these pictures, sometimes because he was thought to be spying. Later, when published, these photographs made him popular enough for his work to be showcased as one-man shows at Columbia University, the Jewish Museum in New York, the International Center of Photography and other such institutions.\n\nVishniac claimed that he had taken 16,000 photos in this period, every one a candid shot, but the veracity of these claims has been challenged by research by Maya Benton, a curator at the International Center of Photography. In order to photograph small villages in these mountains, Vishniac claimed he carried heavy equipment (Leica, Rolleiflex, movie camera, tripods), 115 pounds (52 kilograms) by his estimate, on his back, up steep roads, trekking many miles. Vishniac captured thousands of impoverished Jews on film, \"[...] to preserve — in pictures, at least — a world that might soon cease to exist\". \n\nWhen using a Leica for indoor shots, Vishniac sometimes brought a kerosene lamp (visible in some of his work) if there was insufficient light, keeping his back to a wall for support, and holding his breath. The Rolleiflex was used mostly for outdoor scenes.\n\nRoman Vishniac did not just want to preserve the memories of the Jews; he actively fought to increase awareness in the West of the worsening situation in Eastern Europe. \"Through his photographs, he sought to alert the rest of the world to the horrors [of the Nazi persecution]\", Mitgang. In late 1938, for example, he sneaked into Zbaszyn, an internment camp in Germany near the border, where Jews awaited deportment to Poland. After photographing the \"filthy barracks\", as he described it, for two days, he escaped by jumping from the second floor at night and creeping away, avoiding broken glass and barbed wire. These photos were sent to the League of Nations in Geneva to prove the existence such camps.\n\nAfter Vishniac's death, many photos came to light depicting life in Berlin taken between 1920 and 1939. Some of these negatives were found at the end of rolls of film devoted to scientific work. An exhibition of Vishniac's Berlin photos was mounted at the Jewish Museum, Berlin in 2005, and a book of the photos was published.\n\nVishniac's photographs from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished. His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic: \"There is barely a hint of a smile on any of the faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient casement windows and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners.\" Gene Thornton, writer for \"The New York Times\", called them \"somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter\".\n\nThese pictures, all in black and white, were done with available light or sometimes a lantern, yet they are \"amazingly crisp with surprising depth of field\". Indeed, \"There is a grainy realism to Vishniac's photographic style. We can almost finger the coarse textures of coats and shawls; the layers of fabric worn by the people seem more related to tree bark than to the well-pressed wool suit worn by an occasional elegant passerby.\" Vishniac is known to have exaggerated in composing the captions of his photographs, and in some cases he may have fabricated the stories behind them.\n\nVishniac's photographs from this period are widely commended and on permanent display in many museums. Edward Steichen places his pre-Holocaust photographs, \"among photography's finest documents of a time and place.\"'\n\nVishniac's photographs have had a profound effect on Holocaust literature and have illustrated many books about the Jewish ghettos and Holocaust. In the case of \"The Only Flowers of her Youth\", the drama of the photograph inspired Miriam Nerlove to write a novel based on the story of the girl in the picture.\n\nFor this work, Roman Vishniac has received the Memorial Award of the American Society of Magazine Photographers in 1956. He was also the winner of the visual arts category of awards of the Jewish Book Council in 1984; \"The Only Flowers of her Youth\" was deemed \"most impressive\" at the International Photographic Exhibition in Lucerne in 1952; and the Grand Prize for Art in Photography, New York Coliseum.\n\nIn 1955 Edward Steichen selected three of Vishniac's Eastern European photographs; of boys at a Cheder in Slonim (1938), of children and a woman in Lublin (1937), for the Museum of Modern Art world-touring The Family of Man exhibition that was seen by 9 million visitors, accompanied by a catalogue which has never been out of print.\n\nThere has been criticism of Vishniac's work, focusing on the lack of diversity of his subjects in his work from Eastern Europe and quality of his composition. It has been argued that he should have also photographed wealthier Jews, in addition to the poor Jews in ghettos. Thornton criticized his photographs for their unprofessional qualities, citing \"errors of focus and accidents of design, as when an unexplained third leg and foot protrudes from the long coat of a hurrying scholar.\"\n\nWhen photographic curator Maya Benton began to catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the International Center of Photography, she noticed that, in his book \"A Vanished World\", Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were not supported by the material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the opposite page a small boy points with his finger to his eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: \"The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935-1938.\" At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: \"The pogromshchiki\" (pogrom lynch mob) \"are coming. But the iron door was no protection.\" Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book \"almost certainly did not happen\".\n\nSimilarly, Benton discovered negatives that showed the unsmiling little girl depicted in \"The Only Flowers of her Youth\" – whom Vishniac had claimed did not own a pair of shoes – smiling and wearing shoes.\n\nMichael di Capua, who edited Vishniac's text for \"A Vanished World\", has said that he felt disquiet while compiling the text, since so much information was unsubstantiated. Benton also suggested that the terms of Vishniac's commission from the JDC – to photograph \"not the fullness of Eastern European Jewish life but its most needy, vulnerable corners for a fund-raising project\" – had led to his over-emphasizing poor, religious communities in \"A Vanished World\".\n\nIn addition to the candid photography for which he is best known, Vishniac worked heavily in the field of photomicroscopy, (specifically interference microscopy and cinemicroscopy). He specialized in photographing living insects and had a talent for arranging the moving specimens in \"just the right poses\", according to Philippe Halsman, former president of the American Society of Magazine Photographers. On the subject of Vishniac's skill in photomicroscopy, Halsman said he was, \"a special kind of genius\". He worked with all sorts of specimens, from protozoa, to fireflies to amino acids. Vishniac's work in photomicroscopy was, and is, highly regarded in the field. For three consecutive years, beginning in 1952, he won the Best-of-the-Show Award of the Biological Photographic Association in New York.\n\nOne of Roman Vishniac's most famous endeavors in the field of photomicroscopy was his revolutionary photographs from the inside of a firefly's eye, behind 4,600 tiny ommatidia, complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of Boston University of the circulating blood inside a hamster's cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy. His method of colorization, (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses polarized light to penetrate certain formations of cell structure and may greatly improve the detail of an image.\n\nIn the field of biology, Vishniac specialized in marine microbiology, the physiology of ciliates, circulatory systems in unicellular plants and endocrinology (from his work in Berlin) and metamorphosis. Despite his aptitude and accomplishments in the field, most of his work in biology was secondary to his photography: Vishniac studied the anatomy of an organism primarily to better photograph it. Besides experimenting with the metamorphosis of axolotl, he also researched the morphology of chromosomes in 1920: both in Berlin. As a biologist and philosopher in 1950, he hypothesized polyphyletic origin, a theory that life arose from multiple, independent biochemical reactions, spawning multicellular life. As a philosopher, he \"developed principles of rationalistic philosophy\" in the '50s.\n\nVishniac is notable for his photographs of insects mating, sea bass feasting and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures for hours in the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie for over an hour in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an extension tube. He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.\n\nVishniac's subjects varied throughout his life. At times, he would focus on documenting everyday life, as in Berlin, and later portraiture, doing famous portraits of Albert Einstein and Marc Chagall. He was also a pioneer in time-lapse photography, on which he worked from 1915 to 1918, and again later in life.\n\nRoman Vishniac always had strong ties with his ancestry, especially the Jewish aspect of it, \"From earliest childhood, my main interest was my ancestors\". He was a Zionist and a strong sympathizer with Jews who had suffered because of anti-Semitism, \"Oh yes, I could be a professor of anti-Semitism\", also stating then that he had one hundred and one relatives who died during the Holocaust. A famous photo of his (\"pictured right\") of a store in Berlin selling devices for separating Jews and non-Jews by skull shape was used by him to criticize the pseudoscience of German anti-Semites.\n\nVishniac associated much of his work with religion, though not specifically Judaism. \"Nature, God, or whatever you want to call the creator of the Universe comes through the microscope clearly and strongly,\" he remarked in his laboratory one day.\n\nLiving with the memory of hardship, Vishniac was, \"an absolute optimist filled with tragedy. His humanism is not just for Jews, but for every living thing.\" He probably believed in God or some similar concept, but he was non-denominational and did not adhere strictly to the principles of any religion. He even clashed with Orthodox Jews in one well-known instance: The religious Jews he met on his trek around Europe would not let themselves be photographed, quoting the Bible and its prohibition of making of graven images. Vishniac's famous response was, \"the Torah existed for thousands of years before the camera had been invented.\"\n\nVishniac was known for having great respect for all living creatures. Whenever possible, he returned a specimen to its precise home before it was captured and one time \"[lent] his bathtub to tadpoles for weeks until he could return them to their pond\". In accordance with this philosophy, he photographed almost exclusively living subjects.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Approximately 40% of Egyptians live in Upper Egypt, and \"80% of Egypt's poverty is concentrated in Upper Egypt\". Millions of upper Egyptians have migrated to Lower Egypt for work opportunities. The Sa'idi people are traditionally rural.\n\nThe word literally means \"from Ṣa‘īd\" (i.e. Upper Egypt), and can also refer to a form of music originating there, or to the dialect spoken by Sa'idis. The Arabic word \"Ṣa‘īd\", as a geographical term, means \"highland, upland, plateau\". The suffix \"-i\" denotes the adjective. The word \"Ṣa‘īdi\" is pronounced in the dialect itself as or and the plural is or , while pronounced in Egyptian Arabic (Northern Egyptian) as and the plural is .\n\nIn the Sahidic (Upper Egyptian) dialect of Coptic, the name for a person from Upper Egypt is (pronounced rem/rīs) meaning \"person of the South\" or (pronounced rem/pma/rīs or rem/ma/rīs) \"person of (the) place of the south (i.e. Upper Egypt)\" .\n\nṢa‘īdis and their dialect are the subject of numerous Egyptian Stereotypes and ethnic jokes mainly by the Upper Class Egyptians who owns business in Egypt's major cities and used to hire Upper Egyptian workers in Construction fields. They are popularly assumed to be rural simpletons, physically stronger and less clever than other Egyptians. An example of such stereotyping is the box office hit \"Ṣa‘īdi fil-Gama‘a al-Amrikiya\" (\"A Sa'idi in the American University\", i.e. the American University in Cairo) (1998) starring Mohamed Henedi., where he seemed less fashionable, less clever than the other Egyptian students of the AUC.\n\nThe majority of Upper Egyptians follow Sunni Islam though the region also has a significant Christian population and a rich Coptic Christian history. For instance, Sahidic was the leading Coptic dialect in the pre-Islamic period. In the last few decades the high proportion of Coptic Christians in Upper Egypt has enabled some Christians to hold prominent political posts there. For instance, Qena Governorate had a Coptic Christian governor in 2011.\n\n"}

Ashjian was born in Fresno, California; the oldest of eight children. After graduating from South Lake Tahoe High School in 1982, he started his own auto detailing company in Bakersfield, California, and grew it to include locations in Fresno, Bakersfield, and Visalia, California. He is a Latter-day Saint, and served on a mission for the LDS Church in Argentina from 1986 to 1988. Ashjian moved from California to Nevada in 1995. He resides in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he works as a businessman, paving contractor, and real estate investor, and is owner of an asphalt company. With his wife, Bonnie, he has two sons and one daughter.\n\nAshjian was a member of the Republican Party, and voted for the presidential candidacies of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and John McCain. In 2010, Ashjian and his supporters created the Tea Party of Nevada, whose values espouse small government, freedom, liberty, and decreasing the United States public debt. Ashjian filed his candidacy papers for the Tea Party, a registered minor party in Nevada, at Carson City on March 2, 2010. Ashjian's U.S. Senate candidacy was challenged in court in April 2010, and Carson City, Nevada district judge James Todd Russell ruled that he could stay on the ballot. This decision was appealed, and the Nevada Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision on October 6, 2010 that Ashjian would remain on the November 2010 ballot for U.S. Senate.\n\nIn media interviews, Ashjian emphasized his values included decreased power of government, and a strict interpretation of the United States Constitution. He identified with the views of politicians including Ronald Reagan, Sarah Palin, and Ron Paul. His political campaign was run as a grass-roots movement, and he served as his own communications director. He explained his decision to manage a minimalist and inexpensive campaign came from a desire to avoid a disconnect between politics and the people he wished to represent. Ashjian asserted he was confident his campaign would beat opponents from the two major political parties, Democrat Harry Reid and Republican Sharron Angle. In October 2010, Ashjian released an audio-tape to the media of a recorded conversation with Angle, in which she asked him to drop out of the U.S. Senate race. Angle told him she did not believe she could beat U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, if Ashjian remained on the ballot. Ashjian said he would stay in the race, and criticized both the major parties as inadequate choices in the election that would further the status quo. Harry Reid won the 2010 race and was reelected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nScott Ashjian was born in Fresno, California in 1964; the oldest of eight children. His grandfather, John M. Ashjian, worked in law enforcement and was appointed by the Board of County Supervisors of Bakersfield, California as Chief Probation Officer. Ashjian graduated from South Lake Tahoe High School in 1982, where he was a wrestler. As a teenager, Ashjian gained experience managing businesses. Ashjian started an auto detailing company in Bakersfield, California in 1982. He grew this business to include facilities in Fresno, Bakersfield and Visalia, California. Ashjian is a Latter-day Saint. He served a mission for the LDS Church in Argentina from 1986 to 1988. After completing his mission in Argentina, Ashjian returned to California and married his wife, Bonnie. Ashjian moved from California to Nevada in 1995. Ashjian and his wife have two sons and a daughter. His son Brogan served in 2010 on a religious mission in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Ashjian's daughter Bostyn participates in dance competition; his son Bronson wrestles in his high school. In 2010, Ashjian resided in Las Vegas, where he worked as a businessman and paving contractor. Ashjian is a real estate investor, and is the owner of an asphalt company, A&A Asphalt. He is involved with California based agricultural ventures.\n\nPrior to his political aspirations for the U.S. Senate, Ashjian was a member of the Republican Party, and voted for the presidential candidacies of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and John McCain. Ashjian filed his candidacy on March 2, 2010, and became the candidate of the Tea Party of Nevada for United States Senate in the 2010 Nevada general election. Early polling the week Ashjian filed his candidacy, showed him drawing double-digit support. Ashjian's candidacy is the only one which appears as the \"Tea Party\" on the November 2010 ballot. It is his first entrance into an election for political office. The Tea Party of Nevada qualified as a minor political party with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 27, 2010. Ashjian's supporters created the party, by successfully filing more than the 250 signatures needed. The Tea Party of Nevada's stated goals include striving to \"promote this nation's founding principles of freedom, liberty and a small representative government.\" The party stated in its preamble that both major political parties were responsible for a \"massive national debt\" in the United States, and that the \"great conservative majority in America\" should not believe that the Democrats and Republicans would support their views. In April 2010, Ashjian faced a legal challenge which attempted to remove his name from the ballot, as he had been a registered Republican shortly before he submitted his candidacy. Carson City, Nevada district judge James Todd Russell heard arguments on whether Ashjian could remain on the ballot starting on April 14. Judge Russell ultimately ruled that Ashjian complied with the intent of the law and he could remain on the ballot. The American Independent Party, which brought the suit against Ashjian, filed an appeal of the case to the Nevada Supreme Court. Ashjian commented on attempts to remove him from the ballot, \"They are doing the bidding for the Republican Party. They should welcome the ability of minor parties to field candidates when the two major political parties have failed us so badly.\" On October 6, 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling that Ashjian's candidacy would remain on the November 2010 ballot.\nDescribing his political views, Ashjian stated to the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" that he espouses Tea Party views including limiting the role of government, and a strict interpretation of the United States Constitution. Ashjian aligns himself with the conservative views of politicians Ronald Reagan, Ron Paul and Sarah Palin. He said in April 2010 that he was \"100 percent sure\" he would win the election and beat opponents Harry Reid and Sharron Angle in the November 2010 general election, \"by a large margin\". He explained that he filed to run for U.S. Senate, because individuals in Nevada who identified with Tea Party values had been \"duped by the Republican Party\". Ashjian noted, \"The GOP is trying to co-opt the Tea Party. That is one of the reasons I did what I did. I don't see a difference between Democrats and Republicans.\" Ashjian stated he did not think Sharron Angle would be able to win the U.S. Senate race against Harry Reid, and stated \"Republican attack committees are running the (national) Tea Party show.\" In May 2010 Ashjian asserted to the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\", \"I will pick up a large percentage of votes on both sides (Republican and Democrat) and those in the middle.\"\n\nAshjian's political campaign was structured as a grass-roots movement. The candidate served as his own communications director, and relied on his family and friends for assistance. His campaign website contained the declaration, \"I am running because I love my country and Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama are ruining it. It is time to take our country back and I am asking you to join me in this fight.\" Ashjian stated in an interview with the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\", \"I'm a frustrated patriot. I'm not a politician. I'm not savvy with radio and TV. But I believe I can make a change, and that's what I'm here for. I'm here to give people a third choice.\" When asked to characterize the Tea Party of Nevada, Ashjian responded, \"We're not Republican or Democrat. We won't fold into one party or the other. We're a tax-paying party that can make a difference and a party of normal people who want change. Bigger government and higher taxes is not working. Right now we're at a real crossroads to make change, and the bottom line is there's never been so much disdain for politicians.\" He explained why he chose to run a minimalist campaign, \"The political race is for the rich. Why would (politicians) want to spend X millions of dollars on a campaign? It has to be for political gain. That disconnect is why I'm running for office.\" Ashjian asserted that results for voters would be similar with both major party candidates as opposed to a third option, \"I'm here to say there is a choice. If you want to stick to the status quo, pick the Republicans or Democrats, but don't complain. Nobody can do a better job than I can.\" Regarding overtures from the Republican Party asking Ashjian to acquiesce to the two-party-system, Ashjian said, \"By them saying I should fall in line is an insult. I'm not asking for an invitation. I think they should get behind me, not fall in line like sheep. They're so paranoid, it makes me think they have weak candidates and they're afraid. The more they attack, the more they show their hand, and I mean that across party lines. It's not politics as usual. We're running a different campaign, and they're scared to death.\"\n\nIn October 2010, Ashjian released a tape to the media of a recorded conversation he had with Sharron Angle where she asked him to drop out of the race. In the tape, Angle says that she cannot defeat Harry Reid with Ashjian on the ballot. Ashjian commented about the meeting, in an interview with the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\", \"She asked that I support her, and I said, 'Why would I go and do that?'\". He stated he would never entertain the notion of dropping out of the race, \"She said, 'I can't win without you getting out of the race.' But I said I couldn't. I'm going to beat Harry Reid.\" He emphasized that he would not drop out of the race, \"I call the shots. ... I fought too hard to be on the ballot to get off.\" Ashjian remarked of the pressure involved in running for office, \"I've had personal threats against me and my family. I've had my phone tapped, and I've been followed.\" He commented that Angle was too close with the Republican Party, and therefore not a true outsider candidate. Ashjian sent a letter to Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller in October 2010, asking that party abbreviations on ballots be removed.\n\nOn October 28, 2010, a second ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court again affirmed Ashjian's ability to stand as a candidate in the 2010 Nevada election for U.S. Senate. In the case, the office of the Secretary of State of Nevada had asserted that the effort to appeal the case to the Nevada Supreme Court was without merit, because voters had already received absentee ballots and a removal of the candidate's entry would have the impact of therefore disenfranchising voters. In its unanimous decision, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled, \"(The) appellant's unexplained delay in prosecuting this appeal militates against disrupting the election process, which is already underway.\" One day before the U.S. Senate election, Ashjian received three percent in a survey from Public Policy Polling. Harry Reid won the race, and was reelected to the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n"}

He was the first protestor killed by shooting during the riots.\n\nSerhiy Nigoyan was born on August 2, 1993 to ethnic Armenians in village (south of Dnipropetrovsk) in Ukraine. Serhiy Nigoyan's parents are from the village Navur, in Armenia's northeastern province of Tavush, not far from the Azerbaijani border. They moved to Ukraine in the early 1990s, during the Nagorno-Karabakh War when their village was often attacked. Some relatives of Serhiy's father Gagik still live in Navur.\n\nSerhiy was an only child. He was born in Ukraine and never visited his ancestral land, yet loved his country. According to his father, on a wall next to Serhiy's bed hangs the flag of Armenia. Serhiy was attending the Armenian Church and knew the history of his people. His father also stated that Serhiy studied at the Dniprodzerzhynsk College of Physical Education, but after two years of study he ceased attending classes and in summer along with his father was visiting Crimea for seasonal work. Nigoyan was an amateur fighter in kyokushinkaikan karate and in the 2012 city championship in Dniprodzerzhynsk, he placed third.\n\nFilming the project \"There are people\" () to the 200th Anniversary of Shevchenko, producer Serhiy Proskrunia managed to record video footage of Nigoyan reading a fragment of Shevchenko's poem \"Caucasus\".\n\nHe died early in the morning of January 22, 2014 at around 06.30 after being mortally wounded. Soon after, at around 08.10, Berkut violently charged protesters on Hrushevskoho street, near the Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium.\n\nOn January 23, Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine issued a statement stating that death of two activists (Nigoyan, and Belorussian Mikhail Zhyznewsky) resulted from wounds inflicted by a firearm using a lead case shot, and a hunting rifle. The Ministry claimed that such firearms are not in use by the Ukrainian police, and, moreover, that officers dispersing the protest were not issued with any standard firearms either. The ministry also noted presence of many protesters with firearms in videos made at the area. One of estimated reasons was provocation for conflict escalation.\n\nOn January 23, 2014 the Televised News Service (TSN) showed a footage with interview of Nigoyan filmed on January 19 by the TSN's cameraman. On a question why he came to Euromaidan, Nigoyan stated that he did so in protest against beating of students by Berkut militsiya. While proud to be an Armenian, Nigoyan wanted to express his support for people among which he was born and with which he lived.\n\nOn January 26, 2014 Nigoyan was buried in his native village Bereznuvativka. His funeral was attended by local villagers, representative of the Armenian diaspora, priests from Armenian and Ukrainian Churches. His requiem was served by the head of Ukrainian Eparchy of the Armenian Apostolic Church Archbishop Grigoris Buniatyan.\n\nOn January 22, 2015 the General Prosecutor of Ukraine Vitaly Yarema claimed that smoothbore guns were used for murder, but there are documented facts police used hunting ammo to kill those (Nigoyan and Zhiznevsky) heroes.\n\nOn November 18, 2015 according to the head of the Special Investigations Unit of the Main Investigation Department of the Prosecutor General Sergei Gorbatyuk, Serhiy Nigoyan and Mikhail Zhiznevsky were killed at a distance of not less than three meters, while the law enforcement agencies of the protesters were at a distance of about 30 meters. The killers could be provocateurs or masked police workers.\n\nHis friends from Maidan suppose he was chosen for murder because of his appearance, activity, and popularity among the media.\n\nOn 26 January 2017 The General Procuror Office of Ukraine stated that the murder of Nigoyan and Zhiznevsky was not properly investigated and is considered to be unfinished. The victims could have been shot from distance of no less than 30 meters and may include some law enforcement officers.\n\nOn January 22, 2014 in his Twitter Svyatoslav Vakarchuk mentioned that \"another Armenian, Parajanov created the film (Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors) that became symbol for all Ukrainians, today Armenian Nigoyan sacrificed his life that became a symbol of Ukraine\".\n\nValentyn Sylvestrov (b. 1937), a renowned Ukrainian composer, dedicated a memorial diptych to Serhiy Nigoyan. The new pieces use lyrics by Taras Shevchenko which Nigoyan had quoted, and the traditional liturgical text \"With the saints give rest\".\n\nOn February 20, 2014 a group of Armenian opposition activists in Spitak attempted to rename a square in the town from the Viktor Yanukovych Square to the Serhiy Nigoyan Square.\n\nOn March 27, 2014 the Berezhany city council adopted a decision to rename the city street named after the Soviet writer Yaroslav Halan as Nigoyan street.\n\nOn 22 February 2018 the Dnipro (formally Dnipropetrovsk) City Council renamed the Kalinin avenue to Prospekt Serhiy Nigoyan. In June 2017 the Dnipro Administrative Court of Appeal had abolished the January 2015 decision of the city council to rename the Kalinin avenue to Prospekt Serhiy Nigoyan.\n\n"}

He served as a secretary in the Politische Abteilung at Auschwitz concentration camp beginning in June 1940, where he participated in mass murders using the \"Genickschuss\" method of firing one bullet into the back of the neck, established by SS-Untersturmführer Ernst Grabner.\n\nQuakernack worked as a team leader in the crematorium at Auschwitz and participated in the gassing of Soviet POWs at the end of 1941. In September 1942, he was promoted to Oberscharführer and awarded the \"Kriegsverdienstkreuz\" (War Merit Cross), in September 1943. He was further promoted camp commandant in April 1944 at \"Arbeitslager\" Laurahütte, a subcamp of Auschwitz in Siemianowice Śląskie. He also worked at Auschwitz III, known as Monowitz. During his time in Auschwitz, he was known to personally kill prisoners in the following way: the prisoners were led to a big warehouse, Quackernack would then also enter under the influence of alcohol with an MP-40 machine pistol and fire at the prisoners continuously to the moment when they were all dead. Former member of Sonderkommando unit, tasked to get the bodies on trucks and take them to crematorium recalled, that Quackernack was staying in the middle of the warehouse, surrounded by dead bodies, holding an overheated gun, with his uniform entirely red from blood laughing loudly.
