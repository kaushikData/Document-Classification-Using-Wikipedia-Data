Her parents hailed from a Fula family. She attended the highest education facility, the École Normale Supérieure in Bamako, along with her future husband, Alpha Oumar Konaré. They married on 15 September 1971. Her new husband was employed as a high school teacher but he was to be sent to the University of Warsaw to undertake doctoral research. They both obtained a PhD in History in 1976. She returned to Mali and became a history professor at her alma mata in Bamako.\n\nKonaré and her spouse worked together on several projects. They published a book together in 1983 called \"Grande Dates Du Mali\" and they both worked for the democratic cause under the presidency of Moussa Traore who ruled Mali's single party state until 1991. During that time they created a publishing house \"Jamana\" and a daily newspaper \"Les Echos\" and a political party called ADEMA-PAS.

Smith departed soon after, and Hunt continued to play under his successor Ossie Ardiles.\n\nHowever, this was not a successful time for the Magpies, who had fallen into the Second Division in 1989 and failed to make even the playoffs in the 1990-91 season.

She has established a career in Hindi films, and is one of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India. She is the recipient of several awards, including one Filmfare Award from seven nominations.\n\nBorn in Ayodhya and raised in Bangalore, Sharma had her first modelling assignment for the fashion designer Wendell Rodricks in 2007 and later moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career as a model. She made her acting debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the highly successful romantic film \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\" (2008), which earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. She rose to prominence with starring roles in Yash Raj Films' romances \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" (2010) and \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" (2012); the latter, in which she played an aspiring filmmaker, won her a Best Supporting Actress award at Filmfare.\n\nSharma went on to earn praise and several acting nominations for playing an avenger in the 2015 crime thriller \"NH10\", which also marked her production debut, a dancer in the 2015 comedy-drama \"Dil Dhadakne Do\", and a free-spirited woman in the 2016 romantic drama \"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\". Sharma's highest-grossing releases came with the sports drama \"Sultan\" (2016), and Rajkumar Hirani's religious satire \"PK\" (2014) and biopic \"Sanju\" (2018); all three rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Sharma is the ambassador for multiple brands and products and has designed her own line of clothing for women, named Nush. She supports various charities and causes, including gender equality and animal rights, and is the co-founder of the production company Clean Slate Films. Sharma is married to the cricketer Virat Kohli.\n\nAnushka Sharma was born on 1 May 1988 in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. Her father, Colonel Ajay Kumar Sharma, is an army officer, and her mother, Ashima Sharma, is a homemaker. Her father is a native of Uttar Pradesh, while her mother is a Garhwali. Her elder brother is film producer Karnesh Sharma, who earlier served in the Merchant Navy. Sharma has stated that being a military brat played an important role in shaping her as a person and contributing to her life. In an interview with \"The Times of India\" in 2012, she said, \"I take pride in saying that I am an army officer's daughter even more than being an actor.\"\n\nSharma was raised in Bangalore. She was educated at the Army School there, and received a degree in arts from Mount Carmel College. She originally intended to pursue a career in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress. After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career. She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa. In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection. Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio. Sharma later said, \"I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp and smile and they used to say, ‘give us a blank look.’ It was really difficult, not to smile\". Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles.\n\nSharma made her acting debut in Aditya Chopra's romantic drama \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\" (2008), opposite Shah Rukh Khan. She took a day to prepare for her screen test at the Yash Raj Films studio and refused to do an impromptu one. She was signed for a three-film deal with the company and landed the leading role of Tani Sahni, a young bride to a middle-aged man, portrayed by Khan. Khalid Mohamed of \"Hindustan Times\" found her to be \"assured and upright\" in the film, but Nikhat Kazmi thought that she \"lacks all chutzpah and can barely hold your attention\". The film was a major commercial success, emerging as the second-highest grossing Hindi film of that year, and earned Sharma Filmfare Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Female Debut. Two years later, Sharma played the leading lady in the crime-comedy \"Badmaash Company\", directed by Parmeet Sethi and co-starring Shahid Kapoor, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film, which tells the story of four underachieving friends who begin a scam business enterprise, received mixed reviews.\n\nLater in 2010, Sharma completed her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films by starring in \"Band Baaja Baaraat\", a romantic comedy directed by Maneesh Sharma and co-starring debutant Ranveer Singh. Her role was that of Shruti Kakkar, an ambitious middle-class Punjabi girl who starts her own wedding planning business. In preparation for the part, Sharma learned to speak in the Punjabi dialect, which she cited as the toughest part of her role; she described the way the lead characters in the film interact as \"crude but cute\" and it required her to \"talk fast, sometimes mix words and even omit words completely\". Trade analysts expressed doubt on \"Band Baaja Baaraat\"s financial prospect, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star, and saying that by then Sharma was an \"almost-forgotten\" actress. However, \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" earned positive reviews and emerged as a sleeper hit. Sharma's performance was praised by critics, many of whom cited it as her best work to that point. The critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Sharma \"comes into her own as the ambitious Delhi girl, who dreams of upgrading to multi-crore Sainik Farms weddings\". For her work in the film, Sharma received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.\nSharma's first venture not to be produced by Yash Raj Films was the drama \"Patiala House\" (2011) directed by Nikhil Advani and co-starring Akshay Kumar. The film tells the story of a budding cricketer (played by Kumar) who encounters trouble in convincing his father of his profession; Sharma was cast as the love interest of Kumar's character. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised Sharma's work and labelled her a \"metaphor for energy\". That same year, she re-united with co-star Ranveer Singh and director Maneesh Sharma for the comedy-drama \"Ladies vs Ricky Bahl\". She featured as Ishika Desai, a salesgirl hired to outwit a conman (essayed by Singh), who ends up falling in love with him instead. The film and Sharma's performance received mixed reviews, with Piyali Dasgupta of NDTV calling her \"believable but not endearing\". Despite mixed reviews, the film was a moderate success at the box office.\n\nIn 2012, Sharma played a supporting role alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif in Yash Chopra's \"swan song\", the romance \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\", which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films and her second with Khan. She was cast as Akira Rai, a Discovery Channel reporter who harbours ambitions of being a documentary filmmaker. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand wrote that Sharma \"brings a spark to the film\", but Raja Sen disagreed and said that \"while Anushka can indeed play spunky, she needed here to tone it down several notches\". For her role, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" proved to be the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2012.\n\nSharma next appeared in Vishal Bhardwaj's \"Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola\" (2013), a political satire set in a village in Haryana. Co-starring alongside Pankaj Kapur, Imran Khan and Shabana Azmi, Sharma played the titular role of Bijlee Mandola, a strong-headed girl who engages in a romantic affair with Khan's character despite being engaged to another man. The film received positive to mixed reviews from critics, and underperformed at the box office. Several critics noted that Sharma was being stereotyped as a loud and loquacious girl; Raja Sen noted that she \"is great in a couple of scenes near the climax,\" though Kanika Sikka of \"Daily News and Analysis\" was more critical and found her \"unconvincing\".\n\nIn 2014, Sharma portrayed Jagat \"Jaggu\" Janini, a television journalist who befriends an alien (played by Aamir Khan), in Rajkumar Hirani's religious satire \"PK\". Critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote that Sharma plays \"a feisty poetry-loving girl who knows her mind far more than most Hindi film heroines are allowed to\" and praised her for \"hold[ing] her own\" against Khan. The film garnered critical acclaim and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film with a worldwide revenue of over . Sharma launched a production company named Clean Slate Films, whose first release was Navdeep Singh's thriller \"NH10\" (2015), in which she also played the lead role. Screened at the 5th Beijing International Film Festival, the film tells the story of a married couple whose lives are endangered after an encounter with a group of criminals. In preparation, Sharma underwent interval training for three months to build her stamina. Writing for NDTV, critic Saibal Chatterjee found the film to be a \"taut and riveting thriller\" and praised Sharma for \"conveying a range of moods as she moves from the vulnerable to the fearless in a battle in which the odds are stacked heavily against her\", and Prarthana Sarkar of \"International Business Times\" credited her for breaking away from her romantic comedy image. The film also emerged as a box office success.\n\nIn Anurag Kashyap's period crime drama \"Bombay Velvet\" (2015), (based on the historian Gyan Prakash's book \"Mumbai Fables\") co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar, Sharma was cast in the role of a jazz singer, Rosie Noronha. Her character was referenced from yesteryear stars like Brigitte Bardot, Helen and Waheeda Rehman. To prepare, Sharma watched films of the 1950s and 1960s, and documentaries about evolution in hair and make-up. She also used temporary lip enhancers for the part, citing it as the reason behind her changed appearance on a chat show in 2014, and refuted media speculation about having undergone plastic surgery. \"Bombay Velvet\" was screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals, but critical reviews on it were mixed. Writing for \"Business Standard\", Ritika Bhatia praised Sharma's performance in the song \"Dhadaam Dhadaam\": \"she fills the stage with such raw emotion that her mascara-laden tears and fake eyelashes flutter with arresting passion\". However, the film failed to recoup its investment.\n\nAlso in 2015, Sharma featured in the supporting role of a dancer aboard a cruise ship in Zoya Akhtar's \"Dil Dhadakne Do\", an ensemble comedy-drama starring Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra and Ranveer Singh. The song sequence \"Pehli Baar\" was choreographed by her and Singh; Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters praised their on-screen chemistry and described it as \"crackling\". Her performances in \"NH10\" and \"Dil Dhadakne Do\" earned Sharma Filmfare Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.\n\nSharma next reunited with Yash Raj Films in \"Sultan\" (2016), a romantic sports drama from the writer-director Ali Abbas Zafar. She took on the role of Aarfa Hussain, a wrestler from Haryana who inspires the title character (played by Salman Khan) to take up the sport. Sharma was initially hesitant to play the part as she did not have the physique of a wrestler; she researched on different weight categories to \"beat people’s perception that all wrestlers are huge.\" She trained for six weeks in the sport, learned to speak the Haryanvi dialect, and interacted with female wrestlers from the state. The film and her performance received mixed reviews. Critics were appreciative of her substantial role in an androcentric film; \"Filmfare\"s Rachit Gupta described Sharma as \"the best thing in the film\" and noted that [e]ven though she doesn't have the physique of a wrestler, her spirited performance makes you believe in her tough but emotional character.\" However, Suprateek Chatterjee of \"The Huffington Post\" felt that she was unconvincing as a wrestler, writing that \"she possesses literally zero muscles and somehow always finds the time to get her make-up just right.” With earnings of over worldwide, \"Sultan\" ranks among Indian cinema's biggest grossers.\n\nSharma achieved further success later that year when she played the lead female role of Alizeh Khan, a free-spirited girl in a loveless relationship in Karan Johar's romantic drama \"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\", alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai. Mike Maccahil of \"The Guardian\" took note of how much Sharma \"terrific spikiness\" and her chemistry with Kapoor helped a mediocre picture. In another typical mixed review, Sweta Kaushal of \"Hindustan Times\" praised Sharma's empowered female lead. The film earned over worldwide, and Sharma received a Best Actress nomination at the 62nd Filmfare Awards. With two top-grossing films in 2016, Bollywood Hungama ranked Sharma as the most successful Bollywood actress of the year.\n\nThe 2017 fantasy comedy \"Phillauri\", co-starring Suraj Sharma and Diljit Dosanjh, featured Sharma as a friendly ghost who wants to reunite with her lover. In addition to acting and producing, Sharma also sang a song for the film. She next collaborated with Shah Rukh Khan for the third time in Imtiaz Ali's \"Jab Harry Met Sejal\", a romance about a Gujrati tourist (Sharma) in Europe who falls in love with her tour guide. Commenting on Sharma's performances in \"Phillauri\" and \"Jab Harry Met Sejal\", Uday Bhatia of \"Mint\" praised her ability for \"straight-faced com[edy]\". Bhatia, however, criticised her pairing with Khan, 22 years her senior, in the latter film. Unlike her 2016 releases, both these films were box office flops.\n\nSharma's first film release of 2018 was the supernatural horror film \"Pari\", which she starred in and produced. It tells the story of Rukhsana (Sharma), a battered young woman living in the wilderness, who is rescued by a benevolent man (played by Parambrata Chatterjee). Anna M. M. Vetticad of \"Firstpost\" commended Sharma for \"the risk-taking streak she has brought to her career so far\" and praised her for delivering an \"image-defying performance that is designed to elicit pity and dread in equal measure\", but Shubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\" wrote that the \"film is so poorly-written, and so scatter-brained that nothing can rescue it, not even a leading lady who is determined to do something different with her producing heft\". It earned over worldwide against a production budget of . Sharma next played the role of a biographer documenting the life of the troubled actor Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's biopic \"Sanju\", starring Ranbir Kapoor in the title role. Rajeev Masand commended the film's ensemble but was critical of Sharma's performance, writing that she \"sticks out with strange hair and stranger accent\". Even so, it emerged as her third release to earn over worldwide.\n\nIn the same year, Sharma teamed with Yash Raj Films for the eighth time in \"Sui Dhaaga\", a comedy-drama co-starring Varun Dhawan, about a poor, young couple who begin their own small-scale clothing industry. Ronak Kotecha of \"The Times of India\" praised the subtle chemistry between the leads and credited Sharma for playing the restrained role effortlessly. Sharma's final film appearance of the year will be in \"Zero\", a romantic drama about a dwarf, which reunites her with Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif. In it, she plays the role of a scientist suffering from cerebral palsy. She will next produce two projects for streaming television, an as-yet untitled cop drama series for Amazon Video and a period drama film entitled \"Bulbul\" for Netflix.\n\nAs of September 2014, Sharma is pursuing a Master of Economics degree through correspondence. She started practising vegetarianism in 2015. \"The Times of India\" has listed her as one of \"Bollywood's hottest vegetarian celebrities\". She was also named as the \"hottest vegetarian of 2015\" by PETA. She is an avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation. Sharma has confessed to being a victim of anxiety disorder and seeking treatment for it.\n\nA practicing Hindu, Sharma along with her family is a follower of Anant Dham Atmabodh Ashram in Haridwar. The ashram is headed by Maharaj Anant Baba, who is her family's spiritual guru and the actress is a regular visitor to the ashram. Sharma's romantic relationship with the cricketer Virat Kohli has attracted substantial media coverage in India, though she has been reluctant to publicly talk about it. The couple married in Italy on 11 December 2017.\n\nIn September 2013, Sharma participated and walked the ramp in a fashion show that was held in memory of the late filmmaker, Yash Chopra. She participated in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Indian Premier League held at Kolkata, along with other celebrities including Hrithik Roshan, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Farhan Akhtar and composer Pritam.\nApart from acting, Sharma supports a number of charities and causes. She walked the ramp to support Shabana Azmi's Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO that helps empower women. In 2013, alongside other Bollywood actors, she pledged to support the education of India's young girls as part of NDTV's \"Our Girls, Our Pride\" fundraiser. That same year, she appeared alongside other celebrities in a commercial, produced by the National Film Development Corporation of India, to create awareness about the 'Right to Education' for children. In December 2014, Sharma auctioned the leather jacket she wore in \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\" on eBay, with proceeds going to the redevelopment of the flood-ravaged states of Kashmir and Assam. Sharma had also fronted a campaign to collect donations for the victims of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. She supports the annual Mumbai Film Festival, and donated money in its cause in 2015. Sharma has been vocal about the disparity in the pay that actresses command, in comparison with their male counterparts in the film industry. In 2016, she supported India's first transgender band, the 6-Pack Band (initiated by Y-Films), by providing a voice over in their first single, \"Hum Hain Happy.\"\n\nSharma has also spoken up for animal rights on social media. In April 2014, she took to Twitter to ask for a ban on horse-drawn carriages in Mumbai. In June 2015, she condemned the Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China, and urged her fans to sign an online petition aimed at stopping it. In October 2015, she launched 'Pawsitivity', a campaign aimed at sensitising people about the adverse effects of noise, air, water and soil pollution on animals. In October 2017, Sharma launched her own clothing line, named Nush.\n\nPriya Gupta of \"The Times of India\" has said that \"the best part of [Sharma's] stardom is that she does not have the trappings of a star.\" Kalpana Nair of \"Firstpost\" stated: \"actresses like Sharma command the respect they do in a largely conservative and male-dominated industry and the fact that their fan base grows when they take on roles that are not conventional is good reason for us to beam widely and walk with a spring in our step\". Samar Srivastava, writing for \"Forbes\", called her \"unafraid\", and added: \"you would be hard-pressed to associate Sharma with the stereotype of a mainstream leading lady.\" \"The Times of India\" published that \"..she never shies away from putting [her opinion] across.\"\n\nSharma featured on Rediff.com's list of \"Bollywood's Best Actors\" for \"Band Baaja Baaraat\" (2010), and \"NH10\" (2015). She was also featured in their list of \"Bollywood's Best Dressed Actresses\" in 2012–13. She held the fifth position on \"The Times of India's\" listing of the \"Most Desirable Woman\" in 2011. In 2012, she appeared in the \"Forbes\" Celebrity 100, a list based on income and popularity of India's celebrities. She remained in the top fifty spots for three consecutive years, listed at the thirty-sixth spot in 2012, the thirty-first spot in 2013, and the forty-second spot in 2014. In 2015, she was ranked nineteenth with an estimated annual earning of , making her one of the highest-paid actresses in the country.

{"id": "8351175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8351175", "title": "Bharatchandra Ray", "text": "Bharatchandra Ray\n\nBharatchandra Ray Gunakor (; 1712–1760) was an 18th-century Bengali and Sanskrit poet and song composer. He is mostly known for his poetic work, \"Annadamangal\" or \"Annapurnamangal\". He is often referred to simply as Bharatchandra. Maharaja Krishnachandra of Nadia conferred him with the title Gunakor, after which he became famous as Ray Gunakor Bharatchandra.\n\nBharatchandra was born to Narendranarayan Ray and Bhavani Devi in Penro-Bhurshut village (in the present-day Howrah district) which is currently near Amta, Howrah area. He was youngest of the four children. His father entered a property dispute with the Raja of Bardhaman, and in the process disrespected Raja Kirti Chandra Ray's mother Rani Bishnukumari. As a result, they took away all his lands. A penniless Narendranarayan fled away, while Bharatchandra was taken to his maternal uncle's home in Naoapara. While staying there he learned Sanskrit at the nearby village of Tajpur. When he was 14 he mastered the language and married the daughter of Narottam Acharya of nearby Sarada village.\n\nOn returning home his elder brothers mocked him for learning Sanskrit as they thought the language would be of no use for them. Bharatchandra felt bad and left home for West Debanandpur, a village in Bashberia area of Hooghly district. There, while living in Ramchandra Munshi's house, he mastered Persian. After his education, he worked as a Mokhtar to facilitate his paternal household's property management. He had to leave his ancestral home because of property disputes and marriage of his own choice. He roamed from place to place. He passed some time in Cuttack, Orissa in the domain of the Maratha power. Later he went back to Bengal.\n\nWhen Bharatchandra was residing in the house of Indranarayan Chaudhury, the Diwan of the French government at Chandernagore, his talent was noticed by Maharaja Krishnachandra of Krishnanagar and Bharatchandra became his court poet. He was bestowed with the title Raygunakar and received huge amount of land in Mulajore from Krishnachandra. He was the first poet in the Bengali language to be identified as a people’s poet, and lent a new grace and beauty to the language.\n\nThe most notable work of Bharatchandra is \"Annada Mangal\" or \"Annapurnamangal\". This work, completed in 1752, is divided into three parts. The first part, which eulogises the goddess Annapurna is known as \"Annadamangal\". The second part, which narrates the story of Vidya and Sundar is known as \"Kalikamangal\" and the third and the final part, which narrates the story of Man Singh I and Bhavananda Majumdar is known as \"Annapurnamangal\". His another work, \"Rasamanjari\" is a Bengali-language adaptation of a Maithili work of the same name written by Bhanudatta. \"Nagashtaka\", a bi-lingual poetic work in Sanskrit and Bengali, shows his mastery over Sanskrit metres. His other notable works include: \"Gangashtaka\" in Sanskrit, \"Satyanarayan Panchali\" and an incomplete work, \"Chandi Natak\".\n\nBharatchandra was the true representative of the transition of Bengali music from medieval to modern age. He was well versed in classical music, a skill he possibly acquired in the court of the Maharaja Krishnachandra. While he adopted the line of \"mangalgan\" (song of bliss) which was traditionally dedicated to the gods and goddesses, he attempted to liberate the poetical as well as musical compositions of Bengal from the hold of gods and goddesses and infused a human touch into them. Many of the songs he composed as part of long poetic works were on their own lyrical and could be sung independently. Bharatchandra may also be regarded as a pioneer in composing songs on Radha-Krishna love theme in raga musical form outside the area of \"padavali kirtan\". In a way he is considered the forerunner of Ramprasad Sen and Ramnidhi Gupta (popular as Nidhu Babu).\n\nGerasim Lebedev translated a portion of Bharatchandra's \"Annadamangal\" into Russian. He also borrowed from the lyrics composed by Bharatchandra for the musical composition of the two translated plays he stage in Kolkata.\n"}

Thomas served as a Republican member of the Alaska House of Representatives from the 5th District, comprising scattered rural and semi-rural communities throughout Southeast Alaska and stretching westward to Prince William Sound, from 2005 to 2013. Thomas served in the majority his entire tenure in the House and held multiple chairmanships. Thomas gained a seat on the powerful House Finance Committee during his second term and would eventually co-chair the committee. Following redistricting, Thomas lost reelection in 2012 by 32 votes to 23-year-old Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins, a political newcomer who left Yale University to run.\n\nWilliam A. Thomas Jr. was born in Haines, Territory of Alaska on June 1, 1947, and is a lifelong resident of Haines and the surrounding Chilkat Valley. He is descended from the Tlingit Natives of nearby Klukwan village. Speaking before a Native organization in Juneau about his origins, Thomas once explained \"And the Thomas? That came from California\".\n\nBill Thomas graduated from Haines High School in 1965. Shortly thereafter, he briefly attended the University of Alaska before joining the U.S. Army, where he served for two years during the Vietnam War.\n\nBill Thomas began commercial fishing for a living ca. 1970, and has continued in this line of work ever since. He has mostly run gillnets and longlines.\n\nThomas has also served as chairman and CEO of his village's Native corporate, Klukwan, Inc. This position has led to Thomas serving on the board of directors of a number of the corporation's subsidiaries.\n\nBill Thomas began working as a lobbyist in Juneau ca. 1991, mostly representing small community concerns throughout Southeast Alaska. He also spent four years apiece on the Haines Borough assembly (legislative body) and school board.\n\nIn 2004, Democrat Georgianna Lincoln, who represented the sprawling, rural District C in the Alaska Senate (Lincoln hailed from the Yukon River village of Rampart), did not seek reelection. 5th District member of the Alaska House of Representatives, Albert Kookesh, filed to run for the Senate, eventually winning. Thomas ran for the 5th District House seat, citing his experience as a lobbyist as being beneficial to the position. Thomas won election in 2004 by 59 votes over Tim June, a fellow commercial fisherman from Haines, who was active in environmental and watershed issues for many years. Thomas would be reelected mostly easily thereafter, including defeating June by an approximately 61 to 38 percent margin in 2008.\n\nIn the 24th Alaska State Legislature, Thomas served as co-chair of the House Community and Regional Affairs Committee, as well as co-chair of the Fisheries Committee. He also served on the Education, Military and Veterans' Affairs and the Transportation Committees in the House.\nsince 2004. He served as Co-Chair of the Finance Committee and was a member of the Legislative Budget & Audit Committee. He also chaired the Governor and the Legislature Finance Subcommittees for the 27th Legislature.\n\nDue to an Alaskan Supreme Court order, the redistricting board has redrawn the district lines for the 2012 election based on state constitutional requirements. Major changes have been proposed to the Southeast region, including Thomas's district. The proposed plan combines the 5th District with Juneau, the state capital directly to the south. Constituents from Haines Borough have objected to the new map, town mayor Stephanie Scott stated \"we do not believe that we are socio-economically integrated with the Mendenhall Valley, we don't have the same concerns, the same needs.\" Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins of Sitka was the Democratic challenger to Thomas.\n\nKreiss-Tomkins subsequently defeated Thomas by 32 votes, following a recount. As ballot-counting continued beyond election day, the lead went back and forth, even tying at one point.\nBill Thomas and his wife, Joyce Marie, have five children: Rhett, Danny, Gabriel, Cole and Rhiannon.\n\n"}

In one such article he had underlined the need to hold Constituent Assembly elections, long before the peace process was initiated as he had already smelt the root cause of the Maoist insurgency. In fact, he was not only an efficient administrator and honest civil servant, but also a person with diverse personality and high-vision.\n\nShah steered the Election Commission so perfectly that facilitated Nepal to hold Parliamentary as well as local level elections on the basis of the principle of adult-franchise to the satisfaction of all the political parties and the mission of the Peoples Movement I.\nBorn in Maidi VDC Ward No. 2, Dhading district on 29 August 1937 to father Captain Lal Jung Shah and mother Subhadra Kumari. Shah was married to Ishwori Shah in 1971 B.S. and is survived by son Bimal Pratap Shah and daughter Binita Shah (Khadka)and grandchildren Sivashish Pratap Shah and Biraj Khadka. Shah died on 29 April 2005.\n\nShah had received Master's Degree from Michigan State University in Anthropology. Shah started his career in civil service as the publicity officer of the then Election Commission in 1958 B.S. and served under different capacities including district Panchayat Secretary, Palpa, Chief District Officer of Gorkha, Syangja and Sunsari, Deputy Director General of Radio Nepal, Joint Secretary in different government offices including the National Planning Commission, Zonal Commissioner of Bagmitati Zone and Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Information and Communication, and the Prime Minister's Office.

He was liberal, cooperative and continued academic studies even after retirement from public service.\" \"Shah always tried to forge consensus among the election commissioners while taking key decisions and he had never tried to impose his ideas on others\" recalls Prof. Dr. BIrendra Prasad Mishra, who had worked as the Election Commissioner under the tenure of Shah.\nAs a student Shah was talented, a mixable friend, qualified administrator, honest and loving parent of his family members. He had extraordinary wisdom, dedication and hardworking capacity and capacity to analyze things.

{"id": "39507942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39507942", "title": "Can Man Dan", "text": "Can Man Dan\n\nDan Johnstone (born July 31, 1987 in Edmonton, Alberta), also known as \"Can Man Dan,\" is a Canadian anti-poverty activist, philanthropist, community organizer, and social activist. His fundraising group, also called \"Can Man Dan,\" works to alleviate poverty and strengthen communities in Alberta by working with several non-profit groups and charities. Johnstone hosts many events around Alberta, but is perhaps best known for his annual \"Stand Against Hunger\" campaign, where every December, Dan camps out for weeks in the back of a tractor-trailer aiming to fill it with food donations for various food banks & charities around Alberta. Due to the severity of the winters commonly found in Alberta, and the freezing cold temperatures that go along with them, these campouts have become highly publicized and staple events for many food banks. Can Man Dan's \"Stand Against Hunger\" campaign has proven to be very successful, as Dan has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of pounds of food for local food banks from these events alone. Johnstone has created and hosted many other events around Alberta aimed to help those less fortunate, including his annual \"We're Here For Ya Day\" event. Can Man Dan offers free hair services, a barbecue lunch, personal hygiene products, backpacks filled with school supplies, fresh bread, and food hampers to thousands of men, women and children every year on this day.\n\nAfter growing up in a single-mother, low-income household, Johnstone was motivated to support the same services that his family had used while he was growing up and started the Can Man Dan initiative. Johnstone has stated that his ultimate goal is to raise awareness and support for charities in distress, and ultimately assist in the ending of poverty and homelessness in Alberta by forming a united community.\nOn top of the various community events that he hosts, Johnstone is also a motivational speaker that travels to many schools and high-profile events around western Canada to share his story and various adventures. Johnstone also leads an inner city feed program, where he and his group of volunteers make and distribute meals, care packages, and backpacks filled with different supplies to Edmonton's homeless community every month. Johnstone has stated, \"I have never made a single cent off of this initiative, and I never will,\" as he believes that helping others and spreading a positive message throughout the community is more important than making a profit. Johnstone has also been an outspoken supporter for many other social issues and programs such as the protection of domestic abuse victims, supporting LGBTQ rights and freedoms, initiating a basic income for Canadians, and defending social housing projects.\n\nJohnstone's activism and philanthropy work began in Edmonton, Alberta in the summer of 2011, when he began going door-to-door around various neighbourhoods by himself collecting food and clothing donations for various charities, such as the Edmonton Food Bank, the youth shelter, and various homeless shelters and soup kitchens. In June 2013, Can Man Dan provided immediate assistance to Calgary's Food Bank and those affected by the 2013 Alberta floods in the form of 5000 pounds of food. In both December 2013 and December 2014, local Edmonton chain restaurant, Delux Burger Bar, featured Can Man Dan as their \"Celebrity Chef.\" Delux Burger Bar locations across Edmonton added the Can Man Dan burger to their menus, and gave a portion of sales to the Edmonton Food Bank on Dan's behalf. Dan also arranged to have the Can Man Dan burger served to hundreds of Edmonton's homeless & less fortunate as he hosted \"Burger Night\" at one of Edmonton's local homeless shelters. Johnstone made headlines in April 2014 after he announced that he would wrestle in a professional wrestling match with Canadian wrestling promotion, the PWA (The Prairie Wrestling Alliance) to raise money, food and awareness for Edmonton's homeless youth population. Despite suffering a fractured nose during the bout, Johnstone ultimately won his debut wrestling match raising thousands of dollars and thousands of pounds of food for Edmonton's Youth Empowerment and Support Services (YESS), an organization that Dan's mother had used when she was a teenager. In the spring of 2015, Johnstone started a new community project aimed to help struggling locally-owned businesses attain new customers called \"Localive\". In June 2015, \"WO Magazine\" listed Johnstone as one of their \"Top 5 Anti-Poverty Activists\".\n\nIn the summer of 2015, Johnstone was voted in by Edmonton's general public to serve as an honorary parade marshal for their annual K-Days festival parade. Johnstone, along with five other community heroes and various departments of Edmonton's first responders, were made honorary parade marshals and each given $2500 to donate to a charity of their choice. In November 2015, a press release was issued announcing that Johnstone was made honorary chairman and official ambassador for Edmonton's Adopt-A-Teen program, a social program that Dan and his family used when he was growing up. Since being made Adopt-A-Teen's honorary chairman in 2015, Johnstone has helped provide thousands of low-income and underprivileged teenagers with a $50 gift card for Christmas. Johnstone made national headlines in December 2015 as he announced that he would spend the month touring Alberta and camping out in various cities to raise resources for multiple food banks across the province affected by the economic downturn. Johnstone's \"Tour of Alberta\" raised 25 tonnes of food and thousands of dollars for various food banks throughout Alberta to distribute to people in need. In May 2016, Johnstone revealed that he and his mother were former victims of domestic abuse and that he was starting a thirty-five-day campaign to raise awareness for domestic abuse victims and raise money for a local women's shelter (WIN House) in Edmonton. Johnstone's campaign consisted of completing six \"extreme and wacky\" stunts around Edmonton, which were intended to raise awareness and money. Johnstone's stunts included wrestling in a professional wrestling match against Ring Of Honor's Silas Young, becoming an Edmonton Eskimos cheerleader for a day, and undergoing intense police training with Edmonton Police Services, among other things.\n\nIn December 2016, Johnstone embarked on his \"Feed Alberta Tour\" hoping to raise food and funds for various food banks across Alberta that were hit hard due to the ongoing recession. Johnstone travelled to the cities that were most affected by the stagnant economy and camped out in freezing cold temperatures for several days on end. Johnstone's \"Feed Alberta Tour\" raised more than 50 000 pounds of food and close to $20 000 in cash donations. One month after its initial release in December 2016, Dan personally paid for forty low-income single parents and their children to watch \"Rogue One\" in theatres. Dan cited that Star Wars was one of his favorite movie franchises and he believed that all children should have the opportunity to watch it. In March 2017, Dan publicly urged Edmonton's city council to use a $38 million snow-removal surplus on renovating and restoring Edmonton's crumbling low-income housing units. In May 2017, Can Man Dan took 55 students from a local Catholic elementary school to down Edmonton's inner streets of to pass out hundreds of care packages filled with food, personal hygiene products, and socks to the cities' homeless and most vulnerable. In September 2017, Can Man Dan was voted \"Best Activist\" in Vue Weekly's \"Best of Edmonton 2017\" series. Readers, along with Edmonton's general public voted Johnstone as Edmonton's \"Best Activist\" for his hard work and dedication to the community. In November 2017, Dan announced that he was hosting the \"Can Man Dan city-wide food drive\" to replenish Edmonton's struggling local food bank, which was seeing record high usage at the time. Dan put out a plea to Edmonton residents and Edmonton's city council to help him \"refill all of the empty shelves\" at the Edmonton Food Bank and to work together to ensure that \"no one goes hungry\" over the holiday season. Dan's citywide food drive managed to raise over 110 000 pounds of food and $65 000 in 30 days.\n\nAfter the death of Colten Boushie, Dan was just one of many aboriginal leaders to publicly condemn the not-guilty verdict. In September 2018, Johnstone was able to equip 2 100 low-income children in the Edmonton region with school supplies, backpacks, food hampers, haircuts, and breakfast supplies before the 2018/2019 school semester started. Later that month, Can Man Dan was also voted Edmonton's \"Best Philanthropist\" in Vue Weekly's annual \"Best of Edmonton\" series, a local contest that is held ever year and where the winners are ultimately determined by online votes. In November 2018, Avenue Magazine awarded Dan with their prestigious \"Top 40 Under 40\" award for being a consummate changemaker and for his dedication to humanity.\n\nDaniel Lee Johnstone was born in Edmonton, Alberta on July 31, 1987 during the notorious Edmonton tornado (also known as \"Black Friday\") that claimed 27 lives, and he is the eldest son of Pamela Johnstone. Dan is an avid professional wrestling fan, a self-declared cinephile, and board game enthusiast. His favourite television show is \"Game of Thrones\", and he is also a huge fan of reality television, and has said that he one day hopes to compete on \"Big Brother Canada\" and \"The Amazing Race Canada\". Dan considers himself to be a political independent, but believes that all levels of government should take a more centrist approach when governing, as he believes that divisive and polarizing politics are harmful to a society and the community.\n\nIn June 2013, Dan Johnstone announced that he would be running in the Edmonton municipal election, 2013. Johnstone declared that he would be running for the open seat in Edmonton's Ward 10 which was vacated by Mayoral hopeful, Don Iveson. Johnstone, a self-declared fiscal conservative, was the youngest candidate running for any position in the 2013 Edmonton election, being only 25 years old when he announced his candidacy. Johnstone's platform was largely based on the repair of basic infrastructure, paying off the city's deficit, focusing on the revitalization of mature neighbourhoods, investing in the building of low income housing, as well as building a stronger public transit system while lowering fares. Johnstone also pledged to self-fund his entire campaign and donate $10 000 for each year of his terms' salary to various charities and causes around Edmonton citing that, \"politicians make entirely too much money.\" Johnstone openly refused to take money or campaign contributions from corporations, unions, developers, or special interest groups. He was ultimately defeated by former Alberta Party candidate, Michael Walters.\n\nOn December 27 of 2015, Johnstone announced his candidacy for the Ward 12 by-election race in Edmonton's south-side district to replace Amarjeet Sohi who was elected to Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in October 2015. Johnstone, once again labelling himself as a fiscal conservative and socially progressive candidate, concentrated on restructuring Edmonton's photo radar system and redirecting a majority of the revenue to Edmonton's Police services, ushering in a more economical public transit system, postponing the building of the Valley Line LRT route, and mandating that a certain percentage of newly developed land must contain low-income and other forms of social housing. Johnstone was also openly critical of the record-breaking thirty-two candidates citing that it would confuse casual voters and result in a low voter turnout. Johnstone was defeated by local police detective, Moe Banga.\n\nIn May 2018, Johnstone announced that he was seeking the Alberta Party nomination to be their official candidate in the upcoming 2019 Alberta provincial election. Johnstone was looking to represent the Alberta Party in the province's Edmonton-South district, but left near the end of June 2018, citing lack of \"leadership, direction, and organization;\" he also noted he was not impressed with the new leadership under Stephen Mandel, and preferred the leadership style of former Alberta Party leader Greg Clark. Although Johnstone's campaign was brief, he was running on a platform of lowering and controlling Alberta's ballooning debt (which is forecasted to hit $96 billion in 2023), supporting Alberta's small businesses and local entrepreneurs, investing in the building of more housing projects for low-income families and seniors, lowering taxes, protecting social programs that his family had used while living in poverty, and working to end the divisiveness often found in politics.\n\n"}
{"id": "15410971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15410971", "title": "Canadian name", "text": "Canadian name\n\nCanadian naming conventions vary based on whether one is Aboriginal Canadian, English Canadian or French Canadian.\n\nIn English Canada, names follow much the same convention as they do in the United States and United Kingdom. Usually the \"first name\" (as described in e.g. birth certificates) is what a child goes by, although a middle name (if any) may be preferred—both also known as \"given names.\" The \"last name\" is usually taken from a child's parents, which may be from either or both (joined by hyphenation). Outside Quebec (with distinct civil law system), either spouse has the right to assume the otherʼs last name, as long as it is not intended for the purposes of fraud. Getting married does not result in a legal change of name nor automatically change identification records. \n\nIt is not uncommon to see names that follow patterns differing from the English and French naming conventions.\n\n\nIn French Canada, up until the late 1960s, children of Roman Catholic origin were given three names at birth (usually not hyphenated): the first, Marie or Joseph, usually indicated the gender of the child. The second was usually the name of the godfather or godmother, while the third and last given name was the name used in everyday situations. Thus, a child prenamed \"Joseph Bruno Jean\" on his birth or baptismal certificate would indicate the baby was a boy, the godfather's first name was \"Bruno\" and that the child would be called \"Jean\" (and not \"Joseph\") for all intents and purposes of everyday life. A real-life example of this naming convention was that of Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien, who was born \"Joseph Jacques Jean Chrétien\".\n\nAlthough it is still permitted to list multiple names on a birth, it is uncommon for people to even be aware of their other given names, and the practice of using religious names became increasingly rarer after the Quiet Revolution as baptism ceremonies gradually became less common. The Quebec government officially recommends not using more than four given names.\n\n\nCurrently, most couples give the child the surname of the father, though the Quebec civil code allows a couple to combine at most two of their surnames, with or without hyphens. Thus a couple named \"Joseph Bouchard-Tremblay\" and \"Marie Dion-Roy\" could give to their children the surnames \"Bouchard\", \"Tremblay\", \"Dion\", \"Roy\", \"Bouchard-Tremblay\", \"Dion-Roy\", \"Bouchard-Dion\", \"Bouchard-Roy\", and so on.\n\nFollowing traditional French custom, Quebec women did not change their legal names upon marriage, but were referred to by their husband's surname in common speech. This latter practice fell out of favour following the Quiet Revolution, and spouses now retain their surnames after marriage in all contexts. A name change for marriage is difficult or impossible to do if desired, as requests to adopt a husband's name after marriage are typically denied.\n\n\nUntil the late 19th century, several families also had a \"nom-dit\" tradition. This was a family nickname (literally a \"said name\"). The origins of the \"noms-dits\" were various. Some \"noms-dits\" were the war-name of the first settler, while he was a soldier: \"Hébert dit Jolicœur\" (Pretty Heart, cf. Braveheart), \"Thomas dit Tranchemontagne\" (mountain chopper). Some denoted the place of origin of the first settler: \"Langevin\" (Anjou), \"Barbeau dit Poitevin\" (Poitou). Others denoted a characteristic of the person or of his dwelling: \"Lacourse\", \"Lépine\", \"Larivière\".\n\nMany, if not most, Indigenous Canadians (primarily in this First Nations and Métis people, but also Inuit to an extent) carry European surnames, and most of those are French names, either because of intermarriage with French Canadian and Métis men and indigenous women or because a surname was assigned to an indigenous person by a French-speaking Christian missionary. The most notable example is the Cardinal family, which started with a few French Canadians moving to the West and now includes thousands of Cree and Metis people in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and beyond. Other examples would Belcourt. Other European groups have contributed notably to indigenous, and especially Métis names, such as Isbister (Scottish), Hardisty (English), and so on.\n\nOn the Great Plains, many First Nations people have surnames that are direct English translations of an ancestor's given name, often these are multiple words long; examples would be Born with a Tooth (Blackfoot), Chief-Moon (Blood), or Whiteknife (Cree).\n\nFor others, a name in their ancestral language is rendered in English or French spelling such as Tootoosis (Plains Cree), Newashish (Atikamekw), or Yahgulanaas (Haida).\n\nSome people have a legal or baptismal name in English or French and separate name in their ancestral language, for example Oronhyatekha (Mohawk) who was also called Peter Martin.\n\nFor an overview of common Inuit names in Canada see List of Canadian Inuit.\n\nCourtesy titles may be used on official documents in Canada, and are frequently used in formal situations such as business correspondence or meetings.\n\nAs in other English-speaking countries, the following courtesy titles are used by default or can be chosen by the bearer when completing a form or application:\n\nWhen referring to a woman whose marital status that one does not know, it is common to write Ms., but no specific rules apply. Using a courtesy title in a non-formal situation may be construed as wrong and awkward.\n\nAlthough each person has one of the above titles in their name, other titles may be acquired through various ways. The titles of Dr. (doctor) and Prof. (Professor) are acquired through schooling. Often the titles for professors and medical doctors are used instead of the Given name of the individual when being said by one of the individuals students or patients. This does not apply, however, for friends and family and is strictly prohibited to those using the service of the individual and does not know the individual well enough. An example would be for a medical doctor named Mark. His friends would say, \"Hello, Mark,\" but his patients would say, \"Hello, doctor.\"\n\nThe parliamentary titles Hon. (honourable) or Rt. Hon. (right honourable) are given to serving cabinet ministers, either federal or provincial/territorial and in some cases are retained for life; for example in the case of retired prime ministers. Senators are designated with the prenominal title Sen. (Senator) while in office.\n\nForeign titles, such as Sir and Count, are not used; the acceptance of foreign honours by Canadian citizens is not permitted under the Nickle resolution and subsequent Acts of Parliament.\n\nSuffixes always come after the family name, and are also acquired for various reasons.\nSuffixes are only used in oral communication when necessary, and are also rarely written on the wish of the individual bearing the suffix.\n\nThe most common suffixes are Sr. (Senior) and Jr. (Junior). When an individual names their child after themselves or another family member (not necessarily immediate), that individual then bears the suffix Sr. and the offspring bears the suffix Jr., which may also be replaced with II (the second). The suffix \"III\" is used after either Jr or II and like subsequent numeric suffixes, does not need to happen in one family line. For example, if John and Bob Gruber are brothers and if Bob has a son before John, he will call his son John, II. If John now has a son, his son is John, Jr. As time passes, the III suffix goes to the first born of either John Jr or John II. This is how it is possible and correct for a Jr. to father a IV. Such suffixes are rare amongst French-Canadians due the strongly generational nature of most French given names.\n\nOther completely accepted suffixes include:\nMP and its provincial or territorial equivalents may be followed by the name of the constituency in which that member was elected. For example: Buddy Johnson, M.P. London North-Centre. However, the constituency name or similar designations are not shown of official documents outside of parliament and is never used in casual communication.\n\nPostnominals granted under the Canadian honour system include PC (Privy Councillor, granted to federal cabinet ministers and some other senior politicians including leaders of opposition parties); CM (Member of the Order of Canada); OC (Officer of the Order of Canada); and CC (Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest rank of that order). For a list of other postnominals, including professional titles and orders, provincial honours, and honours in gift of the Crown, see List of post-nominal letters in Canada.\n\n"}

He previously served in the Ohio State Senate and the Ohio House of Representatives.\n\nWilson was born on January 18, 1943 in either Martins Ferry, Ohio or Dillonvale, Ohio. He was a graduate of Ohio University and the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science class of 1967. He was a small business owner and was president of Wilson Funeral Homes and Wilson Furniture Store.\n\nWilson ran for Ohio's 99th House District in 1996. He defeated William L. Thomas in the Democratic primary 54%–46%. He won the general election and re-election in 1998 (50%), 2000 (68%), and 2002 (62%).\n\nIn 2004, he ran for the Ohio Senate when incumbent Democrat Greg DiDonato of the 30th District decided to retire after redistricting. In the Democratic primary, he defeated State Representative Jerry Krupinski 67%–33%. He won the general election with 67% of the vote. When he decided to retire to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, his son Jason Wilson replaced him.\n\nWilson had offices in: Canfield, Wellsville, Marietta, Bridgeport and Ironton, Ohio.\n\n\nIn 2006, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Ted Strickland decided to retire to run for Governor of Ohio. Wilson decided to run for the open seat in Ohio's 6th congressional district. Ohio state law requires that a candidate for Congress submit 50 valid signatures from constituents in his district to qualify for a place on the primary ballot. When Wilson's signatures were verified by the Columbiana County Board of Elections, only 46 of the 93 signatures submitted could be verified as legal residents of the 6th district.\n\nAs such, for the Democratic primary on May 2, 2006, Charlie Wilson's name did not appear on the ballot. Wilson's campaign launched a massive effort, aided by the national party and organized labor, to 'write-in' Charlie Wilson's name in the primary. The campaign was successful, with Wilson winning 66% of the Democratic vote against two opponents. Wilson defeated Republican State Representative Chuck Blasdel 62%–38%.\n\n\nWilson defeated Republican Richard Stobbs 62%–33%.\n\n\nWilson was defeated by Republican U.S. Air Force veteran Bill Johnson 50%–45%.\n\nFollowing the 2010 campaign, Wilson was criticized for giving his staff large bonuses with taxpayer money as he was ending his term. Congressman Wilson's staff payroll increased by 49.7% from the previous payroll quarter, indicating that his staff did indeed receive hefty taxpayer funded bonuses.\n\n\nIn November 2011, Wilson filed to run a rematch against Johnson in the newly redrawn 6th Congressional District.\n\nThe race for Ohio's 6th Congressional District was listed as one of the most competitive in the country. It was one of the 24 toss-up races in the New York Times 2012 House Race Ratings. Some of the major issues in the race were jobs and the economy, health care, and energy. On the issue of coal, Wilson told NPR that \"We don't need to fire Obama and we don't need to stop the war on coal\", in an interview on September 28, 2012.\n\nHis spokesman said the candidate was being sarcastic, calling the comments \"the farthest thing from the truth. Charlie has fought against both administrations, both the Bush administration and the Obama administration in the battle for coal.\"\n\nWhen asked about the Supreme Court ruling on President Obama's health care law, Wilson said he viewed the tax as a way of encouraging people to buy insurance and was quoted saying: \"I look at it as a way of directing people into what would be a good decision for them,\"\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Wilson was defeated by Johnson 53% to 47% in the rematch of their 2010 race in a slightly more Republican-leaning district, drawn after the 2010 census.\n\nAfter entering office, Wilson joined the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate and conservative congressional Democrats. Wilson was named Blue Dog of the Week on April 2, 2007. Wilson voted \"Yes\" on the Senate version of the health care bill.\n\nAlong with Rep. Marion Berry (D-AR) and Rep. Mike Ross (D-AR), Wilson introduced H.R.3090 in July 2007 to counteract a provision tucked away in the Iraq Spending Bill. The provision required that all Medicaid prescriptions be written on \"tamper-resistant pads\" effective October 1, 2007. The provision was put in place to combat Medicaid prescription fraud, but it may have unintended consequences. For example, the pads may not be widely available, nor is there a good definition of what they are. If pharmacists fill prescriptions that are not written on the special pads they risk not getting reimbursed through Medicaid.\n\nWilson's bill would have required that only Class II narcotics prescriptions, like OxyContin, be written on tamper-resistant pads. \"This will prevent the most dangerous fraud without preventing those in need from receiving their everyday medications,\" Wilson said.\n\nWhile the above action in pending action by the Subcommittee on Health, a six-month delay in the effective date was passed as part of H.R. 3668.\n\n\nCongressman Wilson was a member of the Rural Caucus, Sportsmen's Caucus, and the Steel Caucus. He assumed a leadership position in the Steel Caucus, serving as a member of the executive board.\n\nWilson had four sons and nine grandchildren. His son, Jason, served in the Ohio Senate.\n\nOn February 21, 2013, Wilson suffered a brain aneurysm while vacationing in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was put into a medically induced coma. In early March, he entered a rehabilitation facility in Florida and had been \"doing much better\". On April 13, Wilson was admitted to a hospital in Boynton Beach, Florida after feeling ill. He died on April 14 of complications from the earlier stroke. He was 70.\n"}

He used both serial and tonal techniques. He is best known for his quartets and thirteen symphonies (some composed in his own system of 'Complex Metres') and for his song settings for Dylan Thomas's play, \"Under Milk Wood\".\n\nJones was born in Pembroke in south Wales. His father, Jenkyn Jones, was a composer and his mother a singer, and by the time he was nine years old the young Daniel had himself written several piano sonatas.\n\nHe attended the Bishop Gore School in Swansea (1924–1931), where his enthusiasm for literature led to a close friendship with the poet Dylan Thomas, and to his going on to study English literature at Swansea University. At this period Jones and Thomas were part of the informal group of aspiring artists who would meet at the Kardomah cafe in Castle Street, Swansea. Other members of the group were the poet Vernon Watkins and the painter Alfred Janes. In 1935 Jones left Swansea to study music at the Royal Academy of Music in London (1935–1938), where his teachers included Sir Henry Wood and Harry Farjeon. Winning the Mendelssohn Scholarship in 1935 allowed him to study in Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands and Germany, and to develop his skills as a linguist.\n\nIn 1937 Jones married Penelope Eunice Bedford, with whom he would have three daughters. In the years leading up to World War II he composed his first large-scale orchestral works – 'Symphonic Prologue' and 'Five Pieces for Orchestra' – and developed his own compositional system of 'Complex Metres'.\n\nDuring the War, as a captain in the Intelligence Corps (1940–1946), he used his linguistic abilities at Bletchley Park codes centre as a cryptographer and a decoder of Russian, Romanian and Japanese texts. In 1944 Jones married his second wife, Irene Goodchild, with whom he would have one son and one daughter.\n\nAfter the War, Jones won increasing recognition as an innovative composer. In 1950 his \"Symphonic Prologue\" won the first prize of the Royal Philharmonic Society, and thereafter most of his compositions were written to commission – from the Festival of Britain, the Swansea Festival, the Royal National Eisteddfod, the BBC, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Llandaff Festival. Between 1945 and 1985 he composed his series of twelve symphonies, each centred on one semi-tone of the chromatic scale, and in 1992 his unnumbered \"Symphony In Memoriam John Fussell\" (his friend, the Director of the Swansea Festival). By 1993 he had composed eight string quartets, as well as works in many other genres, including the cantata, \"The Country Beyond the Stars\", a setting of Henry Vaughan's poem.\n\nJones enjoyed long friendships with several artists, among them Vernon Watkins, Ceri Richards and Grace Williams, and, most closely, Dylan Thomas. As well as composing song-settings for Thomas's \"Under Milk Wood\" (1954) and dedicating his fourth symphony (1954) to Thomas's memory, he edited collections of Thomas's poetry and prose, and in 1977 published the memoir, \"My Friend Dylan Thomas\".\n\nIn 1968 Jones was awarded an OBE.\n\nHe died in Swansea in 1993. His archive is held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. An oil portrait of Jones by Alfred Janes is held by the National Museum Cardiff; a photographic portrait by Bernard Mitchell (1967) is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London.\n\nIn 2008 the actor Adrian Metcalf and composer Rob Marshall drew on the compositions and writings of Jones and Thomas in their tribute, \"Warmley\" (named after Daniel Jones's boyhood home).\n\nBy 1936, Jones had devised his own compositional system of Complex Metres, which was fully developed in his \"Sonata for Three Non-Chromatic Kettle-Drums\" (1947). In 1950, he described this system: 'The unifying element of fixed pattern is present, but the pattern itself is asymmetrical, therefore with a powerful means of satisfying structural requirements there would seem to be possible both a greater variety and a greater subtlety in the rhythm-metre relationship'. Jones's system was adapted in Germany by the composer Boris Blacher. For Jones himself his complex structures had always to be allied with emotive intention. As is the case with other composers who used both serial techniques and tonality, Jones's music may for a time have seemed too advanced for traditionalists and too old-fashioned for the avant-garde.\n\n\n\n"}

After espousing virulently neo-fascistic and segregationist views in the 1950s under the tutelage of Pound, Wand moved to California in the 60s and became a supporter of the Black Power movement, seeing parallels between the Asian-American and African-American experience.\n\nWand was born on December 28, 1931 in Hangzhou, China, and claimed to be a direct descendent of Tang dynasty poet Wang Wei (699–759). He attended St. John's Middle School in Shanghai, and fled to the United States as a refugee from the Communist Revolution in 1949. While Wand's family was anti-communist, he expressed admiration for Mao's poetry and considered Chiang Kai-shek \"an intellectual midget.\" He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1955, studying English and Italian and joining the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.\n\nIn 1955, Wand (writing as David Rafael Wang) began corresponding with Ezra Pound, who was incarcerated at St. Elizabeths Hospital following his arrest and trial for treason against the United States in 1945. In their letters, Wand and Pound discussed their shared interest in Confucius and Chinese written characters, with Wand calling Pound “the greatest poet writing in the English language\" and Pound taking particular interest in Wand's name's middle logogram (燊), lifting its meaning \"flame-style king\" for the ideogram of the 1959 \"Thrones Cantos\".\n\nAfter graduating from Dartmouth, Wand moved to New York, where he worked a series of odd jobs while continuing his correspondence with Pound (he visited him at St. Elizabeths in 1956). Increasingly neo-fascistic, antisemitic and segregationist in his worldview, Wand sought Pound for guidance, writing in October 1957, “For eugenics' sake, please tell me what the best books on money issue are.\" He frequently wrote in praise of far-right activist (and fellow Pound devotee) John Kasper and in support of racial purity and eugenic breeding, exclaiming in a July 12, 1957 letter that:My impression of the French is that they are of all Europeans the closest to the kikes in spirit and nature. 11 years of living under the French in Shanghai have taught me that they are more beastly than the Japs. The Italians and the Germans were the only Europeans who acted civilized. I am for an united Europe under the rule of either Germany or Italy. Adolf and Benito were certainly close to saints.Wand believed strongly in male chauvinism, recounting a disagreement with a female friend that \"Adolf knew where women should belong more than any other political leaders. Told her that glorification of the ‘New Woman' by murky thinkers like Ibsen and GBS has lead [sic] to family disunity and political chaos in the West.\" Despite opposition to miscegenation, Wand justified marriage proposals to Marcella Spann and Sherri Martinelli on the grounds that their offspring would be genetically superior.\n\nWhile Wand expressed hostility for homosexuals and \"effeminate\" intellectuals, railing against “intellectual molly-coddles,\" “effeminate weaklings,” “liberaloid eggheads,\" and “milksop ‘Poundians',” he declared his admiration for physically fit men of action: the \"plain jock,\" \"prizefighters and cattlebreeders,\" and imagined setting up gymnasium-bookstores where men could work out and \"exchange ideas and practice target-shooting, which may come in handy later in dealing with the Dulleses and Stevensons etc.\" He wrote to Pound about his intention to become a sports writer and wrote poems about bodybuilders and Elvis Presley, whom he saw as a hero because he “at least makes one feel like fucking or busting the noses of some spineless poetic jerks like Richard Eberhart and W. H. Auden and murdering some filthy intellectual scumbags like Adlai Stevenson and/or Anthony Eden.\"\n\nIn 1957, Wand organized the “North American Citizens for the Constitution: An Affiliation of the Whib Party\" (Whib was an acronym that Pound invented for \"Wheat in bread\" based on his interest in grain-rites), an intellectual front for John Kasper's segregationist activities that sought to carry his ideas to Ivy League campuses. The NACC supported \"racial integrity,\" states' rights, and the right to bear arms while opposing \"the forced integration of races,\" the NAACP, the Urban League, and the Anti-Defamation League. They accused President Eisenhower of treason and threatened \"Marxist, usurer, race-mixer, degenerate politician, we pledge eternal vigilance, eternal combativeness, even death!\"\n\nWand's activities with the NACC compelled a former Dartmouth classmate, David Rattray, to accuse him in a November 1957 issue of \"The Nation\" of supporting “the cause of white supremacy\" and of “touring the Ivy League colleges with the purpose of setting up White Citizens' councils on the campuses.\" Wand, in a letter to the editor in December 1957, wrote that My main purpose in life is to fight against bigotry and racial prejudice while upholding the separate but equal station to which the laws of nature have entitled us. I am strongly against forced integration. I am strongly against miscegenation. I am against those who have lost their racial integrity and desire to be assimilated with the white race.Wand later suggested that the \"Nation\" article cost him his job at a local YMCA, and made him fear deportation to China. Wand's correspondences with Ezra Pound ended in 1958, shortly after Pound's release from St. Elizabeth's and subsequent return to Italy.\n\nPound and Noel Stock put Wand in touch with William Carlos Williams after Williams expressed admiration for Wand's English translations of Chinese poetry in \"Edge,\" writing that his poems \"are worth the trip half way round the world to have encountered.” Wand visited Williams's house in Rutherford, New Jersey in March 1957 and the two began collaborating on a poetry collection, \"The Cassia Tree\" (published in \"New Directions\" in 1966, after Williams's death), in which Wand provided word-by-word translations of 37 Tang and Song-era poems and Williams turned them into English poems.\n\nWilliams encouraged Wand to work on \"The Grandfather Cycle\", a sequence of 101 cantos (mirroring Pound's \"Cantos\") that Wand had begun in 1956. The unfinished work was meant to feature Wand's \"fabulous ancestors,\" including his grandfather Wang Fenggao, one of the last mandarin civil servants and founder of Guanghua University in Shanghai, with \"comments on sex, marriage, and prostitution, and references to Eugenics.\" In one canto, Wand describes his grandfather, the protagonist, and his sexual prowess and diverse progeny: In Shanghai / by the Yangtze River / Where I watched / the ships / Coming in going out / of the harbor / And the tiny sampans / tremulous on the wave, / I used to sit / beneath the peach blossoms / Near the Lungwha Tower, / with swallows / Dipping over my head / and sandcrabs / Scurrying near my feet / And think about / The epic fornications / of my Fabulous / Grandfather. / Great man! / He sired / Eight sons / and some / Twenty bastards / by / Three wives / and / Four dozen / Concubines / in an age / when virginity / Was the eunuch's lot / and polygamy / the strong man's goal. / His offspring / Multiplied, / Spread from / Hangchow to / London, / Paris to / Mukden— / Some begotten / On ships, / Some made / in sampans; / All different: / Blonde hair, /Grey eyes, / Widow's peak, / Curly beard, / Till even / Tao-Kwan & / T'ung Tse, / the emperors, / became envious of / him, / the plucker of peaches & apple blossoms.Eliot Weinberger, writing on Wand's artistic influences and outspoken bigotry, notes the difference between his relationship with Pound (who was an outspoken bigot) and Williams (who wasn't):What interests me [...] is that not only Pound (from whom we expect such things) but Williams and others were not merely tolerating but working with people like Wang in the 1950's—regardless of the daily reports of segregationist violence. That is, although Williams (unlike Pound) probably disagreed with Wang's extremism, his racism and political fanaticism were still considered as minor peccadilloes to be excused in the Artist.\n\nWand left New York for San Francisco in 1958, where he began as a reporter for \"The Chinese World\", a bilingual newspaper based on Chinatown. In 1959, he enrolled in a creative writing program at San Francisco State College, where he continued to work on cantos for \"The Grandfather Cycle\". While spending time at local bookstores, he met Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, Clarence Major, and Cid Corman. \n\nAfter receiving his M.A. in 1961, Wand moved to Honolulu, where he taught at both the University of Hawaii and Iolani Preparatory School until 1964. While in Hawaii, Wand became acquainted with Hawaiian and Samoan oral poetry, and published several translations into English.\n\nIn 1964, Wand moved to Los Angeles, where he began teaching at Santa Ana College and Santa Monica City College, and then enrolled in the Comparative Literature doctoral program at USC. In an arranged marriage set up by his mother in 1966, he married Yuet-fun and had one daughter.\n\nOf his poetry in the 1960s and 1970s, Wand told James Laughlin, “Other than Mao Tse-tung and two other poets in Hong Kong, I am about the leading modern Chinese poet [...] No other Chinese poet has blended the Greco-Sino-Samurai African tradition in poetry as I have done.\" Ashe explained, \"in my writing I aim at the concision of the Greek epigram, the warmth and geniality of T'ang \"shih\" and Sung \"tz'u\", the virility and martial spirit of the Zen-samurai arts, and the form and changes of jazz.\"\n\nIn California, Wand became increasingly outspoken about his twin identities as a poet and an academic, and the separate names—David Rafael Wang and David Hsin-Fu Wand—that corresponded to them. In 1974, he said that\"My role as poet has been kept distinct from my role as professor, and the two identities coexist in a symbiotic relationship much as Dr. Haggard and Mr, Jive. As David Hsin-Fu Wand I am chiefly a critic and teacher of English and comparative literature, while as David Rafael Wang I am a poet, found by most of my friends to be rather anti-intellectual in my poetry.In 1975, Wand released \"The Intercourse\", a poetry collection that focused heavily on the physicality of the body, including poems about dance, gymnastics, bodybuilding, surfing, bathing, and heterosexual and homosexual encounters. The collection continues to espouse male chauvinist attitudes toward sexuality but also expresses sympathy for the Black Power movement: in one poem, he writes “If you don't get this, man, dig: / Us spade cats will shovel white trash / into the underground furnace of love.\"\n\nAs an academic, completed his doctorate in 1972, entitling his dissertation \"Cathay Revisited: The Chinese Tradition in the Poetry of Ezra Pound and Gary Snyder.\" In 1974, he taught at the University of New Mexico, where he incorporated martial arts demonstrations into his lectures about Asian poetry, citing the samurai tradition of the warrior-poet. He expressed admiration for Muhammad Ali and discussed poetry with him during Ali's visit to Albuquerque. At the time of his death, Wand held a Comparative Literature position at the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nIn 1974, Wand released an anthology of contemporary Asian-American writers entitled \"Asian-American Heritage: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry,\" which included works by writers of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino descent. \n\nContributors to the anthology include Chung Ling, John Hideyo Hamamura, Sadakichi Hartmann, Richard E. Kim, Kim Yong-Ik, Alexander Kuo, Stephen S. N. Liu, Pardee Lowe, Wing Tek Lum, Suzi Mee, Janice Mirikitani, Toshio Mori, Paul Motoyoshi, Jr., Francis Naohiko Oka, John Okada, Daniel I. Okimoto, Irvin Paik, Jose Garcia Villa, and Hisaye Yamamoto, as well as many translations of Samoan and Hawaiian poetry by Armand Schwerner and Wand himself (credited as David Rafael Wang). Wand justifies including Polynesian oral translations because \"Polynesian-American literature [...] belongs to American literature as much as Amerindian lores [...] It belongs to Asian-American literature because Hawaiians and Samoans are native Americans of the fiftieth state, which is geographically a part of Southeast Asia.\"\n\nIn his introduction, Wand explores the question of Asian American identity:Refusing to be \"whitewashed\" or \"enlightened,\" these younger Asian-Americans are proud of being Americans of Asian ancestry. While with every word they write they proclaim their identity with Chinatowns or \"Nihonmachi\", they write exclusively in American English, enlivened with the staccato rhythm of jazz. These rebellious young writers have mroe in common with Elridge Cleaver, Imamu Baraka, George Jackson, and the militant blacks than with Lin Yutang, C.Y. Lee (author of the popular \"Flower Drum Song\"), and S.I. Hayakawa, whom they despise.After describing at length the history of Asian Americans from the 1800s to the present, he concludes by drawing a more explicit parallel between the Asian-American experience and black freedom struggles worldwide:Unashamed to be yellow, Asian-Americans of the postwar generations tend to align themselves with the Third World Movement. They find their inspiration in Frantz Fanon, author of the \"Wretched of the Earth\", rather than Hayakawa or Lin Yutang. Like the black rebels, with whom they feel a close spiritual affinity, they demand an end to racial injustice and fight for a proper assessment of their ethnic heritage.In 1975, the Modern Language Association appointed Wand to their Commission on Minority Groups, at the time chaired by critic María Teresa Babín Cortés. \n\nWand died on April 7th, 1977 during a meeting of the Commission on Minority Groups at the Barbizon Plaza Hotel in New York. Authorities reported that he fell out of his 11th floor window, although whether he committed suicide, fell by accident, or was pushed remains unclear. His autopsy report ruled out foul play.\n\n\"Asian-American Heritage: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry.\" Washington Square Press (1974)\n\n“T’ang and Sung Poems”; “Ce-Lia the Immortal Beauty.” \"Edge\" 3 (Feb. 1957)\n\n\"The Cassia Tree\" (with William Carlos Williams). \"New Directions\" 19 (1966)\n\n\"Funeral Eva,\" \"Technicians of the Sacred: A Range of Poetries from Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Oceania\" (1969)\n\n\"The Intercourse.\" Greenfield Review Press (1975)\n\n"}

Booth\n\nEugene Theodore Booth, Jr. (28 September 1912 – 6 March 2004) was an American nuclear physicist. He was a member of the historic Columbia University team which made the first demonstration of nuclear fission in the United States. During the Manhattan Project, he worked on gaseous diffusion for isotope separation. He was the director of the design, construction, and operation project for the 385-Mev synchrocyclotron at the Nevis Laboratories, the scientific director of the SCALANT Research Center, and dean of graduate studies at Stevens Institute of Technology.Booth was the scientific director of the SCALANT Research Center, in Italy.\n\nHe was born on 28 September 1912 in Rome, Georgia to Reverend Eugene Theodore Booth, Sr. and Lucy Cornelia Gibson.\n\nBooth studied physics at the University of Georgia, where he received his Bachelor of Science (1932), Master of Science (1934), and Doctor of Philosophy (1937) degrees. In 1934, he was a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nBooth joined the Columbia University faculty as a lecturer. He also helped professor John R. Dunning with his cyclotron construction and research. Thus began Booth’s lengthy professional collaboration with Dunning.\n\nIn December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to \"Naturwissenschaften\" reporting they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons; simultaneously, they communicated these results to Lise Meitner. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted these results as being nuclear fission. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939. In 1944, Hahn received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the discovery of nuclear fission. Some historians have documented the history of the discovery of nuclear fission and believe Meitner should have been awarded the Nobel Prize with Hahn.\n\nEven before it was published, Meitner’s and Frisch’s interpretation of the work of Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. It was soon clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On 25 January 1939, Booth was a member of the experimental team at Columbia University which conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States, which was done in the basement of Pupin Hall; the other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, John R. Dunning, Enrico Fermi, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack.\n\nDuring World War II, Booth was a member of Columbia’s scientific staff in the Division of War Research. During the Manhattan Project, Dunning conducted pioneering work at Columbia University on gaseous diffusion to separate uranium isotopes; others working on the project included Booth, Henry A. Boorse, Willard F. Libby, Alfred O. C. Nier, and Francis G. Slack.\n\nAfter World War II, Booth was director of the project for the design, construction, and operation of a 385-MeV Synchrocyclotron at the Nevis Laboratories in Irvington-on-the-Hudson. The project was a collaborative effort of Columbia University, the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and the Office of Naval Research.\n\nHe died on 6 March 2004 in Briarcliff Manor, New York.\n\nA middle school in Woodstock, Georgia named after his father E.T. Booth was opened at 6550 Putnam Ford Drive, in Woodstock, his home town.\n\n\n\n"}

As MacArthur's interpreter he lived at the American Embassy with the MacArthur family, and served as interpreter at the initial meeting between MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito. While an official censor for Japanese theater he became its champion.\n\nAfter the war he taught at the New School for Social Research, and at Kansas University as Distinguished Professor of Asian Studies. He also served as music editor or reviewer for various periodicals.\n\nBowers became a respected authority on oriental art and culture, writing scholarly monographs on such subjects as Indian dance and Japanese theatre, as well as a definitive two-volume biography of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin. His book, \"Japanese Theatre\", was published in 1952 and is highly recommended by James Michener, in his book on Japanese ukiyo-e prints, \"The Floating World\", as \"one of the foremost works of scholarship dealing with Japanese culture to come out of the occupation.\"\n\nHe was married from 1951–1966 to Indian writer Santha Rama Rau. They had one son who, according to his parents, traveled widely and lived an affluent vagabond existence.\n\nBowers was interviewed for Columbia University's Oral History Project in 1960. He wrote the first full-length biography of Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872–1915) in two volumes (1970, 2nd edition 1996) and was a member of the Bagby Foundation for the Musical Arts in New York City. He died in New York City on 17 November 1999.\n\nBowers is known as \"The Man Who Saved Kabuki\" in Japan. While on his way to Indonesia in 1940, he visited Tokyo's Kabuki-za where he watched the famous Kanadehon Chūshingura kabuki play, and was very moved by kabuki as an art form. Four years later he returned to Japan as General MacArthur's secretary during the American Occupation of Japan. At this time the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers thought kabuki should be banned for its portrayal of feudal values. Bowers was strongly against this, stating that \"Kabuki is not only Japanese culture but world culture and must be preserved for the future.\" He promoted kabuki plays and instructed that a \"Dream Team\" cast of big kabuki stars should be assembled to perform \"Kanadehon Chūshingura\" in 1947. This performance and many others performed at the Tokyo Army College were a success, and the cast later performed the play in 1950 in East Coast venues across the US.\n\nBowers was awarded the Bronze Star in 1944, and an Oak Leaf Cluster in 1945.\n\nIn 1985, Bowers was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the government of Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2008060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2008060", "title": "Filipino name", "text": "Filipino name\n\nIn the Philippines, varying naming customs are observed, whether it is given name first, family name last, a mixture of native conventions with those of neighbouring territories, etc. The most common iteration amongst Filipinos is a blend of the older Spanish system and Anglo-American conventions, where there is a distinction between the \"Christian name\" from \"surname\". The construct of having several names in the middle name convention is common to all systems, but to have multiple \"first\" names and only one middle and last name is a result of the blending of American and Spanish naming customs. The Tagalog language is one of the few national languages in Asia to use the Western name order. Thus, the Philippine naming custom is coincidentally identical to the Spanish and Portuguese name customs.\n\nFor the most part, most Filipinos abide by the Spanish system of using both paternal and maternal surnames, the latter constituting the \"middle name\". An example would be \"Jose Cuyegkeng y Mangahas\" becoming \"Jose Mangahas Cuyegkeng\", where the particle y is used only for legal purposes and is otherwise dropped. The middle name in its natural sense would have been the second name if the person had one, but is never counted as an individual's given name.\n\nFilipinos tend to use middle names and surnames always.\n\nFilipinos may have one or more official given names (as registered in their birth certificates and baptismal certificates) and various types of temporary or permanent nicknames. Filipinos have a penchant for giving themselves or each other various sorts of nicknames and monikers. Some nicknames are carried for life while others are used only with certain groups so a person can have multiple nicknames at different ages or among different groups of people.\n\nLong given names can be shortened in various ways. \"Emmanuel\" can become \"Eman\", \"Manuel\", \"Manolo\", \"Manny\", or \"Manoy\". \"Consolación\" has been converted to \"Connie\", \"Cons\", \"Sol\", or \"Chona\".\n\nFilipino women with two given names such as \"María Cristina\" or \"María Victoria\" may choose to abbreviate the very common \"María\" (in honour of the Virgin Mary) as \"Ma\". (with a full stop), thus rendering these given names as \"Ma. Cristina\" or \"Ma. Victoria\". Filipino males with two given names such as \"José Mariano\" or \"José Gerardo\" could follow the same practice of abbreviating \"Josés\" as \"Jo.\", but this is not as consistent. Some Muslims would follow conventions found in neighbouring Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia, abbreviating \"\"Muhammad\" (and its variants, \"viz.\" \"Mohammed\", etc.) as \"Muhd.\" or \"Mohd.\"\"\n\nAnother common practice rarely seen in other cultures (but common with Spanish conventions) is to elide or combine multiple given names into one nickname. The aforementioned \"María Cristina\" and \"María Victoria\" may thus acquire the nicknames \"Maricris\" and \"Marivic\". Thus the Filipino names \"Maricel\", \"Maritoni\", \"Marijo\", \"Maritess\", and \"Maricon\" come from \"Maria Celia (or Celeste)\", \"Marie Antoinette\", \"María Josefa\" (or \"Josefina)\", \"María Teresa\", and \"María Concepción\" (or \"Consolación)\". The popular male nicknames \"Joma\", \"Jomar\", and \"Jomari\" are derived from concatenating \"José Mariano\". \"Jestoni\" was derived from \"Jesús Antonio\". These types of nicknames have become so common that they have also been registered as a child's official given name by the parents (e.g., \"Maricris Llamador Gunigundo\" or \"Maricris Ll. Gunigundo\"). The child \"Sidperl\" got his name when his parents combined their given names \"Isidro\" and \"Perlita\".\n\nSometimes, this practice results in a completely new, unprecedented given name. Former Vice-President Jejomar Binay's given name is a combination of \"Jesus-Joseph-Mary\". A former senator's first name was \"Heherson\", derived from \"He-Her-Son\" (from \"He, Her [Virgin Mary]'s Son\", referring to Jesus Christ). The unique, patriotic female names \"Luzviminda\" and its variants \"Minvilu\" and \"Vizminda\" come from concatenating the names of the country's three main island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.\n\nSome first names like \"Lodegrano\" or \"Lorimer\" may have been invented on the spot by the parents or derived from some partially remembered foreign term. Other coined first names have unusual spellings or spellings which are pronounced differently.\n\nHonorifics and titles are sometimes used in place of a person's actual name. Thus, the titles for family elders are often used by the younger persons and then adopted by the wider community: \"Apo\" (grandson/granddaughter). \"Lolo\" (grandfather) and \"Lola\" (grandmother) are used for senior elders; \"Tatay/Itay/Ama\" (father) or \"Tito/Tiyo/Tsong\" (uncle) and \"Nanay/Inay/Ina\" (mother) or \"Tita/Tiya/Tsang\" (aunt) for middle-aged elders; \"Manong\" or \"Kuya\" (elder brother) and \"Manang\" or \"Ate\" (elder sister) for anyone slightly older than the person speaking.\n\nPeople in the community are often addressed by their military or police rank, professional titles or job descriptions, either with or without their names. \"Architect\", \"Attorney\", \"Engineer\", \"Dok/Doctor\", \"Direk/Director\", \"Manager\", \"Bisor\" (supervisor), \"Boss\", \"Tsip/Chief\", are used in the same way as \"Mister\", \"Miss\", \"Ms\"., or \"Mrs\". especially when the addressee's name is not yet known by the speaker. This is often done as a sign of respect and to avoid giving offence. Even foreigners who work in the Philippines or are naturalized Filipino citizens, including foreign spouses of Filipinos, who hold some of these titles and descriptions are addressed in the same way as their Filipino counterparts, although it may sound awkward or unnatural to some of them or language purists who argue that the basic titles that precede surnames and either \"Sir\" or \"Ma'am/Madam\" are to be employed for simplicity. Also, \"Sir\" and \"Madam/Ma'am\" are not to be used precede a nickname.\n\nPeople with the same name as their father are registered as \"Junior\" (abbreviated to \"Jr\".) or numbered with Roman numerals (III, IV, V, etc.); their father adds \"Senior\" (\"Sr\".) after his surname or suffix. Inevitably, the younger person tends to be nicknamed \"Junior\" or \"Jun\" permanently. One person's nickname became \"Third\" because his full name was \"Alfonso Ma. Roxas Cuyegkeng III\" (this is a fictional name for example purposes). Thus a family will necessarily bestow a variety of unofficial nicknames to distinguished the various people having with nearly identical official given names.\n\nThe names of children in some families may follow a certain pattern, such as beginning with a certain letter of the alphabet, e.g. \"Diego Arnel\", \"Diamond Amelia\", \"Danford Arman\", \"Dolores Allison\", such that all their initials will be the same, i.e., \"DAZL\" if the middle name is \"Zulueta\" and the surname is \"Lim\". One group of siblings was named after countries (\"Arabia\", \"Australia\", \"Aruba\", \"Albania\") while another was named after car trademarks (\"Ford\", \"Mercedes\", \"Bentley\", \"Maserati\"). Other names seemed to have been taken from popular brand names, food, fruits, and flowers: \"Ramcar\", \"Cherry Pie\", \"Apple\", \"Peachy\", \"Pepsi\", \"Brandy\". World Champion boxer Manny Pacquiao named his two daughters \"Queen Elizabeth\" and \"Princess\" while his wife is named \"Jinky\". Former Philippine Senator Joker Arroyo (legal name) has a brother named Jack.\n\nMany nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers. Examples are the numerous \"Boy\", \"Toto/Totoy\" (young boy), \"Girlie\", \"Nene\" (young girl), \"Baby\" and similar types of pet names given to people who received them as kids and carried them into adult life and seniority. They've carried the nickname all their lives and see no incongruity in being called \"Boy\" or \"Baby\" even when in their sixth decade. Some are diminutives of the actual name, such as \"Pepito\" for \"Pepe\", \"Juanito\" for \"Juan\" (or the English form \"Johnny\" for \"John\"), and \"Nenita\" for \"Nena\". Thus, a person used to being called \"Joselito\" (\"Little Joseph\") as a child may retain the nickname as an adult even if he could already be called \"José\" or \"Joseph\".\n\nThe Filipino given name \"Dranreb\" was invented by reversing the spelling of the English name \"Bernard\", while someone calling himself \"Nosrac\" bears the legal name \"Carson\". Joseph Ejército Estrada, Thirteenth President of the Philippines, began as a movie actor and received his nickname \"Erap\" as an adult; it comes from \"Pare\" spelled backwards (from Spanish \"compadre\", \"fellow godparent\") but now means \"mate\" or \"buddy\" in Filipino.\n\nAn old custom is to replace or insert Filipino phonemes into a Spanish or English name: \"Mariano\" becomes \"Nano\", \"Edwin\" becomes \"Aweng\", \"Eduardo\" becomes \"Dwarding\", \"Roberto\" becomes \"Berting\", \"Ponciano\" becomes either \"Popoy\", \"Onse\", or \"Syano\". Sometimes there is a tendency to convert a grand-sounding given name into something very ordinary, such as when \"John Paul\" becomes \"JayPee\", \"Peter John\" becomes \"Peejong\", \"Anthony\" becomes \"Tonyo\", \"Ronald\" becomes \"Onad\", \"María Elena\" becomes \"Ineng\" or \"Inyang\", or \"Ambrosia\" becomes \"Brosya\".\n\nComplementary to this is the practise of Anglicising (with the implication of \"modernising\") a Spanish given name. Thus \"José Roberto\" becomes \"Joseph Robert\" (further shortened to \"Joebert\"). \"Eduardo\" becomes \"Edward\" and then \"Eddie\" or \"Eddieboy\" (sometimes further shortened to \"Daboy\"). \"Consolación\" becomes \"Connie\"; \"Corazón\" becomes \"Cora\" or \"Cory\"; \"Juan\" becomes \"John\" or \"Johnny\"; \"Teresita\" or \"Teresa\" becomes \"Terê\", \"Tessa\", or \"Tessie\"; and \"Gracia\" becomes \"Grace\".\n\nThe variety of Filipino names, some of them with negative connotations in Anglicised form, often take foreigners by surprise. Most Filipinos don't notice any negative English connotations, however, unless somebody points it out.\n\nMany Filipino celebrities and high-status personalities, such as actors and politicians, don't mind having such types of nicknames; in fact, their nicknames are often more well-known than their actual given names. Film and television celebrity German Moreno didn't mind using the nickname \"Kuya Germs\" (\"kuya\" = elder brother). National Artist of the Philippines for Fashion Design, José \"Pitoy\" Moreno, would never be recognized anywhere under his official given name, but so far, he is the only prominent \"Pitoy\" in the world.\n\nIt is very common for parents to combine their given names to create a name for their child. Examples:\n\nChristians (as well as certain Muslims, Chinese Filipinos, and others) in the Philippines formerly followed naming patterns practiced throughout the Spanish-speaking world (the practice of having the father's surname followed by the mother's surname, the two being connected by the particle \"y\", which means \"and\", such as \"Guillermo Cu-Unjieng y Araullo\"). If the second surname starts with \"i\", \"y\", \"hi\" or \"hy\", the particle becomes \"e\", following Spanish rules of euphony, as in \"Eduardo Dato e Iradier\". Sometimed this second rule is overlooked.\n\nThis practice changed when the Philippines became a United States colony in the early 20th century. The order was reversed to follow the conventional American form \"Christian name - Middle name -\nSurname,\" which in this case is actually \"Christian name - Mother's surname - Father's surname\" (Francisco Concepcion Casas or simply Francisco C. Casas). The conjunction \"y\" was dropped, although it is still used in certain contexts today (most notably names in criminal records, like the names used in placards used in mug shots, such as shown in the image on the right).\n\nCurrently, the middle name is usually, though not always, the mother's maiden name (followed by the last name which is the father's surname). This is the opposite of what is done in Spanish-speaking countries and is similar to the way surnames are done in Portugal and Brazil. The blending of American and Spanish naming customs results in the way Filipinos write their names today.\n\nFurthermore, application forms for various legal documents define the first name as the \"Christian name(s),\" the middle name as the \"mother's maiden surname\" (this becomes the basis for the middle initial), and the surname as the \"father's surname.\"\n\nBearing the mother's maiden surname as the middle name or middle initial is more important to a majority of Filipinos than to use one of the given names as a middle name or middle initial. Filipino culture usually allocates equal value to the lineage from both mother and father except in some prominent families who practice a strictly patriarchal system (usually of Spanish or Chinese heritage).\n\nExceptions apply in the case of children with single parents. Children born out of wedlock are registered under the mother's maiden name (if still unmarried), applying her middle name (maternal surname) for the child's last name, respectively. The unmarried father must resort to legal and administrative procedures if he desires to acknowledge the child as his own and for the child to be registered with his own surname (in which case the child will use the mother's surname as his/her middle name). Likewise, children raised by single fathers take the current surname (paternal surname) with no middle name, whether or not the mother's identity is known. These exceptions also apply to Filipino children who have non-Filipino descent.\n\nWhen a woman marries, she may: use her maiden first name and surname and add her husband's surname; use her maiden first name and her husband's surname; or use her husband’s full name, but prefixing a word indicating that she is his wife, such as “Mrs.” She may also decline to adopt her husband's surname and continue to use her maiden name since there is no law in the Philippines which obligates a married woman to use the surname of her husband.\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, it was common for married Filipino women to insert the particle \"de\" (\"of\") between her maiden surname and husband's surname (as in \"Margarita Mangahas de Cuyegkeng\" or \"Margarita M. de Cuyegkeng\"), another common Spanish naming custom. However, this practice is no longer common.\n\nMarried Filipino women who are professionals may choose to hyphenate their surnames (such as \"Margarita Margarita - Cuyegkeng\", instead of simply \"Margarita Cuyegkeng\" or \"Margarita M. Cuyegkeng\"), at least in professional use, and use it socially even if legal documents follow a different naming pattern. This practice allows others to identify them after their marriage and helps others keep track of their professional achievements; otherwise, her unmarried and married names would seem to refer to two different persons (\"Margarita Gomez Mangahas\" as compared to \"Margarita Mangahas-Cuyegkeng\").\n\nBefore digitization of records, middle initials and sorting of surnames follow the first letter of the name after Hispanic \"de\", \"dela\", \"del\", \"delos\". For example, the name \"Jose delos Santos dela Cruz\" is shortened as \"Jose S. dela Cruz\" and surname sorted on the letter C. Today, the middle initial must be the letter D (\"Jose D. dela Cruz\") and surname sorted in the letter D.\n\nThough most Filipinos adopted Spanish surnames, some chose surnames that derive from words in local languages, like Tagalog, Visayan (Cebuano and Hiligaynon), Ilocano, Kapampangan and Pangasinan. Many indigenous surnames derive from words displaying qualities of people, especially those related to strength (e.g. Tagalog \"Macaraeg\" and \"Panganiban\"), defiance (e.g. Tagalog \"Dimayuga\") or settlement (e.g. Cebuano/Hiligaynon \"Magbanua\"). Most indigenous surnames have traditional spellings altered to follow Spanish orthography rules, therefore obscuring their meanings.\n\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of several common surnames from native Filipino languages. Variant surnames are listed beside their original forms. Language of origin are given in parentheses. \n\n\n\n\nUnlike their lowlander counterparts, Igorots living in the Cordillera Central in northern Luzon were not conquered by the Spaniards, thereby preserving their naming customs from foreign influence. Each group had their own naming customs, but generally, like Indonesian names, there is only one given name and no surname to speak of. The given name's meaning is usually connected to natural phenomena or objects, such as \"danum\" for water. It was only the Igorots who have had interacted with Spaniards and lowlanders for trade who were given a name that follows the binomial \"first name\"-\"surname\" system, such as Mateo Cariño and Mateo Carantes.\n\nIt was only at the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the American occupation of the Philippines that the naming customs of the Igorots slowly conformed with the national legal naming system used to today, aided by the evangelization efforts of American Protestant missionaries. Most older people, however, still keep the singular given name given to them by their parents while also using the so-called \"Christian names\" to conform to Philippine law. The singular given names of some individuals living in the early 20th century have since been adopted as a surname by their descendants.\n\nAlmost all Filipinos had Spanish or Spanish-sounding surnames imposed on them for taxation purposes, but a number of them have indigenous Filipino surnames. On 21 November 1849, Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa issued a decree stating that Filipinos should adopt Spanish surnames to make census counting easier. Some Filipinos retained their native pre-colonial names, especially those who were exempted from the Clavería decree such as the descendants of rulers of the \"Maharlika\" or noble class. These surnames of the native nobility include Lacandola, Macapagal, Macabulos, and Tupas whom each descended from different Datus. They were allowed to keep the name to claim tax exemptions.\n\nThe Spanish surname category provides the most common surnames in the Philippines. At the course of time, some Spanish surnames were altered (with some eventually diverged/displaced their original spelling), as resulted from illiteracy among the poor and farming class bearing such surnames, creating confusion in the civil registry and a sense of detachment from their better-off relatives. Except for the \"Ñ\", Filipino surnames from Spanish are written without accents from American influence.\n\nBelow is the list of common Spanish surnames, categorized by Spanish regional origins, with variation or altered renderings enclosed in the parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany modern-day Chinese Filipinos, mostly Hoklo, have last names with one syllable like Lim, Cheng, Lao, Ang, Lo, Chua, Ong, Chiu, Yan, Uy, Ching, Sin, Go, Tan, Yap, Cu, Ke, Wu, So, Yu, Dy, Khu and Sy. However, early Chinese Filipino families took on the complete name of their patriarch, thus their names had three syllables. These were adopted into the mainstream Filipino surnames and do not exist anywhere else in the world. Their names were transcribed using the Spanish orthography in effect during the 19th century.\n\nBelow is the list of common, single character Chinese surnames commonly borne by Filipino-Chinese:\n\n\nSome Filipinos bear Japanese surnames. They most likely indicate Japanese ancestry either from the many Japanese who settled during pre-colonial Philippines when it was separated among different nations (kingdoms, rajahnates, sultanates, tribes, etc.), colonial times, or more recently from World War II. During the Macapagal and Marcos administrations, only few Japanese Filipinos have entered military services and this was very limited due to the post-war prejudice and distrust of the Filipinos to the Japanese who were naturalized or to people with Japanese heritage. These people in military service during that time are descendants of World War II Japanese soldiers who were captured, pardoned and settled in the Philippines, or descended from pre-war immigrants who became economically successful in their ventures in the country, and married local Filipino women. Japanese migrants in the Philippines in the early 19th Century are categorically Issei, or \"first generation\", who have been born in Japan and migrated to the country or to other countries primarily to U.S, Brazil, Mexico and Peru; their descendants are either full-blooded Japanese who extend their descent categorically to Nisei and Sansei, or a generation of Filipino-Japanese with combined or Filipinized cultural practices and lifestyles less often categorized to both Nisei or Sansei. However, there's no official categorization of the generation of Japanese migrants unlike in U.S. and Brazil since post-war developments in the Filipino social landscape enabled them to be socially and economically integrated to the Filipino society, making their cultural practices and lifestyles fully Filipino and ignoring or obscuring their Japanese heritage.\n\nMore recent economic developments in both countries enabled exchanges of both peoples for various economic reasons, whether for employment, higher career opportunities, business expansions, or philanthropic ventures, thus a few Japanese expatriates making such ventures settled in the country today, marrying local Filipino women and raising a generation of Filipino-Japanese children taking their education in the Philippines and living in a mix of Filipino and Japanese cultural lifestyles.\n\nBelow is a list of a few Japanese surnames borne by some Filipino-Japanese:\n\n\nThese are the surnames of Filipinos of British and/or American heritage, as these surnames are both shared by the Americans and the British. But much of the Filipinos bearing these surnames were more descended from their American fathers or grandfathers, whom a handful of them settled in the Philippines before the Second World War. Today, with the recent influx of British expatriates who settled in the country and married local Filipino women gave rise of the modern generation of Filipino-British children.\n\n\nA number of Filipino-Germans, Filipino-Austrians, Filipino-Swiss and Filipino descendants of German Americans bear these surnames. Some have German surnames because of the immigration of the Jewish communities from Europe during the Commonwealth era in the Philippines. A few of the Filipinos with German heritage became television and film personalities since 1950s.\n\nBelow is the list of known German surnames borne by Filipinos of German heritage. Alternate or Hispanized spelling of surnames are provided in the parentheses.\n\n\nThe use of Arabic names is prominent among the Filipino Muslims. The country has Islamic influence from what are now Arabs, Persians, Malays, Indonesians, and Indians, who have traded with ancestors of Filipinos, and introduced Islam to the southern parts of the archipelago beginning in the 13th century. Some names, including Fátima, Omar, and Soraya, bear direct influence from Arab sources and Spanish ones, given the latter's period under Moorish rule. Filipino Muslims, or called \"Moros\" as how the Spaniards called them, also bear and maintain unique blend of indigenous Moro and Arabic surnames, some are registered with Spanish renderings. Among Maranao families, some Maranao surnames are often used as a given name to their children. Others may or might have borne surnames from their mothers, manifesting scant matrilineal practice.\n\nBelow a list of known Moro surnames, combining the surnames borne by Maranaos, Maguindanaos, Iranuns, and Tausugs. Alternate or Hispanized spellings are enclosed in the parentheses.\n\n\n\n\nFilipinos who hold middle or family names from other non-English-speaking nations also follow the conventions mentioned in this article, despite the proper naming customs that are followed in those nations. Such surnames indicate their foreign heritage, primarily due to the influx of migrants and workers from Europe and South Asia, and more recently from Middle East.\n\nBelow is a short list of known surnames of other foreign origins. Some of these surnames have their spelling altered over time, making their foreign origins or nationalities obscure and often hard to determine. Possible and apparent nationality or ethnicity of these surnames are enclosed in the parentheses:\n\n\n\n"}

She was the 2018 Democratic nominee for U.S. Representative from Texas's 23rd congressional district. Her opponent in the 2018 elections was incumbent Republican Will Hurd.\n\nRaised in San Antonio, Texas, Ortiz Jones attended college on an ROTC scholarship, after which she became a United States Air Force intelligence officer and eventually reached the rank of captain.\n\nOrtiz Jones grew up in Texas as the first-generation American daughter of a single mother, Victorina Ortiz, a Ilocano from Pangasinan, Philippines. Her mother emigrated to the U.S. and earned a teaching certificate.\n\nOrtiz Jones attended John Jay High School, serving on the student council. She earned a four-year Air Force ROTC scholarship, allowing her to enroll at Boston University. In 2003, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies and a master's degree in economics. A lesbian who came out to her mother at 15, Ortiz Jones served under the U.S. military's \"don't ask, don't tell” policy, where she was at risk of losing her ROTC scholarship if her sexual orientation became public knowledge.\n\nShe later earned a master's degree in military arts and sciences at the U.S. Army School of Advanced Military Studies of the United States Army Command and General Staff College.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Ortiz Jones joined the US Air Force as an intelligence officer and deployed to Iraq under the Bush administration. After three years of active duty and reaching the rank of captain, she returned to Texas in 2006, working for a consulting company while caring for her mother, who had colon cancer (from which she eventually recovered).\n\nOrtiz Jones then returned to working as an intelligence analyst for US Africa Command in Germany. In 2008, she joined the Defense Intelligence Agency, where she specialized in Latin American topics; ultimately she became a special adviser to the deputy director. In November 2016, she moved to the Executive Office of the President (then Barack Obama) to serve under the U.S. Trade Representative. Having previously served under presidents of both parties, Ortiz Jones continued in her role during the Trump administration until June 2017, when she left her role, telling the \"HuffPost\", \"The type of people that were brought in to be public servants were interested in neither the public nor the service...That, to me, was a sign that I'm going to have to serve in a different way.\" She returned to San Antonio to run for Congress, living in the house where she grew up.\n\nIn 2017, Ortiz Jones was the first Democrat to announce a challenge to Republican Representative Will Hurd in Texas's predominantly Hispanic 23rd congressional district, which includes much of the border between Texas and Mexico. Democrat Hillary Clinton won the district by three points in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and neither party has controlled the congressional seat for more than two consecutive terms since 2007.\n\nOrtiz Jones finished first in the March 6, 2018, Democratic primary, earning 41% of the vote in a field of five. Rick Treviño was second with 17.5%. Because no candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff election was held on May 22, which Ortiz Jones won. In the November 6 general election, Ortiz Jones faces Hurd in what has been called the most competitive congressional race in the state. As of June 30, Ortiz Jones had raised $2.2 million while Hurd had raised $2.4 million in addition to the $1.5 million with which he entered the race. With four months remaining, Ortiz Jones was approaching the district's record for election fundraising by a Democrat ($2.7 million).\n\nOrtiz Jones was endorsed by EMILY's List, the Asian American Action Fund, the Equality PAC, VoteVets and Victory Fund, as well as Wendy Davis and Khzir Khan.\n\nSome journalists named Ortiz Jones as part of several \"waves\" of candidates from various backgrounds running as Democrats in 2018, including women, LGBT people, and military veterans. A March 2018 \"Teen Vogue\" article noted that if elected, Ortiz Jones would be \"the first openly gay woman of color from Texas elected to Congress, as well as the first Iraq War veteran to represent Texas in Congress. She'd also be the first woman to represent Texas's 23rd Congressional district.\"\n\nOrtiz Jones said she believed healthcare reform would play a big role in the election.

After a number of years, he returned home, where he took work as a police officer, and embraced evangelical Christianity.\n\nDuring the 1990s, tensions flared up between indigenous inhabitants of Guadalcanal and immigrants from neighboring Malaita. Following the election of Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, militants, including those led by a newly radicalized Keke, began a campaign of intimidation and violence against Malaitan settlers. This, including Keke's 1998 raid of a police armory, led to the formation of the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and all out ethnic warfare in the islands.\n\nKeke views himself as a prophet, leading his people to their \"promised land\". He also claims that he had political backing for the start of the conflict from then-premier Ezekiel Alebua — who provided money, weapons, and ammunition for the GRA. This claim has been denied by Alebua, who calls Keke \"little more than a violent thug\".\n\nDuring the ensuing conflict, the MEF gained the upper hand, deposing the government and gaining control of most police forces; making them a \"de facto\" extension of the militias. Many of the militias opposed to the MEF struck a peace deal in late 2000, but Keke refused to sign, moving his soldiers into the jungles of the Weather Coast to avoid capture.\n\nThe GRA, under Keke's leadership, has been accused of a variety of crimes, including arson, kidnapping, assassination, and murder. Keke has been personally implicated in more than 50 murders, including that of cabinet minister and priest Augustine Geve, as well as seven missionaries from the Melanesian Brotherhood.\n\nIn late 2003, following the arrival of a multi-national intervention force led by Australia, Keke called for a cease-fire, and surrendered to peace-keepers. In 2005, he was convicted of the murder of Geve, and sentenced to life in prison.\n\n"}

At the end of the usual Jesuit spiritual and academic training he was ordained priest on 28 August 1927.\n\nHe travelled to Japan as a missionary in 1929 and became interested in that country's Buddhist practices. In 1940, he became the vicar of Hiroshima, and on 6 August 1945 he was critically wounded by the nuclear blast in that city, which is depicted in John Hersey's book \"Hiroshima\". Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany.\n\nIn September 1946, he had an audience with Pope Pius XII, in which he revealed his plan to build in Hiroshima a cathedral dedicated to the idea of world peace. Designed by Japanese architect Togo Murano, construction on the cathedral began in 1950 and on 6 August 1954, the Memorial Cathedral for World Peace（）was dedicated.\n\nIn 1956, Enomiya-Lassalle began studying Zen with Harada Daiun Sogaku.

Yamada was enthusiastic about the possibilities of Zen as a Christian practice, believing that \"Zen would become an important stream in the Catholic Church one day\". With Enomiya-Lassalle's active assistance, he attracted a number of Catholic priests and nuns as students. In the late 1960s, Enomiya-Lasalle was certified as a teacher in Yamada's Sanbo Kyodan sect and given the title \"roshi\" (Zen master), while professing his continued belief in Christianity. After 1968, Enomiya-Lassalle spent much of his time in Europe leading Zen retreats and encouraging Zen practice among Christians.

Houdon's subjects included Denis Diderot (1771), Benjamin Franklin (1778-09), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1778), Voltaire (1781), Molière (1781), George Washington (1785–88), Thomas Jefferson (1789), Louis XVI (1790), Robert Fulton, (1803–04), and Napoléon Bonaparte (1806).\n\nHe was born in Versailles, on 25 March 1741.\nIn 1752, he entered the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, where he studied with René-Michel Slodtz, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, and Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. From 1761 to 1764, he studied at the École royale des élèves protégés.\n\nHoudon won the Prix de Rome in 1761, but was not greatly influenced by ancient and Renaissance art in Rome. His stay in the city is marked by two characteristic and important productions: the superb écorché (1767), an anatomical model which has served as a guide to all artists since his day, and the statue of Saint Bruno in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome. \nAfter ten years stay in Italy, Houdon returned to Paris.\n\nHe submitted \"Morpheus\" to the Salon of 1771. He developed his practise of portrait busts.\nHe became a member of the Académie de peinture et de sculpture in 1771, and a professor in 1778. In 1778, he modeled Voltaire, producing a portrait bust with wig for the Comédie-Française; one for the Palace of Versailles, and one for Catherine the Great.\n\nIn 1778, he joined the masonic lodge Les Neuf Sœurs, where he later met Benjamin Franklin, and John Paul Jones.\nFor Salon of 1781, he submitted a \"Diana\" which was refused without drapery.\n\nHoudon's portrait sculpture of Washington was the result of a specific invitation by Benjamin Franklin to cross the Atlantic in 1785, specifically to visit Mount Vernon, so that Washington could model for him. Washington sat for wet clay life models and a plaster life mask. \nThese models served for many commissions of Washington, including the standing figure commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly, for the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond. \nNumerous variations of the Washington bust were produced, portraying him variously as a general in uniform, in the classical manner showing chest musculature, and as Roman Consul Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus clad in a toga. A cast of the latter is located in the Vermont State House.\n\nIn the 1780s Houdon produced two semi-nude sculptures, \"Winter\" and \"Bather\".\n\nPerceived as bourgeois for his connections to the court of Louis XVI, he fell out of favour during the French Revolution, although he escaped imprisonment. \nHoudon returned to favor during the French Consulate and Empire, being taken on as one of the original artistic team for what became the Column of the Grande Armée at Wimille.\nHe was made a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur, on 17 December 1804.\n\nHoudon died in Paris on 15 July 1828, and was interred at the Cimetière du Montparnasse.\n\nOn 1 July 1786, he married Marie-Ange-Cecile Langlois; they had three daughters: Sabine, Anne-Ange, and Claudine.\n\nHoudon's sculptures were used as models for the engravings used on various U.S. postage stamps of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which depict Washington in profile.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1913 during the Dublin Lock-out, she worked in the soup kitchen in Liberty Hall. She subsequently joined the Irish Citizen Army (ICA). In the Easter Rising she worked in a first aid tent. She was arrested following the Rising but released the following month. She joined Sinn Féin and was elected to Rathmines District Council in 1920.\n\nMadeleine ffrench-Mullen was born on 30 December 1880 in Malta, where her father, St Lawrence ffrench-Mullen, a Royal Navy surgeon, was stationed. She had two brothers, St Lawrence Patrick Joseph (1890–1891) and Douglas (1893–1943).\n\nffrench-Mullen's interest in politics started young, Her father was a committed Parnellite and their Dundrum home was a campaign headquarters. She was a radical feminist and republican during her life. Like many other of the time she regarded it as a woman's right to vote. She joined the suffrage movement, and met women with a similar worldview and values. The women's suffrage movement was included in the Movements of Extremists reports of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. ffrench-Mullen went on to join Inghinidhe na hÉireann, a radical nationalist women's group founded by Maud Gonne in 1900. The organisation developed into Cumann na mBan in 1913. Suffragist values were central to Cumann na mBan's goal of standing side-by-side with men in the fight for the Irish Republic. Some members saw this as women regaining the rights that had belonged to them in pre-invasion Gaelic civilisation. ffrench-Mullen was on the socialist wing of the moment, holding to the ideals of universal social equality of the syndicalist James Connolly and the Irish Citizen Army.\n\nDuring the Easter Rising of 1916, ffrench-Mullen served as a lieutenant in the Irish Citizen Army. She saw action with the St Stephen's Green and Royal College of Surgeons garrison. In St Stephen's Green she was in command of the 15 Citizen Army women who set up a medical station and field kitchen. While occupying St Stephen's Green, she and her comrades came under sustained heavy fire from the Shellbourne Hotel and buildings on the north side of the Green. After the surrender of the College of Surgeons garrison ffrench-Mullen was one of the 77 women who had fought in the Rising who were imprisoned, among them her close friend Dr Kathleen Lynn. While in captivity ffrench Mullen was moved three times, spending time in Richmond Barracks, Kilmainham Gaol and Mountjoy Jail. She was released on 5 June 1916.\n\nffrench-Mullen met Kathleen Lynn through Inghinidhe na h-Éireann. She moved into Lynn's Belgrave Road, Rathmines home in 1915, and they shared a life until ffrench-Mullen's death in 1944, living together in Rathmines for 30 years.\n\nffrench-Mullen recorded in her prison diary in 1916 that she could face prison without fear once Lynn (whom she referred to as \"the Doctor\") and she were together. Katherine Lynch of the Women's Studies Centre at University College Dublin describes them as partners, calling them part of a network of lesbians living in Dublin—which included Helena Molony, Louie Bennett and Elizabeth O'Farrell—who met through the suffrage movement and later became involved with the national and trade union movement. \n\nMadeleine ffrench-Mullen and Kathleen Lynn established Saint Ultan's Children's Hospital, also known as \"Teach Ultan\", was a female-run hospital for infants at 37 Charlemont Street, Dublin in 1919. The hospital focused on children's health and wellbeing, an area that was perceived at the time as women's concern. In the aftermath of WW1 many health problems had arisen including a rise in venereal diseases such as syphilis, carried from soldiers returning home from war. Many of Ireland's infants of the time suffered from congenital syphilis (inherited disease from mother at birth) this was a driving factor in the opening of St Ultan's hospital. Tuberculosis was endemic in Ireland during its time as a British colony. Against steadfast opposition by the State and the Catholic Church, Lynn and ffrench Mullen established a vaccination project, vaccinating thousands of impoverished children who would certainly have succumbed to TB without their vaccines. Their success led to the foundation of Ireland's BCG programme, which has vaccinated all babies since the 1950s.\n\nMadeleine ffrench-Mullen died in a Dublin nursing home on 26 May 1944, aged 63. She is interred with her parents, St Lawrence (1846–1895) and Margaret (1857–1912), as well as her younger brothers (whom she outlived), St Lawrence Patrick Joseph (1890–1891) and Douglas (1893–1943), in the ffrench-Mullen family plot in Glasnevin Cemetery. Her funeral took place on the same day as the 1944 General Election. Lynn died in 1955 and is interred in Deans Grange Cemetery.\n"}

{"id": "3159008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3159008", "title": "Petro Poroshenko", "text": "Petro Poroshenko\n\nPetro Oleksiyovych Poroshenko (, ; born 26 September 1965) is the fifth and current President of Ukraine (excluding acting president Oleksandr Turchynov), in office since 2014. He served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2009 to 2010, and as the Minister of Trade and Economic Development in 2012. From 2007 until 2012, Poroshenko headed the Council of Ukraine's National Bank.\n\nOutside government, Poroshenko has been a prominent Ukrainian oligarch with a lucrative career in acquiring and building assets. His most recognized brands are Roshen, the large-scale confectionery company which has earned him the nickname of 'Chocolate King', and the TV channel \"5 kanal\", an all-news national TV broadcaster. Due to the scale of his business holdings in the manufacturing, agriculture and financial sectors, his political influence that included several stints at government prior to his presidency, and ownership of an influential mass-media outlet, Poroshenko has long been considered one of the prominent Ukrainian oligarchs even though not the most influential among them.\n\nHe was elected president on 25 May 2014, capturing more than 54% of the vote in the first round, thereby winning outright and avoiding a run-off.\n\nPoroshenko was born in the city of Bolhrad, in Odessa Oblast, on 26 September 1965 to Oleksij Ivanovich Poroshenko and Evgenia Sergeevna (née Grigorchuk). His father, , was an engineer and later government official who managed several factories during the Soviet rule in Ukraine. Little is known about his mother but a Ukrainian newspaper said she was an accountant, who taught at a vocational and technical school of accounting. He also spent his childhood and youth in Bendery (Moldavian SSR, now under \"de facto\" control of the unrecognized breakaway state Transnistria). where his father Oleksij was heading a machine building plant.\n\nIn his youth, Poroshenko practiced judo and sambo, and was a Candidate for Master of Sport of the USSR. Despite good grades he was not awarded the normal gold medal at graduation, and on his report card he was given a \"C\" for his behavior. After getting into a fight with four Soviet Army cadets at the military commissariat, he was sent to army service in the distant Kazakh SSR.\n\nIn 1989, Poroshenko graduated, having started studying in 1982, with a degree in economics from the international relations and law department (subsequently the Institute of International Relations) at the Kiev State University. At this university he was friends with Mikheil Saakashvili who he in May 2015 would appoint as Governor of the Odessa Oblast (region) and who is a former President of Georgia .\n\nIn 1984 Poroshenko married a medical student, Maryna Perevedentseva (born 1962). Their first son, Oleksiy, was born in 1985 (his three other children were born in 2000 and 2001).\n\nFrom 1989 to 1992 Poroshenko was an assistant at the university's international economic relations department. While still a student, he founded a legal advisory firm mediating the negotiation of contracts in foreign trade, and then he undertook the negotiations himself, starting to supply cocoa beans to the Soviet chocolate industry in 1991. At the same time, he was deputy director of the 'Republic' Union of Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs, and the CEO \"Exchange House Ukraine\".\n\nPoroshenko's brother, Mykhailo, older by eight years, died in a 1997 car accident under mysterious circumstances.\n\nIn 1993, Poroshenko, together with his father Oleksiy and colleagues from the Road Traffic Institute in Kiev, created the UkrPromInvest Ukrainian Industry and Investment Company, which specialized in the confectionery and automotive industries (as well as in other agricultural processing later on.) Poroshenko was director-general of the company from its founding until 1998, when in connection with his entry into parliament he handed the title over to his father, while retaining the title of honorary president.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, UkrPromInvest acquired control over several state-owned confectionery enterprises which were combined into the Roshen group in 1996, creating the largest confectionery manufacturing operation in Ukraine. His business success in this industry earned him the nickname \"Chocolate King\". Poroshenko's business empire also includes several car and bus factories, Kuznya na Rybalskomu shipyard, the 5 Kanal television channel, as well as other businesses in Ukraine.\n\nAlthough not the most prominent in the list of his business holdings, the assets that drew much recent media attention, and often controversy, are the confectionery factory in Lipetsk, Russia, that became controversial due to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present), the Sevastopol Marine Plant (Sevmorzavod) that has been confiscated after the 2014 Russian forcible annexation of Crimea and the media outlet 5 kanal, particularly because of Poroshenko's repeated refusal to sell an influential media asset following his accession to presidency.\n\nAccording to Poroshenko (and Rothschild Wealth Management & Trust) since becoming President of Ukraine he has relinquished the management of his businesses, ultimately (in January 2016) to a blind trust.\n\nIn March 2012, \"Forbes\" placed him on the Forbes list of billionaires at 1,153rd place, with $1 billion USD. As of May 2015, Poroshenko's net worth was about $720 million USD (Bloomberg estimate), losing 25 percent of his wealth because of Russia's ban of Roshen products and the state of the Ukrainian economy.\n\nAccording to the annual ranking of the richest people in Ukraine published by the Ukrainian journal Novoye Vremya and conducted jointly with Dragon Capital, a leading investment company in Ukraine, published in October 2015, president Poroshenko was found to be the only one from the top ten list whose asset value grew since the previous year's ranking. The estimate of his assets was set at $979 million USD, a 20% growth, and his ranking increased from 9th to 6th wealthiest person in Ukraine. The article noted that Poroshenko remained one of the only two European leaders who owned a business empire of such scale, with Silvio Berlusconi of Italy being the other.\n\nA total of €450 million is kept in an Amsterdam-based company registered in Cyprus, as a result of which his effective tax rate is 5% rather than the statutory tax rate of 18% in Ukraine. The company is likely to be worth much more, as the annual accounts published by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce only contain the book value of the shares, which is very likely to be lower than the market value.\n\nA number of businesses were once part of the which Poroshenko headed in 1993–1998. The investment group was dissolved in April 2012. Poroshenko has stated that upon beginning his political activity he passed on his holdings to a trust fund.\n\n\nPoroshenko first won a seat in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament) in 1998 for the 12th single-mandate constituency. He was initially a member of the United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (SDPU), the party led by Viktor Medvedchuk and loyal to president Leonid Kuchma at the time. Poroshenko left SDPU(o) in 2000 to create an independent left-of-center faction and then a party, naming it Party of Ukraine's Solidarity (PSU). In 2001 Poroshenko was instrumental in creating the Party of Regions, also loyal to Kuchma; the Party of Ukraine's Solidarity having merged into the Party of Regions, Poroshenko launched a new party with a similar name, the party \"Solidarity.\n\nIn December 2001 Poroshenko broke ranks with Kuchma supporters to become campaign chief of Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine Bloc opposition faction. After parliamentary elections in March 2002 in which Our Ukraine won the biggest share of the popular vote and Poroshenko won a seat in parliament, Poroshenko served as head of the parliamentary budget committee, where he was accused of \"misplacing 47 million hryvnias\" (USD$8.9 million). As a consequence of Poroshenko's Our Ukraine Bloc membership tax inspectors launched an attack on his business. Despite great difficulties, UkrPromInvest managed to survive until Yushchenko became President of Ukraine in 2005.\n\nPoroshenko was considered a close confidant of Yushchenko, who is the godfather of Poroshenko's daughters. Poroshenko was likely the wealthiest oligarch among Yushchenko supporters, and was often named as one of the main financial backers of Our Ukraine and the Orange Revolution. After Yushchenko won the presidential elections in 2004, Poroshenko was appointed Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.\n\nIn September 2005, highly publicized mutual allegations of corruption erupted between Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko involving the privatizations of state-owned firms. Poroshenko, for example, was accused of defending the interests of Viktor Pinchuk, who had acquired state firm Nikopol Ferroalloy for $80 million, independently valued at $1 billion.\nIn response to the allegations, Yushchenko dismissed his entire cabinet of ministers, including Poroshenko and Tymoshenko. State prosecutors dismissed an abuse of power investigation against Poroshenko the following month, immediately after Yushchenko dismissed Svyatoslav Piskun, General Prosecutor of Ukraine. Piskun claimed that he was sacked because he refused to institute criminal proceedings against Tymoshenko and refused to drop proceedings against Poroshenko.\n\nIn the March 2006 parliamentary election Poroshenko was re-elected to the Ukrainian parliament with the support of Our Ukraine electoral bloc. He chaired the parliamentary Committee on Finance and Banking. Allegedly, since Poroshenko claimed the post of Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament for himself, the Socialist Party of Ukraine chose to be part of the Alliance of National Unity because it was promised that their party leader, Oleksandr Moroz, would be elected chairman if the coalition were formed. This left Poroshenko's Our Ukraine and their ally Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc out of the Government.\n\nPoroshenko did not run in the September 2007 parliamentary election. Poroshenko started heading the Council of Ukraine's National Bank in February 2007. Between 1999 and 2012 he was a board member of the National Bank of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Yushchenko nominated Poroshenko for Foreign Minister on 7 October 2009. Poroshenko was appointed by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) on 9 October 2009. On 12 October 2009, President Yushchenko re-appointed Poroshenko to the National Security and Defense Council. Poroshenko supported Ukrainian NATO-membership. However, he also stated NATO membership should not be a goal in itself. Although Poroshenko was dismissed as foreign minister on 11 March 2010, President Viktor Yanukovych expressed hope for further cooperation with him.\n\nIn late February 2012 Poroshenko was named as the new Minister of Trade and Economic Development in the Azarov Government; on 9 March 2012 President Yanukovych stated he wanted Poroshenko to work in the government in the post of economic development and trade minister. On 23 March 2012 Poroshenko was appointed economic development and trade minister of Ukraine by Yanukovych. The same month he stepped down as head of the Council of Ukraine's National Bank.\n\nPoroshenko claims that he became Minister of Trade and Economic Development in order to help bring Ukraine closer to the EU and get Yulia Tymoshenko released from prison. After he took the post, tax inspectors launched an attack on his business.\n\nPoroshenko returned to the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) after the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election after winning (with more than 70%) as an independent candidate in single-member district number 12 (first-past-the-post wins a parliamentary seat) located in Vinnytsia Oblast. He did not enter any faction in parliament and became member of the committee on European Integration. Poroshenko's father Oleksiy did intend to take part in the elections too in single-member district number 16 (also located in Vinnytsia Oblast), but withdrew his candidacy for health reasons. In mid-February 2013, Poroshenko hinted he would run for Mayor of Kiev in the 2013 Kiev mayoral election.\n\nIn 2013 the registration certificate of Solidarity was cancelled because for more than 10 years had not participated in any election. Poroshenko then launched and became leader of the National Alliance of freedom and Ukrainian patriotism \"OFFENSIVE\" (NASTUP), which was renamed \"All-Ukrainian Union Solidarity\" (BOS).\n\nDuring the Euromaidan protests, between November 2013 and February 2014, Poroshenko actively supported the protest, including with financial support. This led to an upsurge of his popularity. He did not participate in negotiations between then President Yanukovych and the Euromaidan parliamentary opposition parties Batkivshchyna, Svoboda and UDAR.\n\nIn an interview with Lally Weymouth, Poroshenko said: \"From the beginning, I was one of the organizers of the Maidan. My television channel — Channel 5 — played a tremendously important role. ... At that time, Channel 5 started to broadcast, there were just 2,000 people on the Maidan. But during the night, people went by foot — seven, eight, nine, 10 kilometers — understanding this is a fight for Ukrainian freedom and democracy. In four hours, almost 30,000 people were there.\" The BBC reported, \"Mr Poroshenko owns 5 Kanal TV, the most popular news channel in Ukraine, which showed clear pro-opposition sympathies during the months of political crisis in Kiev.\"\n\nPoroshenko refused to join the Yatsenyuk Government (although he introduced his colleague Volodymyr Groysman, the mayor of Vinnytsia, into it), nor did he join any of the two newly created parliamentary factions Economic Development and Sovereign European Ukraine.\n\nOn 24 April 2014 Poroshenko visited Luhansk, at the time not controlled by Ukrainian authorities. Just like previously in Crimea he was met by a blockade of hundreds of pro-Russian locals at Luhansk Airport. Poroshenko later claimed: \"When I traveled to Luhansk Oblast, my car was fired at and there was an attempt to take our entire group hostage.\"\n\nFollowing the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the resulting removal of Viktor Yanukovych from the office of President of Ukraine, new presidential elections were scheduled to take place on 25 May 2014. In pre-election polls from March 2014, Poroshenko garnered the most support of all the prospective candidates, with one poll conducted by SOCIS giving him a rating of over 40%. On 29 March he stated that he would run for president; at the same time Vitali Klitschko left the presidential contest, choosing to support Poroshenko's bid.\n\nOn 2 April Poroshenko stated, \"If I am elected, I will be honest and sell the Roshen Concern.\" He also said in early April that the level of popular support for the idea of Ukraine's joining NATO was too small to put on the agenda \"so as not to ruin the country.\" He also vowed not to sell his 5 Kanal television channel. On 14 April, Poroshenko publicly endorsed the campaign of Jarosław Gowin's party Poland Together of neighboring Poland in this year's elections to the European Parliament, thanking Gowin's party colleague Paweł Kowal for supporting Ukraine.\n\nPoroshenko's election slogan was: \"Live in a new way – Poroshenko!\". \n\nOn 29 May, the Central Election Commission of Ukraine announced that Poroshenko had won 25 May presidential election, with 54.7% of the votes.\n\nDuring his visit in Berlin, Poroshenko stated that separatists \"don't represent anybody. We have to restore law and order and sweep the terrorists off the street.\" He described as \"fake\" a planned 11 May Donbass status referendums.\n\nWhen it became clear he had won the election on election day evening (on 25 May 2014) Poroshenko announced \"My first presidential trip will be to Donbas\", where armed pro-Russian rebels had declared the separatist republics Donetsk People's Republic and Lugansk People's Republic and control a large part of the region. Poroshenko also vowed to continue the military operations by the Ukrainian government forces to end the armed insurgency claiming \"The anti-terrorist operation cannot and should not last two or three months. It should and will last hours.\" He compared the armed pro-Russian rebels to Somali pirates. Poroshenko also called for negotiations with Russia in the presence of international intermediaries. Russia responded by saying it did not need an intermediary in its bilateral relations with Ukraine. As president-elect Poroshenko promised to return Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in March 2014. He also vowed to hold new parliamentary elections in 2014.\n\nPoroshenko was inaugurated in the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) on 7 June 2014. In his inaugural address he stressed that Ukraine would not give up Crimea and stressed the unity of Ukraine. He promised an amnesty \"for those who do not have blood on their hands\" to the separatist and pro-Russia insurgents of the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine and to the Ukrainian nationalist groups that oppose them, but added: \"Talking to gangsters and killers is not our path\". He also called for early regional elections in Eastern Ukraine. Poroshenko also stated that he would sign the economic part of the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement and that this was the first step towards full Ukrainian EU Membership. During the speech he stated he saw \"Ukrainian as the only state language\" but also spoke of the \"guarantees [of] the unhindered development of Russian and all the other languages\". Part of the speech was in Russian.\nThe inauguration was attended by about 50 foreign delegations, including US Vice President Joe Biden, President of Poland Bronisław Komorowski, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, President of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of Switzerland and the OSCE Chairman-in-Office Didier Burkhalter, President of Germany Joachim Gauck, President of Georgia Giorgi Margvelashvili, Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán, President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, the OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feldman, China's Minister of Culture Cai Wu and Ambassador of Russia to Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov Former Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko was also present. After the inauguration ceremony Tymoshenko said about Poroshenko \"I think Ukraine has found a very powerful additional factor of stability\".\n\nAt the time of his inauguration, armed pro-Russian rebels, after disputed referendums, had declared the independence of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic and Lugansk People's Republic and controlled a large part of Eastern Ukraine, but were largely considered to be illegitimate by the international community. After the inauguration, Poroshenko launched a \"peace\" plan envisioned to garner the recognition of the presidential elections in Ukraine by Russia, consisting of a cease-fire with the separatists (named \"terrorists\" by Poroshenko himself) and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor for civilians (\"who are not involved in the conflict\"). Poroshenko warned that he had a \"Plan B\" if the initial peace plan was rejected.\n\nIn mid-June Poroshenko started the process of amending Ukraine's constitution to achieve Ukraine's administrative decentralization. According to Poroshenko (on 16 June 2014) this was \"a key element of the peace plan\". In his draft constitutional amendments of June 2014 proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions (replacing the current oblasts), districts and \"hromadas\" (united territorial communities). In these amendments he also proposed that \"Village, city, district and regional administrations will be able to determine the status of the Russian language and other national minority languages of Ukraine in accordance with the procedure established by the law and within the borders of their administrative and territorial units\". He proposed that Ukrainian remained the only state language of Ukraine. Poroshenko further proposed to create the post of presidential representatives who would supervise the enforcement of the Ukrainian constitution and laws and the observation of human rights and freedoms in oblasts and raions/raions of cities. In case of an \"emergency situation or martial law regime\" they will \"guide and organize\" in the territories they are stationed in. Batkivshchyna, a key coalition partner in the Yatsenyuk Government, came out against the plan. \n\nHe has repeatedly spoken out against federalization. and does not seek to increase his presidential powers.\n\n1 July 2015 decentralization draft law gave local authorities the right to oversee how their tax revenues are spent. The draft law did not give an autonomous status to Donbass, as demanded by the pro-Russian rebels there, but gave the region partial self-rule for three years.\n\nOn 25 August 2014, Poroshenko called a snap election to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament), to be held 26 October 2014. According to him this was necessary \"to purify the Rada of the mainstay of [former president] Viktor Yanukovych\". These deputies, Poroshenko said, \"clearly do not represent the people who elected them\". Poroshenko also said that these Rada deputies were responsible for \"the [January 2014] Dictatorship laws that took the lives of the Heavenly hundred\". Poroshenko also stated that many of the (then) current MPs were \"direct sponsors and accomplices or at least sympathizers of militant-separatists\".\n\nPoroshenko had pressed for the elections since his victory in the May 2014 presidential election.\n\nOn 27 August 2014, the party congress of All-Ukrainian Party of Peace and Unity adopted a new name: \"Petro Poroshenko Bloc\" (BPP). In 2015, the Petro Poroshenko Bloc was renamed in \"Petro Poroshenko Bloc \"Solidarity\"\".\n\nOn 13 December 2014 Poroshenko stated that he did not want Ukraine to become a nuclear power again.\n\nOn 15 May 2015 Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of streets and other public places and settlements with a name related to Communism. According to Poroshenko \"I did what I had to\"; adding\n\"Ukraine as a state has done its job, then historians should work, while the government should take care of the future\". Poroshenko believes that the communist repression and holodomor of the Soviet Union are on par with the Nazi crimes of the 1940s. The legislation (Poroshenko signed on 15 May 2015) also provides \"public recognition to anyone who fought for Ukrainian independence in the 20th century\", including the controversial Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) combatants led by Roman Shukhevych and Stepan Bandera.\n\nPoroshenko said in an interview with Germany's \"Bild\" newspaper that \"If I am elected, I'll wipe the slate clean and will sell the Roshen concern. As president of Ukraine, I will and want to only focus on the well-being of the nation.\"\n\nOn 23 March 2015 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accepted the resignation of billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky as governor of Dnipro region over the control of oil companies. \"There will be no more oligarchs in Ukraine,\" Poroshenko said adding that \"oligarchs must pay more [taxes] than the middle class and more than small business.\" The president underscored that \"the program of de-oligarchization will be put into life\". Poroshenko promised that he will fight against the Ukrainian oligarchs.\n\nCorruption is a widespread and growing problem in Ukrainian society. Poroshenko has signed a decree to create the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine to comply with the requirements of the International Monetary Fund.\n\nOn 7 December 2015 Poroshenko had a meeting with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden in Kiev to discuss Ukrainian-American cooperation. He met Donald Trump in June 2017; the BBC accused him of paying Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen between 400,000 and 600,000 dollars to organize this meeting.\n\nIn June 2014 Poroshenko forbade any cooperation with Russia in the military sphere.\n\nAt the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 26 June 2014 Poroshenko stated that bilateral relations with Russia cannot be normalized unless Russia undoes its unilateral annexation of Crimea and returns its control of Crimea to Ukraine.\n\nOn Poroshenko's June 2014 Peace plan for Eastern Ukraine Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov commented \"it looks like an ultimatum\".\n\nOn 26 August 2014 Poroshenko met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Minsk where Putin called on Ukraine not to escalate its offensive. Poroshenko responded by demanding Russia halt its supplying of arms to separatist fighters. He said his country wanted a political compromise and promised the interests of Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine would be considered.\n\nThe European Union (EU) and Ukraine signed the economic part of the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement on 27 June 2014. Poroshenko stated that the day was \"Ukraine's most historic day since independence in 1991\", describing it as a \"symbol of faith and unbreakable will\". He saw the signing as the start of preparations for Ukrainian EU Membership.\n\nAt his speech at the opening session of the new parliament on 27 November 2014 Poroshenko stated \"we've decided to return to the course of NATO integration\" because \"the nonalignment status of Ukraine proclaimed in 2010 couldn't guarantee our security and territorial integrity\". The Ukrainian parliament on 23 December 2014 voted 303 to 8 to repeal a 2010 bill that had made Ukraine a non-aligned state in a bill submitted by Poroshenko. On 29 December 2014 Poroshenko vowed to hold a referendum on joining NATO. On 22 September 2015 Poroshenko claimed that \"Russia's aggressive actions\" proved need for the enlargement of NATO and that the Ukrainian referendum on joining NATO would be held after \"every condition for the Ukrainian compliance with NATO membership criteria\" was met by \"reforming our country\".\nOn 2 February 2017, in an interview with Funke Mediengruppe, Poroshenko announced he was planning a referendum on whether Ukraine should join NATO.\n\nPoroshenko was criticized by Committee to Protect Journalists for signing a decree which banned 41 international journalists and bloggers from entering Ukraine for one year, being labeled as threats to national security. The list includes three BBC journalists, and two Spanish journalists currently missing in Syria, all of whom previously covered the Ukraine crisis.\n\nPoroshenko set up an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands during the peak of the war in Donbass. Leaked documents from the Panama Papers show that Poroshenko registered the company, Prime Asset Partners Ltd, on 21 August 2014. Records in Cyprus show him as the firm's only shareholder. He said that he had done nothing wrong, and the legal firm, Avellum, overseeing the sale of Roshen, Poroshenko's confectionery company, said that \"any allegations of tax evasion are groundless\". The anti-corruption group Transparency International believes that the \"creation of businesses while serving as president is a direct violation of the constitution\".\n\nHis name was cited in the list of politicians named in \"Paradise Papers\" allegations.\n\nPoroshenko has been married to Maryna since 1984. The couple have four children: Olexiy (born 1985), the twins Yevheniya and Oleksandra (born 2000) and Mykhaylo (born 2001). Olexiy was a representative in the regional parliament of Vinnytsia Oblast. In November 2014, he became People's Deputy of Ukraine. Maryna Poroshenko is a cardiologist, who does not take part in public life, apart from her participation in the activities of the Petro Poroshenko Charity Foundation. Poroshenko became a grandfather on the day of his presidential inauguration of 7 June 2014.\n\nPoroshenko is a member of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Poroshenko has financed the restoration of its buildings and monasteries. In high-level meetings he is often seen with a crucifix.\n\nPoroshenko speaks fluent Ukrainian, Russian, English and Romanian.\n\nPetro Poroshenko is diabetic.\n\nHe was also nicknamed 'Chocolate King' because of his ownership of a large confectionery business. Poroshenko objected to being called an oligarch, stating that \"Oligarchs are people who seek power in order to further enrich themselves. But I have long fought against bandits who are robbing our country and have destroyed free enterprise\".\n\nAfter promising during his election campaign to sell his business assets when elected as the president of Ukraine, according to Poroshenko (and Rothschild Wealth Management & Trust) since becoming President of Ukraine he has relinquished the management of his businesses, ultimately (in January 2016) to a blind trust.\n\nDuring his speeches Petro Poroshenko on numerous occasions has called the war in East Ukraine a 'Patriotic War', yet did not initiate implementation of martial law, for which he was criticized on numerous occasions by politicians and the general public. Poroshenko noted that it is necessary to realize the consequences of martial law for the country:\n\nA month later the last statement was refuted by a head of the IMF Ukrainian branch Jerome Vacher, \"As for the possible introduction of martial law, the IMF has no formal legal restrictions that impede continuation of mutual cooperation under such conditions. We have already worked with a number of countries where war conflicts of various intensity unfolded\".\n\nOn 5 February 2015 in his interview with the Spanish El Pais, Poroshenko stated that he will introduce martial law in the case of an escalation of the situation in Donbas, but that that decision will limit democracy and liberties as well as threaten the development of the economy.\nPoroshenko stands after the murder of journalist Olesy Buzina.\n\nIn April 2015 Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash at a court session about his extradition to the United States stated that at the Ukrainian presidential election he financially supported Poroshenko, and at the Kiev city mayor election – Vitaliy Klychko.\n\nOn 29 May 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko granted a Ukrainian citizenship to former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili almost 10 months after a Tbilisi city court approved the request of the General Prosecutor of Georgia's office and elected a pre-trial detention for Saakashvili in absentia as preventative measure. The reason for granting the citizenship was acknowledging that it \"poses a state interest of Ukraine\". In February 2015 the General Prosecutor of Georgia's office had appealed to the General Prosecutor of Ukraine office for extradition of Saakashvili. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia had also recalled the Ukraine Ambassador to Georgia, in relation to Saakashvili's appointment as a chairman of Consultative International Council of Reforms. Later during his visit to Georgia in 2017, President Poroshenko at his briefing in Tbilisi stated that Ukraine has never received any requests for extradition of Saakashvili, while Minister of Justice of Georgia Tea Tsulukiani countered it with the announcement that there were actually two official requests. The very next day after receiving citizenship on 30 May 2015 Saakashvili was appointment by the president as a head (governor) of the Odessa Regional State Administration (see Governor of Odessa Oblast).\n\nIn January 2018 journalists from Radio Free Europe reported that during Poroshenko's New Year's vacation starting 1 January 2018 on the Maldives there were 10 people who spent $500 000, rented separate islands and the most expensive hotel in the country. On 30 March 2018 Poroshenko submitted his income declaration. Poroshenko declared that he spent between 1.3 and 1.4 million UAH on this vacation – two times less than journalists had reported (some details about the president's vacation were classified).\n\n\n"}

Their early music features country imagery to the sound of acoustic string instruments such as banjo, guitar and mandolin.\n\nSpoon has performed with such artists as Annabelle Chvostek, Ember Swift, Kinnie Starr, Melissa Ferrick, The Be Good Tanyas, Bitch & Animal, Natalie Merchant and Earl Scruggs. They have performed at festivals including North Country Fair, South Country Fair, Under the Volcano Festival, and the Vancouver, Regina, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, Brandon Folk, Music & Art Festival and Winnipeg folk festivals.\n\nSpoon's breakthrough album, 2008's \"Superioryouareinferior\", was recorded in Calgary and introduced some electronic music elements into Spoon's style. \"Superioryouareinferior\" includes themes previously used by Spoon like Canadian history and culture such as the commentary on colonialism in their song \"Come On Forest Fire Burn The Disco Down\". \"Superioryouareinferior\" was a longlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize.\n\nWhile touring Europe Spoon met Alexandre Decoupigny in Berlin. Decoupigny and Spoon collaborated in the album \"Worauf Wartest Du?\" Decoupigny taught Spoon how to create music with a computer which inspired the musician to further experiment with electronic music. The experimentation with electronic music influenced their subsequent albums and culminated in \"I Can't Keep All Our Secrets\".\n\nThey have also published \"First Spring Grass Fire\", a book of short stories about growing up in Alberta. Arsenal Pulp Press released the book in the fall of 2012. The book was a nominee for the 2013 Lambda Literary Awards in the Transgender Fiction category, and Spoon was awarded an Honour of Distinction from the Dayne Ogilvie Prize for LGBT writers in 2014.\n\nSpoon has stated that \"First Spring Grass Fire\" was written to help them prepare for the production of a National Film Board of Canada documentary about their life and music, \"My Prairie Home\", directed by Chelsea McMullan. The film was released in the fall of 2013. \"My Prairie Home\", the album of music that Spoon composed for the film, was a longlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.\n\nIn 2012, Spoon and Ivan Coyote collaborated on \"Gender Failure\", a touring multimedia show in which both artists performed music and spoken word pieces about their failed attempts at fitting into the gender binary. A book based on the show was published by Arsenal Pulp in 2014.\n\nIn 2014, Spoon composed music for the feature film \"The Valley Below\".\n\nSpoon began the music label Coax Records \"out of a love for indie music and as an answer to under representation for many groups in the music industry.\" The album \"Armour\" was released on Coax in 2016.\n\n\n"}

Salaman\n\nRedcliffe Nathan Salaman (12 September 1874 – 12 June 1955) was a British botanist and potato breeder. His landmark work was the 1949 book on the \"History and Social influence of the Potato\", a book that established the history of nutrients as a new literary genre.\n\nSalaman was born in Kensington, London and was the ninth of fifteen children born to his parents Sarah Solomon and Myer Salaman who was a wealthy merchant who traded in ostrich feathers at the height of the plume trade.\n\nThe Salaman family are Ashkenazi Jews, who according to Salaman, migrated to Britain from either Holland or the Rhineland in the early 18th century.\n\nSalaman was educated at St Paul's School, London initially studying classics but due to the dull teaching methods he switched to studying science and later became head boy of the Science Side of the school. He obtained a scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1893 and graduated with a first class degree in Natural Sciences in 1896 having studied physiology, zoology and chemistry. He was tutored and advised by the physiologist W. H. Gaskell who later became a good friend of Salaman. He moved to the London Hospital in 1896 to study medicine and remained there until he qualified in 1900.\n\nIn 1903, Salaman was appointed Director of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital but in 1904 he developed tuberculosis and had to stop practising medicine and spend six months in a Swiss sanitorium. It took him over two years to fully recover from the illness, changing the course of his entire life. He purchased a house in Barley, Hertfordshire and because he could not return to practising medicine began experimenting in the emerging science of genetics under the guidance of his friend William Bateson. After several failed experiments with a range of animals, Salaman decided to experiment with potatoes after seeking advice from his gardener. Later in his career, commenting on his decision to study potatoes Salaman noted that he had \"embarked on an enterprise which, after forty years, leaves more questions unsolved than were thought at that time to exist. Whether it was mere luck, or whether the potato and I were destined for life partnership, I do not know, but from that moment my course was set, and I became ever more involved in problems associated directly or indirectly with a plant with which I had no particular affinity, gustatory or romantic\".\n\nWorking in his private garden, he initially set out to cross two potato varieties and establish which traits were dominant and recessive in a similar manner to Gregor Mendel's work on peas, but he soon broadened into other areas. In 1908, he decided to include wild potatoes in his experiments and requested that Kew Gardens provide him with \"Solanum maglia\". Kew's stocks had been incorrectly labelled however and Salaman was sent \"Solanum edinense\" instead. In 1909, Salaman grew 40 self-fertilised crosses of \"S. edinense\" and found that seven of them did not succumb to late blight (\"Phytophthora infestans\"). Convinced that resistance to late blight existed in wild species he began to study other species and found that \"Solanum demissum\" was also resistant to blight. Salaman started to cross \"S. demissum\" with domesticated varieties of potato in 1911 to produce high yielding lines that were also resistant to late blight. By 1914, he had successfully created hybrids and in 1926 he remarked that he had produced varieties with \"reasonably good economic characteristics which, no matter what their maturity, appeared to be immune to late blight. Salaman was the first to identify genetic resistance to late blight and \"S. demissum\" was still used as a source of resistance in the 1950s. In \"The Propitious Esculent\", John Reader called Salaman's discovery \"an important breakthrough, offering real promise ... that it was possible to breed blight-resistant potato varieties\". In 1987, it was thought that half of the potato varieties cultivated in Europe contained genes from \"S. demissum\".\n\nIn 1910, he published a paper the inheritance of colour in potato in the first issue of the \"Journal of Genetics\". Later papers in the \"Journal of Agricultural Science\" examined male sterility, methods for estimating yields and detecting viruses in seed potatoes and a study of how the size of seed tubers affected the yield and size of tubers of the crop. He wrote the book \"Potato Varieties\" in 1929.\n\nHis research on potatoes was disrupted by the outbreak of the First World War during which Salaman joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in Palestine. Afterwards he was appointed chairman of the potato synonym committee at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany where he was tasked with describing potato varieties and putting an end to the common practice of marketing old and unreliable varieties under new names. His work there culminated in the publication of \"Potato Varieties\" in 1926. The same year he persuaded the Ministry of Agriculture to establish the Potato Virus Research Institute in Cambridge of which he remained a director until 1939. Kenneth Manley Smith was an entomologist at the institute and became Salaman's assistant in 1930. Smith and Bawden went on to become renowned plant virologists. In conjunction with Paul A. Murphy of Dublin a large stock of virus-free potatoes was built up and multiplied in greenhouses, a practice which continued after his death and was adopted in other countries. His research on viruses lead to him being elected to the Royal Society in 1935.\n\nSalaman supervised the PhD thesis of Jack Hawkes, who went on to become an authority in the taxonomy of wild potato species and identified sources of resistance to potato cyst nematodes.\n\nSalaman authored \"The History and Social Influence of the Potato\" first published in 1949, reprinted in 1970 and revised under the guidance of Jack Hawkes in 1987. A review of the first edition in the \"British Journal of Sociology\" noted that it was an \"unusual and vastly interesting book which took nine years to write, and a life-time to prepare\" combining genetics, history and archaeology. The book covers every aspect of the history of the potato with a particular focus on Ireland about which he wrote \"in no other country can [potato's] influence on the domestic and economic life of the people be studied to greater advantage\".\n\nThe historian Eric Hobsbawm referred to the work as \"that magnificent monument of scholarship and humanity\". A 1999 paper in \"Potato Research\" noted that because of Salaman's \"unprecedented\" book, we \"know more about the impact of the diffusion of potato on the welfare of people, particularly the poor, than about such consequences following the introduction of any other major food plant.\"\n\nSalaman combined active Zionism with research into the genetics and social history of the potato, which led him to an interest in eugenics and racial explanations for Arab \"failure\". In 1919, he was uncomfortably conscious that clearing Palestine of Arabs would be \"simply ridiculous and comparable to Cromwell's effort in Ireland\", and the chief moral he drew from the Holocaust was the peril of attributing misfortune to racial characteristics rather than political oppression. \n\nOn 23 October 1901, first to Hebrew scholar Nina Ruth Davis, whom he had met four months earlier at the New West End Synagogue. They were engaged ten days after meeting. After living in Berlin for several months, while Redcliffe completed advanced training in pathology, they returned to London, where he assumed the directorship of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital. They had six children including a cancer researcher, a doctor, the engineer Raphael Salaman, the artist Ruth Collet and the singer Esther Salaman. They settled in the country, in the village of Barley in Hertfordshire where they lived with their six children (one of whom died in childhood). Nina Salaman continued to pursue her interest in medieval Hebrew poetry. Despite Barley's distance from London, she maintained a kosher home and Sabbath observance. For the festivals, the family traveled to London, where they stayed with one of Redcliffe's siblings and worshipped at the New West End Synagogue. She took personal responsibility for the Hebrew education of her children until they left for boarding school.\n\nSalaman's paternal granddaughter is Chair of Jewish Voice for Labour Jenny Manson.\n\nIn 1925, Salaman's first wife Nina died. In 1926, he met and married Gertrude Lowy who survived him.\n\n\n\n"}

In his youth, he was a gentleman's tailor in Smederevska Palanka. He never married, which was unusual for small town business owners of the time in Serbia. For a time, he shared a house with a certain other confirmed bachelor, originally from Negotin, one Borisav Petrović, and they had a joint entreprise for constructing adobe houses. During this time Karađorđe Petrović spent several months in Glavaš's house, either as an apprentice or as a hajduk in hiding during wintertime.\n\nLater, Glavaš was the co-leader, with and , of a hajduk company based in Austrian-held Syrmia, which frequently crossed the Ottoman border, and attacked Ottoman forces and caravans in the Sanjak of Smederevo in the 1790s (including Koča's frontier rebellion).\n\nIn 1804, at the eve of the First Serbian Uprising, Glavaš, Karađorđe and several other leaders gathered at Orašac to organize the revolt (see Serbian Revolution). Glava[ was suggested as leader. He refused the offer, opting for Karađorđe instead. In December 1806, commanders Vujica, Mladen Milovanović and Glavaš commanded an army of 18,000 soldiers to defend the Serbs at the Battle of Deligrad. The fight ended in Serbian victory, with Ibrahim Bushati, pasha of Shkodër, signing a 6-week truce. He led a company of around 3,000 men which liberated Prokuplje and Kuršumlija. His company guarded the Morava Valley and fought the Ottomans in the mountains of Niš and Novi Pazar for two months before being captured. He was killed by the Ottomans on 15 February 1815, after the demise of Hadži-Prodan's Uprising. His severed head was on display at the Kalemegdan along with other Serbian leaders.\n\nIn his home town, there is a street and an elementary school named after him.

He formerly competed in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, winning the Daytona 500 in 1994 and 1995. He is the son of late NASCAR driver Coo Coo Marlin. He is married to Paula and has a daughter, Sutherlin, and a son, Steadman, a former Nationwide Series driver.\n\nMarlin attended Spring Hill High School, where he played high school basketball and football, earning the captain status his senior year while he played quarterback and linebacker. He began his collection of civil war artifacts shortly after high school. In 1976, he made his NASCAR debut at Nashville Speedway, filling in for his injured father in the No. 14 H.B. Cunningham Chevrolet. He started 30th and finished 29th after suffering oil pump failure early in the race. He made two more starts in 1978, finishing ninth at World 600 and twenty-fifth at Nashville for Cunningham. He ran Nashville again in 1979, finishing seventeenth. In 1980, he posted two top-tens, eighth in the Daytona 500 for Cunningham, and seventh at Nashville for D.K. Ulrich. From 1980 to 1982, Marlin was a three-time track champion at the historic Nashville Speedway USA.\n\nIn 1983, Marlin was hired by Roger Hamby to drive his No. 17 Hesco Exhaust-sponsored Chevrolet. He posted a tenth-place finish at Dover International Speedway and finished 19th in the standings, clinching the Rookie of the Year award. Despite finishing 15th in the 1984 Daytona 500 for Hamby, Marlin spent most of the season running for Sadler Brothers Racing, posting two top-ten finishes. He also competed in one race for Jimmy Means and Dick Bahre respectively. Marlin only made eight starts in 1985, seven of them coming for Sadler, his best finish being 12th at Talladega Superspeedway. He ended his season at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the Miller High Life 500, driving the Helen Rae Special. He finished 29th, after suffering flywheel failure.\n\nMarlin moved over to the No. 1 Bull's Eye Barbecue Sauce-sponsored car owned by Hoss Ellington in 1986. His best finish that season came at the Firecracker 400, where he finished second. Marlin received a full-time ride in 1987, when he was hired by Billy Hagan to drive the No. 44 Piedmont Airlines-sponsored Oldsmobile. He had four top-fives and finished 11th in points. The following season, he had seven finishes of eighth or better in the first ten races and finished tenth in the standings. In 1989, the team received sponsorship from Sunoco and switched to the number 94. He tied a career-best 13 top-ten finishes but dropped to 12th in the final standings. He left the team at the end of the 1990 season. During the 1990 season, he won his first career Busch Series race at Charlotte, driving the No. 48 Diamond Ridge-sponsored Chevrolet owned by Fred Turner.\n\nMarlin signed to drive the No. 22 Maxwell House-sponsored Ford Thunderbird for Junior Johnson in 1991. He had a second-place finish at Daytona to start the season and won two poles at Talladega Superspeedway and the Firecracker 400, finishing seventh in the standings. The next season, he won an additional five poles and had six top-five finishes. Despite his career-high pole total, Marlin departed to drive the No. 8 Raybestos-sponsored Ford for Stavola Brothers Racing. He had just one top-five finish and fell to fourteenth in the standings.\n\nMarlin's first career win came in his 279th career start at the 1994 Daytona 500 driving for Morgan-McClure Motorsports in the No. 4 Kodak-sponsored Chevrolet. He went on to win the 500 again in the following year, becoming only one of three drivers to win consecutive Daytona 500s. The other two men that have accomplished that feat were Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough. He also became the only driver to have his first two career wins at the Daytona 500. Marlin won 2 more times during the 1995 season and finished a career high third in the point standings, during a four-year run with Morgan-McClure Motorsports. In 1997, he did not return to victory lane and dropped to 25th in the final standings. He left the No. 4 team at year's end.\n\nIn 1998, he joined SABCO Racing to drive the No. 40 Coors Light-sponsored Chevrolet. He opened the season by winning the Gatorade 125, a qualifying race for the Daytona 500 but three weeks later, he failed to qualify for the Primestar 500, the first race he had missed since 1986. He finished in the Top 10 six times and had a 13th-place points finish. In 1999, he won his first pole since 1995 at Pocono Raceway, but dropped down to sixteenth in the standings. In 2000, he won his second career Busch Series race, driving SABCO's No. 82 entry at Bristol Motor Speedway. During the season, he lost teammate Kenny Irwin, Jr. in a practice crash at New Hampshire International Speedway. After finishing in the Top 10 seven times, he fell back to 19th in the overall standings.\n\nIn 2001, SABCO's majority ownership stake was purchased by CART & IndyCar championship owner Chip Ganassi and the team switched to Dodge Intrepids. In his first race with the new team, Marlin won the Gatorade 125 qualifying race at Daytona. Three days later at the Daytona 500, Marlin appeared to make contact with Dale Earnhardt, causing Earnhardt to crash into the turn 4 wall, an impact that would kill him. In the following days, Marlin and his family received hate mail and death threats from angry fans who felt that Marlin was responsible for Earnhardt's death. He was eventually publicly defended by two of Earnhardt's drivers, his son and race winner Michael Waltrip, and was also cleared of any wrongdoing by NASCAR's investigation into the accident. He won Dodge's first race in its return to NASCAR at Michigan International Speedway, as well as winning the UAW-GM Quality 500 at Charlotte. He tied his career best points finish of third that season. Had the current Chase points system been in place in 2001, Marlin would have been the 2001 champion.\nIn 2002, Marlin had a strong car at the Daytona 500, and towards the end was battling Jeff Gordon for the lead when they made contact, sending Gordon spinning, and triggering a crash. NASCAR red-flagged the race so it would not finish under caution, and stopped the field momentarily on the backstretch. Concerned about a damaged right front fender, Marlin jumped out of his car and started pulling the fender away from the tire. As working on the car is prohibited during red flag conditions, Marlin was sent to the tail end of the field for the restart.\n\nThe following week, Marlin finished second in Rockingham to Matt Kenseth. Marlin took the points lead and did not let it go for the following 24 weeks. For most of that time he held a comfortable lead, which reached triple digits several times. Marlin followed this 2nd-place finish with a win at the UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, but not without controversy: During the race, Marlin spun while making late race pit stop, causing him to break the pit road speed limit. NASCAR's penalty for being too fast entering pit road was to hold the car in its pit stall for an additional 15 seconds, but the official at Marlin's pit stall was not informed of the penalty until \"after\" the crew had released the car. NASCAR determined that they had no precedent for forcing Marlin to return to the pits as his early release was their mistake (and they could not order him to return for a stop and go penalty). Following the incident, NASCAR changed the rule so that all speeding violations are enforced with a drive through penalty (forcing the driver to travel the length of pit road at the speed limit).\n\nAfter this win, Marlin finished 9th the following week at Atlanta. The week after that, he won the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington Raceway, which would be the final win of his Cup career.\n\nWith a series of strong finishes (7th at Texas, 5th at Talladega, 7th at California, 4th in June at Pocono, 3rd at Daytona, 3rd at the second Pocono race, 6th at Michigan in August, 7th at Bristol, and 4th at Darlington in the fall), Marlin was still 91 points ahead of second place entering the Chevy Monte Carlo 400 in September. However, Marlin finished that race in last place after an early accident and saw his points lead all but evaporate as Mark Martin, who had entered the race 125 points behind Marlin, gained 116 points and moved into second place in the points as Marlin's lead shrunk to nine points (Jeff Gordon, who had leapfrogged Martin for second place in the standings with a win the week before, also gained on Marlin but dropped to fourth due to the strong finishes from both Martin and Jimmie Johnson, who gained 95 points on Marlin to move into third). At the New Hampshire 300 the next week Marlin lost the points lead as Martin finished four places ahead of him, gaining 15 points. The next week, Marlin dropped to 4th in the standings after a 21st-place finish at Dover.\n\nOne week later, at the Protection One 400 at Kansas, Marlin had a hard crash after 147 laps and finished 33rd. He was diagnosed with a cracked vertebra in his neck and would be forced to miss the remaining seven races. Marlin was replaced by Busch Series driver Jamie McMurray, who had recently been signed by Chip Ganassi Racing to drive for the team in the 2003 season. McMurray won the UAW-GM Quality 500 in his second start with Marlin's car, and Marlin telephoned McMurray during the post-race festivities to congratulate him. Marlin ultimately finished 18th in the final season points with eight Top 5s and ten Top 10s. It has been rumored that the broken neck signified the beginning of the struggles for Chip Ganassi Racing and the beginning of the dissolving of Sterling Marlin's career in motorsports.\n\nMarlin did not finish in the Top 5 in 2003, but had 11 Top 10 and matched his previous year's finish of 18th in points. He did however come close to a win at the 2003 Sharpie 500 at his hometown in Bristol Tennessee. Marlin controlled the race early and mid-way and appeared to have victory in his hands until he was wrecked by Kurt Busch with less than 150 laps to go. Kurt Busch went on to win the race but apologized in victory lane. Sterling Marlin however was not pleased with Busch in post-race ceremonies, stating \"What a bone-headed move. I guess Spencer didn't punch him hard enough.\", as a reference to Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer's altercation the previous week.\nDespite three Top 5s in 2004, he fell to 21st in points. During the 2005 season, Ganassi announced Marlin would be replaced by David Stremme for the 2006 season in order to attract the younger male demographic. It was also said that Richard Childress Racing had offered Marlin a deal to drive the No. 07 Jack Daniels-sponsored Chevrolet, However, Marlin honored his contract with Ganassi and finished out the 2005 season. He did however miss one race-the 2005 Sirius at the Glen to attend the funeral of his father Coo Coo Marlin who died of lung cancer one day before the race. Road ringer Scott Pruett replaced Sterling in the 40 and finished 4th in the race.\n\nHe reached as high as 6th in the points standings, but would later fall to 30th in the final standings.\n\nMarlin joined MB2 Motorsports for 2006 to drive the Waste Management Chevy, running with the No. 14 in tribute to his father, Coo Coo Marlin, who died during the 2005 season. Marlin's only Top 10 finish in 2006 was 9th place at Richmond. His 2006 season was shadowed by bad luck and No. 14 finished 36th in owner points.\n\nMarlin was able to qualify via speed for each of the first five races of the 2007 season, his Pep Boys No. 14 team was the only team out of the top 35 from 2006 to do this. Marlin's run in the No. 14 ended on July 17, 2007, when Ginn Racing announced Regan Smith, who had been splitting time with Mark Martin in Ginn's U.S. Army-sponsored No. 01 car, would replace him beginning at the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard at Indianapolis. He attempted to qualify for two races in 2007, but he failed to qualify for either. He tried to make the Sharpie 500 at Bristol in the No. 78 car as a replacement for Kenny Wallace, and the UAW-Ford 500 at Talladega, replacing Mike Wallace in the No. 09 car. However, in November he managed to qualify the No. 09 and drove at Phoenix for a 25th-place finish, and a week later at Homestead finishing 33rd.\n\nMarlin failed to qualify for the 2008 Daytona 500 in the No. 09 car, but qualified at Talladega and the following week at Richmond as well. For Darlington, Marlin raced in his old No. 40 car and qualified 14th, and also at the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in the No. 40, still in for the injured Dario Franchitti. He finished out the rest of the season driving for Phoenix Racing. In March 2009, Marlin participated in and won the Saturday Night Special, a charity event at Bristol Motor Speedway which included NASCAR Legends. He led the entire event in a car painted similar to the one he drove with Morgan McClure Motorsports, and wearing an older-style Coors Light uniform from his days while driving for Chip Ganassi.\nFor the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Marlin continued to run a limited schedule in the No. 09 Phoenix Racing Miccosukee Resort & Gaming Chevrolet. His best finish for the 2009 season was 35th at Martinsville, which also proved the last of his 748 career starts.\n\nAn announcement was made preceding the Cup Series finale weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway that Marlin would attempt the race in the No. 70 Chevrolet for TRG Motorsports, though Marlin later denied it.\n\nMarlin announced his retirement from racing on March 18, 2010, and formerly owned a Chevrolet dealership in Ashland City, Tennessee and a Dodge dealership in Dickson, Tennessee. In 2012, Marlin publicly revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinsonism.\n\nIn late 2011, Marlin helped form Tennessee Racing Association, LLC, along with several other drivers (including Chad Chaffin and Mike Alexander) and businessmen, in an effort to preserve Fairgrounds Speedway and allow the track to remain active in the racing community.\n\nAlthough he is retired from NASCAR competition, Marlin still remains an active driver in the Pro Late Model Division at Fairgrounds Speedway. He currently leads the point standings in that division to go along with his two victories in 2013, driving the No. 40 car.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "6299726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6299726", "title": "Utnapishtim", "text": "Utnapishtim\n\nUtnapishtim or Utanapishtim () is a character in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" who is tasked by Enki (Ea) to abandon his worldly possessions and create a giant ship to be called \"Preserver of Life\". He was also tasked with bringing his wife, family, and relatives along with the craftsmen of his village, baby animals, and grains. The oncoming flood would wipe out all animals and people not on the ship, a concept similar to the biblical story of Noah's Ark. After twelve days on the water, Utnapishtim opened the hatch of his ship to look around and saw the slopes of Mount Nisir, where he rested his ship for seven days. On the seventh day, he sent a dove out to see if the water had receded, and the dove could find nothing but water, so it returned. Then he sent out a swallow, and just as before, it returned, having found nothing. Finally, Utnapishtim sent out a raven, and the raven saw that the waters had receded, so it circled around, but did not return. Utnapishtim then set all the animals free, and made a sacrifice to the gods. The gods came, and because he had preserved the seed of man while remaining loyal and trusting of his gods, Utnapishtim and his wife were given immortality, as well as a place among the heavenly gods. Enki (Ea) also claims that he did not tell \"Atrahasis\" (apparently referring to Utnapishtim) about the flood, but rather that he only made a dream appear to him, a claim which contradicts the earlier narrative of the poem and reveals an alternative telling.\n\nIn the epic, overcome with the death of his friend Enkidu, the hero Gilgamesh sets out on a series of journeys to search for his ancestor Utnapishtim (Xisouthros) who lives at the mouth of the rivers and has been given eternal life. Utnapishtim counsels Gilgamesh to abandon his search for immortality, but gives him a trial to defy sleep if he wishes to obtain immortality. Failing at his trial to defy sleep, Utnapishtim next tells Gilgamesh about a plant that can make him young again. Gilgamesh obtains the plant from the bottom of the sea in Dilmun (often considered to be current-day Bahrain) but a serpent steals it, and Gilgamesh returns home to the city of Uruk, having abandoned hope of either immortality or renewed youth.\n\nThe \"Preserver of Life\" was made of solid timber, so that the rays of Shamash (the sun) would not shine in, and of equal dimensions in length and width. The design of the ship was supposedly drawn on the ground by Enki, and the frame of the ark, which was made in five days, was 200 feet in length, width and height, with a floor-space of one acre. The ark interior had seven floors, each floor divided into 9 sections, finishing the ark fully on the seventh day. The entrance to the ship was sealed once everyone had boarded the ship.\n\n"}
