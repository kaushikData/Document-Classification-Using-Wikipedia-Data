He studied theology at Exeter College, Oxford, receiving a first-class degree in 1948, and completed his graduate studies in the early Church in 1956 under the patristics scholar Frank Leslie Cross.\n\nHe taught at Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone (1957–62) and the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (1962–65). He was later appointed to a post in ecclesiastical history in the University of Aberdeen in 1966, before being the first head of the Department of Religious studies in the University of Aberdeen (1970). He would subsequently move to the University of Edinburgh in 1986. He is currently Professor of the History of Mission at Liverpool Hope University, Honorary Professor at the University of Edinburgh, Research Professor at Africa International University's Center for World Christianity, and Professor Emeritus at the Akrofi-Christaller Institute of Theology, Mission and Culture.\n\nWalls established the \"Journal of Religion in Africa\" in 1967 and \"Studies in World Christianity\" in 1995. He also founded the Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World (now known as the Centre for the Study of World Christianity), first at the University of Aberdeen in 1982, before moving it to the University of Edinburgh in 1987, a year after he moved to Edinburgh.\n\nWith his late wife Doreen Harden, whom he married in 1953, they have two children, Christine and Andrew. After Doreen's death, he married Ingrid Reneau in 2012, a Research Fellow with the Presbyterian Mission Agency.\n\nOn 26 November 2018, Walls received an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Edinburgh in recognition of his scholarly contributions to the study of Christianity in Africa and the non-Western world.\n\nWalls' most significant observations have concerned the geographical trends in Christianity in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in terms of expansion in Africa, in what is generally termed World Christianity. Historian Lamin Sanneh commented that he was 'one of the few scholars who saw that African Christianity was not just an exotic, curious phenomenon in an obscure part of the world, but that African Christianity might be the shape of things to come'. His pioneering research led the magazine \"Christianity Today\" to describe him in 2007 as 'a historian ahead of his time' and 'the most important person you don't know'.\n\nLiverpool Hope University has a research centre named in honour of him, which encourages and supports research in the field of African and Asian Christianity.\n\nAlthough he is more well known for his work in Christianity, Walls has also been a significant pioneer in shaping the field of religious studies as it is taught in universities of Scotland. When he first returned to Scotland, Walls taught Ecclesiastical History in the University of Aberdeen in 1966. However, he recognised that the Faculty of Divinity in Aberdeen did not allow for a sufficient global perspective of religion, and founded the Department of Religious studies outside the Faculty of Divinity in 1970.\n\nSignificantly, Walls' work in Aberdeen would establish the first department of Religious Studies in Scotland. In the mid-1970s, the department would be known for emphasising work in the study of what was then called 'primal religions'. Moreover, his vision for a global perspective of religion allowed for Walls to attract a number of significant members of staff and students who were interested in religions of the non-Western world. It would also be in this new department that the original Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World was established, before eventually being relocated to the University of Edinburgh in 1987. It has been known as the Centre for the Study of World Christianity since 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull bibliography of works through 2011 can be found in William Burrows, Mark Gornik and Janice McLean (eds) \"Understanding World Christianity: The Vision and Work of Andrew F.

It was published on 10 December 2008, the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopting name and style from the anti-Soviet Charter 77 issued by dissidents in Czechoslovakia. Since its release, more than 10,000 people inside and outside China have signed the charter.\n\nIn 2009, one of the authors of Charter '08, Liu Xiaobo, was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment for \"inciting subversion of state power\" because of his involvement. A year later, Liu was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize by Norway Nobel Committee. Seven years later in July 2017, he died of terminal liver cancer in the prison after having been granted medical parole.\n\nMany of the original signatories were prominent Chinese citizens inside and outside the government, including lawyers; a Tibetan poet and essayist, Woeser; and Bao Tong, a former senior Communist Party official, who all faced a risk of arrest and jail. The Charter calls for 19 changes including an independent legal system, freedom of association and the elimination of one-party rule. \"All kinds of social conflicts have constantly accumulated and feelings of discontent have risen consistently,\" it reads. \"The current system has become backward to the point that change cannot be avoided.\" China remains the only large world power to still retain an authoritarian system that so infringes on human rights, it states. \"This situation must change! Political democratic reforms cannot be delayed any longer!\"\n\nSpecific demands are:\n\nThe opening paragraph of the charter states:\n\nThe Chinese government has said little publicly about the Charter. On 8 December 2008, two days before the 60th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Liu Xiaobo was detained by police, hours before the online release of the Charter. He was detained and later arrested on 23 June 2009, on charges of \"suspicion of inciting the subversion of state power.\" Several Nobel Laureates have written a letter to President Hu Jintao asking for his release; in response, the Chinese government has suppressed them: at least 70 of its 303 original signatories have been summoned or interrogated by police while domestic media have been forbidden to interview anyone who has signed the document. Police have also searched for or questioned a journalist, Li Datong, and two lawyers, though none have been arrested. State media has been banned from reporting on the manifesto. A blogging website popular with activists, bullog.cn, which may have had ties to the Charter, has been shut down.\nOn 25 December 2009 Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power\" activities by the court. On 8 October 2010 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China\".\n\nA number of governments, including those of the United States and Germany, as well as the opposition in Taiwan, have condemned the harassment of supporters of Charter 08 as well as hailing the Charter. Western press has generally covered the Charter positively, and international NGOs have supported its message. Other international figures, including the Dalai Lama, have also voiced their support and admiration of the Charter. There were also protests in Hong Kong demanding the release of Liu Xiaobo and other signatories.\n\n\n"}

Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.\n\nThe two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's \"central core\") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).\n\nThe 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as \"of the Princes\".\n\nUnder the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.\n\nThe Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by Władisław Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Michał Giedroyć vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus \"as used by his illustrious grandfather\" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania).\n\nBut the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyć armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4.\n\nThrough the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Mikołaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Mikołaj.\n\nAt the English College of Arms, the arms of Michal Giedroyc (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.\n\nEarly bearers of the Giedroyć name included:\n\n\nOther distinguished members of the two main lines of the family included:\n\n\nCurrent members of the family include:\n\n\nBearers of the name Guedroitz (the French version of the Russian version of Giedroyć) include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "165684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165684", "title": "Hannibal Lecter", "text": "Hannibal Lecter\n\nDr. Hannibal Lecter is a character in a series of suspense novels by Thomas Harris.\n\nLecter was introduced in the 1981 thriller novel \"Red Dragon\" as a forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. The novel and its sequel, \"The Silence of the Lambs\", feature Lecter as one of the primary antagonists after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, \"Hannibal\", Lecter becomes a protagonist. His role as the antihero occurs in the fourth novel, \"Hannibal Rising\", which explores his childhood and development into a serial killer.\n\nThe first film adapted from the Harris novels was \"Manhunter\" (based on \"Red Dragon\") which features Brian Cox as Lecter, spelled \"Lecktor\". In 1991, Anthony Hopkins won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the character in \"The Silence of the Lambs\". He would reprise the role in \"Hannibal\" in 2001 and in a second adaptation of \"Red Dragon\" made in 2002 under the original title.\n\nThe NBC television series \"Hannibal\" debuted in 2013, and focuses on the development of the relationship between Lecter and Will Graham, an FBI profiler. In the series, Lecter is portrayed by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, who won a Saturn Award for his performance.\n\nIn 2003, Hannibal Lecter (as portrayed by Hopkins) was chosen by the American Film Institute as the greatest villain in American cinema. In June 2010, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named him one of the \"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\".\n\n\"Red Dragon\" firmly states that Lecter does not fit any known psychological profile. In \"The Silence of the Lambs\", Lecter's keeper, Dr. Frederick Chilton, claims that Lecter is a \"pure sociopath\" (\"pure psychopath\" in the film adaptation). In the novel \"Red Dragon\", protagonist Will Graham says that Lecter has no conscience and tortured animals as a child, but does not exhibit any other of the criteria traditionally associated with sociopathy; Graham explains that psychiatrists refer to Lecter as a sociopath because \"they don't know what else to call him\". In the film adaptation of \"The Silence of the Lambs\", protagonist Clarice Starling says of Lecter, \"They don't have a name for what he is.\" \n\nLecter's pathology is explored in greater detail in \"Hannibal\" and \"Hannibal Rising\", which explains that he was traumatized as a child in Lithuania in 1944 when he witnessed the murder and cannibalism of his beloved sister, Mischa, by a group of deserting Lithuanian Hilfswillige, one of whom claimed that Lecter unwittingly ate his sister as well.\n\nAll media in which Lecter appears portray him as intellectually brilliant, cultured and sophisticated, with refined tastes in art, music and cuisine. He is frequently depicted preparing gourmet meals from his victims' flesh, the most famous example being his admission that he once ate a census taker's liver \"with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\" (a \"big Amarone\" in the novel). He is deeply offended by rudeness, and frequently kills people who have bad manners. Prior to his capture and imprisonment, he was a member of Baltimore, Maryland's social elite, and a sitting member of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra's board of directors.\n\nIn \"The Silence of the Lambs\", Lecter is described through Starling's eyes: \"small, sleek, and in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own\". The novel also reveals that Lecter's left hand has a condition called mid ray duplication polydactyly, i.e. a duplicated middle finger. In \"Hannibal\", he performs plastic surgery on his own face on several occasions, and removes his extra digit. Lecter's eyes are a shade of maroon, and reflect the light in \"pinpoints of red\". He has small white teeth and dark, slicked-back hair with a widow's peak. He also has a keen sense of smell; in \"The Silence of the Lambs\", he is able to identify through a plexiglass window with small holes the brand of perfume that Starling wore the day \"before\". He has an eidetic memory with which he has constructed in his mind an elaborate \"memory palace\" with which he relives memories and sensations in rich detail.\n\nIn the backstory of 1986 \"Red Dragon\", FBI profiler Will Graham interviews Lecter about one of his patients who was murdered by a serial killer, before intuiting that Lecter is the culprit. Realizing that Graham is on to him, Lecter creeps up behind Will and stabs him with a linoleum knife, nearly disemboweling him. Graham survives, but is so traumatized by the incident that he takes early retirement from the FBI. Lecter is charged with a series of nine murders, but is found not guilty by reason of insanity. He is institutionalized in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the care of Dr. Frederick Chilton, a pompous, incompetent psychologist whom he despises. Some years later, Graham comes out of retirement and consults Lecter in order to catch another serial killer, Francis Dolarhyde, known by the nickname \"The Tooth Fairy\". Through the classifieds of a tabloid called \"The National Tattler\", Lecter provides Dolarhyde with Graham's home address, enabling Dolarhyde to disfigure Graham and attempt to kill his family. At the end of the novel, Lecter sends Graham a taunting note saying that he hopes Graham isn't \"too ugly\".\n\nIn the 1988 sequel \"The Silence of the Lambs\", Lecter assists FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling in catching a serial killer known as \"Buffalo Bill\". Lecter is fascinated by Starling, and they form an unusual relationship in which he provides her with a profile of the killer and his modus operandi in exchange for details about her unhappy childhood. Lecter had previously met Buffalo Bill, the former lover of his patient (and eventual victim) Benjamin Raspail. He does not reveal this information directly, instead giving Starling vague clues to help her figure it out for herself. In return for Lecter's assistance, the FBI and Chilton arrange for him to be transferred to a lower security facility. He escapes while in transit, however, killing and mutilating his guards and using one of their faces as a mask to fool paramedics. While in hiding, he writes a letter to Starling wishing her well, and another to Chilton swearing gruesome revenge; Chilton disappears soon afterward.\n\nIn the third novel, 1999's \"Hannibal\", Lecter lives in a palazzo in Florence, Italy, and works as a museum curator under the alias \"Dr. Fell\". The novel reveals that one of Lecter's victims survived: Mason Verger, a wealthy, sadistic pedophile whom Lecter had brutalized during a therapy session, leaving him a horrifically disfigured quadriplegic. Verger offers a huge reward for anyone who apprehends Lecter, whom he intends to feed to wild boars specially bred for the purpose. Verger enlists the help of Rinaldo Pazzi, a disgraced Italian police inspector, and Paul Krendler, a corrupt Justice Department official and Starling's boss. Lecter kills Pazzi and returns to the United States to escape Verger's Sardinian henchmen, only to be captured. Starling follows them, intent on apprehending Lecter personally, and is injured in a gunfight with Verger's henchmen. Lecter escapes, and persuades Verger's sister Margot - his former patient, whom Verger had molested and raped years earlier - to kill her brother, promising to take the blame. He rescues the wounded Starling and takes her to Krendler's rented lake house to treat her, subjecting her to a regimen of mind-altering drugs and classical conditioning in order to make her believe she is his long-dead sister Mischa. One day, he invites her to a formal dinner where the guest and first course is Paul Krendler, whose brain they consume together. On this night, Starling tells Lecter that Mischa's memory can live within him instead of taking her place. She then offers him her breast, and they become lovers. Three years later, former orderly Barney Matthews, who had befriended and respected Lecter while he was incarcerated in Baltimore, sees Lecter and Starling entering the Teatro Colón opera house in Buenos Aires. Fearing for his life, Barney leaves Buenos Aires immediately, never to return.\n\nHarris wrote a 2006 prequel, \"Hannibal Rising\", after film producer Dino De Laurentiis (who owned the cinematic rights to the Lecter character) announced that he was going to make a film depicting Lecter's childhood and development into a serial killer with or without Harris' help. Harris would also write the film's screenplay. The novel chronicles Lecter's early life, from his birth into an aristocratic family in Lithuania in 1933, to being orphaned, along with his beloved sister Mischa, in 1944 when a German Stuka bomber attacks a Soviet tank in front of their forest hideaway. Shortly thereafter, he and Mischa are captured by a band of German collaborators, who murder and cannibalize Mischa before her brother's eyes; Lecter later learns that the collaborators also fed him Mischa's remains. Irreparably traumatized, Lecter escapes from the deserters and wanders through the forest, dazed and unable to speak. He is found and taken in by an orphanage, where he is bullied by the other children and abused by the dean. He is adopted by his uncle Robert and his Japanese wife, Lady Murasaki, who nurses him back to health and teaches him to speak again. After his uncle's death, Lecter forms a close, pseudo-romantic relationship with his step-aunt. During this time he also shows great intellectual aptitude, entering medical school at a young age and distinguishing himself. Despite his seemingly comfortable life, Lecter is consumed by a savage obsession with avenging Mischa's death. He kills for the first time as a teenager, beheading a racist fishmonger who insulted Murasaki. He then methodically tracks down, tortures, and murders each of the men who had killed his sister. In the process of taking his revenge, he forsakes his relationship with Murasaki and seemingly loses all traces of his humanity. The novel ends with Lecter being accepted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\n\"Red Dragon\" was first adapted to film in 1986 as the Michael Mann film \"Manhunter\", although the spelling of Lecter's name was changed to \"Lecktor\". He was played by actor Brian Cox. Cox based his performance on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel.\n\nIn 1991, Orion Pictures produced a Jonathan Demme-directed adaptation of \"The Silence of the Lambs\", in which Lecter was played by actor Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins' Academy Award–winning performance made Lecter into a cultural icon. In 2001, \"Hannibal\" was adapted to film, with Hopkins reprising his role. In the film adaptation, the ending is revised: Starling attempts to apprehend Lecter, who escapes after cutting off his own hand to free himself from her handcuffs. In 2002, \"Red Dragon\" was adapted again, this time under its original title, with Hopkins again as Lecter and Edward Norton as Will Graham. Hopkins wrote a screenplay for a \"Hannibal\" sequel, ending with Starling killing Lecter, but it was never produced.\n\nIn late 2006, the novel \"Hannibal Rising\" was adapted into the film of the same name, which portrayed Lecter's development into a serial killer. In the film, which was finished by 2007, eight-year-old Lecter is portrayed by Aaran Thomas, while Gaspard Ulliel portrays him as a young man. Both the novel and film received generally negative critical reviews.\n\nIn February 2012, NBC gave a series order to \"Hannibal\", a television adaptation of \"Red Dragon\" to be written and executive-produced by Bryan Fuller. Mads Mikkelsen plays Lecter, opposite Hugh Dancy as Will Graham.\n\nFuller commented on Mikkelsen's version of Lecter: \"What I love about Mads' approach to the character is that, in our first meeting, he was adamant that he didn't want to do Hopkins or Cox. He talked about the character not so much as 'Hannibal Lecter the cannibal psychiatrist', but as Satan – this fallen angel who's enamoured with mankind and had an affinity for who we are as people, but was definitely not among us – he was other. I thought that was a really cool, interesting approach, because I love science fiction and horror and – not that we'd ever do anything deliberately to suggest this – but having it subtextually play as him being Lucifer felt like a really interesting kink to the series. It was slightly different than anything that's been done before and it also gives it a slightly more epic quality if you watch the show through the prism of, 'This is Satan at work, tempting someone with the apple of their psyche'. It appealed to all of those genre things that get me excited about any sort of entertainment.\"\n\nThe first season amends the series' continuity so that Graham and Lecter first work together during the hunt for Garrett Jacob Hobbs (Vladimir Jon Cubrt), the \"Minnesota Shrike\", a serial killer who preys on college girls. During the investigation, Lecter secretly calls Hobbs to tip him off that Graham is on to him. As a result, Hobbs turns on his own family, killing his wife and trying to kill his daughter Abigail (Kacey Rohl) as Graham charges in and shoots him dead. Killing Hobbs weighs on Graham's conscience and gives him nightmares, so his boss Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) sends him to Lecter for counseling. Throughout the first season, Lecter acts as Graham's unofficial psychiatrist, and they form a tenuous friendship. Lecter and Graham also become father figures to Abigail, and cover for her when they discover that she was her father's accomplice. Lecter is fascinated by Graham's ability to empathize with psychopaths, and he spends much of the series trying to undermine Graham's fragile sanity and push him into becoming a killer. To this end, Lecter prevents Graham from learning that he has advanced encephalitis, just to see how Graham would function under the circumstances. In the first-season finale, Lecter reluctantly frames Graham for a series of murders that he himself committed throughout the season – including, apparently, Abigail's – but not before Graham realizes that Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper, the very serial killer he has been trying to catch.\n\nThroughout the beginning of the second season, Graham, who is now institutionalized, attempts to convince his skeptical former colleagues that Lecter is the real killer and begins pulling strings from within his cell in order to expose him. Meanwhile, Lecter begins to manipulate evidence from the outside, exonerating himself after the FBI's initial investigations into Graham's claims. Eventually, Graham persuades his friend and colleague Beverly Katz (Hetienne Park), a forensic scientist, to investigate Lecter in exchange for help on a case. She breaks into Lecter's house, where she find evidence of his guilt. Lecter catches her, however, and kills her; he then sections her body vertically and displays it in tableau. Angry and vengeful, Graham convinces a deranged hospital orderly (Jonathan Tucker) to try to kill Lecter, but the attempt fails. Lecter retaliates by taking as his lover Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), a psychologist for whom Graham had romantic feelings. Lecter then exonerates Graham by planting forensic evidence of Graham's alleged victims at the scene of one of his own murders, resulting in Graham's release. He also frames his colleague Frederick Chilton (Raúl Esparza) by planting a mutilated corpse in his house and \"influencing\" his surviving victim Miriam Lass (Anna Chlumsky), into believing that Chilton had abducted and tortured her.\n\nGraham resumes therapy with Lecter as an attempt to entrap him. Lecter becomes aware of the ruse, but is fascinated by the experience and allows it to continue in an attempt to examine his connection with Graham, which quickly grows into a close bond. In an attempt to push Graham into becoming a killer, Lecter sends his psychotic former patient Randall Tier (Mark O'Brien) after him, and Graham kills and mutilates Tier – just as Lecter hoped he would. Later, Graham attacks tabloid reporter Fredericka \"Freddy\" Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki), who is investigating him and Lecter. Graham shares a meal with Lecter of what is implied to be her flesh, but it is soon revealed that Lounds is still alive and conspiring with Graham and Crawford to draw Lecter into their trap.\n\nLecter and Graham acquire a common enemy in Mason Verger (Michael Pitt), a wealthy sadist whom they both despise for emotionally and sexually abusing his twin sister Margot (Katharine Isabelle). Verger makes a deal with Graham to kill Lecter, secretly planning to feed them both to his prize pigs; however, Graham changes his mind and frees Lecter, allowing them both to escape. Lecter then takes Verger hostage in Graham's house. He gives him a hallucinogenic drug cocktail, and tells him to cut off pieces of his own face and feed them to Graham's dogs. With Graham's tacit approval, Lecter then breaks Verger's neck with his bare hands, paralyzing him.\n\nIn the second-season finale, Crawford arrives at Lecter's house to arrest him. In the ensuing struggle, Lecter seriously wounds Crawford, while a very much alive Abigail Hobbs pushes Bloom out of a window. Lecter then stabs Graham and cuts Abigail's throat in front of him, and leaves them as he flees before the police arrive. He is shown in a post-credits scene aboard a flight to France with his psychiatrist, Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson).\n\nThe third season amends the series' continuity to incorporate events from the novel \"Hannibal\". It also changes Lecter's origin story: in this continuity, Lecter's sister Mischa was murdered, cannibalized, and fed to him by a peasant in his native Lithuania, who would eventually become his prisoner. Certain episodes also suggest that, in his youth, Lecter was the unidentified serial killer known as \"The Monster of Florence\".\n\nMonths after his escape, Lecter is living in Florence with Du Maurier, working as a museum curator under the alias \"Dr. Fell\" – having murdered the original curator and stolen his identity. Disgraced Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Fortunato Cerlino) tries to apprehend him to collect a bounty placed by Mason Verger (Joe Anderson), who is also consulting with Bloom to capture Lecter. Lecter kills Pazzi and tries to flee the country, but is accosted by Crawford, who engages him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Meanwhile, Graham goes looking for Lecter with the help of the doctor's family servant Chiyoh (Tao Okamoto), traveling to his adversary's home country to find out more about him.\n\nLecter manages to escape from Crawford and meet up with Graham when he arrives to Italy again. Graham makes peace with Lecter before pulling a knife on him, but Chiyoh shoots and wounds Graham. Lecter takes Graham back to his villa and tries to perform a craniotomy on him in front of Crawford, but is interrupted by Italian detectives on Verger's payroll, who deliver them both to Verger's estate in Maryland. Verger's physician Cordell Doemling (Glenn Fleshler) tells Lecter that he will mutilate him until he dies, and prepare gourmet cuisine from his flesh for Verger to eat. Influenced by Graham, Bloom frees Lecter, who suggests that Margot kill her brother, promising to take the blame. Lecter then kills Doemling, who is about to surgically remove Graham's face and graft it onto Verger's, and later instructs Margot and Bloom on how to milk the unconscious Verger's prostate to give Margot the sperm she needs to conceive a child and thus inherit the Verger family fortune. After Margot kills her brother, Lecter goes to Graham's house, carrying wounded and unconscious Graham. When Graham wakes up, he allows Lecter to escape, but later that evening Lecter surrenders to Crawford, who takes him into custody.\n\nLecter is found insane at his trial, and incarcerated in the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane, under Chilton and Bloom's care. Three years later, Graham visits him at the hospital to ask for help in profiling a serial killer dubbed \"The Tooth Fairy\", who murders entire families. Lecter begins communicating with the killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Richard Armitage) and gives him Graham's home address. Dolarhyde attacks and wounds Graham's wife, Molly (Nina Arianda). Bloom and Crawford threaten to take away Lecter's hospital privileges unless he lets them listen in on his conversations with Dolarhyde. Lecter complies, but then suddenly tells Dolarhyde they are listening. Bloom punishes him by taking away his books and toilet, and confining him in a straitjacket and muzzle. Graham, in an attempt to make Dolarhyde come out of hiding, gives an interview with Chilton and Lounds in which he describes \"The Tooth Fairy\" as ugly, impotent, and a product of incest. Dolarhyde, enraged by the \"bad review\", abducts, burns and disfigures Chilton, and sends Lecter Chilton's severed lips, one of which Lecter eats.\n\nIn the series finale, \"The Wrath of the Lamb\", Lecter and Graham develop a plan to catch Dolarhyde, using Lecter as bait. Lecter goes with Graham on a police convoy, to be transferred to another facility in order to eventually draw the killer out. However, Graham has made a deal with Dolarhyde to free Lecter, and Dolarhyde attacks the convoy, killing the guards and letting Lecter and Graham live. Lecter then takes Graham to a secluded clifftop cottage where he previously held Abigail Hobbs and Miriam Lass. Dolarhyde tracks them down and attacks them, shooting Lecter in the back and stabbing Graham in the face. Though they are both badly wounded, Lecter and Graham manage to get the better of Dolarhyde and kill him together: Graham slices open Dolarhyde's chest, while Lecter tears out his throat with his teeth. Lecter and Graham then embrace, before Graham pushes them both off a cliff. Their ultimate fate is left ambiguous; a post-credits scene shows Du Maurier dining on her own leg at a table set for three. Series creator Bryan Fuller has said this scene is meant to suggest that Lecter and Graham survived and that Graham has become Lecter's partner in murder. Fuller has stated that Season 4 would have depicted Lecter and Graham on the run from the FBI in Argentina, mirroring Lecter and Starling's storyline from the novels.\n\nThe emotional relationship between Graham and Lecter forms the foundation of the series. In season 3, their developing romance has been taken from subtext into text. As to whether it was a part of the initial plan to portray their relationship as romantic, Fuller stated: \"No, it naturally evolved because I guess I was absorbing so much of Mads and Hugh's performance, which felt like it was growing in intimacy, and it would have been inauthentic not to address it. Because all of these characters, and particularly Bedelia, was able to call out what she had witnessed [between Lecter and Graham], it seemed like a natural conclusion. I remember when I turned in the rewrite pages where Will asks Bedelia if Hannibal is in love with him, I got a note from Don Mancini, one of our writers who was always pushing for more homosexual text – not just context or subtext but text, text, text – and he was like, \"I'm so glad you put that in there! They said it! They said it!\" Discussing what motivated him to verbally acknowledge the romance between Graham and Lecter, Fuller said, \"It felt like we had to shit or get off the pot, ultimately, because there had been so much going on between these two men that when Will asks, \"Is Hannibal Lecter in love with me?\" it is very much about death and the romance between these two men. There is a quality to connections that go above and beyond sexuality. You can have this intimate connection with somebody that then causes you to wonder where the lines of your own sexuality are. And we didn't quite broach the sexuality. It was certainly suggested, but the love is absolutely on the table.\" Remembering how the song for the finale of the series - \"Love Crime\" by Siouxsie Sioux - was created, Fuller said: \"It was interesting. She [Siouxsie Sioux] was like, \"I want to write this song, and what are the things I should really be thinking about?\" And I was like, 'this is a love story. A love story between a full-fledged psychopath and someone who has nascent psychopathic abilities.' Actually, Hannibal Lecter is not a psychopath; he's something else entirely. But it's a love relationship between two men: one of them is a cannibal, and one of them understands those cannibalistic instincts all too well.\" \n\nHannibal Lecter is parodied in the 2005 musical, \"SILENCE! The Musical\", with the character being originated by actor Brent Barrett.\n\nThomas Harris has given few interviews and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid-2013. Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in the city of Monterrey during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s when he was a 23-year-old reporter. The doctor was serving a life sentence for murdering a young man, supposedly a \"close friend\", mutilating his body into several body parts, and putting them in a very small box. Harris, who would only refer to the surgeon by the fake name \"Dr. Salazar\", described him as a \"small lithe pale man with dark red hair\". He added: \"There was certain intelligence and elegance about him.\" Harris had gone to Mexico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a US citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country, but he ended up also speaking to \"Salazar\", who saved Simmons' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid. \"Salazar\" revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons' disfigured face, tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been.\n\nSeveral reporters and investigators have traced the records and whereabouts of the Mexican prison doctor in later years and discovered that \"Salazar\" was in reality Alfredo Ballí Treviño, a physician from an upper-class Monterrey family who was found guilty of murdering a close friend (and lover) and mutilating his body; he was also suspected of killing and dismembering several hitchhikers in the city outskirts during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Harris also incorporated some of these details into Buffalo Bill's development as a killer in \"Silence of the Lambs\". Ballí was initially condemned to death, but his sentence was later commuted to 20 years and he was released in 1981. After his release, Ballí continued working as a physician in an austere office until his death by natural causes in 2009.\n\nIn her book \"Evil Serial Killers\", Charlotte Greig asserts that the serial killer Albert Fish was the inspiration, at least in part, for Lecter. Greig also states that to explain Lecter's pathology, Harris borrowed the story of serial killer and cannibal Andrei Chikatilo's brother Stepan being kidnapped and eaten by starving neighbors (though she states that it is unclear whether the story was true or whether Stepan Chikatilo even existed). The location of the book \"Hannibal\" was inspired by The Monster of Florence. While preparing the book, Harris traveled to Italy and was present at the trial of the main suspect, Pietro Pacciani, where he was seen taking notes.\n\n"}

He was married to Aimée, a former teacher in Chicago.\n\nHe was born in Toronto, Canada West to a Methodist family but several years later his family moved to Wingham, Ontario. Jackson later attended the University of Toronto for 3 years; however, due to his fathers bankruptcy, he was unable to complete his last year. In 1881 he moved to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan (then part of the Northwest Territories), where he soon began to sympathize with the Métis and their struggle against the Canadian government, though he was not a Métis himself. Jackson became personal secretary to Louis Riel when Riel returned to Canada in 1884, and the two organized a Métis militia and made plans for a provisional government. Open fighting broke out between the disgruntled Metis and police forces/armed civilian volunteers on March 18 at Duck Lake.\n\nThat same day (18 March 1885), Jackson was baptised Catholic by Father Fourmond. Riel stood as godfather for the ceremony and gave him the name \"Honoré Joseph Jaxon\". The next day Riel declared the establishment of a provisional government (see Exovedate).\n\nHowever, Jackson's mental health was affected by the religious event, and by the turmoil and excitement of open rebellion, and within days, Riel imprisoned Jackson, perhaps thinking he had gone insane but also fearing that his eccentric religious ideas and his support for Henry George's radical philosophical ideas against private ownership of land may cause discord within his (Riel's) followers. Later during the rebellion, Riel released Jackson.\n\nHe was captured when Canadian government troops overcame the last Metis resistance in the Battle of Batoche ending on May 12, 1885. He was tried for treason, but found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to an insane asylum in Lower Fort Garry, near Winnipeg, Manitoba. He escaped the asylum on November 2 and fled to the United States.\n\nOnce there, he changed his name to Honoré Jaxon and joined the labour union movement in Chicago, Illinois and was active in socialist circles as well. He also decided to lie about his identity and told others he was a Métis. In 1894 he was part of Coxey's Army, which marched to Washington, DC to demand an eight-hour workday. In 1897 he converted to the Bahá'í Faith and oriented his concerns to Canada.\n\nHe returned to Canada briefly between 1907-1909, spending some of the time interviewing former participants of the Rebellion and addressing labour/socialist meetings. He returned to the United States, eventually moving to New York City. He collected books, newspapers, and pamphlets relating to the Métis people in an attempt to establish in their honour a museum in New York. However, years went by and he slipped into poverty and extreme old age. He was evicted from his apartment on December 12, 1951, and his collection (considered unimportant by the city) was sold as waste paper. He died a month later.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15216953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15216953", "title": "Isatai'i", "text": "Isatai'i\n\nIsatai'i (Comanche \"isa\" 'wolf or coyote' + \"tai'i\" 'vagina') or Isatai (c.1840 – 1916) was a Comanche warrior and medicine man of the Kwaharʉ band. Originally named Kwihnai Tosabitʉ (White Eagle), after the debacle at Adobe Walls on June 27, 1874, for which he was blamed, he was known as Isatai'i. Isatai'i gained enormous prominence for a brief period in 1873-74 as a prophet and \"messiah\" of Native Americans. He succeeded, albeit very temporarily, in uniting the autonomous Comanche bands as no previous Chief or leader had ever done. Indeed, his prestige was such that he was able to organize what was said to be the first Comanche sun dance, an Indian ritual that his tribe had not previously adopted.\n\nNot much is known about Isatai'i’s youth. He was born a Kwaharʉ Comanche, a few years before Quanah Parker, probably about 1840. As an adult he became a medicine man, not a traditional warrior. He first came into prominence right before the Second Battle of Adobe Walls as he preached a Messianic War against buffalo hunters and other whites he feared were ending the Comanche way of life. Isatai'i's prophecies were based on his claim that he had ascended far above the earth into the clouds and had conversed with the Great Spirit. He claimed the Great Spirit had granted him extraordinary powers. Among these powers were the ability to cure the sick, bring the dead back to life, to control the weather and other natural phenomena, and to make bullets fall to the ground, harming no one. He claimed that he could belch up bullets and cartridges, and reswallow same. He correctly predicted the disappearance of the comet in 1873, and also correctly predicted a drought that year—predictions that solidified his status as a miracle worker, prophet, and medicine man.\n\nIsatai'i brought all the bands of the Comanches together for the sun dance in May 1874. At the sun dance, he began preaching a war of revenge and extermination, and told the warriors they would be invulnerable to their enemies. Comanche history says that Isatai'i’s hatred of the whites was motivated by the deaths of family members at their hands.\n\nIt is notable that members of other tribes, mainly the Kiowas and Cheyennes, found his message appealing. At first, the Comanche wished to exterminate the Tonkawas, long allies and scouts for the hated Texas Rangers. But disregarding that plan as secondary to the need of saving the buffalo, then approaching extermination at the hands of white hunters, the Comanches decided to attack the hunters in the Texas Panhandle, who were destroying the buffalo and thereby endangering the Native American Plains tribes' chief source of food. On June 27 a party of 250 - 1000 Indians, primarily all the bands of the Comanches, but including Kiowa and Cheyenne, attacked the buffalo hunters who were camping at the old trading post of Adobe Walls, on the South Canadian River. During the battle, led primarily by the young Comanche Quanah Parker, Isatai'i remained at least a mile away on a distant hill. The buffalo hunters, twenty-eight men and one woman, protected by the solid adobe walls and armed with long-range rifles, fought off the Indians and finally compelled them to withdraw. It was during this battle that Billy Dixon made what may be the most famous rifle shot of the west, hitting a Comanche chief one mile (1.6 km) away.\n\nAbout fifteen warriors were killed and a larger number wounded, including Quanah Parker.\n\nIsatai'i tried to absolve himself of the blame for the disastrous defeat by claiming that his magic had been weakened before the battle when one of the Cheyennes violated a sacred taboo by killing a skunk. The Cheyennes took this poorly, especially the Dog Soldiers, and responded by beating him severely. Isatai'i was discredited and publicly humiliated.\n\nAlthough many military historians do not consider the Second Battle of Adobe Walls a major historic engagement, it was a crushing spiritual defeat for the Southern Plains Indians, who had come to believe fully in the superhuman prophetic powers of the medicine man, and being driven off by civilian buffalo hunters certainly marked the end of their time as any sort of military power. Within a year, the Comanche and Kiowa were all on the reservation.\n\n"}

He enrolled in college, but dropped out in 1969 for several semesters. He then went back to college and studied subjects including English, journalism, and engineering, before transferring to UCLA to major in economics. He originally planned to get an economics PhD and become a professor. He then switched to studying theater, playwriting, modern dance and jazz dance, partly because there were more women in those classes. He is of Italian ancestry with some of his grandparents from Florence.\n\nIn the 1970s, he wrote erotic fiction for a small newspaper, and did some softcore modeling. He made his debut in a hardcore pornographic film in an 8mm loop in 1974. In 1979, he was looking for dancing jobs in Hollywood. He replied to an advertisement in the \"Daily Variety\" looking for male strippers for the new Chippendales show. He performed with the group four or five nights a week for the next four years. In 1982, when he was 30, he began publishing a small pornographic magazine on newsprint, which he called \"Evil Angel\".\n\nInitially he had little knowledge of film making, but he made his first movie for $8,000 in 1983, titled \"Bouncing Buns\", starring Stacy Donovan. For the next six years he made films for other companies to manufacture and distribute. In 1989, he started Evil Angel to sell his own films. The origin of the company's name dates back to when Stagliano was working as a stripper. \"There was another guy in one of my shows named John. So this MC started calling me Evil John to differentiate us. This was when I was doing Dracula and chains. At the same time I had a girlfriend who called herself Angel when she did strip shows. She was a very nasty girl and I suggested that she call herself Evil Angel. She didn't, but I loved the name and wound up using it for my company.\"\n\nThe first Evil Angel film was \"Dance Fire\", filmed in 1988 by Stagliano, starring himself, Trinity Loren, Brandy Alexandre and others.\n\nIn 1989, he produced \"The Adventures of Buttman,\" the first in a popular series which is credited with sparking the \"gonzo\" adult film genre. These films involved highlighting the female buttocks, with actors often licking, kissing and playfully biting the female behind. Stagliano has stated that a scene showing Tracey Adams' buttocks inspired him to make the \"Buttman\" series of films. The clip shows Adams on her hands and knees with her rear end stuck high in the air. \"The shot only lasted a couple of seconds,\" says Stagliano, \"but I knew then what I wanted to do.\" Early Stagliano productions had little to no anal sex in them and were critically acclaimed for the showcasing of his buttocks fetish. Later \"Buttman\" films included numerous anal sex scenes, often featuring Stagliano himself. In the 1990s, Stagliano became one of the most successful figures in American pornographic films.\nHe has directed series including \"Buttman at Nudes a Poppin'\", \"Buttman Goes to Rio\", \"Buttman's Anal Divas\", \"Buttman's Anal Show\", \"Buttman's Bend Over Babes\", \"Buttman's Bend Over Brazilian Babes\", \"Buttman's Big Butt Backdoor Babes\", \"Buttman's Big Tit Adventure\", \"Buttman's Butt Freak\", \"Buttman's European Vacation\", \"Buttman's Favorite Big Butt Babes\", \"Face Dance\" and \"Fashionistas\", as well as numerous one-off films. Stagliano also served as mentor, producer, and co-director to Tristan Taormino in her video version of \"The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women\".\n\nFrom October 2004 through February 2008, Stagliano produced and directed a Las Vegas show called Fashionistas based on his porn film of the same name. In 2008, he won the 'Best Director - Video' award for \"Fashionistas Safado: Berlin\". (\"Safado\" is a Portuguese word meaning lewd or salacious.)\n\nStagliano was described by \"U.S. News and World Report\" magazine in 1998 as \"the nation's leading director of hard-core videos.\"\n\nOn April 8, 2008, Evil Angel and Stagliano were indicted on federal obscenity charges by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. The scenes selected by the government to support the prosecution involved urination, use of enemas, and bondage.\nOn July 16, 2010, a federal trial began in Washington, D.C. with Stagliano as defendant and after three days all charges were dismissed. Judge Richard J. Leon stated, \"I hope the government will learn a lesson from its experience,\" and called the evidence linking Stagliano to the production and distribution of the DVD videos \"woefully insufficient\". Although he dismissed the charges on the grounds of insufficient evidence, the judge cited the \"difficult, challenging and novel questions\" raised in the case against Stagliano, questions concerning extant federal obscenity-statutes, the internet, free speech, and the rights of criminal defendants.

According to the lawsuit, Summers consented to Stagliano engaging in sexual contact within the context of her acting in an adult film. In the scene, Stagliano can be seen handing Summers sex toys and touching her buttocks, but he does not perform hardcore sex with her. Summers claims that had she known of Stagliano's status prior to the scene that she would not have done it.\n\nIn a press interview, Stagliano's wife Karen disputes the allegations: \"John and the company feel that he did not do anything with Katie Summers that would warrant having to inform her of his HIV status,\" Karen said \"He had no genital contact with her, no sexual touching of her genitals at all that would have put her at any sort of a medical risk whatsoever.\"\n\nThe suit against Stagliano went into forced arbitration and the plaintiff had her deposition taken, but on 29 September 2014 Summers dropped her lawsuit. According to Stagliano's attorney, Paul Cambria, \"[Summers] had no case. I took her testimony and when I was done I could not see any possible way for her to succeed.\"\n\nIn her essay \"Crackers and Whackers: The White Trash of Porn,\" which among other things brings into relief the heritage of bawdy songs, the related oral culture of joke telling, and the \"bawdy, farcical character\" of early stag films in modern porn, Constance Penley, exclaiming that after its golden era passed, porn became \"wonderfully trashy again,\" asserts that John Stagliano did for anal fetishism what Woody Allen did for neurosis, pointing out that, \"as in so many stag films,\" Buttman is the \"butt of the joke\" since, \"seeking the perfect shot of a woman's perfect ass,\" the character \"gets mugged, evicted, bankrupted, rejected, and ridiculed –  all in his single-minded quest for perfection.\"\n\n\nStagliano was in a relationship with pornographic actress Krysti Lynn (aka Shawna Yager) during 1993. She was driving Stagliano's Acura Legend when she died on December 7, 1995, in an accident in Calabasas.\n\nIn 1997, Stagliano tested positive for HIV. As of 2002, medication has kept the virus in check.\n\nHe married former porn star Tricia Devereaux (Karen Stagliano) in 2008. Stagliano espouses a libertarian political philosophy, and has been a significant financial contributor to the Cato Institute and the Reason Foundation, both libertarian think tanks.\n\n"}

She worked at Fidel Castro's headquarters in Havana as a translator and public relations worker in 1959 and 1960. After leaving Cuba, Cobb continued working for the CIA in Guatemala and Mexico. She was the first CIA asset to relay an account of Lee Harvey Oswald having attended a twist party in Mexico City weeks before the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Earlier in the 1950s, Cobb was involved with the production and trafficking of narcotics with her Colombian fiancé and his twin brother. She later provided information to the US Federal Bureau of Narcotics that led to arrests in Cuba and Colombia.\n\nCobb was fluent in Spanish, notably translating Castro's \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech and former Guatemalan president Juan José Arévalo's short story \"The Shark and the Sardines\".\n\nViola June Cobb was born on August 24, 1927 in Ponca City, Oklahoma to Jasper E. Cobb and Jesse Lois Sharp. She graduated from Ponca City High School, and went on to attend University of Oklahoma for one year in the mid-1940s. She then worked at a Ponca City radio station and for a local newspaper as a courthouse reporter. She was an adjunct of the Civil Air Patrol squadron in Norman, Oklahoma, attaining the rank of 2nd class Lieutenant.\n\nAfter leaving the University of Oklahoma, Cobb traveled to Mexico, where she met Rafael Herran Olozaga, who was from a wealthy and politically-connected Colombian family. Both his great-grandfather, Pedro Alcántara Herrán, and his great-great-grandfather, Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, had served as Presidents of Colombia. His family disapproved of the relationship, considering Cobb beneath his station. They were later engaged.\n\nCobb took extension classes with Olozaga at the National University in Mexico City in 1947. In Mexico, she worked for an oil firm in public relations. She also edited \"Modern Mexico\", a Mexican Chamber of Commerce publication.\n\nIn 1948, Cobb traveled with Olozaga and his twin brother Tomas to Colombia. The brothers had plans to cultivate and traffic opium. By 1949, they were on a six-month expedition in the Ecuadorian jungle where they were engaged in cocaine production. Cobb worked for Pan American Airways and was a public relations employee in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Six months later, Cobb was back in Colombia. She returned to Oklahoma in 1950 and spent around ten months living with her father, working as a news reporter in Kay County.\n\nCobb returned to Colombia in 1951 and contracted leishmaniasis, a rare tropical disease. She returned to the United States for treatment, spending several months hospitalized at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. After she recovered, she spent five months working at the hospital as an administrative assistant for Dr. Isidore Snapper. In early 1952, Cobb began a relationship with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. During the summer of 1952, she was employed with \"Time\" magazine in their letters department. Cobb then moved to Chicago and worked as a secretary again for Snapper, who was now the director of medical education at Cook County Hospital.\n\nCobb returned to New York City in 1953 and found work as an interpreter and translator. Her friend Warren Broglie, manager of the Waldorf Astoria, referred clients to her. Towards the end of 1953, Cobb worked briefly for Foster Wheeler, a firm that was building a refinery in Colombia. In the summer of 1954, Cobb was treated for agranulocytosis at Beth-El Hospital in New York.\n\nBy 1955, Cobb was traveling in Latin America. In 1956, she worked for the Colombian-American Culture Foundation in Medellin and taught briefly at the American school.\n\nIn December 1956, the Olozaga brothers were arrested in Havana for possession and distribution of heroin. The pair were apprehended by Cuban law enforcement officials, with the assistance of US FBN agents, a day after Cobb had left Cuba for Coral Gables, Florida. Cobb had traveled with the brothers to Havana to help them sell several grams of heroin and several ounces of cocaine. The brothers were released quickly, owing to their family connections. In a joint operation of the FBN and the Colombian Intelligence Service, the brothers were arrested again in Medellin, Colombia in February 1957 for running a cocaine laboratory on their parents' estate. FBN agent George Gaffney later recalled that the 1957 operation originated in New Orleans when \"a woman with CIA connections offered information\" to an agent.\n\nIn 1957, Cobb briefly worked as a secretary for county attorney Ralph Haynes.\n\nFor a time in 1958, Cobb was acquainted with Dimitre Dimitrov, a Bulgarian politician who had been imprisoned in Greece and interrogated by the CIA as part of Project ARTICHOKE.\n\nBy 1959, Cobb had moved to New York City. She lived briefly at the Hotel Iroquois.\n\nCobb visited Havana in February 1959 and later recounted meeting with Fidel Castro's Minister of Health regarding their campaign against vice and cooperation with doctors from Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia against the use of coca leaves. During her trip she was given a copy of Castro's 1953 \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech. When she returned to the United States, she set about translating the speech to English. Cuban journalist Luis Conte Agüero learned of the translation and visited Cobb in New York. He wrote a prologue for the booklet and assisted with printing costs.\n\nAfter Castro was sworn in as Cuba's Prime Minister, he visited the United States in April 1959. One evening in New York, Cobb accompanied Agüero to the Statler Hotel where she was introduced to Castro. She had brought a copy of the translated speech. Castro was pleased when he saw the booklet she had made and ordered a print run of 1,000 copies to be made and distributed in New York. Cobb also met Castro's private secretary Celia Sánchez, who invited her to Havana to work under Castro in the Ministry Office.\n\nCobb agreed, traveling to Cuba afterwards. Her duties in Havana included translating Castro's speeches and working as a public relations assistant. She also translated Castro's new land reform laws into English. She worked on the 18th floor, down the hall from Castro's office. She and William Alexander Morgan were the only Americans to gain any sort of influence in the new regime.\n\nCobb returned to the United States in June 1959, and again for medical treatment in September and December of that year. While recuperating from surgery, Cobb stayed at a beach house owned by Castro and Sánchez.\n\nCobb disagreed with Castro openly over his turn to authoritarianism and Marxism, her anger becoming evident as the Communist influence on him became obvious. Cobb had hoped that a cessation in the US bombing of Cuban cane fields would prevent Castro's turn towards dictatorship.\n\nIn early 1960, during Castro's second trip to New York, tabloids reported that 17-year-old Marita Lorenz had been raped by the Cuban leader. She was pregnant, and Cobb later said that the father was Castro's bodyguard, Jesus Yanez Pelletier. Lorenz's mother later reported that Cobb had called her and offered her employment if she would return to Cuba with her daughter. Che Guevara conducted an investigation of the incident and Cobb was included in a roundup of the suspects. She was protected by Castro and Sánchez, but the relationship cooled and she lost the access she had had before.\n\nCIA agent Harry Hermsdorf, undercover as a European journalist in Cuba, first met Cobb in the Havana Hilton's hotel coffee shop while having coffee with Jorge Losada, the editor of \"Vision\", a Latin American magazine. Losada introduced Cobb to Hermsdorf, who was using the alias Heinrich Heubner. Following a brief conversation, Cobb agreed to arrange meetings with Cuban officials for Hermsdorf and \"Der Spiegel\" correspondent Claus Jacobi.\n\nFrom May 24–26, 1960, Cobb met with Hermsdorf, who evaluated her at her hotel. Without mentioning the CIA, he offered her a long-term employment opportunity and invited her to meet him somewhere outside of Cuba. They arranged to meet at the Drake Hotel in New York on June 3. Cobb traveled to the United States in early June 1960. She also stopped in Washington, D.C., where she stayed at the Raleigh Hotel. The CIA arranged surveillance of her hotel room and of a polygraph that she took.\n\nCobb made a verbal agreement to work for the CIA and returned to Havana on June 7, and was to be paid 200 Cuban pesos per month plus expenses. Jean T. Pierson was designated her CIA handler. Hermsdorf asked Cobb to monitor the activities of the chief of Prensa Latina and the head of the Free China News Agency. He also requested that she determine what Antonio Núñez Jiménez had accomplished on his recent trip to the Soviet Union and pass on the \"names and contacts of Soviet and satellite citizens\" who dealt with the Cuban government. In a June CIA memo from Hermsdorf, he wrote \"If Miss Cobb can be controlled and accepts steering, it would perhaps be desirable to mould her into a long-range asset by having her become very cozy with the communist leaders and become, overtly, ever more 'rabid' about the revolutionary movement. Later she could perhaps be used elsewhere in Latin America, probably among the rabid left wing youth groups that are becoming increasingly anti-American and more powerful in various areas.\"\n\nCobb left Cuba in September 1960, and on September 12 formalized her contract with the CIA, which stipulated that she received $200 each month for a year-long operation, called JMARC, \"to penetrate the Cuban government in an effort to obtain information on present and planned activities of the Castro regime.\" Cobb was given the cryptonym AMUPAS-1. From September 21 to 29, the CIA maintained surveillance of Cobb's hotel room in New York City. Cobb was acquainted with Kennedy advisor Richard N. Goodwin, and soon had direct access to the White House through him.\n\nWhile in Havana, one more than one occasion, Cobb met with CIA operative David Sánchez Morales at the house of Geraldine Shamma.\n\nCobb's first CIA operation involved befriending CBS newscaster Richard Gibson, a co-founder of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Cobb determined that Gibson had made a trip to Cuba, met with Castro and Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, and received money for operating expenses and to maintain the FPCC New York office. In later testimony, Cobb said that she had firsthand knowledge that Cuba was funding the committee. During 1961, Gibson wrote a number of letters to Cobb.\n\nAround 1961, alongside Raul Osegueda, Cobb translated former Guatemalan President Juan José Arévalo's 1956 allegory \"The Shark and the Sardines\" to English. From Mexico, Cobb assisted Guatemalan revolutionaries fighting Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, helping them obtain equipment. She was deported by the Guatemalan police on November 9, 1961. CIA Mexico City cables related that Cobb was deported with Achilles Centeno Perez. Guatemalan border officials told them they would be killed if they returned to the country. Cobb's entry to Mexico was assisted by George Frederick Munro, whose family maintained a ranch in Cuernavaca that Cobb said she visited several times. Munro advised Cobb against returning to Guatemala, where she wanted to complete an undisclosed task on behalf of the CIA.\n\nIn March 1962, Cobb was called to testify before an executive session of the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. Prior to her appearance, She did not reveal her association with the CIA and members of the subcommittee appeared unaware of the fact.\n\nAn August 12, 1962 article by Jack Anderson in \"Parade\" magazine painted Cobb as a \"soldier of fortune\", detailing her time working for Castro and her involvement with drug trafficking in Latin America.\n\nIn June 1963, the CIA reapproved Cobb as an informant for WH/3-Mexico D.F., despite an October 1962 CIA security memo recommending no contact with her other than assessment. Later that year, Cobb was transferred to Mexico City and her cryptonym was changed to LICOOKY-1.\n\nCobb then moved to Mexico City. She was a CIA asset for the Mexico City station, reporting to David Atlee Phillips. Warren Broglie, who was then managing Hotel Luma, passed information to Cobb that she relayed to station chief Winston M. Scott. When she was in need of a residence, her friend Eunice Odio suggested she call Elena Garro.\n\nFollowing the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, and the release of the Warren Report, Cobb was privy to a conversation between Elena Garro, her sister Deva Guerrero, and her daughter. They expressed surprise at seeing Oswald's face in the newspapers, as they said they recognized him from a twist party at the home of Rubén Durán. They said that he was accompanied by two other men who looked like beatniks. In an October 5 report, Cobb informed the CIA of the conversation. Cobb wanted the women to tell American authorities what they knew, but advised them against going to the American embassy, instead suggesting that they go to Texas. Cobb was asked to leave Garro's home after their cat's back legs were found broken.\n\nOswald had checked out a copy of \"The Shark and the Sardines\" from the Dallas Public Library on about November 6, 1963. The book had not been returned.\n\nAs of December 1965, Cobb was roommates with Eunice Odio. In 1965 and 1966, Cobb set up Milton Abramson, a New York-based drug trafficker, Adela Castillo, and others for arrest by the FBI in the United States.\n\nCobb lived at a Manhattan senior center prior to her death on October 17, 2015.\n\nThe CIA's extensive file on Cobb is estimated to include over 2,500 pages. Following the Kennedy assassination, all of the documents related to Cobb's work with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics were marked secret. Following the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, many of the documents have been declassified. Some of the Warren Commission's declassified files indicate that the CIA, in the late 1970s, refused to help House Select Committee on Assassinations investigators locate Cobb for an interview about Oswald's activities in Mexico.\n\nFurther documents concerning Cobb that are related to the assassination were scheduled to be released under the JFK Records Act in October 2017. The National Archives and Records Administration announced that it was preparing a 221-page file of documents related to Cobb.\n\n\n"}

They were ordered to pay fines and compensation of $AUD1.1 million. After the Australian government intervened on their behalf, Kerry and Kay Danes were provisionally released on 6 October 2001. The pair signed a formal agreement to pay their fines by instalments, and a presidential pardon was granted on 6 November 2001 which enabled their return to Australia.\n\nThe Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) is one of the world's least developed communist countries. In 1994, Laos was the world's third largest producer of opium, primarily in the northern provinces. Much of this predominantly Buddhist landlocked socialist state lacks adequate infrastructure. The Lao People's Armed Forces (LPAF) is small, poorly funded, and ineffectively resourced. Its mission focus is border and internal security, primarily in internal suppression of Laotian dissident and opposition groups. The Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) is the only legal political party. In 1991, a new constitution was adopted and enshrined a leading role for the LPRP. \n\nIn 1994, Bjarne (Bernie) Jeppesen (Denmark) and his wife Julie Bruns (New Zealand) founded Gem Mining Lao PDR (GML) with Lao-born American, Somkhit Vilavong. They were granted a fifteen year concession from the Lao government to mine at Huay Xai, a small city located in the north, which lies on the east of the Mekong just over the river border from Chiang Khong, Thailand near the Golden Triangle. In May 2000, Jeppesen and his wife fled Laos amidst charges of embezzlement. The Lao Government terminated GML’s mining concession and then nationalized GML’s sapphire mines. Jeppesen's caretakers, Kerry and Kay Danes, were arrested later the same year. \n\nBy the end of 2000, Warrant Officer (WO) Kerry Danes, a Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) soldier on extended leave from the Australian Army, had been living for two years in the capital city Vientiane. According to American gem expert Richard W. Hughes , Danes was general manager of \"Lao Securicor\" (a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited), a company that provided a security guard for the Vientiane office of the country's biggest sapphire mine, Gem Mining Lao (GML). Amidst allegations of missing gems, the registered owners and founders/executives of GML had been prohibited from leaving Laos. Security contractor Kerry Danes formally agreed to handle all affairs for GML prior to two of their founders fleeing Laos on 28 May 2000 to Bangkok, Thailand (and later Denmark). More than 450 Laotian employees of GML lost their jobs. The Lao government later convicted the fugitive GML pair (who never returned) in absentia for theft and misappropriations related to GML, and sentenced them to twenty years imprisonment. According to Bernie Jeppesen (GML), Danes' subsequent problem resulted from his association with Gem Mining Lao.\n\nKerry Danes formally agreed to handle all affairs for GML when two of its founders, Jeppeson and Bruns, unlawfully fled Laos to Thailand on 28 May 2000. Danes also co-signed a letter from Jeppesen accusing members of the Lao government of corruption. Two months after the departure of Jeppeson and Bruns, quantities of Huay Sai sapphires allegedly appeared at Chanthaburi gem markets in Thailand. Danes was the managing director of Lao Securicor, a security company in charge of shipping gems for GML. In December 1999, the Lao government had ordered GML to suspend exports of all raw and semi-finished sapphire products. \n\nOn 23 December 2000, Kerry Danes (aged 42) was seized in his Vientiane office by Lao secret police on suspicion of involvement in the theft of over $US6 million worth of sapphires and cash from a gem mine that he had been hired to secure. Under Lao law, suspects could be held for up to twelve months before charges were laid. GML fugitive Bernie Jeppesen attributed Danes' problem to his association with Gem Mining Lao. \n\nDanes' wife, Kay (aged 33), worked as an office manager for Lao Securicor security company, which contracted to GML. She tried to flee the country on foot the same day with two of their three children (the third child, aged 14, was not in Laos), but was detained with $US52,700 cash at the nearby Laos-Thailand border by the head of Lao secret police. Under Lao law, suspects could be held for up to twelve months before charges were laid. The children, Sahra (aged 11) and Nathan Danes (aged 7), were released and with the aid of Australian consular staff, returned to Australia two days later on 25 December 2000 to stay with their grandparents in Brisbane. Kerry and Kay Danes were incarcerated in separate sections of mixed-sex Phonthong Prison, known as the 'Foreigners Prison', near Vientiane. On Christmas Day, Kay reportedly told her mother by mobile phone: \"Mum, I think by tomorrow I'll be dead.\" \n\nIn May 2001, the Danes’ Sydney-based lawyer said Kay's psychological condition was deteriorating, and she had developed a bad toothache in need of treatment. However, Kerry was physically and mentally strong. The case against the Danes centred on the transfer of a small fortune ($AUD200,000) to a Lao bank account in Kay Danes’ name. The transfer occurred about the time authorities alleged that finished and rough-cut sapphires worth millions of dollars disappeared from the office of a mining company that Danes provided security for. Soon after the Danes were detained, fugitive Bernie Jeppesen (GML) claimed that two dubious Australian characters (one notorious for money laundering and the other a disbarred lawyer) known as associates of murdered Melbourne lawyer/conman Max Green) were the main accusers against the Danes. \n\nIn June 2001, a Lao court convicted both Kerry and Kay Danes of embezzlement, tax evasion and destruction of evidence, sentenced each to seven years imprisonment, and ordered them to pay fines and compensation of $AUD1.1 million. The Australian government intervened on their behalf, and the Danes had served less than a total of ten months in prison when provisionally released on 6 October 2001. Not yet permitted to leave the country, the Danes decamped at the residence of Australian ambassador to Laos, Jonathan Thwaites. Laos authorities returned cash seized from Kay Danes and bank account funds of almost $200,000 ordered frozen at the time of the Danes' arrest. However, it was expected that such monies would be used to pay fines and compensation. \n\nIn large part due to Laos's strong ties with Australia, coupled with the fact that Kerry Danes was still enlisted as a full-time non-commissioned officer in the Australian Defence Force, the pair received a formal presidential pardon on 6 November 2001, which absolved them of their convictions. According to Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer, the Danes were advised they were free to leave Laos and welcome to return at any time if they wished. The couple flew back to Australia, and Kerry Danes returned to military service. \n\nAs a condition of release in October 2001, the Danes agreed to pay the June 2001 court-ordered $AUD1.1 million in fines and compensation in four equal instalments. When told that the Lao government was considering court action for non-payment in August 2002, Kay Danes argued on ABC Local Radio that the agreement was simply a diplomatic face-saving exercise, and she felt that the Australian government should intervene on their behalf again because she would be \"executed\" if forced to return to Laos. The Australian Foreign Minister's press secretary advised that the issue was a private legal matter between the Laos government and the Danes. Australia was obligated to pass on any court order issued in Laos, however no official documents had been received by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\nIn 2013, the producers of \"The Bodhi Tree\" film considered buying an option on Kay Danes' 2009 memoir \"Standing Ground: An Imprisoned Couple's Struggle for Justice Against a Communist Regime\" but later decided to base the film on two novels by British journalist Paul Conroy. \"The Bodhi Tree\" concentrates on the main story of lawyer Max Green, Australia's biggest legal fraudster, who embezzled millions of dollars and was later murdered in Cambodia. The smaller supporting story fictionalises the Danes in Laos. \n\nWO Kerry Danes (born 21 October 1958 Longreach, Queensland) resumed Australian military service after leaving Laos in 2001. His known overseas postings include Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and the West Bank. The compulsory retirement age for Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel is 60 years and 65 years for reservists. However, there is provision for the Minister for Defence or the Chief of the Defence Force to extend the compulsory retirement age for either a specific officer or member or a class of officers or members. Images of Danes can be viewed online, but these pictures appear to be either subject to copyright or are on websites that Wikipedia has blacklisted, such as Change.org: a for-profit site on which organisations pay to host and promote their petitions.\n\nKay Frances Stewart was born on 20 October 1967 in the Brisbane, Queensland suburb of Wynnum. She married Australian special forces soldier Kerry Danes and together they had three children: the first being born in 1986. The Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) is based at Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. In 1998, Kerry took extended leave without pay to try his luck in a civilian job in poverty-stricken Laos and enjoyed a relatively opulent comfortable expatriate lifestyle. His wife and three pre-teen children followed. Kay was engaged as an office manager for husband Kerry. In her memoirs, Kay Danes refers to herself as an adrenaline junkie and regarded Laos as an exciting adventure up until being jailed in December 2000. \n\nAt the start of Chapter 1 of her third memoir \"Families Behind Bars: Stories of Injustice, Endurance and Hope\" (2008), Kay Danes writes that she was also a director of a bodyguard company based in Thailand at the time she was detained in Laos in 2000. She claims to have hired out former elite military and police officers. Danes also asserts that she had access to the King of Thailand's own personal bodyguards, and she would sometimes provide close protection services to employers of her husband's security company in Laos. Opposite page 96 of her fourth memoir \"Standing Ground: An Imprisoned Couple's Struggle for Justice Against a Communist Regime\" (2009), Danes captions a picture of herself at Siem Reap airport on a covert surveillance assignment in 2000. Separately, Kay Danes' mother writes on page 43 of \"Families Behind Bars\" that Kay called her in Australia on Christmas Day 2000 on Kerry Danes' mobile phone after secretly concealing it during her first two days of imprisonment in Laos. No information is provided with respect to who else Kay Danes may have contacted.\n\nShortly after independence in 1953, a long civil war ended the monarchy. Since 1975, Laos has been a one-party socialist republic that espouses Marxism–Leninism. It is governed by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, in which the party leadership is dominated by military figures. As a multi-ethnic country, the politically and culturally dominant Lao people making up approximately fifty-five percent of the population, live mostly in the lowlands. Mon-Khmer groups, the Hmong and other indigenous hill tribes, accounting for the other forty-five percent, live in the foothills and mountains. From 1975 to 1996, the United States resettled some 250,000 Lao refugees from Thailand, including 130,000 Hmong. (See: Indochina refugee crisis) The government of Laos has been accused of committing genocide, and human rights and religious freedom violations against the Hmong ethnic minority within its own borders.\nAfter the Australian government successfully negotiated a Lao presidential pardon in 2001 on their behalf, Kerry and Kay Danes returned to Australia with their monies intact. Kerry resumed Australian military service. Kay found herself \"on a slippery slide of prescribed medications\" for quite a few years. The Danes reportedly experienced and witnessed daily incidents of torture and ill-treatment by Laotian authorities. . However, no description of ongoing physical injuries of their own can be found. In 2002, the Australian government declined to intervene when it was suggested that the Laos government was considering court action for non-payment of the $AUD1.1 million in fines and compensation that the Danes had agreed to pay by instalments when their presidential pardon was negotiated. Affected with post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic depression, Kay Danes released her first memoir \"Deliver Us From Evil : Bad Things Do Happen to Good People\" in 2002. \n\nBooks confer a sense of legitimacy, and conservative politicians sometimes invite authors to testify at congressional hearings. Danes was invited to speak the same year at the \"U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos\" in the United States House of Representatives and the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. Having found an appreciative audience, she testified on numerous occasions on Capitol Hill, and spoke at the National Press Club about human rights violations and the plight of political and foreign prisoners held in Laos. \n\nThe sense of injustice can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated. Danes continued writing and two more memoirs were released in 2006 and 2008. Danes testified in 2009 and 2011 at special sessions of the \"U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos\". Kay provided information about the Vientiane prison that she and husband Kerry were released from in 2001. Such information was considered in the context of the 2007 imprisonment of three missing Hmong-Americans In 2009, Danes published her fourth Lao memoir \"Standing Ground: An Imprisoned Couple's Struggle for Justice Against a Communist Regime\".\n\nKay Danes has published several memoirs based on her own personal experiences and observations. She is often promoted as an international author and speaker. The overarching theme of Danes' first four books (2002 - 2009), as indicated by the titles, is that of indignation. Her second memoir \"Nightmare in Laos : The True Story of a Woman Imprisoned in a Communist Gulag\" (2006) noticeably includes the word 'gulag' which, in English language use, commonly refers to any forced-labour camp in the Soviet Union. The dissolution of the Soviet Union ended the Cold War in 1991. Danes was incarcerated and pardoned some ten years later in a different part of the world. There are clearly anti-Laos and anti-communism sentiments that match American conservatism. A defensive attribution could be inferred. If Kerry and Kay Danes had served their full seven year prison sentences, they would have been due for release in December 2007. The writing of Laos memoirs ended not long after the seventh anniversary of being pardoned. Kay Danes has consistently mentioned suffering from diagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and this might explain mainstream media inconsistencies in basic facts such as the amount of time she was actually imprisoned and the associated circumstances.\n\n\nIn October / November 2008 (seven years after being pardoned in Laos), while Warrant Officer Kerry Danes was on a tour of duty with the Australian Army, his wife Kay took the opportunity to visit Afghanistan from Australia and travel in a Toyota Hiace van through war-torn countryside as part of a small group of five mixed-gender Rotarians under United States Marine Corps protection. In 2009, Kay Danes was named Citizen of the Year in her hometown. The following year, she published her fifth memoir \"Beneath the Pale Blue Burqa : One Woman's Journey Through Taliban Strongholds\". Chapter 1 names three women and two men on an organised two week road trip with an Afghanistani driver. On page 38, Kay Danes refers to herself as an adrenaline junkie. In the Acknowledgements, Danes writes how honoured she is being able to risk both life and limb on this adventure. \n\nIn 2011 (ten years after being pardoned in Laos), Kay Danes moved to Saudi Arabia when husband Kerry was deployed there with the Australian Defence Force. The following year, Kay was employed by the Australian government as an administrative assistant at its Embassy in Riyadh. In 2012, she was named State Finalist for Australian of the Year : an award conferred on an Australian citizen by the National Australia Day Council, a not-for-profit Australian Government owned social enterprise.\n\nSaudi Arabia is widely accused of having one of the worst human rights records in the world and remains one of the very few countries in the world not to accept the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Human rights issues that have attracted strong criticism include the extremely disadvantaged position of women, capital punishment for homosexuality, religious discrimination, the lack of religious freedom and the activities of the religious police. In 2004, the government approved the establishment of the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence.\n\nIn 2014 (thirteen years after being pardoned in Laos), Kay Frances Danes was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for social justice and human rights work The same year, she left the workforce in Saudi Arabia to complete a Master of Human Rights degree online through Curtin University (WA), and to also take advantage of the travel opportunities of the Middle East. There appears to be no readily accessible details of Kay Danes' undergraduate studies. Danes relocated to Australia in January 2015 and commenced a PhD (Law and Justice), researching how incidents of harm from major attacks have impacted Australian humanitarian workers in armed conflict. Kay Danes (born 1967) nominated 2019 for completion of her doctorate from Southern Cross University (SCU) on the Gold Coast, Queensland. A PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor or researcher. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "3931010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3931010", "title": "Machapunga", "text": "Machapunga\n\nThe Machapunga were a small Native American tribe of the Algonquian language family, one of a number in the territory of North Carolina. Previously they were known under the name Secotan. They were a group who had migrated south from the Algonquian peoples of the Powhatan Confederacy in present-day Virginia. They are now extinct as a separate tribe. They spoke an Algonquian language and historically occupied a coastal area of northeastern North Carolina.\n\nIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived along the waterways throughout the South. Over time they gave rise to the historical tribes known at the time of European encounter. Other peoples migrated into the area as well.\n\nThe early 20th-century ethnographer Frank Speck believed that the historical Machapunga and other Algonquian tribes in North Carolina had probably been earlier connected to the larger population based in coastal Virginia. He believed the tribes in North Carolina were part of an early and large Algonquian migration in a southerly direction in historical times. He noted the presence of Algonquian-speaking tribes on the Northeast coast and in eastern and central Canada.\n\nOne of a number of small, Algonquian-speaking tribes in coastal North Carolina, the \"Machapunga\" (meaning \"bad dust\" or \"much dirt,\" which sounds like an exonym given by a competing tribe, rather than an autonym they would identify with) lived in the Pungo River area. Many lived in a village called \"Mattamuskeet\" on the shore of Lake Mattamuskeet in present-day Hyde County. In 1701 English colonists described the tribe as containing roughly 100 members. \n\nIn 1711 they participated in the Tuscarora War against the colonists. By 1715, the remaining members of the Coree, who lived to the south, had been merged into the Machapunga and lived together with them in Mattamuskeet. \n\nJohn Squires was the Chief of the Tribe. His mother was Ethelia, married to an Englishman named Jonathan Squires. Ethelia's father was the Chief of the Nanticoke in Dorchester County Maryland, but her mother was Machapunga, thus having made John the Chief of the Machapunga. John owned and operated a Trading Post, with another Indian named Long Tom off of the Old Indian Trail on the Chesapeake Bay. They were summoned many times by the English Colonists to interpret for them, and helped settle many indifferences between the Colonists and the Indians. John's parents, Jonathan and Ethelia continued to reside on the Nanticoke Nation Land in Dorchester County Maryland. John Squires was one of the most well documented Indians of the Machapunga Tribe. He has many Squire descendants of both Nanticoke, and Machapunga blood.\n\nBecause of colonial concerns about slavery and racial control, officials organized society in a binary way, classifying people as white and colored (the latter category essentially covered all non-whites). Living conditions and arrangements were often more fluid than the record keeping. When the United States starting keeping census records in 1790, it had no category for Indian and did not establish a separate one until late in the 19th century. Those not living on reservations were included among \"Free blacks,\" \"Other free,\" or \"Mulatto\", which were different categories used to classify free non-whites. Before that time, the surviving Native Americans in the states were generally classified as mulatto, free people of color or black, if of identifiably African descent. In Maryland, Catholic churches kept parish records that continued to indicate families and individuals who identified as Indian, regardless of whether they were of mixed race, but the states did not.\n\nDescendants of the Machapunga tribe reside in the Inner Banks of eastern North Carolina. Some of the Machapunga descendants traditionally had the surnames Squires, Mackey, sometimes spelled Mackee, Mackie or Macky. Other known surnames among the people were Barber, Chance, Clark, Collins, Elks, Morris, and King. Survivors intermarried with other ethnic peoples, and their children and grandchildren carry all their ancestry. \n\nEthnographers and anthropologists such as Speck studied the peoples of the Southeast in the early 20th century, trying to determine if Native American cultures had survived. Speck found little evidence of the Machapunga and other Algonquian cultures. He did note that people had continued fishing with their traditional nets, and the women wove baskets according to traditional skills and styles.\n\n"}

{"id": "1115120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115120", "title": "Max Linder", "text": "Max Linder\n\nGabriel-Maximilien Leuvielle (16 December 18831 November 1925), better known by the stage name Max Linder (), was a French actor, director, screenwriter, producer and comedian of the silent film era. His onscreen persona \"Max\" was one of the first recognizable recurring characters in film. He has also been cited as the \"first international movie star.\"\n\nBorn in Cavernes, France to Catholic parents, Linder grew up with a passion for the theatre and enrolled in the Conservatoire Bordeaux in 1899. He soon received awards for his performances and continued to pursue a career in the legitimate theatre. He became a contract player with the Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by Molière, Pierre Corneille and Alfred de Musset.\n\nFrom the summer of 1905, Linder appeared in short comedy films for Pathé, at first usually in supporting roles. His first major film role was in the Georges Méliès-like fantasy film \"The Legend of Punching\". During the following years, Linder made several hundred short films portraying \"Max\", a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. Starting with \"The Skater's Debut\" in 1907, the character became one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies. By 1911, Linder was co-directing his own films (with René LePrince) as well as writing the scripts.\n\nLinder enlisted at the outbreak of the First World War, and worked at first as a dispatch driver and entertainer. During his service, he was injured several times, and the experiences reportedly had a devastating effect on him both physically and mentally. It was during this time he suffered his first outbreak of chronic depression.\n\nLinder was born Gabriel-Maximilien Leuvielle near Saint-Loubès, Gironde. His parents were wealthy vineyard owners and expected Linder to take over the family business; his older brother Maurice (born 28 June 1881) had become a celebrated national rugby player. But Linder grew up with a passion for the theatre and was enthralled by the traveling theater and circus performances that occasionally visited his town. He later wrote that \"nothing was more distasteful to me than the thought of a life among the grapes.\"\n\nIn 1899, Linder enrolled in the Conservatoire de Bordeaux and quickly won awards for first prize in comedy and second prize in tragedy. He continued to pursue a career in the theater and became a contract player with the Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by Molière, Pierre Corneille and Alfred de Musset. At the same time that he was performing in serious dramatic theater, he became friends with Charles le Bargy of the Comédie-Française. Le Bargy encouraged Linder to audition for the Conservatoire de Paris in 1904. Linder was rejected and began appearing in less prestigious theaters such as the Olympia Theater and the Théâtre de l'Ambigu.\n\nBy 1905, he had adopted his stage name of Max Linder and used it in several theatrical performances. Also during this period, Linder applied for work at Pathé Frères in Vincennes at the suggestion of film director Louis Gasnier and began appearing in small bit parts, mostly in slapstick comedies. Linder continued to appear on the stage for the next two years and was not a significant film star at first. However, an often-told legend about the origins of Linder's film career is that French film producer Charles Pathé personally saw Linder on the stage and wrote him a note that read \"In your eyes lies a fortune. Come and act in front of my cameras, and I will help make it.\"\n\nFrom 1905 to 1907, Linder appeared in dozens of short comedy films for Pathé, usually in a supporting role. His first noticeably larger film role was in \"The Young Man's first outing\" in 1905. He also appeared in Georges Méliès-like fantasy films such as \"Serpentine Dances\" and \"The Legend of Punching\", his first leading role. His rise to stardom commenced in 1907 when Pathé's slapstick star René Gréhan left the company to join Éclair. Gréhan's screen character was Gontran, whose persona included high-society clothing and a dandy-ish demeanor. Linder was chosen to take over the characterization for Pathé, and the style of dress and personality of Gréhan's character became his trademark. Film critic David Robinson described Linder's screen persona as \"no grotesque: he was young, handsome, debonair, immaculate...in silk hat, jock coat, cravat, spats, patent shoes, and swagger cane.\" Linder made more than one hundred short films portraying \"Max\", a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. With this character, he had created one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies.\n\nLinder's first appearance as \"Max\" was in \"The Skater's Debut\" in 1907. Lake Daumesnil in Paris had frozen over and director Louis Gasnier filmed Linder in his new attire, with Linder improvising the rest. In the film, \"Max\" falls about and does a rendition of \"the windmill routine\" by spinning his cane around, predating Charlie Chaplin's version in \"The Rink\" by nine years. Pathé was unimpressed with the film and re-shot parts of it, and it was not popular with audiences when released. Soon afterwards, Gasnier left Pathé and moved to Italy, leaving Linder without a supporter at Pathé; he made few films in 1908. His luck began to change when Pathé's top comedy star, André Deed, left to work with the Italian film company Itala, leaving Linder as the company's leading comedic actor. Later in 1909, Gasnier returned from Italy and immediately began working with Linder again. The team made several shorts in 1909 with Linder in various roles, such as a blind elderly man and a coquettish young woman. But they soon discovered that the character of \"Max\" was the most popular with audiences and stuck with him from then on. Among the popular \"Max\" films made by Linder and Grasnier in 1909 are \"A Young Lady Killer\" and \"The Cure for Cowardice\"\n\nBy 1910, Linder had proved himself to Pathé and was quickly becoming one of the most popular film actors in the world. When Gasnier was sent to the United States later that year to oversee Pathé's productions there, Lucien Nonguet took over as Linder's director. Together they made such films as \"Max takes a bath\" and the autobiographical \"Max Linder's Film Debut\", which fictitiously recreates the legend of Linder's early film career and includes Charles Pathé as himself.\n\nBy the end of the year, Linder had become the most popular film actor in the world. Although actress Florence Lawrence is often referred to as \"The First Movie Star\" in the United States, Linder appears to be the very first worldwide movie star with a major following. In Russia, he was voted the most popular film actor, ahead of Asta Nielsen. He also had a Russian impersonator, Zozlov, and a devoted fan in Czar Nicholas II. Another professed fan was British playwright George Bernard Shaw. The first feature film ever made in Bulgaria was a remake of one of Linder's earlier movies. He was offered $12,000 to spend a month in Berlin making public appearances with his film screenings, but had to decline for health reasons. In France, a Max Linder movie theater had opened in Paris.\n\nAt the height of his fame, Linder ended 1910 with a serious illness. He was forced to stop making films when appendicitis left him bedridden, and some newspapers reported that he had died. He eventually recovered the following spring and began making films again in May 1911.\n\nIn 1911, Linder returned to filmmaking and began co-directing his own films (with René LePrince) as well as writing the scripts. By 1912, he was the solo director of his films. Gaining complete control over his own films brought positive results both critically and commercially; the films Linder made during this period are generally considered to be his best. \"Max, Victim of Quinine\" is considered by film critic Jean Mitry to be \"his masterpiece.\" In the film, an intoxicated \"Max\" gets into numerous fights with such dignitaries as the Minister of War, an ambassador and the police commissioner, all of whom challenge him to a duel and present him with their business cards. Eventually \"Max\" is apprehended by the police, who attempt to return him to his residence, but end up mistakenly taking him to the homes of the various men whom he had previously fought with.\n\nThe universality of silent films brought Linder fame and fortune throughout Europe, making him the highest paid entertainer of the day, with a salary increase of 150,000 francs (the average monthly salary in France was 100 francs at the time). He began touring Europe with his films from 1911 to 1912, including Spain, where he entertained thousands of fans at the Barcelona railway station, Austria, and Russia, where he was accompanied on piano by a young Dimitri Tiomkin. In 1912 after the tour, Linder demanded and received a salary of one million francs a year, and Charles Pathé used the huge sum to generate publicity, with an ad reading \"We understand that the shackles which bind Max Linder have attained the value of one million francs a year...the imagination boggles at such a figure!\" This set a precedent in the entertainment industry for actors' salaries that would become a staple of the Hollywood system, but privately Pathé nicknamed Linder \"The Napoleon of the Cinema\".\n\nThe high point of Linder's career was from 1912 to 1914. His films were made with increased skill and \"Max\" was at his funniest. He made such films as \"Max Virtuoso\", \"Max Does Not Speak English\", \"Max and His Dog\", \"Max's Hat\" and \"Max and the Jealous Husband\". His ensemble of actors included Stacia de Napierkowska, Jane Renouardt, Gaby Morlay and occasional performances from the young actors Abel Gance and Maurice Chevalier. Linder had given Chevalier his start in movies, but the silent medium did not suit Chevalier, who stuck to the stage until the all-singing all-dancing features came in, many years later.\n\nThe outbreak of World War I brought a temporary end to Linder's film career in 1914, but not before he made the short patriotic film \"The Second of August\" that year. Linder attempted to enlist in the French army, but was physically unfit for combat duty. Instead he worked as a dispatch driver between Paris and the front lines. Many conflicting stories about the reasons behind his dismissal from the army exist, including that he was shot through the lung, and seriously wounded. Initially, it was reported by one newspaper that he had been killed; Linder actually phoned the offending publishers, leading them to run the headline \"Max Linder Not Killed\". However, others have asserted that he became infected with pneumonia after hiding from a German patrol in icy water for several hours. After being dismissed from his duties, Linder spent the remainder of the war entertaining the troops and making films. It was also during this period that Linder suffered his first serious bout with chronic depression.\n\nCorrection: Max Linder couldn't have been \"the most popular film actor in the world\" by the end of 1910--the first screen actors weren't known by name in America until the middle of the year. Even at the height of his popularity in the US, Linder received just 1092 in Motion Picture Story's 1912 Popular Player Contest, to reach 79th place--three ahead of Jean the Vitagraph Dog. Maurice Costello, the first true international star, received 430,816 votes to win the contest hands down. By 1913, he was famous the world over. In 1915, a British film magazine named him the most popular foreign player, while Linder came in 17th. (Richard DeCordova, Picture Personalities: The Emergence of the Star System in America (Chicago, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001),74; Motion Picture Story, June 1912, 146; Pictures and the Picturegoer, November 6, 1915, 112.\n\nIn 1916, Linder was approached by American film producer George K. Spoor, the president of the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, to make twelve short films for him in the US at a salary of $5,000 a week. Earlier that year, Charlie Chaplin, then the most popular comedian in the world, had left Essanay for more money and independence at Mutual Film and Spoor wanted to replace Chaplin with Max Linder, whose pantomime skills were arguably equally accomplished. Linder was offered a new contract from Charles Pathé, but accepted Spoor's offer and moved to the United States to work for Essanay later that year. Unfortunately his first few American-made \"Max\" films were unpopular both critically and financially. The first two, \"Max Comes Across\" and \"Max Wants a Divorce\" were complete failures, but the third film, \"Max and his Taxi\" was moderately successful. The financially troubled studio may have been counting on Linder to restore its flagging fortunes and cancelled production of the remaining films on Linder's contract. \"Max and his Taxi\" had been shot in Hollywood and while there Linder had developed a close friendship with Charlie Chaplin. They would often attend events such as boxing matches or car races together, and according to writer Jack Spears, \"while working on a picture Linder would go next door to Chaplin's home and discuss the day's shooting. The two often sat until dawn, developing and refining the gags. Chaplin's suggestions were invaluable, Linder said.\"\n\nLinder returned to France in 1917 and opened a movie theater, the Ciné Max Linder. However, due to his depression and anxiety about the still ongoing war, he was unable to continue making films on a regular basis, and was often quoted by journalists about the horrors of the front lines. After the Armistice in 1918, Linder was able to regain his enthusiasm and agreed to make a film with director Raymond Bernard, the feature length \"The Little Café\" in 1919. In the film, Linder plays a waiter who suddenly becomes a millionaire, but simultaneously is tricked into a twenty-year contract to be a waiter by the cafe owner. The film made over a million francs in Europe and briefly revived his career, but was financially unsuccessful in the US.\n\nFour years after failing to become a major star in the US, Linder made another attempt at filmmaking in Hollywood and formed his own production company there in 1921. His first film back in the US was \"Seven Years Bad Luck\", considered by some to be his best film. The film contains one of the earliest (though not the first) examples on film of the \"human mirror\" gag best known in the scene between Groucho and Harpo Marx in \"Duck Soup\" twelve years later. Linder next made \"Be My Wife\" later that year, but again neither films were able to find a major audience in the US.\n\nLinder then decided to dispense of the \"Max\" character and try something different for his third (and final) attempt: \"The Three Must-Get-Theres\" in 1922. The film is a satire of swashbuckling films made by Douglas Fairbanks and is loosely based on the plot of Alexander Dumas' \"The Three Musketeers\". The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin, but again failed at the box office. At the films premiere, Linder had said to director Robert Florey \"You see, Bob, I sense that I'm no longer funny; I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character ... The public is mildly amused by my situations, but this evening where were the explosions of laughter that we hear when Charlie's on the screen?...Make people laugh, its easy to say make people laugh, but I don't feel funny anymore.\"\n\nWith his depression making it difficult for him to work, Linder returned to France in 1922 and shortly afterwards made a semi-serious film: \"Au Secours!\" (\"Help!\") for director Abel Gance. The film is essentially a horror film set in a haunted house, with occasional moments of comedy by Linder. The film was released in England in 1924 and was critically praised, however the legal copyright of the film prevented it from being released in France or the US for several years. Linder's last film was \"The King of the Circus\" directed by Édouard-Émile Violet (with pre-production collaboration from Jacques Feyder) and filmed in Vienna in 1925. In the film, \"Max\" joins a circus in order to be closer to the woman that he loves. The film includes such gags as a hungover \"Max\" waking up in a department store and the film's plot is similar to the Charlie Chaplin film \"The Circus\" (1928). In late 1925, Linder was working on pre-production for his next film \"Barkas le fol\", which would never be made.\n\nAs a consequence of his war service, Linder suffered from continuing health problems, including bouts of severe depression. In 1923, he married eighteen-year-old Hélène \"Jean\" Peters, who came from a wealthy family and with whom he had a daughter, Maud (born 27 July 1924), also known as \"Josette\". \n\nLinder and his wife may have made a suicide pact. In February 1924, they were both found unconscious at a hotel in Vienna, Austria, though this was explained as an accidental overdose of \"sleeping powder.\" The incident was covered up by the physician reporting it as an accidental overdose of barbiturates. In late October 1925, Max and Hélène reportedly attended a Paris screening of \"Quo Vadis\" (in which the main characters, as a reporter put it, \"bleed themselves to death\"), and died on October 31 in a similar manner. They drank Veronal, injected morphine and slashed their wrists. \n\nThere is still some question, however, as to whether the deaths were really a result of a suicide pact, or whether Max murdered his much-younger wife or pressured her into killing herself. On Nov. 2, 1925, The New York Times reported that Hélène Linder had told her mother by letter that, \"He will kill me.\" The article also claims that \"no one believes she herself opened her veins.\" Critic Vincent Canby acknowledged in 1988 that \"Linder died with his young wife in what has sometimes been described as a suicide pact, and sometimes as a murder-suicide.\" In addition, Maud Linder reported in her memoir that the head of the workmen at Linder's house in Neuilly overheard Max tell a friend, probably Armand Massard, that he planned to kill his wife along with himself, as he could not bear the thought of her belonging to another after he was gone. \n\nLinder was buried at the Catholique cimetière de Saint-Loubès. His wife is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\n\nUpon receiving the news of Linder's death, Chaplin is reported to have closed his studio for one day out of respect. \n\nIn the ensuing years, Linder was relegated to little more than a footnote in film history until 1963 when a Max Linder compilation film titled \"Laugh with Max Linder\" premiered at the Venice Film Festival and was theatrically released. The film was a compilation of Linder's last three films made in Hollywood and its release was supervised by his daughter, Maud Linder. \n\nIn 1983, Maud Linder made a documentary film, \"The Man in the Silk Hat\", about Linder's life and career. It was screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. In 1992, Maud Linder published a book about Linder in France, \"Max Linder was my father\" and in 2008 she received the Prix Henri Langlois for her work to promote her father's legacy. In his honor, \"Lycée Max Linder\", a public school in the city of Libourne in the Gironde département near his birthplace was given his name in 1981.\n\nLinder's influence on film comedy and particularly on slapstick films is that the genre shifted from the \"knockabout\" comedies made by such people as Mack Sennett and André Deed to a more subtle, refined and character driven medium that would later be dominated by Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and others. Linder's influence on Chaplin is apparent both from Chaplin sometimes borrowing gags or entire plot-lines from Linder's films, as well as from a famous signed photo that Chaplin sent Linder which read: \"To Max, the Professor, from his disciple, Charlie Chaplin.\" Mack Sennett and King Vidor also singled out Linder as a great influence on their directing careers. His high society characterizations as \"Max\" also influenced such actors as Adolphe Menjou and Raymond Griffith.\n\nIn his heyday, Linder had two major rivals in France: Léonce Perret and Charles Prince. Perrett later became a successful director, but his early career included a series of \"Léonce\" slapstick shorts that were popular but nowhere near the stature of Linder's films. Charles Prince, on the other hand, was gaining popularity during his career and was nearly equal to Linder by the beginning of World War I. Prince's screen persona was \"Rigadin\", who like \"Max\" was a bumbling bourgeois socialite who always got into trouble. Both Linder and Prince were employed by Pathé in the early 1910s and they often used the same story lines, sets and directors. Years after both comedians' careers were long over, Linder has received several revivals in interest while Charles Prince remains mostly forgotten.\n\nLinder is referenced in Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" where the owner of a cinema in Nazi occupied Paris in 1944, Shosanna Dreyfus, says that she will be having a Max Linder festival. The relative merits of Linder and Chaplin are then discussed by the German soldier, Frederick Zoller, who argues that Linder is superior to Chaplin while also admitting that Linder never made anything as good as \"The Kid\".\n\n\n"}

He was one of the founding members and early chiefs of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He was killed in a 1981 bombing in Tehran.\n\nBorn in Najafabad in 1944, Montazeri was the oldest son of Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri. He had two brothers and two sisters.\n\nMontazeri was a low-ranking and radical cleric. He began opposition activities to the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the June 1963 events that led to the exile of Khomeini. His father and he were both arrested by the Shah's security forces in March 1966. In prison Mohammad was tortured and released in 1968. He left Iran for Pakistan. Then he settled in Najaf, Iraq, in 1971 and stayed there until 1975. Next he lived in Afghanistan and in other cities of Iraq.\n\nHe headed an armed group that was based in Syria and Lebanon and fought against Israeli forces. The group was founded by Montazeri and Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur with the aim of assisting liberation movements in Muslim countries.\n\nMontazeri was trained in Fatah camps in Lebanon. In addition, he fought with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and other Palestinian and Shiite armed groups in the country. Montazeri was one of the three Iranian key officials along with Mostafa Chamran and Mohtashamipur who strengthened Iran's commitment to Lebanon. He was called Abu Ahmad by Lebanese people. Montazeri also travelled to Europe during this period.\n\nIn 1978 he occupied the Mehrabad airport of Tehran with his 200 armed followers and demanded to go to Libya to search for Musa Al Sadr, a Lebanese Shia cleric who disappeared in Libya in August 1978. He visited Ayatollah Khomeini when the latter was in exile in Paris. Before the 1979 Iranian revolution he was one of the people who promoted the idea of founding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nDuring the revolutionary process, he was called \"Ayatollah Ringo\" and \"Red Sheikh\". In order to export Islamic revolution to other countries he and Mehdi Hashemi founded one of the earliest groups, the Revolutionary Organization of the Masses of the Islamic Republic or Satja, in the spring of 1979. In December 1979, he organized a campaign to support and join the Palestinian militants. fighting in the Lebanese civil war. His activities in the Satja caused conflicts with the government and he was forced to disband it.\n\nThen he and Hashemi joined the Guards. Montazeri headed a faction of the Guards in Tehran that functioned as a strong arm of the Supreme Leader Khomeini. It was called Freedom Movements Unit. In 1981 this faction was transformed into the office of liberation movements (OLM) which was firstly led by him and after his death, by Hashemi. An account with the name liberation movements was opened in the Melli Bank to get financial support from Iranians. The OLM put into practice the Iranian support for the Shi‘a movements in Iraq and the Gulf as well as those in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Afghanistan.\n\nAt the founding and institutionalization phase of the Guards Montazeri became a member of the Revolutionary Guards Leadership Council in 1979 which was formed by the Revolutionary Council to oversee the future tasks of the Guard. He publicly declared in 1980 that the IRGC personnel \"were awaiting deployment from Damascus.\"\n\nMontazeri joined and led the Muslim People's Republic Party and became a member of the first Majlis in March 1980. On the other hand, his party was disbanded after its members were either arrested or executed. In addition, Montazeri served at the supreme defense council and was the prayer leader in Tehran until his death.\n\nMontazeri was one of the most radical followers of Ayatollah Khomeini. Before the Iranian revolution he was close ally of Moammar Qaddafi and advocated strong ties with Libya. And, he did not support the approach of the Amal movement and Musa Al Sadr, because it was non-revolutionary. Montazeri was also a fierce critic of the interim government led by Mahdi Bazargan due to the same reason.\n\nBoth Montazeri and his father actively encouraged the rebellion of Shia Muslims against the governments in the Muslim countries and also, strongly argued for the export of the Islamic regime to other countries, often called \"Islamic Internationale\". The latter goal was mostly achieved through the OLM, and it is one of two pillars of ideology guided the revolution along with the propagation of Islam. In addition, he argued that all Muslims could enter Islamic states without passport or visas.\n\nMontazeri also supported for the development of links with Shia Muslims in Lebanon. He tried to make Iran a key player in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Just three days before his death, he argued for the execution of the ousted prime minister Abolhassan Bani Sadr's followers.\n\nAt the initial phase of the Iranian revolution the activities of the Montazeri's group, Satja, led to tensions between Montazeri and both the Guards's leadership and the provisional government. His father, Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, publicly reprimanded him and stated that Mohammad had poor mental health because he had been tortured by the former Shah's secret police. Eventually, elder Montazeri disassociated himself from his son’s activities.\n\nMohammad Montazeri was part of the Libya-friendly group in the court of Khomeini and there was a feud between his group and the faction, called \"Syrian mafia\", led by Sadegh Ghotbzadeh. Ghotbzadeh's faction was called previously the Liberation Movement of Iran (LMI), and Mostafa Chamran was also part of it. In addition, Montazeri had serious disagreements with Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, cofounder of the Islamic Republican Party.\n\nMontazeri was killed in a bombing at the central headquarters of the then ruling party, Islamic Republican Party, in Tehran on 28 June 1981. The Islamic Republic of Iran suspected various organizations and individuals, including SAVAK, the Iraqi regime, the People's Mujahedin of Iran, the United States, royalist army officers, and \"internal mercenaries\". It also executed 4 Iraqi agents and Mehdi Tafari for the incident. The death toll in the attack was 73, including Behesti, cabinet ministers and the members of the Majlis. A state funeral was held for the victims on 30 June and a week of mourning was proclaimed. Montazeri was buried in the Fatima Masumeh Shrine in Qom where his father would also be buried on 21 December 2009.\n\nA street in Qom was named after him, Martyr Mohammad Montazeri boulevard.\n"}

As a young man, he started to seek solutions for his health problems and was influenced by natural healing writers of the 20th century such as Vincent Priessnitz, Louis Kuhne, Harry Benjamin, Arnold Ehret, Dugald Semple, George R. Clements, Walter Siegmeister, Essie Honiball and Johnny Lovewisdom. He also studied new age, occult, esoteric, yogic, spiritual and metaphysical writings from the East. Krok migrated to California to develop his work and writings, dedicating his life to the quest for knowledge about health, vitality and higher consciousness. A regular marathon runner, Krok died from cancer of the leg in 2005, blaming \"his problem on his terrible diet in his youth and on cooked food temptations from family\".\n\nBeliefs\n\nIn the 1950s, a popular South African newspaper featured a story about Krok’s belief that fruit was the ideal food for humankind. In the 1990s and 2000s, David Klein Ph.D., publisher of Living Nutrition, chronicled Krok's famous sayings including \"Man will always get colds if he persists in eating large quantities of mucous forming foods in the form of starch, dairy products and animal fats.\" and \"Health is the balance between assimilation and elimination.” in the magazine. Central to Krok's thinking was that mucusless foods held the key to good health. In the article, \"A Yogic Perspective\" he describes how \"To heal and avoid illness, one must alkalinize the body through a diet of predominately raw fruits and vegetables.\"\n\nWritings\n\nKrok wrote books on detoxification, internal purification, natural living, self-healing, fruitarianism, fasting, living foods, raw nutrition, physical culture, hatha yoga, meditation, deep breathing, higher consciousness, radiant energy, life extension and vitalism. As well as being an author, Krok published several books by other authors including Johanna Brandt, Otto Abramowski and Theos Bernard, through Essence of Health Publishers.\n\nGolden Path\n\nKrok's book \"Golden Path To Rejuvenation\" described how a non-toxic diet and the osmotic pressure of rainwater could detoxify and purify the membranes and tissues of the body. Krok believed that internal purification, was the direct and most effective way for a longer and youthful life. He described how not everything humans eat is used by the body, showing how accumulated wastes and toxins caused by an unnatural diet and other substances, result in illness and premature ageing. His internal purification programme was designed to help increase longevity and remain youthful. He believed internal cleansing in conjunction with plant foods was the 'golden path'. The book also explained the \"yogic vomit\" technique, a central part of the detoxification regime he endorsed.\n\nLegacy\n\nKrok was one of a series of 20th-century writers who wrote about fruitarianism, raw nutrition, fasting, detoxification, yoga and higher consciousness. His contemporaries included Brian Clement Ph.D, Dr. Douglas N. Graham, Viktoras Kulvinskas and Robert Gray. Authors who have endorsed Krok's writings in their books include John McCabe, Joe Alexander, Gary Null, Benito De Donno and David Wolfe.\n\nMorris Krok advocated a fruitarian diet in his writings as the optimal diet and described how at stages during his life, he lived \"only on fruits\". It is claimed that he later advised against a diet of \"only fruit\" however, it was subsequently reported that Krok's diet consisted of \"just fruit\".\n\nBooks and booklets written by Morris Krok, many published through Essence Of Health Publishers:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24189620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24189620", "title": "Puck (Glee)", "text": "Puck (Glee)\n\nNoah \"Puck\" Puckerman is a fictional character from the Fox musical comedy-drama series \"Glee\". The character was portrayed by actor Mark Salling, and appeared in \"Glee\" from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009 to the series finale, broadcast on March 20, 2015. Puck was developed by \"Glee\" creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. He is Finn's best friend and football teammate, who initially disapproves of Finn joining the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set, but he eventually joins it himself. In 2010, Salling was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Breakout Star Male for his work as Puck, and in 2011 for the Choice TV: Scene Stealer Male category.\n\nPuck was played by Mark Salling. He was also portrayed as a preschooler by Matthew Lepper in the episode \"The Substitute\". Salling had sent 100 packets to agents and managers, and \"one called me and submitted me for Glee that day in her office.\" He had five auditions for \"Glee\" before being cast as Puck.\n\nSalling found it challenging to make the character \"more than two-dimensional so he can be likable at the same time\", which necessitated \"find[ing] the balance between arrogance and cocky and sensible and likable\". He recalled that \"in the breakdown for the show, when they were describing his character in the very beginning, it's like Puck: a man-child.\" Salling explained that Puck has \"stars in his eyes, he's hoping to get out of this small town.\" Salling gained before filming the pilot episode in order to better embody his football playing character. He then lost for a scene in the third episode that required him to be toned, which he described as \"an extreme experience\".\n\nPuck's main basis for relationships at the beginning is sexual rather than romantic. He has sexual encounters with his female pool-cleaning clients and fellow students, including a recurrent relationship with cheerleader Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) that seems to be casual, though Santana confronts both Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) when Puck starts pursuing them in the first and second seasons respectively. He falls in love with Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after he takes her virginity and impregnates her despite the fact that she's dating his best friend Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) at the time, but he can't give up flirting with and seducing others even when Quinn contemplates raising the baby-to-be with him as he wants rather than giving it up for adoption, since she refuses to have sex with him again. The brief pairing of Puck with Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) in the episode \"Mash-Up\", spurred by his mother urging him to find a Jewish girlfriend, dissolves because he wants Quinn and she wants Finn. Series creator Ryan Murphy was surprised by the positive fan response to their pairing, which he described as \"strange and bizarre\", explaining that he had believed fans would prefer Rachel to be with Finn. As a result of the response, Murphy planned to revisit their romance later in the season, though nothing much came of it.\n\nIn the second season, Puck recruits Lauren to join the glee club when the club needs a twelfth member in order to participate in the Sectionals competition. Within a couple of months, he has fallen in love with her, but she doesn't succumb to his blandishments, and he's forced to woo her over a long period of time, starting as friends. He supports her in her first solo for glee club and runs her campaign for prom queen. They are still a couple at the end of the school year. In the fourth episode of the third season, Puck and the adoptive mother of his child Shelby Corcoran kiss. He ends the series dating Quinn.\n\nPuck is introduced as a football player and bully at William McKinley High School; he is frequently seen throwing fellow students into dumpsters, or tossing slushies in their faces. It is later revealed that he is Jewish. He is the best friend of Finn, the quarterback, and has a summer pool-cleaning business that leads to sexual encounters with his adult female clients. Despite that, he has sex with fellow students, including in an on-again, off-again relationship with Santana Lopez, a cheerleader, which does not completely end forever until the middle of the second season. Puck initially acts homophobic and mocks Finn for joining the school glee club, New Directions, but later becomes a part of glee club director Will Schuester's (Matthew Morrison) all-male a cappella group, the Acafellas, hoping to impress the mothers at a performance for the school's PTA meeting. He subsequently joins New Directions along with two other members of the football team. When Finn's girlfriend Quinn is impregnated and tells Finn the baby is his, Puck realizes that he is the actual father, and offers to support Quinn. She rejects his proposal, calling him a \"Lima loser\". Puck begins dating Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), the glee club lead vocalist, after his mother urges him to find a Jewish girlfriend; Rachel is initially resistant, but agrees after Puck sings \"Sweet Caroline\" for her in front of the glee club. However, Rachel later breaks up with him after a brief romance.\n\nWhen the glee club holds a bake sale to pay for a wheelchair-accessible bus so Artie (Kevin McHale) can ride with the club to Sectionals competition, it only succeeds because Puck makes a special, popular cupcake recipe—he secretly adds pot, which gives everyone the munchies. He offers financials to Quinn to show he will be a good father and provider; she figures out that it’s the money from the bake sale, and refuses to accept it, though she expresses her gratitude and apologizes for abusing him verbally. Quinn reconsiders her plan to have the baby adopted and gives Puck a chance to prove himself by helping her to babysit Terri Schuester's (Jessalyn Gilsig) three nephews. Puck impresses her, but Quinn later learns that he was sexting Santana mostly. Puck claims he will be help her to parent their child, but he cannot remain in a committed relationship with Quinn if she refuses to have sex with him; Quinn returns to her original plan of giving the baby to Terri, who is faking a pregnancy to hold on to Will. Rachel begins to suspect that Puck is the father of Quinn's baby and tells Finn. Finn attacks Puck and confronts Quinn, who admits the truth. Puck again offers to be with Quinn, but she declines and tells him she wants to be alone, though she moves in with Puck's family since her parents had kicked her out and she can no longer stay at Finn’s house.\n\nIn the episode \"Laryngitis\", when Puck's mohawk is shaved off by his doctor, he finds the other McKinley students no longer respect him as a badass. He romances fellow glee club member Mercedes, once a popular cheerleader, to restore his status. His plan is successful, but he and Mercedes ultimately have nothing in common, and split when she quits cheerleading and he returns to his bullying ways. In the first-season finale, \"Journey to Regionals\", Quinn goes into labour immediately after the club performs at the Regionals competition, and Puck is in the delivery room when Quinn give birth to a baby girl, whom Puck names Beth. When Puck and Quinn visit their baby in the hospital nursery, Puck tells Quinn that he loves her. Beth is adopted by Rachel's birth mother Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, the show choir that defeated New Directions at Regionals.\n\nIn the season opener, \"Audition\", Puck is interviewed by blogger Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) and reveals that he had a vasectomy over the summer, saying it was the only responsible thing to do. Soon after the school year begins, Puck is arrested and sent to a juvenile detention center for driving his mother's car through a convenience store window and driving off with the ATM. He returns in \"Never Been Kissed\", but he is now on probation and helps Artie out in an attempt to satisfy his community service, although this is only initially because Puck claimed he was \"helping a crip\" and they misunderstood him. Though he acts tougher than ever to his classmates, Puck eventually confesses to Artie that he was terrified in juvie, and the two come to the agreement that Artie will tutor Puck, who has to pick up garbage to fulfill his community service requirements. In \"Furt\", Puck, Artie, Mike Chang and Sam Evans confront Dave Karofsky in the boys locker room to get him to stop bullying Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer). Because he was still on probation, Puck reluctantly had to watch the beat down between Sam and Karofsky, but despite not being allowed to fight and feeling helpless about it, he showed great restraint and was still praised for standing up for Kurt. \"Special Education\", Puck is asked by Will to find a new glee club member to replace Kurt, who has left McKinley and New Directions. He tries to recruit from the football team, but they lock him in a port-a-potty; he is rescued the next day by Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who becomes the club's new twelfth member. Puck gets intimate with Rachel at her instigation, but leaves abruptly, realizing that he doesn't want to betray Finn for a second time, though Finn dumps Rachel when she confesses to him about it. Puck and Finn finally settle their differences in \"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\", and they work together to help the football team win its first-ever championship. \n\nIn the episode \"Silly Love Songs\", Puck unexpectedly falls for Lauren, and performs the song \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" by Queen, which expresses his love of Lauren's bigger body type, but Lauren is offended by the song. Santana, unhappy with being deserted by Puck, slaps Lauren in front of him to warn her away, and Lauren tosses her around like she was nothing, leaving her dazed. Puck immediately begs Lauren to go out with him. She ultimately agrees to go on a pre-Valentine's date with him, but stands him up. Puck clumsily tells Lauren he likes her, not because of her looks but because of her \"badass-ness\"; Lauren says she is not looking for something casual. They go out on Valentine's Day \"as friends\", though Puck is clearly hoping for more in the future. In the episode \"Sexy\", Lauren tells Puck she's decided to make a sex tape to help her become famous, to his delight, but their plans are dashed when substitute sex education teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) informs them that as both are underage it would be considered child pornography. As part of a class assignment in the episode \"Original Song\", Puck writes and sings a song for Lauren—\"Big Ass Heart\"—that she likes. In \"Born This Way\", Puck discovers that Lauren had been a child beauty queen; he tells her he will run a campaign for her to become that year’s prom queen, and be her king. After candidate Quinn insults Lauren’s candidacy, Puck helps Lauren dig up dirt on Quinn, but the tactic backfires. Neither Puck nor Lauren win the race for prom queen and king, but they remain a couple; they fly with the rest of New Directions to the nationals competition in New York City, where the glee club comes in twelfth out of fifty teams.\n\nLauren breaks up with Puck at the beginning of school year and drops out of glee club, claiming that it is hurting her reputation. Shelby Corcoran, who adopted baby Beth, gets a teaching job at McKinley, and invites Puck and Quinn to be a part of Beth's life, provided they both become more responsible. Puck does so, and Shelby allows him to see Beth. Quinn decides she wants to regain custody of Beth, but Puck is torn, and tells Shelby of Quinn's plans. He spends increasing amounts of time with Beth, but then falls in love with Shelby. She sleeps with him once, though she tells him afterward she has made a mistake, to his disgust, and subsequently resigns from McKinley. One day his father visits him at work asking him for money for rent. This visit makes Puck fear that he might one day be like his father and visit Beth at work and ask her for money. He decides to be a father that Beth would be proud of and tries to do better in school and graduate with his class. After he fails his history final and discovers that he is not graduating he decides to not care about grades and flunk out. In the episode \"Props\", he gets into a fight with Rick \"The Stick\" Nelson and pulls out a knife. Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) breaks up the fight and she informs Puck that he could get expelled from school for bringing the knife. He tells her that it's a prop knife that they used in their production of \"West Side Story\" and that he does not care since he is flunking out anyway. They have a heart to heart and the next day, she tells him that what he told her in their heart to heart the day before and it gave her the strength to leave her abusive husband. She told him that she owes him big time and that she talked to his history teacher and she agreed to let Puck retake the test. In the season finale, Puck studies with Quinn's help and then retakes his final exam. He passes with a C− and graduates from McKinley.\n\nIn the Season 4 premiere, it is revealed that Puck has a paternal half-brother named Jake (Jacob Artist) who he was not aware of, though the two are introduced to each other by Will in the following episode, \"Britney 2.0\", while Puck is briefly visiting Lima from his new home, Los Angeles. Jake later turns to Puck for advice over the phone on how to get Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) to date him, and Puck subsequently invites Jake to visit him in California over the Christmas holiday; the two get matching tattoos. Puck decides to return to Lima to live, and the two Puckermans arrange for their mothers to meet on Christmas Day where the two families bond. Puck later starts dating Kitty (Becca Tobin) in order to keep her away from Jake and spoiling his budding relationship with Marley, though Puck and she break up when he moves into Finn's dorm room at the college Finn has just started attending, even though Puck is not enrolled there. He appears less frequently this season, despite still being credited as a series regular.\n\nPuck makes infrequent guest appearances this season. Puck is devastated by Finn's death. In \"The Quarterback\", three weeks after the funeral, he steals a memorial tree planted for Finn and demands that Kurt, Finn's stepbrother, give him Finn's football jacket. Coach Beiste takes him to task for being drunk regularly after so many weeks, and the two mourn Finn together, but Beiste tells him he has to guide his own life without Finn's help, and asks him to replant the tree. When he later does so, he tells her that he intends to join the Air Force. In \"100\" Puck comes back to McKinley to say goodbye to the Glee Club before it is disbanded. He sees Quinn and the two of them have a conversation. He is about to tell Quinn that he still has feelings for her when her boyfriend, Biff McIntosh, shows up and shows Puck that he is rude. Puck sings Avril Lavigne's song Keep Holding On to her hoping that this would win her heart, but she turns him down stating that she loves Biff. Later, Quinn and Biff are having dinner at Breadsticks when Santana, Puck, Mike, and Artie show up. They sit with Quinn at her table and Biff reveals that he doesn't know any thing about Quinn's past. Her friends tell her about her behavior in the episode The Purple Piano Project. Quinn asks Biff to get something out of the car for her and after he leaves, she asks her friends not to mention anything to Biff since she is ashamed of her past. Puck asks her if she is ever going to tell him about their relationship and their daughter, Beth, and she says that she will eventually. This somewhat angers Puck as he tells her that she can't hide from the past and should embrace it. A few days later, Puck is hanging by the school buses when he hears Quinn and Biff fighting. Biff becomes angry with her at the fact that she kept so much from him, including having a baby with Puck. He calls her a slut, causing Puck to snap and punch him. Biff punches Puck back, causing Puck to punch him once more and then throws him into the dumpster. He then tells Quinn that she can help Biff out of the dumpster or join her real friends in the choir room. Later, Puck and Quinn are in the locker room looking at Finn's plaque. Quinn tells Puck that Biff went back to Yale by himself, and the relationship is over. Puck reveals that he still has feelings for her and wants to get back together. Quinn tells Puck that she isn't going to look back to her past, as she wants to look into her future. Puck leaves the locker room heartbroken and storms down the hallway when Quinn runs after him and kisses him, agreeing to give their relationship another chance.\n\nAs Puck, Salling features in many songs that have been released as singles available for digital download and are also featured in the show's soundtrack albums. He usually accompanies himself on the guitar for solo songs, including \"Sweet Caroline\", \"Only the Good Die Young\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", and the song ostensibly composed by Puck, \"Big Ass Heart\".\n\nNeil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" was his first solo number, in the episode \"Mash-Up\", and received favorable reviews from critics, and also from Diamond himself, who had initially been reluctant to license the number to the show. Following the episode's broadcast, Diamond posted his approval on the social networking website Twitter, writing: \"Hey, so who's this guy Puck singing 'Sweet Caroline' so good, so good, so good on #Glee? Loved it!!\" Raymund Flandez of \"The Wall Street Journal\" described Puck's voice on the song as \"earthly, sensual and full\", and \"Entertainment Weekly\" Michael Slezak said that Salling did \"more than a serviceable job\". \"Sweet Caroline\" was released as a single, available for digital download, and charted at number 34 in the US, 22 in Canada and 37 in Australia.\n\nSalling as Puck has received some positive reviews. Flandez said of Puck in the first-season episode \"Mash-Up\" that we finally saw him \"emerging from his bonehead-punk exterior\", and that he \"wows us with his sensitive, cool guy turn as a solo singer\" performing “Sweet Caroline”. In his review of the following episode, \"Wheels\", Todd VanDerWerff of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote, \"Mark Salling just seems to have a ridiculous amount of chemistry with all of the female cast members in the show, and it's fun to see him and Dianna Agron get in that food fight. Again, fun stuff, but a serious emotional core that keeps the show grounded.\"\n\nTelevision critics responded positively to the pairing of Puck and Lauren Zizes. Robert Canning of IGN said the \"absolute best part\" of the \"Silly Love Songs\" episode was Puck's \"unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes.\" Todd VanDerWerff of \"The A.V. Club\" commented: \"For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings.\" In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck \"a lot less assured\" than before, but \"Entertainment Weekly\" Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes \"as endearing as they are unrealistic\", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that \"the ice around [her] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo.\"\n\nPuck and Shelby's kiss in the \"Pot o' Gold\" episode was characterized as \"creepy\" and \"super awkward\" by \"AOLTV\" Crystal Bell, as either \"super creepy\" or \"romantic\" by BuddyTV's John Kubicek, and as \"groan-inducing\" in the \"You're actually going to go there?\" vein by Canning. Critics were polarized by Puck and Shelby's sexual encounter in the \"I Kissed a Girl\" episode. Kubicek declared that \"the dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber,\" MTV contributor Kevin Sullivan called it \"the most divisive plot line of the season\", and Bell asked, \"Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we please get more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?\"\n\nIn 2010, Salling was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Breakout Star Male for his performance as Puck. His \"Glee\" castmate, Kevin McHale (Artie), was also nominated in that category, but neither actor won the award. In 2011, he was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Scene Stealer Male along with \"Glee\" castmate Chris Colfer (Kurt); again, neither actor won.\n\n"}

She claimed to be a psychic and communicate with beings who created crop circles. She also acted as a trance medium and claimed to channel and materialize the spirit of a dead nine-year-old boy known as \"Russell\". Other spirits she said to materialize included the discredited medium Helen Duncan and Raymond the son of Oliver Lodge.\n\nGoold was accused as being a fraud by other spiritualists throughout her career. She became a popular medium in Britain known for her abilities to produce ectoplasm and materialize spirits, however, investigators discovered that the materialization figures were Goold herself and that she was a fraud. Goold refused infra-red cameras in her séances and would work only in dark conditions. \n\nIn 1984, Tony Cornell attended a series of séances with Goold. During a séance the spirit Russell materialized. However, Cornell felt the hands of Russell and described them as female-like with long nails; moreover, he was the same size as Goold when he was meant to be a boy and he smelt of Goold's perfume.\n\nThe other spirit who materialized Helen Duncan was the same size as Goold but was 224 pounds before she died. At the end of the séance when the lights were turned on Cornell observed that one of the shoes was different on Goold from the one before the séance and that one of her trouser legs was rolled up, indicating that she had changed clothing during the séance. Goold would also play music during her séances which provided cover for her to change clothes and when the music was turned off would pretend to be the spirits.\n"}

She is also a former MP serving as deputy in the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) for the Our Ukraine Party. Ruslana was the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in Ukraine in 2004-2005. She is recognized as the most successful Ukrainian female solo artist internationally and was included in the top 10 most influential women of 2013 by the Forbes magazine. The U.S. Secretary of State honored her with the International Women of Courage Award in March 2014. She has been named an honorary citizen of her hometown L'viv and was nominated to receive the title Hero of Ukraine.\n\nShe is a singer, songwriter, producer, musical conductor, multi-instrumentalist, dancer, voice actress and social activist. She writes, composes and produces her own songs and music videos. Since 28 December 1995 she has been married to Oleksandr Ksenofontov, a Ukrainian record producer. Together they have run the company \"Luxen Studio\" since 1993, producing radio and film trailers.\n\nRuslana was the first artist from the former Soviet Union to officially receive a platinum disc, her \"Dyki tantsi\" album selling more than 170,000 copies in the first 100 days after its release. This album is the best selling Ukrainian album to date, together with its English version, more than 500,000 copies being sold solely in Ukraine.\n\nShe won the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Wild Dances\" receiving 280 points, which at that time was a record of points. Following her victory, she rose to fame in Europe and became one of the biggest pop stars from the Eastern part of the continent. Her winning song \"Wild Dances\" dominated the European charts for 97 weeks peaking at number one in Belgium for 10 consecutive weeks. Her Eurovision winning song was included on the official compilation album called \"The Very Best of Eurovision\" celebrating the 60th anniversary of the contest.\n\nHer repertoire includes songs performed mainly in Ukrainian and English, but she also recorded cover versions in Spanish and Latin languages.\n\nRuslana was born on 24 May 1973 in Lviv, Ukraine to Ukrainian father Stepan Lyzhychko and Russian mother Nina Sapegina. She was raised in the Lviv Oblast (province). Encouraged by her mother, Ruslana studied from the age of four at an experimental musical school and sang in different bands, including in the vocal-instrumental band Horizon, the band Orion and the children's ensemble Smile. After finishing secondary school, Ruslana entered the Lviv Conservatory where she graduated as a classical pianist and symphonic orchestra conductor in 1995.\n\nRuslana started her career as the winner of the Slavianski Bazaar song competition in Vitebsk, Belarus in 1996 with the song \"Oj, letili dyki husi\". In the same year, she was among the nominees for the Ukrainian Singer of the Year award and the video for \"Dzvinkyi Viter\" (\"Wind Bells\") was awarded Music Video of the Year. Since her early career, Ruslana's producer was Oleksandr Ksenofontov, whom she married in 1995.\n\nIn 1997, Ruslana began working on \"Christmas with Ruslana\" – the first L'viv Christmas television project of an All-Ukrainian scale including the video clip \"Ballad of a Princess\" which was the first animated music video made by a Ukrainian singer.\n\nHer first album \"Myt Vesny – Dzvinkyi Viter\" (\"A Moment of Spring – Wind Bells\"), released in 1998, received high praise from the critics.\n\nStill, wider recognition did not come until 1998 with the song \"Svitanok\" (\"Sunrise\") and the album \"Myt' Vesny – Dzvinkyj Viter Live\". \"Svitanok\" was the first Ukrainian big-budget music video. In 1998, Ruslana was awarded Person of the Year, the song \"Svitanok\" was awarded Song of the Year and its accompanying music video was awarded Music Video of the Year. In the second half of 1998, she organized a charity tour which had the aim of raising funds for the restoration of the old castles from Western Ukraine. The tour was a success and thanks to Ruslana's efforts, the Zolochiv Castle was restored.\n\nIn 1999, she worked on the Christmas musical \"Ostanne rizdvo 90th\" (\"The Last Christmas of the 90s\"), which won the Ukrainian \"Movie of the Year\" award. With the video clip to the song \"Znaju ya\" (\"I Know\"), which is about the ancient people of the Hutsuls living in the Ukrainian Carpathians, Ruslana set new standards for modern video clip filming.\n\nIn 1995, Ruslana graduated from the Lviv Conservatory as professional conductor and classical pianist. She was the student of one of the most prominent Ukrainian composers and conductors, Mykola Kolessa who is regarded as 'the father of the Ukrainian conducting school'. She used to be a part of the student choir of the Lviv Music Academy.\n\nRuslana's father is from the West-Ukrainian area of the Hutsuls, the dwellers of the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains. They have a unique culture with an ancient and rich history which inspired Ruslana to create her concept album \"Wild Dances\". It combines powerful and permeating ethnic drums, trumpet sounds of the trembita, an ancient Hutsul music instrument, with modern dance beats. The album was composed by Ruslana after an expedition to the Carpathian Mountains in spring 2003.\n\nThe album \"Dyki Tantsi\" (\"Wild Dances\") was released in June 2003 in Ukraine. The album sold more than 170,000 copies in the first 100 days after its release, even without a supporting tour. Together with its English language counterpart it was the first album ever to be certified five times platinum in Ukraine, selling more than 500,000 copies, making it the most successful album in Ukraine ever.\n\nRuslana was internally chosen by the NTU to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest 2004. Before the contest, she was a hot favorite for victory by the bookmakers. At the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, she performed her self-composed song, \"Wild Dances\" and won the contest receiving 280 points. In the semifinal, the song received points from all other participating countries; in the final, Switzerland was the only country not giving any points to the song.\n\nThe single \"Wild Dances\" stayed a total of 97 weeks in various European single charts. It was certified gold in Belgium, Sweden, Russia, Greece, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In Belgium it topped the single charts at #1 for 10 consecutive weeks. Also in Ukraine and Greece the song peaked at #1. The English language album \"Wild Dances\" was released in many European countries in the autumn of 2004. In Las Vegas she received the World Music Award as best selling Ukrainian artist.\n\nAfter her victory Ruslana was appointed advisor to the Ukrainian prime minister, and the Ukrainian president bestowed upon her one of the country's highest honors when she received the title of People's Artist of Ukraine.\n\nIn Belgium she was among the top 15 ranked performers with her singles \"Wild Dances\" and \"Dance with the Wolves\". Ruslana was named the most popular person in Belgium, the sexiest girl in Greece, the most influential public person in Ukraine and was the first foreigner to receive the award of the Federation of Journalists in Turkey.\n\nRuslana had been initially chosen to host the semi final and the grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. However, the singer had to decline the offer due to her involvement in the organization of a big charity concert dedicated to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster. Therefore, Ruslana appeared at the event only as a guest star. She performed a medley of \"Wild Dances\" and \"Heart on Fire\" at the opening ceremony being accompanied by the Zhyttia ballet and the Ukrainian drums ensamble ARS Nova. After interviewing the competitors in the green room she also performed her latest single \"The Same Star\". During this performance Ruslana wore a red costume inspired by Ukrainian ethnic elements.\n\nAlso in 2005, Ruslana designed the cover for Jonathan Safran Foer's \"The Unabridged Pocket Book of Lightning\" which was produced as part of Penguin Books' 70th birthday celebrations.\n\nRuslana's song \"Wild Dances\" was named the Best of Eurovision in an internet voting arranged by the German public television broadcaster ARD. During the television program \"Grand Prix Hitliste\", \"Wild Dances\" was presented as the winner, ahead of famous songs, such as \"Waterloo\" and Germany's only winner (at the time), \"Ein Bißchen Frieden\", which finished sixth and twelfth, respectively. The programme was viewed by a television audience of approximately six million people in Germany.\n\nFor the FIFA World Cup 2006 Ruslana went on tour in Germany to support the Ukrainian national football team. She performed in Hamburg, Cologne, Berlin, Leipzig, and Nuremberg.\n\nRuslana's project \"Wild Energy\" was based on the science fiction novel by Maryna and Sergij Diachenko \"Wild Energy. Lana\". In a future city which experiences a global energy crisis, far more threatening than lack of oil and gas, people are lacking their will to live, their energy of the heart – the \"fuel for people\". Lana, one of the synthetic inhabitants, sets out to find the mystical energy source. After many adventures she discovers that the wild energy comes from her own heart.\nWild Energy combines the art of music and video production, literature and social commitment in an extraordinary way. In June 2006 Ruslana presented the new single and video \"Wild Energy\" in a unique fantasy style. In this video clip the singer develops from a synthetic blonde girl into her wild image.\n\nIn March 2008 Ruslana's Ukrainian album \"Amazonka\" was released in Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia. The English album \"Wild Energy\" was released by Warner Music in Canada and several European countries in autumn 2008.\n\nThe album was recorded at the Hit Factory Studio in Miami and contains two collaborations with American Urban superstars T-Pain and Missy Elliott. On this release Ruslana creates her own distinctive technique of incorporating ancient ethnic styles of the Carpathian Mountain people with modern popular music.\n\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Ruslana lends her voice as the host of Vladivostok FM. Her song \"Wild Dances\" is featured as one of the songs on Vladivostok. On 13 May 2008, \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" broke the Guinness World Records for \"Highest grossing video game in 24 hours\" and \"Highest Revenue Generated by an Entertainment Product in 24 Hours\". It sold 3.6 million copies on day one generating $310 million in revenue.\n\nIn 2009, she was invited to attend the sixth Asia Song Festival which took place in Seoul, Korea. The event was held at the Seoul World Cup Stadium where Ruslana sung in front of an audience of 60,000 people. Together with the \"Zhyttia\" ballet, she performed three songs from her first international album: \"Wild Dances\", \"Dance with the Wolves\" and a bilingual version of \"Play, Musician!\". Her act was met with great enthusiasm by the Asian public who didn't know her until that moment. Even if she was supposed to receive only an award for her contribution to the cultural exchange between Ukraine and Asia in music, in the end she also won the main award of the festival, receiving the golden statue for the best artist of the Asia Song Festival 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Ruslana was appointed as one of the judges of the Ukrainian version of \"The Voice\" show. Her involvement in the project was featured on the Dutch TV where the original show of the series kicked off. Eventually, Ruslana's alumni, Tonya Matvienko, placed 2nd in the grand final of the Ukrainian show.\n\nAlso in 2011, her song \"Wild Dances\" was used by the American gymnast Jordyn Wieber as the soundtrack for her floor exercise. Wieber eventually became the 2011 World Women's All-Around Champion and won the golden medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics performing her floor exercise on Ruslana's song.\n\nIn April 2012 the new Ukrainian language album \"ЕЙ-форі-Я\" (\"EY-fori-YA\") was released in Ukraine. The album on which Ruslana had worked for four years was produced in the USA, Sweden and Ukraine produced by Vlad Debriansky and Ruslana and features musicians such as Rusty Allen, Victor Little, George Benson, Brian Coller and others.\n\nDespite its intercontinental rock and pop nature, the album \"EY-fori-YA\" and the three songs taken from it previously is based on Slavic rhythms. Ruslana integrated old Slavic circle dances, liturgies and elements of classic pieces of Russian composers including Glinka, Tschaikowsky, Mussorgsky, and Rachmaninow.\nThe album is designed for flash mob type synchronous dances. In April/May 2012 she toured 11 Ukrainian cities with a unique show concept called \"OGO Show\". During these open-air events Ruslana appeared as lead dancer teaching the audience the moves. The audience doesn't consume passively, but is integrated into the show. More concept concerts followed within the framework of the \"EURO 2012\" public fan events.\n\nHer third international album was set to be released in 2013 under the title \"My Boo! (Together!)\". The new material shows how versatile Ruslana is as an artist as she completely changed her style since the \"Wild Energy\" project, from a wild Amazon to a Urban pop princess.\n\nMost of the album was produced by Vlad DeBriansky in Los Angeles and includes the names of American top musicians such as Rusty Allen, Victor Little, Oscar Seaton, Brian Coller as well as Stefan Örn from Sweden who won the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 as a songwriter. Goran Bregovich, the legendary Balkan musician from Serbia produced the song \"Kray\"\n\nAt the same time of the release of the new English album Ruslana's Ukrainian album \"ЕЙ-форі-Я\" (\"EY-fori-YA\", \"Euphoria\") was re-released under the new title \"Мій Брат! (разом)\" (\"Miy Brat! (razom!)\", \"My Brother! (together!)\"). The renaming of the album had become necessary because of the coincidental same name of the winning song of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. The Swedish singer Loreen won the event with the song \"Euphoria\", one month after Ruslana had released her Ukrainian album and song of the same name. In order to avoid misunderstandings Ruslana's renamed not only her album but also her English song \"Euphoria\" into \"This Is Euphoria\".\n\nIn August 2013 Ruslana globally released the single \"This Is Euphoria\" digitally. The track was composed and produced by Ruslana and the Swedish musician Stefan Örn.\n\nShe was invited to perform at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2013 which took place in her country's capital Kiev. Nevertheless, she withdrew her act from the show considering the violence shown by the Ukrainian authorities against those who were peacefully protesting in the country's capital.\n\nShe was one of the coaches of the first season of the Clash of the Choirs TV show in Ukraine. Ruslana and her alumni from the city of Lviv have won the grand final of the project on 5 January 2014, receiving 78% of the tele voting.\n\nIn January 2014 her international album \"My Boo! (Together!)\" was released digitally. For her subsequent album Ruslana intended to study again ethnic motifs as she regarded the Wild Dances project as her most creative work. Due to her active involvement in the Euromaidan in Ukraine, Ruslana had to postpone her musical plans.\n\nRuslana was invited as music expert for Eurosong, the Belgian selection for the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest in order to choose the best candidate to represent Belgium at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014.\n\nOn 9 and 10 October Ruslana held two concerts at the Manchester Ukrainian Cultural Centre 'Dnipro'. She originally planned on performing only one show however as the tickets sold out within hours, it was decided that she would perform a second concert the next day. Tickets for that show were also almost sold out.\n\nOn 24 October, Ruslana performed a concert along with the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus in Massey Hall in Toronto. The purpose of the concert was to showcase the beauty and the importance of the Bandura in Ukrainian music and culture. For her final song, Ruslana performed along with the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus as well as the Zoloti Struny Youth Bandura Ensemble based in Toronto. Ruslana was a juror for the Ukrainian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. Out of the three jury members, she was the only one who supported the singer Jamala who later on became the second Eurovision winner from Ukraine.\n\nIn late 2016, after Jamala's victory at Eurovision in Stockholm, Ruslana played 3 concerts in Western Europe. In October she played in London, in November she played in Paris and in December she played in Hanover (Hannover). In all of these concerts she spoke about the victory that Jamala brought for Ukraine, and how Ukraine would be opening up to the world again in May 2017.\n\nAfter her long-lasting creative break, which was caused by the dramatic and stormy events in Ukraine, Ruslana presented her new single \"It's Magical / Я люблю\" at the Eurovision Grand Finale in Kyiv on 13 May 2017. The new music style combines tender cradle songs with brisk exotic melodies and rhythms. The original, exotic manner of singing which forms the basis of the soundtrack Ruslana acquired on sometimes extreme expeditions into the Carpathian Mountains. The song was released in an English (\"It's Magical\") and a Ukrainian version (\"Я люблю\" / \"Ya lyublyu\" / \"I Love\").\n\nThe film production took place in a unique place, the Basalt quarry in the Rivne region. Director Oles Sanin created a thunder storm in a realistic way for the video clip. The image of Ruslana in the chainmail in which she appears in the clip resembles her internal state. After all the events in her country and her extreme expeditions into the mountains, Ruslana feels like a kind of warrioress who is called to protect the most valuable: Love. In her song, video Ruslana wants to draw attention to the widespread deforestation in the Carpathians. Her aim is the preservation of the Carpathian primeval forests, their unique wildlife, and exceptional culture.\n\nIn autumn 2004 Ruslana actively supported the democratic processes in Ukraine known as the Orange Revolution, to which her song \"Dance with the Wolves\" was devoted. She declared her support for Viktor Yushchenko during the disputed Ukrainian presidential elections. She became one of the prominent figures that addressed the mass crowds rallying in support of Yushchenko's demand that his original defeat be declared fraudulent.\nFrom spring 2006 to summer 2007 she was a Member of the Ukrainian Parliament for the party Our Ukraine.\n\nDue to political reasons the music video supporting her second single extracted from the \"Wild Dances\" album, \"Dance with the Wolves\" was censored in Russia as it contains fragments showing Ruslana in the Independence Square.\n\nRuslana endorsed Yulia Tymoshenko during the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election and actively supported her candidature during the election campaign.\n\nIn December 2012 Ruslana launched the human rights campaign \"Не мовчи\" (\"Don't keep silent\") which challenges the juridical system of Ukraine. In particular she supports the case of Dmytro and Sergiy Pavlichenko who claim to have been forced to admit a murder they have not committed. The father and son were convicted of killing a judge of a district court in Kyiv and sentenced to life imprisonment and 13 years in prison respectively. The verdict was widely criticized mainly by football fans. Ruslana dedicated her song and video \"Це – Ей-форі-Я\" (\"This is Euphoria\") to the case of the Pavlichenkos who according to her are victims of a misjudgement.\n\nRuslana was one of the leading figures of the pro-EU protests known as Euromaidan. On 22 November 2013, Ukrainian citizens started spontaneous protests in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, after the Ukrainian government had suspended preparations for signing an Association Agreement with the European Union.\nFrom the first day of the protests she stayed on Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti virtually all night, up to ten hours a night. In an interview with The Daily Beast on 11 December 2013 she explained her role in the opposition as \"charging Maidan with freedom-loving energy\", insisted she \"hates\" politics and denied supporting any single leader.\n\nIn total Ruslana spent at least 100 days and 100 nights on the Maidan stage during the cold winter inspiring the crowds, giving speeches and singing the Ukrainian national anthem every hour day after day and night after and night, often sleeping just a couple of hours on the floor of the Trade Union building occupied by the protesters. As a symbol of people power, peace and freedom she established holding up flashlights while singing the Ukrainian national anthem.\n\nWhen during the night of 30 November 2013 the riot police wanted to clear the occupied Maidan and started beating up peacefully sleeping activists Ruslana rushed for help and managed to seek shelter with about 100 students, some of them wounded, in a nearby monastery. During another night in December 2013 when the riot police advanced again towards the square Ruslana did her utmost to deescalate the situation by talking to them from the stage repeating over and over again \"Quiet! No violence!\". She gave the protesters the courage to peacefully withstand more than 2,000 riot police who eventually retreated.\n\nHer commitment in the pro-European movement was featured in many international publications. While the American press regarded her as the 'true heroine of Ukraine', the German magazine \"Spiegel\" called her 'Kiev's queen of the night', and the Spanish newspaper \"El Mundo\" compared her to Jeanne d'Arc The media even compared her to Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of The Hunger Games trilogy. The Russian \"Forbes\" magazine included her in the top 10 of the most influential women of 2013 and the \"Business Ukraine\" magazine named her 'person of the year'.\n\nFrom January 2014 Ruslana started to meet with key EU and U.S. politicians asking for support for Ukraine. Her first appearance in this role at the 495th Plenary Session of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and a meeting with José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, resulted in a resolution of the EESC to support the Ukrainian civil society and its democratic rights. In the following months Ruslana travelled to Stockholm, Paris, Warsaw, Brussels, Vienna, Strasbourg, Berlin, Munich, São Paulo, Washington D.C. and New York speaking to leading government officials demanding international support. In addition she gave the mass media in various countries an authentic view on the events in Ukraine.\n\nHer activism put herself in serious danger. She received numerous death threats on her phone, her car was followed and she couldn't live in her house for several weeks because it was constantly observed. Snipers aimed at her while she was standing on the Maidan stage. The threats started after she started demanding sanctions from the EU governments against the Yanukovych government. Ruslana had also noted the presence of paid provocateurs who have instigated fights in the otherwise peaceful protests. After President Viktor Yanukovych had fled the country in late February 2014 and the fights in Ukraine escalated Ruslana targeted Russian President Vladimir Putin as aggressor and demanded sanctions against him and his government. In Washington D.C. she stated: \"Putin's propaganda is a machine against the truth. Putin started his terrorist operation in Eastern Ukraine and is preparing his way to Kyiv. Russia's special forces, terrorist, are invading Ukraine. … Tomorrow we will wake up and see that Putin took away everything he wanted.\"\n\nFor her extraordinary courage, commitment and dedication Ruslana was honoured with several awards including the International Woman of Courage Award, awarded by First Lady Michelle Obama at the Woman in the World Summit in New York and the 2014 Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award from at the Atlantic Council in Washington D.C.\n\nOn 24 May 2014, the day before the Presidential election in Ukraine which happened to be also her birthday, Ruslana organized a global joint prayer which involved one million people in several countries highlighting the unity of Ukrainians across the world and the global support for Ukraine. Ruslana herself read the prayer \"For Ukraine, for peace and quiet\" and performed the Ukrainian national anthem in 12 languages on Mount Khomyak in the Carpathian Mountains.\n\nIn 2004-2005 Ruslana was appointed Good Will Ambassador of Ukraine by the UNICEF and combats trafficking in human beings. She released two video clips which aim to make potential victims aware of the dangers of human trafficking. In February 2008 Ruslana performed at an anti-human trafficking event in Vienna, Austria, organized by UN.GIFT (The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking) in front of 117 international delegations. Her song \"Not for Sale\" became the anthem of the anti-trafficking campaign.\n\nWithin the frames of the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 in Kiev she gave a charity concert for children suffering from the consequences of the Chernobyl tragedy. For another charity project Ruslana joined forces with German rock star Peter Maffay. In April/May 2007 they went together with artists from 14 countries on a four weeks tour through Germany. The funds gathered benefited children in need.\n\nRuslana has also staged numerous charity concerts benefiting Children's hospitals in Kiev, Lviv and Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nWith her project Wild Energy Ruslana supports the use of renewable energy. She regards the energy of the sun, the water and the wind as an energy independence. The project gradually developed into this bigger meaning. Ruslana wants to make people aware of the dangers of global climate change.\n\nAfter large regions in Western Ukraine were hit by a flood in July 2008 Ruslana set up the co-ordinating and relief centre \"Carpathians. Flood. SOS! 2008\". The aim of the centre is to create a database of the people in need, to provide emergency humanitarian help and to collect and distribute donations both from the public and from other Ukrainian artists and sportsmen to support the victims of the flood.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54663520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54663520", "title": "Samūm", "text": "Samūm\n\nSamūm ( also spelled \"Simoom\" or \"Semum\"; from the root \"s-m-m\", \"to poison\") is a Quranic term referring to infernal heat and in Extra-Quranic accounts, also to a kind of demon. In the tormenting fires of Jahannam are called \"samūm\" and it is also mentioned in as the origin of Jann. In non-Arabic Qur'anic translations, the term is often translated with \"scorching fire\" or \"scorching winds\", because apart from its Islamic usage, samūm also refers to a hot, dusty desert wind.\nBoth terms may be linguistically related to Samael, an Archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic literature, who envied humanity and in charge of destructive demons, similar to the Islamic legends about demons created from samūm, envying Adam.\n\nTabari offers many interpretations for the nature of samūm. In one interpretation he provides, samūm is \"hot wind which kills\" and in another \"the flame of the fire of the hot wind\" and yet in another he relates it to \"night-wind\" in opposition to \"harur\" (day-wind). Further he states, some hold samūm to be the hell-fire (\"nar jahannama\"). On the authority of Abu Ubaidah, samūm is the fire that \"penetrates the pores due to its fineness in the day-time as well as at night\". Abu Sãlih is reported as saying that samūm is \"smokeless fire\" located between the heavens and the veil. According to Ibn Abbas, the samūm is \"the worst hot fire which kills\". On the authority of 'Amir ibn Dinar, samūm is the fire of the sun. According to Ibn Kathir, samūm is the \"flame of the fire\", which is \"the best fire\".\n\nIn one narration, the samūm is a sapient creature, which stayed loyal to God until the creation of Adam. Afterthat, they envied mankind and their ardor turned into hatred, therefore they were cast away from God's mercy. Satan, who also disaproved the creation of mankind, became their leader and the samūms his most loyal servants.\n\nTabari recorded a similar story authorized by Ibn Abbas, that a pre-adamitic creature was once loyal to God and subordinative to Iblis, and fought against the Jinn. But after God created humanity, they envied the new creation and became demons. However Tabari called these demons \"Hinn\" instead of \"samūm\". But depicted \"samūm\" as their origin in contrast to the Jinn, who were created from \"smokeless fire\".\n\nFurthermore, some legends relate \"samūm\" to the mother of demons, created by God as a wife for Iblis, after the latter was banished from heaven.\n\nThe 2008 Turkish horror film Semum is about \"samūm\", allegedly based on different independently narrations about possessed people, claiming to encountered a samūm.\n\n"}

In 1954, he briefly joined the British Army as an IRA agent and collected intelligence on Gough Barracks in Armagh and supplied it to the IRA in Dublin. This enabled the IRA to carry out a successful arms raid on 12 June 1954, with Garland's active involvement on the base. Garland deserted from the British army in October of the same year, before his regiment was due to depart for Kenya. He became a full-time IRA training officer.\n\nOn 1 January 1957 at the beginning of the IRA Border Campaign, he led the unsuccessful attack on Brookeborough Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in which his associates Seán South and Fergal O'Hanlon, both the subjects of well-known republican ballads, were shot and fatally wounded. Under fire, Garland carried South on his shoulders in an unsuccessful attempt to save his friend's life. Seriously wounded, he was subsequently hospitalised for a number of weeks and was then jailed in Mountjoy Prison. In November 1957, while in Mountjoy, Garland was an unsuccessful candidate in the Dublin North-Central by-election. Upon his release, he was interned in the Curragh, but was released in 1959.\n\nGarland returned to IRA service on his release and was sent to Belfast to liaise with the then largely inactive units in the city. He was arrested while trying to return to Dublin and sentenced in November 1959 to four years in Crumlin Road Gaol where he subsequently became officer commanding (O.C.) of the IRA prisoners.\n\nIn the 1960s, Garland became a Marxist and was one of a generation of IRA leaders who attempted to lead the organisation away from violence and into left-wing political agitation. He worked closely in this with figures such as Cathal Goulding and Tomás MacGiolla. During the 1969/70 IRA split, Garland supported the moves to abandon abstentionism and was a key figure in Official Sinn Féin (as national organiser) and Official Irish Republican Army (as Adjutant-General). The Official IRA was openly involved in shootings and bombings of military and civilian targets but declared a ceasefire in May 1972. Despite this, the Official IRA continued to carry out shootings and robberies during the 1970s and was engaged in a number of feuds with the Provisional IRA and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).\n\nOn 1 March 1975 in Ballymun, Dublin, Garland survived an INLA assassination attempt while returning home with his wife Mary to his Ballymun home. He was badly wounded in the attack. In 1977, Garland was elected general secretary of Official Sinn Féin. In the same year, he successfully proposed that the party be renamed Sinn Féin the Workers Party. In 1982, he proposed that the prefix Sinn Féin be dropped from the party name to become simply The Workers' Party. \n\nIn 1999 Garland was allegedly observed visiting the North Korean embassy in Moscow. It was subsequently alleged that he visited to collect forged US dollars which, with the help of associates, would be transported to Dublin and Birmingham where the notes would be exchanged for pounds or authentic dollars. The US authorities announced that this scheme, which they said involved several international crime syndicates and transactions worth millions of dollars, had been uncovered in \"Operation Mali\".\n\nSeán Garland was the Workers' Party representative at the National Forum on Europe. In 2000, he was elected president of the Workers' Party.\n\nIn 1988 Sean Garland asked the KGB to provide \"special training\" to up to five members of the Workers' Party in order to improve party security. This request was made through the KGB station chief in Dublin, with whom Sean Garland had \"confidential contacts\". The head of the KGB, Vladimir Kryuchkov, viewed the request positively. However, on 12 January 1989, the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union turned it down, fearing that leaked news of such cooperation would damage the Soviet relationship with the United Kingdom. Copies of Kryuchkov's letter and of the Central Committee decision can be found in an archive of classified documents smuggled out of Russia by Vladimir Bukovsky.\n\nOn 7 October 2005, Garland was arrested in Belfast on foot of an extradition application issued by the US authorities. He had been attending the Workers' Party Ardfheis/Annual Conference at the time. The United States authorities alleged that Garland had been involved in the distribution and resale of counterfeited US dollars - so-called \"superdollars\" or \"supernotes\" - in 1998. They also alleged that the source of the banknotes was the government of North Korea. Garland was released on bail.\n\nA campaign was then launched against the US extradition attempt. His supporters claimed the U.S. waited for Garland to travel north of the Irish border before seeking his extradition, believing the United Kingdom authorities would be more willing to acquiesce than those in the Republic of Ireland. In June 2007 the Irish edition of the Mail on Sunday speculated that there was evidence that the affair was a US plot to provide a pretext for a military attack on North Korea \n\nOn 9 October 2005, a \"Sunday Times\" article alleged that Garland became chief of staff of the largely inactive Official IRA in 1998.\n\nOn 1 December, the High Court in Belfast issued a warrant for Garland's arrest after he failed to appear for an extradition hearing. On 1 April 2006, Garland was unanimously re-elected as President of The Workers' Party and in a keynote address to the party membership gathered in Dublin he vowed to fight any attempt to extradite him to the United States. In 2008 he announced his intention to retire from the presidency and was replaced in the position on 17 May 2008 by Mick Finnegan. Garland remained a member of the party's Central Executive Committee and was its National Treasurer.\n\nGarland was subsequently arrested in Dublin in 2009 and the application by the U.S. to extradite him was heard in 2011.\n\nThe campaign against his extradition continued, bringing in a number of prominent individuals from outside the Workers' Party including its Honorary Chairman the Rev. Chris Hudson. It sought and received support from numerous political figures from across the spectrum in Ireland, the United Kingdom and further afield. Among these were dozens of members of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament), MEPs and local politicians. Garland also received support from the entertainment industry including musicians Pete Seeger, Christy Moore, Alabama 3 and John Spillane. Garland's supporters pointed out that the 77-year-old had been diagnosed from a number of serious medical conditions including diabetes and bowel cancer.\n\nOn 21 December 2011, Justice John Edwards in the High Court dismissed the US application for Garland's extradition. Justice Edwards told the court he was not disposed to grant the application and would furnish his reasons for doing so later.\n\nOn 27 January 2012, Justice Edwards stated that since the offence for which the US wanted to extradite was regarded as having been committed in Ireland the Court was prohibited from extraditing Garland. He was therefore obliged to refer the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions who would consider whether there was a case for prosecuting Garland in Ireland.\n\nOn 29 May 2012, Garland spoke at the funeral of his comrade Noel Cullen, alongside Cullen's son Jake. Noel Cullen was a key figure in The Workers Party who died of cancer at the age of 52. Garland spoke on his friends passion, humanity, and quest for knowledge before handing Jake and Noel's daughter Ríona a starry plough, and an Irish flag. \n\n\n"}

In June 2010 she was appointed as Managing Director of the World Bank Group and resigned as Minister of Finance. On July 27, 2016, Sri Mulyani was reappointed as Minister of Finance in a cabinet reshuffle by President Joko Widodo, replacing Bambang Permadi Soemantri Brodjonegoro.\n\nAs finance minister from 2005 to 2010, Sri Mulyani was known as a tough reformist and was largely credited with strengthening Indonesia's economy, increasing investments and steering Southeast Asia's largest economy through the 2007–10 financial crisis.\nIn 2014, she was ranked as the 38th most powerful woman in the world by \"Forbes\" magazine.\n\nSri Mulyani was born in Tanjung Karang (now called Bandar Lampung) in Lampung, Sumatra, on August 26, 1962. She is the seventh child of university lecturers Prof. Satmoko and Retno . \n\nShe obtained her degree from Universitas Indonesia in 1986. Sri Mulyani received her master and doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1992. In 2001, Mulyani left for Atlanta, Georgia, to serve as a consultant with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) for programs to strengthen Indonesia’s autonomy. She also lectured on the Indonesian economy as visiting professor at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at the Georgia State University. From 2002 to 2004 she was an executive director on the board of the International Monetary Fund representing 12 economies in Southeast Asia.\n\nShe is married to economist Tony Sumartono, with whom she has three children. She is a professional economist and has no political affiliation.\n\nSri Mulyani was selected as Indonesian Finance Minister in 2005 by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. One of her first acts was to fire corrupt tax and custom officers in the department. She successfully tackled corruption and initiated reforms in Indonesia's tax and customs office and enjoys a reputation for integrity. She succeeded in increasing direct investment in Indonesia. In 2004, the year President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono took office, Indonesia received $4.6 billion in foreign direct investment. The next year, it attracted $8.9 billion.\n\nIn 2006, just one year after selected, she was named Euromoney Finance Minister of the Year by \"Euromoney\" magazine.\n\nDuring her tenure in 2007, Indonesia recorded 6.6% economic growth, its highest rate since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. However, growth is down in 2008 to 6% due to the global economic slowdown. In July 2008, Sri Mulyani Indrawati was inaugurated as the Coordinating Minister for the economy, replacing Boediono, who was to head the central bank.\n\nIn August 2008, Mulyani was ranked by \"Forbes\" magazine as the 23rd most powerful woman in the world and the most powerful woman in Indonesia. During her tenure as Finance Minister, the country's foreign exchange reserves reached an all-time high of $50 billion. She oversaw a reduction in public debt to about 30% of gross domestic product from 60%, making it easier for Indonesia to sell debt to foreign institutional investors. She also revised incentive structures for civil servants in her ministry and began paying higher salaries to tax officials deemed to be \"clean\" so they would have less temptation to accept bribes.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, \"Emerging Markets\" newspaper selected Sri Mulyani as Asia's Finance Minister of The Year.\nAfter Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was re-elected in 2009, she was re-appointed in her post of Finance Minister. In 2009 the Indonesian economy grew up by 4.5% while many part of the world is in recession. Indonesia is one of just three major emerging economies to grow faster than 4% in 2009. The other two are China and India. Under her supervision, government has managed to increase the number of income taxpayers from 4.35 million individuals to nearly 16 million in the last five years, and tax receipts grew by around 20% each year to more than Rp 600 trillion in 2010.\n\nIn November 2013, British newspaper The Guardian published article with report from leaks by Edward Snowden, showing that Australian intelligence had allegedly hacked into mobile phones of top Indonesian leaders in 2009. This included Sri Mulyani which at that time was the minister of finance. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended it by saying that the activities were not so much \"spying\" as \"research\" and that its intention would always be to use any information \"for good\".\n\nOn May 5, 2010 Mulyani was appointed as one of three Managing Directors of the World Bank Group. She replaced Juan Jose Daboub, who completed his four-year term June 30, overseeing 74 nations in Latin America, Caribbean, East Asia and Pacific, Middle East and North Africa.\n\nHer resignation was viewed negatively and caused financial turmoil in Indonesia, with the stock exchange closing down 3.8% after the news, amid a broad sell off in Asia, while the Indonesian rupiah fell nearly 1% against the dollar. The drop in Indonesian stock exchange was the sharpest in 17 months. The move has been called as \"Indonesia’s loss, and the World’s gain\".\n\nThere was widespread speculation that her resignation was due to political pressure, especially from powerful tycoon and chairman of Golkar Party, Aburizal Bakrie.\nBakrie is known to have enmity toward Mulyani due to her investigation into massive tax fraud in the Bakrie Group, her refusal to prop up Bakrie's coal interests with government funds, and her refusal to state that the Sidoarjo mud flow, which is widely believed to have been caused by drilling of Bakrie's company, was a \"natural disaster\".\n\nOn May 20, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono named as her replacement Agus Martowardojo, CEO of Bank Mandiri, the largest bank in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2014, she was ranked as the 38th most powerful woman in the world by \"Forbes\".\n\nRight before her resignation, The Legislature, spearheaded by Golkar Party, accused Sri Mulyani of a crime with the bailout of medium scale Bank Century in 2008. Critics of the bailout claim it was done without legal authority and without proving a capital injection was needed to prevent a run on other banks, Bank Century bailout cost the state to suffer a financial lost amounting to 6.7 trillion rupiah ($710 million). Sri Mulyani has defended the bailout as necessary given the uncertainties in the global economy at the time and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, criticism about Sri Mulyani's policy also came from ex vice president Jusuf Kalla. In his harshest comments yet on the controversial PT Bank Century bailout, former Vice President Jusuf Kalla denied claims by former Bank Indonesia officials that if the lender had been allowed to fail it would have had a systemic impact on the country’s banking system and economy.\n\n“The Bank Century scandal is a robbery, anyone who supports Bank Century, supports a robber.” Kalla said.\n\nFurthermore, all of the nine factions on the House of Representatives special committee agreed that there were suspicious and possibly fraudulent transactions during the bailout period beginning in November 2008 and evidence of money laundering. They all then said they lacked the expertise to do more and called on the National Police and Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) to take over.\n"}

His debut album \"Now\" appeared in 1982, followed by \"Structures from Silence\" in 1984. In 1986 he released his acclaimed \"Quiet Music\" series. In 1988, he released what has been described by critics as his masterpiece, the double-album \"Dreamtime Return\".\n\nAs Roach's approach to ambient music has matured, his compositions have typically been beatless. His rhythmic and trance-based groove and tribal-ambient releases, however, are nearly as numerous as his more atmospheric releases. Some recordings are strictly synthesizer-based, whereas others include ambient guitar experiments. \n\nOther pieces, however, cross over with more ethnic and folk influences. Roach learned to play the digeridoo during his extended trips to Australia in the 1980s, and he became an early proponent of its use in ambient music. His work with Mexican musician Jorge Reyes introduced Roach to Prehispanic musical elements, which he has also included in his music. These fusions established Roach as one of the founders of the tribal-ambient sound.\n\nRoach is married to author and equine teacher Linda Kohanov (who provided vocals on some of his albums).

The same publisher, Victor Gollancz, had recently published \"The Outsider\", the first book by Holroyd's friend Colin Wilson. Wilson and Holroyd, along with the novelist Bill Hopkins, were associated with the literary movement known as the Angry Young Men. In the same year, Holroyd, Wilson and Hopkins each contributed an essay to \"Declaration\" - an anthology of statements by writers and artists then labelled, rightly or wrongly, as Angry Young Men (the contributors included not only John Osborne and Kingsley Amis but Doris Lessing and the director Lindsay Anderson). On 9 March 1958, Holroyd's play, \"The Tenth Chance\" was produced at the Royal Court Theatre; disturbances in the audience during the single performance, and a subsequent confrontation in a nearby public house involving Kenneth Tynan, Christopher Logue and Colin Wilson were widely reported.\n\n\"Emergence from Chaos\" was a literary/psychological study of several modern poets. Holroyd's next book, \"Flight and Pursuit\" (1959) was an autobiographical examination of the author's search for \"spiritual values\".\n\nIn 1961, Holroyd married Susan Joy Bennett. (He was earlier married to Anne Elizabeth Freeman, they married in 1950 and divorced in 1958.) With the exception of a textbook on English literature (\"The English Imagination\"), Holroyd did not publish another book for sixteen years. \"Contraries; A Personal Progression\", which appeared in 1975, was a memoir of the \"angry\" years of the late 1950s, containing portraits of Wilson and Hopkins.\n\nHolroyd thereafter turned his attention to different subjects, writing a series of books on the paranormal, parapsychology, encounters with extraterrestrial life, gnosticism and the philosophy of Krishnamurti—work which he later described as \"whoring\" in the literary market place.\n\nHis most recent publication, \"His Dear Time's Waste\" (Pronoia Books, 2013) is described as \"a 1950s literary and love life memoir,\" a re-issue of the amended text of \"Contraries\", with substantial additions derived from journals, correspondence and other early writings, together with reflections from a present point of view.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20121240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20121240", "title": "Yi Yuanji", "text": "Yi Yuanji\n\nYi Yuanji (; Wade-Giles: I Yüan-chi) (c. 1000, Changsha, Hunan – c. 1064) was a Northern Song Dynasty painter, famous for his realistic paintings of animals. According to Robert van Gulik, Yi Yuanji's paintings of gibbons were particularly celebrated.\nThe 11th-century critic Guo Ruoxu (郭若虚) in his \"Overview of Painting\" (图画见闻志, \"Tuhua Jian Wen Zhi\") tells this about Yi's career:\n\nHe spent months roaming the mountains of southern Hubei and northern Hunan, watching roebucks (獐鹿) and gibbons (猿狖) in their natural environment.\nIn 1064, Yi Yuanji was invited to paint screens in the imperial palace. Once this job has been completed, the Yingzong Emperor, impressed, commissioned him to paint the \"Picture of a Hundred Gibbons\", but unfortunately the artist died after painting only a few gibbons. A few of his other gibbon paintings have survived, and Robert van Gulik, quite familiar with the behavior of this ape, comments on how naturally they look in the pictures. His other work includes depictions of deer, peacocks, birds-and-flowers and fruits-and-vegetables; many of them are kept in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The \"Monkey and Cats\" painting is especially charming. Van Gulik identifies the monkey as a macaque. This painting was featured on a 2004 \"Year of the Monkey\" stamp from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nThe image of Yi Yuanji, with his intimate knowledge of nature, has attracted attention from modern Chinese painters.\n"}
