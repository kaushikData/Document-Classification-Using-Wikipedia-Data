He is estimated to have had a peak net worth of around US$4 billion in the early 1980s.\n\nKhashoggi was born in Mecca, the son of Mohammad Khashoggi, who was King Abdul Aziz Al Saud's personal doctor. His family is of Turkish origin, although Khashoggi himself has also said that he had a Jewish grandfather. Adnan Khashoggi's sister was author Samira Khashoggi who married businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed and was the mother of Dodi Fayed. Another sister, Soheir Khashoggi, is a well-known Arab writer (\"Mirage\", \"Nadia's Song\", \"Mosaic\"). He was an uncle of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nKhashoggi was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and the American universities California State University, Chico, Ohio State, and Stanford. Khashoggi left his studies in order to seek his fortune in business.\n\nKhashoggi's early years were spent among some of Saudi Arabia's most influential figures. \"While attending school he met Hussein bin Talal, the future King of Jordan. It was at school that Khashoggi first learned the commercial value of facilitating a deal, bringing together a Libyan classmate whose father wanted to import towels with an Egyptian classmate whose father manufactured towels, earning US$1,000 for the introduction. Khashoggi's subsequent education at university would serve as a launchpad for his commercial career.\"\n\nIn one of his first big deals, a large construction company was experiencing difficulties with the trucks that it used on the shifting desert sands. Khashoggi, using money given to him by his father for a car, bought a number of Kenworth trucks, whose wide wheels made traversing the desert considerably easier. Khashoggi made his first US$250,000 leasing the trucks to the construction company, and became the Saudi Arabia-based agent for Kenworth.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Khashoggi helped bring together Western companies and the Saudi Arabian Government to satisfy the needs of the young Kingdom for its infrastructure and defense needs. Between 1970 and 1975, Lockheed paid Khashoggi $106 million in commissions. His commissions started at 2.5% and eventually rose to as much as 15%. Khashoggi \"became for all practical purposes a marketing arm of Lockheed. Khashoggi would provide not only an entrée but strategy, constant advice, and analysis\", according to Max Helzel, then vice president of Lockheed's international marketing.\n\nA commercial pioneer, he established companies in Switzerland and Liechtenstein to handle his commissions as well as developing contacts with notables such as CIA officers James H. Critchfield and Kim Roosevelt and United States businessman Bebe Rebozo, a close associate of U.S. President Richard Nixon. His yacht, the \"Nabila\", was the largest in the world at the time and was used in the James Bond film \"Never Say Never Again\". After Khashoggi ran into financial problems he sold the yacht to the Sultan of Brunei, who in turn sold it for $29 million to Donald Trump, who sold it for $20 million to Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal as part of a deal to keep his Taj Mahal casino out of bankruptcy.\n\nKhashoggi headed a company called Triad International Holding Company, which among other things built the Triad Center in Salt Lake City, which later went bankrupt. He was famed as an arms dealer, brokering deals between US firms and the Saudi government, most actively in the 1960s and 1970s. In the documentary series \"The Mayfair Set\", Saudi author Said Aburish states that one of Khashoggi's first weapons deals was providing David Stirling with weapons for a covert mission in Yemen during the Aden Emergency in 1963. Among his overseas clients were defense contractors Lockheed Corporation (now Lockheed Martin Corporation), Raytheon, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and Northrop Corporation (the last two of which have now merged into Northrop Grumman).\n\nTriad International is a multi-national private investment corporation that was owned by Khashoggi. Its investments include many notable properties and businesses throughout the world. The company consisted of subsidiary companies, including Triad Management, Triad Properties, Triad Energy, Triad Technology, and Triad Financial resources.\n\nThe Global span of the businesses prompted the creation by the Khashoggi family of a board-game called Triopoly which was modeled after the classic game of Monopoly. The various game tiles represented properties and companies owned by Khashoggi and his Triad corporation. The game was manufactured and given to family and friends.\n\nTriad International was formed in the early 1960s and as it grew spanned five continents. The company holdings included hotels, shopping centers, banks, oil refineries, a computer manufacturer, a gold mine, construction companies, car and truck franchises, and a professional sports team, the Utah Jazz.\n\nThe company was headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland with its subsidiary companies located in the United States, Canada, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nKhashoggi, through Triad, owned the Mount Kenya Safari Club, known as Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a several hundred acre reserve at the foot of Mount Kenya, San Francisco Town Center East a $250 million property, Long Beach Edgington Oil a $250 million per year oil refinery, Santa Ana based ATV computer systems, Arizona, Colorado Land & Cattle company, Security National bank in Walnut Creek, CA, Barrick gold mine in Toronto, Canada, Saudi Arabian Kenworth, Chrysler and Fiat car and truck dealerships, the National Gypsum company in Saudi Arabia, and Sahuaro Petroleum in Phoenix, AZ.\n\nThe company also had major financial interests in Lloyd's of London, The Manera company, Las Brisas Resort in Acapulco, Mexico, The Houston Galleria, National car rental, Pyramid Oasis in Cairo, Egypt, Travel Lodge Australia, Pacific Harbor hotel in Fiji, Beirut Riyadh bank, and the bank of Contra Costa.\n\nKhashoggi's Triad real estate holdings included private residences in Beirut, Lebanon, Jeddah and Riyadh Saudi Arabia, Geneva, Switzerland, Cairo, Egypt, Salt Lake City Utah, Cone Ranch, Florida, Rome, Italy, Paris and Cannes, France, London, England, and a multi-floor penthouse in Olympic towers in New York.\n\nKhashoggi also owned several private jets, and super-yachts through Triad, including a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 and DC-9, three Boeing 727's, and several smaller business jets and helicopters. His three super-yachts, the Nabila, The Mohammadia, and the Khalida,were named after his children, Nabila, Mohammed, and Khalid.\n\nKhashoggi was implicated in the Iran–Contra affair as a key middleman in the arms-for-hostages exchange along with Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and, in a complex series of events, was found to have borrowed money for these arms purchases from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) with Saudi and United States backing. His role in the affair created a related controversy when Khashoggi donated millions to the American University in Washington, DC to build a sports arena which would bear his name. Khashoggi was a member of the university's board of trustees from 1983 until his indictment on fraud and other charges in May 1989.\n\nIn 1988, Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland, accused of concealing funds, and held for three months. Khashoggi stopped fighting extradition when the U.S. prosecutors reduced the charges to obstruction of justice and mail fraud and dropped the more serious charges of racketeering and conspiracy. In 1990, a United States federal jury in Manhattan acquitted Khashoggi and Imelda Marcos, widow of the exiled Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, of racketeering and fraud.\n\nIn 1991 Khashoggi made an extended appearance on the British television programme \"After Dark\", alongside, among others, former Prime Minister Edward Heath and Lord Weidenfeld.\n\nKhashoggi was a financier behind Genesis Intermedia, Inc. (formerly NASDAQ: GENI), a publicly traded Internet company based in the US. In 2006, Khashoggi was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for securities fraud. The case was settled in 2008 and Khashoggi did not admit or deny the allegations.\n\nIn January 2003, Seymour Hersh reported in \"The New Yorker\" magazine that former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle had a meeting with Khashoggi in Marseille in order to use him as a conduit between Trireme Partners, a private venture capital company of which he was one of three principals, and the Saudi government. At the time, Perle was chair of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, a Defense Department advisory group, which provided him with access to classified information and a position to influence defense policy.\n\nKhashoggi told Hersh that Perle talked to him about the economic costs regarding a proposed invasion of Iraq. \"'If there is no war,' he told me, 'why is there a need for security? If there is a war, of course, billions of dollars will have to be spent.'\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Khashoggi married 20-year-old Englishwoman Sandra Daly who converted to Islam and took the name Soraya Khashoggi. They raised one daughter (Nabila) and four sons together (Mohammed, Khalid, Hussein, and Omar). Another daughter, Petrina, was born after the couple divorced in 1974 but assumed to be Adnan's, until a DNA test in 1999 revealed that her father was Conservative party politician Jonathan Aitken.\n\nHis second wife, the Italian Laura Biancolini, also converted to Islam and changed her name to Lamia Khashoggi. She was seventeen when she met Adnan; together they had a son, Ali.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Khashoggi family occupied one of the largest villa estates in Marbella, Spain, called \"Baraka\", hosting lavish parties. Guests at these parties included film stars, pop celebrities and politicians. In 1985, celebrity reporter Robin Leach reported Khashoggi threw a five-day birthday party in Vienna for his eldest son, and in his heyday, Khashoggi spent $250,000 a day to maintain his lifestyle.He continued to spend lavishly even when he encountered financial problems. His net worth was said to have been down to about 8 million in 1990.\n\nKhashoggi also owned Ol Pejeta Conservancy, in Laikipia County, Kenya. His house has since been converted into a hotel which is run by Serena Hotels.\n\nKhashoggi died on 6 June 2017 while being treated for Parkinson's disease at the Harley Street Clinic in London. He was 81.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Later, he decided to become a Fool for Christ, living out his goal with humility and patience.\n\nAccording to certain sources, Andrew had a vision of Most Holy Theotokos in the Blachernae church of Constantinople, while the city was surrounded by enemy troops (by some sources, Muslim Arabs).\n\nAndrew and his disciple Epiphanus testified that they saw the Holy Virgin surrounded by many angels and Saints, praying and extending her homophorion (protection) over the faithful. After this vision, Constantinople was saved when its attackers retreated. That vision and the avoidance of Constantinople's destruction that was attributed to it inspired the creation of one of the most famous Eastern Orthodox holidays: the feast of the Protection of the Theotokos.\n\nAndrew died in 936. His memory is commemorated by Eastern Orthodox communities on October 15 (Oct. 2 old calendar). The earliest manuscript of his Greek hagiography is a quire in Munich in a 10th-century uncial script.

Lasso and Sri Noerhida. His mother told him that he could become a famous singer, saying that \"[his] life should be beautiful\" because of his voice. While attending high school at SMA Negeri 2 Surabaya, he established Outsider Band along with the drummer Wawan Juniarso, from Dewa 19, and guitarist Piyu of Padi. After graduating from high school, he attended Airlangga University and earned a degree in economics.\n\nLasso eventually became a member of Dewa 19 together with Wawan Juniarson, Andra Junaidi, Ahmad Dhani, and Erwin Prasetya. With Dewa 19, he released the album \"Kangen\", which was chosen as the best album of the year by BASF in 1993.\n\nBeginning after Dewa 19's third album, Lasso used drugs heavily; his drug addiction led to him being fired by the band in 2001 and going bankrupt. In order to overcome his addiction, he tried going to rehab and alternative medicine; he was also hospitalized and put under isolation at home. All of these efforts were to no avail. After promising his dying mother that he would beat his addiction, he became more adamant in attempting to recover, eventually succeeding. He also quit his 20-year habit of smoking in 2010, after his son began taking and destroying his cigarettes.\n\nAfter his dismissal from Dewa 19, Lasso became a solo singer. He released his first solo album, the commercially successful \"Sendiri Dulu\", that year. Two years later, he released \"Keseimbangan\", which featured two songs performed with Dhani. In 2004 he released \"Kulihat Kudengar dan Kurasakan\", of which two songs became used for the movie \"Mengejar Matahari\" (\"Chasing the Sun\"). In 2006, he released the album \"Selalu Ada\", while the following year his album \"The Best of\" included a duet with Bunga Citra Lestari.\n\nIn 2009 rumours spread that Lasso would become mute due to damage to his voice box; although he did not perform for four months during that period, he performed in a series of concerts between May and June of that year. Lasso has expressed interest in becoming a music producer if he can no longer be a singer.\n\nIn 2012, Lasso released a compilation album, Yang Terbaik. The album was only sold at KFC outlets in Indonesia. The album compiled top hit singles and six new songs, \"Kisah Kita\", \"Karena Aku Tlah Denganmu\", \"Cintailah Aku Sepenuh Hati\", \"Satu Cinta\", \"Doa Untuk Cinta\" and \"Cinta Adalah Misteri\". Lasso also includes musicians who merged his albums sold in KFC stores like Cinta Laura, Indah Dewi Pertiwi, Agnes Monica, SM*SH, T.R.I.A.D, Rossa, Slank, Last Child, Ello, Sammy Simorangkir, Armada and Ungu.\n\nIn 2016, Ari Lasso joined the judging panel of the season 2 of \"The Voice Indonesia\".\n\nWhen not busy with music, Lasso tries to participate in his children's lives, assisting with their homework and attending school performances. Lasso has noted that Mitch Albom's \"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\" has influenced his parenting style and belief that a parent's interest in their children's lives can be a large influence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "80696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80696", "title": "Cher", "text": "Cher\n\nCher (; born Cherilyn Sarkisian; May 20, 1946) is an American singer and actress. Commonly referred to by the media as the Goddess of Pop, she has been described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. She is known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances during her six-decade-long career.\n\nCher gained popularity in 1965 as one-half of the folk rock husband-wife duo Sonny & Cher after their song \"I Got You Babe\" reached number one on the American and British charts. By the end of 1967, they had sold 40 million records worldwide and had become, according to \"Time\" magazine, rock's \"it\" couple. She began her solo career simultaneously, releasing in 1966 her first million-seller song, \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". She became a television personality in the 1970s with her shows \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\", watched by over 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, and \"Cher\". She emerged as a fashion trendsetter by wearing elaborate outfits on her television shows.\n\nWhile working on television, Cher established herself as a solo artist with the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", \"Half-Breed\", and \"Dark Lady\". After her divorce from Sonny Bono in 1975, she launched a comeback in 1979 with the disco album \"Take Me Home\" and earned $300,000 a week for her 1980–1982 concert residency in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 1982, Cher made her Broadway debut in the play \"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean\" and starred in its film adaptation. She subsequently earned critical acclaim for her performances in films such as \"Silkwood\" (1983), \"Mask\" (1985), and \"Moonstruck\" (1987), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She then revived her musical career by recording the rock-inflected albums \"Cher\" (1987), \"Heart of Stone\" (1989), and \"Love Hurts\" (1991), all of which yielded successful singles such as \"I Found Someone\", \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" and \"Love and Understanding\".\n\nCher reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the album \"Believe\", whose title track became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. It features the pioneering use of Auto-Tune, also known as the \"Cher effect\". Her 2002–2005 became one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time, earning $250 million. In 2008, she signed a $180 million deal to headline the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for three years. In 2018, Cher returned to film for her first on-screen role since 2010's \"Burlesque\", starring in the musical romantic comedy film \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\". Inspired by the film, the album \"Dancing Queen\" (2018) debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200, tying with 2013's \"Closer to the Truth\" for Cher's highest-charting solo album in the U.S.\n\nCher has won a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Cannes Film Festival Award, a special CFDA Fashion Award, and a Kennedy Center Honors prize, among several other honors. She has sold 100 million records worldwide to date, becoming one of the best-selling music artists in history. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a \"Billboard\" chart in six consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2010s. Outside of her music and acting, she is noted for her political views, philanthropic endeavors, and social activism, including LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS prevention.\n\nCher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. Her father, John Sarkisian, was an Armenian-American truck driver with drug and gambling problems; her mother, Georgia Holt (born Jackie Jean Crouch), was an occasional model and bit-part actress who claimed Irish, English, German, and Cherokee ancestry, though Cher is predominantly Armenian. Cher's father was rarely home when she was an infant, and her parents divorced when Cher was ten months old. Her mother later married actor John Southall, with whom she had another daughter, Georganne, Cher's half-sister.\n\nNow living in Los Angeles, Cher's mother began acting while working as a waitress. She changed her name to Georgia Holt and played minor roles in films and on television. Holt also secured acting parts for her daughters as extras on television shows like \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\". Her mother's relationship with Southall ended when Cher was nine years old, but she considers him her father and remembers him as a \"good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much\". Holt remarried and divorced several more times, and she moved her family around the country (including New York, Texas, and California). They often had little money, and Cher recounted having had to use rubber bands to hold her shoes together. At one point, her mother left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks. Although they met every day, both found the experience traumatic.\n\nWhen Cher was in fifth grade, she produced a performance of the musical \"Oklahoma!\" for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to her role in the 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate. She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, \"I couldn't think of anything that I could do ... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal.\"\n\nIn 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under the name Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and enrolled them at Montclair College Preparatory School, a private school in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, \"[she] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality.\" A former classmate commented, \"I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special ... She was like a movie star, right then and there ... She said she was going to be a movie star and we knew she would.\" Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher's unconventional behavior stood out: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, \"I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous.\"\n\nAt age 16, Cher dropped out of school, left her mother's house, and moved to Los Angeles with a friend. She took acting classes and worked to support herself, dancing in small clubs along Hollywood's Sunset Strip and introducing herself to performers, managers, and agents. According to Berman, \"[Cher] did not hesitate to approach anyone she thought could help her get a break, make a new contact, or get an audition.\" Cher met performer Sonny Bono in November 1962 when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Cher's friend moved out, and Cher accepted Sonny's offer to be his housekeeper. Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a backup singer on many recordings, including the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\". Spector produced her first single, the commercially unsuccessful \"Ringo, I Love You\", which Cher recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason.\n\nCher and Sonny became close friends, eventual lovers, and performed their own unofficial wedding ceremony in a hotel room in Tijuana, Mexico, on October 27, 1964. Although Sonny had wanted to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her because she suffered from stage fright, and he began joining her onstage, singing the harmonies. Cher disguised her nervousness by looking at Sonny; she later commented that she sang to the people through him. In late 1964, they emerged as a duo called Caesar & Cleo, releasing the poorly received singles \"Do You Wanna Dance?\", \"Love Is Strange\", and \"Let the Good Times Roll\".\n\nCher signed with Liberty Records' Imperial imprint in the end of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single \"Dream Baby\", released under the name \"Cherilyn\", received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of Bob Dylan's \"All I Really Want to Do\", which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds' single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, \"We loved the Cher version ... We didn't want to hassle. So we just turned our record over.\" Cher's debut album, \"All I Really Want to Do\" (1965), reached number 16 on the \"Billboard\" 200; it was later described by AllMusic's Tim Sendra as \"one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era\".\n\nIn early 1965, Caesar and Cleo began calling themselves Sonny & Cher. Following the recording of \"I Got You Babe\", they traveled to England in July 1965 at the Rolling Stones' advice; Cher recalled, \"[they] had told us ... that Americans just didn't get us and that if we were going to make it big, we were going to have to go to England.\" According to writer Cintra Wilson, \"English newspaper photographers showed up when S&C were thrown out of the London Hilton [because of their outfits] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars. London went gaga for the heretofore-unseen S&C look, which was neither mod nor rocker.\"\n\n\"I Got You Babe\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and became, according to AllMusic's Bruce Eder, \"one of the biggest-selling and most beloved pop/rock hits of the mid-'60s\"; \"Rolling Stone\" listed it among \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2003. As the song knocked the Beatles off the top of the British charts, English teenagers began to emulate Sonny and Cher's fashion style, such as bell-bottoms, striped pants, ruffled shirts, industrial zippers and fur vests. Upon their return to the U.S., the duo made several appearances on the teen-pop showcases \"Hullabaloo\" and \"Shindig!\" and completed a tour of some of the largest arenas in the U.S. Their shows attracted Cher look-alikes—\"girls who were ironing their hair straight and dyeing it black, to go with their vests and bell-bottoms\". Cher expanded her creative range by designing a clothing line.\n\nSonny and Cher's first album, \"Look at Us\" (1965), released for the Atco Records division of Atlantic Records, spent eight weeks at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200, behind the Beatles' \"Help!\". Their material became popular, and the duo successfully competed with the dominant British Invasion and Motown sounds of the era. Sonny and Cher charted ten \"Billboard\" top 40 singles between 1965 and 1972, including five top-ten singles: \"I Got You Babe\", \"Baby Don't Go\", \"The Beat Goes On\", \"All I Ever Need Is You\", and \"A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done\". At one point, they had five songs in the top 50 at the same time, a feat equaled only by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. By the end of 1967, they had sold 40 million records worldwide and had become, according to \"Time\" magazine's Ginia Bellafante, rock's \"it\" couple.\n\nCher's following releases kept her solo career fully competitive with her work with Sonny. \"The Sonny Side of Chér\" (1966) features \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", which reached number two in America and became her first million-seller solo single. \"Chér\", also released in 1966, contains the Burt Bacharach and Hal David composition \"Alfie\", which was added to the credits of the American version of the 1966 film of the same name and became the first stateside version of the popular song. \"With Love, Chér\" (1967) includes songs described by biographer Mark Bego as \"little soap-opera stories set to rock music\" such as the U.S. top-ten single \"You Better Sit Down Kids\".\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, Sonny and Cher's music had ceased to chart. According to Berman, \"the heavy, loud sound of groups like Jefferson Airplane and Cream made the folk-rock music of Sonny and Cher seem too bland.\" Cher later said, \"I loved the new sound of Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, the electric-guitar oriented bands. Left to myself, I would have changed with the times because the music really turned me on. But [Sonny] didn't like it—and that was that.\" Their monogamous lifestyle during the period of the sexual revolution and the anti-drug position they adopted at the height of the drug culture lost them popularity among American youths. According to Bego, \"in spite of their revolutionary unisex clothes, Sonny and Cher were quite 'square' when it came to sex and drugs.\" In an attempt to recapture their young audience, the duo produced and starred in the film \"Good Times\" (1967), which was commercially unsuccessful.\n\nCher's next album, \"Backstage\" (1968), in which she runs in diverse musical directions, including Brazilian jazz and anti-war protest settings, was not a commercial success. In 1969, she was dropped from Imperial Records. Sonny and Cher had been dropped from Atco; however, the label wanted to sign Cher for a solo album. \"3614 Jackson Highway\" (1969) was recorded without the guidance of Sonny and incorporates experiments in soul music; AllMusic's Mark Deming proclaimed it \"the finest album of her career\". Displeased with the \"3614 Jackson Highway\" album, Sonny prevented Cher from releasing more recordings for Atco.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonny dated others, and by the end of the 1960s their relationship had begun to unravel. According to \"People\" magazine, \"[Sonny] tried desperately to win her back, telling her he wanted to marry and start a family.\" They officially married after she gave birth on March 4, 1969, to Chastity Bono (who later became Chaz Bono).\n\nThe duo spent $500,000 and mortgaged their home to make the film \"Chastity\" (1969). Written and directed by Sonny, who did not appear in the movie, it tells the story of a young woman, played by Cher, searching for the meaning of life. The art film failed commercially, putting the couple $190,000 in debt with back taxes. However, some critics noted that Cher showed signs of acting potential; \"Cue\" magazine wrote, \"Cher has a marvelous quality that often makes you forget the lines you are hearing.\"\n\nAt the lowest point of their career, the duo put together a nightclub routine that relied on a more adult approach to sound and style. According to writer Cintra Wilson, \"Their lounge act was so depressing, people started heckling them. Then Cher started heckling back. Sonny ... reprimanded her; then she'd heckle Sonny\". The heckling became a highlight of the act and attracted viewers. Television executives took note, and the couple began making guest appearances on prime-time shows, in which they presented a \"new, sophisticated, and mature\" image. Cher adopted alluring, low-cut gowns that became her signature outfits.\n\nCBS head of programming Fred Silverman offered Sonny and Cher their own television program after he noticed them as guest-hosts on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" in 1971. \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" premiered as a summer replacement series on August 1, 1971, and had six episodes. Because it was a ratings success, the couple returned that December with a full-time show.\n\nWatched by more than 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" was praised for the comedic timing, and deadpan Cher mocked Sonny about his looks and short stature. According to Berman, they \"exuded an aura of warmth, playfulness, and caring that only enhanced their appeal. Viewers were further enchanted when a young Chastity also appeared on the show. They seemed like a perfect family.\" Cher honed her acting skills in sketch comedy roles such as the brash housewife Laverne, the sardonic waitress Rosa, and historical vamps, including Cleopatra and Miss Sadie Thompson. The Bob Mackie designed clothing Cher wore was part of the show's attraction, and her style influenced the fashion trends of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1971, Sonny and Cher signed with the Kapp Records division of MCA Records, and Cher released the single \"Classified 1A\", in which she sings from the point of view of a soldier who bleeds to death in Vietnam. Written by Sonny, who felt that her first solo single on the label had to be poignant and topical, the song was rejected by radio station programmers as uncommercial.\n\nSince Sonny's first attempts at reviving their recording career as a duo had also been unsuccessful, Kapp Records recruited Snuff Garrett to work with them. He produced Cher's first U.S. solo number-one single, \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", which \"proved that ... Garrett knew more about Cher's voice and her persona as a singer than Sonny did\", writes Bego. \"Billboard\" called it \"one of the 20th century's greatest songs\". It was featured on the 1971 album \"Chér\" (eventually reissued under the title \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\"), which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its second single, \"The Way of Love\", reached number seven on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and established Cher's more confident image as a recording artist.\n\nIn 1972, Cher released the all-ballad set \"Foxy Lady\", demonstrating the evolution of her vocal abilities, according to Bego. Following the release of the album, Garrett quit as producer after disagreeing with Sonny about the kind of material Cher should record. At Sonny's insistence, in 1973 Cher released an album of standards called \"Bittersweet White Light\", which was commercially unsuccessful. That year, lyricist Mary Dean brought Garrett \"Half-Breed\", a song about the daughter of a Cherokee mother and a white father, that she had written especially for Cher. Although Garrett did not have Cher as a client at the time, he was convinced that \"it's a smash for Cher and for nobody else\", so he held the song for months until he got Cher back. \"Half-Breed\" was featured on the album of the same name and became Cher's second U.S. solo number-one single. Both the album and the single were certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nCher's third U.S. solo number-one single was \"Dark Lady\", in 1974, from the namesake album. Later that year, she released a \"Greatest Hits\" album that, according to \"Billboard\" magazine, proved her to be \"one of the most consistent hitmakers of the past five years\", as well as a \"proven superstar who always sells records\".\n\nBetween 1971 and 1973, Sonny and Cher's recording career was revived with four albums released under Kapp Records and MCA Records: \"Sonny & Cher Live\" (1971), \"All I Ever Need Is You\" (1972), \"Mama Was a Rock and Roll Singer, Papa Used to Write All Her Songs\" (1973), and \"Live in Las Vegas Vol. 2\" (1973). Cher later commented on this period: \"I could do a whole album ... in three days ... We were on the road ... and we were doing the Sonny & Cher Show\".\n\nCher and Sonny had marital problems since late 1972, but appearances were maintained until 1974. \"The public still thinks we are married,\" Sonny wrote in his diary at the time, \"[and] that's the way it has to be.\" In February 1974, Sonny filed for a separation, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". A week later, Cher countered with a divorce suit and charged Sonny with \"involuntary servitude\", claiming that he withheld money from her and deprived her of her rightful share of their earnings. The couple battled in court over finances and the custody of Chastity, which was eventually granted to Cher. Their divorce was finalized on June 26, 1975.\n\nIn 1974, Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\". The same year, Sonny premiered a solo show on ABC, \"The Sonny Comedy Revue\", which carried the creative team behind the Sonny and Cher show. It was canceled after 13 weeks.\n\nDuring the divorce proceedings, Cher had a two-year romantic relationship with record executive David Geffen, who freed her from her business arrangement with Sonny, under which she was required to work exclusively for Cher Enterprises, the company he ran. Geffen secured a $2.5 million deal for Cher with Warner Bros. Records, and she began work on her first album under that label in 1975. According to Bego, \"it was their intention that [this album] was going to make millions of fans around the world take her seriously as a rock star, and not just a pop singer.\"\n\nDespite Cher's efforts to develop her musical range by listening to artists such as Stevie Wonder, Elton John, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell, and Bob Dylan, the resulting album \"Stars\" was commercially and critically unsuccessful. Janet Maslin of \"The Village Voice\" wrote, \"Cher is just no rock and roller ... Image, not music, is Cher Bono's main ingredient for both records and TV.\" The album has since become a cult classic and is generally considered among her best work.\n\nOn February 16, 1975, Cher returned to television with a solo show on CBS. Called \"Cher\", it began as a highly rated special with guests Flip Wilson, Elton John, and Bette Midler. The show was produced by Geffen and centered on Cher's songs, monologues, comedy performance, and her variation of clothing, which was the largest for a weekly TV show. Early critical reception was favorable; the \"Los Angeles Times\" exclaimed that \"Sonny without Cher was a disaster. Cher without Sonny, on the other hand, could be the best thing that's happened to weekly television this season.\" \"Cher\" lasted for less than a year, replaced by a new show in which she professionally reunited with ex-husband Sonny; she said, \"doing a show alone was more than I could handle.\"\n\nOn June 30, 1975, four days after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock musician Gregg Allman, co-founder of The Allman Brothers Band. She filed for divorce nine days later because of his heroin and liquor problems, but they reconciled within a month. They had one son, Elijah Blue, on July 10, 1976. Sonny and Cher's TV reunion, \"The Sonny and Cher Show\", debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple. Although the show was a ratings success on its premiere, Cher and Sonny's insulting onscreen banter about their divorce, her reportedly extravagant lifestyle, and her troubled relationship with Allman caused a public backlash that eventually contributed to the show's cancellation in August 1977.\n\nIn 1976, Mego Toys released a line of toys and dolls in the likeness of Sonny and Cher, which coincided with the popularity of \"The Sonny and Cher Show\". The miniature version of Cher ended up being the highest selling doll of 1976, surpassing Barbie.\n\nCher's next albums, \"I'd Rather Believe in You\" (1976) and \"Cherished\" (1977), the latter a return to her pop style at Warner's producers' insistence, were commercially unsuccessful. In 1977, under the rubric \"Allman and Woman\", she recorded alongside Allman the duet album \"Two the Hard Way\". Their relationship ended following the release of the album, and their divorce was finalized in 1979. Beginning in 1978, she had a two-year live-in relationship with Kiss member Gene Simmons. That year, she legally changed her name from Cherilyn Sarkisian La Piere Bono Allman to Cher, to eliminate the use of four surnames. She returned to prime time television with the specials \"Cher... Special\" (1978) and \"Cher ... and Other Fantasies\" (1979).\n\nA single mother with two children, Cher realized that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single \"Take Me Home\" and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers for more than half of 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, \"I never thought I would want to do disco ... [but] it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants.\"\n\nEncouraged by the popularity of \"Take Me Home\", Cher planned to return to rock music in her next album, \"Prisoner\" (1979). The album's cover features Cher draped in chains as a \"prisoner of the press\", which caused controversy among feminist groups for her perceived portrayal of a sex slave. She included rock songs, which made the disco release seem unfocused and led to its commercial failure. \"Prisoner\" produced the single \"Hell on Wheels\", featured on the soundtrack of the film \"Roller Boogie\". The song exploits the late 1970s roller-skating fad and contributed to its popularity.\n\nIn 1980, alongside Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder, Cher wrote her last Casablanca disco recording, \"Bad Love\", for the film \"Foxes\". She formed the rock band Black Rose that year with her then-lover, guitarist Les Dudek. Although Cher was the lead singer, she did not receive top billing because she wanted to create the impression that all band members were equal. Since she was easily recognized when she performed with the band, she developed a punk look by cutting her trademark long hair. Despite appearances on television, the band failed to earn concert dates. Their album \"Black Rose\" received unfavorable reviews; Cher told \"Rolling Stone\", \"The critics panned us, and they didn't attack the record. They attacked me. It was like, 'How dare Cher sing rock & roll?'\"\n\nDuring Black Rose's active period, Cher was simultaneously doing a concert residency in Las Vegas, earning $300,000 a week. Its companion television special \"Cher ... A Celebration at Caesars\" aired on Lifetime in April 1983. Black Rose disbanded in 1981. That year, she released a duet with musician Meat Loaf called \"Dead Ringer for Love\", which reached number five on the UK Singles Chart and was later described by AllMusic's Donald A. Guarisco as \"one of the more inspired rock duets of the 1980s\". In 1982, Columbia Records released the album \"I Paralyze\", later deemed by Bego as Cher's \"strongest and most consistent solo album in years\" despite its low sales.\n\nWith decreasing album sales and a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career. While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies \"Good Times\" and \"Chastity\" to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress. She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with Lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors Studio, but never enrolled after her plans changed. She auditioned for and was signed by director Robert Altman for the Broadway stage production \"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean\", playing a member of a James Dean fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the film adaptation of the same title. Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: \"Without Bob [Robert Altman] I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me ... I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it.\"\n\nDirector Mike Nichols, who had seen Cher onstage in \"Jimmy Dean\", offered her the part of Dolly Pelliker, a plant co-worker and Meryl Streep's lesbian roommate in the film \"Silkwood\". When it premiered in 1983, audiences questioned Cher's ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience laughed when they saw her name in the credits. For her performance, Cher received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.\n\nIn 1985, Cher formed the film production company Isis. Her next film, \"Mask\" (1985), reached number two at the box office and was Cher's first critical and commercial success as a leading actress. For her role as a drug addict biker with a teenage son who has a severe physical deformity, she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. During the making of the film, however, she clashed with director Peter Bogdanovich. She attended the 58th Academy Awards in a tarantula-like costume \"to show her scorn for the 'system'\", according to authors James Parish and Michael Pitts. The incident garnered her much publicity.\n\nBy 1987, Cher was receiving attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men. She had romantic relationships with actors Val Kilmer, Eric Stoltz, and Tom Cruise, hockey player Ron Duguay, film producer Josh Donen, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, and Rob Camilletti, an 18-years-younger bagel baker whom she dated from 1986 to 1989.\n\nCher starred in three films in 1987. In \"Suspect\", she played a public defender who is both helped and romanced by one of the jurors in the homicide case she is handling. Along with Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, she starred as one of three divorcees involved with a mysterious and wealthy visitor from hell who comes to a small New England town in the comedy horror \"The Witches of Eastwick\". In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy \"Moonstruck\", she played an Italian widow in love with her fiancé's younger brother. The two latter films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively.\n\n\"The New York Times\"' Janet Maslin wrote \"Moonstruck\" \"offers further proof that Cher has evolved into the kind of larger-than-life movie star who's worth watching whatever she does.\" For that film, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had become one of the most bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1 million per film. That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15 million in its first year sales.\n\nIn 1987, Cher signed with Geffen Records and revived her musical career with what music critics Johnny Danza and Dean Ferguson describe as \"her most impressive string of hits to date\", establishing her as a \"serious rock and roller ... a crown that she'd worked long and hard to capture\". Michael Bolton, Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child, and Richie Sambora produced her first Geffen album, \"Cher\", which was certified platinum by the RIAA. It features the rock ballad \"I Found Someone\", her first U.S. top-ten single in more than eight years.\n\nCher's 19th studio album \"Heart of Stone\" (1989) was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The music video for its second single, \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", caused controversy due to Cher's performance on a Navy warship, straddling a cannon, and wearing a leather thong that revealed her tattooed buttocks. The song topped the Australian charts for seven weeks, reached number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and became one of Cher's most successful singles. Other songs from \"Heart of Stone\" to reach the U.S. top ten were \"After All\", a duet with Peter Cetera, and \"Just Like Jesse James\". At the 1989 People's Choice Awards, Cher won the Favorite All-Around Female Star Award. She embarked on the Heart of Stone Tour in 1990. Most critics liked the tour's nostalgic nature and admired Cher's showmanship. Its parent television special \"\" (1991) was filmed during a concert in Las Vegas.\n\nIn her first film in three years, \"Mermaids\" (1990), Cher paid tribute to her own mother in this story about a woman who moves her two daughters from town to town at the end of a love affair. She clashed with the film's first two directors, Lasse Hallström and Frank Oz, who were replaced by Richard Benjamin. Believing Cher would be the star attraction, the producers allowed her creative control for the film. \"Mermaids\" was a moderate box office success and received mixed reviews. One of the two songs Cher recorded for the film's soundtrack, \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\", topped the UK Singles Chart for five weeks.\n\nCher's final studio album for Geffen Records, \"Love Hurts\" (1991), stayed at number one in the UK for six weeks and produced the UK top-ten single \"Love and Understanding\". The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label \"hit years\" had been especially significant to her, \"because I was getting to do songs that I really loved ... songs that really represented me, and they were popular!\" She released the exercise book \"Forever Fit\" in 1991, followed by the 1992 fitness videos \"\" and \"\". She embarked on the Love Hurts Tour during 1992. That year, the UK-only compilation album \"\" peaked at number one in the country for seven weeks. It features three new songs: \"Oh No Not My Baby\", \"Whenever You're Near\", and \"Many Rivers to Cross\".\n\nPartially due to her experiences filming \"Mermaids\", Cher turned down leading roles in such films as \"The War of the Roses\" and \"Thelma & Louise\". According to Berman, \"After the success of \"Moonstruck\", she was so worried about her next career move that she was overly cautious.\" In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her too exhausted to sustain her music and film careers. Because she needed to earn money and was not healthy enough to work on other projects, she starred in infomercials launching health, beauty, and diet products, which earned her close to $10 million in fees. The skits were parodied on \"Saturday Night Live\" and critics considered them a sellout, many suggesting her film career was over. She told \"Ladies' Home Journal\", \"Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen and it didn't occur to me that people would focus on that and strip me of all my other things.\"\n\nCher made cameo appearances in the Robert Altman films \"The Player\" (1992) and \"Prêt-à-Porter\" (1994). In 1994, she started a mail-order catalogue business, \"Sanctuary\", selling Gothic-themed products, and contributed a rock version of \"I Got You Babe\" to MTV's animated series \"Beavis and Butt-head\". Alongside Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry, and Eric Clapton, she topped the UK Singles Chart in 1995 with the charity single \"Love Can Build a Bridge\". Later that year, she signed with Warner Music UK's label WEA and released the album \"It's a Man's World\" (1995), which came out of her idea of covering men's songs from a woman's point of view. In general, critics favored the album and its R&B influences, some saying her voice had improved. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"From an artistic standpoint, this soulful collection of grown-up pop songs ... is the high point of her recording career.\" \"It's a Man's World\" reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the UK top-ten single \"One by One\". Tracks were remixed for the American release of the album, abandoning its original rock sound in favor of a style more accessible to U.S. radio; it reached number 64 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nIn 1996, Cher played the wife of a businessman who hires a hitman to murder her in the Chazz Palminteri-scripted dark comedy film \"Faithful\". Although the film received negative reviews from critics, Cher was praised for her role; \"The New York Times\" Janet Maslin wrote that she \"does her game best to find comic potential in a victim's role.\" Cher refused to promote the film, claiming it was \"horrible\". She made her directing debut with a segment in the abortion-themed anthology \"If These Walls Could Talk\" (1996), in which she starred as a doctor murdered by an anti-abortion fanatic. It drew the highest ratings for an original HBO movie to date, registering an 18.7 rating with a 25 share in HBO homes and attracting 6.9 million viewers. Her music played a large role in the American TV series \"The X-Files\" episode \"The Post-Modern Prometheus\", which aired in November 1997. Written for her, it tells the story of a scientist's grotesque creature who adores Cher because of her role in \"Mask\", in which her character cares for her disfigured son.\n\nFollowing Sonny Bono's death in a skiing accident in 1998, Cher delivered a tearful eulogy at his funeral, calling him \"the most unforgettable character\" she had met. She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special \"Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers\", which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Later that year, Cher published \"The First Time\", a collection of autobiographical essays of \"first-time\" events in her life, which critics praised as down-to-earth and genuine. Although the manuscript was almost finished when Sonny died, she could not decide whether to include his death in the book; she feared being criticized for capitalizing on the event. She told \"Rolling Stone\", \"I couldn't ignore it, could I? I might have if I cared more about what people think than what I know is right for me.\" \n\nCher's 22nd studio album \"Believe\" (1998) marked a musical departure for her, as it comprises dance-pop songs, many of which capture the \"disco-era essence\"; Cher said, \"It's not that I think this is a '70s album ... but there's a thread, a consistency running through it that I love.'\" \"Believe\" was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA and went on to be certified gold or platinum in 39 countries, selling 10 million copies worldwide. The album's title track reached number one in more than 23 countries and sold over 10 million copies worldwide. It became the best-selling recording of 1998 and 1999, respectively, in the UK and the U.S., and Cher's most successful single to date. \"Believe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK, selling over 1.84 million copies in the country . It also topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart for four weeks, selling over 1.8 million units in the U.S. as of December 1999. The song earned Cher the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.\n\nOn January 31, 1999, Cher performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Super Bowl XXXIII. Two months later, she sang on the television special \"VH1 Divas Live 2\", which attracted 19.4 million viewers. According to VH1, it was the most popular, and most watched program in the television network's history, as Cher's presence was \"a huge part of making it exactly that.\" Capitalizing on the success of \"Believe\", Cher's former record company Geffen Records released the compilation album \"\" (1999), which features the previously unreleased song \"Don't Come Cryin' to Me\". It was certified gold by the RIAA. The Do You Believe? tour ran from 1999 to 2000 and was sold out in every American city it was booked in, amassing a global audience of more than 1.5 million. Its companion television special, \"Cher: Live in Concert – From the MGM Grand in Las Vegas\" (1999), was the highest rated original HBO program in 1998–99, registering a 9.0 rating among adults 18 to 49 and a 13.0 rating in the HBO universe of about 33 million homes. In November 1999, Cher released the compilation album \"The Greatest Hits\", which sold three million copies outside of the U.S. as of January 2000.\n\nCher was named the number-one dance artist of 1999 by \"Billboard\". At the 1999 World Music Awards, she received the Legend Award for her \"lifelong contribution to the music industry\". Her next film, Franco Zeffirelli's \"Tea with Mussolini\" (1999), got mixed reviews, but she earned critical acclaim for her performance as a rich, flamboyant American socialite whose visit to Italy is not welcome among the Englishwomen; one reviewer from \"Film Comment\" wrote, \"It is only after she appears that you realize how sorely she's been missed from movie screens! For Cher is a star. That is, she manages the movie star trick of being at once a character and at the same time never allowing you to forget: that's Cher.\"\n\n\"Not.com.mercial\" (2000) was written mostly by Cher after she had attended a songwriters' conference in 1994; it marked her first attempt at writing most of the tracks for an album. As the album was rejected by her record label for being uncommercial, she chose to sell it only on her website. In the song \"Sisters of Mercy\", she criticized as \"cruel, heartless and wicked\" the nuns who prevented her mother from retrieving her from a Catholic orphanage. The Catholic church denounced the song.\nCher's highly anticipated dance-oriented follow-up to \"Believe\", \"Living Proof\" (2001), entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number nine and was certified gold by the RIAA. The album includes the UK top-ten single \"The Music's No Good Without You\" and \"Song for the Lonely\", the latter song dedicated to \"the courageous people of New York\" following the September 11 attacks. In May 2002, she performed during the benefit concert \"VH1 Divas Las Vegas\". At the 2002 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, she won the Dance/Club Play Artist of the Year Award and was presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Steven Tyler for having \"helped redefine popular music with massive success on the \"Billboard\" charts\". That year, her wealth was estimated at $600 million.\n\nIn June 2002, Cher embarked on the , announced as the final live concert tour of her career, although she vowed to continue making records and films. The show highlighted her successes in music, television, and film, featuring video clips from the 1960s onwards and an elaborate backdrop and stage set-up.\n\nInitially scheduled for 49 shows, the worldwide tour was extended several times. By October 2003, it had become the most successful tour ever by a woman, grossing $145 million from 200 shows and playing to 2.2 million fans. A collection of live tracks taken from the tour was released in 2003 as the album \"Live! The Farewell Tour\". The NBC special \"Cher – The Farewell Tour\" (2003) attracted 17 million viewers. It was the highest rated network-TV concert special of 2003 and earned Cher the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special.\n\nAfter leaving Warner UK in 2002, Cher signed a worldwide deal with the U.S. division of Warner Bros. Records in September 2003. \"The Very Best of Cher\" (2003), a greatest-hits collection that surveys her entire career, peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. She played herself in the Farrelly brothers comedy \"Stuck on You\" (2003), mocking her public image as she appears in bed with a much younger boyfriend.\n\nCher's 326-date Farewell Tour ended in 2005 as one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time, seen by over 3.5 million fans and earning $250 million. After three years of retirement, she began in 2008 a three-year, 200-performance residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, for which she earned a reported $60 million per year. Titled Cher, the production featured state-of-the-art video and special effects, elaborate set designs, 14 dancers, four aerialists and more than 20 costume changes.\n\nIn \"Burlesque\" (2010), Cher's first musical film, the actress plays a nightclub impresario whom a young Hollywood hopeful is looking to impress. One of the two songs she recorded for the film's soundtrack, the power ballad \"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\", reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs chart in January 2011, making Cher the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a \"Billboard\" chart in six consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2010s. In November 2010, she received the honor of placing her handprints and footprints in cement in the courtyard in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. The next year, she lent her voice to Janet the Lioness in the comedy \"Zookeeper\". \"Dear Mom, Love Cher\", a documentary she produced about her mother Georgia Holt, aired on Lifetime in May 2013.\n\n\"Closer to the Truth\", Cher's 25th studio album and the first since 2001's \"Living Proof\", entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number three in October 2013, her highest position on that chart to date. Michael Andor Brodeur from \"The Boston Globe\" commented that \"Cher's 'Goddess of Pop' sash remains in little danger of undue snatching; at 67, she sounds more convincing than J-Lo or Madonna reporting from 'the club'\". Cher premiered the lead single \"Woman's World\" on the season four finale of the talent show \"The Voice\", her first live TV performance in over a decade. She later joined the show's season five as judge Blake Shelton's team adviser.\n\nOn June 30, 2013, Cher headlined the annual Dance on the Pier benefit, celebrating Gay Pride day. It became the event's first sellout in five years. In November 2013, she appeared as a guest performer and judge on the seventeenth season of ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\", during its eighth week, which was dedicated to her. She embarked on the Dressed to Kill Tour in March 2014, nearly a decade after announcing her \"farewell tour\". She quipped about that fact during the shows, saying this would actually be her last farewell tour while crossing fingers. The tour's first leg, which included 49 sold-out shows in North America, grossed $54.9 million. In November 2014, she cancelled all remaining dates due to an infection that affected kidney function.\n\nOn May 7, 2014, Cher confirmed a collaboration with American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan on their album \"Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\". Credited as Bonnie Jo Mason, she uses an alias of hers originated in 1964. Only one copy of the album has been produced, and it was sold by online auction in November 2015. After appearing as Marc Jacobs' guest at the 2015 Met Gala, Cher posed for his brand's fall/winter advertising campaign. The fashion designer stated, \"This has been a dream of mine for a very, very long time.\"\n\nClassic Cher, a two-year, 96-performance concert residency at both the Park Theater at Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, and The Theater at MGM National Harbor, Washington, opened on February 2017. At the 2017 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, Cher performed \"Believe\" and \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", her first awards show performance in more than 15 years, and was presented with the \"Billboard\" Icon Award by Gwen Stefani, who called her \"a role model for showing us how to be strong and true to ourselves [and] the definition of the word Icon.\"\n\nIn 2018, Cher returned to film for her first on-screen role in eight years, starring in the romantic musical comedy film \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\". \"New York\" magazine's Viviana Olen and Matt Harkins commented that \"it's only at the climax of the movie when its true promise is fulfilled: Cher arrives ... It becomes clear that every single movie—no matter how flawless—would be infinitely better if it included Cher.\" She stars as Ruby Sheridan, who is the grandmother of Sophie, played by Amanda Seyfried, and the mother of Donna, portrayed by Meryl Streep. Cher recorded two ABBA songs for the film's soundtrack: \"Fernando\" and \"Super Trouper\". Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA commented, \"She makes Fernando her own. It's her song now.\"\n\nOn March 4, 2018, Cher headlined the 40th Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Tickets sold out within three hours after she hinted her performance on her Twitter account. On May 7, 2018, Cher announced the Here We Go Again Tour, which started on September 21, 2018, and is set to finish on May 18, 2019. She stated, \"My visit to Sydney's Mardi Gras reminded me how unique and beautiful Australia is. It's been 13 years since I toured there so I thought 'let's do it one more time.'\"\n\nWhile promoting \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\", Cher confirmed she was working on an album that would feature cover versions of songs from ABBA. The album, \"Dancing Queen\", was released on September 28, 2018. Brittany Spanos from \"Rolling Stone\" commented that \"the 72-year-old makes ABBA songs not only sound like they should’ve been written for her in the first place but like they firmly belong in 2018\". Marc Snetiker from \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it Cher's \"most significant release since 1998's \"Believe\"\" and noted that \"the album ender, 'One of Us', is frankly one of Cher’s best recordings in years.\" \"Dancing Queen\" debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, tying with 2013's \"Closer to the Truth\" for Cher's highest-charting solo album in the U.S. With first-week sales of 153,000 units, it earned the year's biggest sales week for a pop album by a female artist, as well as Cher's largest sales week since 1991. \"Dancing Queen\" also topped \"Billboard\"'s Top Album Sales chart, making it Cher's first number-one album on that chart.\n\n\"The Cher Show\", a jukebox musical based on Cher's life and music, officially premiered at the Oriental Theatre, Chicago, on June 28, 2018, and is expected to debut on Broadway on December 3, 2018. Written by Rick Elice, it features three actresses playing Cher during different stages of her life. On December 2, 2018, Cher received a Kennedy Center Honors prize, the annual Washington distinction for artists who have made extraordinary contributions to culture.\n\nCher has employed various musical styles, including folk rock, pop rock, power ballads, disco, new wave music, rock music, punk rock, arena rock, and hip hop; she said she has done this to \"remain relevant and do work that strikes a chord\". Her music has mainly dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women; by doing so, she became \"a brokenhearted symbol of a strong but decidedly single woman\", according to \"Out\" magazine's Judy Wieder. \"Goldmine\" magazine's Phill Marder credited Cher's \"nearly flawless\" song selection as what made her a notorious rock singer; while several of her early songs were penned by or sung with Sonny Bono, most of her solo successes, which outnumbered Sonny and Cher's successes, were composed by independent songwriters, selected by Cher. \"Not.com.mercial\" (2000), Cher's first album mostly written by herself, presents a \"1970s singer-songwriter feel\" that proves \"Cher adept in the role of storyteller\", according to AllMusic's Jose F. Promis.\n\nRobert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" writes, \"There were a lot of great records by female singers in the early days of rock ... None, however, reflected the authority and command that we associate with rock 'n' roll today as much as [Cher's] key early hits\". Some of Cher's early songs discuss subjects rarely addressed in American popular music such as divorce, prostitution, unplanned and underaged pregnancy, and racism. According to AllMusic's Joe Viglione, the 1972 single \"The Way of Love\" is \"either about a woman expressing her love for another woman, or a woman saying au revoir to a gay male she loved\" (\"What will you do/When he sets you free/Just the way that you/Said good-bye to me\"). Her ability to carry both male and female ranges allowed her to sing solo in androgynous and gender-neutral songs.\n\nCher has a contralto singing voice, described by author Nicholas E. Tawa as \"bold, deep, and with a spacious vibrato\". Ann Powers of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a quintessential rock voice: impure, quirky, a fine vehicle for projecting personality.\" AllMusic's Bruce Eder wrote that the \"tremendous intensity and passion\" of Cher's vocals coupled with her \"ability to meld that projection with her acting skills\" can provide \"an incredibly powerful experience for the listener.\" \"The Guardian\"'s Laura Snapes described her voice as \"miraculous ... capable of conveying vulnerability, vengeance and pain all at once\". Paul Simpson, in his book \"The Rough Guide to Cult Pop\" (2003), posits that \"Cher [is] the possessor of one of the huskiest, most distinctive voices in pop ... which can work wonders with the right material directed by the right producer\". He further addresses the believability of her vocal performances: \"she spits out the words ... with such conviction you'd think she was delivering an eternal truth about the human condition\".\n\nWriting about Cher's musical output during the 1960s, Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that \"Rock was subsequently blessed with the staggering blues exclamations of Janis Joplin in the late '60s and the raw poetic force of Patti Smith in the mid-'70s. Yet no one matched the pure, seductive wallop of Cher\". By contrast, her vocal performances during the 1970s were described by Eder as \"dramatic, highly intense ... [and] almost as much 'acted' as sung\". First heard in the 1980 record \"Black Rose\", Cher employed sharper, more aggressive vocals on her hard rock-oriented albums, establishing her sexually confident image. For the 1995 album \"It's a Man's World\", she restrained her vocals, singing in higher registers and without vibrato.\n\nThe 1998 song \"Believe\" has an electronic vocal effect proposed by Cher, and was the first commercial recording to feature Auto-Tune—an audio processor originally intended to disguise or correct off-key inaccuracies in vocal music recordings—as a deliberate creative effect; according to \"Rolling Stone\"'s Christopher R. Weingarten, \"producers ... used the pitch correction software not as a way to fix mistakes in Cher’s iconic voice, but as an aesthetic tool.\" After the success of the song, the technique became known as the \"Cher effect\" and has since been widely used in popular music. Cher continued to use Auto-Tune on the albums \"Living Proof\" (2001), \"Closer to the Truth\" (2013), and \"Dancing Queen\" (2018).\n\nIn an interview in 2013, Cher reflected on how her voice had evolved during the course of her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't really like it at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the \"Toronto Sun\": \"It's so freaky because people my age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking.\"\n\nAuthor Yvonne Tasker, in her book \"Working Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Popular Cinema\" (2002), notes that Cher's film roles often mirrors her public image as a rebellious, sexually autonomous, and self-made woman. In her films, she recurrently serves as a social intermediary to disenfranchised male characters, such as Eric Stoltz's Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia victim in \"Mask\" (1985), Liam Neeson's mute homeless veteran in \"Suspect\" (1987), and Nicolas Cage's socially isolated baker with a wooden hand in \"Moonstruck\" (1987). Film critic Kathleen Rowe wrote of \"Moonstruck\" that the depiction of Cher's character as \"a 'woman on top' [is] enhanced by the unruly star persona Cher brings to the part'\". For \"Moonstruck\", Cher was ranked 1st on \"Billboard\"'s list of \"The 100 Best Acting Performances by Musicians in Movies\", and her performance was described as \"the standard by which you mentally check all others\". \"Moonstruck\" was acknowledged by the American Film Institute as the eighth best romantic comedy film of all time. Jeff Yarbrough of \"The Advocate\" wrote that Cher was \"one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and without a hint of stereotyping\", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film \"Silkwood\".\n\nCher's public image is also reflected in her music videos and live performances, in which she \"repeatedly comments on her own construction, on her search for perfection and on the performance of the female body\", wrote Tasker. Unlike other acts of that time, who often featured female backers mimicking the singer's performance, Cher uses a male dancer dressed as her in the 1992 concert video \"Cher at the Mirage\"; Author Diane Negra commented, \"In authorizing her own quotation, Cher acknowledges herself as fictionalized production, and proffers to her audience a pleasurable plurality.\" James Sullivan of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote that \"Cher is well aware that her chameleonic glitz set the stage for the current era of stadium-size razzle-dazzle. She's comfortable enough to see such imitation as flattery, not theft.\"\n\nCher was ranked 17th on VH1's list of the \"50 Greatest Women of the Video Era\". The 1980 video for \"Hell on Wheels\" involves cinematic techniques and was one of the first music videos ever. Deemed \"controversial\" for her performance on a Navy warship, straddling a cannon, and wearing a leather thong that revealed her tattooed buttocks, the 1989 music video for \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" was the first ever to be banned by MTV.\n\n\"Time\" magazine's Cady Lang described Cher as a \"cultural phenomenon [who] has forever changed the way we see celebrity fashion.\" Cher emerged as a fashion trendsetter in the 1960s, popularizing \"hippie fashion with bell-bottoms, bandanas, and Cherokee-inspired tunics\". She began working as a model in 1967 for photographer Richard Avedon after then-\"Vogue\" magazine editor Diana Vreeland discovered her at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy that year. Avedon took the controversial photo of Cher in a beaded and feathered nude gown for the cover of \"Time\" magazine in 1975. Through her 1970s television shows, she became a sex symbol with her inventive and revealing Bob Mackie-designed outfits, and fought the network censors to bare her navel. Although Cher has been erroneously attributed to being the first woman to expose her navel on television, she was the most prominent to do so since the establishment of the American Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters in 1951, which prompted network censors to ban navel exposure on U.S. television. \"People\" dubbed Cher the \"pioneer of the belly beautiful\". In 1972, after she was featured on the annual \"Best Dressed Women\" lists, Mackie stated: \"There hasn't been a girl like Cher since Dietrich and Garbo. She's a high-fashion star who appeals to people of all ages.\"\n\nIn May 1999, after the Council of Fashion Designers of America recognized Cher with an award for her influence on fashion, Robin Givhan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called her a \"fashion visionary\" for \"striking just the right note of contemporary wretched excess\". Givhan referenced Tom Ford, Anna Sui and Dolce & Gabbana as \"[i]nfluential designers [who] have evoked her name as a source of inspiration and guidance.\" She concluded that \"Cher's Native American showgirl sexpot persona now seems to epitomize the fashion industry's rush to celebrate ethnicity, adornment and sex appeal.\" \"Vogue\" proclaimed Cher \"[their] favorite fashion trendsetter\" and wrote that \"[she] set the grounds for pop stars and celebrities today\", describing her as \"[e]ternally relevant [and] the ruler of outré reinvention\". Alexander Fury of \"The Independent\" lauded Cher as \"the ultimate fashion icon\" and traced her influence among female celebrities such as Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Kim Kardashian, stating that \"[t]hey all graduated from the Cher school of never sharing the stage, with anyone, or anything ... They're trying to share the spotlight, to have Cher's success.\"\n\nCher has attracted media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her youthful looks and her tattoos. Journalists have often called her the \"poster girl\" of plastic surgery. Author Grant McCracken, in his book \"Transformations: Identity Construction in Contemporary Culture\" (2008), draws a parallel between Cher's plastic surgeries and the transformations in her career: \"Her plastic surgery is not merely cosmetic. It is hyperbolic, extreme, over the top ... Cher has engaged in a transformational technology that is dramatic and irreversible.\" Caroline Ramazanoglu, author of \"Up Against Foucault: Explorations of Some Tensions Between Foucault and Feminism\" (1993), wrote that \"Cher's operations have gradually replaced a strong, decidedly 'ethnic' look with a more symmetrical, delicate, 'conventional' ... and ever-youthful version of female beauty ... Her normalised image ... now acts as a standard against which other women will measure, judge, discipline and 'correct' themselves.\"\n\nIn 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five \"most beautiful women of history\" by creating a life-size statue. She was ranked 26th on VH1's list of the \"100 Sexiest Artists\" published in 2002.\n\nCher has six tattoos. \"The Baltimore Sun\" called her the \"Ms. Original Rose Tattoo\". She got her first tattoo in 1972. According to Sonny Bono, \"Calling her butterfly tattoos nothing was like ignoring a sandstorm in the Mojave. That was exactly the effect Cher wanted to create. She liked to do things for the shock they created. She still does. She'll create some controversy and then tell her critics to stick it.\" In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. The process was still underway in the 2000s. She commented, \"When I got tattooed, only bad girls did it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn't mean anything. No one's surprised.\"\n\nCher's presence on social media has drawn analysis from journalists. \"Time\" named her \"Twitter's most outspoken (and beloved) commentator\". \"The New York Times\" writer Jenna Wortham commended Cher on her social media usage, saying \"Most celebrities' social-media feeds feel painfully self-aware and thirsty ... In her own way, Cher is an outlier, perhaps the last unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user to stand at her digital pulpit and yell (somewhat) incomprehensibly, and be rewarded for it. Online, authenticity and originality are often carefully curated myths. Cher thrives on a version of nakedness and honesty that is rarely celebrated in the public eye.\" Monica Heisey of \"The Guardian\" called Cher's Twitter profile \"a jewel in the bizarro crown of the internet\", and stated, \"While many celebrities use Twitter for carefully crafted self-promotion, Cher just lets it all hang out.\"\n\nThe reverence held for Cher by members of the LGBT community has been attributed to her career accomplishments, her sense of style, and her longevity. Cher is considered a gay icon, and has often been imitated by drag queens. According to \"Salon\" magazine's Thomas Rogers, \"[d]rag queens imitate women like Judy Garland, Dolly Parton and Cher because they overcame insult and hardship on their path to success, and because their narratives mirror the pain that many gay men suffer on their way out of the closet.\" Cher's performance as a lesbian in the film \"Silkwood\", as well as her transition to dance music and social activism, have further contributed to her becoming a gay icon. The NBC sitcom \"Will & Grace\" acknowledged Cher's status by making her the idol of gay character Jack McFarland. Cher guest-starred as herself twice on the show, in 2000 and 2002.\n\nCher's primary philanthropic endeavors have included support of health research and patients' quality of life, anti-poverty initiatives, veterans rights, and vulnerable children.\n\nThe Cher Charitable Foundation supports international projects such as the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, Operation Helmet, and the Children's Craniofacial Association.\n\nBeginning in 1990, Cher served as a donor and as the National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson for the Children's Craniofacial Association, whose mission is to \"empower and give hope to facially disfigured children and their families\". The annual Cher's Family Retreat is held each June to provide craniofacial patients, their siblings and parents an opportunity to interact with others who have endured similar experiences. She supports and promotes Get A-Head Charitable Trust, which aims to improve the quality of life for people with head and neck diseases.\n\nCher is a donor, fundraiser, and international spokesperson for Keep a Child Alive, an organization that seeks to accelerate action to combat the AIDS pandemic, including the provision of antiretroviral medicine to children and their families with HIV/AIDS. In 1996, she hosted the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) Benefit alongside Elizabeth Taylor at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, she received the amfAR Award of Inspiration for \"her willingness and ability to use her fame for the greater good\" and for being \"one of the great champions in the fight against AIDS\".\n\nCher has been a vocal supporter of American soldiers and returning veterans. She has contributed resources to Operation Helmet, an organization that provides free helmet upgrade kits to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has contributed to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, which serves military personnel who have been disabled in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those severely injured in other operations. In 1993, she participated in a humanitarian effort in Armenia, taking food and medical supplies to the war-torn region.\n\nCher has engaged in the construction of houses with Habitat for Humanity and served as the Honorary National Chair of a Habitat's elimination of poverty housing initiative \"Raise the Roof\", an effort to engage artists in the organization's work while on tour.\n\nIn 2007, Cher became the primary supporter of the Peace Village School (PVS) in Ukunda, Kenya, which \"provides nutritious food, medical care, education and extracurricular activities for more than 300 orphans and vulnerable children, ages 2 to 13 years.\" Her support enabled the school to acquire land and build permanent housing and school facilities, and in partnership with Malaria No More and other organizations, she piloted an effort to eliminate malaria mortality and morbidity for the children, their caregivers and the surrounding community.\n\nIn 2016, after the discovery of lead contamination in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, Cher donated more than 180,000 bottles of water to the city as part of a partnership with Icelandic Glacial.\n\nCher's older child, Chaz Bono (born Chastity Bono), first came out as a lesbian at age 17, which reportedly caused Cher to feel \"guilt, fear and pain\". However, she soon came to accept Chaz's sexual orientation, and came to the conclusion that LGBT people \"didn't have the same rights as everyone else, [and she] thought that was unfair\". She was the keynote speaker for the 1997 national Parents, Families, & Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) convention, and has since become one of the LGBT community's most vocal advocates. In May 1998, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for having \"made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for lesbians and gay men\". On June 11, 2009, Chaz came out as a transgender man, and his transition from female to male was legally finalized on May 6, 2010.\n\nCher has said that she is not a registered Democrat, but has attended many Democratic conventions and events. Over the years, Cher's political views have attracted media attention, and she has been an outspoken critic of the conservative movement. In an interview with \"Vanity Fair\", she was critical of a variety of political topics, including Republican politicians like Sarah Palin and Jan Brewer. She has commented that she did not understand why anyone would be a Republican because eight years under the administration of George W. Bush \"almost killed [her]\".\n\nDuring the 2000 United States presidential election, ABC News wrote that she was determined to do \"whatever possible to keep him [Bush] out of office\". She told the site, \"If you're black in this country, if you're a woman in this country, if you are any minority in this country at all, what could possibly possess you to vote Republican? ... You won't have one fucking right left.\" She added, \"I don't like Bush. I don't trust him. I don't like his record. He's stupid. He's lazy.\"\n\nOn October 27, 2003, Cher anonymously called a C-SPAN phone-in program to recount a visit she made to maimed soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and criticized the lack of media coverage and government attention given to injured servicemen. She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, \"When I heard him talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then ... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run and no one knew exactly why ... Maybe he couldn't have withstood all the investigation that goes on now\".\n\nOn Memorial Day weekend in 2006, Cher called into C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" endorsing Operation Helmet, a group that provides helmets to help soldiers avoid head injuries while in the war zone. On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, in an interview with \"Stars and Stripes\", she explained her \"against the war in Iraq but for the troops\" position: \"I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they think is right. They do what they're told to do. They do it with a really good heart. They do the best they can. They don't ask for anything.\"\n\nCher supported Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign. After Obama won the Democratic nomination, she supported his candidacy on radio and TV programs. However, in a 2010 interview with \"Vanity Fair\", she commented that she \"still thinks Hillary would have done a better job\", although she \"accepts the fact that Barack Obama inherited insurmountable problems\". During the 2012 United States presidential election, Cher and comedian Kathy Griffin released a public service announcement titled \"Don't Let Mitt Turn Back Time on Women's Rights\". In the PSA, the pair criticized Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for his support of Richard Mourdock, the U.S. Senate candidate who suggested that pregnancies resulting from rape were \"part of God's plan\".\n\nIn September 2013, Cher declined an invitation to perform at the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Russia due to the country's controversial anti-gay legislation that overshadowed preparations for the event. In June 2015, after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, she made a series of critical comments on Twitter, stating that \"Donald Trump's punishment is being Donald Trump\".\n\n\"Forbes\" declared Cher as \"the most famous chanteuse and performer of our time\". Cher is one of the most influential and emblematic pop singers icons of the 1960s and 1970s, crossing music genres with great success during her long career. According to \"Goldmine\" magazine's Phill Marder, Cher \"has been and remains today one of the Rock Era's most dominant figures\". He described her as the leader of an effort in the 1960s to \"advance feminine rebellion in the rock world [and] the prototype of the female rock star, setting the standard for appearance, from her early hippie days to her later outlandish outfits, and her attitude—the perfect female punk long before punk even was a rock term.\" According to Jeff Miers from \"The Buffalo News\", \"Her music has changed with the times over the decades, rather than changing those times through groundbreaking work\"; however, he felt that subsequent female singers such as Cyndi Lauper, Christina Aguilera, Lady Gaga, and Madonna, whom he calls \"her generation's Cher\", were heavily inspired by Cher's abilities to combine \"showmanship with deep musicality ... to make valid statements in a wide variety of trend-driven idioms ... to ease effortlessly between pop subgenres [and] to shock without alienating her fans\", as well as by her charismatic stage presence and the strong LGBT support among her fan base. \"Billboard\"'s Keith Caulfield wrote that \"There's divas, and then there's Cher.\" She is commonly referred to by the media as the \"Goddess of Pop.\"\n\nCher has repeatedly reinvented herself through various personas, for which Professor Richard Aquila from Ball State University called her \"the ultimate pop chameleon\". According to \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s \nMarc Snetiker, \"Cher has floated through generation after generation, scooping up new fans, thrilling old ones, reinventing her own myth and glittering splendidly through it all.\" James Reed from \"The Boston Globe\" elaborates: \"Along with David Bowie, she is one of the original chameleons in pop music, constantly in flux and challenging our perceptions of her[.]\" \"The New York Times\" declared Cher as the \"Queen of the Comeback\". According to author Lucy O'Brien, \"Cher adheres to the American Dream of reinvention of self: 'Getting old does not have to mean getting obsolete.'\"\n\nAuthor Craig Crawford, in his book \"The Politics of Life: 25 Rules for Survival in a Brutal and Manipulative World\" (2007), describes Cher as \"a model of flexible career management\", and relates her career successes to a constant reshaping of her image according to the evolving trends of popular culture. He further explains that she billed \"each dramatic turnaround of style as another example of rebellion—an image that allowed her to make calculated changes while appearing to be consistent.\" Author Grant McCracken stated, \"The term 'reinvention' is now often used to talk about the careers of American celebrities. But in Cher's case, it is particularly apt [because she] is inclined to lock on to each new fashion wave [and] is swept violently down the diffusion stream and out of fashion. Only substantial re-creation permits her to return to stardom.\" Her \"integrity\" and \"perseverance\" are highlighted in the \"Reaching Your Goals\" book series of illustrated inspirational stories for children, in which her life is detailed emphasizing the importance of self-actualization: \"For years, Cher worked hard to become a successful singer. Then she worked hard to become an actress. Even when she needed money, she turned down movie roles that weren't right for her. Her goal has always been to be a good actress, not just a rich and famous one.\"\n\nCher's \"ability to forge an immensely successful and lengthy career as a woman in a male-dominated entertainment world\" has drawn attention from feminist critics. According to author Diane Negra, Cher was presented in the beginning of her career as a product of male creativity; Cher remembers, \"It was a time when girl singers were patted on the head for being good and told not to think\". However, her image eventually changed due to her \"refusal of dependence on a man and the determination not only to forge a career (as an actor) on her own terms but to refuse the conventional role assigned to women over forty years old in an industry that fetishises youth\", wrote author Yvonne Tasker. She was featured in the 16th-anniversary edition of \"Ms.\" magazine as an \"authentic feminist hero\" and a 1980s role model for women: \"Cher, the straightforward, tattooed, dyslexic single mother, the first Oscar winner to have entered into matrimony with a known heroin addict and to have admitted to being a fashion victim by choice, has finally landed in an era that's not afraid to applaud real women.\"\n\nStephanie Brush from \"The New York Times\" wrote, following the telecast of Cher's Oscar win in 1988, that she \"performs the function for women moviegoers that Jack Nicholson has always fulfilled for men. Free of the burden of ever having been America's sweetheart, she is the one who represents us [women] in our revenge fantasies, telling all the fatheads ... exactly where they can go. You need to be more than beautiful to get away with this. You need to have been Cher for 40 years.\"\n\nAlec Mapa of \"The Advocate\" elaborates: \"While the rest of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our childhood fantasies ... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to.\" \"Rolling Stone\" Jancee Dunn wrote, \"Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us.\" Alexander Fury of \"The Independent\" wrote that Cher \"represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame.\" Bego stated: \"No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage.\"\n\nAs a solo artist, Cher has sold 100 million records worldwide (in addition to 40 million as Sonny & Cher), making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She is one of the few artists to win three of the four major American entertainment awards (EGOT—Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony), and one of five actor-singers to have had a U.S. number-one single and won an acting Academy Award. Her breakthrough single, Sonny & Cher's \"I Got You Babe\", is a Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and was featured on \"Rolling Stone\"'s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list compiled in 2003. Her 1998 song \"Believe\" was voted the world's eighth favorite song in a poll conducted by BBC in 2003—the only American song to be named on the list. In 1988, she became the first performer to receive an Academy Award for acting and a RIAA-certified gold album in the same year since the inception of gold awards in 1958.\n\nCher is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a \"Billboard\" chart in six consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2010s.

{"id": "279605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279605", "title": "Corazon Aquino", "text": "Corazon Aquino\n\nMaria Corazon \"Cory\" Cojuangco Aquino (January 25, 1933 – August 1, 2009) was a Filipino politician who served as the 11th President of the Philippines, becoming the first woman to hold that office. The first female president in the Philippines, Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution, which toppled the 21-year rule of President Ferdinand Marcos. She was named \"Time\" magazine's Woman of the Year in 1986. Prior to this, she had not held any other elective office. \n\nA self-proclaimed \"plain housewife\", she was married to Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., the staunchest critic of President Marcos. She emerged as leader of the opposition after her husband was assassinated on August 21, 1983 upon returning to the Philippines from exile in the United States. In late 1985, Marcos called for snap elections, and Aquino ran for president with former senator Salvador Laurel as her Vice President. After the elections were held on February 7, 1986, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate, Arturo Tolentino, as the winners amid allegations of electoral fraud, with Aquino calling for massive civil disobedience actions. Defections from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the support of the local Catholic hierarchy led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession on February 25, 1986.\n\nAs President, Aquino oversaw the promulgation of the 1987 Constitution, which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the bicameral Congress. Her administration gave strong emphasis and concern for civil liberties and human rights, and on peace talks to resolve the ongoing Communist insurgency and Islamist secession movements. Her economic policies centered on restoring economic health and confidence and focused on creating a market-oriented and socially responsible economy. She became the first Filipino to be bestowed with the prestigious Prize For Freedom Award in 1987.\n\nAquino faced several coup attempts against her government and various natural calamities until the end of her term in 1992. She was succeeded as President by Fidel Ramos, and returned to civilian life while remaining public about her opinions on political issues. In recognition for her role in the world's most peaceful revolution to attain democracy, she was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1998.\n\nIn 2008, Aquino was diagnosed with colorectal cancer and died on August 1, 2009. Her monuments of peace and democracy were established in the capital Manila and her home province of Tarlac after her death. Her son Benigno Aquino III became President of the Philippines from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2016. Throughout her life, Aquino was known to be a devout Roman Catholic, and was fluent in French, Japanese, Spanish, and English aside from her native Tagalog and Kapampangan.\n\nAquino was born Maria Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco on January 25, 1933 in Paniqui, Tarlac, and was the sixth (of whom two died in infancy) of eight children of José Cojuangco, a former congressman, and Demetria Sumulong, a pharmacist. Her siblings were Pedro, Josephine, Teresita, Jose Jr. and Maria Paz. Both Aquino's parents came from prominent clans. Her father was a prominent Tarlac businessman and politician, and her grandfather, Melecio Cojuangco, was a member of the historic Malolos Congress. Her mother belonged to the Sumulong family of Rizal province who were also politically influential; Juan Sumulong, a prominent member of the clan, ran against Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon in 1941.\n\nAs a young girl, Aquino spent her elementary school days at St. Scholastica's College in Manila, where she graduated on top of her class as valedictorian. She transferred to Assumption Convent to pursue high school studies. Afterwards, she and her family went to the United States and attended the Assumption-run Ravenhill Academy in Philadelphia. In 1949, she graduated from Notre Dame Convent School in New York. She then pursued her college education in the U.S. graduating from the College of Mount Saint Vincent in 1953 in New York, with a major in French and minor in mathematics. During her stay in the United States, Aquino volunteered for the campaign of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey against then Democratic U.S. President Harry S. Truman during the 1948 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nAfter graduating from college, she returned to the Philippines and studied law at Far Eastern University in 1953. She later met Benigno \"Ninoy\" S. Aquino Jr.—son of the late Speaker Benigno S. Aquino Sr. and a grandson of General Servillano Aquino. She discontinued her law education and married Ninoy in Our Lady of Sorrows church in Pasay on October 11, 1954. The couple raised five children: Maria Elena (\"Ballsy\"; born 1954), Aurora Corazon (\"Pinky\"; born 1957), Benigno Simeon III (\"Noynoy\"; born 1960), Victoria Elisa (\"Viel\"; born 1961) and Kristina Bernadette (\"Kris\"; born 1971).\n\nAquino had initially had difficulty adjusting to provincial life when she and her husband moved to Concepcion, Tarlac in 1955. Aquino found herself bored in Concepcion, and welcomed the opportunity to have dinner with her husband inside the American military facility at nearby Clark Field.\n\nUnknown to many, she voluntarily sold some of her prized inheritance to fund the candidacy of her husband. She led a modest existence in a bungalow in suburban Quezon City. A member of the Liberal Party, Aquino's husband Ninoy rose to become the youngest governor in the country and eventually became the youngest senator ever elected to the Senate of the Philippines in 1967. During her husband's political career, Aquino remained a housewife who helped raise their children and played hostess to her spouse's political allies who would frequent their Quezon City home. She would decline to join her husband on stage during campaign rallies, preferring instead to stand at the back of the audience and listen to him.\n\nNinoy Aquino soon emerged as a leading critic of the government of President Ferdinand Marcos. He was then touted as a strong candidate for president to succeed Marcos in the 1973 elections. However, Marcos, being barred by the Constitution to seek a third term, declared martial law on September 21, 1972, and later abolished the existing 1935 Constitution, thereby allowing him to remain in office. As a consequence, her husband was among those to be first arrested at the onset of martial law, later being sentenced to death. During his incarceration, Ninoy sought strength from prayer, attending daily Mass and saying the rosary three times a day. As a measure of sacrifice and solidarity with her husband and all other political prisoners, she enjoined her children from attending parties and she also stopped going to the beauty salon or buying new clothes until a priest advised her and her children to instead live as normal lives as possible.\n\nIn 1978, despite her initial opposition, Aquino decided to run in the 1978 Batasang Pambansa elections. A reluctant speaker, Corazon Aquino campaigned on behalf of her husband, and for the first time in her life delivered a political speech. In 1980, upon the intervention of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Marcos allowed Senator Aquino and his family to leave for exile in the United States, where he sought medical treatment. The family settled in Boston, and Aquino would later call the next three years as the happiest days of her marriage and family life. On August 21, 1983, however, Ninoy ended his stay in the United States and returned without his family to the Philippines, only to be assassinated on a staircase leading to the tarmac of the Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport or NAIA), which was later renamed in his honor (see Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.). Corazon Aquino returned to the Philippines a few days later and led her husband's funeral procession, in which more than two million people participated.\n\nFollowing her husband's assassination in 1983, Aquino became active and visible in various demonstrations and protests held against the Marcos regime. She began to assume the mantle of leadership left by her husband Ninoy and started to become the symbolic figurehead of the anti-Marcos political opposition. In the last week of November 1985, Marcos surprised the nation by announcing on American television that he would hold a snap presidential election in February 1986, in order to dispel and remove doubts against his regime's legitimacy and authority.\n\nInitially reluctant, Aquino was eventually prevailed upon to heed the people's clamor, after one million signatures urging her to run for president were presented to her. Despite this, United Opposition (UNIDO) leader Laurel, did not immediately give way to his close friend's widow. Salvador Laurel only gave way to Cory after a political deal which was later reneged by Cory after the election. According to Salvador Laurel's diary, Cory offered Laurel that he would be her Prime Minister, that she would step down in two years, that Laurel would name 30 percent of the Cabinet, that she would appoint the remaining 70 percent after close consultations with Laurel. Salvador Laurel eventually ran as Cory Aquino's running mate for vice-president under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party. With that, the Aquino-Laurel tandem was formally launched to challenge Marcos and finally put an end to his two-decade rule.\n\nIn the subsequent political developments and events, given Ninoy's links with the Communist, Marcos charged that Aquino was being supported by communists and agreed to share power with them once elected into power. A political novice, Aquino categorically denied Marcos' charge and even stated that she would not appoint a single communist to her cabinet. Running on the offensive, the ailing Marcos also accused Aquino of playing \"political football\" with the United States with respect to the continued United States military presence in the Philippines at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base. Furthermore, the male strongman derided Aquino's womanhood, by saying that she was \"just a woman\" whose place was in the bedroom. In response to her opponent's sexist remark, and in reference to the fact that the ailing and feeble Marcos was increasingly seen as being largely a front man for his wife, Imelda, Aquino simply remarked that \"may the better woman win in this election\". Marcos also attacked Aquino's inexperience and warned the country that it would be a disaster if a woman like her with no previous political experience was to be elected president, to which Aquino cleverly and sarcastically responded, admitting that she had \"no experience in cheating, lying to the public, stealing government money, and killing political opponents\".\n\nThe snap election called by Marcos which was held on February 7, 1986, was marred by massive electoral fraud, violence, intimidation, coercion and disenfranchisement of voters. Election Day proved to be bloody as one of Aquino's staunchest allies, former Antique province Governor Evelio Javier, was brutally murdered, allegedly by some of Marcos' supporters in his province. Furthermore, during the counting and tallying of votes conducted by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), 30 poll computer technicians walked out to dispute and contest the alleged election-rigging being done in favor of Marcos. However, not known to many, the walkout of computer technicians was led by Linda Kapunan, wife of Lt Col Eduardo Kapunan, a leader of Reform the Armed Forces Movement, which plotted to attack the Malacañang Palace and kill Marcos and his family, leading some to believe that the walkout could have been planned with ulterior motives. Despite this, the Batasang Pamabansa, which was dominated by Marcos' ruling party and its allies, declared President Marcos as the winner on February 15, 1986. In protest to the declaration of the Philippine parliament, Aquino called for a rally dubbed \"Tagumpay ng Bayan\" (People's Victory Rally) the following day, during which she claimed that she was the real winner in the snap election and urged Filipinos to boycott the products and services by companies controlled or owned by Marcos' cronies. The rally held at the historic Rizal Park in Luneta, Manila drew a mammoth-sized crowd, which sent a strong signal that Filipinos were quite tired of Marcos' two decades of rule and the lengths to which he would go to perpetuate it. Further, the dubious election results drew sharp reactions from both local quarters and foreign countries. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) issued a statement strongly criticizing the conduct of the election which was characterized by violence and fraud. The United States Senate likewise condemned the election. Aquino rejected a power-sharing agreement proposed by the American diplomat Philip Habib, who had been sent as an emissary by U.S. President Ronald Reagan to help defuse the tension. On February 25, 1986 supporters of Aquino and Marcos celebrated the inauguration of their supported President. This was the same day that Ferdinand E. Marcos fled the country.\n\nOn February 22, 1986, disgruntled and reformist military officers led by then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel V. Ramos, surprised the entire nation and the international community when they announced their defection from the Marcos government, citing strong belief that Aquino was the real winner in the contested presidential elections. Enrile, Ramos, and the rebel soldiers then set up operations in Camp Aguinaldo, the headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and Camp Crame (headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary) across Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA). Cardinal Sin appealed to the public in a broadcast over Church-run Radio Veritas, and millions of Filipinos trooped to the part of Epifanio De los Santos Avenue between the two camps to give their support and prayers for the rebels.\n\nAt that time, Aquino was meditating in a Carmelite convent in Cebu, and upon learning of the defection, she urged people to rally behind Minister Enrile and General Ramos. Aquino flew back to Manila to prepare for the takeover of the government, and after three days of peaceful mass protests, was sworn in as the eleventh President of the Philippines on February 25, 1986.\n\nThe triumph of the peaceful People Power Revolution and the ascension of Corazon Aquino into power signaled the end of authoritarian rule in the Philippines and the dawning of a new era for Filipinos. The relatively peaceful manner by which Aquino came into power drew international acclaim and admiration not only for her but for the Filipino people, as well.\n\nShe was the first female president of the country and the only president with no political background. She is also regarded as the first female president in Asia. One of Aquino's first moves was the creation of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), which was tasked to go after the Marcos ill-gotten wealth.\n\nImmediately after assuming the presidency, President Aquino issued , which established a revolutionary government. She abolished the 1973 Constitution that was in force during Martial Law, and by decree issued the provisional 1986 Freedom Constitution pending the ratification of a more formal, comprehensive charter. This allowed her to exercise both executive and legislative powers until the ratification of the 1987 Constitution and the restoration of Congress in 1987.\n\nAquino promulgated two landmark legal codes, namely, the Family Code of 1987, which reformed the civil law on family relations, and the Administrative Code of 1987, which reorganized the structure of the executive branch of government. Another landmark law that was enacted during her tenure was the 1991 Local Government Code, which devolved national government powers to local government units (LGUs). The new Code enhanced the power of LGUs to enact local taxation measures and assured them of a share in the national revenue. Aquino closed down the Marcos-dominated Batasang Pambansa to prevent the new Marcos loyalist opposition from undermining her democratic reforms and reorganized the membership of the Supreme Court to restore its independence.\n\nIn May 1986, the reorganized Supreme Court declared the Aquino government as \"not merely a \"de facto\" government but in fact and law a \"de jure\" government\", whose legitimacy had been affirmed by the community of nations. This Supreme Court decision affirmed the status of Aquino as the rightful leader of the Philippines. To fast-track the restoration of a full constitutional government and the writing of a new charter, she appointed 48 members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission (\"Con-Com\"), led by retired activist Supreme Court Associate Justice Cecilia Muñoz-Palma. The Con-Com completed its final draft in October 1986. On February 2, 1987, the new Constitution of the Philippines, which put strong emphasis on civil liberties, human rights and social justice, was overwhelmingly approved by the Filipino people. The ratification of the new Constitution was followed by the election of senators and congress that same year and the holding of local elections in 1988.\n\nAs soon as she assumed the presidency of the Philippines, Aquino moved quickly to tackle the issue of the US$28 billion-foreign debt incurred by her predecessor, which has badly tarnished the international credit standing and economic reputation of the country. After weighing all possible options such as choosing not to pay, Aquino eventually chose to honor all the debts that were previously incurred in order to clear the country's image. Her decision proved to be unpopular but Aquino defended that it was the most practical move. It was crucial for the country at that time to regain the investors' confidence in the Philippine economy. Beginning in 1986, the Aquino administration paid off $4 billion of the country's outstanding debts to regain good international credit ratings and attract the attention of future markets. Although it borrowed an additional $9 billion, increasing the net national debt by $5 billion within six years after the ouster of former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, due to the need to infuse capital and money into the economy, the Aquino administration succeeded in wrangling lower interest rates and longer payment terms in settling the country's debts. From 87.9 percent when it inherited the foreign debt from the Marcos regime, the Cory Aquino administration was able to reduce by 30.1 percent the Philippines' external debt-to-GDP ratio to 67.8 percent in 1991.\n\nFurthermore, recognizing how crony capitalism weakened the economy due to collusion between government and big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of subsidiarity, President Aquino set out on a course of market liberalization agenda while at the same time emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.\n\nThe economy posted a positive growth of 3.4% during her first year in office. But in the aftermath of the 1989 coup attempt by the rightist Reform the Armed Forces Movement, international confidence in the Philippine economy was seriously damaged. During her presidency, Aquino made fighting inflation one of her priorities, after reeling from skyrocketing prices during the Martial Law years, in which at one point inflation reached 50.3 percent in 1984. Although inflation peaked at 18.1 percent during the 1991 Gulf War, which caused panic among Filipinos who have many family members working in the Middle East, inflation during Aquino's time averaged 9.6 percent from 1986 to 1992, which was way lower than the average 20.9 percent-inflation rate that was recorded during the last 6 years of the Marcos dictatorship. Overall, the economy under Aquino had an average growth of 3.8% from 1986 to 1992.\nSoon after taking office, Aquino declared that the presence of U.S. military forces in the Philippines was an affront to national sovereignty. She ordered the United States military to vacate U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay and Clark Air Base. The United States objected, pointing that they had leased the property and the leases were still in effect. Also, thousands of Filipinos worked at these military facilities and they would lose their jobs and the Filipino economy would suffer if the U.S. military moved out. The United States stated that the facilities at Subic Bay were unequaled anywhere in Southeast Asia and a U.S. pullout could make all of that region of the world vulnerable to an incursion by the Soviet Union or by a resurgent Japan. She refused to back down and insisted that the United States get out. The matter was still being debated when Mount Pinatubo erupted in June 1991, covering the entire area with volcanic ash. The destruction to the bases was so severe that the United States decided that it would best to pull out after all, so the bases were closed and the United States departed.\n\nPresident Aquino envisioned agrarian and land reform as the centerpiece of her administration's social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On February 22, 1987, three weeks after the resounding ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the Malacañan Palace to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, at least 12 were killed and 51 protesters were injured in this incident now known as the Mendiola Massacre. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts.\n\nIn response to calls for agrarian reform, President Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on July 22, 1987, which outlined her land reform program, which included sugar lands. In 1988, with the backing of Aquino, the new Congress of the Philippines passed Republic Act No. 6657, more popularly known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law\". The law paved the way for the redistribution of agricultural lands to tenant-farmers from landowners, who were paid in exchange by the government through just compensation but were also allowed to retain not more than five hectares of land. However, corporate landowners were also allowed under the law to \"voluntarily divest a proportion of their capital stock, equity or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries\", in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution. Despite the flaws in the law, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1989, declaring that the implementation of the comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP) provided by the said law, was \"a revolutionary kind of expropriation\".\n\nDespite the implementation of CARP, Aquino was not spared from the controversies that eventually centered on Hacienda Luisita, a 6,453-hectare estate located in the Province of Tarlac, which she, together with her siblings inherited from her father Jose Cojuangco (Don Pepe).\n\nCritics argued that Aquino bowed to pressure from relatives by allowing stock redistribution under Executive Order 229. Instead of land distribution, Hacienda Luisita reorganized itself into a corporation and distributed stock. As such, ownership of agricultural portions of the hacienda were transferred to the corporation, which in turn, gave its shares of stocks to farmers.\n\nThe arrangement remained in force until 2006, when the Department of Agrarian Reform revoked the stock distribution scheme adopted in Hacienda Luisita, and ordered instead the redistribution of a large portion of the property to the tenant-farmers. The Department stepped into the controversy when in 2004, violence erupted over the retrenchment of workers in the Hacienda, eventually leaving seven people dead.\n\nDuring her last two years in office, President Aquino's administration faced series of natural disasters and calamities. Among these were the 1990 Luzon earthquake, which left around 1,600 people dead and the 1991 volcanic eruption of what was then thought to be a dormant Mount Pinatubo, which was the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century, killing around 300 people and causing widespread long-term devastation of agricultural lands in Central Luzon. On November 1, 1991 Tropical Storm Thelma (also known as Typhoon Uring) caused massive flooding in Ormoc City, leaving around 5,000 dead in what was then considered to be the deadliest typhoon in Philippine history. On November 8, Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area. On December 20, 1987, the MV \"Doña Paz\" sank which \"Time\" and others have dubbed as \"the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster of the 20th century\", given the death toll which were initially estimated to be around 1,500 which later grew for at least 3,000, and finally exceeded about 4,300. Aquino described the aftermath as \"a national tragedy of harrowing proportions...[the Filipino people's] sadness is all the more painful because the tragedy struck with the approach of Christmas\".\n\nDuring Aquino's presidency, electric blackouts became common in Manila. The capital experienced blackouts lasting 7–12 hours, bringing numerous businesses to a halt. By the departure of Aquino in June 1992, businesses in Manila and nearby provinces had lost nearly $800 million since the preceding March.\n\nCorazon Aquino's decision to mothball the Bataan Nuclear Plant built during the Marcos administration contributed to the power crisis in the 1990s, as the 620 megawatts capacity of the plant was enough to cover the shortfall at that time.\n\nWhen 15 farmers staging a peaceful rally in Mendiola were gunned down by the military under Aquino on January 22, 1987 during the Mendiola Massacre, Jose Diokno, head of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights and chairman of the government panel in charge of negotiations with rebel forces resigned from his two government posts in deep disgust and great sadness. His daughter Maris said, \"It was the only time we saw him near tears.”\n\nIn September 1987, Vice President Doy Laurel resigned as Cory's Secretary of Foreign Affairs. In his letter to Cory, he said: \"the past years of Marcos are now beginning to look no worse than your first two years in office. And the reported controversies and scandals involving your closest relatives have become the object of our people’s outrage. From 16,500 NPA regular when Marcos fell, the communists now claim an armed strength of 25,200. From city to countryside, anarchy has spread. There is anarchy within the government, anarchy within the ruling coalesced parties, and anarchy in the streets.\"\n\nCorazon Aquino's Finance Minister, Jaime Ongpin, who successfully advocated against not paying debt incurred during Marcos' administration, was later dismissed by Cory Aquino and later died in an apparent suicide in December 1987 after \"he had been depressed about infighting in Aquino's cabinet and disappointed that the 'People Power' uprising which had toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos had not brought significant change\".\n\nIn part due to Marcos' excesses, the framers of the 1987 Constitution limited the president to a single six-year term, with no possibility of re-election. As the end of her presidency drew near, close advisers and friends told Aquino that since she was not inaugurated under the 1987 Constitution, she was still eligible to seek the presidency again in the upcoming 1992 elections, the first presidential elections held under normal and peaceful circumstances since 1965. However, Aquino strongly declined the requests for her to seek reelection and wanted to set an example to both citizens and politicians that the presidency was not a lifetime position.\n\nInitially, she named Ramon V. Mitra, a friend of her husband Ninoy and then Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, as her candidate for the presidential race in 1992. However, she later on backtracked and instead threw her support behind the candidacy of her defense secretary and EDSA Revolution hero, General Fidel V. Ramos, who constantly stood by and defended her government from the various coup attempts and rebellions that were launched against her. Her sudden change of mind and withdrawal of support from Mitra drew criticism not only from her supporters in the liberal and social democratic sectors but also from the Roman Catholic Church, which questioned her anointing of Ramos since the latter was a Protestant. Nevertheless, Aquino's candidate eventually won the 1992 elections, albeit with only 23.58% of the total votes in a wide-open campaign, and was sworn in as the 12th President of the Philippines on June 30, 1992.\n\nOn June 30, 1992, President Aquino formally and peacefully handed over power to Ramos, after six years of hard-fought democratic transition and restoration. After the inauguration of the new President, Aquino chose to leave by riding in a simple white Toyota Crown she had purchased, rather than the lavish government-issued Mercedes Benz which she and Ramos had ridden in on the way to the ceremonies, to make the point that she was once again an ordinary citizen.\n\nAfter Aquino retired to private life following the end of her term she remained active in the Philippine political scene, constantly voicing opposition and dissent to government actions and policies, which she deemed as threats to the liberal traditions and democratic foundations of the country. In 1997, Aquino, together with Cardinal Jaime Sin, led a huge rally which succeeded in thwarting then President Fidel Ramos' attempt to extend his term by amending the 1987 Constitution's restriction on presidential term limits. In 1998, Aquino endorsed the candidacy of former police general and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim for president. Lim, however, lost to then Vice-President Joseph Estrada, who won by a landslide. The following year, Aquino again with Cardinal Sin successfully opposed President Estrada's plan to amend the Constitution, which he said was intended to lift provisions that 'restrict' economic activities and investments; he denied that it was another ploy for him to extend his stay in office.\n\nIn 2000, Aquino joined the mounting calls for Estrada to resign from office, amid strong allegations of bribery charges and gambling kickbacks and a series of corruption scandals, which eventually led to his unsuccessful impeachment in December of that year. In her Preface to Frank-Jürgen Richter and Pamela Mar's book \"Asia's New Crisis\", she decries that the unique Asian way of doing business has given rise to much crony capitalism and opacity in Asia, including the Philippines. In January 2001, during the EDSA Revolution of 2001 which ousted Estrada, Aquino enthusiastically supported the ascendancy of another woman, then Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, to power.\n\nIn 2005, after a series of revelations and exposes alleged and implicated President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in rigging the 2004 presidential elections, Aquino called on Macapagal-Arroyo to resign in order to prevent bloodshed, violence and further political deterioration. Aquino was once again in the streets leading massive demonstrations demanding the resignation of President Arroyo.\n\nIn the 2007 senatorial elections, Aquino actively campaigned for the senatorial bid of her only son, Noynoy Aquino, who ran successfully. In December 2008, Corazon Aquino publicly expressed regret for her participation in the EDSA Revolution of 2001, which installed Arroyo into power. She apologized to former President Joseph Estrada for the role she played in his ouster in 2001. For this action, many politicians criticized Aquino. In June 2009, two months before her death, Aquino issued a public statement which strongly denounced and condemned the Arroyo administration's plan of amending the 1987 Constitution, calling such attempt as a \"shameless abuse of power.\"\n\nShortly after leaving the presidency, Aquino traveled abroad, giving speeches and lectures on issues of democracy, development, human rights and women empowerment. In 1997, Aquino attended the wake and funeral of Saint Mother Teresa of Calcutta, whom she met during the latter's visit in Manila in 1989. In the 2000s (decade), Aquino joined various global leaders and democratic icons in urging the Government of Burma to unconditionally release Burmese democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi from detention, whom she delivered a speech on behalf in the 1994 meeting of the UNESCO World Commission on Culture and Development in Manila. In 2005, Aquino joined the international community in mourning the death of Pope John Paul II.\n\nAside from being visible in various political gatherings and demonstrations, Aquino was heavily involved in several charitable activities and socio-economic initiatives. From 1992 until her death, Aquino was chairperson of the Benigno S. Aquino, Jr. Foundation which she set up in her husband's honor right after his brutal assassination in 1983. Further, she supported other causes such as the Gawad Kalinga social housing project for the poor and homeless. In 2007, Aquino helped establish the PinoyME Foundation, a non-profit organization which aims to provide microfinancing programs and projects for the poor. She was also a lifelong member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international organization of former and current female heads of state and government. She also studied painting, and would occasionally give away her paintings to friends and family. In some events, Aquino auctioned her painting and gave all of the money to charity. She never sold her art for her own profit.\n\nOn March 24, 2008, Aquino's family announced that the former President had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Upon her being earlier informed by her doctors that she had only three months to live, she pursued medical treatment and chemotherapy. A series of healing Masses for Aquino (a devout Catholic) were held throughout the country intended for her recovery. In a public statement during one healing Mass on May 13, 2008, Aquino said that her blood tests indicated that she was responding well to treatment; her hair and appetite loss were apparent.\n\nBy July 2009, Aquino was reported to be in very serious condition, suffering from loss of appetite, and was confined to the Makati Medical Center. It was later announced that Aquino and her family had decided to stop chemotherapy and other medical interventions for her.\n\nAquino died in the Makati Medical Center at 3:18 a.m. on August 1, 2009 due to cardiorespiratory arrest at the age of 76.\n\nUpon learning of Aquino's death, then incumbent President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was then on a state visit to the United States, announced a 10-day mourning period for the former President and issued Administrative Order No. 269 detailing the necessary arrangements for a state funeral. Aquino's children, however, declined the government's offer of a state funeral for their mother.\n\nAll churches in the Philippines celebrated requiem masses simultaneously throughout the country and all government offices flew the Philippine flag at half mast. Hours after her death, Aquino's body lay in repose for public viewing at the La Salle Green Hills campus in Mandaluyong City. On August 3, 2009, Aquino's body was transferred from La Salle Greenhills to Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, during which hundreds of thousands of Filipinos lined the streets to view and escort the former leader's body. On the way to the Cathedral, Aquino's funeral cortege passed along Ayala Avenue in Makati, stopping in front of the monument to her husband Ninoy, where throngs of mourners gathered and sang the patriotic protest anthem \"\"Bayan Ko\". Aquino's casket was solemnly brought inside the Cathedral by mid-afternoon that day. Following her death, all Roman Catholic dioceses in the country held requiem Masses.\n\nOn August 4, 2009, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr., and Imee Marcos—children of the late former President Ferdinand Marcos—paid their last respects to Aquino despite the two families' fierce political rivalry; the Aquinos have been blaming the late dictator for the assassination of Ninoy Aquino Jr. in 1983. The Marcos siblings were received by Aquino's daughters María Elena, Aurora Corazon, and Victoria Elisa. Early the next day, President Arroyo, who had cut short her trip in the United States, briefly paid her last respects to her erstwhile ally President Aquino.\n\nA final requiem Mass was held on the morning of August 5, 2009, with then-Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, then-Bishop of Balanga Socrates B. Villegas, and other high-ranking clergymen concelebrating. Aquino's daughter Kris spoke on behalf of her family towards the end of the Mass. Aquino's flag-draped casket was escorted from the Cathedral to Manila Memorial Park in Parañaque, where she was interred beside her husband in the family mausoleum. Aquino's funeral procession took more than eight hours to reach the burial site, as tens of thousands of civilians lined the route to pay their respects. Philippine Air Force UH-1 helicopters showered the procession with yellow confetti and ships docked at Manila's harbour blared their sirens, all to salute the late President, .\n\nBoth local and international leaders showed respect for Aquino's achievements in the process of democratization in the Philippines.\n\nVarious politicians across the political spectrum expressed their grief and praise for the former Philippine leader. President Arroyo, once an ally of Aquino, remembered the sacrifices she made for the country and called her a \"national treasure.\" Former President Estrada said that the country had lost its mother and guiding voice with her sudden death. He also described Aquino as the \"Philippines' most loved woman.\" Although once bitter political foes, Aquino and Estrada reconciled and joined hands together in opposing President Arroyo.\n\nFormer Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, Aquino's defense minister and later fierce critic, asked the public to pray for her eternal repose. Although former Aquino interior minister and Senate Minority floor leader Aquilino Pimentel, Jr., revealed that he had \"mixed feelings\" about Aquino's death, he also said that the country \"shall be forever indebted to Cory for rallying the nation behind the campaign to topple dictatorial rule and restore democracy\".\n\nOrdinary Filipinos throughout the country wore either yellow shirts or held masses for Aquino as their way of paying tribute to the woman who once led them in a revolution that changed the course of their country's history. Yellow Ribbons, which were once used during Aquino's battle with Marcos, were tied along major national roads and streets as a sign of solidarity and support for the now deceased Aquino and her grieving family. In popular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, Filipinos posted yellow ribbons in their accounts as a tribute to the former Philippine leader. Following her death, Filipino Catholics called on the Church to have Aquino canonized and declared as a saint. During her lifetime, Aquino was known and praised for her strong spirituality and sincere devotion to the Catholic faith. Days after her funeral, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) announced that it supported calls to put the former President on the 500-Peso banknote alongside her husband, Ninoy Aquino.\n\nAcross the globe, messages of sympathy and solidarity with the Filipino people were sent by various heads of state and international leaders. Pope Benedict XVI, in his letter to Archbishop Rosales, recalled Aquino's \"courageous commitment to the freedom of the Filipino people, her firm rejection of violence and intolerance\" and called her a woman of courage and faith. U.S. President Barack Obama, through White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, said that \"her courage, determination, and moral leadership are an inspiration to us all and exemplify the best in the Filipino nation\". U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed sadness over the passing of Aquino, to whom she had sent a personal letter of best wishes for recovery while she was still in hospital in July 2009. Clinton said that Aquino was \"admired by the world for her extraordinary courage\" in leading the fight against dictatorship. Meanwhile, South Africa President Jacob Zuma called Aquino \"a great leader who set a shining example of peaceful transition to democracy in her country\".\n\nQueen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, through the British Ambassador in Manila, sent a message to the Filipino people which read: \"I am saddened to hear of the death of Corazon 'Cory' Aquino the former President of the Republic of the Philippines\". She also added, \"I send my sincere condolences to her family and to the people of the Philippines. Signed, Elizabeth R\".\n\nFurthermore, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, in a telegram to President Arroyo, said that \"the name of Corazon Aquino is associated with a period of profound reforms and the democratic transformation of Filipino society\". Medvedev also lauded Aquino's sympathy to Russian people and her contribution to the improvement of Russian-Filipino relations.\n\nMoreover, global democratic icons such as Timor-Leste President José Ramos-Horta and Wan Azizah, wife of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, came to the Philippines not just to express their sympathies but to attend their friend Aquino's death and funeral, as well.\n\nAfter her release from imprisonment for almost 20 years, Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's democratic opposition leader, publicly stated that Aquino is one of her inspirations as she continues to champion the cause of democracy in Myanmar. She has also expressed her good wishes for Aquino's son, then incumbent Philippine president Benigno S. Aquino III.\n\n\"Foreign Policy\" listed Corazon Aquino, along with Eleanor Roosevelt, Václav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and Sari Nusseibeh, as people who \"never won the Nobel Prize, but should have.\"\n\nAfter leaving the presidency, Aquino received several awards and citations. In 1994, Aquino was cited as one of \"100 Women Who Shaped World History\" in a reference book written by Gail Meyer Rolka and published by Bluewood Books in San Francisco, California. In 1996, she received the J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding from the Fulbright Association, joining past recipients such as Jimmy Carter and Nelson Mandela. In August 1999, Aquino was chosen by \"Time\" Magazine as one of the 20 Most Influential Asians of the 20th century. The same magazine cited her in November 2006 as one of 65 great Asian Heroes, along with Aung San Suu Kyi, Deng Xiaoping, Lee Kuan Yew, Mahatma Gandhi, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej.\nIn 2002, Aquino became the first woman named to the Board of Governors of the Board of the Asian Institute of Management, a leading graduate business school and think tank in the Asia Pacific region. She served on the Board until 2006.\n\nAquino was portrayed by Laurice Guillen in the 1988 HBO miniseries \"A Dangerous Life\". Aquino was a main character in Boy Noriega's 1987 stage comedy \"Bongbong at Kris\" (Bongbong and Kris), about an imagined romantic coupling between the only son of Ferdinand Marcos and the youngest daughter of the Aquinos. In the movie \"Alfredo Lim: Batas ng Maynila\", Aquino was portrayed by Filipino actress Luz Valdez. Aquino was portrayed by Tess Villarama in \"The Obet Pagdanganan Story\" (1997) and in \"Chavit\" (2003). She was also portrayed by Geraldine Malacaman in the 1998 musical play \"Lean\". In the defunct comedy gag show \"Ispup\", Madz Nicolas played a parodized version of Aquino who often reminisces about life with Ninoy. In 2004, Aquino was portrayed by Irma Adlawan in the miniseries \"Sa 'Yo Lamang\" (\"Only Yours\").\n\nIn 2008, a musical play about Aquino starring Isay Alvarez as Aquino, was staged at the Meralco Theater. Entitled \"Cory, the Musical\", it was written and directed by Nestor Torre and featured a libretto of 19 original songs composed by Lourdes Pimentel, wife of Senator Aquilino Pimentel. A two-part special of \"Maalaala Mo Kaya\" aired on January 23 and 30, 2010. Actors Bea Alonzo played Corazon Aquino and Piolo Pascual portrayed Ninoy Aquino also Jodi Sta. Maria portrayed daughter Kris Aquino.\n\nIn 2013, the exhibit, \"A Gift of Self\", was showcased in commemoration of Aquino's 4th death anniversary. The exhibit featured 30 of Aquino's paintings, all exuding her signature bold strokes and floral motifs which she based on her memory of the revolution and her love for haiku.\n\nPresident Corazon Aquino ended her term in 1992 with the country reeling under severe power shortage crisis. It was the offshoot of her administration's failure to provide replacement for the more than 600-MW of electricity foregone with the government's decision to mothball the Bataan nuclear power plant (BNPP).\n\nAs the guiding light of the People Power Revolution, Corazon Aquino is fondly remembered and deeply revered by most Filipinos as the \"mother of Philippine democracy\", and the \"housewife who led a revolution\". She has been hailed by American columnist Georgie Anne Geyer as a modern-day Joan of Arc.\n\nDespite the accolades she has received for assuming the mantle of leadership of the democratic struggle against the Marcos dictatorship, Aquino has always stated that it was actually the Filipino people, not her, who restored democracy in the Philippines and maintained that she was only an instrument.\n\nTo preserve and celebrate her legacy, various types of commemorations and memorials in honor of President Aquino were made. Among these are as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He joined the Labour League of Youth and later the Hull Branch of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, but was expelled from the latter in 1933 for his involvement in an internal dispute. He later joined the National Unemployed Workers' Movement.\n\nBillany received a degree in English from the University College of Hull in 1937. His career in teaching was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II; Billany joined the army in 1940 and became an officer as lieutenant in the 4th battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment. He was captured by the Germans and spent June 1942 through September 1943 as a prisoner of war in Italy.\n\nThroughout the war off duty, Billany concentrated on his writing. \"The Opera House Murders\", a thriller, and \"The Magic Door\", a book for boys, were published in 1940 and 1943, respectively. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Billany fled to the countryside with his manuscripts, working on them for weeks while hiding from the German army. He deposited them with a friendly local who promised to post them to Britain at the conclusion of the war. These manuscripts, \"The Cage\" and \"The Trap\", were received by Billany's family in 1946 and eventually published to wide acclaim. In \"Dockers and Detectives\", Ken Worpole lauded \"The Trap\" as \"the finest novel to come out of the war\".\n\nIn October 1943, Billany and three friends began to make their way over the Apennines towards the Allied forces. They were last seen in Capistrello on 20 November 1943, and presumably died in the mountains a few days later. Lieutenant Dan Billany is listed on the Commonwealth War Grave Commission's Cassino Memorial, to Commonwealth military personnel who have no known grave, as having died on 1 January 1944.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24695283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24695283", "title": "David Rainey", "text": "David Rainey\n\nDavid Edward \"Puck\" Rainey (born 1968) is an American reality television personality who first gained fame as a cast member on \"\" in 1994. A bicycle messenger during the show's shooting, he became notorious as the second \"Real World\" cast member ever to be evicted from the house, due to his increasingly antagonistic relationship with his housemates, most notably with Pedro Zamora, an HIV-positive AIDS educator. Rainey's conflict with Zamora is credited with helping make \"The Real World\" a hit show, for which \"Time\" ranked it #7 on their list of \"32 Epic Moments in Reality-TV History\". \"TV Guide\" included him in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.\n\nRainey was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has characterized his mother as a \"hippie\". He and his sister are of partial Swedish descent through their grandfather.\n\nRainey was a cast member on the MTV reality TV series \"\" in 1994. He and his castmates moved into the house at 953 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12 of that year. Among the cast, Rainey was an eccentric center of attention. In the season premiere he arrived at the house last because he was detained by police for a traffic incident. He incurred many minor injuries while bike riding, and kept photos of them, which he showed to his housemates. Although the producers informed the housemates that they would be living with someone who was HIV-positive, they did not reveal who it was, and as a result of these injuries, which included scabs on his face, some of the other castmates incorrectly assumed the HIV-positive cast member was Rainey. Rainey clashed with his roommates over his hygiene, as when Pedro Zamora complained that he used his finger to scoop peanut butter from a jar after he had used that finger to pick his nose. His roommate Mohammed Bilal complained Rainey tended to not change his socks, but instead covered his feet with more socks to mask the smell, which Bilal contended did not work. His housemates also complained of his lack of consideration for others, and his need to monopolize conversation. Rainey's housemate, Judd Winick, who is Jewish, was also offended at Rainey's wearing of a T-shirt that depicted four guns arranged in the shape of a swastika, and his refusal to accede to Winick's request not to wear the shirt (though this confrontation was only revealed in \"The Real World Diaries\", a book published by MTV, and depicted in the 2009 film \"Pedro\", not the series itself).\n\nOne of Rainey's closest relationships in the house was with Rachel Campos. Although their relationship became romantic when they kissed on three occasions, it eventually dissolved when, during a heated argument, he revealed this to the other housemates, despite having promised her he would not. Although the others were not surprised at this revelation, Campos saw this as a betrayal of trust.\n\nRainey's most contentious relationship was with Zamora. Rainey denigrated Zamora's career as an AIDS educator and mocked his Cuban accent. Winick described Rainey as \"obnoxious and homophobic.\" Zamora, who had AIDS himself, distanced himself from Rainey, and thereby from the other housemates, fearing the stress of his relationship with Rainey was affecting his health. When Zamora threatened to move out, the other housemates voted to evict Rainey instead. Rainey later appeared in subsequent episodes in which he encountered former housemates Cory Murphy, Campos, and Winick, but their meetings typically ended in conflict. In the season finale, he phoned Campos just before she left the house and accused his ex-roommates of harboring ill feelings towards him, calling them \"judases'\".\n\nDuring \"The Real World Reunion\" in 1995, which assembled the casts of the first four seasons of \"The Real World\", Rainey resumed his conflict with his former housemates, including Bilal and Winick, as well as cast members from other seasons. Following Winick's encouragement to the audience to get involved in fighting the AIDS epidemic, and his statement that Zamora's recent death made his decision to attend the reunion difficult, Rainey claimed that he too used his time to help AIDS patients. Winick countered by stating that Rainey had reacted to Zamora's death with the remark \"Good riddance\". Rainey denied this, and cast various aspersions on Winick and cast members present before temporarily leaving the taping.\n\nRainey made a cameo appearance in 1998 on \"\", Celebrity Death match, and competed in 2003 on \"\", during which he came into conflict with David Edwards of \"\", and married (on-camera) Betty Garcia, his fiancee and mother of his son, Bogart. He also made an appearance in Eminem's video for \"Without Me\".\n\nRainey appeared on the February 19, 2003 episode of \"MTV Cribs\".\n\nRainey had been cast to appear on the 2008 season of \"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew\", but left before filming began.\n\nRainey met his future wife, Betty, at a farmer's market in 1998. They had a son, and later married on \"\". They later had a second son, Rocco. In 2008, he, his wife and their two children were living in the Los Angeles area, where Rainey worked as a truck driver. By 2009, he and his family were living in Alabama, where Rainey made a living through public appearances and miscellaneous jobs. In his spare time he was gardening and modeling, though he prefers to model, whereas his partner works behind the camera. As of 2013 he had a third child with his wife. He lives on a farm in Neenach, California, raising chickens and vegetables, racing four-wheeled ATVs, and lives \"off the grid\".\n\nIn 2003, Rainey was arrested for domestic violence but the charges were dropped. In 2009, Rainey was sentenced to a year in a Los Angeles County jail after pleading no contest to charges of committing battery upon his girlfriend. That same year, he also pleaded no contest to felony possession of ammunition and was placed on 3 years’ probation.\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Rainey and his 8-year-old son were involved in a car accident on Route 79 in San Diego. His son bruised several internal organs, but was released from the hospital by March 24. Rainey, however, sustained fractures to both feet, right hand, neck, sternum and clavicle, and was expected to remain hospitalized for another week. The California Highway Patrol reported that Rainey was intoxicated at the time of the crash, and would be facing charges of DUI, child endangerment, and driving without a license. Rainey explained, \"I had two shots of Jack Daniels, but I ate a sandwich with it.\"\n\nOn June 19, 2011, Rainey was arrested on suspicion of felony corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant, and was held at Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail on $30,000 bail until his July 6 appearance in a San Fernando court.\n\nOn November 8, 2012, Rainey pleaded no contest to stalking an unidentified woman on February 22 of that year, and on November 8 was sentenced to two years in Wasco State Prison. Having received credit for 401 days already served, he was expected to be released in a little under a year.\n\nAs of 2013, Rainey was on felony probation and forbidden from leaving Los Angeles County, California.\n\n"}

He made several discoveries in thrombosis, haemostasis and vascular biology in many of which serendipity played a significant role. His main achievement has been his role in the development of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) from a laboratory concept to a life-saving drug for dissolving blood clots causing acute myocardial infarction or acute ischemic stroke. Recombinant t-PA was produced and marketed by Genentech Inc as Activase and by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH as Actilyse, and is considered biotechnology’s first life saving drug.\n\nIn 2008 Collen reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 years as Professor of the Faculty of Medicine at KU Leuven (Belgium), where he served as Director of the Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research (now Center for Molecular and Vascular Biology) and the VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy (now VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology). He authored and co-authored over 650 research papers in peer reviewed international journals which as of mid 2017 have been cited over 70,000 times. He was ranked among the 100 most cited scientific authors of the 1980s and among the top 100 living contributors to biotechnology in polls conducted by Reed Elsevier in 2005. In 2012 SciTech Strategies placed him among the top 400 most influential scientists in biomedical research for the period 1996-2011.\n\nIn 1988, Désiré Collen founded the ‘D. Collen Research Foundation vzw’, a not-for-profit organization with the mission to invest the mayor part of the royalties earned from Genentech on the t-PA patent in scientific research. The Foundation was renamed in 2007 into ‘Life Sciences Research Partners vzw’ of which Collen remains the Statutory Chairman.\n\nIn 1991 he spun out the company Thromb-X nv from the KU Leuven in Belgium. The primary focus of Thromb-X was in the cardiovascular space with an initial effort to develop staphylokinase as a more affordable thrombolytic medicine compared to t-PA (“poor man’s t-PA\"). With the constitution of ThromboGenics Ltd in Ireland in 1998, the company expanded its R&D scope to include cardiovascular, oncology and ophthalmology programs. ThromboGenics developed ocriplasmin, a truncated form of plasmin, for the treatment of vitreomacular traction in the eye. Disappointed by the, in his opinion inadequate strategic and commercial governance of the company, Collen left ThromboGenics as Chairman and board member in December 2013.\n\nWith the help of Chris Buyse , his CFO and “companion de route” during their 7 years at ThromboGenics, he co-financed the start of Fund, an ever-green investment fund that currently manages over 139 million euro . Fund is a private Fund for long term equity investment in innovative life sciences companies with a strong patient-centered approach aiming at both a financial return and a tangible societal impact.\n\nKing Albert II of Belgium awarded Désiré Collen hereditary nobility, with the personal rank of Baron in 2012. He was also recipient of the Belgian Francqui Prize, Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine, Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Cardiovascular Research, Interbrew-Baillet Latour Health Prize, Insead Innovator Prize, Robert P. Grant Medal of the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis , Lifetime Achievement Award of the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce (BelCham) , and Lifetime Achievement Award of Scrip. He received honorary doctorates from Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Free University of Brussels (VUB), Brussels, Belgium; University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, United States; and Université de la Méditerranée, Marseille, France.\n\nDésiré Collen, born on 21 June 1943 in the Flemish town of Sint-Truiden as the first of two children of Frans Collen and Maria Hoebrechs, started his studies in medicine at the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in 1961. Since his third year of the seven year curriculum he combined his studies with research: first in the laboratory of Belgian physiologist Professor Joseph P. Bouckaert, and from the next year on in the Laboratory for Blood Coagulation under the direction of Professor Marc Verstraete . Under the guidance of young gastroenterologist Guido Tytgat and biochemist René De Vreker he studied the rate at which the coagulation proteins fibrinogen and plasminogen are cleared from the circulation. This early experience with biochemical lab work inspired Désiré Collen to become a researcher rather than a practicing general physician or medical specialist. Realising his knowledge in chemistry was inadequate, he combined his education in medicine with academic studies in chemistry. He graduated from the KU Leuven as Doctor in Medicine in 1968 and as Master (“Licentiaat”) in Chemistry in 1969.\n\nMid 1968 Désiré Collen became research assistant of the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research in the Laboratory of Marc Verstraete. He worked simultaneously in the Department of Physical Chemistry under the supervision of Professor Leo De Maeyer . He started a research project on factors influencing the polymerization of fibrinogen to fibrin. Only months later, he published his first, although a very short one, scientific paper in Nature.\n\nIn 1971-1972 he went as an Associate Research Scientist of the National Institutes of Health (United States) to the New York University Medical Center to work with Alan Johnson. In 1972-1973 he worked in the laboratory of Birger Blombäck at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm (Sweden) as a NATO Research Fellow. After obtaining his Ph.D. in Chemistry at the KU Leuven in 1974 and concluding his mandatory military service, Désiré Collen was appointed in 1976 as Lecturer (Docent) in the Faculty of Medicine at KU Leuven and as Adjunct Head of Clinic in the Section Bleeding and Vascular Diseases in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital Leuven.\n\nThe scientific output of Désiré Collen between 1968 and 2008 consists of over 650 peer-reviewed research papers in international journals, 170 review articles and 28 issued US patents. His publications have been cited over 70,000 times in the scientific literature. He made seminal contributions to the fields of thrombosis, haemostasis and vascular biology. His pivotal achievement has been the development of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) from a laboratory concept to the first life saving biotech drug. Recombinant t-PA has been primarily used for dissolving blood clots causing acute myocardial infarction or acute ischemic stroke.\n\nT-PA is a protease that converts inactive plasminogen into active plasmin, which in turn cleaves fibrin, the main component of blood clots. Upon cleavage of the long fibrin strands by plasmin, the clot falls apart and dissolves. Between August 1977 and September 1978 Désiré Collen and Bjorn Wiman elucidated that the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin takes place when both proteins are bound to fibrin in the blood clot. This molecular model for the regulation and control of fibrinolysis was presented in 1979 during an invited plenary lecture (Edward Kowalski Memorial Lecture) at the VIIth International Congress on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in London. The written report of this presentation has been cited over 1000 times in the scientific literature.\n\nCollen collaborated in the same period with Professor Alfons Billiau of the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium on the inhibition of plasminogen activators secreted by malignant cells in culture, hypothesizing that synthetic inhibitors might suppress the malignant phenotype of these cells. In order to have a source for these “malignant plasminogen activators” the Bowes Melanoma Cell line was obtained from Professor Daniel Rifkin of the Rockefeller University, New York City at the end of 1978. It quickly appeared that this cell line produced large amounts of a plasminogen activator with a molecular weight of 70,000 dalton and a high affinity for fibrin, characteristic of human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), whereas most other malignant cells produced a plasminogen activator with a molecular weight of 54,000 dalton without affinity for fibrin, which is characteristic of pro-urokinase. This game-changing, although trivial serendipitous observation, made on 9 February 1979, was to change the course of thrombolytic therapy.\n\nIn order to produce sufficient amounts of t-PA for further biochemical and preclinical studies, post-doctoral fellow Dingeman (Dick) Rijken succeeded in isolating sufficient amounts of pure and homogeneous t-PA from conditioned culture medium from the Bowes Melanoma Cell line. This purified protein was used by post-doctoral fellow Osamu Matsuo to evaluate the thrombolytic potential of t-PA in rabbits suffering from an experimental pulmonary embolus. The research led to a key patent (US4752603) entitled ‘Plasminogen activator and pharmaceutical composition having thrombolytic activity’ which was first submitted in the Netherlands on 11 June 1980.\n\nOn 12 June 1980, one day after the submission of the patent application, Collen presented the results at the Fifth Congress on Fibrinolysis in Malmö (Sweden) in the presence of Diane Pennica , a young scientist from biotech company Genentech Inc, based in South San Francisco. Collen, KU Leuven and Genentech agreed to collaborate on the production of a recombinant version of t-PA (rt-PA), embarking on a new model for drug development: academic and biotech collaboration, today routine, but at that time a new modus operandi. Within 18 months, Pennica and her team had cloned the cDNA (complementary DNA) of human t-PA messenger RNA and was producing rt-PA in cultures of Chinese hamster ovary cells.\n\nThe therapeutic potential of rt-PA and its functional identity with natural t-PA was proven in a collaboration with Steven R. Bergman and Burton Sobel (Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis), Frans Van de Werf (KU Leuven), and Herman 'Chip' Gold and Tsunehori Yasuda (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston) using canine models of coronary thrombosis.\n\nAlso in 1981, following a discussion with Alfons Billiau at a scientific congress in Amsterdam, Dutch nephrologist Willem Weimar of the Dijkzigt Hospital in Rotterdam treated for the first time a patient with t-PA purified from the Bowes Melanoma Cell line. The patient, a 29 year old lady, was suffering from a renal transplant vein thrombosis and was successfully treated resulting in a decennia-long survival. Cardiologists Frans Van de Werf and Burton Sobel tested t-PA in 1983 in a pilot clinical study on patients with acute myocardial infarction. Also in 1983, the first prospective, randomized and placebo-controlled trial of recombinant t-PA took place in three US hospitals.\n\nThe subsequent NIH Thrombolysis in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials led by Eugene Braunwald (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard School of Medicine, Boston), and the European Cooperative Study Group Trials led by Marc Verstraete (KU Leuven) culminated in the final approval of rt-PA as thrombolytic agent by the FDA on 13 November 1987. Genentech immediately started to market the drug in the US under the brand name Activase®, while Boehringer Ingelheim would distribute the drug in the rest of the world (except Japan) as Actilyse®.\n\nThe controversy over whether the more expensive rt-PA was clinically superior over streptokinase as a thrombolytic agent climaxed in the scientific press between 1988 and 1992. To end this controversy, the GUSTO trial (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries) was set up, a head-to-head comparison between rt-PA and streptokinase. In the GUSTO-trial 41,021 heart attack patients were treated in 1,081 hospitals in 15 countries. Cardiologist Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic (USA), cardiologist/statistician Robert Califf of Duke University Medical Center (USA) and David Stump of Genentech coordinated the trial. In absolute figures the 30-day mortality rate in the rt-PA group was 1% lower (or in relative figures 14%) compared to the mortality in the streptokinase group. After the GUSTO studies, rt-PA became the thrombolytic drug of choice for most of the cardiologists in the Western world and would save the lives of many tens of thousands of heart attack patients.\n\nNowadays, cardiologists agree that timely performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as 'angioplasty’ and ‘stenting', is the preferred strategy to treat acute myocardial infarction instead of thrombolysis. PCI is associated with less mortality on the short term (7% versus 9% for thrombolysis), a lower risk of a recurrent infarct (3% versus 7%) and a lower frequency of cerebral hemorrhage (1% versus 2%). Also over a longer period of time, PCI leads to a lower mortality rate.\n\nHowever, because access to invasive facilities is limited in many countries, thrombolytic therapy is still employed in many centers worldwide for treating acute myocardial infarction. Moreover, rt-PA based thrombolysis still is an important strategy to treat ischemic stroke and to a lesser extent, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis; it has even been used to restore the blood flow in occluded central venous access ports and in the frozen limbs of mountaineers, resulting in a spectacular decrease in the amputation rate.\n\nOn many occasions Désiré Collen expressed his frustration that the lives of many more people could have been saved, had rt-PA been more readily available, also to people who were not living in the affluent western world. Therefore, he invested part of Genentech’s t-PA royalty stream in the search for a “t-PA for the poor”.\n\nIn the early 1990s, together with Roger Lijnen (KU Leuven) and Osamu Matsuo (Kindai University, Osaka, Japan), Collen started to evaluate whether staphylokinase (STAR), a bacterial profibrinolytic agent with high fibrin specificity, could be a valid alternative for rt-PA in less wealthy territories. By setting up spin off company Thromb-X, Collen had the clear objective to further develop staphylokinase through the preclinical and clinical research phases up to the market introduction. Although wild type staphylokinase and variants with reduced immunogenicity and preserved lytic potency have been tested with success in humans, its further development came to an unfortunate standstill because of the prohibitive expense of a GUSTO-like clinical trial with a mortality end-point that had become the standard in the West. Not even licensing out the further clinical development, production and commercialization of staphylokinase to companies in developing countries (where for most people rt-PA is hardly available) could save this project.\n\nWith the constitution of the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology (Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie - VIB), Collen was able to extend the capacity of his Leuven-based academic research laboratories. He became Director of the VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy (now VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology) based on the Gasthuisberg Campus of the KU Leuven. Together with Professor Peter Carmeliet and colleagues, landmark contributions were made to the fields of vascular biology, tumor biology and neurobiology, e.g. between 1995 and 2008 the Department conducted breakthrough research on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) in angiogenesis, cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nFrom 1981 to 2008 Désiré Collen was Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the KU Leuven in Belgium. Between 1998 and 2002 he temporarily resigned to develop ThromboGenics, but remained ‘Extraordinary Professor’ (Buitengewoon hoogleraar). In 2008 he reached the age of mandatory retirement at Belgian Universities.\n\nDésiré Collen was also Professor of Biochemistry and Medicine in the Department of Kenneth G. Mann at the University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont, USA (1984-2005), Visiting Professor of Medicine in the group of Herman 'Chip' Gold of Massachusetts General Hospital at Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA (1987-1994), Consultant in Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA (1987-2005) and Visiting Professor at the Division of Surgery and Anaesthesia of Kevin Burnand at United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London, UK (1999-2002).\n\nDésiré Collen was Director of the Center for Molecular and Vascular Biology at the Faculty of Medicine of the KU Leuven from 1994 to 2008, Division Head of the Protein Research Division of Leuven Research and Development vzw of the KU Leuven from 1976 to 1998 and Director of the Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy of the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) from 1994 to 2008.\n\nOn 2 July 1988 the D. Collen Research Foundation was constituted by Désiré Collen, Roger Dillemans , Rector of the KU Leuven, Karel Tavernier, General Manager of the KU Leuven, Jacques Vander Eecken, Chairman of Leuven Research and Development and Lawrence Fouraker, former Dean of the Harvard Business School representing the Harvard Medical School. The mission of the Foundation was to canalize the major part of the income from the rt-PA royalties towards “the execution, promotion and support of scientific research in general, and biomedical and biotechnological research in particular, by making available research grants, research positions, travel bursaries, by organizing scientific congresses and symposia, providing financial support for publications and all related activities that support the advancement of science.” With the support of the Foundation, over 100 young researchers were able to obtain further specialisation abroad; numerous congresses and symposia and two academic chairs were sponsored, the 9th floor of the research building on the Gasthuisberg Research Campus and a guesthouse on the Groot Begijnhof campus were built with financial support of the Foundation. These buildings housed for many years the Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research and the VIB Department for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy and their postdoctoral researchers, respectively.\n\nIn 2007 the D. Collen Research Foundation was renamed to Life Sciences Research Partners vzw . It continued the activities of the D. Collen Research Foundation, but also started to invest in life science companies, such as Celyad , Ogeda , Amakem, Bone Therapeutics and others.\n\nIn 1991, Désiré Collen spun out Thromb-X nv from the KU Leuven with an initial mission to develop staphylokinase as an equally effective but less expensive successor of rt-PA. With the foundation of ThromboGenics Ltd in Ireland in 1998, the Company expanded its R&D scope to include various cardiovascular, oncology and ophthalmology programs in-licensed from the KU Leuven and the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (Flemish Institute for Biotechnologie - VIB). Collen was CEO and Chairman of ThromboGenics from 1998 to 2008. In 2008 Patrick De Haes succeeded him as CEO.\n\nFollowing a successful IPO in 2006 on the basis of the expanded R&D portfolio, the company nevertheless narrowed its scope to the clinical development of ocriplasmin, a truncated form of plasmin for ophthalmology indications, culminating in the completion of a pivotal phase III program in 2010. Following FDA approval, ThromboGenics launched ocriplasmin, marketed as Jetrea®, in the US on 14 January 2013 for the treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMA). Three months later, the European Commission approved ocriplasmin, a decision that paved the way for Alcon to launch the product under licence of ThromboGenics. Disappointed by the, in his opinion, inadequate strategic and commercial governance of the company, Collen stepped down as Chairman and member of the board in December 2013.\n\nIn May 2015 Désiré Collen, through the private foundation Désiré Collen Stichting and the non-profit organisation Life Sciences Research Partners, founded Fund of which he is the Chairman. Fund will invest in innovative life sciences companies seeking series A or B financing and with a Proof of Concept in therapeutics, diagnostics or medical devices. The Fund made investments in Ogeda (acquired by Astellas), Iteos , MaSTherCell , Promethera , Q-Biologicals (acquired by Amatsi Group ), Novadip , eTheRNA and Octimet .\nFund aims at realizing an attractive financial return for its investors, as well as a societal return. Fund wants to contribute in a sustainable way to the improvement of the eco system for biotech companies. Therefore, its major geographical focus will be Belgium. \nAs of July 2017 Fund had raised over 139 Million euro of financing commitments. The intended investment size per company will be between 3 and 10 million euro spread over different milestones.\n\nDésiré Collen was awarded the Belgian Francqui Prize in Biological and Medical Sciences in 1984. He received the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine (Fondation L. Jeantet, Geneva, Switzerland) in 1986, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Cardiovascular Research (New York, NY, USA) jointly with Mark Verstraete in 1994, the Interbrew-Baillet Latour Health Prize (Belgium) jointly with Peter Carmeliet in 2005, the Harvard Leadership Prize by the Harvard Club of Belgium in 2007, the Insead Innovator Prize in 2009, the Robert P. Grant Medal from the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis in 2011, the Lifetime Achievement Award of Belcham (New York, NY, USA) in 2013 and the Lifetime Achievement Award of Scrip (London, UK) in 2013\n\nHe became Ereburger (Honorary Citizen) of his native town Sint-Truiden (Belgium) in 2013 and Alumnus of the Year 2014 of Alfagen KU Leuven. In 2012 his majesty King Albert II of Belgium awarded him the hereditary nobility status (personal title of Baron).\n\nIn addition he received honorary doctorates from Erasmus University, Rotterdam (The Netherlands) in 1988, Free University of Brussels (VUB), Brussels (Belgium) in 1994, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame (IN, USA) in 1995 and Université de la Méditerranée, Marseille (France) in 1999.\n\nCollen’s memoires (in Dutch) ‘Een hart voor onderzoek en ondernemen’ were published in 2009 by VandenBroele ().\n\n"}
{"id": "24919049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24919049", "title": "Edgar Ray Butterworth", "text": "Edgar Ray Butterworth\n\nEdgar Ray Butterworth (March 3, 1847 – January 1, 1921) was an American funeral director, believed to have coined the professional terms \"mortuary\" and \"mortician\".\n\nButterworth was born in 1847 in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts. His paternal grandfather, Noah Butterworth, served in the American Revolution. His father was William Ray Butterworth; his mother's name was Eliza \"née\" Norwood, also from an old New England family. In 1857 his family moved to Wright County, Minnesota, where his father worked as a millwright for six years. This was during the period of the Sioux Wars in that frontier region. When the American Civil War, broke out, Edgar Butterworth tried to enlist but he was too young. In 1863, the family returned to Massachusetts.\n\nFrom the age of 16—that is, roughly from the time of the family's return to Massachusetts—he was the prime breadwinner in his family. He worked for a time as a hatter; then, still in his teens and despite a limited formal education, he began to study law and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts just after he reached the age of 21. In 1869, he married Grace M. Whipple, a direct descendant of William Whipple, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. She died only two years into the marriage, after bearing a child, Gilbert M. Butterworth.\n\nIn 1873, Butterworth moved to Saint Louis, Missouri where he again worked as a hatter. Also in that year, he remarried to Maria L. Gillespie. They relocated to Fort Scott, Kansas and in 1876 to the rangelands of southwest Kansas, where he became a cattleman. He also hauled the bones of dead bison to the nearest railroad where he received US$10 per ton (907 kg).\n\nThere, on the plains of Kansas, he also had his first occasion to make a coffin. Traveling with his team and wagon, he encountered a settler in front of a \"dugout\" home, grieving for his wife and newborn child, both of whom had just died. With no lumber available on the grasslands, Butterworth fashioned a coffin from his own wagon box.\n\nIn 1881 the Butterworths moved farther west, to Washington, arriving in Chehalis in August of that year. He came with the intent of engaging in stock-raising, but that enterprise was not yet under way in Eastern Washington and Butterworth correctly gauged that Washington west of the Cascade Range was not cattle country. Instead, he built the first steam-powered flour mill west of the Cascades. The following spring the Butterworths relocated a short distance to Centerville, (later Centralia), where Butterworth set up a small furniture business. He served as a member of the first city council of Centralia and later as the city's mayor; he also served two terms was in the state legislature. When an epidemic of \"black diphtheria\" hit the region, Butterworth was called upon to make coffins, which is the point at which he effectively entered the undertaking business.\n\nInitially continuing in the furniture business, he also went into the business of selling coffins; he stocked a line of ready made coffins manufactured in Olympia, Washington. In 1892, by now a successful businessman, he relocated to Seattle, where he went into the undertaking business in a bigger way. He purchased a controlling interest in the Cross & Co. Undertakers located in the Masonic Temple that then stood on the northeast corner of Second Avenue and Pike street.\n\nThe business was soon renamed E. R. Butterworth & Sons. Five of his sons joined him in the business: the aforementioned Gilbert Butterworth and his half-brothers Charles Norwood Butterworth, Frederick Ray Butterworth, Harry Edgar Butterworth, and Benjamin Kent Butterworth. Gilbert and Frederick would be the longest-lived, and were followed into the business by several of their own sons. By 1929, when Butterworth's son Gilbert was managing the business, it had already remained in the hands of a single family longer than any other Seattle funerary business. It would retain that status nearly until the family sold the business to New Orleans-based Stewart Enterprises in 1998, by which time it was one of the city's longest-running family-owned business of any type. The last Butterworth to run the business—which was by then Butterworth-Manning-Ashmore, after a series of mergers—was Edgar's great-great grandson, Bert Butterworth Jr.\n\nFrom Second and Pike, the business moved to 1425 Second Avenue (later the 1896–1929 location of The Bon Marché department store); then to 1426-28 Third Avenue; and on October 1, 1903, to the custom built Butterworth Block at 1921 First Avenue. 1921 First Avenue now falls within the Pike Place Market Historic District, although the market was not founded until 1907. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since May 14, 1971.\n\nThe Butterworth Block or Butterworth Building was the city's first custom-built modern mortuary. Jeannie Yandel in 2009 described it as \"The city's first place for comprehensive death-related services from corpse retrieval to coffin sales.\" The building had the first elevator on the West Coast of the United States, used to transport bodies. A 2008 \"Seattle Times\" article describes the building, still extant, as \"[b]eautifully appointed in stained mahogany, art glass, ornamental plaster and specially designed brass and bronze hardware…\" The basement, accessible through Post Alley at the rear, is now (as of 2009) home to Kells Irish Restaurant & Pub.\n\nIn 1923, the business moved again, to a building on the northeast corner of Melrose Avenue and Pine Street, also extant as of 2009. Clarence Bagley, writing in 1929, described the building as having a crematory and columbarium, fireproof receiving vaults, a funeral church and chapel, and drawing rooms, and utilizing \"Cadillac motor equipment with special designed bodies\" as their hearses, stocking \"funeral furnishings… from the most simple to the magnificent.\" The former chapel of the Melrose mortuary now houses the bar The Pine Box. Whereas few traces 1921 First Avenue's original use remain at Kells, The Pine Box retains \"leaded glass windows and enormous mirrors, ornate dark woodwork, vaulted ceiling, antique fixtures\" and the original wood salvaged from the basement to build the bar top and tables.\n\nAlthough the family is no longer in the business, the name lives on in the Butterworth-Arthur Wright Chapel at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery on Queen Anne Hill.\n\nButterworth was a pioneer of the modern approach to the business of undertaking. Clarence Bagley credits him as the likely coiner of the terms\"mortuary\" and \"mortician\". He owned the first hearse north of the Columbia River. During Butterworth's lifetime, his business annually forgave the debts of customers who were not able to pay. Butterworth & Sons were also early adopters of the embalming techniques that now distinguish American funerary traditions from those more common in Western Europe.\n\nHe was a member of numerous fraternal organizations. He helped organize the Seattle lodges of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Ancient Order of United Workmen, and was also a member of the Knights of Pythias, the Independent Order of Foresters, the Woodmen of the World, the Royal Arcanum and the Independent Order of Good Templars, as well as being a charter member of the Alaskan Brotherhood Association, and a life member Seattle's Arctic Club. He was an active member of Temple Baptist Church, but also a practicing spiritualist.\n\nInevitably, not all of the corpses handled by Butterworth had died peacefully. During the years of the Yukon Gold Rush (which began in 1897), parts of Seattle were dangerous and violent. Undertakers were paid $50 per body to take dead bodies off the street; Butterworth & Sons partook of that business. Butterworth, the city's leading undertaking business of the period, also handled many victims of the Spanish flu pandemic. Later, when health faddist doctor Linda Burfield Hazzard was convicted over one of the several patients she starved to death, Butterworth & Sons were implicated in the scandal, because they had cremated one of her victims, then produced a different, less emaciated body for the funeral. The mortuary was not convicted of any wrongdoing, but Hazzard went to prison.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "27754385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27754385", "title": "Hu Songshan", "text": "Hu Songshan\n\nHu Songshan (1880–1955), a Hui, was born in 1880, in Tongxin County, Ningxia, China. His Muslim name in Arabic was Sa'd al-Din ( \"\"; ). Although he was born Sufi and turned Wahhabi, he changed his views and turned his back on Wahhabism after a Hajj to Mecca and later became an important imam, scripturalist, and leader of the Yihewani Muslim sect in China. He was influential and played an important role in Chinese Islam in this position as he propagated reformist doctrines in Ningxia in his later life. Hu also played a role in rallying Muslims against the Japanese invasion of China.\n\nHu's father was a Gansu \"ahong\" (imam) belonging to the Khafiya \"menhuan\", a Chinese-style Naqshbandi Sufi order. When Hu Songshan was 18, he joined Wang Naibi of Haicheng. At age 21, he became imam of the anti-Sufi Yihewani (Ikhwan in Arabic) sect, which was founded by the Wahhabi Ma Wanfu. Hu opposed wasteful rituals and cash payments for religious services, which Sufi orders practiced. Being a member of the Yihewani, he was so against Sufism and the \"menhuan\" to the point where he destroyed his own father's gongbei (a Hui Islamic shrine centered around a Sufi master's grave) built at Tongxin.\nHe went on Hajj to Mecca in 1924 at age 45, traveling through Shanghai and he reached Mecca in 1925. When Hu was in Mecca, he did not feel solidarity with other Muslims, he was treated racistly on hajj because he was from China, so he became a Chinese nationalist working to build a strong China, and abandoned salafism. Instead of advocating an Islamic state, he wanted Muslims to practice their religion in a strong China. He saw that Hui and Han people were treated the same and abused by foreigners. He rallied against foreign Imperialism and preached Chinese nationalism and unity between all Chinese. In Wuzhong County, Ningxia, Hu was the principal of an Arabic school. Hu Songshan had changed from being a Wahhabi Salafi to a modernist and influenced the Yihewani to change its ideology along that trend. One of his followers was Muhammad Ma Jian. Another one of his followers was the Yihewani Imam Ma Fulong (d. 1970). Hu became a prominent reformist and modernist Imam and Muhammad Ma Jian studied alongside him in 1928.\n\nHu encouraged unity and cooperation both between Muslims in China, and between non-Muslims and Muslims in China too, using Chinese classics to advance Chinese nationalism. He studied modern science, promoted sports for his students, and permitted people to take pictures of his mosque and him, which made him stand out from less-liberal Yihewani. Hu promoted reform of traditional Islamic education as his views while a follower of the Yihewani changed.\n\nHu Songshan and the Hui Muslim warlord of Ningxia, General Ma Hongkui cooperated in founding several Sino-Arabic schools (中阿學校) in Ningxia to promote Chinese and Arabic language Islamic education for Chinese Muslims in the 1930s and 1940s. Hu Songshan became head of the Ningxia Private Sino- Arabic College at Dongdasi Mosque, which was founded by Ma Hongkui in Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia province 1932. Students flocked to it from province across China after it became a public institution in the following year. Ten days prior to Ramadan's end in 1935, Ma Hongkui arranged for Chinese New Year celebrations. Hu Songshan pronounced kufr upon Ma Hongkui for this, while delivering an aggressive and fierce sermon in public. Ma Hongkui then sacked Hu from his position and exiled him. Hu then received clemency from Ma and was sent to head the Sino-Arabic Normal School in Wuzhong in 1938.\n\nWhen Japan invaded China in 1937 during the Second Sino Japanese War, Hu Songshan ordered that the Chinese Flag be saluted during morning prayer, . A prayer was written by him in Arabic and Chinese which prayed for the defeat of the Japanese and support of the Chinese government. The Quran was used to justify struggling against the Japanese. Hu Songshan helped spread anti-Japanese propaganda among Muslims during the war. Unlike his teacher Ma Wanfu, a strict Wahhabi scripturalist who led the Yihewani with an anti modernist and anti Chinese culture and language ideology, Hu Songshan encouraged Muslims to study Chinese language and learn about modern sciences and education in Chinese.\n\nImams such as Hu Songshan led the Chinese Muslim Brotherhood (the Yihewani) to incorporate Chinese nationalism and emphasize education and independence.\n\nThe Ma clique Muslim generals Ma Fuxiang and Ma Bufang gave support to Hu Songshan.\n\nHu added subjects such as Chinese language and other modern subjects such as foreign sciences, mathematics and foreign languages to the Islamic curriculum and he translated Islamic texts into Chinese. Hu was close to the Kuomintang Muslim General and governor of Ningxia, Ma Hongkui, and cooperated with him. All imams in Ningxia were required to preach Chinese nationalism during prayer at the mosque during the war with Japan. Hu was active in promoting this curriculum at Sino-Arabic schools in Ningxia. Hu often reminded the Muslim masses that \"If we object to natural science, then clothing, food, and shelter could not be talked about.\", whenever someone challenged his introduction of modern subjects such as mathematics and science to the Islamic curriculum.\n\nHu also cited a Hadith(), a saying of the prophet Muhammad, which says \"Loving the Motherland is equivalent to loving the Faith\" () ( \"\"). Hu Songshan harshly criticized those who were non patriotic and those who taught anti nationalist thinking, saying that they were fake Muslims.\n\nTraditional\n祈禱詞的內容如下：真主啊！求您援助我們的政府，使我們的國家永存，使我們的抗戰勝利，消滅我們的敵人。求您保佑我們免遭敵人侵略和殘殺的暴行。求您差遣狂風，使他們的飛機墜落，軍艦葬身大海，士兵厭戰，使他們的經濟崩潰，求您降天災懲罰他們！真主啊！求您賞准我們的祈禱！就這樣吧！\nSimplified\n祈祷词的内容如下：真主啊！求您援助我们的政府，使我们的国家永存，使我们的抗战胜利，消灭我们的敌人。求您保佑我们免遭敌人侵略和残杀的暴行。求您差遣狂风，使他们的飞机坠落，军舰葬身大海，士兵厌战，使他们的经济崩溃，求您降天灾惩罚他们！真主啊！求您赏准我们的祈祷！就这样吧！\nPinyin\nqídǎo cí de nèiróng rúxià ： Zhēnzhǔ ā！qiú nín yuánzhù wǒmen de zhèngfǔ , shǐ wǒmen de guójiā yǒngcún，shǐ wǒmen de kàngzhàn shènglì，xiāomiè wǒmen de dírén。qiú nín bǎoyòu wǒmen miǎnzāo dírén qīnlüè hé cánshā de bàoxíng。qiú nín chāiqiǎn kuángfēng，shǐ tāmen de fēijī zhuìluò，jūnjiàn zàng shēn dàhǎi，shìbīng yàn zhàn，shǐ tāmen de jīngjì bēngkuì，qiú nín jiàng tiānzāi chéngfá tāmen！Zhēnzhǔ ā！qiú nín shǎng zhǔn wǒmen de qídǎo！Jiù zhèyàng ba！\nArabic\n\nPrayer reads as follows: Oh God!

Lipman from page 200 of \"Familiar Strangers: A History of Muslims in Northwest China\"\n\nHu Songshan's son was Akhund Hu Xueliang (1918 – 1960), who was involved in a famous incident where a Muslim woman wanted a divorce in order to remarry since she waited for a decade when her husband vanished, while divorce is allowed after 4 years in the Maliki madhhab, divorce is only allowed after 90 years in the Hanafi Madhhab, which is the dominant Madhhab practiced in China, and a large amount of Chinese Muslims adhere strictly to the Hanafi Madhhab and view all other Madhhab as illegitimate so when Hu Xueliang decided to consult Maliki Madhhab rules and allow the woman to divorce, a violent disturbance broke out against Hu Xueliang so Hu had to be guarded from attacks from other Muslims by the Chinese army. Hu Xueliang had a son Hu Xibo.\n\nShaykh Sa'd al-Din Hu Songshan's grandson is Professor Shaykh Ibrahim Hu Long.\n\n"}

Jeanne may have done this to protect her underage children.\n\nThe union was short lived as relatives of the Ducal family in particular from the de Blois faction, laid a complaint with the bishops of Vannes and Rennes to protect their heritage and an investigation was conducted on February 10, 1330, resulting in the marriage being annulled by Pope John XXII in 1330. Guy then married into the de Blois faction to Maire de Blois who was also a niece of Phillip VI of France. Guy however unexpectedly died on the 26th March 1331 and his heritage passed to his daughter Jeanne of Penthièvre.\n\nIn 1330, Jeanne remarried to Olivier de Clisson IV, a wealthy Breton, holding a castle at Clisson, a manor house in Nantes and lands at Blain. Olivier was initially married to Blanche de Bouville (died 1329).\n\nJeanne a recent widow herself of the lord of Chateaubriant controlled areas in Poitou just south of the Breton border from Beauvoir-sur-Mer in the west to Cheaumur in the southeast of Clisson. Combining these assets would make Jeanne and Olivier the seigneurial power (senior Lord of an area) in the marches. Jeanne and Olivier had five children:\n\n\nDuring the Breton War of Succession, the de Clissons sided with the French choice for the empty Breton ducal crown, Charles de Blois, against the English preference, John de Montfort.\n\nThe extended de Clisson family was not in full agreement in this matter and Olivier IV's brother, Amaury de Clisson embraced the de Montfort party.\n\nIn 1342, the English, after four attempts, captured Vannes. Her husband Olivier and Hervé VII de Léon, the military commanders defending this city, were captured. Olivier was the only one released after an exchange for Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford (a prisoner of the French), and a surprisingly low sum was demanded. This led Olivier to be subsequently suspected of not having defended the city to his fullest, and he was alleged by Charles de Blois to be a traitor.\n\nOn 19 January 1343, the Truce of Malestroit was signed between England and France. Under the perceived safe conditions of this truce, Olivier and fifteen other Breton lords were invited to a tournament on French soil, where he was arrested, taken to Paris, tried by his peers and on 2 August 1343, executed by beheading at Les Halles.\n\nIn the year of our Grace one thousand three hundred and forty-three, on Saturday, the second day of August, Olivier, Lord of Clisson, knight, prisoner in the Chatelet of Paris for several treasons and other crimes perpetrated by him against the king and the crown of France, and for alliances that he made with the king of England, enemy of the king and kingdom of France, as the said Olivier ... has confessed, was by judgement of the king given at Orleans drawn from the Chatelet of Paris to Les Halles ... and there on a scaffold had his head cut off. And then from there his corpse was drawn to the gibbet of Paris and there hanged on the highest level; and his head was sent to Nantes in Brittany to be put on a lance over the Sauvetout gate as a warning to others.</small>\nThis execution shocked the nobility as the evidence of guilt was not publicly demonstrated, and the process of exposing a body was reserved mainly for low-class criminals. This execution was judged harshly by Froissart and his contemporaries.\n\nJeanne took her two young sons, Olivier and Guillaume, from Clisson to Nantes, to show them the head of their father at the Sauvetout gate.\n\nJeanne, enraged by her husband's execution, swore retribution against the French King, Philip VI, and Charles de Blois. She considered their actions a cowardly murder.\n\nJeanne then sold the de Clisson estates, raised a force of loyal men and started attacking French forces in Brittany.\n\nJeanne is said to have attacked a castle at Touffou and a castle occupied by Galois de la Heuse, an officer of Charles de Blois, massacring the entire garrison with the exception of one individual.\n\nJeanne also attacked another garrison at Château-Thébaud, about 20 km south east of Nantes which had been a former post under control of her husband.\n\nWith the English king's assistance and Breton sympathizers, Jeanne outfitted three warships. These were painted black and their sails dyed red. The flagship was named \"My Revenge\". The ships of this Black Fleet then patrolled the English Channel hunting down French ships, whereupon her force would kill entire crews, leaving only a few witnesses to transmit the news to the French King. This earned Jeanne the moniker \"The Lioness of Brittany\". Jeanne continued her piracy in the channel for another 13 years.\n\nJeanne is also said to have attacked coastal villages in Normandy and have put several to sword and fire. In 1346, during the Battle of Crecy, south of Calais, in northern France, Jeanne used her ships to supply the English forces.\n\nAfter the sinking of her flagship, Jeanne with her two sons were adrift for five days, her son Guillaume died of exposure. Jeanne and Olivier were finally rescued and taken to Morlaix by Montfort supporters.\n\nIn 1356, Jeanne married for a fourth time to Sir Walter Bentley, one of King Edward III's military deputies during the campaign. Bentley had previously won the battle of Mauron on 4 August 1352 and was rewarded for his services with \"the lands and castles\" Beauvoir-sur-mer, of Ampant, of Barre, Blaye, Châteauneuf, Ville Maine, the island Chauvet and from the islands of Noirmoutier and Bouin.\n\nJeanne finally settled at the Castle of Hennebont, a port town on the Brittany coast, which was in the territory of her de Montfort allies, where she died in 1359.\n\nVerifiable references relating to Jeanne’s exploits are limited, but do exist. These include:\n\n\nIn 1868, French writer Émile Pehant's novel \"Jeanne de Belleville\" was published in France. Written at the height of the French romantic movement, Pehant's novel shares many details with the legend attached to Jeanne.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52656706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52656706", "title": "Kosoko", "text": "Kosoko\n\nKosoko (died 1872) was a member of the Ologun Kutere Lagos Royal Family who reigned as Oba of Lagos from 1845 to 1851. His father was Oba Osinlokun and his siblings were Idewu Ojulari (who was Oba from 1829 to 1834/35) and Opo Olu, a wealthy and powerful female slave holder.\n\nKosoko's ascendancy to the Obaship of Lagos in 1845 was predated by a series of dramatic events.\n\nWhen Oba Ologun Kutere died (between 1800 and 1805), a succession struggle ensued between his older son (Osinlokun) and his younger and preferred son (Adele). Though the kingship was not determined by birth order but by Kingmakers and a consultation of the Ifa Oracle, Osinlokun and his followers mounted opposition to Adele's kingship. Adele's reign was then cut short in 1821 by his older brother, Osinlokun, around 1821, forcing Adele to exile to Badagry where he assumed headship of the town.\n\nKosoko offended the powerful prime minister (Eletu Odibo)and Kingmaker by marrying a woman betrothed to Chief Eletu Odibo. Eletu Odibo, as head of the Akarigbere class of chiefs, was vested with the authority to oversee the selection and installation of obas. Kosoko's arrogant decision would come to haunt his bid for the throne as Chief Eletu Odibo took great offense and the feud between both men altered the Obaship succession many times and set the stage for British intervention in Lagos later in 1851.\n\nWhen Osinlokun died in 1829, Kosoko's brother, Idewu Ojulari, became Oba and reigned from 1829 to around 1834/5. However, Idewu Ojulari's reign was unpopular and at the behest of the Oba of Benin, to whom the people of Lagos had petitioned, Idewu Ojulari committed suicide. Notably, Lagos had hitherto been under Benin suzerainty up until the reign of Oba Kosoko who was dethroned by British forces in 1851. Thereafter, Oba Akitoye and his successor, Oba Dosunmu, rebuffed payment of annual tributes to Benin.\n\nSince Kosoko was now unacceptable to Eletu Odibo, the Kingmakers invited Adele home from Badagry to rule as Oba of Lagos for a second term. Oba Adele's second reign terminated upon his death in 1837 and again, Eletu Odibo blocked Kosoko's accession and installed Oluwole, Adele's son.\n\nThe intensity of the Eletu Odibo and Kosoko feud increased with Eletu Odibo extending his vendetta to Opo Olu, Kosoko's sister, accusing her of witchcraft. The diviners found Opo Olu innocent however Oba Oluwole banished Opo Olu from Lagos, leading Kosoko and his followers to pursue a failed armed uprising known as Ogun Ewe Koko (\"leaves of the coco-yam war\") which resulted in Kosoko and his followers fleeing to Epe.\n\nEletu Odibo then ratcheted up the hatred between both camps by digging up Kosoko's mother's remains and throwing her corpse into the Lagos lagoon.\n\nOba Oluwole was killed in 1841 when lighting triggered an explosion at the Oba's place. Oluwole's body was blown to pieces and could only be identified by his royal beads adorning his body. Kingmakers would have invited Kosoko to become Oba but his whereabouts were unknown. Consequently, Akitoye, Kosoko's uncle, younger brother to Osinlokun & Adele, and son of Ologun Kutere was installed as Oba of Lagos.\n\nIn an attempt at reconciliation (met with fierce resistance from chiefs, not least Eletu Odibo) with his nephew, Oba Akitoye naively recalled Kosoko to Lagos. Kosoko returned to Lagos aboard the ship of the famous slave trader Jose Domingo Martinez. Akitoye tried to placate Kosoko with gifts and granted him the title Oloja of Ereko or owner of Ereko. Kosoko quickly consolidated his position and found support among many war chiefs and among the Muslim community. Eletu Odibo was concerned with Kosoko's power consolidation and departed for Badagry. In turn, Akitoye recalled Eletu Odibo from Badagry, leading Kosoko to declare that if Eletu Odibo returned to Lagos, he would \"make himself king\".\n\nA war of words ensued between Oba Akitoye and Kosoko sending his crier around Lagos singing \"Tell that little child at court yonder to be careful; for if he is not careful he will be punished\". Akitoye deployed his crier singing \"I am like a pin firmly driven into the ground, which is always hard to root out but ever remains firm\". Kosoko retorted \"I am the digger who always roots out a pin\".\n\nThe tensions led to an rising named Ogun Olomiro (Salt Water War) by the Kosoko faction in July 1845. The Kosoko faction laid siege to the Oba's Palace for three weeks. Akitoye eventually accepted defeat, escaped up the lagoon to the north, and was granted safe passage through the Agboyi Creek by Oshodi Tapa, Kosoko's war captain. Oshodi Tapa explained Akitoye's escape to Kosoko by saying that Akitoye put his enemies in a trance. Akitoye thereafter arrived in Abeokuta where he was granted asylum. Recognizing Akitoye's escape as a threat, Kosoko demanded Akitoye's head from the Egbas who refused Kosoko's demands. In March 1845, the Egbas provided the now deposed Akitoye with an escort to Badagry, the traditional town of refuge for Lagosians where he rallied his followers and built a partnership with European missionaries and with the British through their Consul John Beecroft.\n\nImportantly, Eletu Odibo was captured in the battle and Kosoko avenged the scattering of his mother's bones by the Eletu by placing Eletu Odibo in an empty oil barrel, sealing it, setting it alight, and dumping it in the Lagos Lagoon.\n\nA confluence of interests in Lagos from the now deposed Akitoye who allied himself with the anti-slavery cause in order to get British support, the Anglican missionaries in Badagry who were in contact with Akitoye, and Egba and European traders who wanted freer movement of goods ratcheted up British intervention in Lagos. Akitoye's anti-slavery position appears born of self-interest considering his connection with the well known slave trader Domingo Martinez who backed Akitoyes's unsuccessful attack on Lagos in 1846.\n\nIn November 1851 a British party met with Oba Kosoko to present a proposal of British friendly relations along with giving up the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade. The proposal was rejected by Kosoko \"on the technical reason that Lagos was under the Oba of Benin and that it was only that Oba who could deal with foreign powers concerning the status of Lagos\"\n\nOn 4 December 1851, upon Kosoko's successful repulsion and defeat of British forces, Consul Beecroft wrote to the Oba of Benin declaring that \"Kosoko, by opening fire on a flag of truce, had declared war on England\" and therefore had to be replaced by Akitoye. He threatened that Kosoko had till the end of the month to surrender otherwise \"Lagos would be totally destroyed by fire\". \n\nOn 26 December 1851, in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Reduction of Lagos, \"HMS Bloodhound\", \"HMS Teazer\", and a flotilla of boats mounted an attack on the Oba's palace. Kosoko put up a spirited defense but by 28 December 1851 the battle known locally as Ogun Ahoyaya or Ogun Agidingbi (after boiling cannons) was over with Kosoko and his followers fleeing to Ijebu. Akitoye was now installed Oba of Lagos with British support.\n\nOn 1 January 1852 Akitoye signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing the slave trade.\n\nKosoko eventually settled in Epe with the permission of the Awujale of Ijebu. Epe was the place where about 15 years earlier a number of his followers such as his chiefs Dada Antonio and Osho Akanbi had taken refuge. By 1852, Kosoko had built up an independent base with about 400 warriors (including Oshodi Tapa) to mount his opposition to Akitoye.\n\nIn 1853 Kosoko mounted two attacks on Lagos; one on 5 August 1853 and another on 11 August 1853 which came dangerously close to the Oba's palace but was rebuffed just in time by a burst of fire from the British naval force under Commander Phillips of HMS Polyphemus.\n\nKosoko eventually signed The Treaty of Epe on 28 September 1854 with Consul Benjamin Campbell, agreeing not to make any claims to Lagos or to endanger commerce in Lagos. The treaty was a tactical success for Kosoko who got the British to recognize his state in Epe. In the big picture, however, the Lagos throne remained out of reach with Akitoye and Dosunmu's descendants firmly rooted.\n\nIn 1860, Kosoko persuaded the Oba of Benin to send messages to Dosunmu pressing him to allow Kosoko's return to Lagos. Dosunmu, now under British authority, refused this request and noted that things were \"not as in former times when Lagos was under the King of Benin to whom annually a tribute was paid\" \n\nAfter Britain annexed Lagos via the Treaty of 1861, Kosoko was allowed to return to Lagos with the title of Oloja of Ereko, receiving a pension of £400 annually. Oshodi Tapa, settled in Epetedo.\n\nKosoko died in 1872 and was buried at Iga Ereko in Lagos. The Kosoko-Akitoye/Dosunmu rivalry spilled over into the economic realm. Oba Dosunmu's supporters didn't fully appreciate the British presence in Lagos, while Kosoko's allies exploited the relationship. Kosoko's camp comprised men such as Oshodi Tapa and Taiwo Olowo, who enthusiastically entered into trade with European firms. At the head of the Dosunmu economic faction was Chief Apena Ajasa, who repeatedly clashed with Taiwo Olowo. When Kosoko died, the colonial government estimated that his economic faction was the more powerful one due to the fact that it was composed of at least 20,000 followers.\n\nA prominent descendant of his is Omoba Jide Kosoko, a noted Nollywood actor.\n"}

She was among the last people in Europe to be subjected to lynching on the grounds of sorcery and witchcraft. \n\nKrystyna Ceynowa was the widow of a fisherman, living at Ceynowa on the Hel Peninsula, in the German Province of Prussia. She was regarded as suspicious by the community for various reasons, including the fact that she never went to church, and it was said that black crows were attracted to her chimney .This gave her a bad reputation in the eyes of the congregation and people suspected that she was a witch. However, the authorities at that time were not willing to conduct a witch trial.\n\nShe was taken captive by a lynch mob determined to test her to see if she was a witch. Her suppressors were called from Zoppot, and she was subjected to the ordeal of water during an illegal trial. The ordeal took place in the Baltic Sea - she was transported in a boat and thrown overboard. To the disbelief of many, she remained afloat for a long time, which was taken as an evidence of witchcraft, whereas nobody thought that her gown and skirt had acted as a buoy. When Ceynowa did not drown, the people found her to be a real witch and killed her with their paddles.\n\nHer case demonstrates that a belief in witchcraft continued among the public long after the legal authorities stopped accepting the charges of witchcraft, and that people occasionally took the law into their own hands when they suspected witchcraft.\n\n\n"}

It fought against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression.\n\nIn an issue of \"off our backs\", a feminist news journal, a participant recounts her experience in the 3rd World Lesbian Writers Conference on February 24, 1979 at New York City's Women's Center, in which Lorraine Bethel and Barbara Smith moderated one of the five workshops available.

{"id": "18858660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18858660", "title": "Lynne Segal", "text": "Lynne Segal\n\nLynne Segal (born 29 March 1944) is an Australian-born, British-based socialist feminist academic and activist, author of many books and articles, and participant in many campaigns, from local community to international. She has taught in higher education in London, England since 1970, at Middlesex Polytechnic from 1973. In 1999 she was appointed Anniversary Professor of Psychology and Gender Studies at Birkbeck, University of London, where she now works in the School of Psychosocial Studies.\n\nSegal is the daughter of Iza and Reuben Segal, who were both physicians. Her brother Graeme is a mathematician, her sister Barbara a baroque dancer. She was born in Sydney, and studied psychology at Sydney University, obtaining her PhD in 1969, while immersed in the anti-authoritarian milieu of the Sydney Libertarians (known as 'The Push'), and has always remained within the libertarian wing of Left politics.\n\nShe emigrated to London in 1970 and for the next decade her main energies went into grass roots politics in Islington, North London, helping to set up and run a women's centre, an alternative newspaper, the \"Islington Gutter Press\", and supporting anti-racist politics. It was a decade in which the extra-party Left was on the ascendant, but divided structurally and ideologically.\n\nIn 1979, the three friends, Segal, Sheila Rowbotham and Hilary Wainwright wrote \"Beyond the Fragments\", arguing for broader alliances among trade unionists, feminists and left political groups. Its argument quickly won a large following leading to a major conference in Leeds, Yorkshire, in 1980 and a second edition in 1981. In 1984, publisher Ursula Owen invited her to join the Virago Advisory Board and write an appraisal of the state of feminism, resulting in her first book, \"Is the Future Female? Troubled Thoughts on Contemporary Feminism\". This book reached a broad audience, with its questioning of gender mythologies, whether of women's intrinsic virtues, or men's inevitable rapaciousness, which had been appearing in the work of many popular feminist writers in the 1980s.\n\nReflecting her socialist feminist milieu, Segal argued that feminists always needed to confront the ubiquitous negation of the 'feminine', but women's battles could neither be reduced simply to battles with men, nor solved purely by revaluing the 'feminine'. All Segal's consequent books have argued for a more inclusive form of left-feminism, arguing for a more compassionate and egalitarian world. Her next book, \"Slow Motion: Changing Masculinities, Changing Men\" rejected the equating of 'male sexuality' with 'male violence', noting the complexity of forces generating very differing patterns of masculinity across time and place. Discussing the volatile fluidity of sexual experience, the same theoretical perspectives appeared in \"Straight Sex: The Politics of Pleasure\". There she deconstructs the notion of male activity and female passivity that underpin normative understandings of heterosexuality, and serve to shore up the language and practices of male dominance. In 2007 Segal published \"Making Trouble: Life and Politics, a Political Memoir\" covering her generation of post-war activists, pondering what has become of their politics in the grimmer, more divided world of the 21st century.\n\nShe has a son, Zimri Segal, working in design technology. Segal has lived in Islington, North London since she arrived from Sydney. Since 2000, she has worked, as a secular Jew, with Jews for Justice for Palestinians, Independent Jewish Voices and Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace (FFIPP) engaged in efforts to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and create a just peace between Israel and Palestine.\n\nSegal is a Labour Party member of the Islington North Constituency Labour Party in Highbury East branch.\n\nIn April 2016, she was one of 82 Jewish members and supporters of the Labour Party and of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership who wrote an open letter to \"The Guardian\" stating that they \"do not accept that antisemitism is 'rife' in the Labour party\" and that \"these accusations are part of a wider campaign against the Labour leadership, and they have been timed particularly to do damage to the Labour party and its prospects in elections in the coming week.\"\n\nIn April 2018, she was one of 40 senior academics who wrote an open letter to \"The Guardian\" condemning what they called anti-Corbyn bias in media coverage of the antisemitism debate saying it was \"framed in such a way as to mystify the real sources of anti-Jewish bigotry and to weaponise it against a single political figure just ahead of important elections.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5502549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5502549", "title": "Marco Rubio", "text": "Marco Rubio\n\nMarco Antonio Rubio (born May 28, 1971) is an American politician, attorney, and the junior United States Senator for the State of Florida. A member of the Republican Party, Rubio previously served as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Rubio unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016, winning presidential primaries in the State of Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nRubio is a Cuban American from Miami, Florida. After serving as a City Commissioner for West Miami in the 1990s, he was elected to represent the 111th district in the Florida House of Representatives in 2000. Subsequently, he was elected Speaker of the Florida House, and was Speaker for two years beginning in November 2006. Upon leaving the Florida legislature in 2008 due to term limits, Rubio started a new law firm and taught at Florida International University.\n\nRubio successfully ran for United States Senate in 2010. In April 2015, Rubio announced that he would forego seeking reelection to the Senate to run for President. He suspended his campaign for President on March 15, 2016 after losing the Florida Republican primary to the eventual winner of the presidential election, Donald Trump. On June 22, Rubio reversed his decision not to seek reelection to the Senate; he went on to defeat Democratic candidate Patrick Murphy in the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Florida.\n\nRubio will become Florida's senior senator when Bill Nelson leaves office in January 2019.\n\nMarco Antonio Rubio was born in Miami, Florida, the second son and third child of Mario Rubio Reina and Oriales (née Garcia) Rubio. His parents were Cubans who immigrated to the United States in 1956, prior to the rise of Fidel Castro in January 1959. His mother made at least four trips back after Castro’s victory, including for a month in 1961. Neither of his parents were U.S. citizens at the time of Rubio's birth, but his parents applied for U.S. citizenship and were naturalized in 1975.\n\nRubio's maternal grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, initially immigrated legally to the U.S. in 1956, but returned to Cuba to find work in 1959. When he returned to the U.S. in 1962 without a visa, he was detained as an undocumented immigrant, and an immigration judge ordered him to be deported. The immigration officials had a \"change of heart\" later the same day, the deportation order was not enforced, and Garcia was given a legal status (\"parolee\") that allowed him to stay in the U.S. Rubio's grandfather remained in the U.S. and re-applied for permanent resident status in 1966, following passage of the Cuban Adjustment Act, at which point his residency was approved. In March 2016, the \"New York Times\" reported that Garcia was put in a \"gray area\" of the law that meant he could remain in the U.S. from 1962 to 1966.\n\nMarco has three siblings: older brother Mario, older sister Barbara (married to Orlando Cicilia), and younger sister Veronica (formerly married to entertainer Carlos Ponce). Growing up, his family was Roman Catholic, though from age 8 to age 11 he and his family attended The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints while living in Las Vegas. During those years in Nevada, his father worked as a bartender at Sam's Town Hotel and his mother a housekeeper at the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. He received his first communion as a Catholic in 1984, before moving back to Miami with his family a year later. He was confirmed and later married in the Catholic Church.\n\nRubio attended South Miami Senior High School, graduating in 1989. He then attended Tarkio College in Missouri for one year on a football scholarship from 1989 to 1990, before enrolling at Santa Fe Community College (now Santa Fe College) in Gainesville, Florida. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Florida in 1993, and his J.D. degree \"cum laude\" from the University of Miami School of Law in 1996. Rubio has said that his education resulted in $100,000 of student loans, which he paid off in 2012.\n\nWhile studying law, Rubio interned for U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. He also worked on Republican Senator Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. In April 1998, two years out of law school and 26 years old, Rubio was elected to a seat as City Commissioner for West Miami before moving on to the Florida House of Representatives in early 2000.\n\nIn October 2011, newspapers reported that Rubio's previous statements that his parents were forced to leave Cuba in 1959, after Fidel Castro came to power, were embellishments. His parents actually left Cuba in 1956, during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. According to \"The Washington Post\", many voters in Florida would be less impressed by his family being economic migrants instead of political refugees from a communist regime. Rubio denied that he had embellished his family history, asserted that his parents had intended to return to Cuba in the 1960s but did not do so because of the Castro regime, and stated that \"[the] essence of my family story is why they came to America in the first place; and why they had to stay.\" Aside from Rubio's maternal grandfather who fled communist Cuba in 1962, several other relatives were also admitted to the U.S. as refugees.\n\nIn late 1999, a special election was called to fill the seat for the 111th House District in the Florida House of Representatives, representing Miami. The seat had been held by Representative Carlos Valdes, who had run for and won an open Florida State Senate seat. It was considered a safe Republican seat, so Rubio's main challenge was to win the GOP nomination. He campaigned as a moderate, advocating tax cuts and early childhood education.\n\nRubio placed second in the Republican primary on December 14, 1999, but won the run-off election for the Republican nomination, defeating Angel Zayon (a television and radio reporter who was popular with Cuban exiles) by just 64 votes. He then defeated Democrat Anastasia Garcia with 72% of the vote in a January 25, 2000 special election.\n\nIn November 2000, Rubio won re-election unopposed. In 2002, he won re-election to a second full term unopposed. In 2004, he won re-election to a third full term with 66% of the vote. In 2006, he won re-election to a fourth full term unopposed.\n\nRubio spent almost nine years in the Florida House of Representatives. Since the Florida legislative session officially lasted only 60 days, he was able to spend about half of each year in Miami, where he worked first at a law firm that specialized in land use and zoning, and later starting in 2004, took a position with Broad and Cassel, a Miami law and lobbying firm, though state law precluded him from engaging in lobbying or introducing legislation on behalf of the firm's clients.\n\nAt the time Rubio took his seat in the legislature in Tallahassee in January 2000, voters in Florida had recently approved a constitutional amendment on term limits. This created openings for new legislative leaders due to many senior incumbents having to retire. According to an article in \"National Journal\", Rubio also gained an extra advantage in that regard, because he was sworn in early due to the special election, and he would take advantage of these opportunities to join the GOP leadership.\n\nLater in 2000, the majority leader of the House, Mike Fasano, promoted Rubio to be one of two majority whips. \"National Journal\" described that position as typically requiring a lot of arm-twisting, but said Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them.\n\nFasano resigned in September 2001 as majority leader of the House due to disagreements with the House speaker, and the speaker passed over Rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for Fasano. Rubio volunteered to work on redistricting, which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions, then working individually with the lawmakers involved, and this work helped to cement his relationships with GOP leaders.\n\nIn December 2002, Rubio was appointed House Majority Leader by Speaker Johnnie Byrd. He persuaded Speaker Byrd to restructure the job of Majority Leader, so that legislative wrangling would be left to the whip’s office, and Rubio would become the main spokesperson for the House GOP.\n\nAccording to \"National Journal\", during this period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles, and some colleagues described him as a centrist \"who sought out Democrats and groups that don’t typically align with the GOP\". He co-sponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates to the children of undocumented immigrants. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers, and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students.\n\nAs a state representative, Rubio requested legislative earmarks (called \"Community Budget Issue Requests\" in Florida), totaling about $145 million for 2001 and 2002, but none thereafter. Additionally, an office in the executive branch compiled a longer list of spending requests by legislators, including Rubio, as did the non-profit group Florida TaxWatch. Many of those listed items were for health and social programs that Rubio has described as \"the kind of thing that legislators would get attacked on if we didn't fund them.\" A 2010 report by the \"Tampa Bay Times\" and \"Miami Herald\" said that some of Rubio’s spending requests dovetailed with his personal interests. For example, Rubio requested a $20 million appropriation for Jackson Memorial Hospital to subsidize care for the poor and uninsured, and Rubio later did work for that hospital as a consultant. A spokesman for Rubio has said that the items in question helped the whole county, that Rubio did not lobby to get them approved, that the hospital money was necessary and non-controversial, and that Rubio is \"a limited-government conservative ... not a no-government conservative\".\n\nOn September 13, 2005, at age 34, Rubio became speaker after State Representatives Dennis Baxley, Jeff Kottkamp, and Dennis A. Ross dropped out. He was sworn in a year later, in November 2006. He became the first Cuban American to be speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, and would remain speaker until November 2008.\n\nWhen he was chosen as future speaker in 2005, Rubio delivered a speech to the House in which he asked members to look in their desks, where they each found a hardcover book titled \"100 Innovative Ideas For Florida’s Future\"; but the book was blank because it had not yet been written, and Rubio told his colleagues that they would fill in the pages together with the help of ordinary Floridians. In 2006, after traveling around the state and talking with citizens, and compiling their ideas, Rubio published the book. The \"National Journal\" called this book \"the centerpiece of Rubio’s early speakership\". About 24 of the \"ideas\" became law, while another 10 were partially enacted. Among the items from his 2006 book that became law were multiple-year car registrations, a requirement that high schools provide more vocational courses, and an expanded voucher-like school-choice program. Rubio's defenders, and some critics, point out that nationwide economic difficulties overlapped with much of Rubio's speakership, and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult.\n\nAs Rubio took office as speaker, Jeb Bush was completing his term as governor, and Bush left office in January 2007. Rubio hired 18 Bush aides, leading capitol insiders to say the speaker's suite was \"the governor’s office in exile.\" An article in \"National Journal\" described Rubio's style as being very different from Bush's; where Bush was a very assertive manager of affairs in Tallahassee, Rubio's style was to delegate certain powers, relinquish others, and invite political rivals into his inner circle. As incoming speaker, he decided to open a private dining room for legislators, which he said would give members more privacy, free from being pursued by lobbyists, though the expense led to a public relations problem.\n\nIn 2006, Florida enacted into law limitations upon the authority of the state government to take private property, in response to the 2005 Supreme Court decision in Kelo v. City of New London which took a broad view of governmental power to take private property under eminent domain. This state legislation had been proposed by a special committee chaired by Rubio prior to his speakership.\n\nJeb Bush was succeeded by Charlie Crist, a moderate Republican who took office in January 2007. Rubio and Crist clashed frequently. Their sharpest clash involved the governor's initiative to expand casino gambling in Florida. Rubio sued Crist for bypassing the Florida Legislature in order to make a deal with the Seminole Tribe. The Florida Supreme Court sided with Rubio and blocked the deal.\n\nRubio also was a critic of Crist's strategy to fight climate change through an executive order creating new automobile and utility emissions standards. Rubio accused Crist of imposing \"European-style big government mandates,\" and the legislature under Rubio's leadership weakened the impact of Crist's climate change initiative. Rubio said that Crist’s approach would harm consumers by driving up utility bills without having much effect upon the environment, and that a better approach would be to promote biofuel (e.g. ethanol), solar panels, and energy efficiency.\n\nRubio introduced a plan to reduce state property taxes to 2001 levels (and potentially eliminate them altogether), while increasing sales taxes by 1% to 2.5% to fund schools. The proposal would have reduced property taxes in the state by $40–50 billion. His proposal passed the House, but was opposed by Governor Crist and Florida Senate Republicans, who said that the increase in sales tax would disproportionately affect the poor. So, Rubio agreed to smaller changes, and Crist's proposal to double the state's property tax exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 (for a tax reduction estimated by Crist to be $33 billion) ultimately passed. Legislators called it the largest tax cut in Florida's history up until then. At the time, Republican anti-tax activist Grover Norquist described Rubio as \"the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country.\"\n\nAs speaker, Rubio \"aggressively tried to push Florida to the political right,\" according to NBC News, and frequently clashed with the Florida Senate, which was run by more moderate Republicans, and with then-Governor Charlie Crist, a centrist Republican at the time. Although a conservative, \"behind the scenes many Democrats considered Rubio someone with whom they could work,\" according to biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia. Dan Gelber of Miami, the House Democratic leader at the time of Rubio's speakership, considered him \"a true conservative\" but not \"a reflexive partisan,\" saying: \"He didn't have an objection to working with the other side simply because they were the other side. To put it bluntly, he wasn't a jerk.\" Gelber considered Rubio \"a severe conservative, really far to the right, but probably the most talented spokesman the severe right could ever hope for.\"\n\nWhile Speaker of the Florida House, Rubio shared a residence in Tallahassee with another Florida State Representative, David Rivera, which the two co-owned. The house later went into foreclosure in 2010 after several missed mortgage payments. At that point, Rubio assumed responsibility for the payments, and the house was eventually sold.\n\nIn 2007, Florida State Senator Tony Hill (D-Jacksonville), chairman of the state legislature's Black Caucus, requested that the legislature apologize for slavery, and Rubio said the idea merited discussion. The following year, a supportive Rubio said such apologies can be important albeit symbolic; he pointed out that even in 2008 young African-American males \"believe that the American dream is not available to them\". He helped set up a council on issues facing black men and boys, persuaded colleagues to replicate the Harlem Children's Zone in the Miami neighborhood of Liberty City, and supported efforts to promote literacy and mentoring for black children and others.\n\nIn 2010 during Rubio's senate campaign, and again in 2015 during his presidential campaign, issues were raised by the media and his political opponents about some items charged by Rubio to his Republican Party of Florida American Express card during his time as House speaker. Rubio charged about $110,000 during those two years, of which $16,000 was personal expenses unrelated to party business, such as groceries and plane tickets. Rubio said that he personally paid American Express more than $16,000 for these personal expenses. In 2012, the Florida Commission on Ethics cleared Rubio of wrongdoing in his use of the party-issued credit card, although the commission inspector said that Rubio exhibited a \"level of negligence\" in not using his personal MasterCard. In November 2015, Rubio released his party credit card statements for January 2005 through October 2006, which showed eight personal charges totaling $7,243.74, all of which he had personally reimbursed, in most instances by the next billing period. When releasing the charge records, Rubio spokesman Todd Harris said, \"These statements are more than 10 years old. And the only people who ask about them today are the liberal media and our political opponents. We are releasing them now because Marco has nothing to hide.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Florida Legislature in 2008, Rubio started his own law firm, and also began teaching under a fellowship appointment at Florida International University (FIU) as an adjunct professor. In 2011, he rejoined the FIU faculty after entering the U.S. Senate, and he has taught on most Mondays and Fridays, when the Senate is usually not in session. Rubio teaches in the Department of Politics and International Relations, which is part of FIU's Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs. He has taught up to four undergraduate courses per year, on Florida politics, political parties, and legislative politics.\n\nRubio's reviews from students have been positive, even from students who disagree with him politically. He generally gives the impression of being unbiased and nonpartisan, and when offering his own opinion identifies it as such. Rubio says that he wants students, when they watch the news, to have an appreciation for what is really going on behind the scenes, and says that teaching \"forces me to stop sometimes and analyze things\".\n\nAs of 2015, Rubio's appointment as an FIU professor is no longer a matter of partisan criticism, though it was initially. The university obtained considerable state funding when Rubio was speaker of the Florida House, but many other university jobs were being eliminated due to funding issues at the time FIU appointed him to the faculty. According to news reporting about Rubio's speakership, he \"might have helped FIU get money early, but all the projects already had been scheduled for funding by the state's Board of Governors.\" The president of the faculty senate at the time criticized the appointment, and Charlie Crist raised the issue against Rubio during the 2010 U.S. Senate election. Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said that the position was approved in advance by the Senate Ethics Committee, which was then led by Barbara Boxer. The director of FIU's School of International and Public Affairs says that Rubio \"brings a great deal of insight and hands-on knowledge of the political process to the classroom...our students will learn from a sitting U.S. senator, which is an incredible opportunity.\"\nWhen Rubio accepted the fellowship appointment as an adjunct professor at FIU, he agreed to raise most of the funding for his position from private sources. Billionaire Norman Braman, also a major campaign donor to Rubio, donated $100,000 to finance the teaching position. Rubio's office says that other senators, such as then-Senator Joe Biden, have held teaching positions during their terms of office.\n\nOn May 5, 2009, Rubio announced on his website that he planned to run for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Mel Martínez, who had announced that he would not seek reelection. Martinez subsequently announced (in August 2009) that he would resign before completing his term, and upon his resignation was replaced by George LeMieux. Prior to making his May 5, 2009 announcement, Rubio had been meeting with fundraisers and supporters throughout the state. Initially trailing by double-digits in the primary against the incumbent Governor of his own party, Charlie Crist, Rubio eventually surpassed Crist in polling for the Republican nomination. In his campaign, Rubio received the support of members of the Tea Party, many of whom were dissatisfied with Crist's policies as governor.\n\nOn April 28, 2010, Crist announced he would be running without a party affiliation, effectively ceding the Republican nomination to Rubio.\n\nSeveral of Crist's top fundraisers, as well as Republican leadership, refused to support Crist after Rubio won the Republican nomination for the Senate.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Rubio won the general election with 49 percent of the vote to Crist's 30% and Democrat Kendrick Meek's 20%. Following his victory in the elections, Rubio soon became the subject of speculation as a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election. When Rubio was sworn in to the U.S. Senate, he and Bob Menendez of New Jersey were the only two Latino Americans in the Senate.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, despite his previous statements that he would not run for reelection to his Senate seat, Rubio \"seemed to open the door to running for re-election,\" citing the previous day's 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and how \"it really gives you pause, to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,\" officially announcing his candidacy nine days later, on June 22. Rubio won the Republican primary on August 30, 2016, defeating Carlos Beruff. He faced Democratic nominee Patrick Murphy in the general election, defeating him with 52% of the vote.\n\nDuring Rubio’s first four years in the U.S. Senate, Republicans were in the minority, but since January 2015 Republicans have been the Senate majority party.\n\nShortly after taking office in 2011, Rubio said he had no interest in running for president or vice president in the 2012 presidential election. In March 2012, when he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, Rubio said that he did not expect to be or want to be selected as a vice presidential running mate, but was vetted for vice president by the Romney campaign. Former Romney aide Beth Myers has said that the vetting process turned up nothing disqualifying about Rubio.\n\nUpon taking office, Rubio hired Cesar Conda as his chief of staff. Conda, a former adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, and former top aide to Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Robert Kasten (R-Wis.), was succeeded in 2014 as Rubio's chief of staff by his deputy, Alberto Martinez, but Conda remained as a part-time adviser.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Rubio became an influential defender of the United States embargo against Cuba, and induced the State Department to withdraw an ambassadorial nomination of Jonathan D. Farrar, who was the Chief of Mission of the United States Interests Section in Havana from 2008 to 2011. Rubio believed that Farrar was not assertive enough toward the Castro regime. Also in 2011, he was invited to visit the Reagan Library, during which he gave a well-publicized speech praising its namesake, and also rescued Nancy Reagan from falling.\n\nIn March 2011, Rubio supported U.S. participation in the military campaign in Libya to oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He urged that Senate leaders bring \"a bi-partisan resolution to the Senate floor authorizing the President's decision to participate in allied military action in Libya\". The administration decided that no congressional authorization was needed under the War Powers Resolution; Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) joined Rubio in writing an opinion piece for the \"Wall Street Journal\" in June 2011 again urging passage of such authorization. In October 2011, Rubio joined several other Senators in pushing for continued engagement to \"help Libya lay the foundation for sustainable security.\" Soon after Gadhafi was ousted, Rubio warned there was a serious threat posed by the spread of militias and weapons, and called for more U.S. involvement to counter that threat.\n\nRubio voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included mandatory automatic budget cuts from sequestration. He later said that defense spending should never have been linked to taxes and the deficit, calling the policy a \"terrible idea\" based on a \"false choice.\"\n\nThe following month, Rubio and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, co-sponsored the American Growth, Recovery, Empowerment and Entrepreneurship Act (AGREE Act), which would have extended many tax credits and exemptions for businesses investing in research and development, equipment, and other capital; provided a tax credit for veterans who start a business franchise; allowed an increase in immigration for certain types of work visas; and strengthened copyright protections.\n\nIn 2012, Rubio introduced a bill, co-sponsored by Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, to allow employers to be exempted from newly mandated coverage for contraception based on religious or moral grounds, but it was not adopted in the Senate.\n\nRubio voted against the 2012 \"fiscal cliff\" resolutions. Although he received some criticism for this position, he responded: \"Thousands of small businesses, not just the wealthy, will now be forced to decide how they'll pay this new tax, and, chances are, they'll do it by firing employees, cutting back their hours and benefits, or postponing the new hires they were looking to make. And to make matters worse, it does nothing to bring our dangerous debt under control.\"\n\nIn 2013, Rubio was part of the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" Senators that crafted comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Rubio proposed a plan providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States involving payment of fines and back taxes, background checks, and a probationary period; that pathway was to be implemented only after strengthening border security. The bill passed the Senate 68 to 32 with his support, but Rubio then signaled that the bill should not be taken up by the House because other priorities, like repealing Obamacare, were a higher priority for him; the House never did take up the bill. Rubio has since explained that he still supports reform, but a different approach instead of a single comprehensive bill.\n\nRubio was chosen to deliver the Republican response to President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union Address. It marked the first time the response was delivered in English and Spanish. Rubio's attempt to draw a strong line against the looming defense sequestration was undercut by fellow Republican senator Rand Paul's additional response to Obama's speech that called for the sequester to be carried out.\n\nIn April 2013, Rubio voted against an expansion of background checks for gun purchases, contending that such increased regulatory measures would do little to help capture criminals.\n\nIn May 2013, Rubio proposed the Regulation Costs to Small Businesses Act which would have required the Small Business Administration to conduct an annual study to estimate the total cost of regulations on small businesses.\n\nIn July 2013, Rubio and Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, introduced the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2013. The bill would require federal agencies to monitor and regularly report on the performance of foreign assistance programs based on specified goals and metrics. The reports would be published publicly. According to Rubio: \"America’s foreign assistance programs need greater transparency to ensure that they are advancing our values and interests overseas.\"\n\nIn 2014, Rubio co-sponsored legislation with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, to revise the process for calculating and collecting student loans. The legislation would base student loan payments on the student's subsequent income and automatically collect payments from paychecks in order to simplify the process and eliminate loan servicer fees.\n\nRepublicans took control of the U.S. Senate as a result of the elections in November 2014. As this new period of Republican control began, Rubio pushed for elimination of the \"risk corridors\" used by the federal government to compensate insurers for their losses as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The risk corridors were intended to be funded by profitable insurers participating in the PPACA. However, since insurer losses have significantly exceeded their profits in the program, the risk corridors have been depleted. His efforts contributed to the inclusion of a provision in the 2014 federal budget which prevented other funding sources from being tapped to replenish the risk corridors.\n\nIn February 2015, Rubio took the position that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs was \"simply buckling under the weight of its own bureaucracy\", and he endorsed their proposal to open veterans' care to private providers.\n\nIn March 2015, Rubio and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, proposed a tax plan which, according to \"The Wall Street Journal\", combined thinking from \"old-fashioned, Reagan-era supply siders\" and a \"breed of largely younger conservative reform thinkers\" who are concerned with the tax burden on the middle-class. The plan would lower the top corporate income tax rate from 38% to 25%, eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, and create a new child tax credit worth up to $2,500 per child. The plan would set the top individual income tax rate at 35%. It also included a proposal to replace the means-tested welfare system, including food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit, with a new \"consolidated system of benefits\".\n\nAccording to analysis by Vocativ as reported by Fox News, Rubio has missed 8.3 percent of total votes since taking office, from January 2011 to February 2015. From October 27, 2014, to October 26, 2015, Rubio voted in 74 percent of Senate votes, according to an analysis by GovTrack.us, which tracks Congressional voting records. In 2015, Rubio was absent for about 35 percent of Senate votes. In historical context Rubio's attendance record for Senate votes is not exceptional among senators seeking a presidential nomination, such as Senator John McCain whose percentage of missed votes in 2007 was much higher. However it is the worst of the three senators who campaigned for the presidency in 2015.\n\nDuring his Senate tenure, Rubio has co-sponsored bills on issues ranging from humanitarian crises in Haiti to the Russian incursion into Ukraine, and has been a frequent and prominent critic of President Obama's efforts in the field of national security.\n\nOn May 17, 2016, Rubio broke from the Republican majority in his support of President Obama's request for a $2 billion funding for emergency spending toward the Zika virus at a time when Florida accounted for roughly 20% of the recorded cases of Zika in the U.S., acknowledging that it was the president's request but furthering that \"it’s really the scientists’ requests, the doctors’ request, the public health sector’s request for how to address this issue.\" On August 6, Rubio stated he does not believe in terminating Zika-infected pregnancies.\n\nOn December 13, after President-elect Trump announced Rex Tillerson as his pick for Secretary of State in the incoming administration, Rubio expressed concerns with the selection. On January 11, Rubio questioned Tillerson during a senate committee hearing on his confirmation, saying afterward he would \"do what's right\". On January 23, Rubio confirmed that he would vote for Tillerson, stating that a delay in the appointment would be counter to national interests.\n\nOn April 5, 2017, Rubio said Bashar al-Assad felt he could act with \"impunity\" in knowing the United States was not prioritizing removing him from office. The following day, Rubio praised Trump's ordered strike: \"By acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over.\"\n\nOn May 21, 2017, Rubio said he wanted \"to know the entire truth\" about possible ties between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia while on CNN's \"State of the Union\".\n\nOn June 18, 2017, Rubio said new sanctions passed by the Senate against Russia were not being opposed by Trump, and he did not believe \"the president himself has a problem with additional sanctions on Russia\".\n\nIn August 2017, after the Raise Act was unveiled, a bill aimed at reforming immigration, Rubio predicted it would not be approved in the Senate and noted its similarities to the bipartisan attempt at comprehensive immigration reform legislation four years prior.\n\nIn September 2017, after President Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for six months, Rubio called for an outline on \"what kind of legislation the president is willing to sign\" to prevent unwanted proposals.\n\nIn the first session of the 115th United States Congress, Rubio was ranked the tenth most bipartisan Senator by the Bipartisan Index, published by The Lugar Center and Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nWhile ballots were being counted in a close Florida Senate race between Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson and Republican challenger Rick Scott, Rubio without evidence argued that Democrats were conspiring with election officials to illicitly install Nelson into he U.S. Senate. Rubio argued without evidence that \"democrat lawyers\" were descending on Florida and that \"they have been very clear they aren’t here to make sure every vote is counted.\" He claimed that Broward County officials were engaged in \"ongoing\" legal violations, without specifying what those were. Election monitors found no evidence of voter fraud in Broward County, and the Florida State Department found no evidence of criminal activity.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, he chairs the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, as well as the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights and Global Women's Issues. His committee memberships are as follows.\n\nRubio stated in April 2014 that he would not run for both the Senate and President in 2016, as Florida law prohibits a candidate from appearing twice on a ballot, but at that time he did not rule out running for either office. He later indicated that even if he would not win the Republican nomination for president, he would not run for reelection to the Senate. Also in April 2014, the departure of Cesar Conda, Rubio's chief of staff since 2011, was seen as a sign of Rubio's plans to run for President in 2016. Conda departed to lead Rubio's Reclaim America PAC as a senior adviser. Groups supporting Rubio raised over $530,000 in the first three months of 2014, most of which was spent on consultants and data analytics, in what was seen as preparations for a presidential campaign.\n\nA poll from the WMUR/University, tracking New Hampshire Republican primary voters' sentiment, showed Rubio at the top alongside Kentucky senator Rand Paul later in 2013, but as of April 18, 2014, he had dropped to 10th place behind other Republican contenders. The poll, however, also suggested that Rubio was not disliked by the primary voters, which was thought to be positive for him if other candidates had chosen not to run. Rubio placed second among potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates in an online poll of likely voters conducted by Zogby Analytics in January 2015.\n\nIn January 2015, it was reported that Rubio had begun contacting top donors and appointing advisors for a potential 2016 run, including George Seay, who previously worked on such campaigns as Rick Perry's in 2012 and Mitt Romney's in 2008, and Jim Rubright, who had previously worked for Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain. Rubio also instructed his aides to \"prepare for a presidential campaign\" prior to a Team Marco 2016 fundraising meeting in South Beach.\n\nOn April 13, 2015, Rubio announced that he would run for President in 2016. Rubio was believed to be an acceptable candidate for the 2016 presidential race who could attract many parts of the GOP base, partly because of his youthfulness and oratorical skill. Rubio had pitched his candidacy as an effort to restore the American Dream for middle and working-class families, who might have found his background as a working-class Cuban-American appealing.\n\nIn the first Republican primary, the February 1 Iowa caucuses, Rubio finished third, behind candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. During a nationally televised debate among Republican candidates in New Hampshire on February 6, 2016, Rubio was criticized by rival Chris Christie for speaking repetitiously and sounding scripted. On February 9, when he placed fifth in the New Hampshire primary results, Rubio took the blame and acknowledged a poor debate performance. In the third Republican contest, the South Carolina primary on February 20, Rubio finished second, but did not gain any delegates as Trump won all of South Carolina's congressional districts and thus delegates. Jeb Bush left the race that day, leading to a surge in campaign donations and endorsements to Rubio. On February 23, Rubio finished second in the Nevada caucuses, again losing to Trump.\n\nAt another Republican debate on February 25, Rubio repeatedly criticized frontrunner candidate Donald Trump. It was described by CNN as a \"turning point in style\" as Rubio had previously largely ignored Trump during his campaign, and this deviated from Rubio's signature \"optimistic campaign message\". The next day Rubio continued turning Trump's attacks against him, even ridiculing Trump's physical appearance. On March 1, called 'Super Tuesday' with eleven Republican contests on that day, Rubio's sole victory was in Minnesota, the first state he had won since voting began a month prior. Rubio went on to win further contests in Puerto Rico on March 6 and the District of Columbia on March 12, but lost eight other contests from March 5 to 8. Around that time, Rubio revealed he was not \"entirely proud\" of his personal attacks on Trump.\n\nOn March 15, Rubio suspended his campaign after placing second in his own home state of Florida. Hours earlier, Rubio had expressed expectations for a Florida win, and said he would continue to campaign (in Utah) \"irrespective of\" that night's results. The result was that Rubio won 27.0% of the Florida vote, while Trump won 45.7% and all of Florida's delegates. The conclusion of the six March 15 contests (out of which Rubio won none) left Rubio with 169 delegates on the race to reach 1237, but Ted Cruz already had 411 and Trump 673. On March 17, Rubio ruled out runs for the vice-presidency, governorship of Florida and even re-election for his senate seat. He only stated that he would be a \"private citizen\" by January 2017, leading to some media speculation of the termination of his political career.\n\nOn April 12, during an interview with Mark Levin, Rubio expressed his wishes that Republicans would nominate a conservative candidate, name-dropping Cruz. This was interpreted as an endorsement of Cruz, though Rubio clarified the following day that he had only been answering a question. Rubio would later explain his decision to not endorse Cruz being due to his belief that the endorsement would not significantly benefit him and a desire to let the election cycle play out. On April 22, Rubio said he was not interested in being the vice presidential candidate to any of the remaining GOP contenders. On May 16, Rubio posted several tweets in which he critiqued sources reporting that he despised the Senate and a \"Washington Post\" story that claimed he was unsure of his next move after his unsuccessful presidential bid, typing, \"I have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January.\"\nOn May 18, after Trump expressed a willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un, Rubio said Kim was \"not a stable person\" and furthered that Trump was only open to the meeting due to inexperience with the North Korea leader. On May 26, Rubio told reporters that he was backing Trump due to his view that the presumptive nominee was a better choice than Hillary Clinton for the presidency and that as president, Trump would sign a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and replace the late Antonin Scalia with another conservative Supreme Court Justice. He also confirmed that he would be attending the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where he intended to release his pledged delegates to support Trump. On May 29, Rubio continued disavowing vice presidential speculation but indicated an interest in playing a role in Trump's campaign. On June 6, Rubio rebuked Trump's comments on Gonzalo P. Curiel, who Trump accused of being biased against him on the basis of his ethnicity, as \"offensive\" while speaking with reporters, advising that Trump should cease defending the remarks and defending the judge as \"an American.\"\n\nOn July 6, Olivia Perez-Cubas, Rubio's Senate campaign spokeswoman, said he would not be attending the Republican National Convention due to planned campaigning on the days the convention was scheduled to take place.\n\nDuring the Republican primary campaign in which Rubio and Donald Trump were opponents, Rubio criticized Trump, including, in February 2016, calling Trump a \"con artist\" and saying that Trump is \"wholly unprepared to be president of the United States.\" In June 2016, after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee, Rubio reaffirmed his February 2016 comments that we must not hand \"the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual.\" However, after Trump won the Republican Party's nomination, Rubio endorsed him on July 20, 2016. Following the October 7, 2016, Donald Trump \"Access Hollywood\" controversy, Rubio wrote that \"Donald's comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify. No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private.\" On October 11, 2016, Rubio reaffirmed his support of Trump. On October 25, 2016, it was reported that Rubio was booed off a stage for endorsing Trump by a crowd of mostly Latino voters, at the annual \"Calle Orange\" street festival in downtown Orlando.\n\nAs of early 2015, Rubio had a rating of 98.67 by the American Conservative Union, based on his lifetime voting record in the Senate. According to the \"National Journal\", in 2013 Rubio had been the 17th most conservative senator. The Club for Growth gave Rubio ratings of 93 percent and 91 percent based on his voting record in 2014 and 2013 respectively, and he has a lifetime rating from the organization above 90 percent.\n\nRubio initially won his U.S. Senate seat with strong Tea Party backing, but his 2013 support for comprehensive immigration reform legislation led to a decline in that support. Rubio's stance on military, foreign policy and national security issues—such as his support for arming the Syrian rebels and for the NSA—alienated some libertarian-oriented Tea Party activists.\n\nRubio supports balancing the federal budget, while prioritizing defense spending. He disputes the scientific understanding of climate change, arguing that human activity does not play a major role in global warming and that proposals to address climate change would be ineffective and economically harmful. On Obamacare, he wants to repeal it and replace it with tax credits and less regulation. He opposes net neutrality, a principle of requiring Internet service providers to treat data on the Internet the same regardless of its source or content. With regard to immigration, he supports securing the country's borders and then offering a legal status to people who came to the United States unlawfully. He also believes there should be more vetting of refugees and that seeking a single comprehensive immigration reform bill would be delusional.\n\nRubio is an outspoken opponent of abortion. In an interview with Chris Cuomo of CNN, he stated that, \"Every life is worthy of protection\". During the 113th Congress, Rubio co-sponsored S.1670 - Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which prohibits an abortion from being performed if the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child is 20 weeks or greater, with exceptions in the case of rape or incest or if the life of the mother is in danger.\n\nRubio opposes decriminalization of illegal drugs and does not agree with cannabis legalization, but he does support non-euphoric medical cannabis. Rubio supports setting corporate taxes at 25 percent, reforming the tax code, and capping economic regulations, and proposes to increase the social security retirement age based on longer life expectancy. On education, he supports expanding public charter schools, opposes Common Core State Standards, and advocates closing the federal Department of Education.\n\nRubio supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and military intervention in Libya. Rubio voiced support for a Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Iran-backed Shia Houthis. Regarding Iran, he supports tough sanctions, and scrapping the recent nuclear deal; on the Islamic State, he favors aiding local Sunni forces in Iraq and Syria. Rubio says that the United States cannot accept more Syrian refugees because background checks cannot be done under present circumstances. He supports working with allies to set up no-fly zones in Syria to protect civilians from Bashar al-Assad. He favors collection of bulk metadata for purposes of national security. He has said that gun control laws consistently fail to achieve their purpose and as of 2017 had received $3,303,355 in donations from the National Rifle Association. He is supportive of the Trans Pacific Partnership, saying that the U.S. risks being excluded from global trade unless it is more open to trade. He is wary of China regarding national security and human rights, and wants to boost the U.S. military presence in that region but hopes for greater economic growth as a result of trading with that country. He also believes the U.S. should support democracy, freedom, and true autonomy of the people of Hong Kong. On capital punishment, Rubio favors streamlining the appeals process.\n\nIn February 2018 he attracted controversy following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting at a town hall event held by CNN when he was questioned by a survivor of the shooting about the supposed $3,303,355 he had received in donations from the NRA. Rubio replied, \"I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda.\"\n\nIn March 2018, Rubio defended the decision of the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Experts noted that the inclusion of such a question would likely result in severe undercounting of the population and faulty data, as undocumented immigrants would be less likely to respond to the census. Fellow Republican congress members from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, criticized the Trump administration's decision on the basis that it would lead to a faulty census and disadvantage Florida in terms of congressional apportionment and fund apportionment.\n\nIn July 2018, Rubio offered an amendment to a major congressional spending bill to potentially force companies that purchase real estate in cash to disclose their owners as “an attempt to root out criminals who use illicit funds and anonymous shell companies to buy homes.\"\n\nRubio married Jeanette Dousdebes, a former bank teller and Miami Dolphins cheerleader, in 1998 in a Catholic ceremony at the Church of the Little Flower, and together they have four children. Rubio and his family live in West Miami, Florida.\n\nRubio attends Catholic Mass at Church of the Little Flower in Coral Gables, Florida. He also previously attended Christ Fellowship, a Southern Baptist Church in West Kendall, Florida.\n\nVote totals in races where Rubio was unopposed were not reported.\n\n\nRubio has been awarded the following foreign honor:\n\n\n"}

Her father was a railway foreman. Her parents moved to Stonehaven where she attended Mackie Academy before going on to take a job as a clerk in solicitors' office. In 1943 she signed up for the Auxiliary Territorial Service and was selected for the Royal Corps of Signals, where she was trained in receiving Morse code. She was then assigned to Bletchley Park as an interceptor of German and Italian coded signals. Adams stated that she preferred to intercept Italian signals as Italians were often excitable when transmitting which lead them to make mistakes causing them to repeat their messages, and thereby giving her a second chance to capture their messages.\n\nHaving signed the Official Secrets Act, Adams did not talk to anyone, not even her husband, about her work during the war. When MI6 officer Frederick Winterbotham published his book \"The Ultra Secret\" in 1974, she then felt able to mention her work.\n\nAdams married Bob Adams, an accountant, in 1950.

{"id": "20926639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20926639", "title": "Michael Bennet", "text": "Michael Bennet\n\nMichael Farrand Bennet (born November 28, 1964) is an American businessman, lawyer and politician serving as the senior United States Senator from Colorado, a seat he has held since 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, he was appointed to the seat when Ken Salazar resigned to become Secretary of the Interior. Bennet previously worked as managing director for the Anschutz Investment Company, chief of staff to then-Denver Mayor (and current Colorado Governor) John Hickenlooper, and superintendent of Denver Public Schools.\n\nBennet is the son of Douglas J. Bennet, a former State Department official and president of Wesleyan University. Early in his career, Bennet worked for Ohio Governor Richard Celeste. He went on to receive his Juris Doctor degree, after which he worked as a law clerk and later as Counsel to the U.S. Deputy Attorney General in the Clinton Administration.\n\nBennet became superintendent of the Denver public school system in July 2005. Bennet was speculated in late 2008 as a candidate for Obama's United States Secretary of Education. He was appointed by Governor Bill Ritter to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Ken Salazar when Salazar became Secretary of the Interior in January 2009. Bennet was elected in the 2010 Senate election where he defeated Republican Ken Buck. He chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) for the 2014 cycle and was reelected in the 2016 elections.\n\nHe was born in New Delhi while his father, Douglas J. Bennet, was serving as an aide to Chester Bowles, then the U.S. ambassador to India. Douglas Bennet ran the United States Agency for International Development under President Jimmy Carter, served as President and CEO of National Public Radio (1983–93), and Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs in the Clinton Administration (1993–95).\n\nHis grandfather, Douglas Bennet, had been an economic adviser in Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. Bennet's mother, Susanne Christine (née Klejman), immigrated to the United States with her family in 1950. Her parents were Polish Jews and survived imprisonment in the Warsaw Ghetto. Bennet's mother is a retired elementary school librarian.\n\nBennet grew up in Washington, D.C. as his father served as an aide to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, among others. Bennet was held back in second grade because of his struggle with dyslexia. He was enrolled at St. Albans School, an elite all-boys preparatory school, and served as a page on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn 1987, Bennet earned his B.A. degree in history from Wesleyan University, the alma mater of his father and grandfather. At Wesleyan, Bennet was a member of Beta Theta Pi. Bennet earned his J.D. degree from Yale Law School, where he was the Editor-in-Chief of the \"Yale Law Journal\".\n\nFrom 1988 until 1990, when he left to attend Yale, he served as an aide to Ohio Governor Richard Celeste. After law school he served as a law clerk for the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and as an associate to Washington attorney Lloyd Cutler. He then served as Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General during Bill Clinton's administration. Douglas Bennet worked in the Clinton White House as well, as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs. Following a stint as an assistant to the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, Bennet left the legal world and moved West. After briefly living in Montana, Bennet moved with his fiancé to Colorado in 1997. Bennett worked for six years in Denver as Managing Director for the Anschutz Investment Company, where he led the reorganization of an oil company and helped consolidate three movie theater chains into the Regal Entertainment Group.\n\nWhile working for Anschutz, Bennet befriended fellow Wesleyan alumnus John Hickenlooper, informally advising the latter's successful campaign for Mayor of Denver. Moving back into public service, Bennet served for two years as Hickenlooper's Chief of Staff.\n\nBennet was appointed superintendent of Denver Public Schools on June 27, 2005, taking office on the following July 1. Bennet had no experience as a school administrator. In 2008, Bennet persuaded the Denver Board of Education to enter into a 30-year, $750 million financial bond transaction with variable interest rates designed to fluctuate as economic conditions changed. \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"In short order, the transaction went awry because of stress in the credit markets, problems with the bond insurer and plummeting interest rates.\" As of 2010, the school system had paid $115 million in interest and other fees, at least $25 million more than it originally anticipated.\n\nBennet was among the many officials whose names were circulated for United States Secretary of Education in the Obama Administration, which was eventually filled by Arne Duncan. Bennet and his wife were early supporters of Barack Obama's presidential bid during the 2008 Democratic primaries and he was among those who advised Barack Obama on education issues.\n\nOn January 3, 2009, he was named by Colorado Governor Bill Ritter to fill the seat in the United States Senate vacated by United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar on January 20. Ritter chose Bennet after interviewing several prominent Colorado Democrats, and Bennet took the job with the blessing of Hickenlooper. Upon taking office on January 21, 2009, he stated that he would seek election at the end of his term in 2010.\n\nIn a January 2011 article in \"Time\" entitled \"Shaking Schools Up in an Already Tumultuous Year,\" the author of the article, Andrew J. Rotherham, said of Bennet: \"If the federal No Child Left Behind Act is modified this year, or if anything else of significance happens in Washington on education policy, this Colorado Democrat will be at the center of it.\"\n\nBennet ran for election for a full term as Senator from Colorado in the 2010 election. On September 16, 2009, former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff announced his campaign to challenge Bennet for the Democratic nomination.\nBennet received endorsements from President Barack Obama, U.S. Senator Mark Udall, and U.S. Representatives Betsy Markey, Jared Polis, and John Salazar of the Colorado congressional delegation. Bennet raised $7 million and had a four-to-one cash advantage over his opponent, Andrew Romanoff.\n\nOn August 10, 2010, Bennet defeated Romanoff in the primary and won his party's nomination, facing Republican candidate Ken Buck. The campaign became one of the most expensive in the country, with the candidates spending a reported $15 million combined, and outside groups another $30 million. Bennet portrayed Buck as an extremist conservative opposed to abortion and direct election of Senators, while Buck and the groups supporting him characterized Bennet as a big-spending liberal.\n\nAfter Bennet won election, President Obama said Bennet \"perfectly reflects the qualities of the ruggedly independent state he has been chosen to serve.\"\n\nOn November 3, the day after polls closed, Bennet was declared the winner and Buck conceded. Bennet won by 851,590 votes (48.1%) to 822,731 (46.4%). He subsequently returned to Washington in January 2011 to start a full six-year term.\n\nBennet was re-elected to a second term on November 8, 2016. He defeated Republican Candidate and El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn. Bennet received 1.36 million votes, 156,248 more than Glenn. He received 31,780 more votes than Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who also won the state in the general election. Bennet received more votes than any other Democrat in a statewide race in Colorado history. He also won more votes in Colorado's rural counties than any other statewide Democrat in state history.\n\nFollowing the election, President Obama said Bennet was one of the \"gifted Democratic politicians\" that could lead the party in the future.\n\nBennet sits on the following committees and subcommittees in the 115th United States Congress (2017–2019).\n\nSource: United States Senate\n\nAs of 2010, Bennet had earned a \"C+\" rating from the National Rifle Association for a mixed record regarding his votes for gun rights. In 2012, Bennet joined then Colorado Senator Mark Udall in asking for stricter gun control, in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In response to the shooting, Bennet stated that \"In Colorado, we support the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, we support the ability of people to hunt and recreate and to protect their families and homes, and we want to keep the wrong weapons out of the hands of the wrong people.\"\n\nBennet participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster, demanding that gun laws be changed in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting. During his participation in the filibuster, Bennet talked about the 2012 Aurora shooting, citing that as a response to the shooting, the state of Colorado closed gun sale loopholes and now requires background checks for any gun purchase.\n\nIn response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Bennet demanded universal background checks regarding gun sales and described the shooting as domestic terrorism.\n\nBennet voted in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. In November 2009, when the bill was still working its way through Congress, Bennet said that he would support health care reform even if it meant losing the election. In 2016, in response to healthcare costs in western and central Colorado, which has some of the highest healthcare costs in the United States, Bennet said he \"didn't have answers\" and called it \"next to impossible\" to fix the Affordable Care Act given partisan attitudes at that time.\n\nAs part of a group of Democrats proposing \"more incremental steps to broaden health care coverage\", as opposed to Bernie Sanders's push of \"Medicare for All\", Senator Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet have proposed \"Medicare X\". Medicare X would \"create a public option modeled after Medicare alongside private options on the ObamaCare marketplaces\".\n\nIn September 2009, Bennet cosponsored the DREAM Act (S. 729), which proposed amending the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 by giving residency to immigrants enrolled in higher education programs or serving in the military. In 2013, Bennet was a member of the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of four Democratic and four Republican U.S. Senators who introduced comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Their bill, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, passed the U.S. Senate with a vote of 68-32, but stalled in the House due to opposition from the Republican majority.\n\nIn 2009, Bennet co-sponsored the Solar Manufacturing Jobs Creation Act, legislation that would have provided a tax credit to support solar manufacturing in the U.S. The legislation was not enacted.\n\nHe was one of the handful of Democratic Senators who have supported construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, voting for it in 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n\nBennet has cosponsored the bipartisan STATES Act proposed in the 115th U.S. Congress by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and fellow Colorado Senator Cory Gardner that would exempt individuals or corporations in compliance with state cannabis laws from federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nOn October 26, 1997, he married Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund attorney Susan Diane Daggett, in Marianna, Arkansas. They have three daughters and reside in Denver's Congress Park neighborhood.\n\nThough not raised in an observant household, Bennet acknowledges his family's Jewish roots. Bennet has stated that he was \"raised with two different heritages, one [that] was Jewish and one [that] was Christian,\" and that he believes in God.\n\nHis brother, James Bennet, is the editorial page director for \"The New York Times\".\n\n\n"}

He was the first president of the Cooperative Health Federation of America and an advocate for cooperative health care and preventive medicine.\n\nShadid was born in 1882 in Marjayoun, Lebanon, the youngest of 12 children. He attended the American University's high school in Beirut and in 1898 immigrated to the United States where he was a pack peddler and sold cheap jewelry and buttons door to door. Shadid attended John Tarleton College in Stephenville, Texas in 1902 and received a degree in medicine from Washington University in St. Louis in 1907. While in medical school, Shadid joined the Socialist Party of America. He ran for Congress as a New Deal democrat but was defeated by Sam Massingale. He married Adeeba Shadid and they had six children: Bess, Fred, Ethel, Alexander, Ruth, and Helen.\n\nIn 1923, Shadid left a successful practice in Carter, Oklahoma and settled in Elk City. He found that farmers of the region were not receiving adequate medical care and did not have a hospital they could afford. Shadid called a meeting of his farmer patients and proposed a cooperatively owned clinic and hospital in Elk City. The Oklahoma Farmers' Union supported the measure and the hospital was opened by the Community Health Association, Inc. in August 1931. The reception from the medical community was icy. Although he had been a member of the Beckham County Medical Society for over 20 years, the society expelled him. The Oklahoma Board of Medical Examiners attempted to revoke Shadid's license and the State Medical Association tried to get a bill passed against medical cooperatives in the Oklahoma Legislature. The bill was defeated with the help of the Oklahoma Farmers' Union. The Farmers' Union took control of the hospital and the health plan in 1934. By 1939, Community Hospital served 15,000 farmers in the southwestern Oklahoma. During the later years of his life, Dr. Shadid suffered from diabetes, resulting in having both legs amputated. With both legs missing, Dr. Shadid traveled to Russia alone in a wheel chair to speak about socialized medicine.(Authority: first-hand knowledge of Dr. Shadid's grand-daughter, S. Candice Campbell, whose mother was Bess Campbell, Dr. Shadid's daughter.)\n\nShadid traveled throughout the United States and Europe and gave speeches where he advocated for cooperative health care. He helped launch a health co-op in Deer Park, Washington and assisted the organizing committee that led to the formation of Group Health Cooperative. Shadid helped found the Cooperative Health Federation of America in 1947. He served as the Foundation's president from 1947 to 1949. In 1960 he built Hospital Haramoon in the Lebanese village where he was born. Shadid died in Kansas on August 13, 1966 and is buried in Oklahoma City at Fairlawn Cemetery. He was inducted into the Cooperative Development Foundation's Cooperative Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\n"}

News agencies categorized this group’s acts as “a new form of protest in Iran.”\n\nThe Tapandegan first appeared publicly on May 24, 2018 when they hacked the arrival and departure monitors at Mashhad International Airport and on June 6, 2018 when they also hacked the arrival and departure monitors at Tabriz International Airport. The group posted anti-government messages and images, forcing the airports’ authorities to turn off manually those monitors one-by-one. Airport officials in both cities turned off the sign boards for several hours after the hacking and made apologetic public statements.\n\nThe Iranian authorities confirmed both cyber-attacks shortly after they took place and they were widely reported by the Iranian official press and the international news wires and agencies.\n\nThe group’s name is in the Persian language meaning \"Palpitaters\". Based on the messages they posted on those hacked monitors, the news sources noted that the group supports the national protests of the people in Iran demanding economic improvements.\n\nIran has seen frequent nationwide protests this year by demonstrators angered by local and national officials and business leaders who they accuse of corruption and oppression. The two anti-government hacks at Iranian airports are the only incidents of their kind since the protests began in late December.\n\nHacking attacks in Iran have been on the rise recently. In August 2016, Internet security experts warned that hackers have found access to banking and contact details of millions of Iranians by hacking into their Telegram accounts. However, it is not yet clear whether this was a genuine warning or an attempt by hardliners in the Iranian government to convince people to leave Telegram and migrate to home-grown messaging services, where the government has easy access to users’ private information and can intercept their communications.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press’ report from Tehran, Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported that The Tapandegan “managed to interrupt routine broadcasts on monitors” at the Mashhad International Airport on Thursday evening, May 24, 2018, “replacing them with images of anti-government protests from January [2018]”“for several hours.”\n\nSources report that according to a statement posted by the hackers on the monitors, the group protested to “wasting Iranians lives and financial resources in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).” The message posted on sign boards also protested against the IRGC’s presence in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere in the region. The group also hacked the email of Mashhad airport civil aviation head, Mohsen Eidizadeh and sent the news of its hack from his account.\n\nMashhad is the city where massive anti-government demonstrations started on December 28 and spread to over 100 other Iranians cities. It is a religious city where the holy shrine of the 8th Shiite Imam is located. Local authorities and clerics in the city are among the staunchest hardliners. The group expressed support for the people of Kazeroon, a city in Fars Province, where people have been demonstrating against the state of months.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press’ report from Tehran, Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported that on June 6, 2018, the hackers “have disrupted the arrival and departure monitors in the Tabriz international airport in the country’s northwest.” The hackers defaced sign boards in the evening, showing a protest message against “wasting Iranians’ resources\" and expressing support for Iranian truckers who have been on strike across Iran for several weeks.\n\nIranian truck drivers went on strike for more than a week beginning May 22 in several parts of Iran, using social media to mobilize and share images of themselves protesting low wages and rising business costs.\n\nThe Iranian state-run site, \"Young Journalists’ Club (YJC)\", “quoted Tabriz Governor Aliyar Rastgoo as saying the incident happened Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. local time.” A Tabriz airport official Mostafa Safaei confirmed the day after the cyber-attack that the monitors turned off following the hack and engineers quickly restored the system, and the incident was under investigation.\n\nTranslation of the message posted by the hackers on the monitors in Persian reads:\n\n\"Attention, attention. We, Tapandegan, in another protest action, are currently taking control of the computer systems of this airport. Two weeks ago, in protest against the wastage of the Iranian people’s money and lives by (Iran’s) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, we took control of the computer systems in Mashhad airport. Today, by voicing our support for Iranian strikers, we are doing the same thing. Until when will this regime deprive people of their rights to have a better livelihood and economic situation?! Until when?! We will not choke off our voices. We will continue these actions. If you support us, take a photo of this and share it\"\n\nThe Tapandegan assumed responsibility for the hacking in a tweet on June 7.\n\nSources report that The Tapandegan sent an email to Iranian journalists saying, “Two weeks ago, we took over the computer systems of Mashhad Airport in support of the national protests. We protested against wasting Iranian lives and assets by IRGC [The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. And, today, we support the truck drivers, the bazar, and the strikers”.\n\n"}

The feminine form is \"yogini\", but is not always used, especially in the West.\n\n\"Yogi\", or \"jogi\", since the 12th century CE, while meaning those dedicated to Yoga practice, has also referred to members of the Nath siddha tradition of Hinduism. Alternatively, in tantra traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, a practitioner of tantra (a \"tantrika\") may also be called a \"yogi\". In Hindu mythology, god Shiva and goddess Parvati are depicted as an emblematic yogi–yogini pair.\n\nIn Classical Sanskrit, the word \"yogi\" (Sanskrit: masc ', योगी; fem ') is derived from \"yogin\", which refers to a practitioner of yoga. \"Yogi\" is technically male, and \"yoginī\" is the term used for female practitioners. The two terms are still used with those meanings today, but the word \"yogi\" is also used generically to refer to both male and female practitioners of yoga and related meditative practices belonging to any religion or spiritual method.\n\nThe term yogini is also used for divine goddesses and enlightened mothers, all revered as aspects of the mother goddess, Devi.\n\nA yogi, states Banerjea, should not be confused with someone practicing asceticism and excessive self-mortification.\n\nIn Hinduism the term \"yogi\" refers to an adherent of yoga.\n\nThe earliest evidence of yogis and their spiritual tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the Keśin hymn 10.136 of the Rigveda, though with the terminology of Rudra who evolved into Shiva worshipped as the lord of Yoga in later Hinduism. The Hindu scripture Rigveda uses words of admiration for the Yogis, whom it refers to as Kesin, and describes them as follows (abridged):\n\nThe term yogin appears in \"Katyayana Shrauta-sutra\" and chapter 6 of Maitri Upanishad, where the implied context and meaning is \"a follower of the Yoga system , a contemplative saint\".\n\nThe term sometimes refers to a person who belongs to the Natha tradition. They usually belong to Shaiva tradition, but some Natha belong to the Vaishnava tradition. In both cases, states David Lorenzen, they practice yoga and their principal god tends to be Nirguna, that is a god that is without form and semi-monistic, influenced in the medieval era by the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, Madhyamaka school of Buddhism, as well as Tantra and Yogic practices.\nThe Yoga-Bhashya (400 CE), the oldest extant commentary on the Yoga-Sutra offers the following fourfold classification of yogis:\n\nA yogi or yogini aspires to Brahmacharya (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मचर्य), which means celibacy if single, or non-cheating on one's partner.\n\nThere have been two parallel views, in Hindu texts, on sexuality for a yogi and yogini. One view asserts restraint in sexual activity, towards monk- and nun-like asexuality, as transmutation away from worldly desires and onto a spiritual path. It is not considered, states Stuart Sovatsky, as a form of moralistic repression but a personal choice that empowers the yoga practitioner to redirect his or her energies. The second view, found particularly in Tantra traditions according to David Gordon White, asserts that sexuality is an additional means for a yogi or yogini to journey towards and experience the bliss of \"one realized god-consciousness for oneself\". In the second view, sexuality is a yogic practice, and one broadly revered through the \"lingam\"–\"yoni\" iconography of Shiva–Parvati, the divine yogi–yogini in Hindu mythology.\n\nA yogi or yogini lives by other voluntary ethical precepts called Yamas and Niyamas. These include:\n\nAccording to David White,\nArcheological evidence suggests that in some contexts and regions, yogi of the Nath Siddha tradition were respected and recognized in India. For example, inscriptions suggest a general of the Yadava king Ramacandra donated a village to a yogi in 13th-century. Near Mangalore, that later became a hub of Nath yogis, a monastery and temple was dedicated to yogis in the 10th-century.\n\nDavid Lorenzen states that the Nath yogis have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia, with medieval era \"tales and stories about Nath yogis such as Gorakhnath, Matsyendra, Jalandhar, Gopichand, Bharthari, Kanhapa and Chaurangi\" continuing to be remembered in contemporary times, in the Deccan, western and northern states of India and in Nepal.\n\nIn some contexts, adds White, the term \"yogi\" has also been a pejorative term used in medieval India for a Nath siddha, particularly on the part of India's social, cultural and religious elites. The term \"siddha\" has become a broad sectarian appellation, applying to Saiva-devotees in the Deccan (\"Maheśvara siddhas\"), alchemists in Tamil Nadu (\"siddhars\" or \"sittars\"), a group of early Buddhist tantrikas from Bengal (\"mahasiddhas\", \"siddhacaryas\"), the alchemists of medieval India (\"rasa siddha\"), and a mainly north Indian group known as the \"Nath siddhas\". The Nath siddhas are the only still existing representatives of the medieval Tantric tradition, which had disappeared due to its excesses. While the Nath siddhas enjoyed persistent popular success, they attracted the scorn of the elite classes.\nAccording to White, the term \"yogi\", has \"for at least eight hundred years, been an all-purpose term employed to designate those Saiva specialists whom orthodox Hindus have considered suspect, heterodox, and even heretical in their doctrine and practice\". The yoga as practiced by these Yogis, states White, is more closely identified in the eyes of those critics with black magic, sorcery and sexual perversions than with yoga in the conventional sense of the word.\n\nThe Nath Yogis were targets of Islamic persecution in the Mughal Empire. The texts of Yogi traditions from this period, state Shail Mayaram, refer to oppressions by Mughal officials such as governor. The Mughal documents confirm the existence of Nath Yogis in each \"pargana\" (household neighborhoods), and their persecution wherein Nath Yogis were beheaded by Aurangzeb.\n\nAccording to David Lorenzen, the religious groups in Hinduism that militarized and took up arms following the Muslim conquest of India, to resist persecution, appeared among the Nath or Kanphata yogis, often called simply yogis or jogis.\n\nThe warrior ascetics were institutionalized as a religious order by Gorakhnath and were expanding in the 13th century, after the establishment of the first Islamic Sultanate in India. They interacted and cooperated with \"fakirs\" of Sufi Muslims. The yogis feature prominently in Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire period official documents, states David White, both in terms of impressing the ruling elite in the Muslim administration and awards of receiving land grants in some cases such as by Akbar, as well as those yogis who targeted the elite merchants and disrupted the business of administrative Islamic elites in urban areas. In other cases, yogis from the Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism marshaled armed resistance against the Mughal and British colonial armies.\n\nThe history of Nath yogis has been diverse, such as in the 11th and 12th centuries, when Buddhists in South India converted to Nath siddha traditions and helped establish Shiva Hindu temples and monasteries.\n\nHistorical yogis and yoga gurus:\n\n\n"}
