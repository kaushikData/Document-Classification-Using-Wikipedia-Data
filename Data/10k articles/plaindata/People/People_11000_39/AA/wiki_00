His family was displaced by the bombing of their village, Kennour, part of the Tizi Ouzou Province, by the French airforce. After the war, Abdelli's family settled in the coastal town of Dellys. As a boy, Abdelli constructed his first guitar out of an empty oil can, a plank of wood and fishing line. After learning to play the guitar, Abdelli was introduced to the mandol by Chaabi master, Chaïd Moh-Esguir.\n\nAbdelli made his musical debut in Dellys, Kabylie, during the 1974 Algerian Independence festival. He won several contests in Algeria for amateur singers. Abdelli produced his first album in 1984, but it saw little success. Two years later, he released an album that sold 12,000 copies, but never received payment from his record company Abdelli produced a couple of albums in Algeria, but moved to Belgium in 1984. It was there \"he met producer Thierry Van Roy, who was so fascinated with Abdelli's music that he spent two years exploring the roots of the Berbers' musical tradition at the University of Algiers.\" Since 1986 he has made his home in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nAbdelli's most popular albums are \"New Moon\" and \"Among Brothers\" He has performed at major festivals in Europe, including WOMAD and the 0110 concert in Ghent. In addition to Europe he has toured in England, the USA and Canada.\n\nAbdelli's music reflects a heavy Algerian influence. As stated by World Music Central:\n\nAbdelli's lyrics express strong and poetic images of his culture which is threatened from all sides. He expresses himself essentially by symbols which are parts of his traditional culture. He tries to make known the ancient Berber culture which, by its tolerance and openness, is an example to follow in our troubled world.\n\nAbdelli has collaborated with musicians from Europe and South America, often incorporating instruments such as the cajón (Peru), the tormento, the quena (Chilean), and the bandura (Ukrainian).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18951616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18951616", "title": "Alan Alda", "text": "Alan Alda\n\nAlan Alda (; born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo; January 28, 1936) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, comedian and author. A six-time Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award winner, he played Hawkeye Pierce in the war television series \"M*A*S*H\" (1972–1983). He has also appeared on television programs such as \"Scientific American Frontiers\", \"The West Wing\", and \"30 Rock\", and in films such as \"Same Time, Next Year\" (1978) and \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989). He also experienced success as a director with 1981's \"The Four Seasons\". In 2004, Alda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in \"The Aviator\".\nAlda was born Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo on January 28, 1936 in the Bronx, New York City, and had a peripatetic childhood, as his parents traveled around the United States in support of his father's job as a performer in burlesque theatres. His father Robert Alda (born Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Roberto D'Abruzzo) was an actor and singer, and his mother Joan Browne was a homemaker and former beauty-pageant winner. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. His adopted surname, \"Alda\", is a \"portmanteau\" of \"AL\"phonso and \"D'A\"bruzzo.\n\nWhen Alda was seven years old, he contracted polio. To combat the disease, his parents administered a painful treatment regimen developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny, consisting of applying hot woolen blankets to his limbs and stretching his muscles. Alda attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, New York. In 1956, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Fordham College of Fordham University in the Bronx, where he was a student staff member of its FM radio station, WFUV. Alda's half-brother, Antony Alda, born that year (1956), also became an actor.\n\nDuring Alda's junior year, he studied in Paris, acted in a play in Rome, and performed with his father on television in Amsterdam. In college, he was a member of the ROTC, and after graduation, he served for a year at Fort Benning, and then six months in the United States Army Reserve on a tour of duty in Korea.\n\nIn 1956, while attending Fordham, he met Arlene Weiss, who was attending Hunter College. They bonded at a mutual friend's dinner party; when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the kitchen floor, they were the only two guests who did not hesitate to eat it. A year after his graduation, on March 15, they were married. They have three daughters: Eve, Elizabeth, and Beatrice. Two of his eight grandchildren are aspiring actors. In an intimate interview Alda revealed that Arlene sometimes will call him “Fonzi” in reference to his birth name “Alphonso”.\n\nThe Aldas have been longtime residents of Leonia, New Jersey. Alda frequented Sol & Sol Deli on Palisade Avenue in the nearby town of Englewood, New Jersey—a fact mirrored in his character's daydream about eating whitefish from the establishment in an episode of \"M*A*S*H\" in which Hawkeye sustains a head injury.\n\nAlda began his career in the 1950s, as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational, comedy revue directed by Paul Sills. He joined the acting company at the Cleveland Play House during the 1958-59 season as part of a grant from the Ford Foundation, appearing in productions such as \"To Dorothy A Son\", \"Heaven Come Wednesday\", \"Monique\", and \"Job\". In the November 1964 world premiere at the ANTA Playhouse of the stage version of \"The Owl and The Pussycat\", he played Felix the \"Owl\" opposite the \"Pussycat\" which was played by actress/singer Diana Sands. He continued to play Felix the \"Owl\" for the 1964-65 Broadway season. In 1966, he starred in the musical \"The Apple Tree\" on Broadway, also starring Barbara Harris; he was nominated for the Tony Award as Best Actor in a Musical for that role.\n\nAlthough from away, Alan Alda says he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse.\n\nAlda was part of the cast, along with David Frost, Henry Morgan and Buck Henry, of the American television version of That Was The Week That Was, which ran as a series from January 10, 1964 to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in \"Gone are the Days!\" – a film version of the Broadway play \"Purlie Victorious\", which co-starred Ruby Dee and her husband, Ossie Davis. Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor George Plimpton in the film \"Paper Lion\" (1968), as well as \"The Extraordinary Seaman\" (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller \"The Mephisto Waltz\", with actresses Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of \"What's My Line?\". He also appeared as a panelist on \"I've Got a Secret\" during its 1972 syndication revival.\n\nIn early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of Hawkeye Pierce in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film \"MASH\". He was nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 2½-hour series finale \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", which was also the 32nd episode he directed. It remains the single most-watched episode of any American broadcast network television series. Alda is the only series regular to appear in all 251 episodes.\nAlda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey every weekend for 11 years while starring in \"M*A*S*H\". His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey, and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, especially because he did not know how long the show would last.\n\nAlda's father, Robert Alda, and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in an episode of \"M*A*S*H\", \"Lend a Hand\", during season eight. Robert had previously appeared in \"The Consultant\" in season three.\nDuring the first five seasons of the series, the tone of \"M*A*S*H\" was largely that of a traditional \"service comedy\", in the vein of shows such as \"McHale's Navy\". However, as the original writers gradually left the series, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, \"M*A*S*H\" retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a somewhat more serious tone, openly addressing political issues. As a result, the 11 years of \"M*A*S*H\" are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart/Gene Reynolds \"comedy\" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda \"dramatic\" years (1977–1983). Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he stated, \"I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that.\"\n\nFor the first three seasons, Alda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together, but later, tensions increased, particularly as Alda's role grew in popularity. Rogers and Stevenson both left the show at the end of the third season. At the beginning of the fourth season, Alda and the producers decided to find a replacement actor to play the surrogate parent role formerly taken by Colonel Blake. They eventually found veteran actor and fan of the series, Harry Morgan, who starred as Colonel Sherman T. Potter, becoming another of the show's protagonists. Mike Farrell was also introduced as Alda's co-star BJ Hunnicutt.\n\nIn his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper (who directed several early episodes) wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and that the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's directing of \"M*A*S*H\" ended.\n\nDuring his \"M*A*S*H\" years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably in \"The $10,000 Pyramid\" and as a frequent panelist on \"What's My Line?\" and \"To Tell the Truth\".\n\nHis favorite episodes of \"M*A*S*H\" are \"Dear Sigmund\" and \"In Love and War\".\n\nIn 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on \"TV Guide\"'s \"50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time\".\n\nThe following is a list of \"M*A*S*H\" episodes written and/or directed by Alda.\n\nAlda's prominence in the enormously successful television series \"M*A*S*H\" provided him a platform to speak out on political topics. He has been a strong and vocal supporter of women's rights and the feminist movement. He co-chaired, with former First Lady Betty Ford, the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown campaign. In 1976, \"The Boston Globe\" dubbed him \"the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon\" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nAlda played Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman in the play \"QED\", which had only one other character. Although Peter Parnell wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. Alda has also appeared frequently in the films of Woody Allen, and was a guest star five times on \"ER\", playing Dr. Kerry Weaver's mentor, Gabriel Lawrence. During the later episodes, Dr. Lawrence was revealed to be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. Robert Gallo in the 1993 TV movie \"And the Band Played On\".\n\nDuring \"M*A*S*H\"'s run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble dramedy, \"The Four Seasons\" being perhaps his most notable hit. \"Betsy's Wedding\" is his last directing credit to date. After \"M*A*S*H\", Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his \"nice guy\" image.\n\nIn 1993, he co-starred with Woody Allen (also the director), Diane Keaton, and Anjelica Huston in the comedy/mystery \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\". The four play a quartet of amateur crime solvers who become entangled in a murder plot possibly perpetrated by Keaton and Allen's neighbor. Alda's character is Ted, a playwright secretly in love with Keaton's character Carol, but who eventually falls for Huston's character Marcia.\n\nFrom the fall season of 1993 until the show ended in 2005, Alda was the host for \"Scientific American Frontiers\", which began on PBS in 1990.\n\nIn 1995, he starred as the President of the United States in Michael Moore's political satire/comedy film \"Canadian Bacon\". Around this time, rumors circulated that Alda was considering running for the United States Senate in New Jersey, but he denied this. In 1996, Alda played Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, in \"Camping With Henry and Tom\", based on the book by Mark St. Germain and appeared in the comedy film, \"Flirting with Disaster\". In 1999, Alda portrayed Dr. Gabriel Lawrence in NBC program \"ER\" for five episodes and was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nBeginning in 2004, Alda was a regular cast member on the NBC program \"The West Wing\", portraying Republican U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Arnold Vinick, until the show's conclusion in May 2006. He made his premiere in the sixth season's eighth episode, \"In The Room\", and was added to the opening credits with the 13th episode, \"King Corn\". In August 2006, Alda won an Emmy for his portrayal of Vinick in the final season of \"The West Wing\". Alda appeared in a total of 28 episodes during the show's sixth and seventh seasons. Alda had been a serious candidate, along with Sidney Poitier, for the role of President Josiah Bartlet before Martin Sheen was ultimately cast in the role.\n\nIn 2004, Alda portrayed conservative Maine Senator Owen Brewster in Martin Scorsese's Academy Award-winning film \"The Aviator\", in which he co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nThroughout his career, Alda has received 31 Emmy Award nominations and two Tony Award nominations, and has won seven People's Choice Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and three Directors Guild of America awards. Alda received his first Academy Award nomination, for his role in \"The Aviator\", in 2005.\n\nAlda also wrote several of the stories and poems that appeared in Marlo Thomas' television show \"Free to Be... You and Me\".\n\nAlda starred in the original Broadway production of the play \"Art\", which opened on March 1, 1998, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play.\n\nAlda also had a part in the 2000 romantic comedy \"What Women Want\", as the CEO of the advertising firm where the main characters worked.\n\nIn early 2005, Alda starred as Shelly Levene in the Tony Award-winning Broadway revival of David Mamet's \"Glengarry Glen Ross\", for which he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Throughout 2009 and 2010, he appeared in three episodes of \"30 Rock\" as Milton Greene, the biological father of Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). In January 2010, Alda hosted \"The Human Spark\", a three-part series originally broadcast on PBS discussing the nature of human uniqueness and recent studies on the human brain.\n\nIn 2011, Alda was scheduled to guest star on \"\", portraying former police and naval officer John Winters, the father of the former main character . It is unknown whether he filmed his role before the series was redesigned and Rex Winters written off.\n\nAfter the release of his movie \"Tower Heist\", Alda was devastated when on December 7, 2011, his decades-long friend Harry Morgan from \"M*A*S*H\" died.\n\nAlda returned to Broadway in November 2014, playing the role of Andrew Makepeace in the revival of \"Love Letters\" at the Brooks Atkinson Theater alongside Candice Bergen.\n\nIn 2016, Alda appeared in Louis C.K.'s web-based series \"Horace and Pete\" as the irascible Uncle Pete in what IndieWire critic Sam Adams described as \"his best role in years\" in an otherwise lukewarm review.\n\nIn July 2018 Alda began hosting a podcast, \"Clear + Vivid with Alan Alda\".\n\nAlda has done extensive charity work. He helped narrate a 2005 St. Jude's Children's Hospital-produced one-hour special TV show \"Fighting for Life\". His wife, Arlene, and he are also close friends of Marlo Thomas, who is very active in fund-raising for the hospital that her father, Danny Thomas founded. The television special featured Ben Bowen as one of six patients being treated for childhood cancer at Saint Jude. Alda and Marlo Thomas had also worked together in the early 1970s on a critically acclaimed children's album entitled \"Free to Be You and Me\", which featured Alda, Thomas, and a number of other well-known character actors. This project remains one of the earliest public signs of his support of women's rights.\n\nIn 2005, Alda published his first round of memoirs, \"Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I've Learned\". Among other stories, he recalls his intestines becoming strangulated while on location in La Serena, Chile, for his PBS show \"Scientific American Frontiers\", during which he mildly surprised a young doctor with his understanding of medical procedures, which he had learned from \"M*A*S*H\". He also talks about his mother's battle with schizophrenia. The title comes from an incident in his childhood, when Alda was distraught about his dog dying and his well-meaning father had the animal stuffed. Alda was horrified by the results, and took from this that sometimes we have to accept things as they are, rather than desperately and fruitlessly trying to change them.\n\nIn 2006, Alda contributed his voice to a part in the audio book of Max Brooks' \"World War Z\". In this book, he voiced Arthur Sinclair, Jr., the director of the United States government's fictional Department of Strategic Resources (DeStRes).\n\nHis second memoir, \"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself\", weaves together advice from public speeches he has given with personal recollections about his life and beliefs.\n\nFor 14 years, he served as the host of \"Scientific American Frontiers\", a television show that explored cutting-edge advances in science and technology. He is a visiting professor at Stony Brook University and a founder and member of the advisory board of the university's Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and the Future of Life Institute. He serves on the board of the World Science Festival and is a judge for Math-O-Vision.\n\nAlda also has an avid interest in cosmology, and participated in BBC coverage of the opening of the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN, Geneva, in September 2008.\n\nAfter years of interviews, Alda helped inspire the creation of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University in 2009. He remains on the advisory board . He was named an Honorary Fellow by the Society for Technical Communication in 2014 for his work with the Center for Communicating Science and the annual Flame Challenge. He is also on the advisory board of the Future of Life Institute. Alda would like to use his expertise in acting and communication to help scientists communicate more effectively to the public. In 2014 Alda was awarded the American Chemical Society's James T. Grady-James H. Stack Award for Interpreting Chemistry for the Public for his work in science communication. He was awarded the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal in 2016 \"for his extraordinary application of the skills honed as an actor to communicating science on television and stage, and by teaching scientists innovative techniques that allow them to tell their stories to the public.\"\n\nIn \"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself\", Alda describes how as a teen he was raised as a Roman Catholic and eventually he realized he had begun thinking like an agnostic or atheist. While he admits to still praying on occasion, he said he wants to find meaning in this life rather than worrying about the next one. While he still talks to God on occasion, he admits it often comes at times of fear rather than out of a sense of belief. Furthermore, he doesn't like to be labeled as an \"agnostic,\" stating it's too fancy a word for him in an interview for the 2008 question section of the Edge Foundation website. He argues he simply isn't a believer and questions why people are so frightened of others who hold beliefs different than their own.\n\nOn July 31, 2018, he appeared on \"CBS This Morning\" and announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years prior.\n\n\n\nAlan Alda has been awarded several honorary degrees in recognition of his acting career and promotion of educational initiatives. These include:\n\n\n"}

A member of the nobility of Anjou, he was appointed in 1540 to his father's prestigious former post of Grand Falconer of France, one of the Great Officers of the Maison du Roi. This was not purely honorary, as the king still hunted with falcons. Brissac was also \"Grand Panetier\", and his position as colonel general of the cavalry (1548–49) was a court appointment. Raised to Marshal of France in 1550, he was Grand Master of the Artillery. He was eventually given the title of Count of Brissac. His son, Charles II de Cossé, became the first Duke of Brissac.\n\nThe son of René de Cossé, seigneur of Brissac and of Cossé in Anjou, \"grand fauconnier du Roi\", and of his wife Charlotte de Gouffier, he was an \"enfant d'honneur\" in the household of the dauphin François, son of King François I. The young prince made him his \"premier écuyer\".\n\nNot robust by nature, he made himself an agile swordsman and horseman. Sent to the siege of Naples in 1528, he made a name for himself when his forces were being attacked by the Spanish. Upon embarking from the galleys, he was forced back to the shore's edge. There, helmetless and without his cuirass, afoot, sword in hand, he made prisoner the armed knight on horseback who attacked him. Later, he commanded a hundred light cavalry at the taking of Avigliana and at the castle of Susa in 1537.\n\n\"Grand fauconnier de France\" since 1540, he was named in 1542 as \"colonel général des gens de guerre français, à pied, de là les monts\". At the siege of Perpignan, fighting under the new Dauphin (later King Henri II), he covered himself with glory when the besieged forces surprised the unwary young nobles engaged in gaming in the Dauphin's tent, defended the pieces of artillery until the infantry regrouped and relieved him.\n\nAs colonel general, he was in command of all the light cavalry in Piedmont in 1543 and that same year followed the king to Flanders, where he took 600 prisoners. In the following retreat of Habsburg forces and their allies, he took prisoner Francesco d'Este, brother of the Duke of Ferrara. In the return to France, he took the exposed position of rear guard at great personal danger.\n\nIn 1544, with his light cavalry, he was sent to harass Imperial forces at Vitry-en-Perthois, was twice taken prisoner and twice rescued by his troops. The following year, he fought at Oye in the Boulonnais. Following the peace that was agreed in 1546, he was made Grand Master of Artillery.\n\nIn the Italian War of 1551–1559 and the War of Parma, as Maréchal de France (1550), Brissac was sent as governor to French-occupied Piedmont, where he distinguished himself by the strict discipline kept in the occupying army, maintained in fighting trim by regular military exercises and forbidden to harass peasants, merchants or bourgeois, which was considered remarkable at the time.\n\nIn 1551, Brissac established himself at Chieri and several other Piedmontese cities, obliging Gonzaga to raise the siege of Parma. In 1553, he took Vercelli and pillaged the treasury of Charles III, Duke of Savoy, which had been transported there as an impregnable place of safety. Though he was unable to take the citadel for lack of cannon, the energetic presence of Brissac in Piedmont forced the Duke to reinforcee his garrisons, weakening his forces in the field, as Brissac hoped. Perennially short of cash from the king of France, Brissac held his troops together through the force of their loyalty to him. In 1554, he occupied the hilly district of Langhe and finished his campaign with the conquest of Ivrea, which opened a route for the auxiliary Swiss forces. In 1555, by a daring move, he surprised and took Casale, where the nobles of the Imperial forces, gathered for a festive tourney, had barely time to fortify themselves in the citadel. Brissac, forbidding his troops to pillage the city, secured the capitulation of the fortress and all its armaments, and paid his soldiers through the ransom of their captives. Henri II made a present of his own sword to Brissac.\n\nThese and other episodes of his military role were recounted by François de Boivin. His portrait, attributed to Corneille de Lyon, is conserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nHe married Charlotte Le Sueur d'Esquetot and had four children. His younger son was Charles II de Cossé, Duke of Brissac, who was the first Duke of Brissac. This son headed forces loyal to the Catholic League during the French Wars of Religion.\n"}

Initially thought to be an accident, it was later deemed a terrorist attack by the Israel Police.\n\nTwo Palestinians confessed to the attack; a third, who stole from Asher's body, was convicted of theft.\n\nAsher and Yonatan Palmer () were from the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba in the West Bank. Asher Palmer's parents are American immigrants to Israel, and he held US citizenship through them. He did his national service in the Israel Defense Forces as part of the hesder program, combining military service with religious studies, doing his service in the Israeli Navy, and was discharged several months before his death. At the time of his death, he was studying at the Jerusalem College of Engineering. After his death, the college started a scholarship fund named after him and his son dedicated to helping religious students support their families while studying. His infant son, Yonatan, who was killed with him, was two days short of his first birthday.\n\nAsher Palmer's wife, Puah, is a nurse at Shaare Zedek Medical Center, and was pregnant at the time of his death. She gave birth to a girl five months after the attack.\n\nAsher and Yonatan Palmer were travelling by car along Highway 60 near Kiryat Arba to join Palmer's pregnant wife in Jerusalem. Two Palestinians hurled stones from their car which caused the death of Asher Palmer and his son after their car overturned. Asher Palmer's face was crushed in the lip region and he sustained fractures to his skull.\n\nAfter the attack, a Palestinian driver, Shehada Awad Shehada Shatat, was driving on Highway 60 and observed the attack and car crash. He did not call for medical aid or attempt to help the victims but stole Asher's handgun from his body. The family of Asher and Yonatan Palmer stated that Asher's wallet was also stolen.\n\nThe police initially believed the deaths of Asher Palmer and his son were accidental and a result of driver error. However, they later concluded that the deaths were caused by rocks thrown at their vehicle and classified the incident as a terror attack. The Defense Ministry stated that the dead would be recognized as terror victims.\n\nThe attack was investigated by a Hebron District police force that dealt with incidents of rocks being hurled at Israeli vehicles from moving cars, this being the 18th case of such attacks. Investigators found a hole in the car's windshield consistent with a rock's entry point. Three rocks were found in the car, and one of them blood-stained, analysis determining that it was human blood. The fractures to Palmer's skull and facial injuries were also assessed and an autopsy on Asher Palmer's body revealed injuries consistent with rock projectile.\nThe police were criticized for their initial report of the attack. Settlement leaders said that the police had denied that this was a terror attack to maintain the public order. Minister of the Knesset, Michael Ben Ari, said that the police were fearful of violent protests and the brother-in-law of Asher, Aharon Peretz suggested that the police did not describe this as a terror attack so as not to \"fan the flames\" and said of Asher, \"He never fought with anyone. He was a quiet and special man and this is a great loss.\"\n\nThe mayor of Kiryat Arba, Malachi Levinger, called on the security forces to stop the stone-throwing which endangered lives. He said, \"There are tens of thousands of Jews driving to Hebron to pray these days, and their safety must be protected,\" Danny Dayan demanded the publication of the report saying the public, the media or the bereaved family had not been informed of the true events and that the murder had been covered up.\n\nMany people assembled in a parking lot in Kiryat Arba pay their respects to the deceased. After the eulogies finished, the bodies of Asher and Yonatan, wrapped in a tiny prayer shawl, were carried by mourners to a vehicle in which they were transported to Hebron for burial.\n\nTwo Palestinian men from Halhul, Wa'al al-Arjeh and Ali Saadeh, were arrested for the murders of Asher and Yonatan Palmer following an investigation by the Israel Police, Shin Bet, and the IDF. They admitted to hurling the rock which caused the deaths. The rock was thrown at the victims' car from a vehicle speeding in the opposite direction, thereby significantly increasing the force of impact.\n\nAfter police examined the possibility that the two were responsible for 17 other cases involving stones being hurled at Israeli vehicles and the prosecution, the prosecution indicted the men for other stone-throwing attacks, one of them who was charged with attempted murder in another case, in which he allegedly threw rocks at a bus to kill passengers. Three other Palestinian men were indicted in connection to the Palmers' deaths who allegedly formed cell to target Israeli civilians.\n\nMonitors from the US State Department attended pre-trial hearings of the suspects at the Ofer Military Court, and representatives from the US Department of Justice and State Department attended the trial, due to the victims having American citizenship.\n\nAsher Palmer's brother, Moshe, said, \"I have never felt the need for revenge but I'm glad they were arrested\", he added. \"Why they did what they did – is no great secret. It doesn't make the pain any easier, but it's good that a relatively short time after the incident, they managed to apprehend the people. I believe that those responsible for catching these people have done their job properly.\"\n\nOn 24 April 2013, Arjeh was convicted by a penel of 3 judges of intentional murder and sentenced to two life terms and an additional 58 years.\n\nShehada Awad Shehada Shatat was convicted of stealing Palmer's gun moments immediately after his death and received a 10- month prison sentence and a NIS 1,000 fine. The prosecution appealed against the leniency of the sentence. Asher Palmer's father, Michael, said that military court had ignored the rights of the victims as he had not been informed of the sentencing hearing and consequently did not provide a victim impact statement for the court to assess. He said, \"Shatat saw the attack, saw Asher and Yonatan die, maintained chilling presence of mind as he looked into the just-dead faces of a father and his infant son and then proceeded to desecrate Asher's still warm body to find and steal the weapon. Shatat may very well have literally had Asher's blood on his hands.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeals later considered the victim impact statements and increased the sentence to 15 months imprisonment.\n\nIn September 2012, a year after the Palmer deaths, a memorial ceremony was held near Jerusalem, attended by U.S. and Canadian diplomats, to add the names of Asher and Yonatan Palmer to a wall commemorating the 300 Americans and Canadians that have been killed in terrorist attacks and Israel's battles. A vineyard was dedicated to Asher and Yonatan on the anniversary of their death and a children's playground in being built in his memory.\n\nThe deaths have been used as examples during definition of security offenses in the policy change of integration laws.\n\nThe Palmer incident was used as the basis for building a defense wall in nearby roads. The IDF stated said policies and rules had been changed as a result of the event.\n\nThe trial was unusual, because the Office of the Military Advocate does not usually seek murder convictions in stone-throwing incidents, but in this case both the Military advocate charged the rock-thrower, Wa'al al-Arjeh, with murder and the three-judge panel convicted al-Arjeh of intentional murder.\n\n"}
{"id": "330821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330821", "title": "Dongxiangs", "text": "Dongxiangs\n\nThe Dongxiang people (autonym: \"Sarta\" or \"Santa\" (撒尔塔); ; Xiao'erjing: دْوݣسِيْاݣذُ) are one of 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. Most of the Dongxiang live in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture and surrounding areas of Gansu Province in northwestern China. According to the 2010 census, their population numbers 621,500.\n\nThe Dongxiang are closely related to other Mongolic peoples like the Monguor and Bonan. Scholars speculate that their identity as an independent ethnic group arose through contact with Central Asians, due to whom the Dongxiang converted to Sunni Islam in the 13th century.\n\nThey are believed to be descendants of Mongolian troops posted in the Hezhou area by Genghis Khan (1162-1227 AD) during his journey westward, mixed with Sarts from Central Asia. Another possibility is that they could be a mixture of many peoples including Mongolian, Han, and Tibetan groups.\n\nThe American Asiatic Association published an account of the Dongxiang's origins in the \"Asia, Volume 40\". A Muslim Mongol, Ma Chuanyuan, who was the supermagistrate of five districts, was interviewed, and gave a story on his people's origins. The conversion to Islam by a clan descended from Genghis Khan angered their relatives, who drove them all the way to Eastern Linxia. This occurred at the twilight of the Yuan dynasty. East Linxia was described as a land of \"thorns and yellow earth\". The author estimated a number of 100,000 Mongolian Muslims. They spoke Mongolian but were all illiterate. The account described them as a community of one hundred thousand, Mongol by race, Islam by religion and Chinese by culture. The majority of them were monolingual.\n\nDongxiang were also known as Santa (San-t'a) people, it was reported that many of them served in the army of the Hui General Ma Fuxiang. It was even said that Ma Fuxiang himself was of Santa descent, who had assimilated into the Hui community.\n\nTheir autonym, \"sarta\", may also provide a contradictory clue to their origin: a similar word \"Sart\" was formerly used in Central Asia to refer to Arab traders, later to the local (mostly) Turkic-speaking city dwellers. Their official name of Dōngxiāng meaning \"eastern villages\" stems from the fact that their settlements are east of the major Han Chinese settlements.\n\nLike other Muslims in China, the Dongxiang served extensively in the Chinese military. It was said that they and the Salars were given to \"eating rations\", a reference to military service.\n\nDongxiang, Baoan, and Hui troops served under Generals Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang in the Boxer Rebellion, defeating the invading Eight Nation Alliance at the Battle of Langfang. Ma Fulu along with 100 Dongxiang and Hui troops died in fierce combat at Zhengyang Gate in Beijing against the Alliance forces as they fought to the death to hold the Alliance at bay.\n\nDongxiang, Baoan, Hui, Salar, and Tibetan troops served under Ma Biao in the Second Sino-Japanese War against the Japanese.\n\nThe Dongxiang have Mongol, Han Chinese, Hui, and Tibetan surnames. Dongxiang with Han Chinese surnames such as Wang, Kang, Zhang, Gao, and Huang claim descent from Han Chinese. Those with surnames such as Ma and Mu are descended from Hui.\n\nMany of the Muslim descendants of Confucius are descended from the marriage of Ma Jiaga (马甲尕), a Muslim woman, and Kong Yanrong (孔彦嵘), 59th generation descendant of Confucius in the year 1480 and their descendants are found among the Hui and Dongxiang peoples.\n\nSome Dongxiang have said that, in the rare instances that they do marry with other people, it is only with Hui and Han, but not Tibetans.\n\nA town called Tangwangchuan (唐汪川) in Gansu had a multiethnic populace, the Tang () and Wang () families being the two major families. The Tang and Wang families were originally of non-Muslim Han Chinese extraction, but by the 1900s some branches of the families became Muslim by \"intermarriage or conversion\", while other branches of the families remained non-Muslim. People in the area have changed their ethnicity by marrying members of other groups or converting to their religion. The Tang and Wang families are now composed of all three different ethnic groups, with Han Chinese, Hui, and Dongxiang people. The Dongxiang and Hui are Muslims. Tangwangchuan and Hanjiaji were notable for being the lone towns with a multiethnic community, with both non-Muslims and Muslims.\n\nThe cuisines of various ethnicities have spread across boundaries in the area of Hehuang, with different groups such as Mongolians, Tibetan, Dongxiang, and Hui eating each other's cuisines, such as mutton and milk tea.\n\nThe base of the economy of Dongxiang is agriculture. The main products are potatoes, maize and wheat. They are also recognized craftsmen, specializing in the elaboration of traditional carpets.\n\nThe Dongxiang speak the Dongxiang language, a member of the Mongolic family. The Dongxiang people also have a rich tradition of oral literature, and use the Arabic alphabet.\n\nAs a result of the language shift, some 20,000 people in several villages in the northeastern Dongxiang County now speak the so-called \"Tangwang language\": a creolized version of Mandarin Chinese with a strong Dongxiang influence, in particular in its grammar.\n\nGovernment statistics show that the Dongxiang are among the poorest and least literate of China's minorities, with most Dongxiang having completed only an average of 1.1 years of schooling, a problem aggravated by the lack of a written language.\n\nIn 2004, the Ford Foundation provided US$30,000 in grant money for a pilot project to promote bilingual education in Dongxiang and Mandarin, in an effort to reduce school drop-out rates. The project is credited with the publication of a Dongxiang-Chinese bilingual dictionary as well as recent rises in test scores.\n\nThe East Asian O3-M122 Y chromosome Haplogroup is found in large quantities in other Muslims close to the Hui like Dongxiang, Bo'an and Salar. The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese, and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Eastern and Europeans whom the Muslims of China are not related to, East Asians, Han Chinese, and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations converted to Islam and were culturally assimilated to these ethnicities and that Chinese Muslim populations are mostly not descendants of foreigners as claimed by some accounts while only a small minority of them are.\n\n\n"}

They wrote a number of books on sexuality and eroticism, and they also amassed a collection of erotic art, which traveled around Europe in 1968 as the \"First International Exhibition of Erotic Art\" and then found a home in San Francisco as the Museum of Erotic Art (1970-1973).\n\nEberhard Kronhausen was born on September 12, 1915. He was brought up in Europe and “had firsthand experience of Nazi Germany”. Phyllis was born in 1929 in the USA. The Kronhausens met in 1954 at the University of Minnesota, where Phyllis, then 25, was an undergraduate studying business, and Eberhard, at the relatively late age of 39, was getting a Masters in psychology.\n\nUpon graduating from Minnesota they moved together to New York, where Phyllis enrolled in the program in “Marriage and Family Life Education” at the Teachers’ College of Columbia University, which allowed her to take courses also at other New York universities. Eberhard followed suit two years later, and both graduated with Doctor of Education degrees in that program (Phyllis graduating in 1956 and Eberhard in 1958). They also studied psychoanalysis at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis, founded by Dr. Theodor Reik to provide for analytic training of non-medical students. Upon graduation they moved to San Diego, where they were both licensed to practice psychotherapy. \n\nIn 1959, they published their first book, \"Pornography and the law: The psychology of erotic realism and pornography\". This would be the first of a long line of sex-related books. \"Pornography and the Law\" made a distinction between \"frankly pornographic writings\" and \"serious\" (but not necessarily less erotic) writings, such as the works of Henry Miller or D.H. Lawrence. In 1960 Phyllis Kronhausen testified in a California obscenity case, involving a series of soft core erotic writings. According to the Kronhausens, \"her testimony resulted in an acquittal of the defense, saving the author and publisher of these truly harmless books many years in jail.\"\n\n\"Pornography and the Law\" was followed in 1960 by \"Sex Histories of American College Men\", a book based on Phyllis Kronhausen's experience as a lecturer in \"health education\" at a men's college in the Northeastern U.S. (which is not named). One of Kronhausen's course requirements had been for her students to complete a \"personal history\" in which they described sexual memories and experiences.\n\nAfter publishing \"Pornography and the law\", the Kronhausens began to acquire a collection of erotic art. This brought them to Europe, where they were active during the 1960s. As they reminisced in 1978:\n\nIt so happened that from 1960 on we came to spend more and more time in Europe, first on psychological consultation and later because we felt that we had both been spending too much time in the same cultural environment and needed a change for our own personal development.\n\nIn Europe we collected more erotic art, our most notable discoveries from the beginning of that period being the Dutch painter Melle in Amsterdam, the German painter Hans Bellmer, the Trieste-born artist Leonor Fini, and the French surrealist André Masson in Paris.\n\n[...] We had occasion, in fact, to watch the transformation of pornography into art before our own eyes when Hans Bellmer one day worked in our presence, making a complicated and highly erotic engraving from a series of common pornographic photographs.\n\nTheir books were translated into German and French starting in the late 1960s.\n\nThey organized the “First International Exhibition of Erotic Art\" at a public museum in Lund, Sweden in 1968 – overcoming a lot of institutional resistance. They even succeeded in having the public poster for the show feature a graphic representation of sexual intercourse.\n\nIn relation to that show they published the two-volume art book \"Erotic Art\" in 1968 and 1969, featuring illustrations of erotic art from different periods of time and different cultures. This would lead to other picture books such as \"Erotic Book Plates\" (1970), \"The International Museum of Erotic Art\" (1973), and \"Behind Closed Doors : A Marriage Manual\" (1979). The latter was not really a manual but rather a book of nearly 2,000 black and white photographs without text, featuring a real French husband & wife couple having sex in a variety of positions, in every room of their home including the hallway and stairs. (The photography was by Robin Schwartz, a woman who was a friend of the couple.)\n\nThe collection went on to find a home in San Francisco, as the Museum of Erotic Art, which existed from 1970 to 1973, on Powell Street in downtown.\n\nIn 1978 the Kronhausens were featured in \"Hustler\" magazine, with a piece on the Bible's Book of Genesis, illustrated with a series of erotic paintings. \"What poor, sick, twisted guilt-ridden, neurotic mind first conjured up a sexless Garden of Eden?\" the article begins. The Kronhausens then argue that the Bible has been misunderstood, and that the story of Adam and Eve is not about the discovery of sin, but about the loss of innocent enjoyment of sex - \"and with it the appearance of false shame where none is called for, and needless guilt where no evil has been committed.\" The paintings that illustrate the article were said by the Kronhausens to be by an anonymous artist and dated to 1850-1900, but could well be 1970s imitations of 19th century art, and are not necessarily about the Garden of Eden.\n\nOn March 31, 1979 the Kronhausens sold their erotic art collection at an auction in New York City. The collection fetched a fairly low price. \"In general bidding wasn't feverish,\" reported \"New York Magazine\". \"On the evidence of other auction sales, it seems that New Yorkers harbor more lust for Sheffield silver than for images of other people lusting. [...] The Drs. Kronhausen were apparently drawn most often to a major style of the 1960s - the look of high-contrast black-and-white photography joined to hot, buzzing billboard colors. That was a liberated style for about two seasons. Now yesterday's liberation has been turned into the liquidity of today.\"\n\nOne reason for the sale was that, starting in the late 1970s, the Kronhausens had turned to New Age spirituality. They were living at that time in California, and came into contact with the teachings of the Indian-born theosophist and spiritual director Jiddu Krishnamurti, at his American headquarters in the New Age hotspot of Ojai, near Los Angeles. They watched many of Krishnamurti's talks at the video library there. \n\nIn the 1980s and 90s they became involved in nutrition, creating a diet called \"Formula for Life\" which they publicised through a book of that title (1989). They advocated abstinence from red meat and therapeutic megadoses of Vitamin C. They also advocated for nutritional supplements such as glutathione. \n\nAt the turn of the millennium they became involved in Buddhist philosophy and psychology. They attempted to apply the result of these studies to the fields of history, politics, and psychotherapy in their last book, \"Staying Sane in a Crazy World\" (2008) – a print on demand book sold by Amazon.com. \n\nEberhard died at the age of 94 on December 5, 2009.\n\nEberhard Kronhausen was thanked in the album \"Freak Out!\" (1966) by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention.\n\n\n\"Unless otherwise noted, all titles are by Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated in History at the Sorbonne, earning a diploma of higher studies in history in 1963.\n\nA communist in his teenage years, François Duprat moved to the far right and became a member of the Jeune Nation wing of the French nationalist students' federation (\"Fédération des étudiants nationalistes\" FEN). Strongly opposed to Algerian independence during the Algerian War (1954–62), Duprat later supported Arab states as an anti-Zionist. After the March 1962 Evian agreements granting independence to Algeria, he traveled to Katanga, supporting the secession led by Moise Tshombe. He became Tshome's Director of Propaganda on Radio-Katanga.\n\nThereafter, he returned to France, where he became a member of Occident, which carried out street brawls against the Maoists and other left-wing students. However, he was excluded in 1967, accused of being a police informant. Duprat then took part in the Ordre Nouveau movement (New Order), and became the editor of \"L'Action européenne\" (European Action) and of the \"Revue d’histoire du fascisme\" (History Review of Fascism), which introduced in France Holocaust denial thesis supported by far right circles in the English-world.\n\nIn 1972, François Duprat co-founded the National Front (FN) headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen, and was part of its political bureau until his death in 1978. He represented the hard-liners of the party, and directed the \"Groupes nationalistes révolutionnaires\" (National Revolutionary Groups), alongside Alain Renault.\n\nFrançois Duprat saw history as a political weapon, stating in May 1976:\n\nWe must not let to our opponents, Marxists and \"régimistes\", the monopoly of the historical representation of men, facts and ideas. Because History is a wonderful war instrument, and it would be useless to deny that one of the important reasons of our political hardships resides in the historical exploitation and the systematic deformation of the nationalist experiences of the past... It is in order to answer these needs... that a team of intellectuals, professors and nationalists have created the \"Revue d'histoire du fascisme.\"\" \n\nDuprat wrote a book on far right movements in France from 1940 to 1944, during the Collaborationist regime of Vichy. He also created a number of magazines and political reviews, including the \"Cahiers d'histoire du fascisme\" (History Notebooks on Fascism) and the \"Cahiers Européens-Notre Europe\" (European Notebooks - Our Europe), which also circulated denialist books or far right literature exalting the Third Reich.\n\nDuprat was killed on 18 March 1978, in a car-bomb explosion. His wife Jeanine was also injured in the attack, losing the use of her legs. He was finishing a book titled \"Argent et politique\" (Money and Politics) concerning the funding of right-wing and far-right political parties. There are many theories about the assassination, but historian Michel Winock notes that perpetrators and their motives have never been established; the police investigation into his assassination was inconclusive.\n\nA Jewish \"Remembrance Commando\" and a \"Jewish Revolutionary Group\" immediately claimed responsibility for the murder. The perpetrators of the bombing were never found, while Jean-Pierre Bloch, director of the LICRA anti-racist NGO, condemned the killing.\n\nIn \"Génération Occident: de l'extrême droite à la droite\", Frédéric Charpier alleged that the assassination could have been commissioned by a rival far right organisation. He recalled that Duprat had been excluded in 1967 from Occident after allegations that he was a police informant. According to Roger Faligot and Pascal Krop, Duprat was killed for his links with Palestinians and Syrians.\n\nShortly before the assassination, Patrice Chairoff had published names and addresses of publishers which were tied to Duprat; one of the addresses happened to be his private residence.\nHis funeral at the church of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet was attended by the leading lights of the nationalist right, which included the National Front, the PFN, monarchists and right-wing solidarists.\n\n\"Le National\", a far right political review, honoured him in April 1978 as one of the French leaders of \"the 'revisionist' historical school\" who had introduced in France \"one of the most explosive booklets\" of Richard Harwood, member of the British National Front and author of the negationist pamphlet \"Did Six Million Really Die?\" The \"Cahiers européens – Notre Europe\" diffused this pamphlet starting in February 1976. The anonymous author of this text had been identified by Pierre-André Taguieff as likely being André Delaporte.\n\nEach year Jean-Marie Le Pen pays his respects at Duprat's gravesite at the cimetière de Montmartre. At the 30th anniversary of his death, LePen paid tribute to his being a \"martyr to the cause of freedom of thought\", \"a fighter\", and \"politician right to the tips of his fingers\".\n"}

Gujaratis are very prominent in industry and key figures played a historic role in the introduction of the doctrine of Swaraj and the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Gujarati people are descended from Aryan nomads who rose in the fertile valleys of the Indus River in 2000 BC and settled in Gujarat.\n\nAlbeit with huge migration for economic reasons, most Gujaratis in India live in the state of Gujarat in Western India. Gujaratis also form a significant part of the populations in the neighboring metropolis of Mumbai and union territories of Daman and Diu, and Dadra Nagar Haveli, both being former Portuguese colonies. There are very large Gujarati immigrant communities in other parts of India, most notably in Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore and other metropolitan areas like Kollam and Kochi in Kerala. All throughout history Gujaratis have earned a reputation as being India's greatest merchants, industrialists and business entrepreneurs, and have therefore been at forefront of migrations all over the world, particularly to regions that were part of the British empire such as Fiji, Hong Kong, New Zealand, East Africa and countries in Southern Africa. Diasporas and transnational networks in many of these countries date back to more than a century. In recent decades, larger numbers of Gujaratis have migrated to English speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nBetween 1790-1, an epidemic devastated numerous parts of Gujarat during which 100,000 Gujaratis were killed in Surat alone.\n\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague in 1812 has been claimed to have killed about half the Gujarati population.\nEarly European travelers like Ludovico di Varthema (15th century) traveled to Gujarat and wrote on the people of Gujarat. He noted that Jainism had a strong presence in Gujarat and opined that Gujaratis were deprived of their kingdom by Mughals because of their kind heartedness. His description of Gujaratis was:\n\nOrthodox Gujarati society which was mercantile by nature, was historically organized along ethno-religious lines and shaped into existence on the strength of its Mahajan (\"guild assemblies\"), and for its institution of Nagarsheth (\"head of the guild assembly\"); a 16th-century Mughal system akin to medieval European guilds which self-regulated the mercantile affairs of multi-ethnic, multi-religious communities in the Gujarati bourgeoisie long before municipal state politics was introduced. Historically, Gujaratis belonging to numerous faiths and castes, thrived in an inclusive climate surcharged by a degree of cultural syncretism, in which Hindus and Jains dominated occupations such as shroffs and brokers whereas, Muslims, Hindus and Parsis largely dominated sea shipping trade. This led to religious interdependence, tolerance, assimilation and community cohesion ultimately becoming the hallmark of modern-day Gujarati society.\n\nThe Gujarati people are predominantly Hindu. There are also significant populations of Jains and Muslims, and minor populations of Buddhists, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians\n\nThe major communities in Gujarat are the traditional Agriculturalist such as Patel, Ahir, Bharvad, and Rabari, Artisan communities (Gurjar, Prajapati, Sindhi Mochi), Brahmin communities (such as Anavil, Nagar, Modh), Farming communities (such as Choudhary Jats and Koli people, Genealogist communities (such as Charans and Barots), Kshatriya communities (such as Koli Thakor, Banushali, Kathi Darbars, Karadia, Chudasama, Maher), Parsi Community, Tribal communities (such as Bhils, Meghwal and Kolis) and Vaishya (such as Bhatia, Lohana, Soni).\n\nThe major Gujarati Muslim communities include Bhadala, Daudi Bohra, Memon, Khoja, Sayyid, Siddhi and Vahora.\n\nGujaratis have a long tradition of seafaring and a history of overseas migration to foreign lands, to Yemen Oman Bahrain, Kuwait, Zanzibar and other countries in the Persian Gulf since a mercantile culture resulted naturally from the state's proximity to the Arabian Sea. The countries with the largest Gujarati populations are Pakistan, United Kingdom, United States, Canada and many countries in Southern and East Africa. Globally, Gujaratis are estimated to comprise around 33% of the Indian diaspora worldwide and can be found in 129 of 190 countries listed as sovereign nations by the United Nations. Non Resident Gujaratis (NRGs) maintain active links with the homeland in the form of business, remittance, philanthropy, and through their political contribution to state governed domestic affairs.\n\nGujarati parents in the diaspora are not comfortable with the possibility of their language not surviving them. In a study, 80% of Malayali parents felt that \"children would be better off with English\", compared to 36% of Kannada parents and only 19% of Gujarati parents.\n\nThere is a community of Gujarati Muslims mainly settled in the Pakistani province of Sindh for generations. Community leaders say there are 3,000,000 speakers of Gujarati language in Karachi. A sizable number migrated after the Partition of India and subsequent creation of independent Pakistan in 1947. These Pakistani Gujaratis belong mainly to the Ismāʿīlī, Khoja, Dawoodi Bohra, Chundrigar, Charotar Sunni Vohra, Muslim Ghanchi, Muslim Khatri and Memon groups; however, many Gujaratis are also a part of Pakistan's small but vibrant Hindu community. Famous Gujaratis of Pakistan include Muhammed Ali Jinnah (father of Pakistan), Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar (sixth Prime Minister of Pakistan), Sir Adamjee Haji Dawood (philanthropist), Abu Bakr Osman Mitha (Major-General), Abdul Razzak Yaqoob (philanthropist), Javed Miandad (Pakistani cricketer), Abdul Sattar Edhi (humanitarian), Jehangir H. Kothari (philanthropist), Abdul Gaffar Billoo (philanthropist), Sarfraz Ahmed(Pakistani cricketer), Ramzan Chhipa (philanthropist), Tapu Javeri (Pakistani fashion and art photographer), Pervez Hoodbhoy (Pakistani nuclear physicist) and Ardeshir Cowasjee (Pakistani critic and social activist).\n\nThe United States has the second-largest Gujarati population after Pakistan. The highest concentration of the population of over 100,000 is in the New York City Metropolitan Area alone, notably in the growing Gujarati diasporic center of India Square in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Edison in Middlesex County in Central New Jersey. Significant immigration from India to the United States started after the landmark Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Early immigrants after 1965 were highly educated professionals. Since US immigration laws allow sponsoring immigration of parents, children and particularly siblings on the basis of family reunion, the numbers rapidly swelled in a phenomenon known as \"chain migration\".A number of Gujarati are twice or thrice-migrant because they came directly from the former British colonies of East Africa or from East Africa via Great Britain respectively Given the Gujarati propensity for business enterprise, a number of them opened shops and motels. Now in the 21st century over 40% of the hospitality industry in the United States is controlled by Gujaratis. Gujaratis, especially the Patidar samaj, also dominate as franchisees of fast food restaurant chains such as Subway and Dunkin' Donuts. The descendants of the Gujarati immigrant generation have also made high levels of advancement into professional fields, including as physicians, engineers and politicians. In August 2016, Air India commenced single aircraft (no transfer) flight service between Ahmedabad and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, via London Heathrow International Airport.\n\nNotable Gujarati Americans include Ami Bera (United States Congress), Reshma Saujani (American politician), Sonal Shah (economist to Whitehouse), Raj Shah (White House Deputy Press Secretary under President Trump), Rohit Vyas (Indian American journalist), \nBharat Desai (CEO Syntel), Vyomesh Joshi (Forbes), Romesh Wadhwani (Forbes), Raj Bhavsar (sports) Halim Dhanidina (first Muslim judge of California), Savan Kotecha (Grammy nominated American songwriter), and Hollywood actresses, Sheetal Sheth and Noureen DeWulf.\n\nGujaratis have had a long involvement with Britain. The original East India Company set up a factory (trading post) in the port city of Surat in Gujarat in 1615. These were the beginnings of first real British involvement with India that eventually led to the formation of the British Raj.\nThe third largest overseas diaspora of Gujaratis, after Pakistan and United States, is in the UK. At a population of around 600,000 Gujaratis form almost half of the Indian community who live in the UK (1.2 million). Gujaratis first went to the UK in the 19th century with the establishment of the British Raj in India. Prominent members of this community such as Shyamji Krishna Varma played a vital role in exerting political pressure upon colonial powers during the Indian independence movement.\n\nThe present day Gujarati diaspora in the UK is mostly the second and third generation descendants of \"twice-over\" immigrants from the former British colonies of East Africa, Portugal, and Indian Ocean Islands. Most of them despite being British Subjects had restricted access to Britain after successive Immigration acts of 1962, 1968 and 1971. Most were, however, eventually admitted on the basis of a Quota voucher system or, in case of Uganda, as refugees after the expulsion order by the Ugandan ruler, Idi Amin in August 1972.\nGujaratis in Britain are regarded as affluent middle-class peoples who have assimilated into the milieu of British society. They are celebrated for revolutionizing the corner shop, and energising the British economy which changed Britain's antiquated retail laws forever. Demographically, Hindus form a majority along with a significant number of Jains and Muslims, and smaller numbers of Gujarati Christians. They are predominantly settled in metropolitan areas like Greater London, East Midlands, West Midlands, Lancashire and Yorkshire. Cities with significant Gujarati populations include Leicester and London boroughs of Brent, Barnet, Harrow and Wembley. There is also a small, but vibrant Gujarati-speaking Parsi community of Zoroastrians present in the country, dating back to the bygone era of Dadabhai Navroji, Shapurji Saklatvala and Pherozeshah Mehta. Both Hindus and Muslims have established caste or community associations, temples, and mosques to cater for the needs of their respective communities. A well known temple popular with Gujaratis is the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Neasdon, London. A popular mosque that caters for the Gujarati Muslim community in Leicester is the Masjid Umar. Leicester has a Jain Temple that is also the headquarters of Jain Samaj Europe. The Shree Prajapati Association is a charity, already thriving in East Africa, which has 13 branches in the U.K. and is strongly dependent on support from the Gujarati community in Britain.\nGujarati Hindus in the UK have maintained many traditions from their homeland. The community remains religious with more than 100 temples catering for their religious needs. All major Hindu festivals such as Navratri, Dassara, and Diwali are celebrated with a lot of enthusiasm even from the generations brought up in UK. Gujarati Hindus also maintain their caste affiliation to some extent with most major castes having their own community association in each population center with significant Gujarati population such as Leicester and London suburbs. Patidars form the largest community in the diaspora including Kutch Leva Patels, followed closely by Lohanas of Saurashtra origin. Gujarati Rajputs from various regional backgrounds are affiliated with several independent British organizations dependant on caste such as Shree Maher Samaj UK, and the Gujarati Arya Kshatriya Mahasabha-UK.\n\nEndogamy remains important to Gujarati Muslims in UK with the existence of matrimonial services specifically dedicated to their community. Gujarati Muslim society in the UK have kept the custom of Jamat Bandi, literally meaning communal solidarity. This system is the traditional expression of communal solidarity. It is designed to regulate the affairs of the community and apply sanctions against infractions of the communal code. Gujarati Muslim communities, such as the Ismāʿīlī, Khoja, Dawoodi Bohra, Sunni Bohra, and Memon have caste associations, known as jamats that run mosques and community centers for their respective communities.\n\nIndia becoming the predominant IT powerhouse in the 1990s has led to waves of new immigration by Gujaratis, and other Indians with software skills to the UK.\n\nTwo Gujarati business communities, the Palanpuri Jains and the Kathiawadi Patels from Surat, have come to dominate the diamond industry of Belgium. They have largely displaced the Orthodox Jewish community which previously dominated this industry in Belgium.\n\nCanada, just like its southern neighbour, is home to a large Gujarati community. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, there are 118,950 Gujaratis of various religious backgrounds living in Canada. The majority of them live in Toronto and its suburbs - home to the second largest Gujarati community in North America after the New York Metropolitan Area. Gujarati Hindus are the second largest linguistic/religious group in Canada's Indian community after Punjabi Sikhs, and Toronto is home to the largest Navratri raas garba festival in North America. The Ismaili Khoja form a significant part of the Canadian diaspora estimated to be about 80,000 in numbers overall. Most of them arrived in Canada in the 1970s as immigrants from Uganda and other countries of East Africa.\n\nNotable Gujarati Canadians include Bharat Masrani (CEO of TD Bank Group), Zain Verjee (CNN journalist), Ali Velshi (former CNN, current MSNBC journalist), Rizwan Manji (Canadian actor), Avan Jogia (Canadian actor), Richie Mehta (Canadian film director), Nazneen Contractor (Canadian actress), Ishu Patel (BAFTA-winning Animations director), Arif Virani (Member of Parliament for Parkdale-High Park), Rahim Jaffer (Member of Parliament for Edmonton-Strathcona), Naheed Nenshi (36th Mayor of Calgary), Omar Sachedina (CTV News anchor) and Prashant Pathak (Investor and Philanthropist).\n\nFormer British colonies in East Africa had many residents of South Asian descent. The primary immigration was mainly from Gujarat and to a lesser extent from Punjab. They were brought there by the British Empire from India to do clerical work in Imperial service, or unskilled/semi-skilled manual labour such as construction or farm work. In the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were brought to the then British East African colonies under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the Uganda Railway that started in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa and ended in Kisumu on Kenyan side of Lake Victoria. Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 individuals decided to remain in the African Great Lakes after the line's completion.\n\nMany Asians, particularly the Gujarati, in these regions were in the trading businesses. They included Gujaratis of all religions as well many of the castes and Quoms. Since the representation of Indians in these occupations was high, stereotyping of Indians in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyka as shopkeepers was common. A number of people worked for the British run banks. They also worked in skilled labor occupations, as managers, teachers and administrators. Gujarati and other South Asians had significant influence on the economy, constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income. For example, in Uganda, the Mehta and Madhvani families controlled the bulk of the manufacturing businesses. Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services. Additionally, the tariff system in Uganda had historically been oriented toward the economic interests of South Asian traders. One of the oldest Jain overseas diaspora was of Gujarat. Their number was estimated at 45,000 at the independence of the East African countries in the early 1960s. Most members of this community belonged to Gujarati speaking Halari Visa Oshwal Jain community originally from the Jamnagar area of Saurashtra.\n\nThe countries of East Africa gained independence from Britain in the early 1960s. At that time most Gujarati and other Asians opted to remain as British Subjects. The African politicians at that time accused Asians of economic exploitation and introduced a policy of Africanization. The 1968 Committee on \"Africanisation in Commerce and Industry\" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life. During the middle of the 1960s many Asians saw the writing on the wall and started moving either to UK or India. However, restrictive British immigration policies stopped a mass exodus of East African Asians until Idi Amin came to power in 1971. He exploited pre-existing Indophobia and spread propaganda against Indians involving stereotyping and scapegoating the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as \"only traders\" and \"inbred\" to their profession. Indians were labelled as \"dukawallas\" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time), and stereotyped as \"greedy, conniving\", without any racial identity or loyalty but \"always cheating, conspiring and plotting\" to subvert Uganda. Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of \"de-Indianization\", eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Indian minority.\n\nGujarati and other Indians started moving to the Kenya colony at the end of the 19th century when the British colonial authorities started opening up the country with the laying down of the Railways. A small colony of merchants, however, had existed on the port cities such Mombasa on the Kenyan coast for hundreds of years prior to that. The immigrants who arrived with the British were the first ones to open up businesses in rural Kenya a century ago. These Dukawalas or shopkeepers were mainly Gujarati (Mostly Jains and Hindus and a minority of Muslims). Over the following decades the population, mainly Gujarati but also a sizable number of Punjabi, increased in size. The population started declining after the independence of Kenya in the 1960s. At that time the majority of Gujaratis opted for British citizenship and eventually moved there, especially to cities like Leicester or London suburbs. Famous Kenyans of Gujarati heritage who contributed greatly to the development of East Africa include Thakkar Bapa, Manu Chandaria, Atul Shah, Baloobhai Patel, Bhimji Depar Shah (Forbes), Naushad Merali (Forbes), and Indian philanthropist, Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee, who played a large role in the development of modern-day Kenya during colonial rule.\n\nThere is a small community of people of Indian origin living in Uganda, but the community is far smaller than before 1972 when Ugandan ruler Idi Amin expelled most Asians, including Gujaratis. In the late 19th century, mostly Sikhs, were brought on three-year contracts, with the aid of Imperial British contractor Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee to build the Uganda Railway from Mombasa to Kisumu by 1901, and to Kampala by 1931. Some died, while others returned to India after the end of their contracts, but few chose to stay. They were joined by Gujarati traders called \"passenger Indians\", both Hindu and Muslim free migrants who came to serve the economic needs of the indentured labourers, and to capitalise on the economic opportunities.\n\nAfter the 1972 expulsion, most Indians and Gujaratis migrated to the United Kingdom. Due to the efforts of the Aga Khan, many Khoja Nizari Ismaili refugees from Uganda were offered asylum in Canada.\n\nIndians have a long history in Tanzania starting with the arrival of Gujarati traders in the 19th century. There are currently over 50,000 people of Indian origin in Tanzania. Many of them are traders and they control a sizeable portion of the Tanzanian economy. They came to gradually control the trade in Zanzibar. Many of the buildings constructed then still remain in Stone Town, the focal trading point on the island.\n\nThe Indian community in South Africa is more than a century old and is concentrated in and around the city of Durban. The vast majority of immigrant pioneer Gujaratis who came in the latter half of the 19th century were \"passenger Indians\" who paid for their own travel fare and means of transport to arrive and settle South Africa, in pursuit of fresh trade and career opportunities and as such were treated as British subjects, unlike the fate of a class of Indian indentured laborours who were transported to work on the sugarcane plantations of Natal Colony in dire conditions. Passenger Indians, who initially operated in Durban, expanded inland, to the South African Republic (Transvaal), establishing communities in settlements on the main road between Johannesburg and Durban. After wealthy Gujarati Muslim merchants began experiencing discrimination from repressive colonial legislation in Natal, they sought the help of one young lawyer, Mahatma Gandhi to represent the case of a Memon businessman. Umar Hajee Ahmed Jhaveri was consequently elected the first president of the South African Indian Congress.\n\nIndians have played an important role in the anti-apartheid movement of South Africa. Many were incarcerated alongside Nelson Mandela following the Rivonia Trial, and many became martyred fighting to end racial discrimination. Notable South African Indians of Gujarati heritage include Marxist freedom fighters such as Ahmed Timol (activist), Yusuf Dadoo (activist), Ahmed Kathrada (activist), Amina Cachalia (activist) and Dullah Omar (activist), as well as Ahmed Deedat (missionary), Imran Garda (Al Jazeera English) and Hashim Amla (cricketer).\n\nOman, holding a strategically important position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, has been the primary focus of trade and commerce for medieval Gujarati merchants for much of its glorious history and Gujaratis, along with various other ethnic groups, contributed to the rich dynamic culture, founding and settlement of its capital port city, Muscat. Some of the earliest Indian immigrants to settle in Oman were the Bhatias of Kutch, who have a powerful presence in Oman dating back to the 16th century. At the turn of the 19th century, Gujaratis wielded such immense political clout that Faisal bin Turki, the great-grandfather of the current ruler, spoke Gujarati and Swahili along with his native Arabic and Oman's sultan Syed Said (1791-1856) was persuaded to shift his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar, more than two thousand miles from the Arabian mainland, on the recommendation of Shivji Topan and Bhimji families who lent money to the Sultan. In modern times, business tycoon Kanaksi Khimji, from the famous Khimji family of Gujarat was conferred title of Sheikh by the Sultan, the first ever use of the title for a member of the Hindu community. The Muscati Mahajan is one of the oldest merchants associations founded more than a century ago.\n\nGujaratis had a flourishing trade with Southeast Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries, and played a pivotal role in establishing Islam in the region. Miller (2010) presented a theory that the indigenous scripts of Sumatra (Indonesia), Sulawesi (Indonesia) and the Philippines are descended from an early form of the Gujarati script. Tomé Pires reported a presence of a thousand Gujaratis in Malacca (Malaysia) prior to 1512.Gujarati language continues to be spoken in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThere estimated around 31,500 Gujarati in Malaysia. Most of this community work as traders and settled in urban part of Malaysia like Georgetown, Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh.\n\nGujarati food has famously been described as \"the haute cuisine of vegetarianism\" and meals have a subtle balance of sweet, tart and mild hot sensations on the palate. Gujarati Jains, many Hindus and Buddhist in Gujarat are vegetarian. However, many Gujaratis such as Hindu Rajputs, Christians, and Muslims have traditionally eaten a variety of meats and seafood, although Muslims don't eat pork and Hindus don't eat beef. Gujarati cuisine follows the traditional Indian full meal structure of rice, cooked vegetables, lentil dal or curry and \"roti\". The different types of flatbreads that a Gujarati cooks are rotli or chapati, bhakhri, thepla or dhebara, puri, maal purah, and puran-pohli. Popular snacks such as Khaman, Dhokla, Pani Puri, Dhokli, dal-dhokli, Undhiyu, Jalebi, fafda, chevdoh, Samosa, papri chaat, Muthia, Bhajia, Patra, bhusu, locho, sev , fafda gathiya, vanela gathiya and Sev mamra are traditional Gujarati dishes savoured by many communities across the world.\n\nKhichdi – a mix of rice and mung dal, cooked with spice – is a popular and nutritious dish which has regional variations. Quite often the khichdi is accompanied by Kadhi. It is found satisfying by most Gujaratis, and cooked very regularly in most homes, typically on a busy day due to its ease of cooking. It can also become an elaborate meal such as a thali when served with several other side dishes such as a vegetable curry, yogurt, sabzi shaak, onions, mango pickle and papad.\n\nSpices have traditionally been made on grinding stones, however, since villages have seen rapid growth and industrialization in recent decades, today people may use a blender or grinder. People from north Gujarat use dry red chili powder, whereas people from south Gujarat prefer using green chili and coriander in their cooking. There is no standard recipe for Gujarati dishes, however the use of tomatoes and lemons is a consistent theme throughout Gujarat.\nTraditionally Gujaratis eat mukhwas at the end of a meal to enhance digestion, and desserts such as \"aam shrikhand\" made using mango salad and hung curd are very popular. In many parts of Gujarat, drinking chaas (chilled buttermilk) or soda after lunch or dinner is also quite common.\n\nSurti delicasies include ghari which is a puri filled with khoa and nuts that is typically eaten during the festival Chandani Padva. Khambhat delicacies include famous sutarfeni – made from fine strands of sweet dough (rice or maida) garnished with pistachios, and \"halwasan\" which are hard squares made from broken wheat, khoa, nutmeg and pistachios. A version of English custard is made in Gujarat that uses cornstarch instead of the traditional eggs. It is cooked with cardamom and saffron, and served with fruit and sliced almonds. Gujarati families celebrate Sharad Purnima by having dinner with doodh-pauva under moonlight.\n\nThe history of Gujarati literature may be traced to 1000 AD. Since then literature has flourished till date. Well known laureates of Gujarati literature are Jhaverchand Meghani, Avinash Vyas, Hemchandracharya, Narsinh Mehta, Gulabdas Broker, Akho, Premanand Bhatt, Shamal Bhatt, Dayaram, Dalpatram, Narmad, Govardhanram Tripathi, Mahatma Gandhi, K. M. Munshi, Umashankar Joshi, Suresh Joshi, Pannalal Patel, Imamuddin khanji Babi Saheb (Ruswa mazlumi), Niranjan Bhagat, Rajendra Keshavlal Shah, Raghuveer Chaudhari and Sitanshu Yashaschandra Mehta.\n\nKavi Kant, Kalapi and Abbas Abdulali Vasi are Gujarati language poets. Ardeshar Khabardar, Gujarati-speaking Parsi who was president of Gujarati Sahitya Parishad was a nationalist poet. His poem, \"Jya Jya Vase Ek Gujarati, Tya Tya Sadakal Gujarat\" (Wherever a Gujarati resides, there forever is Gujarat) depicts Gujarati ethnic pride and is widely popular in Gujarat.\n\nGujarat Vidhya Sabha, Gujarat Sahitya Sabha, and Gujarati Sahitya Parishad are Ahmedabad based literary institutions promoting the spread of Gujarati literature.\nSaraswatichandra is a novel by Govardhanram Tripathi. Writers like Harindra Dave, Suresh Dalal, Jyotindra Dave, Dinkar Joshi, Prahlad Brahmbhatt, Tarak Mehta, Harkisan Mehta, Chandrakant Bakshi, Vinod Bhatt, Kanti Bhatt, Makarand Dave, and Varsha Adalja have influenced Gujarati thinkers.\n\nSwaminarayan paramhanso, like Bramhanand, Premanand, contributed to Gujarati language literature with prose like Vachanamrut and poetry in the form of bhajans. Kanji Swami a spiritual mystic who was honored with the title, 'Koh-i-noor of Kathiawar' made literary contributions to Jain philosophy and promoted Ratnatraya.\n\nGujarati theatre owes a lot to bhavai. Bhavai is a musical performance of stage plays. Ketan Mehta and Sanjay Leela Bhansali explored artistic use of bhavai in films such as \"Bhavni Bhavai\", \"Oh Darling! Yeh Hai India\" and \"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\". Dayro (gathering) involves singing and conversation reflecting on human nature.\n\nGujarati language is enriched by the Adhyatmik literature written by the Jain scholar, Shrimad Rajchandra and Pandit Himmatlal Jethalal Shah. This literature is both in the form of poetry and prose.\n\nFolklores are important part of Gujarati culture. The folktales of Kankavati are religious in nature because they sprung from the ordinary day-to-day human cycle of life independent of, and sometimes deviating from the scriptures. They are part of the Hindu rituals and practices for marriage,baby shower , naming ceremony, the harvest and death, and are not merely religious acts but they reflect the lived life of people in rural and urban societies.The anthologies of Dadaji Ni Vato and Raang Chhe Barot are pragmatic with practical and the esoteric wisdom. Saurashtra Ni Rasdhar is a collection of love legends and depicts every shade of love and love is the main emotion which makes human world beautiful because it calls forth patience, responsibility, sense of commitment and dedication.Also the study of Meghani‘s works is quintessential because he was a trailblazer in exploring the vast unexplored heritage of Gujarati folklore. His folktales mirrors milieu of Gujarat, dialects, duhas, decors, humane values, sense of sacrifice and spirit of adventure, enthusiasm and, of course, the flaws in people. Meghani‘s folktales are verbal miniature of Gujarati culture.\n\nNotable Gujarati businesspeople include\nDhirubhai Ambani,\nMukesh Ambani,\nAnil Ambani,\nthe Tata family, \nGautam Adani, \nKarsanbhai Patel,\nVirji Vora,\nShantidas Jhaveri,\nCurrimbhoy Ebrahim,\nHasmukhbhai Parekh,\nNautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta, \nNanji Kalidas Mehta,\nMuljibhai Madhvani,\nMayur Madhvani,\nMeghji Pethraj Shah,\nPremchand Roychand,\nKantilal Hirani,\nWalchand Hirachand,\nAmbalal Sarabhai,\nSadruddin Hashwani,\nJagmal Raja Chauhan,\nJairam Valjee Chouhan,\nFardunjee Marzban,\nAshish Thakkar,\nSudhir Ruparelia,\nAzim Premji,\nUday Kotak,\nDilip Shanghvi,\nRamanbhai Patel,\nAdamjee Peerbhoy,\nJ.

These include Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, and father of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Gujaratis have also been prime ministers of India. They include Morarji Desai, and the current prime minister Narendra Modi. Others involved in Gujarat or Indian National politics include current former chief minister Anandiben Patel, Rajesh Chudasama, Shaktisinh Gohil, Vitthal Radadiya, Vasanbhai Ahir, Purshottam Solanki, Prabhatsinh Pratapsinh Chauhan, Poonamben Madam, Asifa Khan, Vijay Rupani, Dileep Sanghani, Jayantilal Bhanusali, Arjun Modhwadia, Kandhal Jadeja and Shankar Chaudhary.\nThere have been many Gujaratis involved in Pakistani politics, with the most prominent individuals being stateswoman and leading founder of Pakistan, Fatima Jinnah; the sixth Prime Minister of Pakistan, I.I. Chundrigar; and the current Deputy Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan, Saleem Mandviwalla. Other important Pakistani-Gujarati politicians include Mahmoud Haroon, Hussain Haroon, Muhammad Dilawar Khanji, Zubeida Rahimtoola, Ashraf W. Tabani, Arshad Vohra, Habib Rahimtoola, and Abdul Qadir Patel, as well as many others.. UK politicians of Gujarati descent include Baron Desai, Baron Popat, Baron Verjee, Baron Dholakia, Baron Parekh, Shailesh Vara, and Priti Patel, among others as well as Canadian politician Arif Virani.\n\nVikram Sarabhai, Shrimad Rajchandra, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Gopaldas Ambaidas Desai, Ashoka Mehta, Indulal Yagnik, Sanat Mehta, Ravi Shankar Vyas, Jhaverchand Meghani, Abbas Tyabji, Mahadev Desai, Jayanti Dalal, K.M. Munshi, Jugatram Dave, Odhavram, Shyamji Krishna Varma, and S. R. Rana.\n\nFamous Bollywood veterans of Gujarati heritage include Sohrab Modi, Asha Parekh, Sanjeev Kumar, Jackie Shroff, Parveen Babi,Aditya Pancholi, Dimple Kapadia, Tina Ambani, Farooq Sheikh, Manmohan Panchamiya and Mehtab. Mehboob Khan was a pioneer of Hindi cinema, best known for directing the social epic drama \"Mother India\" (1957). As well as film directors such as Mehul Kumar, Mahesh Bhatt and Shreedatt Vyas Indian theatre personalities include Boman Irani, and Alyque Padamsee. Award-winning producer Ismail Merchant, won six Academy Awards in collaboration with Merchant Ivory Productions, whereas veteran playback singer Jaykar Bhojak has been performing in the industry for over two decades now. Bollywood actresses Prachi Desai and Ameesha Patel have found fame in recent times.\n\nManmohan Desai is remembered for casting actors like Raj Kapoor, Babita and Amitabh Bachchan in hit films he directed such as Chhalia, Kismat, and Amar Akbar Anthony, and Babubhai Mistry pioneered the use of special effects in films. Theatre veteran Chhel Vayeda was well known in Hindi cinema for being a popular production designer who designed the sets of over 50 films during his lifetime. Meanwhile, film tycoon Dalsukh Pancholi owned and operated one of the biggest cinema houses in Lahore and launched the careers of Punjabi film stars such as Noor Jehan in undivided India.Wadia Movietone was a noted Indian film production company and studio based in Mumbai, established in 1933 by Wadia brothers J. B. H. Wadia and Homi Wadia, whom were originally Parsis from Surat.\n\nDirector Chaturbhuj Doshi is today known as was one of the founding fathers of Gujarati cinema. Gujarati films have made artists like Naresh Kanodia, Upendra Trivedi, Snehlata, Raajeev, Roma Maneck, Aruna Irani and Asrani popular in the entertainment industry. Among these dynamic actors, the late Upendra Trivedi who was a leading veteran of Gujarati cinema, made a popular pair with the heroine Snehlata and together they co-acted in more than 70 Gujarati films. Arvind Trivedi by whom the famous character of Ravana was played in Ramanad Sagar's popular TV serial \"Ramayana\" is his brother.

{"id": "57050144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57050144", "title": "Isaak Lalayants", "text": "Isaak Lalayants\n\nIsaak Khristoforovich Lalayants (pseudonyms: \"Columbus, Izarov, Insarov\" et al.; , Kizlyar, Russian Empire – 14 July 1933, Moscow, Soviet Union) was a Russian revolutionary, Marxist, Bolshevik and comrade-in-arms of Vladimir Lenin.\n\nHe was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) since 1898 and member of its Central Committee from 1905 to 1906.\n\nIsaak Lalayants is born in the town of Kizlyar, in Terek Oblast. After learning initial Armenian literacy, he is sent to Tbilisi, where he enters the first class of the Realschule. During the transition to second grade, he is transferred to the Kazan real school, which he graduates in 1889.\n\nIn Kazan, Lalayants gets acquainted with prominent Russian Marxist Nikolai Fedoseev, who makes a very strong impression on him. Lalayants subsequently writes that Fedoseev possessed a strong and deep mind, that he was \"a man with brilliant talents both in the field of theory and practice\". In the years 1888–1889, Lalayants joins the Marxist circle of Fedoseev, under whose leadership he begins to study Marxist literature.\n\nHe studies at the Kazan Imperial University, but is expelled in 1889 after being arrested for participating in the revolutionary movement. He is deported from Kazan with an interdiction for an indefinite period to return there.\n\nFor around two years he stays in different cities of Russia, serving military service in the Caucasus. In Nizhny Novgorod he conducts social democratic propaganda in the workers' circles of Sormovo, the workshops of the Kurbatov shipping company and others.\n\nIn the autumn of 1892, Lalayants returns to Kazan, continuing revolutionary propaganda in social democratic circles among students and young workers. Together with local Marxists, he studies the works of Marx, Engels, Plekhanov and Kautsky. He also leads heated discussions with the Narodniks.\n\nLalayants translates Engels's \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" (1884) and Kautsky's \"The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx\" (1887).\nHe manages to establish contact with the publishing house J. W. H. Dietz (owned by SPD politician Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz) in Stuttgart and to receive Marxist literature from there. \"I personally\" writes Lalayants, \"was able to receive by mail directly from Dietz from Stuttgart, also in German, \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" by Fr. Engels. Thanks to some cunning Dietz (according to my warning about our customs censorship) Engels's book was skillfully woven into some 'double-entry bookkeeping' of some Schmidt, as a result of which it slipped across our border as a completely innocent thing. The gendarmerie seized it from me at the time of my arrest, half translated by me\".\n\nIn January 1893, Lalayants is arrested again and deported to Samara, where he spends the first days at the apartment of former Narodnaya Volya member Nikolay Dolgov, getting acquainted with Lenin and, through him, with Alexei Sklyarenko and other local Marxists. Lalayants recalls his first meeting with Lenin as follows: \"The next day (after coming to Samara) I went to Dolgov's. [...] Then someone knocked on the door – a young man around 22-23 years old entered. In front of me stood a man with unusual appearance, somehow immediately disposing himself. It was V. I. Ulyanov. He really impressed me then. In this twenty-three-year-old man, simplicity, sensitivity, cheerfulness and shyness, on the one hand, and solidity and depth of knowledge, ruthless logical sequence, lucidity and clarity of judgments and definitions, on the other, were combined in an amazing way. Samara immediately ceased to seem to me such a wilderness, and after that first meeting I was glad that I chose it myself\".\n\nIn Samara, Lalayants enters the illegal social democratic circle led by Lenin. Together with Lenin and Sklyarenko, he conducts extensive propaganda work (mainly among students and workers in railway workshops), also against the representatives of Narodism.\n\nIn June 1894, Lalayants receives a sentence in the Kazan case: 10 months of solitary confinement and 3 years of public surveillance. He is arrested and sent to Kresty Prison in Saint Petersburg. Learning about the fact that Lalayants is in the \"Saint Petersburg Prison for Solitary Confinement\" (official name under Imperial Russia), Lenin, through the student Olga Ivanovna Chachina, establishes contact with him, sending him literature (\"The Development of the Monist View of History\" (1895) by Georgi Plekhanov, among others). \"Thanks to the care of Vladimir Ilyich, I was a bit aware of at least the newly published legal literature\" recalls Lalayants.\n\nUpon liberation on 24 April 1895, Lalayants meets with Lenin and goes to Moscow, where he visits Lenin's relatives. \"All... evening and part of the next day,\" writes Lalayants, \"we were always together. From the stories of V. I., I learned a lot of interesting things about the life and work of the Petersburg circles; in particular, about the clandestine literary work of Vladimir Ilyich. From his words, I could conclude that in St. Petersburg, at that time, propaganda and even agitation work was quite firmly and widely established, especially among the workers of large factories; he also talked a lot about \"Materials for the Characterization of Our Economic Development\" (collection of articles), prepared for release, and about the disputes with Struve, about his relations with him. For me, the active and leading role of Vladimir Ilyich in all these works began to appear with sufficient clarity, although he himself did not stress it at all\". Lalayants leaves for Penza.\n\nIn September 1895, Lenin writes a letter to Lalayants about his . Lalayants hastens to Moscow to meet with Lenin. Returning to Penza after his meeting, he brings with him Lenin's illegal Marxist literature of foreign publication and a copy of \"Materials for the Characterization of Our Economic Development\", which includes Lenin's work \"The Economic Content of Narodism and the Criticism of it in Mr. Struve's Book\", published under the pseudonym K. Tulin. Lenin commissions Lalayants to continue his revolutionary work in the proletarian center of Ekaterinoslav.\n\nTowards the end of September 1895, Isaak Lalayants moves to Ekaterinoslav with his wife and revolutionary Praskovia Ivanovna Kulyabko. On their way to Moscow, Lalayants meets with Lenin and receives a letter of recommendation from him. \"On the same day,\" writes Lalayants, \"he managed to get a letter for me to one of the responsible workers in the Ekaterinoslav Railroad Administration – this is already a part of presenting me with some earnings, which was very significant for me as someone under surveillance, moreover in a completely unfamiliar city\".\n\nIn Ekaterinoslav –in the large workers' center of the south of Russia– Lalayants conducts large revolutionary work among factory and railway workers. He takes an active role in the creation of the local League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class and in the preparations for the first congress of the RSDLP.\n\nIn the early spring of 1897, Lalayants, together with Ivan Babushkin –a faithful pupil of Lenin exiled to Ekaterinoslav–, restore local Marxist circles (Lalayants leads the Ekaterinoslav \"Central Social Democratic Group\", and Babushkin, the workers' group) and in December 1897 unite them in one social democratic organisation called the Ekaterinoslav League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. For three or four years, Babushkin, Lalayants, Grigory Petrovsky, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Kazymyr Adamovich Petrusevych, P. A. Morozov, and other experienced revolutionaries, under strict clandestinity, save the local social democratic organisation from failure.\n\nComrades of Lalayants in the underground struggle characterized him as a man with great organisational talent, who managed for several years to lead the Ekaterinoslav social democrats. Through Lalayants, Babushkin and others, the Ekaterinoslav League, closely associated with the St. Petersburg League, receives literature from them and distributes it.\n\nFollowing the example of St. Petersburg League, the Ekaterinoslav League takes the path of transition to mass agitation; launches extensive organisational, agitation and propaganda activities among the workers, and seeks to expand its activities to neighboring cities, contributing to the emergence of social democratic circles in the Donbass.\n\nIn the publications and leaflets of the Ekaterinoslav League, widely distributed among the proletarians, the League talks about the urgent needs of the workers, the need for an organised struggle against tsarism and capitalism. Along with the St. Petersburg League, the Ekaterinoslav League is one of the first to start laying the revolutionary traditions of the mass social democratic labour movement.\n\nIn March 1898, Ekaterinoslav League representative Kazymyr Petrusevych attends the first congress of the RSDLP, which forms the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Returning to Ekaterinoslav after the congress, Petrusevych presents the resolutions of the congress to Lalayants and is arrested that same night. At a meeting of local social democrats, Lalayants reports on the first congress of the RSDLP. It is decided to reorganise the Ekaterinoslav League into the \"Ekaterinoslav Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party\".\n\nIn January 1899, the Ekaterinoslav social democrats, addressing the Ekaterinoslav workers with a special proclamation on the occasion of the First Congress, wrote: \"So, comrades, we will strive hard for the best part and we will wholeheartedly rejoice at the emergence of the workers' party as a messenger of a better future\".\n\nAfter almost three years of staying and working in Ekaterinoslav, Lalayants goes to Tbilisi and Voronezh. At the end of the summer of 1899, he returns to Ekaterinoslav and resumes his work at the local party committee. Together with Ivan Babushkin and Mikhail Tskhakaya, he conducts a struggle against the so-called \"Economists\" in order to unite local social democrats on Marxist positions. At that time, the Ekaterinoslav Committee had about 25 propaganda circles, which united up to 200 advanced workers. The Committee, led by Babushkin, Lalayants, Tskhakaya, and Grigory Petrovsky, educated them in the spirit of a political struggle for the fundamental interests of the working class, and directed the strike movement.\n\nIn January 1900, on the initiative of Babushkin and Lalayants, the illegal social democrat newspaper \"Yuzhny Rabochy\" (\"The Southern Worker\") begins to be published, which plays an important role in the development of the revolutionary workers' movement in southern Russia. The first editors of \"Yuzhny Rabochy\" are Lalayants, A. A. Mashitsky and S. K. Kharchenko. \"...In January 1900, the long-awaited newspaper \"Yuzhny Rabochy\" finally came out\" recalls Ivan Babushkin. \"At the workers' committee meeting it was partially read. [...] At the Bryansk factory, workers found one copy and were very surprised by the content: \"Look, it's like a real newspaper! There, and even chronicles and correspondence!\" And then they went to a secluded place to read the newspaper. This first newspaper remained in their memory for a long time and raised the mood, as they saw that, in spite of the arrests, the activity not only did not decrease, but, on the contrary, everything became more skillful and strong\".\n\nIn March 1900, Lalayants meets with Lenin in Moscow and agrees on a number of issues, including the organisation of the second congress of the RSDLP abroad. \"Approximately in the middle of March,\" Lalayants recalls, \"I think, having previously agreed, I went to Moscow, directly to the Ulyanovs'. Vladimir Ilyich and I found ourselves at home; these days he lived in Moscow, with his family, and, it seems, by special permission, since after exile he was forbidden to stay in Moscow and St. Petersburg. There is no need to say how happy it was for us to meet again after almost five years of being apart. During this time, so much accumulated about what to tell, not to mention the main reason for which I came. The two days with him and his family flew completely unnoticed for me. Vladimir Ilyich was extremely attentive to my information about the state of affairs in the south in general and especially in Ekaterinoslav\".\n\nLalayants responds warmly to Lenin's plan for the creation of the newspaper \"Iskra\" and the gathering of the party around this newspaper. In April 1900, shortly after returning from a detour about the convocation of the second party congress, Lalayants is arrested and, among others, sent to Kiev's Lukyanivska Prison, and then to the Moscow's Taganka and Butyrka prisons, where he stays until the spring of 1902. In March 1902, Lalayants is sent to exile to Eastern Siberia, but he does not reach his destination. He stops at Balagansk, Irkutsk Governorate, where, thanks to the care of Lenin, he receives a passport, money, and, through Samara, Saratov and Vilna in early July 1902, flees abroad to Berlin and then Zürich.\n\n\"I stayed in Samara for about a day,\" recalls Lalayants. \"Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova met me there, who gave me additional instructions, instructions, etc. on the journey ahead to the border and abroad; she also arranged for me to spend the night somewhere, I remember, at a dacha near Samara, with her good friends. However there, it seems, I did not meet with anyone, for purely conspiratorial reasons. In Saratov, where I went by boat from Samara to meet there with my wife and continue the journey together with her, I did not stay long. I managed, however, to dress in a \"liberal\" suit just in case, and almost the same day I went from there together with Praskovia Ivanovna directly to Vilna\".\n\nDuring all these years, Lenin has been tirelessly following Lalayants's life and revolutionary activities, and is in correspondence with him. In 18 May 1897, in a letter from the village of Shushenskoye to Moscow, to his mother Maria Alexandrovna and sister Maria Ilyinichna, Lenin asks: \"What news is there of Columbus? I have heard that he is married and is ill. Do you know anything about him?\" In October of the same year, in a letter to his mother, Lenin says: \"The doctor (from the north) asks me to give you his regards. (I correspond with him and Columbus fairly regularly)\".\n\nOn request of the party and personally Lenin, Lalayants moves to Geneva, where he continues his revolutionary work. He knows that in the near future the editorial board of \"Iskra\" and Lenin would move from London to Geneva. \"In those years,\" writes Lalayants, \"in Geneva there lived a mass of Russians of all ages and all views, ranging from radical democratic to the socialist revolutionary, anarchist and social democratic elements. Of course, the young people were predominantly socialist, predominantly revolutionary. The abundance of Russians (more precisely, the Russians) gave even a special imprint to the entire city, and the 'Russians' (the Swiss-Genevans poured out all natives of Russia, regardless of their nationality, into one bunch: the 'Russians'), once in Geneva, they began to feel 'at home'. It was not for nothing that some jokers suggested renaming Geneva to \"the city of Geneva, the Swiss province\"... On the other hand, it was already at that time that Geneva became the largest and most vibrant center of Russian foreign political life in comparison with other European cities.\n\nWhile in Geneva, Lalayants gets acquainted with the latest Marxist literature, reads \"Iskra\" and \"Zarya\", studies Lenin's book \"What Is To Be Done?\" (1902), often meets and talks with Georgi Plekhanov, and is in correspondence with Lenin. \"Lenin's book \"What Is To Be Done?\",\" writes Lalayants, \"twenty-two already published numbers of \"Iskra\", two books of the magazine \"Zarya\" and some other things, and, finally, the mentioned project of the party program of \"Iskra\" and \"Zarya\", on one hand. On the other hand, quite frequent conversations with Plekhanov on various topics and the correspondence with Lenin gave me the opportunity, before being separated from living life for more than two years, in a relatively short time, to become familiar with the state of affairs, to get acquainted in detail with the direction of \"Iskra\" and their views on the program, tactics and organization\".\n\nAt Lenin's suggestion, Lalayants and Praskovia Kulyabko are admitted to the League of Russian Revolutionary Social Democracy Abroad, joining the Leninist group of assistance to the \"Iskra\" organisation. In Geneva, Lalayants is in charge of the printing house of \"Iskra\", he leads circles among the Russian student colony and the \"Iskra\" support groups. \"In the winter and spring of 1902–03,\" writes Lalayants, \"I had several circles of self-education and propaganda, consisting mainly of Russian students, a very revolutionary and very sympathetic social democracy of the \"Iskra\" trend...\".\n\nLenin is very interested in the activities of Lalayants and gives him instructions. In a letter to Plekhanov, dated 19 December 1902, Lenin expresses his concern over a member of the printing house: \"Levinson is threatening to leave because Lalayants was made manager of the printery and he has quarreled with him. I wrote Lalayants asking him to “smooth” things out. Perhaps you too could help to calm down Levinson and impress it on Lalayants to handle him “with care”. I am sending to the printers (to Lalayants) the beginning of the translation of Kautsky and a popular pamphlet on army life. Please look through it at least in proofs\".\n\nIn a letter dated January 28, 1903, Lenin asks through Plekhanov that Lalayants or someone else translates and sends to London relevant materials from the Armenian Marxist newspaper of Leninist-Iskraist trend \"Proletariat\", organ of the League of Armenian Social Democrats. \"I am sending you \"Proletariat\" as well.\" writes Lenin, \"Please ask Lalayants or somebody else \"to translate in full everything\" in it about nationalism and \"federalism\" and send it to me \"as soon as possible\". An item on this should be published without fail (the piece sent in needs editing and for this we must have the text)\".\n\nAfter the second congress of the RSDLP, Lenin, through a confident and himself, returning to Geneva, informs Lalayants about the work of the congress and gives him a number of instructions; to go to Russia and to acquaint the Central Committee and the Southern Committees in detail about the whole course of events in connection with the split between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks at the congress. \"There is no need to say with what intense, unflagging attention I followed all the way to the very end of the story of Vladimir Ilyich\" recalls Lalayants.\n\nIn this difficult period for the party, Lalayants, along with Rosalia Zemlyachka, Nikolay Bauman, Elena Stasova, Maxim Litvinov, Sergey Ivanovich Gusev, Lydia Mikhailovna Knipovich, and other professional Bolshevik revolutionaries, endure on their shoulders the main burden of the struggle against the Mensheviks in Russia.\n\nLalayants returns to Russia immediately after the congress. Via Lyon, Paris and Berlin, he goes to Kiev, where he meets with Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, member of the Central Committee, and the Ulyanov family. \"The mission then was assigned to me by Lenin and Lengnik,\" writes Lalayants, \"to immediately go to Russia, to acquaint the Central Committee as fully as possible on the entire course of events that took place before the opening of the League Congress, during the Congress itself and in the early days of its closure, and in every possible way insist on the speedy departure from Geneva of Krzhizhanovsky and yet another member of the Central Committee. My departure from Geneva took place four or five days after the end of the Congress of the League and the turn of Plekhanov, on November 4 or 5, 1903\".\n\n\"The late Knunyants (Ruben-Rusov),\" continues Lalayants, \"one of the Caucasian delegates at the second congress of the party, supplied me with his \"own\" passport in the name of some Persian subject named Jean Jacob Leon... At the address given to me, I went to meet Krzhizhanovsky. I told him in a few words about the purpose of my visit. We agreed to meet that same evening at the meeting together with the other available members of the Central Committee, at which I would give detailed information. After parting till evening, I went with the proper precautions to search for the Ulyanov family, who also lived in Kiev at the time, and with whom I had not seen each other for about four years (since my talks with Vladimir Ilyich in Moscow in March 1900 about the then proposed convocation of the second congress). I found only Maria Alexandrovna and Anna Ilyinichna at home. After a lively conversation, parting, Anna Ilyinichna and I meet again before my departure from Kiev to go to the meeting place, at her suggestion, at Vladimir Cathedral. In the evening, as was agreed with Krzhizhanovsky, I arrived at the designated place; there were five or six people at that time completely unknown to me. I spoke in the most detailed manner about the recent events abroad, answered a number of questions asked to me in connection with my information, constantly telling me again and again the importance and the need for the speedy departure to Geneva of two members of the Central Committee, including necessarily Krzhizhanovsky.\"\n\nOn the advice of Lenin, in February 1904, the agents of the Central Committee of the party Vatslav Vorovsky, Lalayants, Kulyabko and K. O. Levitsky, create the Southern Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSDLP in Odessa, which unites the work of the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Nikolayev committees and establishes links with the Northern Bureau.\n\nThe Southern Bureau launches an active campaign for the convocation of the third RSDLP congress. Lalayants is at the center of this all-party work. He takes an active part in the compilation, printing and distribution of the detailed resolution of the Odessa Committee of the RSDLP, which sharply condemns \"both the nature of the struggle of the Mensheviks and the methods used by them in this struggle\". It is pointed out that the only way out of this 'intolerable situation' is \"the fastest convocation of the Third Congress, which alone can put an end to this completely abnormal state\". The Odessa Committee urges the rest of the party's committees to adhere to its demand for the convocation of the Third Congress.\n\nIn June 1904, Lalayants is again arrested and in January 1905 exiled to the Vologda Governorate, but again flees and arrives at the end of spring in St. Petersburg.\n\nLalayants is an active participant in the Russian Revolution of 1905. After the Third Party Congress, he is co-opted into the Bolshevik Central Committee, and on the instructions of Lenin, he unites a whole series of Party committees and instructs them. In 1906, as a member of the Central Committee, Lalayants leads a great deal of work in military organisations. After a short stay abroad (at the beginning of 1906), he works in St. Petersburg for the Narva outpost; as a member of the Petersburg Committee, he edits its organ-newspaper \"Kazarma\". Lalayants is one of the main organisers and chairman of the first conference of the military organisations of the party in Tammerfors, where he makes a report on the role of the party in the armed uprising. Lenin closely follows the progress of the conference, giving a positive assessment of his work.\n\nIn December 1906, Lalayants is arrested and after two years of pre-trial detention, he is convicted to 6 years of hard labour, serving in the St. Petersburg remand prison and in the Shlisselburg Fortress. At the end of 1913, he is exiled to an eternal settlement in Eastern Siberia: the Biryulskaya Volost of Verkholensky District, Irkutsk Governorate.\n\nIn the fall of 1914, Lalayants settles in Irkutsk, where he lives until 1921. Hard labour has made him severely ill, and has since withdrawn from the party and politics.\n\nOn a letter to Joseph Stalin, dated 20 October 1921, Lenin wrote:\n\nAt the end of 1921, Lenin summons Lalayants to Moscow, showing concern for him and paying him much attention.\n\nFrom 1922, Lalayants works in the Main Political Administration of the People's Commissariat for Education. In the last years of his life he writes his memoirs of Lenin and the party, from the very beginning of the birth of Bolshevism, to the struggle of Lenin's leadership for the creation and consolidation of party organisations.\n\nHe retired in 1929.\n\nIsaak Khristoforovich Lalayants died on 14 July 1933 after a long illness. In a pamphlet published in \"Pravda\", with the signature of Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova, Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov, V. Vishnyak and other old Bolsheviks, it was written: \"For a number of years since the beginning of the 1890s, Lalayants was one of Lenin's comrades-in-arms and friend. ...Both at work, and in prison, exile and hard labour, Lalayants enjoyed universal respect and love. Strict to others, he was especially strict towards himself. It can be said that before the revolution he was one of Lenin's best students and associates. Prison and penal servitude undermined the health of Lalayants and he had to quit his job soon. Lalayants's name is connected with the pre-revolutionary struggle of the Bolsheviks against the Narodniks and against the Mensheviks for the Leninist line. His great erudition, his solid theoretical godliness, his ardent revolutionary temperament put him in the forefront of revolutionary Social-Democracy\".\n\nIsaak Lalayants is buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1331824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1331824", "title": "James Freeman Clarke", "text": "James Freeman Clarke\n\nJames Freeman Clarke (April 4, 1810 – June 8, 1888) was an American theologian and author.\n\nBorn in Hanover, New Hampshire, James Freeman Clarke attended the Boston Latin School, graduated from Harvard College in 1829, and Harvard Divinity School in 1833. Ordained into the Unitarian church he first became an active minister at Louisville, Kentucky, then a slave state, and soon threw himself into the national movement for the abolition of slavery. His mild theology was unusual for the conservative town and, reportedly, several women walked out of his first sermon. As he wrote to his friend Margaret Fuller, \"I am a broken-winged hawk, seeking to fly at the sun, but fluttering in the dust.\"\n\nIn 1839 he returned to Boston where he and his friends established (1841) the Church of the Disciples which brought together a body of people to apply the Christian religion to social problems of the day. One of the features that distinguished his church was Clarke's belief that ordination could make no distinction between him and them. They also were called to be ministers of the highest religious life. Of this church he was the minister from 1841 until 1850 and again from 1854 until his death. He was also secretary of the Unitarian Association and, in 1867-1871, professor of natural religion and Christian doctrine at Harvard.\n\nClarke contributed essays to \"The Christian Examiner\", \"The Christian Inquirer\", \"The Christian Register\", \"The Dial\", \"Harper's\", \"The Index\", and \"Atlantic Monthly\". In addition to sermons, speeches, hymnals, and liturgies, he published 28 books and over 120 pamphlets during his lifetime. Clarke edited the \"Western Messenger\", a magazine intended to carry to readers in the Mississippi Valley simple statements of liberal religion and what were then the most radical appeals to national duty and the abolition of slavery. Copies of this magazine are now valued by collectors for containing the earliest printed poems of Ralph Waldo Emerson, a personal friend and a distant cousin. Clarke became a member of the Transcendental Club alongside Emerson and several others. Many of Clarke's earlier published writings were addressed to the immediate need of establishing a larger theory of religion than that espoused by people who were still under the influence of Calvinism.\n\nFor the \"Western Messenger\", Clarke requested written contributions from Margaret Fuller. Clarke published Fuller's first literary review—criticisms of recent biographies on George Crabbe and Hannah More. She later became the first full-time book reviewer in journalism working for Horace Greeley's \"New York Tribune\". After Fuller's death in 1850, Clarke worked with William Henry Channing and Emerson as editors of \"The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli\", published in February 1852. The trio censored or reworded many of Fuller's letters; they believed the public interest in Fuller would be temporary and that she would not survive as a historical figure. Nevertheless, for a time, the book was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century.\n\nIn 1855, Clarke purchased the former site of Brook Farm, intending to start a new Utopian community there. This never came to pass, instead the land was offered to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War; the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training and named it \"Camp Andrew\". In November 1861, Clarke was in Washington, D.C. with Samuel Gridley Howe and Julia Ward Howe. After hearing the song \"John Brown's Body\", he suggested that Mrs. Howe write new lyrics; the result was \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\".\n\nClarke was an advocate of human rights. Being a Boston Latin School alumnus, he served on a committee of the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women which was greatly instrumental in establishing Girls' Latin School in 1878. Tempered and moderate in his views of life, he was a reformer and a conciliator and never carried a pistol as fellow preacher Theodore Parker did.\nHe published few verses, but is regarded by some as a poet at heart. A diligent scholar, among the books by which he became well known is one called \"Ten Great Religions\" (2 vols, 1871–1883).\n\nJames Freeman Clarke was one of the very first Americans to explore and write about Eastern religions.\n\nA portrait of Clarke painted by E.T. Billings hangs in the Boston Public Library.\n\n\n"}

Together, they have written over 150 books, translated into more than thirty languages, including Tarot packs, a card-based storytelling system, screenplays, songs and other works.\n\nBeginning to work together in London in the 1970s, they wrote and published \"The Western Way\" in 1985. This followed the lead of Christine Hartley's \"The Western Mysteries Tradition\" (1968) by identifying and promoting a European mystical tradition to offset the then-current domination of Eastern mysticisms from India and China. The book included meditations to enable readers to make contact with their inner worlds. Historian Ronald Hutton considers this an influential work. They also edited \"The Encyclopedia of Celtic Wisdom\" (2000), devised the Storyworld series (2009ff) and, most recently, created \"The Steampunk Tarot: Gods of the Machine\" (2012).\n\nThey studied with two of the leading esotericists of the time, Gareth Knight and Dolorous Ashcroft-Nowicki, and from 1988 to 1992 they served as joint-presiders of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. Since 1989 they have run the Fellowship of Isis Lyceum, Domus Sophiae Terrae et Sancte Gradalis in Oxford, and are both members of the Archpriesthood Union as custodians of the legacy of the Fellowship of Isis.\n\nThey are active on the New Age workshop circuit, teaching their versions of the Celtic mysteries, Neo-shamanism, the Goddess and King Arthur. They were jointly listed 86th in the Watkins list of the 100 most spiritually influential living people worldwide for 2011. They live in Oxford, UK.\n\nJohn Matthews (born 1948) has been involved in study of the mysteries of Britain including the Arthurian Legends and the Grail Myth, for almost fifty years. He has published over ninety books on myth, the Arthurian Legends and Grail studies, including \"The Grail: Quest for the Eternal\" (1981), and most recently \"The Camelot Oracle\" (2012, with Will Worthington). He has also published short stories, a volume of poetry, and several children's books, most notably \"Pirates\" (2006) which was on the New York Times best-seller list for twenty-two weeks. His book \"Arthur of Albion\" (2009) won multiple awards, including a Gold Medal from NAPPA, a gold Moonbeams award and a BIB Golden Apple Award.\n\nHe has taught throughout Europe and the United States and has acted as advisor for a number of media projects including the Jerry Bruckheimer film \"King Arthur\" (2004). He has appeared on the History Channel and Discovery Channel programmes on Arthur and the Holy Grail, and shared a BAFTA award for his work on the educational DVD made to accompany \"King Arthur\". He has served as a guest editor for the international journal \"Arthuriana\", on whose editorial board he also sits. In 2009 he set up the production company Mythwood Films with Wil Kinghan, and a full-length feature, \"The Mermaids\", is forthcoming.\n\nCaitlín Matthews (born 1952) was born in Portsmouth, England, of British and Irish parents, and from an early age was aware of a spiritual dimension to life. She was briefly acquainted with the influential modern Druid Ross Nichols, and trained with Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki of the Servants of the Light (1978–1982). She was initiated into the Fellowship of Isis in 1977 and was subsequently ordained as priestess in 1988. She continues as arch-priestess in the Archpriesthood Union, as one of the custodians of the Fellowship of Isis.\n\nFollowing the publication of \"The Western Way\" she has written over sixty books including several works on the divine feminine, and the worlds of early Welsh and Irish literature. Her work reflects both the older academic sources and the newer Celtic mystical ones, but leaves out, according to Hutton, \"the scholarly publications of the 1980s, many of which have radically altered existing views of the sources for our knowledge of the ancient Celts.\"\n\nMatthews has led workshops in Britain and elsewhere, including the Temenos Academy, London; Regents College, Oxford; the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, the University of Lisbon in Portugal, and at Studium Generale of the Arnhem Institute for the Arts in Netherlands.\n\nRonald Hutton, commenting on Caitlín Matthews' works, states that she \"falls below the standards required of a professional historian. She makes no attempt to distinguish between the relative value of sources, so those from the seventh century and from the seventeenth are put together with no sense of context.\" He also states that she conditions her work to the needs of her audience and that she has incorrectly suggested parallels between Celtic lore and Native American religion.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Later the married couple went on to direct the romantic comedy-drama \"Ruby Sparks\" (2012), and the biographical sports drama \"Battle of the Sexes\" (2017). They are currently slated to direct a new Netflix comedy series, \"Living With Yourself\", starring Paul Rudd.\n\nDayton was born in Alameda County, California and grew up in Grass Valley, California. After graduating from Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, California, attended the UCLA Film School, studying film and television in the late-1970s; while there, he met Valerie Faris, a dance student and native of Los Angeles County, California, who became his wife and his partner. They have three children together. Valerie is the daughter of Paula Forbes, a supervising painter, and Jim Faris, a film editor.\n\nAs a pair, Dayton and Faris have directed and produced music videos, documentaries, commercials and films. They have directed music videos for bands such as Oasis, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys, and R.E.M.. Their 1996 video for \"Tonight Tonight\" by The Smashing Pumpkins won six MTV Video Music Awards. Another video of theirs that received significant success was for the 1990 Extreme song \"More Than Words\".\n\nThey directed a number of sketches for the 1995-1998 HBO sketch comedy series \"Mr. Show\".\n\nIn 1998, they established a production company, \"Bob Industries\".

In 2007 Perrotta wrote a screenplay with input from Dayton and Faris. However, by 2012 they had left the project, and it was taken over by director Lisa Cholodenko.\n\nTheir next film was \"Ruby Sparks\" in 2012. Dayton and Faris then directed \"Battle of the Sexes\", about the famous tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, with Emma Stone as King and Steve Carell as Riggs.

{"id": "30483032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30483032", "title": "Jordan Peterson", "text": "Jordan Peterson\n\nJordan Bernt Peterson (born June 12, 1962) is a Canadian professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a practicing clinical psychologist, and public intellectual. His main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology, with a particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief, and the assessment and improvement of personality and performance.\n\nPeterson studied at the University of Alberta and McGill University. He remained at McGill as a post-doctoral fellow from 1991 to 1993 before moving to Harvard University, where he was an assistant and then associate professor in the psychology department. In 1998, he moved back to Canada, as a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto, where he is currently a full professor.\n\nPeterson's first book, \"\", published in 1999, examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide. His second book, \"\", was released in January 2018.\n\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian government's Bill C-16. The act added gender identity as a prohibited ground of discrimination, which Peterson characterised as an introduction of compelled speech into law. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism. Peterson has been widely associated with the movement known as the Intellectual Dark Web. \n\nPeterson was born on June 12, 1962, and grew up in Fairview, Alberta, a small town northwest of his birthplace Edmonton, in Canada. He was the eldest of three children born to Beverley, a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter Peterson, a schoolteacher. His middle name is Bernt ( ), after his Norwegian great-grandfather.\n\nWhen he was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley – mother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th Premier of Alberta.<ref name=\"freedom/hate\"></ref> He also worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in \"The Road to Wigan Pier\", of \"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\" who \"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich\". He left the NDP at age 18.\n\nAfter graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature. He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982. Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe. There he began studying psychological origins of the Cold War, 20th-century European totalitarianism, and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984. In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.\n\nFrom July 1993 to June 1998, Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant and an associate professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals. Two former Ph.D. students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students. In July 1998, he returned to Canada and took up a post as a full professor at the University of Toronto.\n\nPeterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational, religious, ideological, political, and creativity psychology. Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017. \n\nFor most of his career, Peterson had an active clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He had been active on social media, but in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16 that changed his career and life. In 2017, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold, as well as, in 2018, temporarily stopping teaching because of new projects.\n\nIn 1999 Routledge published \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\". The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.\n\nAccording to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide. He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\". Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.\n\nIn 2004, a 13-part TV series based on Peterson's book \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\" aired on TVOntario.\n\nIn January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, \"\". The work contains abstract ethical principles about life, in a more accessible style than \"Maps of Meaning\".\nTo promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour. As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed by Cathy Newman on \"Channel 4 News\" which generated considerable attention, as well as popularity for the book. The book topped bestselling lists in Canada, US and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures (\"Personality and Its Transformations\", \"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\") and uploading them to YouTube. His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.3 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018. In January 2017, he hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. He used funds received on the crowdfunding website Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016. His funding through Patreon has increased from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017, more than $50,000 by July 2017, and over $80,000 by May 2018.\n\nPeterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows. Peterson supported engineer James Damore in his action against Google.\n\nIn May 2017, Peterson began \"The psychological significance of the Biblical stories\" a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability.\n\nIn 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises. Titled the Self Authoring Suite, it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto. Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students. According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.\n\nPeterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism.\n\nWriting in the \"National Post\", Chris Selley said Peterson's opponents had \"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions\", while in \"The Spectator\", Tim Lott stated Peterson became \"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia\". Peterson's social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of \"The Globe and Mail\" noted: \"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won\".\n\nAccording to his study – conducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy – of the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \"PC-egalitarianism\" and \"PC-authoritarianism\", which is a manifestation of \"offense sensitivity\". He places classical liberals in the first type, and places so-called social justice warriors, who he says \"weaponize compassion\", in the second. The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians.\n\nPeterson considers that the universities should be held as among the most responsible for the wave of political correctness which appeared in North America and Europe. According to Peterson, he watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s, and considers that the humanities have become corrupt, less reliant on science, and instead of \"intelligent conversation, we are having an ideological conversation\". From his own experience as a university professor, he states that the students who are coming to his classes are uneducated and unaware about the mass exterminations and crimes by Stalinism and Maoism, which were not given the same attention as fascism and Nazism. He also says that \"instead of being ennobled or inculcated into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from [the students] by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of relativism and power\".\n\nPeterson says that postmodern philosophers and sociologists since the 1960s have built upon and extended certain core tenets of Marxism and communism while simultaneously appearing to disavow both ideologies. He says that it is difficult to understand contemporary Western society without considering the influence of a strain of postmodernism thought that migrated from France to the United States through the English department at Yale University. He states that certain academics in the humanities ... started to play a sleight of hand, and instead of pitting the proletariat, the working class, against the bourgeois, they started to pit the oppressed against the oppressor. That opened up the avenue to identifying any number of groups as oppressed and oppressor and to continue the same narrative under a different name ... The people who hold this doctrine – this radical, postmodern, communitarian doctrine that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity or some kind of group identity paramount – they've got control over most low-to-mid level bureaucratic structures, and many governments as well. Peterson's perspective on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments has been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories.\n\nPeterson says that “disciplines like women's studies should be defunded” and advises freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies and racial studies, as well as other fields of study he believes are corrupted by the Neo-Marxist ideology. He says that these fields, under the pretense of academic inquiry, propagate unscientific methods, fraudulent peer-review processes for academic journals, publications that garner zero citations, cult-like behaviour, safe-spaces, and radical left-wing political activism for students. Peterson has proposed launching a website which uses artificial intelligence to identify and showcase the amount of ideologization in specific courses. He announced in November 2017 that he had temporarily postponed the project as \"it might add excessively to current polarization\".\n\nPeterson has criticized the use of the term \"white privilege\", stating that \"being called out on their white privilege, identified with a particular racial group and then made to suffer the consequences of the existence of that racial group and its hypothetical crimes, and that sort of thing has to come to a stop. ... [It's] racist in its extreme\". In regard to identity politics, while the \"left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride\" he considers them \"equally dangerous\" and that instead should be emphasized individualism and individual responsibility. He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating it promotes self-censorship in society and journalism.\n\nOn September 27, 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law\". In the video, he stated he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \"gender identity or expression\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the Criminal Code.\n\nHe stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free speech implications if the Criminal Code is amended, as he claimed he could then be prosecuted under provincial human rights laws if he refuses to call a transsexual student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun. Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \"directly or indirectly\" as offensive, \"whether intentionally or unintentionally\". Other academics and lawyers challenged Peterson's interpretation of C-16. \n\nThe series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty and labour unions, and critics accused Peterson of \"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\" and of \"fundamentally mischaracterising\" the law. Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention. When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \"it would depend on how they asked me [...] If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no [...] If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level\". Two months later, the \"National Post\" published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill and explained why he publicly made a stand against it:\n\nIn response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him that he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto.\n\nIn February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it. Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage. In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16. A media relations adviser for SSHRC said assess only the information contained in the application\". In response, The Rebel Media launched an Indiegogo campaign on Peterson's behalf. The campaign raised C$195,000 by its end on May 6, equivalent to over two years of research funding. In May 2017, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs hearing. He was one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill.\n\nIn November 2017, a teaching assistant at Wilfrid Laurier University first year communications course was censured by her professors for showing a segment of \"The Agenda\", which featured Peterson debating Bill C-16 with another professor, during a classroom discussion about pronouns. The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \"toxic climate\", being compared to a \"speech by Hitler\", and being itself in violation of Bill C-16. The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized. The events were criticized by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards and national newspaper columnists as an example of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors. Wilfried Laurier asked that the lawsuit be dismissed, saying that it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech.\n\nPeterson has argued that there is an ongoing \"crisis of masculinity\" and \"backlash against masculinity\" where the \"masculine spirit is under assault\". He has argued that feminism and policies such as no-fault divorce have had adverse effects on gender relations and destabilized society. He has argued that the existing societal hierarchy that the \"left\" has characterised as an \"oppressive patriarchy\" might \"be predicated on competence.\" Peterson has said that men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that \"enforced monogamy\", i.e. societies wherein monogamy is a social norm, decrease male violence. He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a push to \"feminize\" men, saying \"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\" He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview where he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap. Peterson disputed that the gender pay gap was solely due to sexual discrimination. Writing for \"The New York Times\", Nellie Bowles said that most of Peterson's ideas \"stem from a gnawing anxiety around gender\".\n\nPeterson doubts the scientific consensus on climate change. Peterson has said he is \"very skeptical of the models that are used to predict climate change\". He has also said, \"You can't trust the data because too much ideology is involved\". In a 2018 Cambridge Union address, Peterson said that climate change will not unite anyone, that focusing on climate change is \"low-resolution thinking\", and there are other more important issues in the world.\n\nPeterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989. They have one daughter and one son.\n\nPolitically, Peterson has described himself as a classic British liberal, and has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing. He is a philosophical pragmatist. On the matter of his religious beliefs, and whether or not he is Christian, Peterson has emphasized that his conceptualization of Christianity is probably not what it is generally understood, stating that the ethical responsibility of a Christian is to imitate Christ, for him meaning \"something like you need to take responsibility for the evil in the world as if you were responsible for it ... to understand that you determine the direction of the world, whether it's toward heaven or hell\". When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist\". Writing for \"The Spectator\", Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion, and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of Søren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos, and posits that life would be meaningless without this duality.\n\nStarting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings, displayed in his house as a reminder of, he argues, the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror. In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie (\"Great Seeker\"). Since late 2016, Peterson has been on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables, to control severe depression and an auto-immune disorder, including psoriasis and uveitis. He stopped eating any vegetables in mid-2018.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2592474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2592474", "title": "Luca Gaurico", "text": "Luca Gaurico\n\nLuca Gaurico (in Latin, Lucas Gauricus) (Giffoni March 12, 1475 – March 6, 1558 in Rome) was an Italian astrologer, astronomer, astrological data collector and mathematician. He was born to a poor family in the Kingdom of Naples, and studied judicial astrology, a subject he defended in his \"Oratio de Inventoribus et Astrologiae Laudibus\" (1508). Judicial astrology concerned the fate of man (\"astrologia judiciaria\"; mundane astrology) as influenced by the stars. His most famous work is the \"Tractatus Astrologicus\".\n\nGaurico's reputation was such that he served as an \"astrological consultant\" to Catherine de' Medici. Gaurico had predicted the accession to the papacy of Catherine's great-uncle Giovanni de Medici (when he was 14 – who later became Leo X) and predicted Catherine’s uncle Giulio de Medici involvement in important political struggles and numerous descendants. Giulio de Medici later was to become Pope Clement VII, who involved with disputes with both Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Henry VIII of England.\n\nGiovanni II Bentivoglio, ruler of Bologna, consulted him about his destiny. Displeased with Gaurico’s prophecy, Bentivoglio subjected Gaurico to the torture of mancuerda, the effects of which he suffered for the rest of his life, and exiled the astrologer. When Bologna fell to Pope Julius II, Gaurico returned to general favor.\n\nGaurico became famous after predicting the ascension of Alessandro Farnese, a prediction that came true with Farnese's ascension as Paul III. Gaurico foretold also the sickness and death of this Pontiff, who died on November 20, 1549, the day said to have been indicated by Gaurico. Paul III obviously did not wait for his death in order to verify Gaurico's prediction. Paul III, who encouraged astrologers to come to Rome and work under his protection, made Gaurico his unofficial astrologer, and he was made a Papal Table Companion, knighted, and appointed bishop of Giffoni (Salerno province), and thus described as \"Episcopus Geophonensis\", in 1539. Paul III made Gaurico bishop of Civitate (San Severo), in Capitanata, in southern Italy, in 1545. Four years after the death of Paul III, Gaurico abandoned these duties and settled in Rome.\n\nThe \"Tractatus Astrologicus\" contained the natal charts of popes and cardinals, kings and nobles, scholars, musicians and artists. Gaurico systematically examined each natal chart, compared it to the life of the person in question, and in the case of living subjects, predicted the outcome of their lives and careers. Gaurico also attempted to calculate the exact date of Jesus' crucifixion, and the number of hours between it and the resurrection. Allegedly, both he and Nostradamus were responsible for predicting the death of Henry II of France in a tournament in 1559.\n\nAllegedly, Catherine de' Medici had wished to know Henry's destiny as the Apparent Heir of France. Allegedly, Gaurico replied that the Heir would exert his royal power, which would first marked by a duel, and finally by another duel that would put a stop to his reign and his life. Allegedly, he also explained in detail the kind of wound that would result in the death of Henry II during this duel.\n\nAllegedly, the danger of this duel was considered impossible because of the social condition of the Prince, and Gaurico was not believed. Allegedly, Gaurico insisted on his statements, printed in France in 1552, that is, seven years before the well-known joust in which Henry II would find his death. He is also said to have sent a letter to the King repeating with full details his prediction and advising him to avoid any single combat in closed field, especially around the time when he had reached 41 years of age, since a wound on his head, at this age, could produce his blindness or his death. Allegedly, the letter did not deter Henry.\n\nOn July 1, 1559, during a match to celebrate the Peace Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis with his longtime enemies, the Habsburgs of Austria and to celebrate the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth of Valois to King Philip II of Spain, during the final joust, King Henry's eye was pierced by a sliver that penetrated the brain, from the shattered lance of Gabriel Montgomery, captain of the King's Scottish Guard. He suffered terribly, and, despite the efforts of royal surgeon Ambroise Paré, died on July 10, 1559 and was buried in a cadaver tomb in Saint Denis Basilica.\n\nIn fact, the one known horoscope of Henri II by Gaurico is literally quoted in the \"Dictionnaire\" of Pierre Bayle. There is no question of a duel. Gaurico promises the best successes to Henri II and adds that he shall live up to the age of 69 year, 10 month and 12 days, provided that he passes the years 56, 63 and 64 of his age.\n\nIn regard to the birth of Martin Luther, Gaurico found a connection between this date (November 10, 1483, according to the reckoning of the Gregorian Calendar) and a \"grand conjunction,\" that is, a meeting of the planets Jupiter and Saturn. Grand conjunctions were meant to predict extensive changes in the secular and religious power structures. Because the “grand conjunction” of 1484 took place in the sign of Scorpio, an astrological sign that stood for radical, revolutionary events as well as for epidemics and widespread death, this indicated to Gaurico that dramatic changes would occur in all social spheres –such as would result from the Reformation.\n\nGaurico has been identified by the historian Paola Zambelli as the author of an anonymous 1512 pamphlet that predicted a university deluge to take place in 1524 as a result of a conjunction of the superior planets in the watery sign of Pisces.\n\nGaurico was widely renowned as an astrologer, and his \"Tractatus Astrologicus\" (1552) also contained charts of the foundation of various buildings and cities. Pope Paul III thus used Gaurico to determine the most auspicious time at which the cornerstone of a new building in the neighborhood of St Peter's Basilica should be laid. It is said that Gaurico arrived at the scene in great pomp. An assistant, the astrologer Vincentius Campanatius of Bologna, was commanded to inspect the sky with an astrolabe and cry out in a loud voice the best time when the moment to lay the first marble slab arrived.\n\nGaurico ran a school of astrology at Ferrara. One of his pupils was Julius Caesar Scaliger. As a scholar, Gaurico edited George of Trebizon's translation of Ptolemy's \"Almagest\", a work Gaurico dedicated to Pope Nicholas V, who had commissioned the work. Gaurico theorized that Ptolemy was a native of Pelusium.\n\nThe lunar crater Gauricus is named after him.\n\n"}

She is a former president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women and was the New Democratic Party (NDP) Member of Parliament for Broadview—Greenwood from 1982 until 1988. McDonald is a professor emerita of sociology at the University of Guelph.\n\nMcDonald's first run for public office was during the 1981 provincial election when she was the Ontario New Democratic Party's candidate in the riding of Oriole in North York.\n\nThe next year, she entered federal politics and was elected in the by-election held to fill the vacancy created by Bob Rae's departure from federal politics to take the leadership of the Ontario NDP. She defeated senior party aide Gerald Caplan on the third ballot to win the NDP nomination. In the by-election she defeated former \"Toronto Sun\" editor Peter Worthington, who was running as an independent, by almost 2,000 votes. In the 1984 federal election, she increased her margin to over 3,500 votes again defeating Worthington who, this time, was running as the official Progressive Conservative candidate.\n\nIn Parliament, McDonald championed women's equality (she was the first Member of Parliament to be addressed as Ms.) and was also a notable opponent of smoking. She earned the enmity of the tobacco industry by moving a private member's bill to restrict smoking and ban tobacco advertising and sponsorships.\n\nBill C-204, the \"Non-smokers' Health Act\", was introduced by McDonald in October 1986 and proposed to restrict smoking in federally regulated workplaces as well as on planes, trains and boats. The Bill also would have banned tobacco advertising and sponsorships and regulated sales by listed tobacco products under the \"Hazardous Products Act\".\n\nMcDonald's bill was short-listed by a parliamentary committee for debate on the floor of the house and succeeded in winning growing support from MPs from all sides of the House of Commons as health groups lobbied in its favour. On April 22, 1987, ten days prior to the Bill's scheduled second reading vote, Health Minister Jake Epp announced the government's intention to introduce a bill that would ban tobacco advertising and sponsorships and strengthen health warnings on cigarette packages. The government also announced that it would prohibit smoking in government buildings and restrict it in other federally regulated workplaces.\n\nDespite intense lobbying by the tobacco industry, both McDonald's bill and Epp's Bill C-51, were passed by parliament and given royal assent on June 28, 1988. The lobbying around McDonald's bill is credited with giving Epp the political motivation to introduce his own legislation. McDonald's bill passed in a free vote despite the fact that every member of Cabinet present in the House voted against it.\n\nMcDonald was defeated in the 1988 federal election by Liberal Dennis Mills by 1,200 votes. She attempted a comeback against Mills in the 1993 federal election, but was defeated by almost 10,000 votes as support for the NDP collapsed nationwide.\n\nMcDonald has since been active on environmental issues, initially with the Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout, and lately as co-founder of JustEarth: A Coalition for Environmental Justice, which works on climate change; she is a member of the Board of Directors of Climate Action Network Canada. \nSince 2011 McDonald has been campaigning for an electoral alliance for the 2015 federal election, to lead to proportional representation; she is a co-founder of the Canadian Electoral Alliance.\n\nShe was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2015.\n\nMcDonald is the author of a number of books and scholarly articles including \n\"The Early Origins of the Social Sciences\" (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1993), \"Women Founders of the Social Sciences\" (Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1994), \"and Women Theorists on Society and Politics\" (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1998). She is the director of \"The Collected Works of Florence Nightingale\", a 16-volume edition of Florence Nightingale's books, articles, pamphlets and previously unpublished correspondence, gathered from more than 200 archives worldwide. Publication, by Wilfrid Laurier University Press, began with volume 1 in 2001, and ended with volume 16 in 2012.\n\nShe is co-founder of \"The Nightingale Society\" which promotes the legacy of Florence Nightingale.\n\n\n"}

He sometimes signals to observing teams to avoid pitfalls he dug either as defense or to trap animals. In 2018, FUNAI released a video of him in order to raise global awareness of the threats to the uncontacted peoples in Brazil.

According to his own statements he was a M.A., and was ordained by the Bishop of Galloway, 17 July 1662, at Westminster; and on 6 February 1682 was made chaplain in ordinary to Charles II. But Matthew Smith in 1700, when engaged with Kingston in a political controversy, charged him with having forged his letters of orders. Jonathan Trelawny in the 1680s, and Thomas Tenison in the 1690s, had become aware that Kingston was an impostor. He ceased to wear clerical dress. When Kingston published on the subject in 1700, he made an unconvincing case. He was son of a Northamptonshire farmer, who became a tailor's apprentice.\n\nIn 1665, Kingston was minister at St. James's, Clerkenwell, and worked during the Great Plague; Trelwany believed he was then a tailor, had found sermons, and preached in the absence of the incumbent. He had resigned this preferment before 17 September 1666, and took up a living at Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, appointed by Nicholas Knollys who called himself 3rd Earl of Banbury. In 1678, he received the living of Henbury in Gloucestershire, possibly by purchasing the right himself. He asserted that a prebend and a rectory were added to Henbury. He remained there, on a small estate, till the Glorious Revolution, when he sold his property and moved to London.\n\nFor a period Kingston spied in London for the Jacobites. In 1692, he was discovered by the government agent John Macky, and was turned to spy for the other side. By the second half of the 1690s, he was working for Sir William Trumbull, and in the end his cover was blown when he testified in treason trials. He had a pension to write for the government, but it fell into arrears and he descended into poverty. A petition from him dated 1699 states that £600 was due to him.\n\nIn 1700, Kingston attacked Smith, who had just published his \"Memoirs of Secret Service\", and a controversy ensued: Kingston attributed Smith's works to Tom Brown. Kingston also intervened in the controversy which raged in 1707–9 about the so-called French Prophets. In 1707, his attack on Dr. John Freind's vindication of the Earl of Peterborough's conduct in Spain appeared; he was arrested by order of the House of Lords. He was, however, released, 19 January 1708, and the attorney-general was instructed to prosecute him.\n\nKingston wrote:\n\n\nKingston also mentions that he wrote a work called \"Cursory Remarks\".\n\nKingston was twice married, as a bigamist, and in 1699 had nine children.

Born in Erith, southeast London, Napper was brought up in nearby Plumstead. His background was troubled and dysfunctional. The marriage of his parents was violent and Napper witnessed violent attacks on his mother. His parents divorced when he was 9 and he and his siblings (two brothers and a sister) were placed in foster care and underwent psychiatric treatment. The psychiatric counselling Napper had at the Maudsley Hospital in Camberwell lasted for six years.\n\nAt age 13, Napper underwent a personality change after a family friend sexually assaulted him on a camping holiday. The offender was jailed, but Napper became introverted, obsessively tidy and reclusive, according to his mother. He also bullied his siblings and spied on his sister while she was naked.\n\nIn 1986, Napper first came to police attention after being convicted of an offence with an airgun. In October 1989, police had rejected information conveyed in a phonecall from Napper's mother that her son had admitted to perpetrating a rape on Plumstead Common. No case apparently matched the evidence. However, it emerged at the time of Napper's second conviction, that a rape of a 30-year-old woman, in front of her children, eight weeks earlier, had been reported to have occurred in a house which backed on to Plumstead Common. At this point, Pauline Napper broke off all contact with her son.\n\nOn 15 July 1992 on Wimbledon Common, Napper stabbed the young mother Rachel Nickell forty-nine times in front of her son Alex, then aged two, who clung on to his mother's body begging her to wake up. Napper was questioned about unsolved attacks on other women during the year, but was eliminated from inquiries. \n\nIn November 1993, in the Bisset home in Plumstead, Napper stabbed 27-year-old Samantha Bisset in her neck and chest, killing her, and then sexually assaulted and smothered her four-year-old daughter, Jazmine Jemima Bisset. In her sitting room, Napper mutilated Samantha's body, taking away parts of her body as a trophy. The crime scene was reportedly so grisly that the police photographer assigned to the case was forced to take two years' leave after witnessing it. \n\nAfter a fingerprint belonging to Napper was recovered from Samantha's flat, he was arrested, and charged with the murders of Samantha and Jazmine Bisset, in May 1994. Napper was convicted at the Old Bailey in October 1995. He also admitted two rapes and two attempted rapes at this time. From the time of the first Old Bailey trial, he has been held at Broadmoor. In December 1995 he was questioned about Nickell's death but denied any involvement. \n\nNapper is also believed to be the \"Green Chain Rapist\", who carried out at least 70 savage attacks across south-east London over a four-year period ending in 1994. The earliest of the 'Green Chain' rapes have been linked to Napper, and were those he admitted to in 1995. Napper is known to have kept detailed records of the sites of potential and actual attacks on women. During the investigation into the rapes, Napper had been eliminated due to his 6' 2\" height, as detectives had decided to exclude anyone over 6' based on the description of a 5' 7\" rapist. However there are conflicting witness reports of the rapist's height and Napper walked with a stoop. \n\nThe investigation to find Nickell's murderer resulted in the attempted prosecution of an innocent man, Colin Stagg, until, in 2004, advances in DNA profiling revealed Napper's connection to the case. On 18 December 2008, Napper was convicted of the manslaughter of Rachel Nickell on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He also admitted to four other attacks on women. Napper was sentenced to be incarcerated indefinitely at Broadmoor Hospital for the criminally insane. In his summing up at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Griffiths Williams said to Napper: \"You are on any view a very dangerous man\".\n\n\n"}

Her father was John James Nolan Craddock who was Anglo-Indian and her mother was Mabel Mary Ann Adams who was British. She learned to dance in India. before she moved to Britain around 1909. Craddock took the name Roshanara which built on the celebrity of the princess Roshanara Begum.\nShe danced with Loie Fuller's company and then undertook training with the Spanish dancer Carmen Tórtola Valencia. In 1911 she danced in London in Oscar Asche's Kismet and then as Zobeide in Scheherazade. This role was with the Ballets Russes at Covent Garden. The following year she appeared with Anna Pavlova's dance company as a speciality dancer. She had several dances that were performed using extracts from the 1880s Oriental opera Lakmé by the French composer Léo Delibes.\n\nCraddock started to work in the United States in 1916 where she appeared in Vaudeville theatres. In 1917 she and Japanese dancer Michio Itō were the specialty dancers with Adolf Bolm's company \"Ballet Intime\". Roshanara also appeared with Ratan Devi who was a British singer who had been to India to study music. Devi was accompanied by her husband Ananda Coomaraswamy who was employed by the Boston Museum of Art as an expert on Indian culture. Coomaraswamy wrote about how Roshanara was an authentic nautch dancer in contrast to Ruth St Denis who a few years before had shown Indian style dances.\n\nCraddock arrived as an \"alien\" emigrant in New York in 1923. Craddock taught dancing and the later film star, Bette Davis was one of her pupils. She died in her thirties on 16 July 1926 in Asheville, North Carolina. from appendicitis.\n\nRoshanara copyrighted ten of her dances.\n\nCraddock has been compared to the American dancer Ruth St. Denis who popularised oriental style dances in America. Although Craddock had been trained in India she devoted her time to improving the perfection of her dance. Ruth St. Denis was inspired by Oriental style dance and she founded her own dance school where her students included Martha Graham. Craddock never established her own school and this is considered the reason that she never had the lasting impact that Ruth St. Denis made. Deborah Jowitt writes that Craddock's dances may not have been learnt in India in fact she believes there is a lot of similarity between Craddock's style and that of St Denis some years before. St Denis however seemed to respect Craddock and she followed her career.\n\nRoshenara was captured by Ashcan painter Robert Henri. The painting sold for $132,500 in 2000.\n\n"}

He was military Governor (1967–1975) of the Mid-West State, later renamed Bendel State, part of which in turn became Edo State. After the return to democracy in 1999, he became a power in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In September 2009, Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo state and others attended his 77th birthday celebration in Benin.\n\nOsaigbovo Ogbemudia was born in Benin City on September 17, 1932, he was named after his grandfather. In Edo language, the name Ogbemudia can be inferred to mean \"this family has come to stay\". As a youth he lived with his elder cousin, Mr. FS Uwaifo, a Benin-based businessman. \nHe attended Benin Baptist School (1941–1945), and then the government school, Victoria, in the Cameroons (1945–1947). His secondary education was at the Western Boy's High School, Benin City (1947–1949).\n\nHe joined the Nigeria army in 1956, training at Teshie, Ghana and at Netheravon and Salisbury Plain in England (1957). He attended the officer cadet school at Aldershot, England in 1960, and was commissioned second lieutenant in 1961. \nHe attended the United States army special welfare school at Fort Bragg, North Carolina in 1962. Ogbemudia served with the United Nations peacekeeping force in the Congo for 16 months, and served in Tanzania in 1964. He was appointed as an instructor to the Nigerian Military School, Zaria in 1964.\n\nIn January, 1966, a coup d'état overthrew the civilian government of Nigeria. In July 1966 the military ruler Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi was deposed and killed in the so-called Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966 led by Lieutenant Colonel Murtala Mohammed. Ironsi's chief of staff Yakubu Gowon became head of state. As the Brigade Major of the Ist Brigade in Kaduna, Ogbemudia played an important role in the counter-coup by disarming his troops in Kaduna at the suggestion of artillery commander Lt-Colonel Alex Madiebo. During the counter-coup/mutiny, an attempt on Major Ogbemudia's life was also made by then Lt Buka Suka Dimka but Major Ogbemudia escaped because of a tip from Colonel Hassan Katsina and Major Abba Kyari. \nIn August that year he was transferred to the area command, Benin City as Quarter Master-General, 4th Area Command. Ogbemudia along with Major General Ejoor, the Military Governor of the Mid-western State and Pius Ermobor, an intelligence officer were the only three officers of the rank of Major and above who held strategic leaderships positions and who were not from the Igbo speaking communities of the Mid-west region. On August 9, 1967, Biafran troops led by Victor Banjo invaded Mid-western region and its capital, Benin city with minimal resistance, a surprise attack which success was helped in part by an arrangement between Biafran leaders and some senior officers from the 4th Area Command. Ejoor was able to escape to Lagos while Ogbemudia briefly went underground organizing a resistance movement composed of people disaffected by the invasion. He later left for Army Headquarters, Lagos and joined the Murtala Mohammed led Second Infantry Division on a counterattacking mission to Midwest. On September 20, 1967, troops led by Ogbemudia seized Benin city from Biafran forces.\n\nOgbemudia was appointed Military administrator of Mid-West state in September, 1967 following the liberation of state from the secessionist Biafran forces.\nPromoted to Lt. Colonel, Ogbemudia was appointed Military Governor of the state on 26 October 1967. \nA populist, dedicated to reconstruction after the war, he initiated improvements in the areas of sports, urban development, education, public transportation, housing and commerce.\nHe built the Ogbe sports stadium, now named the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, and in August 1973 he commissioned the three-story National Museum in Benin City.\nOther projects included the Agbede Mechanized Farm, Rural Electrification Board, Bendel Steel Structures, Bendel Pharmaceuticals, Bendel Boatyard, the University of Benin and the Bendel Line.\nIn later years, people looked back on his governorship as a time when much was achieved, followed by stagnation in later administrations.\n\nMembers of his cabinet included Edwin Clark, Frank Oputa-Otutu, T.E.A. Salubi, and Lawrence Leo Borha.\n\nIn July 1975, when Murtala Mohammed became head of state, he retired the twelve military governors who had served under Yakubu Gowon. The retirement of governors found guilty of corruption was converted to dismissal. Among these was Brigadier General Samuel Ogbemudia, whom Murtala, then leader of the Mid-west invasion had unilaterally appointed eight years earlier, and whom he replaced by Colonel George Agbazika Innih. Ogbemudia was investigated by a panel in 1975 but felt he could not receive a fair trial because the head of the panel had been relieved of his previous position by Ogbemudia. The 1975 asset investigation panel however found him guilt of corrupt enrichment. In the second republic, he was cleared by the Bendel State House of Assembly of mis-governance.\n\nOgbemudia was in London during the July 1975 coup and helped with renovations of Gowon's London abode after the ex-president went into exile.\n\nDuring a brief return to civil rule, Samuel Ogbemudia was elected governor of Bendel State in Oct 1983 as candidate for the National Party of Nigeria, replacing Ambrose Alli of the Unity Party of Nigeria. However, he lost his position in December that year when Muhammadu Buhari became military ruler after a coup d'état that overthrew civilian President Shehu Shagari.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1989, Ogbemudia Chairman of the Nigerian Sports Commission, in 1989, Babangida appointed him as the Sole Administrator of the struggling Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC). During his administration, the operations and finances of the corporation improved before he left NRC in 1992.\n\nGeneral Sani Abacha, military head of state from November, 1993 until his death in June, 1998, appointed Ogbemudia as minister for Labor and Productivity.\nSamuel Ogbemudia was quoted as saying he would die for Abacha.\nOgbemudia supported a move to have Abacha stand for election, saying \"The nation has made wonderful progress under General Abacha ... He is, no doubt, the only answer to Nigeria's progress and development\".\n\nAfter the restoration of democracy in 1998/1999, Ogbemudia was one of the founders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo state, and a member of the party's Board of Trustees. \nOgbemudia and Chief Anthony Anenih between them controlled PDP politics in Edo State for the next decade, at first working well together but later coming into open conflict.\n\nIn December 2004, Ogbemudia was said to have agreed that Anthony Anenih should nominate his choice of governor for Edo State. He said he did not want a situation where one senatorial district in the state had a permanent hold on the position of governor.\nIn November 2007, at an enlarged meeting of the PDP at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, Ogbemudia spoke strongly against proposals by Anthony Anenih to change existing zoning arrangement of offices, then walked out of the meeting.\n\nIn December 2006, Ogbemudia expressed support for the presidential bid of Dr Mohammed Buba Marwa.\n\nOn 20 March 2008, a tribunal nullified the election of Oserheimen Osunbor (PDP) as Edo State governor due to voting irregularities, and declared comrade Adams Oshiomhole of the Action Congress as the winner.\nIn an interview in November that year, as a prominent member of the PDP board of trustees Ogbemudia said he would have preferred a PDP member to have won. However, he accepted the tribunal result, and described Oshiomhole as a man of strong character. He spoke critically of earlier governors, such as Chief Lucky Igbinedion.\n\nIn July 2009, Ogbemudia was leader of a PDP faction that was supporting Prof. Julius Ihonvbere as candidate for the Edo State governorship in 2011. A rival faction led by Tony Anenih favoured Senator Odion Ugbesia as candidate.\nIn October 2009, Ogbemudia failed to attend the unity rally of the party in Edo state organised by Anthony Anenih.\nA month later, Ogbemudia praised Oshiomhole's accomplishments in his first year of office, leading to speculations of a possible political alliance between the two men.\n"}

Tasco mainly makes telescopes for amateur astronomers but has expanded into other optical products such as spotting scopes, microscopes, binoculars, and telescopic sights and other rifle accessories. Tasco sells via specialty outlets, catalogues, and online retailers.\n\nTasco is based in Miramar, Florida. George Rosenfield founded the firm as the Tanross Supply Company in 1954. It started as a distributor of fishing tackle and hardware. The name was later shortened to Tasco as inventory expanded to include binoculars and eyepieces.\n\nTasco manufactures a variety of optical equipment including terrestrial telescopes, microscopes, binoculars, telescopic sights, and accessories.\n\nThree categories of telescopes are available from Tasco - \"Novice,\" \"Luminova\", and \"Spacestation.\" Each family has several models. The \"Novice\" family features the most economical telescopes using manual focus and view finding, while the high end \"Spacestation\" utilizes fully automated sky-mapping, \"GoTo\" technology. Magnification ranges of the telescopes are advertised as between 25 and 675 power. \n\nTasco's astronomical telescopes have a noted poor reputation as a usable instrument. It is one of several companies that follows the deceptive practice of advertising their products based on claims of high magnification, far beyond any attainable usable magnification. Tasco's astronomical products usually get lumped in with the whole series of telescopes pejoratively referred to as \"department store telescopes,\" low quality and low-cost instruments targeted at the impulse purchase market.\n\nTasco was founded and owned by George Rosenfield in 1954. In March 1996, Rosenfield sold the business. At that time, Tasco employed 160 people at its Florida headquarters, and maintained a location in the state of Washington, which employed 40.\nIn June 1998, Tasco purchased Celestron, another telescope manufacturer which focused on performance optical equipment and the more serious observer. Celestron was second only to Meade Instruments Corporation in sales of telescopes.\n\nEarly 2001, Tasco began searching for a buyer as profits sank. Meade Corporation begins negotiations for a merger, but the Federal Trade Commission blocked the attempt.\n\nBy June 2002, Wind Point Partners, the parent company of Bushnell Performance Optics (BPO) purchased the Tasco brand and all the company's intellectual property.\n\nIn July 2007, Wind Point Partners sold Bushnell Performance Optics along with Tasco property and sales rights to MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm based in New York and London.\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2013, Alliant Techsystems announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Bushnell. Under the terms of the transaction, ATK paid $985 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.\n\nATK spun-off Vista Outdoor upon closing its merger with Orbital Sciences and became Orbital ATK on February 9, 2015. Anyone holding ATK common stock at the end of the business day on February 2, 2015 received two shares of Vista Outdoor common stock. Eligible shareholders had their brokerage account credited or received a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership. Vista Outdoor was thus initially 100% owned by ATK shareholders. Vista Outdoor stock traded on a \"when-issued\" basis from January 29, 2015 to February 9, 2015. It began \"regular way\" trading on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2015 under the ticker symbol \"VSTO.\" No payment or action of any kind was required of shareholders. This transaction was conducted on a tax-free basis. U.S. shareholders generally did not have to recognize a gain or loss for federal tax purposes.\n\nOn May 29, 2002, Tasco Worldwide initiated liquidation of all its assets. after defaulting on nearly $30 million in loans.\nThe company had been searching for a buyer for several months, but after much interest by Meade Corporation, the Federal Trade Commission, on this day, sanctioned a temporary restraining order in federal district court to preempt any attempt by Meade Instruments Corporation, the leading manufacturer of performance telescopes in the United States, to purchase all, or certain assets, of Tasco Holdings, Inc. including Celestron, a child-company, and number two performance telescope provider in the U.S. The FTC argued that an acquisition by Meade of Celestron would negatively impact the performance telescope market by eliminating significant competition between the two companies and by creating a monopoly in the market for Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, which were currently only being sold in the U.S. by Celestron and Meade.\n\nLater in 2002, Tasco and Celestron, then under the ownership of Bushnell Performance Optics, fired back with lawsuits also in the District Court of California, alleging Meade products infringed on a United States patent entitled \"Tripod Structure for Telescopes.\" Both companies sought injunctive relief and compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, and attorneys' fees and costs. In December 2002, the District Court denied both Celestron's and Tasco’s motion.\n\n"}

In the 1950s, before conference venues had proper facilities for interpreters, Pilley developed portable equipment, consisting of microphones, headphones, wiring and associated electronics; this equipment could be moved from place to place, to provide temporary facilities for simultaneous interpreting during international conferences; Pilley named this equipment \"Archie\", after the famous ventriloquist’s dummy.\n\nPilley was a co-founder of the International Association of Conference Interpreters, and of the Institute of Linguists. He was also the owner and principal of The Linguists’ Club, a language and social club in London. At The Linguists’ Club, Pilley established \"working parties\", an educational tool used to teach aspiring interpreters. Participants were first screened to establish both their language proficiency as well as their aptitude to the work; successful applicants were then trained in the art of professional interpreting.\n\nIn his later years, Pilley was recognized as an \"Officier d’Académie\" by the French Government, for his services to France.\n"}

{"id": "12589061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12589061", "title": "Timeline of Mary Wollstonecraft", "text": "Timeline of Mary Wollstonecraft\n\nThe lifetime of British writer, philosopher, and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) encompassed most of the second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political reform movements in Britain gained strength, the American colonists successfully rebelled, and the French revolution erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to see the end of the democratic revolution when Napoleon crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the Seven Years' War, it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet Robert Southey later wrote: \"few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. Old things seemed passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race.\"\n\nPart of what made reform possible in Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century was the dramatic increase in publishing; books, periodicals, and pamphlets became much more widely available than they had been just a few decades earlier. This increase in available printed material helped facilitate the rise of the British middle class. Reacting against what they viewed as aristocratic decadence, the new professional middle classes (made prosperous through British manufacturing and trade), offered their own ethical code: reason, meritocracy, self-reliance, religious toleration, free inquiry, free enterprise, and hard work. They set these values against what they perceived as the superstition and unreason of the poor and the prejudices, censorship, and self-indulgence of the rich. They also helped establish what has come to be called the \"cult of domesticity\", which solidified gender roles for men and women. This new vision of society rested on the writings of Scottish Enlightenment philosophers such as Adam Smith, who had developed a theory of social progress founded on sympathy and sensibility. A partial critique of the rationalist Enlightenment, these theories promoted a combination of reason and feeling that enabled women to enter the public sphere because of their keen moral sense. Wollstonecraft's writings stand at the nexus of all of these changes. Her educational works, such as her children's book \"Original Stories from Real Life\" (1788), helped inculcate middle-class values, and her two \"Vindications\", \"A Vindication of the Rights of Men\" (1790) and \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792), argue for the value of an educated, rational populace, specifically one that includes women. In her two novels, \"\" and \"\", she explores the ramifications of sensibility for women.\n\nThe end of the eighteenth century was a time of great hope for progressive reformers such as Wollstonecraft. Like the revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine and others, Wollstonecraft was not content to remain on the sidelines. She sought out intellectual debate at the home of her publisher Joseph Johnson, who gathered leading thinkers and artists for weekly dinners, and she traveled extensively, first to be a part of the French revolution and later to seek a lost treasure ship for her lover in what was then exotic Scandinavia, turning her journey into a travel book, \"Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark\". After two complicated and heart-rending affairs with the artist Henry Fuseli and the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay (with whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Together, they had one daughter: Mary Shelley, the author of \"Frankenstein\". Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 due to complications from this birth, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. Today, she is most often remembered for her political treatise \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" and is considered a foundational feminist philosopher.\n\n"}

{"id": "6022504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6022504", "title": "Vladimir Volkoff", "text": "Vladimir Volkoff\n\nVladimir Volkoff (7 November 1932 in Paris – 14 September 2005 in Bourdeilles, Dordogne), was a French writer of Russian extraction. He produced both literary works for adults and spy novels for young readers under the pseudonym Lieutenant X. His works are characterised by themes of the Cold War, intelligence and manipulation, but also by metaphysical and spiritual elements.\n\nOf Russian descent with Tatar roots on his paternal side, Volkoff was the son of a Russian émigré who earned his living in France washing cars. Vladimir grew up with his family's memories of the lost motherland and loyalty to their new homeland. He was a great grandnephew of the composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.\n\nAfter studying at the Sorbonne in Paris and the university of Liège, Volkoff taught English at Amiens from 1955-57. He served as an intelligence officer in the French army during the Algerian War, where he learnt how war is fought as much in the shadows and the embassies as in the open air of the battlefield.\n\nAfter his demobilisation, Volkoff travelled to the United States to teach French and Russian literature. He worked as a translator (1963–65), and a professor of French and Russian from 1966-77. Fascinated by the powerful country teeming with contradictions, he remained there for almost three decades, returning to France in 1992. Among his \"American\" works are \"L'Agent triple\" (1962), \"Métro pour l'enfer\" (1963), \"Les Mousquetaires de la République\" (1964) and \"Vers une métrique française\" (1977).\n\nThroughout the 1970s under his pseudonym Lieutenant X, Volkoff published stories for teenagers in the \"Langelot\" series of Hachette's Bibliothèque verte imprint, featuring the adventures of the eponymous hero, a young French secret agent. In these works Volkoff showed his taste for romantic intrigues and plot twists, and his profound understanding of the balance of forces prevailing in the world.\n\nIn the later 1970s, with the standoff between East and West a constant reality, Volkoff's writings analyzed the ideological combat between two opposing conceptions of the world and of freedom with a solid geopolitical background.\n\nAn avid competitive fencer, Volkoff was a valued member of the Georgia Division of the AFLA and the Atlanta (and later, Macon) fencing community during his time in America. He claimed to have begun learning to fence in a stint in the Foreign Legion. His book \"The Traitor,\" translated from the French by J.F. Bernard and published by Doubleday and Company was written ??and?? published during his time in Atlanta (1973); it was published under another pseudonym, Lavr Divomlikoff (a reshuffling of the letters of his name).\n\nVolkoff's 1979 novel \"Le retournement\" (\"The Turnaround\") earned him international acclaim and was translated into a dozen languages. Dedicated to Graham Greene, whom Volkoff greatly admired, the novel's title refers to the intelligence manoeuvre of turning an uncovered enemy agent to one's own side. The book tells a story of espionage in which the American, French and Soviet intelligence services do battle, but also of a spiritual overturning which, unknown to these secret services, almost makes a martyr of the main character.\n\nIn 1980 Volkoff published \"Les humeurs de la mer\", a vast contemporary fresco in four volumes: \"Olduvaï\", \"La leçon d'anatomie\" (\"The Anatomy Lesson\"), \"Intersection\" and \"Les maîtres du temps\" (\"Masters of Time\"). With \"Le montage\" (\"The Set Up\"; winner of the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française, 1982) Volkoff illustrated the methods and networks of tricks and traps of Soviet \"disinformation\" in Europe; the idea of this novel could have come from Alexandre de Marenches, director of the SDECE, who may have provided the factual basis for its plot.\n\nIn 1985, inspired by his American experience, he published \"Le professeur d'histoire\" (\"The History Teacher\"), in which he portrayed a comic confrontation between a literary man filled with tradition and a young heiress surfing the wave of modernism.\n\nPower, manipulation, battles of influence and disinformation take a central role in many of his books, such as \"L'Interrogatoire\" (1988) and \"Les Hommes du Tsar\" (1989), a historical novel about Russia from the death of Ivan the Terrible to the advent of the Romanovs.\n\nIn the 1990s Volkoff published \"Le Bouclage\" (1990), a novel about the insecurity of large cities, and \"La Trinité du Mal ou réquisitoire pour servir au procès posthume de Lénine, Trotski et Staline\" (\"The Trinity of Evil, or an indictment for the posthumous trial of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin\") (1991).\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall opened Volkoff's work to all kinds of disinformation and manipulation campaigns, not just those of communist regimes. Volkoff established a place for the term \"désinformation\" in the French language with his books \"La Désinformation Arme de guerre\" (republished in 2004 by Les éditions L'Age d'Homme), \"La Crevasse\" (1996), \"Petite histoire de la désinformation\" (\"A short history of disinformation\") (1999), \"Désinformation flagrant délit\" (1999), \"L'Enlèvement\" (2000) and \"Manuel du politiquement correct\" (\"Handbook of the Politically Correct\") (2001).\n\nIn the 2000s he returned to his Slavic roots, publishing several texts on Russian history and orthodoxy, and publicly declared his support for Vladimir Putin's policies.\n\nIn addition, Volkoff wrote historical biographies such as \"Vladimir\", \"Le Soleil Rouge\" (\"The Red Sun\") and \"Tchaikovsky\", and also wrote for the theatre. He was awarded the Grand Prix Jean Giono for his work in 1995 and in the same year was made a \"Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur\".\n\nVladimir Volkoff is survived by his widow, Carla Denise Volkoff.\n"}
{"id": "79451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79451", "title": "William Pitt the Younger", "text": "William Pitt the Younger\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806) was a prominent British Tory statesman of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He became the youngest British prime minister in 1783 at the age of 24. He left office in 1801, but was Prime Minister again from 1804 until his death in 1806. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer for most of his time as Prime Minister. He is known as \"the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, called \"William Pitt the Elder\" or simply \"Chatham\", who had previously served as Prime Minister.\n\nThe younger Pitt's prime ministerial tenure, which came during the reign of George III, was dominated by major events in Europe, including the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Pitt, although often referred to as a Tory, or \"new Tory\", called himself an \"independent Whig\" and was generally opposed to the development of a strict partisan political system. He led Britain in the great wars against France and Napoleon. Pitt was an outstanding administrator who worked for efficiency and reform, bringing in a new generation of outstanding administrators. He increased taxes to pay for the great war against France and cracked down on radicalism. To engage the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the Acts of Union 1800 and tried (but failed) to get Catholic emancipation as part of the Union. He created the \"new Toryism\", which revived the Tory Party and enabled it to stay in power for the next quarter-century.\n\nThe historian Asa Briggs argues that his personality did not endear itself to the British mind, for Pitt was too solitary and too colourless, and too often exuded superiority. His greatness came in the war with France. Pitt reacted to become what Lord Minto called \"the Atlas of our reeling globe\". His integrity and industry and his role as defender of the threatened nation allowed him to inspire and access all the national reserves of strength. William Wilberforce said that, \"For personal purity, disinterestedness and love of this country, I have never known his equal.\" Historian Charles Petrie concludes that he was one of the greatest prime ministers \"if on no other ground than that he enabled the country to pass from the old order to the new without any violent upheaval ... He understood the new Britain.\" For this he is ranked highly amongst British Prime Ministers.\n\nThe Honourable William Pitt, second son of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, was born at Hayes Place in the village of Hayes, Kent.\nPitt was from a political family on both sides. His mother, Hester Grenville, was sister to former prime minister George Grenville. According to biographer John Ehrman, Pitt inherited brilliance and dynamism from his father's line, and a determined, methodical nature from the Grenvilles.\n\nSuffering from occasional poor health as a boy, he was educated at home by the Reverend Edward Wilson. An intelligent child, Pitt quickly became proficient in Latin and Greek. In 1773, aged fourteen, he attended Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied political philosophy, classics, mathematics, trigonometry, chemistry and history. At Cambridge, Pitt was tutored by George Pretyman, who became a close personal friend. Pitt later appointed Pretyman Bishop of Lincoln then Winchester and drew upon his advice throughout his political career. While at Cambridge, he befriended the young William Wilberforce, who became a lifelong friend and political ally in Parliament. Pitt tended to socialise only with fellow students and others already known to him, rarely venturing outside the university grounds. Yet he was described as charming and friendly. According to Wilberforce, Pitt had an exceptional wit along with an endearingly gentle sense of humour: \"no man ... ever indulged more freely or happily in that playful facetiousness which gratifies all without wounding any.\"\nIn 1776, Pitt, plagued by poor health, took advantage of a little-used privilege available only to the sons of noblemen, and chose to graduate without having to pass examinations.\nPitt's father, who had by then been raised to the peerage as Earl of Chatham, died in 1778. As a younger son, Pitt the Younger received a small inheritance. He received legal education at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in the summer of 1780.\n\nDuring the general elections of September 1780, Pitt, at the age of 21, contested the University of Cambridge seat, but lost. Still intent on entering Parliament, Pitt, with the help of his university comrade, Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland, secured the patronage of James Lowther. Lowther effectively controlled the pocket borough of Appleby; a by-election in that constituency sent Pitt to the House of Commons in January 1781. Pitt's entry into parliament is somewhat ironic as he later railed against the very same pocket and rotten boroughs that had given him his seat.\n\nIn Parliament, the youthful Pitt cast aside his tendency to be withdrawn in public, emerging as a noted debater right from his maiden speech. Pitt originally aligned himself with prominent Whigs such as Charles James Fox. With the Whigs, Pitt denounced the continuation of the American War of Independence, as his father strongly had. Instead he proposed that the prime minister, Lord North, make peace with the rebellious American colonies. Pitt also supported parliamentary reform measures, including a proposal that would have checked electoral corruption. He renewed his friendship with William Wilberforce, now MP for Hull, with whom he frequently met in the gallery of the House of Commons.\n\nAfter Lord North's ministry collapsed in 1782, the Whig Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham was appointed prime minister. Pitt was offered the minor post of vice-treasurer of Ireland, but he refused, considering the post overly subordinate. Lord Rockingham died only three months after coming to power; he was succeeded by another Whig, William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne. Many Whigs who had formed a part of the Rockingham ministry, including Fox, now refused to serve under Lord Shelburne, the new prime minister. Pitt, however, was comfortable with Shelburne, and thus joined his government; he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nFox, who became Pitt's lifelong political rival, then joined a coalition with Lord North, with whom he collaborated to bring about the defeat of the Shelburne administration. When Lord Shelburne resigned in 1783, King George III, who despised Fox, offered to appoint Pitt to the office of prime minister. But Pitt wisely declined, for he knew he would be incapable of securing the support of the House of Commons. The Fox–North coalition rose to power in a government nominally headed by William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.\n\nPitt, who had been stripped of his post as Chancellor of the Exchequer, joined the Opposition. He raised the issue of parliamentary reform in order to strain the uneasy Fox-North coalition, which included both supporters and detractors of reform. He did not advocate an expansion of the electoral franchise, but he did seek to address bribery and rotten boroughs. Though his proposal failed, many reformers in Parliament came to regard him as their leader, instead of Charles James Fox.\n\nLosing the war and the thirteen colonies was a shock to the British system. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's fiscal-military state when it had powerful enemies and no allies, depended on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication, and was faced for the first time since the 17th century by both Protestant and Catholic foes. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption. The result was a crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed due to the return of American business. That crisis ended in 1784 as a result of the King's shrewdness in outwitting Fox and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of Pitt. Historians conclude that the loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the French Revolution with more unity and organisation than would otherwise have been the case.\n\nThe Fox-North Coalition fell in December 1783, after Fox had introduced Edmund Burke's bill to reform the East India Company to gain the patronage he so greatly lacked while the King refused to support him. Fox stated the bill was necessary to save the company from bankruptcy. Pitt responded that: \"Necessity was the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It was the argument of tyrants; it was the creed of slaves.\" The King was opposed to the bill; when it passed in the House of Commons, he secured its defeat in the House of Lords by threatening to regard anyone who voted for it as his enemy. Following the bill's failure in the Upper House, George III dismissed the coalition government and finally entrusted the premiership to William Pitt, after having offered the position to him three times previously.\n\nA constitutional crisis arose when the King dismissed the Fox-North coalition government and named Pitt to replace it. Though faced with a hostile majority in Parliament, Pitt was able to solidify his position in a few months' time. Some historians argue that his success was inevitable given the decisive importance of monarchical power; others argue that the King gambled on Pitt and that both would have failed but for a run of good fortune.\n\nPitt, at the age of 24, became Great Britain's youngest Prime Minister ever. The contemporary satire \"The Rolliad\" ridiculed him for his youth:\n\nMany saw Pitt as a stop-gap appointment until some more senior statesman took on the role. However, although it was widely predicted that the new \"mince-pie administration\" would not last out the Christmas season, it survived for seventeen years.\n\nSo as to reduce the power of the Opposition, Pitt offered Charles James Fox and his allies posts in the Cabinet; Pitt's refusal to include Lord North, however, thwarted his efforts. The new Government was immediately on the defensive and in January 1784 was defeated on a motion of no confidence. Pitt, however, took the unprecedented step of refusing to resign, despite this defeat. He retained the support of the King, who would not entrust the reins of power to the Fox–North Coalition. He also received the support of the House of Lords, which passed supportive motions, and many messages of support from the country at large, in the form of petitions approving of his appointment which influenced some Members to switch their support to Pitt. At the same time, he was granted the Freedom of the City of London. When he returned from the ceremony to mark this, men of the City pulled Pitt's coach home themselves, as a sign of respect. When passing a Whig club, the coach came under attack from a group of men who tried to assault Pitt. When news of this spread, it was assumed Fox and his associates had tried to bring down Pitt by any means.\n\nPitt gained great popularity with the public at large as \"Honest Billy\" who was seen as a refreshing change from the dishonesty, corruption and lack of principles widely associated with both Fox and North. Despite a series of defeats in the House of Commons, Pitt defiantly remained in office, watching the Coalition's majority shrink as some Members of Parliament left the Opposition to abstain.\n\nIn March 1784, Parliament was dissolved, and a general election ensued. An electoral defeat for the Government was out of the question because Pitt enjoyed the support of King George III. Patronage and bribes paid by the Treasury were normally expected to be enough to secure the Government a comfortable majority in the House of Commons but on this occasion the government reaped much popular support as well. In most popular constituencies, the election was fought between candidates clearly representing either Pitt or Fox and North. Early returns showed a massive swing to Pitt with the result that many Opposition Members who still had not faced election either defected, stood down, or made deals with their opponents to avoid expensive defeats.\n\nA notable exception came in Fox's own constituency of Westminster which contained one of the largest electorates in the country. In a contest estimated to have cost a quarter of the total spending in the entire country, Fox bitterly fought against two Pittite candidates to secure one of the two seats for the constituency. Great legal wranglings ensued, including the examination of every single vote cast, which dragged on for more than a year. Meanwhile, Fox sat for the pocket borough of Tain Burghs. Many saw the dragging out of the result as being unduly vindictive on the part of Pitt and eventually the examinations were abandoned with Fox declared elected. Elsewhere Pitt won a personal triumph when he was elected a Member for the University of Cambridge, a constituency he had long coveted and which he would continue to represent for the remainder of his life.\n\nHis administration secure, Pitt could begin to enact his agenda. His first major piece of legislation as Prime Minister was the India Act 1784, which re-organised the British East India Company and kept a watch over corruption. The India Act created a new Board of Control to oversee the affairs of the East India Company. It differed from Fox's failed India Bill 1783 and specified that the Board would be appointed by the King. Pitt was appointed, along with Lord Sydney who was appointed President. The Act centralised British rule in India by reducing the power of the Governors of Bombay and Madras and by increasing that of the Governor-General, Charles Cornwallis. Further augmentations and clarifications of the Governor-General's authority were made in 1786, presumably by Lord Sydney, and presumably as a result of the Company's setting up of Penang with their own Superintendent (Governor), Captain Francis Light, in 1786.\n\nIn domestic politics, Pitt also concerned himself with the cause of parliamentary reform. In 1785, he introduced a bill to remove the representation of thirty-six rotten boroughs, and to extend in a small way, the electoral franchise to more individuals. Pitt's support for the bill, however, was not strong enough to prevent its defeat in the House of Commons. The bill introduced in 1785 was Pitt's last parliamentary reform proposal introduced in Parliament.\n\nAnother important domestic issue with which Pitt had to concern himself was the national debt, which had doubled to £243 million during the American war. Every year a third of the budget of £24 million went to pay interest. Pitt sought to reduce the national debt by imposing new taxes. In 1786, he instituted a sinking fund so that £1,000,000 a year was added to a fund so that it could accumulate interest; eventually, the money in the fund was to be used to pay off the national debt. By 1792 the debt had fallen to £170 million.\n\nPitt always paid careful attention to financial issues. A fifth of Britain's imports were smuggled in without paying taxes. He made it easier for honest merchants to import goods. By lowering tariffs on easily smuggled items such as tea, wine, spirits and tobacco, he grew the customs revenue by nearly £2 million.\n\nPitt sought European alliances to restrict French influence, forming the Triple Alliance with Prussia and Holland in 1788. During the Nootka Sound Controversy in 1790, Pitt took advantage of the alliance to force Spain to give up its claim to exclusive control over the western coast of North and South America. The Alliance, however, failed to produce any other important benefits for Great Britain.\n\nIn 1788, Pitt faced a major crisis when the King fell victim to a mysterious illness, a form of mental disorder that incapacitated him. If the sovereign was incapable of fulfilling his constitutional duties, Parliament would need to appoint a regent to rule in his place. All factions agreed the only viable candidate was the King's eldest son, Prince George, Prince of Wales. The Prince, however, was a supporter of Charles James Fox; had he come to power, he would almost surely have dismissed Pitt. However, he did not have such an opportunity, as Parliament spent months debating legal technicalities relating to the regency. Fortunately for Pitt, the King recovered in February 1789, just after a Regency Bill had been introduced and passed in the House of Commons.\n\nThe general elections of 1790 resulted in a majority for the government, and Pitt continued as Prime Minister. In 1791, he proceeded to address one of the problems facing the growing British Empire: the future of British Canada. By the Constitutional Act of 1791, the province of Quebec was divided into two separate provinces: the predominantly French Lower Canada and the predominantly English Upper Canada. In August 1792, coincident with the capture of Louis XVI by the French revolutionaries, George III appointed Pitt as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, a position whose incumbent was responsible for the coastal defences of the realm. The King had in 1791 offered him a Knighthood of the Garter, but he suggested the honour go to his elder brother, the second Earl of Chatham.\n\nAn early favourable response to the French Revolution encouraged many in Great Britain to reopen the issue of parliamentary reform, which had been dormant since Pitt's reform bill was defeated in 1785. The reformers, however, were quickly labelled as radicals and as associates of the French revolutionaries. Subsequently, in 1794, Pitt's administration tried three of them for treason but lost. Parliament began to enact repressive legislation in order to silence the reformers. Individuals who published seditious material were punished, and, in 1794, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended. Other repressive measures included the Seditious Meetings Act (which restricted the right of individuals to assemble publicly) and the Combination Acts (which restricted the formation of societies or organisations that favoured political reforms). Problems manning the Royal Navy also led to Pitt to introduce the Quota System in 1795 in addition to the existing system of Impressment.\nThe war with France was extremely expensive, straining Great Britain's finances. Unlike in the latter stages of the \"Napoleonic Wars\", at this point Britain had only a very small standing army, and thus contributed to the war effort mainly by sea power and by supplying funds to other coalition members facing France.\n\nThroughout the 1790s, the war against France was presented as an ideological struggle between French republicanism vs. British monarchism with government seeking to mobilise public opinion in support of the war. The Pitt government waged a vigorous propaganda campaign contrasting the ordered society of Britain dominated by the aristocracy and the gentry vs. the \"anarchy\" of the French revolution, and always sought to associate British \"radicals\" with the revolution in France. Though the Pitt government did drastically reduce civil liberties and created a nationwide spy network with ordinary people being encouraged to denounce any \"radicals\" that may have been in their mist, the historian Eric Evans argued the picture of Pitt's \"reign of terror\" as portrayed by the Marxist historian E.P Thompson is incorrect, stating there is much evidence of a \"popular conservative movement\" that rallied in defense of King and Country. Evans wrote there were about 200 prosecutions of \"radicals\" suspected of sympathy with the French revolution in British courts in the 1790s, which was much less than the prosecutions of suspected Jacobites after the rebellions of 1715 and 1745. However, the spy network maintained by the government was efficient. In Jane Austen's novel \"Northanger Abbey\"-which was written in the 1790s, but not published until 1817-one of the characters remarks it is not possible for a family to keep secrets in these modern times when spies for the government were lurking everywhere, which captures well the tense, paranoid atmosphere of the 1790s when people were being encouraged to report \"radicals\" to the authorities.\n\nIn 1793, Pitt decided to take advantage of a slave revolt in the French colony of St. Domingue (modern Haiti) to seize the richest French colony in the world, believing this was would strike a great blow at France while bringing St. Domingue into the British Empire and ensuring the slaves in the British West Indies would not be inspired to likewise revolt. Many of those who owned slave plantations in the British West Indies had been greatly alarmed by the Haitian revolution, which began in 1791, and were strongly pressing Pitt to restore slavery in St. Domingue, lest their own slaves be inspired to seek freedom. The British landed in St. Domingue on 20 September 1793, stating they had come to protect the white population from the blacks, and were able to seize some coastal enclaves. The fact that the British had came to restore slavery in St. Domingue inspired ferocious resistance from the Haitians, who had no desire to be forced into chains again. The heavy death toll caused by yellow fever, the much dreaded \"black vomit\", made conquering St. Domingue impossible, but an undeterred Pitt launched what he called the \"great push\" in 1795, sending out the largest British expedition yet mounted to conquer St. Domingue.\n\nIn November 1795, the \"great push\" began with 218 ships leaving Portsmouth for St. Domingue. After the failure of the Quiberon expedition earlier in 1795 when the British landed a force of French royalists on the coast of France who were annihilated by the forces of the republic, Pitt had decided it was crucial for Britain to have St. Domingue, no matter what the cost in lives and money, to improve Britain's negotiating hand when it came time to make peace with the French republic. The British historian Michael Duffy argued that since Pitt committed far more manpower and money to the Caribbean expeditions, especially the one to St. Domingue, than he ever did to Europe in the years 1793–98 that it is proper to view the West Indies as Britain's main theater of war and Europe as more of a sideshow. By 1795, 50% of the British Army was deployed in the West Indies with the largest contingent in St. Domingue with the rest of the British Army all divided between Britain, Europe, India and North America.\n\nAs the British death toll caused by yellow fever continued to climb, Pitt was criticised in the House of Commons with several MPs suggesting it might be better to abandon the expedition, but Pitt insisted that Britain had given its word of honor that it would protect the French planters from their former slaves, and the expedition to St. Domingue could not be abandoned. The British attempt to conquer St. Domingue in 1793–1798 ended in disaster with the British pulling out on 31 August 1798 after having spent 4 million pounds (a sum roughly equal to about £224,120,000.00 in today's money) and having lost about 100,000 dead or men crippled for life over the preceding five years, due mostly to yellow fever, achieving nothing. The British historian Sir John William Fortescue wrote that Pitt and his cabinet had tried to destroy French power \"in these pestilent islands ... only to discover, when it was too late, that they practically destroyed the British army\". Fortescue concluded that Pitt's attempt to add St. Domingue to the British empire had killed off most of the British army, cost the British treasury a fortune and weakened British influence in Europe, making British power \"fettered, numbered and paralyzed\", all for nothing.\n\nThroughout the 1790s, the popularity of the Society of United Irishmen led by Wolfe Tone, whom influenced by the American and French revolutions demanded independence and republicanism for Ireland, grew. The United Irishmen Society was very anti-clerical, being equally opposed to the \"superstitions\" promoted by both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church, which caused the latter to support the Crown. Realising that the Catholic church was an ally in the struggle against the French revolution, Pitt had tried fruitlessly to persuade the Dublin parliament to loosen the anti-Catholic laws to \"keep things quiet in Ireland\". Pitt's efforts to soften the anti-Catholic laws failed in the face of determined resistance from the families of the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland, who forced Pitt to recall Earl Fitzwilliam as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1795, when the latter had indicated he would support a bill for Catholic relief. In much of rural Ireland, law and order had broken down as an economic crisis impoverished the already poor Irish peasantry and a sectarian war with many atrocities on both sides had begun in 1793 between Catholic \"Defenders\" vs Protestant \"Peep o'Day Boys\". A section of the Peep o'Day Boys had renamed themselves the Loyal Orange Order in September 1795, who were fanatically committed to upholding Protestant supremacy in Ireland at \"almost any cost\". In December 1796, a French invasion of Ireland led by General Lazar Hoche that was supposed to land at the same time the United Irishmen would rise up only failed because of bad weather in the Bay of Biscay. Pitt sent General Lake to Ulster in 1797 to call out Protestant Irish militiamen and organised an intelligence network of spies and informers to crush the United Irishmen.\n\nIn April 1797, the Pitt government was badly shaken by the mutiny of the entire fleet at Spithead with the sailors demanding a pay increase to match inflation. The Spithead mutiny occurred at exactly the same moment that the French and their Dutch allies were preparing for an invasion of Great Britain which threw the government into a state of panic. To regain control of the fleet, Pitt agreed to sailors' demands for pay increases and to have George III pardon the mutineers. By contrast, the more political \"floating republic\" naval mutiny at the Nore in June 1797 led by Richard Parker who blockaded London for a time inspired a more repressive approach from Pitt who made it clear he would not negotiate with Parker, whom he wanted to see hanged as a mutineer. In response to the naval mutinies of 1797, Pitt passed an act that made it unlawful to advocate breaking oaths to the Crown and passed the Defense of the Realm act in 1798, which further restricted civil liberties.\n\nIn 1797, Pitt was forced to protect the kingdom's gold reserves by preventing individuals from exchanging banknotes for gold. Great Britain would continue to use paper money for over two decades. Pitt was also forced to introduce Great Britain's first ever income tax. The new tax helped offset losses in indirect tax revenue, which had been caused by a decline in trade. In May 1798, the long simmering unrest in Ireland exploded into outright rebellion with the United Irishmen Society launching a revolt to win independence for Ireland. Pitt took an extremely repressive approach to the United Irishmen with the Crown executing about 1, 500 United Irishmen after the revolt. The United Irishmen revolt of 1798 destroyed Pitt's faith in the competence of the Dublin parliament dominated by the Ascendancy families to govern Ireland, believing a less sectarian and more conciliatory approach would have avoided the uprising altogether, which led him to seek an Act of Union that would make Ireland an official part of the United Kingdom and end the \"Irish Question\". The fact that the French had sent expeditions to Ireland in 1796 and again in 1798 to support the United Irishmen that however had failed were regarded by Pitt as near-misses that could had potentially allowed the French to use Ireland as a base to conquer Britain, thus making the \"Irish Question\" into a key national security matter. As the Dublin parliament did not wish to disband itself, Pitt made generous use of what would now be called \"pork barrel politics\" to bribe the Irish MPs to vote for the Act of Union.\n\nDespite the efforts of Pitt and the British allies, the French continued to defeat the members of the First Coalition, which collapsed in 1798. A Second Coalition, consisting of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was formed, but it, too, failed to overcome the French. The fall of the Second Coalition with the defeat of the Austrians at the Marengo (14 June 1800) and at the Battle of Hohenlinden (3 December 1800) left Great Britain facing France alone.\n\nThe French Revolution revived religious and political problems in Ireland, a realm under the rule of the King of Great Britain. In 1798, Irish nationalists attempted a rebellion, believing that the French would help them overthrow the monarchy. Pitt firmly believed that the only solution to the problem was a union of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the defeat of the rebellion which was assisted by France, he advanced this policy. The union was established by the Acts of Union 1800; compensation and patronage ensured the support of the Irish Parliament. Great Britain and Ireland were formally united into a single realm, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, on 1 January 1801. The Irish Parliament was closed down.\nPitt sought to inaugurate the new kingdom by granting concessions to Roman Catholics, who formed a 75% majority in Ireland, by abolishing various political restrictions under which they suffered. The King was strongly opposed to Catholic Emancipation; he argued that to grant additional liberty would violate his coronation oath, in which he had promised to protect the established Church of England. Pitt, unable to change the King's strong views, resigned on 16 February 1801, so as to allow Henry Addington, his political friend, to form a new administration. At about the same time, however, the King suffered a renewed bout of madness, with the consequence that Addington could not receive his formal appointment. Though he had resigned, Pitt temporarily continued to discharge his duties; on 18 February 1801, he brought forward the annual budget. Power was transferred from Pitt to Addington on 14 March, when the King recovered.\n\nPitt supported the new administration, but with little enthusiasm; he frequently absented himself from Parliament, preferring to remain in his Lord Warden's residence of Walmer Castle – before 1802 usually spending an annual late-summer holiday there, and later often present from the spring until the autumn.\n\nFrom the castle, he helped organise a local Volunteer Corps in anticipation of a French invasion, acted as colonel of a battalion raised by Trinity House – he was also a Master of Trinity House – and encouraged the construction of Martello towers and the Royal Military Canal in Romney Marsh. He rented land abutting the Castle to farm, and on which to lay out trees and walks. His niece Lady Hester Stanhope designed and managed the gardens and acted as his hostess.\n\nThe Treaty of Amiens in 1801 between France and Britain marked the end of the French Revolutionary Wars. Everyone expected it to be only a short truce. By 1803, war had broken out again with France under Emperor Napoleon. Although Addington had previously invited him to join the Cabinet, Pitt preferred to join the Opposition, becoming increasingly critical of the government's policies. Addington, unable to face the combined opposition of Pitt and Fox, saw his majority gradually evaporate and resigned in late April 1804.\n\nPitt returned to the premiership on 10 May 1804. He had originally planned to form a broad coalition government, but faced the opposition of George III to the inclusion of Fox. Moreover, many of Pitt's former supporters, including the allies of Addington, joined the Opposition. Thus, Pitt's second ministry was considerably weaker than his first four.\n\nThe British Government began placing pressure on the French Emperor, Napoleon I. Thanks to Pitt's efforts, Britain joined the Third Coalition, an alliance that also involved Austria, Russia, and Sweden. In October 1805, the British Admiral, Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, won a crushing victory in the Battle of Trafalgar, ensuring British naval supremacy for the remainder of the war. At the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet toasting him as \"the Saviour of Europe\", Pitt responded In a few words that became the most famous speech of his life:\n\nNevertheless, the Coalition collapsed, having suffered significant defeats at the Battle of Ulm (October 1805) and the Battle of Austerlitz (December 1805). After hearing the news of Austerlitz Pitt referred to a map of Europe, \"Roll up that map; it will not be wanted these ten years.\"\n\nPitt was an expert in finance and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Critical to his success in confronting Napoleon was using Britain's superior economic resources. He was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million, Britain was barely half the size of France, which had a population of 30 million. In terms of soldiers, however, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.\n\nMost important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. By 1814, the budget that Pitt in his last years had largely shaped, had expanded to £66 million, including £10 million for the Navy, £40 million for the Army, £10 million for the Allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to £679 million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The whole cost of the war came to £831 million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.\n\nThe setbacks took a toll on Pitt's health. He had long suffered from poor health, beginning in childhood, and was plagued with gout and \"biliousness\" worsened by a fondness for port that began when he was advised to drink the wine to deal with his chronic ill-health. On 23 January 1806, Pitt died at Bowling Green House on Putney Heath, probably from peptic ulceration of his stomach or duodenum; he was unmarried and left no children.\n\nPitt's debts amounted to £40,000 when he died, but Parliament agreed to pay them on his behalf. A motion was made to honour him with a public funeral and a monument; it passed despite the opposition of Fox. Pitt's body was buried in Westminster Abbey on 22 February, having lain in state for two days in the Palace of Westminster. Pitt was succeeded as Prime Minister by his first cousin William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, who headed the Ministry of All the Talents, a coalition which included Charles James Fox.\n\nOf his social relationships, biographer William Hague writes: Pitt was happiest among his Cambridge companions or family. He had no social ambitions, and it was rare for him to set out to make a friend. The talented collaborators of his first 18 months in office—Beresford, Wyvil and Twining—passed in and out of his mind along with their areas of expertise. Pitt's lack of interest in enlarging his social circle meant that it did not grow to encompass any women outside his own family, a fact that produced a good deal of rumour. From late 1784, a series of satirical verses appeared in \"The Morning Herald\" drawing attention to Pitt's lack of knowledge of women: \"Tis true, indeed, we oft abuse him,/Because he bends to no man;/But slander's self dares not accuse him/Of stiffness to a woman.\"\nOthers made snide references to Pitt's friendship with Tom Steele, Secretary to the Treasury. At the height of the constitutional crisis in 1784, Sheridan had compared Pitt to James I's favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, a clear reference to homosexuality. Socially, Pitt preferred the company of young men, and would continue to do so into his thirties and forties. It may be that Pitt had homosexual leanings but suppressed any urge to act on them for the sake of his ambitions. He could be charming to women, but it seems certain that he rejected intimacy whenever it was proffered – and would do so publicly at a later date. In practical terms it appears that Pitt was essentially asexual throughout his life, perhaps one example of how his rapid development as a politician stunted his growth as a man.\n\nAt one point rumours emerged of an intended marriage to Eleanor Eden, to whom Pitt had grown close. Pitt broke off the potential marriage in 1797, writing to her father, Lord Auckland, \"I am compelled to say that I find the obstacles to it decisive and insurmountable\".\n\nPitt became known as a \"three-bottle man\" in reference to his heavy consumption of port wine. These bottles would be around 350 ml in volume.\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger was a powerful prime minister who consolidated the powers of his office. Though he was sometimes opposed by members of his Cabinet, he helped define the role of the Prime Minister as the supervisor and co-ordinator of the various Government departments. After his death the conservatives embraced him as a great patriotic hero.\n\nOne of Pitt's most important accomplishments was a rehabilitation of the nation's finances after the American War of Independence. Pitt helped manage the mounting national debt, and made changes to the tax system in order to improve its capture of revenue.\n\nSome of Pitt's other domestic plans were not as successful; he failed to secure parliamentary reform, emancipation, or the abolition of the slave trade, although this last did take place with the Slave Trade Act 1807 the year after his death. Biographer William Hague considers the unfinished abolition of the slave trade to be Pitt's greatest failure. He notes that by the end of Pitt's career, conditions were in place which would have allowed a skillful attempt to pass an abolition bill to succeed, in part due to the long campaigning Pitt had encouraged with his friend William Wilberforce. Hague goes on to note that the failure was likely due to Pitt being a \"spent force\" by the time favourable conditions had arisen. In Hague's opinion, Pitt's long premiership, \"tested the natural limits of how long it is possible to be at the top. From 1783 to 1792, he faced each fresh challenge with brilliance; from 1793 he showed determination but sometimes faltered; and from 1804 he was worn down by ... the combination of a narrow majority and war\".\n\nHistorian Marie Peters has compared his strengths and weaknesses with his father:\n\nWilliam Pitt is depicted in several films and television programs. Robert Donat portrays Pitt in the 1942 biopic \"The Young Mr Pitt\", which chronicles the historical events of Pitt's life. Pitt's attempts during his tenure as Prime Minister to cope with the dementia of King George III are portrayed by Julian Wadham in the 1994 film \"The Madness of King George\". The 2006 film \"Amazing Grace\", with Benedict Cumberbatch in the role of Pitt, depicts his close friendship with William Wilberforce, the leading abolitionist in Parliament. Pitt is caricatured as a boy-prime minister in the third series of the television comedy \"Blackadder\", in which Simon Osborne plays a fictionalized Pitt as a petulant teenager who has just come to power \"right in the middle of [his] exams\". In the series of prime ministerial biographies \"Number 10\", produced by Yorkshire Television, Pitt was portrayed by Jeremy Brett.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
