In 2007 the trust held €63 million in bank accounts and private equity with its international property holdings in Monaco, France, the United States and London having an estimated value of €130 million. The Ahsani family have a charitable organisation, Unakids. The Ahsani family control shell companies in the tax havens of the Channel Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the British Virgin Islands, through which Unaoil's business is conducted. In March 2016 \"The Age\" described Unaoil as \"the unseen intermediary in massive deals between the world's biggest energy companies and notoriously corrupt governments in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa.\" The family’s portfolio of real estate includes German nursing homes, and properties in multiple countries.\n\nAta Ahsani was born in 1940 in Kerman, Iran, and later studied engineering in England and the United States before working for an oil company in Iran.

{"id": "250196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250196", "title": "Alain de Botton", "text": "Alain de Botton\n\nAlain de Botton, FRSL (; born 20 December 1969) is a Swiss-born British philosopher and author. His books discuss various contemporary subjects and themes, emphasizing philosophy's relevance to everyday life. He published \"Essays in Love\" (1993), which went on to sell two million copies. Other bestsellers include \"How Proust Can Change Your Life\" (1997), \"Status Anxiety\" (2004) and \"The Architecture of Happiness\" (2006).\n\nHe co-founded The School of Life in 2008 and Living Architecture in 2009. In 2015, he was awarded \"The Fellowship of Schopenhauer\", an annual writers' award from the Melbourne Writers Festival, for this work.\n\nDe Botton was born in Zurich, the son of Jacqueline (née Burgauer) and Gilbert de Botton, who was born in Alexandria, Egypt, and expelled under Nasser. Gilbert went to live and work in Switzerland, where he co-founded an investment firm, Global Asset Management; his family was estimated to have been worth £234 million in 1999. Alain de Botton's Swiss-born mother was Ashkenazi, and his father was from a Sephardic Jewish family from the town of Boton in Castile and León.\n\nDe Botton's ancestors include Abraham de Boton. De Botton's paternal grandmother was Yolande Harmer. He has one sister, Miel, and they received a secular upbringing. Alain spent the first twelve years of his life in Switzerland where he was brought up speaking French and German.\n\nHe was sent to the Dragon School, a boarding school in Oxford, where English became his primary language. Describing himself as a shy child, he boarded at Harrow School, before going up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read History (1988–1991) and subsequently completed a master's degree (MPhil) in Philosophy at King's College, London (1991–1992). He began studying for a PhD in French philosophy at Harvard University, but gave up this research to write books for the general public.\n\nIn his first novel, \"Essays in Love\" (titled \"On Love\" in the U.S.), published in 1993, de Botton deals with the process of falling in and out of love. In 2010, \"Essays in Love\" was adapted to film by director Julian Kemp for the romantic comedy \"My Last Five Girlfriends\". De Botton wrote a sequel to \"Essays in Love\", published in 2016, titled \"The Course of Love\".\n\nIn 1997 he published his first non-fiction book, \"How Proust Can Change Your Life\", based on the life and works of Marcel Proust. It was a bestseller in both the US and UK.\n\nThis was followed by \"The Consolations of Philosophy\" in 2000. The title of the book is a reference to Boethius's \"Consolation of Philosophy\", in which philosophy appears as an allegorical figure to Boethius to console him in the period leading up to his impending execution. In \"The Consolations of Philosophy\", de Botton attempts to demonstrate how the teachings of philosophers such as Epicurus, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Seneca, and Socrates can be applied to modern everyday woes. The book has been both praised and criticized for its therapeutic approach to philosophy.\n\nIn 2004, he published \"Status Anxiety\".\n\nIn \"The Architecture of Happiness\" (2006), he discusses the nature of beauty in architecture and how it is related to the well-being and general contentment of the individual and society. He describes how architecture affects people every day, though people rarely pay particular attention to it. A good portion of the book discusses how human personality traits are reflected in architecture. He defends Modernist architecture, and chastises the pseudo-vernacular architecture of housing, especially in the UK. \"The best modern architecture,\" he argues, \"doesn't hold a mirror up to nature, though it may borrow a pleasing shape or expressive line from nature's copybook. It gives voice to aspirations and suggests possibilities. The question isn't whether you'd actually like to live in a Le Corbusier home, but whether you'd like to be the kind of person who'd like to live in one.\" \n\nIn \"The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work\" (2009), de Botton produced a survey of ten different jobs, including accountancy, rocket science and biscuit manufacture. The book, a piece of narrative non-fiction, includes two hundred original images and aims to unlock the beauty, interest and occasional horror of the modern world of work. After a negative review of the book by \"New York Times\" critic Caleb Crain, de Botton posted a scathing ad hominem attack against Crain. He later apologized for his remarks.\n\nIn August 2009, de Botton applied to a competition advertised among British literary agents by BAA, the airport management company, for the post of \"writer-in-residence\" at Heathrow Airport. The post involved being seated at a desk in Terminal 5, and writing about the comings and goings of passengers over a week. De Botton was duly appointed to the position. The result was the book, \"A Week at the Airport\", published by Profile Books in September 2009. The book features photographs by the documentary photographer Richard Baker, with whom de Botton also worked on \"The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work\".\n\nIn January 2012, de Botton published \"Religion for Atheists\", about the benefits of religions for those who do not believe in them. De Botton put it: \"It's clear to me that religions are in the end too complex, interesting and on occasion wise to be abandoned simply to those who believe in them\". In April 2012, he published \"How to Think More about Sex\", one in a series of six books on topics of emotional life published by his enterprise, \"The School of Life\". \n\nIn October 2013, he published \"Art as Therapy\", co-written with the Australian-Scottish art historian, John Armstrong. \"Art as Therapy\" argues that certain great works of art \"offer clues on managing the tensions and confusions of everyday life\".\n\nIn February 2014, de Botton published his fourteenth book, a title called \"\", a study of the effects of the news on modern mentality, viewed through the prism of 25 news stories, culled from a variety of sources, which de Botton analyses in detail. The book delved with more rigour into de Botton's analyses of the modern media which appeared in \"Status Anxiety\".\n\nDe Botton used to write articles for several English newspapers, and from 1998 to 2000, wrote a regular column for \"The Independent on Sunday\". He travels extensively to lecture and has his own production company, Seneca Productions, which makes television documentaries based upon his works. He has given lectures at TED conferences. In July 2011, he spoke in Edinburgh about \"Atheism 2.0\", an idea of atheism that also incorporates our human need for connection, ritual and transcendence. In July 2009, he spoke at Oxford University about the philosophy of failure and success, and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments.\n\nDe Botton has written in a variety of formats to mixed response. Positive reviews of his books attest that he has made literature, philosophy and art more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nNegative reviews allege that de Botton tends to state the obvious and have characterized some of his books as pompous and lacking focus.\n\nIn response to a question about whether he felt \"pulled\" to be a writer, de Botton responded:So I think where people tend to end up results from a combination of encouragement, accident, and lucky break, etc. etc. Like many others, my career happened like it did because certain doors opened and certain doors closed. You know, at a certain point I thought it would be great to make film documentaries. Well, in fact, I found that to be incredibly hard and very expensive to do and I didn’t really have the courage to keep battling away at that. In another age, I might have been an academic in a university, if the university system had been different. So it's all about trying to find the best fit between your talents and what the world can offer at that point in time.\n\nIn 2008, Alain de Botton founded The School of Life. Based in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Seoul, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, São Paulo, Berlin, Zurich and Melbourne, The School of Life offers an emotional education focusing in particular on the issues of Work and Relationships. In an interview with Metkere.com de Botton said:The idea is to challenge traditional universities and reorganise knowledge, directing it towards life, and away from knowledge for its own sake. In a modest way, it’s an institution that is trying to give people what universities should I think always give them: a sense of direction and wisdom for their lives with the help of culture.\n\nIn May 2009, de Botton launched a project called \"Living Architecture\" – which builds holiday rental houses in the UK using leading contemporary architects. These include Peter Zumthor, MVRDV, JVA, NORD and Michael and Patti Hopkins. The most recent house to be announced is a collaboration between the Turner-prize winning artist Grayson Perry, and the architecture firm FAT. The houses are rented out to the general public. De Botton, the creative director and chairman of Living Architecture, aims to improve the appreciation of good contemporary architecture – a task which is the practical continuation of his theoretical work on architecture in his book \"The Architecture of Happiness\". In October 2009, he was appointed an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in recognition of his services to architecture.\n\nIn 2014, de Botton was invited by three museums – the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto – to contribute content to special exhibitions based on his work, \"Art as Therapy\". De Botton and his colleague John Armstrong inserted captions, arranged on large Post-it-style labels designed by the Dutch Graphic artist, Irma Boom, bearing slogans and commentary on exhibits throughout the Rijksmuseum.\n\nDe Botton has described his relationship with his father as difficult, stating: \"When I sold my first bestseller (and a million dollars was peanuts for my father) he was not impressed and wondered what I was going to do with myself.\" When his father died, his family was left a large trust fund, although de Botton says his income is derived solely from his own activities (book sales, speaking engagements, business consulting, The School of Life). Alain's stepmother Janet de Botton is a prominent patron of the arts and competition bridge player. De Botton lives in London with his wife, Charlotte, and their two children.\n\nIn August 2014, de Botton was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to \"The Guardian\" opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011 he presented a series of talks for the BBC Radio 4 series \"A Point of View\".\n\n"}

{"id": "30423543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30423543", "title": "Charles Newton (inventor)", "text": "Charles Newton (inventor)\n\nA lawyer and firearm enthusiast, Charles (Chas.) Newton's experiments with cartridge design led to the creation of the .22 Savage Hi-Power rifle cartridge which was adopted by the Savage Arms Corporation as a commercial firearm cartridge. This success was soon followed by the design of the .250-3000 Savage. At this period in time, Charles also experimented with wildcats based on the .30-06 Springfield case, most notably creating a forerunner of the .25-06 Remington. This cartridge was first introduced as the .25 Newton Special. There were probably no firearms produced in this caliber by Netwon. It soon evolved into the .256 Newton designed to use, at first, a 123 grain bullet followed by later upgrades to 129 grain and 140 grain bullets. Newton's premise was to use a large case for each caliber he developed in order for the larger powder charge to propel the bullet at high velocity resulting in effective terminal ballistics. Newton developed several calibers. The best known are the .22 Newton (90 grain bullet), .256 Newton, .30 Newton (180 grain bullet), .33 Newton (200 grain bullet), .35 Newton (250 grain bullet) and .40 Newton (300 grain bullet). From 1914 until the late 1920s, he entered into various endeavours to promote and sell rifles in his proprietary calibers.\n\nTo promote his proprietary cartridges and ensure a supply of high-quality rifles capable of safely withstanding the high chamber pressure developed by them, Charles incorporated the Newton Arms Co. Inc. in 1914. The earliest of many catalogs issued by Newton offered Mauser and Sauer- Mauser rifles converted, probably by Fred Adolph, to Adolph and Newton calibers. Fred Adolph was a gunsmith in Genoa, New York. He and Newton worked together to design some of the early calibers. These cartridges were initially named Adolph calibers and later named using Newton in place of Adolph. In 1914, Charles Newton made arrangements with Mauser to import rifles in 6.5 caliber in order to convert them in the US to .256 Newton. One order of 24 rifles arrived in August 1914 and three more orders were never received due to the start of World War I. The outbreak of World War I led Charles to manufacture his own rifles. With the employment of noted barrel-maker and gunsmith Harry Pope, Newton assured his rifles would be of the highest quality. These First Model 1916 rifles were made in Buffalo, New York. Due to financial difficulties and the inability to make ammunition because of the war efforts, the company produced rifles under Newton for 16 months. In this time, about 2,400 rifles were manufactured. Newton Arms Co. Inc. went into receivership for the next 98 days. The receiver then sold out to a dealer in used factory equipment who in turn sold the equipment and left over rifles to the Newton Arms Corporation based in New York, New York. They were also in business about 16 months, were sued by Newton and sold the remaining rifles to Kirkland Bros. Hardware. Approximately 1,600 rifles were sold by Newton's successors making the total number of Model 1916s produced equal 4000 rifles.\nNewton started the Chas. Newton Rifle Co. in 1919 and imported about 100 German made Sauer-Mauser rifles, all in .256 Newton caliber. This model is known as the Model 1922 Newton.\nThe Buffalo Newton Rifle Co. was organized in 1923 for the purpose of manufacturing a newly designed rifle. The first rifles were made in 1924 and became the Second Model 1924 Buffalo Newton rifle. The factory was in New Haven, Connecticut. Only about 1,000 of this model Newton rifle were produced.\nCharles Newton's last attempt at rifle manufacture was the LeverBolt rifle which never reached production status and only prototypes were made. \nNewton's innovative rifle and cartridge designs contributed much to the firearms industry and some of his developments are used today by rifle makers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4173789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4173789", "title": "Cornelius Stirk", "text": "Cornelius Stirk\n\nCornelius Stirk is a fictional character in DC Comics.\n\nHe first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #592 (November 1988) and was created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle.\n\nStirk is a supervillain who, like Scarecrow, uses fear to get to his victims. Stirk has the ability to make other people see him as someone else, allowing him to get close to his victims. He operates under the delusion that he requires the nutrients and hormones from peoples' hearts in order to stay alive, and these are best prepared with norepinephrine by inducing fear in the victim prior to death.\n\nIn his first appearance, Stirk is released from Arkham Asylum after being certified as sane. He had been confined since the age of 16 for trying to kill a classmate. After his release, Stirk subsequently stops taking his medication and begins his escalation into a serial killer.\n\nDespite his many murders, Stirk professes to dislike violence. He also dislikes light and therefore operates almost exclusively at night. Oddly, he refers to almost everyone as \"sir\".\n\nStirk makes a brief cameo in the beginning of the four-part storyline \"\", where Jeremiah Arkham, Arkham Asylum's new director, utilizes more barbaric methods to \"cure\" him. When Stirk refuses to take his medication, for instance, Jeremiah has two orderlies brutally beat him with billy clubs and forces the medication down his throat.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Stirk works with the Joker in an attempt to kidnap Commissioner Gordon. However, Stirk tries to kill Gordon rather than kidnap him, much to Joker's dismay. Gordon hallucinates that Stirk is actually Batman as Stirk tried to kill Gordon with a knife. Batman stops Stirk, but Gordon is still screaming in fear. In order to capture Stirk, Batman is forced to leave a terrified Gordon with his wife, who brings him to a hospital.\n\nStirk later appears during the \"Madmen Across the Water\" storyline, taking place after his capture but before Arkham Asylum (destroyed by Bane beforehand) is rebuilt. He, along with the likes of Riddler, Ivy, and Amygdala, are instead incarcerated in Blackgate Penitentiary, and involve themselves in a softball game with the prison's \"normal\" criminals. During the game, Stirk is revealed to be an excellent pitcher, because the ball feels \"just like a human heart\".\n\nStirk makes several more cameos in the \"Waxman and the Clown\" story arc (\"Shadow of the Bat\" #80–82), itself part of the \"Road to No Man's Land\" crossover, the prequel to \"No Man's Land\". He is seen in the story arc offering to eat human hearts to save medication (as Arkham Asylum, in post-earthquake lockdown after the \"Cataclysm\" storyline, is running short of supplies). He later watches the gladiatorial match between fellow inmates Killer Croc and Pinhead, and is released with all the other inmates under Jeremiah's demand that none of them return to Gotham.\n\nStirk returns in Kevin Smith's storyline, \"\". Stirk gets the drop on a distracted Batman but Robin manages to save Batman.\n\nCornelius Stirk is able to cast a hypnotic aura which allows him to take on any face he chooses, generally a face that people will trust.\n\nCornelius Stirk appears in the \"Gotham\" episode \"Wrath of the Villains: A Legion of Horribles,\" portrayed by Kameron Omidian. Just like the comics, he has a cannibalistic personality. He appears as Edward Nygma's cellmate at Arkham Asylum after his breakout attempt failed. Both of them are chained up in the same cell. To evade Stirk from breaking out and eating him, Nygma asked Ethel Peabody to contact Hugo Strange about a deal to stop James Gordon.\n\n\n"}

He was among the engineers who surrendered to the United States and traveled there, providing rocketry expertise via Operation Paperclip, which took them first to Fort Bliss, Texas. Grau was sent by the U.S. Army to White Sands in 1946 to work on the assemblage (with parts shipped from Germany) and testing of the V-2. His wife joined him there in 1947 (Grau's son was born in Texas in 1949). While von Braun was on standby at Fort Bliss, Grau and other German aerospace engineers busily launched V-2s for U.S. scientists to analyze. A total of 67 V-2s were launched at White Sands.\n\nHe continued his work with the team when they moved to the Redstone Arsenal (Alabama), and then joined the Marshall Space Flight Center to work for NASA in 1950. Grau served as the director of quality in all of those assignments, including the Saturn V program which took mankind to the moon.\n\nGrau said that von Braun worked closely with then-Colonel Holger Toftoy to develop the kind of team he wanted in the U.S.\n\n\"One of my main jobs at that time was to get information to the scientists and see what kind of projects they would like to have and then, of course, we had to accommodate them,\" Grau recalled. \"Even though we were busy, we were more used to much overtime. But that was not the case (at White Sands). There we had a normal workday.\"\nThings changed with their arrival in Huntsville. In many ways the Germans felt like they were coming home. Gone were the dry, desert conditions of Fort Bliss and White Sands, replaced with a green, mountainous agricultural area reminiscent of Germany. Grau noted:\n\n\"The new Redstone rocket had to go somewhat further. It had to be bigger and it had to be made with American parts,\" Grau said.\n\nGrau, along with von Braun's team, moved from the Army to NASA to develop the first rockets designed expressly for exploration. Grau oversaw quality assurance for the development of the Saturn I and Saturn V rockets. Ed Buckbee, formerly of MSFC public affairs, said of this time, \"When Dieter spoke, everybody in the room listened.\"\n\n\"We had wonderful experiences going into space. We had wonderful cooperation to accomplish something never done before,\" Grau said.\n\nGrau died in Huntsville, Alabama, at the age of 101 on December 17, 2014.\n"}

He was a three-time winner at both the London Marathon and Berlin Marathon between 2015 and 2018. Described as \"the greatest marathoner of the modern era\", Kipchoge has won 11 of the 12 marathons he has entered, his only loss being to Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich at the 2013 Berlin Marathon (Kipchoge placed second), where Kipsang broke the world record.\n\nKipchoge was born on 5 November 1984 in Kapsisiywa, Nandi District of Kenya. Kipchoge graduated from Kaptel Secondary School in 1999 but did not run seriously then. He did run two miles to school on a daily basis. Kipchoge was raised by a single mother (a teacher), and only knew his father from pictures. He is the youngest of four children. He met his trainer Patrick Sang (a former Olympic medalist in the steeplechase) in 2001 at the age of 16.\n\nKipchoge lives with his wife and 3 children in Eldoret, Kenya.\n\nIn 2002, he won at the Kenyan trials for the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships junior race. At the World Cross Country Championships, held in Dublin, Kipchoge finished fifth in the individual race and was part of the Kenyan junior team that won gold. Kipchoge also won the 5000 metres race at the Kenyan trial for the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics, but got ill and missed the championships. At the 2003 IAAF World Cross Country Championships he won the junior race.\n\nHe set a world junior record in the 5000 m at the 2003 Bislett Games, running a time of 12:52.61 minutes. This stood as the world and African junior record until 2012, when it was improved to 12:47.53 minutes by Hagos Gebrhiwet of Ethiopia.\n\nIn July he participated in the Golden League 2004 Roma Meeting. In the 5000 m event, he dipped first among the starters with 12:46.53, which made him the sixth-fastest ever in the event.\n\nKipchoge won a gold medal at the 5000 m final at the 2003 World Championships, outsprinting both future world record holder Kenenisa Bekele and runner-up Hicham El Guerrouj (the world record holder in the 1500 metres and mile) by four hundredths of a second (12:52.79 vs. 12:52.83).\n\nIn 2004, Kipchoge won a bronze medal at the 5000 m final at the 2004 Athens Olympics, behind El Guerrouj and Kenenisa Bekele. He also won the Trofeo Alasport cross country race earlier that season.\n\nKipchoge won the bronze in the 3000 metres indoor at the 2006 World Championships in Moscow. At the end of the year, he ran at the San Silvestre Vallecana New Year's Eve 10 km road race and he just held off Zersenay Tadese to win in a time of 26:54 minutes. This was better than the world record, but the time was assisted by the downhill course.\n\nKipchoge won a silver medal at the 5000 m final of the 2007 World Championships at Osaka in 13:46.00, behind Bernard Lagat (13:45.87).\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics held in Beijing, China, Kipchoge won a silver medal in the 5000m event with a time of 13:02.80; although better than the previous Olympic record of 13:05.59, it was not enough to match Kenenisa Bekele's pace, who won the gold medal for this race. He failed to reach the podium at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, finishing in fifth place and he also finished ninth in the 3000 m at the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final. On the circuit, he won the Great Yorkshire Run 10K and Campaccio Cross Country that year.\nAs the prerace favorite, during the 2016 Summer Olympics, Kipchoge gained a gold medal in the marathon event. On the last day of the Rio Olympics on 21 August 2016 he won in a time of 2:08:44. The runner up was Feyisa Lilesa (Ethiopia) 2:09:54 and the bronze medal went to Galen Rupp (USA), doing his second marathon, crossing the finish line in 2:10:05. When the halfway point after 21.0975 km was reached, 37 men where within 10 seconds of the lead runner. The participants field diminished to 3 lead runners shortly before 34 km. Kipchoge made his final move on silver medal winner Lilesa around 36 km into the race. He covered the first half of the race in 65:55, while doing the second half in 62:49, that amounts to a difference of more than 3 minutes, a negative split. The winning gap between Kipchoge and Lilesa by 70 seconds is the largest victory margin since the 1972 Olympic marathon. Kipchoge's wining time of 2:08:44 is his slowest marathon time (as of Sep 2018). One hundred fifty-five runners started the race, which amounted to the largest field in Olympic history; 139 of them finished the race. With this win, Kipchoge became the second Kenyan male after Sammy Wanjiru in Beijing 2008 to win an Olympic marathon gold medal. At the same Olympics, the women marathon was one by another Kenyan, Jemima Sumgong.\n\nHe made his debut on the 2010 IAAF Diamond League by winning the 5000 m Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix in a meet record time.\n\nKipchoge then went on to enter the Carlsbad 5000 in CA, USA. The Carlsbad 5 km road race is the venue for the world best times for a 5k road race for men and women respectively. The fastest to cover the track was Sammy Kipketer in 2000, with 12:59.5 min. Kipchoge made a world best attempt and although he won the race, weather affected his chances and he finished in 13:11, the fourth-fastest ever for the course up to that point in time.\n\nIn the first athletics final of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he attempted to win the 5000 m Commonwealth title. Ugandan runner Moses Kipsiro held a slender lead over him in the final stages of the race and Kipchoge ended up in second place, taking the silver medal some seven hundredths of a second behind. He flew back to Europe immediately after to take part in the Belgrade Race through History the following day. His shoe fell off in the first kilometre and, after putting it back on, he made up much ground on the field to eventually take second place two seconds behind Josphat Menjo.\n\nAt the start of 2011, he won the short race at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country, ahead of Asbel Kiprop. He attempted to retain his title at the Carlsbad 5000 in April but came a close second behind Dejen Gebremeskel. In May he raced the 3000 metres (finished third) in Doha, with a time of 7:27.66 and ranked him as the 12th-fastest at the distance up to this point. Kipchoge was chosen to represent Kenya at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and reached the 5000 m final for the fifth consecutive time, although he only managed seventh place on this occasion.\n\n2012\n\nKipchoge returned to the Edinburgh Cross Country in 2012, but this time he finished third behind Asbel Kiprop and Britain's Jonathan Hay. He was also third at the Carlsbad 5000 in March. He attempted to gain a place on the 10,000 m Olympic team at the Prefontaine Classic, but fell back in the late stages of the Kenyan trial race, finishing seventh. A seventh-place finish in the Kenyan 5000 m trial race meant he would not make a third consecutive Olympic team.\n\nHe made his half marathon debut in the Lille Half Marathon. The run was won by a new course record time of 59:05 (previously 59:36 by ilahun Regassa set in 2008) from Ezekiel Chebii (former pb 59:22), trailed by Bernard Koech 59:10, and Kipchoge earned a third place with 59:25. His time of 59:25 became the second fastest Half Marathon debut, only second to Moses Mosop's 59:20 in Milan in 2010.\n\nKipchoge entered the 2012 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and placed sixth.\n\n2013\n\nKipchoge opened his 2013 season with a win at the Barcelona Half Marathon in a time of one hour and four seconds. Making his marathon debut in April, he demonstrated a smooth transition to the longer distance by taking the Hamburg Marathon title with a run of 2:05:30 hours—beating the field by over two minutes and setting a new course record. In August 2013, he won the Half Marathon of Klagenfurt in 61:02 minutes.\n\nThen, he raced in the Berlin Marathon and he finished second in 2:04:05, the fifth-fastest time in history, behind Wilson Kipsang, who set a new marathon world record with 2:03:23. The third place went to Geoffrey Kipsang (Kenia) with 2:06:26. This made him the fifth-fastest marathon runner in history, in his second ever marathon.\n\n2015\n\nKipchoge won the Berlin Marathon in 2015. His win and then-personal-best time (2:04:00) occurred even though his shoes malfunctioned, causing his insoles to flap out of both shoes from 10 km onward; rather than risk time lost from an adjustment, he finished the race with bloodied, blistered feet.\n\n2016\n\nIn April 2016, Kipchoge won the London Marathon for the second consecutive year in a time of 2:03:05. His performance broke the course record in London, and became the second-fastest marathon time in history, missing Dennis Kimetto's world record by 8 seconds.\n\nOn 20 November 2016, Kipchoge ran in the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon, winning the race clocking a time of 59:44.\n\n2017\n\nOn 6 May 2017, Kipchoge, along with Zersenay Tadese (world record holder in the half marathon) and Lelisa Desisa (2 time Boston Marathon winner) attempted the first sub-two-hour assisted marathon, in the Nike Breaking2 project on the Monza Formula 1 racetrack near Milan, Italy. It was paced by a lead car and supporting runners joining in stages (both considered illegal under IAAF rules). The race started at 5:45h local time on the 2.4 km track. Kipchoge finished in 2:00:25, while the other two had to slow and finished far behind. The runners planned even 14:13 5k splits to break 2 hours. His 5k splits were: 14:14, 14:07, 14:13, 14:15, 14:14, 14:17, 14:17, 14:27, and 6:20 to finish. The 5k split times from 25k and further would be world records: 25k in 1:11:03, 30k in 1:25:20, 35k in 1:39:37, 40k in 1:54:04.\n\nOn 24 September 2017, he won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:03:32.\nIn rainy conditions, he finished 14 seconds ahead of Guye Adola who ran his first marathon.\nAdola set the fastest marathon debut ever.\nFormer marathon world record holder Wilson Kipsang and 2016 winner Kenenisa Bekele failed to finish.\n\n2018\n\nKipchoge won the 2018 London Marathon against a field that included Mo Farah (4 time Olympic gold medalist), who finished third with a time of 2:06:32 in his second marathon, Kenenisa Bekele (3 time Olympic gold medalist + World Record holder 5000 m and 10000 m), and defending champion Daniel Wanjiru.\n\nOn 16 September 2018, Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:39, breaking the previous world record by 1 minute and 18 seconds (2:02:57 set by fellow countryman Dennis Kimetto at the Berlin Marathon in 2014). In statements before the race, he said, he planned to run a new personal best. He finished 4:43 min ahead of second placed fellow Kenyan Amos Kipruto. The World Record holder from 2013, Wilson Kipsang of Kenia, came in third in 2:06:48. From 2003 onwards, all previous 6 world records in the men's marathon were set at the Berlin marathon. Kipchoge began the race with three pacemakers dedicated to him. After 5 km in the run, the gap between him and the Kipsang group was 9 seconds. After 15 km in the race, two of the pacemakers were unable to continue pacing him. The remaining pacemaker dropped out after 25 kilometers, leaving Kipchoge to cover the final 17 km alone. Kipchoge had planned to run with a pacemaker though 30 km (rather than 25 km); this adversity \"was unfortunate,\" he reflected post-race, \"but I had to believe\". Kipchoge accelerated, covering the second half (1:00:34) of the race faster than the first half (1:01:06). In sunny weather conditions, the temperature was 14 °C (57 °F) during the start and 18 °C (64 °F) when Kipchoge crossed the finish line.\n\nThe prize money Kipchoge made for his Berlin run altogether was 120.000 €. This comes down to 30.000 € for finishing in less than 2:04 hours, 40.000 for his win and additionally 50.000 € for a new world record. The world record done during this run is the 8th world record in the men's marathon at the Berlin marathon in a 20 years timeframe.\n\nThe pace during the run averaged to a 2:53/km or 4:38/mile. The second half of the race in 60:34 is faster than all but three American half-marathon times (the last 10k was covered in 28:33.). It was the most evenly paced marathon ever run, with the fastest 5k Intervall covered in 14:18 and the slowest in 14:37, a difference of 19 seconds. His split times during his world record were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "86692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86692", "title": "Emiliano Zapata", "text": "Emiliano Zapata\n\nEmiliano Zapata Salazar (; 8 August 1879 – 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called \"Zapatismo\".\n\nZapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Díaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning \"hacendados\", and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South, of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Zapata's forces contributed to the fall of Díaz, defeating the Federal Army in the Battle of Cuautla, but when the revolutionary leader Francisco I. Madero became president he disavowed the role of the Zapatistas, denouncing them as simple bandits. In November 1911, Zapata promulgated the Plan de Ayala which called for substantial land reforms, redistributing lands to the peasants. Madero sent the Federal Army to root out the Zapatistas in Morelos. Madero's generals employed a scorched earth policy, burning villages and forcibly removing their inhabitants, and drafting many men into the Army or sending them to forced labor camps in southern Mexico. This strengthened Zapata's standing among the peasants, and Zapata was able to drive the forces of Madero led by Victoriano Huerta out of Morelos. In a coup against Madero in February 1913, Huerta took power in Mexico, but a coalition of Constitutionalist forces in northern Mexico led by Venustiano Carranza, Álvaro Obregón and Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa ousted him in July 1914 with the support of Zapata's troops. Zapata did not recognize the authority that Carranza asserted as leader of the revolutionary movement, continuing his adherence to the Plan de Ayala.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolutionaries' victory over Huerta, they attempted to sort out power relations in the Convention of Aguascalientes. Zapata and Villa broke with Carranza, and Mexico descended into civil war among the winners. Dismayed with the alliance with Villa, Zapata focused his energies on rebuilding society in Morelos which he now controlled, instituting the land reforms of the Plan de Ayala. As Carranza consolidated his power and defeated Villa in 1915, Zapata initiated guerrilla warfare against the Carrancistas, who in turn invaded Morelos, employing once again scorched-earth tactics to oust the Zapatista rebels. Zapata once again retook Morelos in 1917 and held most of the state against Carranza's troops until he was killed in an ambush in April 1919. Article 27 of the 1917 Mexican Constitution was drafted in response to his agrarian demands.\n\nAfter his death, Zapatista generals aligned with Obregón against Carranza and helped drive Carranza from power. In 1920, Zapatistas managed to obtain powerful posts in the governance of Morelos after Carranza's fall. They instituted many of the land reforms envisioned by Zapata in Morelos.\n\nZapata remains an iconic figure in Mexico, used both as a nationalist symbol as well as a symbol of the neo-Zapatista movement.\n\nEmiliano Zapata was born to Gabriel Zapata and Cleofas Jertrudiz Salazar of Anenecuilco, Morelos, a well-known local family; Emiliano's godfather was the manager of a large local hacienda, and his godmother was the manager's wife. Zapata's family were mestizos, Mexicans of Nahua and Spanish ancestry. Emiliano was the ninth of ten children; his older brother Eufemio Zapata is also a figure in Morelos history. From a family of farmers, Emiliano Zapata had insight into the severe difficulties of the countryside and his village's long struggle to regain land taken by expanding haciendas.\n\nHe received a limited education from his teacher, Emilio Vara, but it included \"the rudiments of bookkeeping\". At the age of 16 or 17, Zapata had to care for his family following his father's death. Emiliano was entrepreneurial, buying a team of mules to haul maize from farms to town, as well as bricks to the Hacienda of Chinameca; he was also a successful farmer, growing watermelons as a cash crop. He was a skilled horseman and competed in rodeos and races, as well as bullfighting from horseback. These skills as a horseman brought him work as a horse trainer for Porfirio Díaz's son-in-law, who had a hacienda nearby, and served Zapata well as a revolutionary leader. He had a striking appearance, with a large mustache in which he took pride, and good quality clothing described by a comrade: \"General Zapata's dress until his death was a \"charro\" outfit: tight-fitting black cashmere pants with silver buttons, a broad charro hat, a fine linen shirt or jacket, a scarf around his neck, boots of a single piece, Amozoqueña-style spurs, and a pistol at his belt.\" In an undated studio photo, Zapata is dressed in a standard business suit and tie, projecting an image of a man of means.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Anenecuilco was a mixed Spanish-speaking mestizo and indigenous Nahuatl-speaking pueblo. It had a long history of protesting the local haciendas taking community members' land, and its leaders gathered colonial-era documentation of their land titles to prove their claims. Some of the colonial documentation was in Nahuatl, with contemporary translations to Spanish for use in legal cases in the Spanish courts. One eyewitness account by Luz Jiménez of Milpa Alta states that Emiliano Zapata spoke Nahuatl fluently when his forces arrived in her community.\n\nAfter Porfirio Díaz came to the presidency of Mexico by a coup in 1876, the Mexican social and economic system was dominated by large estates \"(haciendas)\" controlling much of the land and squeezing the holdings of independent communities. Many peasants were subsequently forced into debt peonage (\"peonaje\") on the \"haciendas\". Díaz ran local elections to give the semblance of democracy; however, his close confidants and associates were given offices in districts throughout Mexico. These officials became enforcers of changes in land tenure that favored the concentration of land progressively into the hands of fewer and wealthier landowners. Community members in Anenecuilco, including Zapata, sought redress against land seizures. In 1892, a delegation had an audience with Díaz, who with the intervention of a lawyer, agreed to hear them. Although promising them to deal favorably with their petition, Díaz had them arrested and Zapata was conscripted into the Federal Army. Under Díaz, conscription into the Federal Army was much feared by ordinary Mexican men and their families. Zapata was one of many rebel leaders who were conscripted at some point.\n\nIn 1909, an important meeting was called by the elders of Anenecuilco, whose chief elder was José Merino. He announced \"my intention to resign from my position due to my old age and limited abilities to continue the fight for the land rights of the village.\" The meeting was used as a time for discussion and nomination of individuals as a replacement for Merino as the president of the village council. The elders on the council were so well respected by the village men that no one would dare to override their nominations or vote for an individual against the advice of the current council at that time. The nominations made were Modesto González, Bartolo Parral, and Emiliano Zapata. After the nominations were closed, a vote was taken and Zapata became the new council president without contest.\n\nAlthough Zapata had turned 30 only a month before, voters knew that it was necessary to elect someone respected by the community who would be responsible for the village. Even though he was relatively young, Anenecuilco was ready to hand over the leadership to him without any worry of failure. Before he was elected he had shown the village his nature by helping to head up a campaign in opposition to the candidate Díaz had chosen governor. Even though Zapata's efforts failed, he was able to create and cultivate relationships with political authority figures that would prove useful for him.\n\nZapata became a leading figure in the village of Anenecuilco, where his family had lived for many generations, and he became involved in struggles for the rights of the \"campesinos\" of Morelos. He was able to oversee the redistribution of the land from some \"haciendas\" peacefully but had problems with others. He observed numerous conflicts between villagers and \"hacendados\", or landowners, over the constant theft of village land, and in one instance, saw the \"hacendados\" torch an entire villa.\n\nFor many years, he campaigned steadfastly for the rights of the villagers, first establishing via ancient title deeds their claims to disputed land, and then pressing the recalcitrant governor of Morelos into action. Finally, disgusted with the slow response from the government and the overt bias towards the wealthy plantation owners, Zapata began making use of armed force, simply taking over the land in dispute.\n\nThe flawed 1910 elections were a major reason for the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Porfirio Díaz was being threatened by the candidacy of Francisco I. Madero. Zapata, seeing an opportunity to promote land reform in Mexico, made quiet alliances with Madero, whom he perceived to be the best chance for genuine change in the country. Although he was wary about Madero, Zapata cooperated with him when Madero made vague promises about land reform in his Plan of San Luis Potosí. Land reform was the central feature of Zapata's political vision.. He also fought the Mexican Revolution with Pancho Villa. These two people fought to help the peasants get their land back until they both got killed by the government. At the end of the Mexican revolution, the government passed down the Mexican Constitution which it basically gave the land back to the peasants, universal suffrage, supported public education, the minimum wage for Mexicans, and maximum hours restrictions. \n\nZapata joined Madero's campaign against President Diaz. When Zapata's army captured Cuautla after a six-day battle on May 19, 1911, it became clear that Diaz would not hold on to power for long. With the support of Pancho Villa, Pascual Orozco, Emiliano Zapata, and rebellious peasants, Madero overthrew Díaz in May 1911 at the Battle of Ciudad Juárez. A provisional government was formed under Francisco León de la Barra. Under Madero, some new land reforms were carried out and elections were to be ensured. However, Zapata was dissatisfied with Madero's stance on land reform, which Madero did not really believe in, and was unable, despite repeated efforts, to make him understand the importance of the issue or to get him to act on it.\n\nMadero was not ready to create a radical change in the manner that agrarian relations operated during this time. Some other individuals, called \"anarcho-syndicalist agitators\", had made promises to take things back to the way that they had been done previously. The major method of agrarian relations had been that of communal lands, called \"ejidos\". Although some believed that this could be the best course of action, Madero simply demanded that \"Public servants act 'morally' in enforcing the law ...\". Upon seeing the response by villagers, Madero offered formal justice in courts to individuals who had been wronged by others with regard to agrarian politics. Zapata decided that on the surface it seemed as though Madero was doing good things for the people of Mexico, but Zapata did not know the level of sincerity in Madero's actions and thus did not know if he should support him completely.\n\nMadero and Zapata's relations worsened during the summer of 1911 as Madero appointed a governor who supported plantation owners and refused to meet Zapata's agrarian demands. Compromises between the two failed in November 1911, days after Madero was elected President. Zapata and Otilio Montaño Sánchez, a former school teacher, fled to the mountains of southwest Puebla. There they formed the most radical reform plan in Mexico; the Plan de Ayala (Plan of Ayala). The plan declared Madero a traitor, named Pascual Orozco head of the Revolution, and outlined a plan for true land reform.\n\nThe Plan of Ayala called for all lands stolen under Díaz to be immediately returned; there had been considerable land fraud under the old dictator, so a great deal of territory was involved. It also stated that large plantations owned by a single person or family should have one-third of their land nationalized, which would then be required to be given to poor farmers. It also argued that if any large plantation owner resisted this action, they should have the other two-thirds confiscated as well. The Plan of Ayala also invoked the name of Benito Juárez, one of Mexico's great leaders, and compared the taking of land from the wealthy to Juarez's actions when he took land from the church in the 1860s.\n\nZapata was partly influenced by an anarchist from Oaxaca named Ricardo Flores Magón. The influence of Flores Magón on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatistas' Plan de Ayala, but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) \"Tierra y libertad\" (\"land and liberty\"), the title and maxim of Flores Magón's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via Montaño Sánchez – later a general in Zapata's army, executed on May 17, 1917 (by order of Zapata) – who exposed Zapata to the works of Peter Kropotkin and Flores Magón at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.\n\nThe plan proclaimed the Zapatista demands for \"Reforma, Libertad, Ley y Justicia\" (Reform, Freedom, Law and Justice). Zapata also declared the Maderistas as a counter-revolution and denounced Madero. Zapata mobilized his Liberation Army and allied with former Maderistas Pascual Orozco and Emiliano Vázquez Gómez. Orozco was from Chihuahua, near the U.S. border, and thus was able to aid the Zapatistas with a supply of arms.\n\nIn the following weeks, the development of military operations \"betray(ed) good evidence of clear and intelligent planning.\" During Orozco's rebellion, Zapata fought Mexican troops in the south near Mexico City. In the original design of the armed force, Zapata was a mere colonel among several others; however, the true plan that came about through this organization lent itself to Zapata. Zapata believed that the best route of attack would be to center the fighting and action in Cuautla. If this political location could be overthrown, the army would have enough power to \"veto anyone else's control of the state, negotiate for Cuernavaca or attack it directly, and maintain independent access to Mexico City as well as escape routes to the southern hills.\" However, in order to gain this great success, Zapata realized that his men needed to be better armed and trained.\n\nThe first line of action demanded that Zapata and his men \"control the area behind and below a line from Jojutla to Yecapixtla.\" When this was accomplished it gave the army the ability to complete raids as well as wait. As the opposition of the Federal Army and police detachments slowly dissipated, the army would be able to eventually gain powerful control over key locations on the Interoceanic Railway from Puebla City to Cuautla. If these feats could be completed, it would gain access to Cuautla directly and the city would fall.\n\nThe plan of action was carried out successfully in Jojutla. However, Pablo Torres Burgos, the commander of the operation, was disappointed that the army disobeyed his orders against looting and ransacking. The army took complete control of the area, and it seemed as though Torres Burgos had lost any type of control that he believed he had over his forces prior to this event. Shortly after, Torres Burgos called a meeting and resigned from his position. Upon leaving Jojutla with his two sons, he was surprised by a federal police patrol who subsequently shot all three of the men on the spot. This seemed to some to be an ending blow to the movement, because Torres Burgos had not selected a successor for his position; however, Zapata was ready to take up where Torres Burgos had left off.\n\nShortly after Torres Burgos' death, a party of rebels elected Zapata as \"Supreme Chief of the Revolutionary Movement of the South\" (Womack, p. 78). This seemed to be the fix to all of the problems that had just arisen, but other individuals wanted to replace Zapata as well. Due to this new conflict, the individual who would come out on top would have to do so by \"convincing his peers he deserved their backing.\"\n\nZapata finally did gain the support necessary by his peers and was considered a \"singularly qualified candidate\". This decision to make Zapata the true leader of the revolution did not occur all at once, nor did it ever reach a true definitive level of recognition. In order to succeed, Zapata needed a strong financial backing for the battles to come. This came in the form of 10,000 pesos delivered by Rodolfo from the Tacubayans. Due to this amazing sum of money Zapata's group of rebels became one of the strongest in the state financially.\n\nAfter some time Zapata became the leader of his \"strategic zone\". This gave him tremendous power and control over the actions of many more individual rebel groups and thus increased his margin of success greatly. \"Among revolutionaries in other districts of the state, however, Zapata's authority was more tenuous.\" After a meeting with Zapata and Ambrosio Figueroa in Jolalpan, it was decided that Zapata would have joint power with Figueroa with regard to operations in Morelos. This was a turning point in the level of authority and influence that Zapata had gained and proved useful in the direct overthrow of Morelos.\n\nZapata immediately began to use his newly found power and began to overthrow city after city with gaining momentum. Madero, alarmed, asked Zapata to disarm and demobilize. Zapata responded that, if the people could not win their rights now, when they were armed, they would have no chance once they were unarmed and helpless. Madero sent several generals in an attempt to deal with Zapata, but these efforts had little success. It seemed as though Zapata would shortly be able to overthrow Madero. Before he could overthrow Madero, General Victoriano Huerta beat him to it in February 1913, ordering Madero arrested and executed. This officially and formally ended the civil war.\n\nAlthough this may have caused individuals to believe that the revolution was over, it was not. The battle continued for years to come over the fact that Mexican individuals did not have agrarian rights that were fair, nor did they have the protection necessary to fight against those who pushed such exploitation upon them.\n\nIf there was anyone that Zapata hated more than Díaz and Madero, it was Victoriano Huerta, the bitter, violent alcoholic who had been responsible for many atrocities in southern Mexico while trying to end the rebellion. Zapata was not alone: in the north, Pancho Villa, who had supported Madero, immediately took to the field against Huerta. Zapata revised the Plan of Ayala and named himself the leader of his revolution. He was joined by two newcomers to the Revolution, Venustiano Carranza and Alvaro Obregón, who raised large armies in Coahuila and Sonora respectively. Together they made short work of Huerta, who resigned and fled in June 1914 after repeated military losses to the \"Big Four\".\n\nOn April 21, 1914, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson sent a contingent of troops to occupy the port city of Veracruz. This sudden threat caused Huerta to withdraw his troops from Morelos and Puebla, leaving only Jojutla and Cuernavaca under federal control. Zapatistas quickly assumed control of eastern Morelos, taking Cuautla and Jonacatepec with no resistance. In spite of being faced with a possible foreign invasion, Zapata refused to unite with Huerta in defense of the nation. He stated that if need be he would defend Mexico alone as chief of the Ayalan forces. In May the Zapatistas took Jojutla from the federales, many of whom joined the rebels, and captured guns and ammunition. They also laid siege to Cuernavaca where a small contingent of federal troops were holed up. By the summer of 1915 Zapata's forces had taken the southern edge of the Federal District, occupying Milpa Alta and Xochimilco, poised to move into the capital. Nonetheless in mid July, Huerta was forced to flee as a Constitutionalist force under Carranza, Obregón and Villa took the Federal District. The constitutionalists established a peace treaty inserting Carranza as First Authority of the nation. In spite of having contributed decisively to the fall of Huerta, the Zapatistas were left out of the peace treaties, probably because of Carranza's intense dislike for the Zapatistas whom he saw as uncultured savages. Through 1915 there was a tentative peace in Morelos and the rest of the country.\nAs the constitutionalist forces began to split, with Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa posing a popular front against Carranza's constitutionalism, Carranza worked diplomatically to get the Zapatistas to recognize his rule. He sent Dr. Atl as an envoy to propose a compromise with Zapata. Zapata nonetheless refused to recognize Carranza's leadership, stating that the only acceptable result was following the Plan de Ayala, which would make him supreme chief of an interim government.\n\nFinally, Zapata decided to side with Villa against Carranza and Obregon. Villa and the other anti-Carrancista leaders of the North established the Convention of Aguascalientes against Carranza. Zapata and his envoys managed to get the convention to adopt some of the agrarian principles of the Plan de Ayala. Zapata and Villa met in Xochimilco to negotiate an alliance and divide the responsibility for ridding Mexico of the remaining Carrancistas. The meeting was awkward but amiable, and was widely publicized. It was decided that Zapata should work on securing the area east of Morelos from Puebla towards Veracruz. Nonetheless, during the ensuing campaign in Puebla, Zapata was disappointed by Villa's lack of support. He did not initially provide the Zapatistas with the weaponry they had agreed on and, when he did, he did not provide adequate transportation. There were also a series of abuses by Villistas against Zapatista soldiers and chiefs. These experiences led Zapata to grow unsatisfied with the alliance, turning instead his efforts to reorganizing the state of Morelos that had been left in shambles by the onslaught of Huerta and Robles. Having taken Puebla, Zapata left a couple of garrisons there but did not support Villa further against Obregón and Carranza. The Carrancistas saw that the convention was divided and decided to concentrate on beating Villa, which left the Zapatistas to their own devices for a while.\n\nThrough 1915, Zapata began reshaping Morelos after the Plan de Ayala, redistributing \"hacienda\" lands to the peasants, and largely letting village councils run their own local affairs. Most peasants did not turn to cash crops, instead growing subsistence crops such as corn, beans, and vegetables. The result was that as the capital was starving, Morelos peasants had more to eat than they had had in 1910 and at lower prices. The only official event in Morelos during this entire year was a bullfight in which Zapata himself and his nephew Amador Salazar participated. 1915 was a short period of peace and prosperity for the farmers of Morelos, in between the massacres of the Huerta era and the civil war of the winners to come.\n\nEven when Villa was retreating, having lost the Battle of Celaya in 1915, and when Obregón took the capital from the Conventionists who retreated to Toluca, Zapata did not open a second front.\n\nWhen Carranza's forces were poised to move into Morelos, Zapata took action. He attacked Carrancista positions with large forces trying to harry the Carrancistas in the rear as they were occupied with routing Villa throughout the Northwest. Though Zapata managed to take many important sites such as the Necaxa power plant that supplied Mexico City, he was unable to hold them. The Convention was finally routed from Toluca, and Carranza was recognized by US President Woodrow Wilson as the head of state of Mexico in October.\n\nThrough 1916 Zapata raided federal forces from Hidalgo to Oaxaca, and Genovevo de la O fought the Carrancistas in Guerrero. The Zapatistas attempted to amass support for their cause by promulgating new manifestos against the \"hacendados\", but this had little effect since the \"hacendados\" had already lost power throughout the country.\n\nIn 1916, Carranza sent a force under General Pablo González Garza to attack Morelos from the northwest. The Zapatista generals Pachecho and Genovevo de la O who believed the former to be a traitor, struggled against each other, and Zapatista positions began to fall. First Cuernavaca, then Cuautla and then Tlaltizapán. In Tlaltizapan Gonzalez executed 289 civilians, including minors of both sexes. Throughout Morelos thousands of civilian prisoners were stuffed on boxcars and carried to Mexico City, and further to the Henequen plantations of Yucatán as forced laborers. Zapata fled into the hills as his headquarters were raided, returning after a few months later to organize guerrilla resistance throughout Morelos. The brutality of the nationalist forces further drove the Morelos peasantry towards Zapata, who mounted guerrilla warfare throughout the state and into the Federal District, blowing up trains between Cuernavaca and the capital.\nHaving been put in charge of the efforts to root out Zapatismo in Morelos, Gonzalez was humiliated by Zapata's attacks, and enforced increasingly draconian measures against the locals. He received no reinforcements, as Obregón, the Minister of War, needed all his forces against Villa in the north and against Felix Diaz in Oaxaca. Through low-scale attacks on Gonzalez's positions, Zapata had driven Gonzalez out of Morelos by the end of 1916.\nNonetheless, outside of Morelos the revolutionary forces started disbanding. Some joined the constitutionalists such as Domingo Arena, or lapsed into banditry. In Morelos, Zapata once more reorganized the Zapatista state, continuing with democratic reforms and legislation meant to keep the civil population safe from abuses by soldiers. Though his advisers urged him to mount a concerted campaign against the Carrancistas across southern Mexico, again he concentrated entirely on stabilizing Morelos and making life tolerable for the peasants. Meanwhile, Carranza mounted national elections in all state capitals except Cuernavaca, and promulgated the 1917 Constitution which incorporated elements of the Plan de Ayala.\n\nMeanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas turned over to the constitutionalists, he secured peace for his region and remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montaño moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montaño tried for treason and executed.\n\nZapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magaña as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec.\n\nZapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the United States would turn its attention to Mexico, forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico.\n\nIn December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did.\n\nZapata released statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans. In March Zapata finally sent an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gómez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement. Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magaña and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lie low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front.\n\nIn mid-March 1919, Gen. Pablo González ordered his subordinate Col. to commence operations against the Zapatistas in the mountains around Huautla. But when González later discovered Guajardo carousing in a \"cantina\", he had him arrested, and a public scandal ensued. On March 21, Zapata attempted to smuggle in a note to Guajardo, inviting him to switch sides. The note, however, never reached Guajardo but instead wound up on González's desk. González devised a plan to use this note to his advantage. He accused Guajardo of not only being a drunk, but of being a traitor. After reducing Guajardo to tears, González explained to him that he could recover from this disgrace if he feigned a defection to Zapata. So Guajardo wrote to Zapata telling him that he would bring over his men and supplies if certain guarantees were promised. Zapata answered Guajardo's letter on April 1, 1919, agreeing to all of Guajardo's terms. Zapata suggested a mutiny on April 4. Guajardo replied that his defection should wait until a new shipment of arms and ammunition arrived sometime between the 6th and the 10th. By the 7th, the plans were set: Zapata ordered Guajardo to attack the Federal garrison at Jonacatepec because the garrison included troops who had defected from Zapata. Pablo González and Guajardo notified the Jonacatepec garrison ahead of time, and a mock battle was staged on April 9. At the conclusion of the mock battle, the former Zapatistas were arrested and shot. Convinced that Guajardo was sincere, Zapata agreed to a final meeting where Guajardo would defect.\n\nOn April 10, 1919, Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries. However, when Zapata arrived at the Hacienda de San Juan, in Chinameca, Ayala municipality, Guajardo's men riddled him with bullets.\n\nAfter he was gunned down, they then took his body to Cuautla to claim the bounty, where they are reputed to have been given only half of what was promised. Zapata's body was photographed, displayed for 24 hours, and then buried in Cuautla. Pablo González wanted the body photographed, so that there would be no doubt that Zapata was dead: \"it was an actual fact that the famous \"jefe\" of the southern region had died.\" Although Mexico City newspapers had called for Zapata's body to be brought to the capital, Carranza did not do so. However, Zapata's clothing was displayed outside a newspaper's office across from the Alameda Park in the capital.\n\nAlthough for Carranza the death of Zapata was the removal of an ongoing threat, for many Zapata's assassination undermined \"worker and peasant support for Carranza and [Pablo] González.\" Obregón seized on the opportunity to attack Carranza and González, Obregón's rival candidate for the presidency, by saying \"this crime reveals a lack of ethics in some members of the government and also of political sense, since peasant votes in the upcoming election will now go to whoever runs against Pablo González.\" In spite of González's attempts to sully the name of Zapata and the Plan de Ayala during his 1920 campaign for the presidency, the people of Morelos continued to support Zapatista generals, providing them with weapons, supplies and protection. Carranza was wary of the threat of a U.S. intervention, and Zapatista generals decided to take a conciliatory approach. Bands of Zapatistas started surrendering in exchange for amnesties, and many Zapatista generals went on to become local authorities, such as Fortino Ayaquica who became municipal president of Tochimilco. Other generals such as Genovevo de la O remained active in small-scale guerrilla warfare.\n\nAs Venustiano Carranza moved to curb his former allies and now rivals in 1920 to impose a civilian, Ignacio Bonillas, as his successor in the presidency, Obregón sought to align himself with the Zapatista movement against that of Carranza. Genovevo de la O and Magaña supported him in the coup by former Constitutionalists, fighting in Morelos against Carranza and helping prompt Carranza to flee Mexico City toward Veracruz in May 1920. \"Obregón and Genovevo de la O entered Mexico City in triumph.\" Zapatistas were given important posts in the interim government of Adolfo de la Huerta and the administration of Álvaro Obregón, following his election to the presidency after the coup. Zapatistas had almost total control of the state of Morelos, where they carried out a program of agrarian reform and land redistribution based on the provisions of the Plan de Ayala and with the support of the government.\n\nAfter Zapata's assassination, according to \"La Demócrata\", Zapata \"had taken in the consciousness of the natives the proportions of a myth\" because he had \"given them a formula of vindication against old offenses.\" Mythmaking would continue for decades after Zapata was gunned down.\n\nZapata's influence continues to this day, particularly in revolutionary tendencies in southern Mexico. In the long run, he has done more for his ideals in death than he did in life. Like many charismatic idealists, Zapata became a martyr after his murder. Even though Mexico still has not implemented the sort of land reform he wanted, he is remembered as a visionary who fought for his countrymen.\n\nZapata's Plan of Ayala influenced Article 27 of the progressive 1917 Constitution of Mexico that codified an agrarian reform program. Even though the Mexican Revolution did restore some land that had been taken under Diaz, the land reform on the scale imagined by Zapata was never enacted. However, a great deal of the significant land distribution which Zapata sought would later be enacted after Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas took office in 1934. Cárdenas would fulfill not only the land distribution policies written in Article 27, but other reforms written in the Mexican Constitution as well.\n\nThere are controversies about the portrayal of Emiliano Zapata and his followers, whether they were bandits or revolutionaries. At the outbreak of the Revolution, \"Zapata's agrarian revolt was soon construed as a 'caste war' [race war], in which members of an 'inferior race' were captained by a 'modern Attila'\".\n\nZapata is now one of the most revered national heroes of Mexico. To many Mexicans, especially the peasant and indigenous citizens, Zapata was a practical revolutionary who sought the implementation of liberties and agrarian rights outlined in the Plan of Ayala. He was a realist with the goal of achieving political and economic emancipation of the peasants in southern Mexico and leading them out of severe poverty.\n\nMany popular organizations take their name from Zapata, most notably the Zapatista Army of National Liberation \"(Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional\" or EZLN in Spanish), the initially Marxist guerrilla group that emerged in the state of Chiapas in 1983 and precipitated the 1994 indigenous Zapatista uprising which still continues in Chiapas. Towns, streets, and housing developments called \"Emiliano Zapata\" are common across the country and he has, at times, been depicted on Mexican banknotes.\nModern activists in Mexico frequently make reference to Zapata in their campaigns; his image is commonly seen on banners, and many chants invoke his name: \"Si Zapata viviera con nosotros anduviera\" (\"If Zapata lived, he would walk with us\"), and \"Zapata vive, la lucha sigue\" (\"Zapata lives; the struggle continues\"). Along with this, great-great-granddaughter Antonieta Hensley shares his story and message through her poetry. \n\nHis daughter, Paulina Ana María Zapata Portillo, was aware of her father's legacy from a very early age. She continued his work of dedication to agrarian rights, serving as treasurer of the \"ejido\" of Cuautla, as \"ejidataria\" of Cuautla, as municipal councilor and municipal trustee.\n\nZapata has been depicted in movies, comics, books, music, and clothing popular with teenagers and young adults. For example, there is a \"Zapata\" (1980), stage musical written by Harry Nilsson and Perry Botkin, libretto by Allan Katz, which ran for 16 weeks at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut. A movie called \"\" (\"Zapata: A Hero's Dream\") was produced in 2004, starring Mexican actors Alejandro Fernandez, Jaime Camil, and Lucero.\n\nMarlon Brando played Emiliano Zapata in the award-winning movie based on his life, \"Viva Zapata!\" in 1952. The film co-starred Anthony Quinn, who won best supporting actor. The director was Elia Kazan and the writer was John Steinbeck.\n\nEmiliano Zapata is a major character in \"The Friends of Pancho Villa\" (1996), by \"James Carlos Blake\"\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the governor of Jakarta between 2007 and 2012 and previously served as deputy governor.\n\nHe has worked for the Jakarta administration since 1987 and was treasurer of the Golkar organization from 1993 to 1997. On 8 August 2007 he was elected governor of Jakarta (2007–2012), beating his only rival Adang Daradjatun 57.9% to 42.1% in the first ever election for the post. He was inaugurated on 7 October 2007. Having run for a second term as governor in the 2012 gubernatorial election, he was defeated on 20 September 2012 after a second-round runoff by Joko Widodo.\n\nFauzi Bowo, known as \"Foke\" to many Jakartans, was born in Jakarta to a wealthy landowning family. His father, Djohari bin Adiputro, was from Malang, East Java, and his mother, Nuraini binti Abdul Manaf, from Jakarta. After high school at Canisius College in Jakarta, Fauzi studied at the architecture faculty at the University of Indonesia from 1966 to 1967. There, he was involved in the Indonesian Students Action Front (KAMI), an organization established to counter the communist-influenced Indonesian Student Union. In 1968 he won a scholarship to study in West Germany, where he was a student of town planning at the Technical University at Brunswick, graduating in 1976. While in Germany he was active in the Indonesian Students Association. In 2000, he completed a doctoral degree \"Doktor Ingenieur\" from University of Kaiserslautern, Germany.\n\nTwo years after graduating, in 1979 Fauzi was appointed acting head of the Jakarta Regional Bureau, eventually being promoted as regional secretary in 1998. He served as treasurer to the government Golkar organization from 1983 to 1997. In 2002 he expressed his intention to stand for the governor of Jakarta, which at the time was chosen by the regional administration. However, he was persuaded to stand aside and become deputy governor to Sutiyoso.\n\nIn 2004 he began approaching political and religious organizations to support his bid for the governorship of Jakarta. With the support of 19 political parties, including Golkar, PDI-P and PPP, he stood for the governorship in 2007 with Prijanto as his running mate. Fauzi defeated his opponent Adang Daradjatun (running with Dani Anwar as candidate for deputy governor) in Jakarta's first gubernatorial election on 8 August by 57.9% to 42.1% of the vote.\n\nFauzi was shortlisted for the 2008 World Mayor award but failed to finish in the top 10.\n\nIn 2013, he was appointed as Indonesia’s ambassador to Germany.\n\nUnder Fauzi Bowo, 5 new routes of TransJakarta (Jakarta's \"busway\") were added, however TransJakarta users have complained of long waiting time and worsening service. There are constant complaints in the media about the worsening traffic situation. Many Jakartans argue that Governor Fauzi and the Jakarta regional government should have done more to invest in public transport facilities, and to enforce regulations, in order to improve traffic flows across Jakarta. One response to the problem was a plan (2011) to establish a Greater Jakarta Transportation Authority to coordinate the implementation of the numerous proposals that had been made to improve the traffic challenges. In 2012, a feasibility study for a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)system was published; it proposed integration of the TransJakarta service and a railway service, and predicted construction of the rail lines to begin at end of 2012. After the project was pushed by Fauzi's successor, Joko Widodo, construction was in fact commenced in October 2013.\n\nOne of the policies which Fauzi pursued is support for an anti-smoking campaign first introduced by his predecessor, former Governor Sutiyoso. The first tobacco legislation in Jakarta was introduced by Sutiyoso in 2005 when a by-law on air pollution control was issued. Several supporting regulations were subsequently introduced. Anti-smoking regulations introduced by Fauzi in 2011 banned people from smoking inside public buildings and certain other places. The regulations have had a noticeable impact in Jakarta. There has been a marked reduction in smoking in government offices and in places such as large modern hotels which are subject to the regulations. In May 2011 the World Health Organization named Fauzi as one of the recipients of the World No Tobacco Day 2011 Awards.\n\n\n"}

He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (Пётр Иосифович) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.\n\nJanuary 1915 he was drafted into army, but due to congenital diseases was only fit for wartime militia units and not for regular service. Early 1916 Grigory moved to Tavatui near Yekaterinburg and started working in construction site of dynamite plant (Таватуйский динамитный завод). Very soon after moving he was drawn to local Bolsheviks and met Mikhail Kabanov who helped him become a devoted follower of Lenin. By the end of 1916 he was organizing a strike at dynamite plant. In March 1917 Nikulin became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) i.e. Communist party. Party number – 128185. \n\nAs a result of financing problems with French joint-stock company, plant activists decided to stop all work with the construction of this facility early 1918. Nikulin was sent to Yekaterinburg along with all the party members of factory. He met Goloschekin, a member of the Ural Regional Committee of the RSDLP and joined Ural Cheka on his recommendation. Starting his service in Cheka Nikulin soon became acquainted with Yakov Yurovsky who noticed Nikulin's modesty, ability to get along with different people, honesty and absolute sobriety. The two became friends and formed a special relationship for years where Yurovsky simply called him \"son\". Nikulin was appointed Assistant to the Commandant of the House of Special Purpose on the recommendation of Yurovsky. The Commandant was Yurovsky himself.\n\nHaving begun work in Cheka Grigory got some serious cases to work. One of the first was discrete surveillance of Alexander Ivanovich Andogsky, the head of Military Academy of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Nikulin was introduced as a domestic worker to Andogsky after the Academy was evacuated from Petrograd to Yekaterinburg in March 1918. Later same year Andogsky joined the White forces, was dismissed from the Military Academy and eventually was appointed as General in Kolchak's Army.\n\nNikulin was also in charge of soldiers selection for train convoy L-42, on 30 April 1918 where Tsar Nicholas II and part of his family were moved from Tyumen to Yekaterinburg.\n\nExecution of Prince Vasily Alexandrovich Dolgorukov. Dolgorukov was a close friend of Nicholas II as well as his advisor, Marshal of the Imperial Court (1914–1917) and Commander of the Imperial Guard cavalry regiment. Deeply devoted to the Tsar he voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family to imprisonment in Tobolsk. After arriving to Yekaterinburg at the end of May he was separated from the family and arrested. Executed 10 July 1918 in cold blood by Nikulin, a week before the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Dolgorukov was taken to a field beyond city's Ivanovskoe Cemetery with Count Tatishchev and the two were shot in the head and thrown into a pit. Nikulin recalled the incident in his radio interview 1964: \"Я вывез его в поле и проклял всё пока тащил чемоданы назад\" (I took him out to the field and cursed everything while I was dragging his suitcases back). Dolgorukov was canonized later in 1981. \n\nNikulin was also involved in death of Hermogenes, Bishop of Tobolsk and Siberia, who was drowned in Tura River by Bolsheviks.\n\nGrigory Nikulin is known for his participating in killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Nikulin was living in the House of Special Purpose ie Ipatiev House since his appointment as Assistant to the Commandant. He was also in charge of the house in absence of Yurovsky who lived in the \"American Hotel\". The Ural Regional Soviet agreed in a meeting on June 29th that the Romanov family should be executed. After getting the final approval from Central Executive Committee in Moscow Yurovsky organized a meeting in American Hotel. Participation in killing was voluntary and people who agreed to participate came to Yurovsky's room. It was agreed that to prevent unnecessary suffering executees were to be shot to the heart. \n\nOn 17 July, right after midnight Yurovsky woke up Tsar, his family, doctor and servants, 11 persons altogether and guided them to an empty room at lower floor of the house. On demand of tsaritsa Alexandra Nikulin brought two chairs. One for her and one for Prince Alexei. Yurovsky announced the verdict: \"Nikolai Alexandrovich, in view of the fact that your relatives are continuing their attack on Soviet Russia, the Ural Executive Committee has decided to execute you.\" Shooting started. It is controversial who actually shot the Tsar – Yurovsky, Medvedev, Ermakov, or all of them. Nikulin shot one bullet to Prince Alexei and left the room. Apparently Alexei didn't die from this shot. Yurovsky shot Alexei in the head killing him. Long after this event, in private conversation with son of Mikhail Medvedev Nikulin said that he couldn't bear sick boy looking at him and stopped shooting. \n\nAfterwards Nikulin controlled carrying of corpses to truck waiting outside. He had all the jewels and valuables that had been sewn into clothes of royal family removed. On 20 July, just few days before arrival of the White Army, Nikulin left Yekaterinburg. He personally carried 6,000 carats of Tsar's diamonds to State Bank in Moscow.\n\nInteresting fact is that Nikulin was liked by Imperial family. He wasn't like others. He was well mannered and polite. From diary of Alexandra Feodorovna: \"June 21st, Thursday. \"..young assistant, who seems very nice person, compared to other ones that are vulgar and unpleasant.. Young man (Nikulin) enumerated jewelry items and did it thoroughly\". From the diary of Nicholas II: \"June 23th, Saturday. Yurovsky and his assistant (Nikulin) started to understand what sort of people was around, stealing from us and guarded us from them\". \n\nAfter completing the assignment in Yekaterinburg Nikulin joined the Red Army. He had several duties at 3rd Army of the Eastern front. He even took part in battles. Early 1919 he started working for political department of the division (politotdel) but contracted typhus and was taken to Moscow. There he met again Yurovsky, who worked for Moscow City Council at the time and offered him a job as head of the Moscow apartment houses. They continued their warm friendship meeting each other on and off duty.\n\nNikulin stayed in Moscow and worked in different jobs. First for City Council (MosSoviet). Later he was allocated to the position of Moscow prisons head. Four months after that the head of inspectorate department of Moscow police. He then worked as the head of Moscow Criminal Investigation Department from March 1920 to 1922. In 1922 he was awarded with the Order of the Red Banner.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1938 Nikulin had several noteworthy positions. 1923–1924 Vice-head of Moscow Criminal Investigation Department. From 1925 member of MosGorIspolCom (Moscow Executive Committee). 1925 - 1930 The head of MosGubStrakh (Moscow Insurance State Company). 1930–1931 the head of MosGas (Moscow Gas trest). 1933–1935 he worked at MosSovet on a problem of building materials manufacturing. 1935–1938 the head of MosZhilOtdel (Moscow Housing Department).\n\nHe was often visited by his comrades from House Ipatiev who had also taken part in Tsar's killing – Rodzinsky and Medvedev. In 1927 Nikulin and Yurovsky made an application to USSR Revolution Museum and handed them two revolvers which were used in killing of Imperial Family.\n\nYurovsky died in 1938. Before dying he wrote a warm farewell letter to his dear friend Nikulin leaving him list of documents to be delivered to Revolution Museum. From 1938 to his retirement in 1960 Nikulin worked for Department of Water and Sewerage. He was awarded with four state orders, one of which was Order of the Patriotic War 1st class (1947). During his whole life Nikulin insisted on keeping low profile concerning the killing of imperial family. He even asked Medvedev not to mention his role in killing. One year before his death he was asked by high partie official to give an interview to radio. It resulted in 3 hour recording in which he talks about everything. \"All was done consciously, without doubts. I did understand all responsibility. I welcomed the decision of Ural Regional Soviet.. And even more, if it is allowed to say, I considered it as an honor.\"\n\nGrigory Nikulin died on 22 September 1965. He was buried on the site of the \"old Bolsheviks\" at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Right across Nikulin's grave is the grave of Boris Yeltsin, President of Russian Federation. Ipatiev house was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in 1977 while being leader of Sverdlovsk Executive Committee. Politburo had declared the house not to be of \"sufficient historical significance\".\n\n"}

His usual position is open-side flanker and he currently plays for Northampton Saints in the English Premiership.\n\nHe played for the in domestic South African rugby between 2006 and 2014, for the in Super Rugby between 2007 and 2015 and also represented between 2008 and 2011 and for the South Africa Sevens team in 2006.\n\nBorn 21 July 1986 in Bloemfontein, South Africa, Heinrich Brüssow attended Grey College in Bloemfontein where he played in the First XV and was later selected for the Under-18 Free State Craven Week side. Brüssow was part of the Free State Cheetahs squad who shared the Currie Cup glory in 2006 with the Blue Bulls, before playing in the 2007 Currie Cup final against the Golden Lions, scoring a crucial try and helping the team to a 20–18 win. In 2008 he was voted best open-side flanker in the Super 14 and Currie Cup. This earned him a call-up to the Springboks squad for the November 2008 tour to the British Isles. He only played the final 4 minutes in the end-of-tour test against England.\n\nIn 2009, Brüssow was again a flanker in the Super 14 competition. However, selectors excluded him from the Springboks squad. Soon afterwards he played for the Free State Cheetahs against the British and Irish Lions team; Brüssow was finally called up for Schalk Burger, who failed to recover from an injury for the first test against the Lions. He received the Man-of-the-Match award in the Springboks' win against the All Blacks on 25 July 2009. Brüssow once again featured in a Currie Cup final in 2009, but the Free State Cheetahs lost to a hungry Blue Bulls team.\n\nEarly March 2010 Brüssow's career took a blow when he injured his cruciate knee-ligament in a Super 14 game against the Hurricanes, which kept him from international rugby till August 2011. For the Cheetahs in the 2011 super rugby season Brussow was part of the Cheetahs team that finished 11th in the table. The cheetahs won five and lost eleven games that season which showed that they were not at their best. However they produced some wonderful wins against the Waratahs and the Brumbies. In the 2011 tri nations Brüssow only came in at the third game against eventual champions Australia. South Africa lost the match 14–9. South Africa had nothing much to play for in final test against New Zealand but they could certainly spoil the party for the All Blacks. Brüssow put up a Man-of-the-Match winning performance and South Africa beat the All Blacks by 18–5.\n\nHe returned to international competition on 13 August 2011 against Australia: He played for a short stint from the bench where he showed he still had the full ability which made him so popular in 2009. On 20 August Heinrich Brüssow gave a Man-of-the-Match display of his skills as the Springboks managed to defeat their arch-enemies, the All Blacks in Port Elizabeth.\n\nBrüssow played the first game against Wales which South Africa won 17–16 and against Fiji which the boks also won 49–3. However against Namibia, Alberts was favoured to Brüssow in the starting line up which meant Brüssow had to drop to the bench. South Africa won the game and Brüssow restored his place in the starting line up against Samoa which South Africa won to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup. In the quarter-finals Brussow started against Australia. South Africa lost the game 11–9 and were knocked out of the competition. In the summer internationals Brüssow was shockingly dropped from the team with new South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer preferring Marcell Coetzee. Even without Brüssow's commitment, South Africa won the series against England with a win in the first test 22–17, second test 36–27 but where held to a draw in the third test 14–14.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that he would play for a team in the Japanese Top League for the 2013–2014 season – later revealed as NTT DoCoMo Red Hurricanes – but he would return to play for the in the 2014 Super Rugby season.\n\nIn January 2018, he joined English Premiership side Northampton Saints.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeinrich Brüssow is well known in South Africa because of his immense and unstoppable work at the breakdowns and in the scrums. He was selected for the South African team due to his excellent work performances. He was also admired by many when he outfought New Zealand captain Richie McCaw in two of their duels, one which South Africa won 18–5.\n\nIn January 2012 there was a rumour that Brüssow may join Ireland pro 12 team Ulster Rugby, but Brussow eventually stayed with the Cheetahs.\n\n"}

Being just a few weeks old he suffered a brain stroke, which came as a result of injection of calcium chloride, mistakenly made by a doctor. Brain tissue was partly damaged leading to minor autism. At the age of seven he made his first working radio. While studying at the elementary school he owned his first computer – Pravetz 8D, Bulgarian clone of British Oric Atmos with the documentation in Bulgarian language. The computer required connection to a tape recorder and a color TV set. His first computer game Kris developed for Pravetz 8D.\n\nHis next computer, Electronika BK-0010, helped Kris to master assembly. The third computer was ZX Spectrum, the fourth one was Agat. Except for his birthday, Kris does not remember exact dates and chronology of events, he reconstructs them based on computer models he had at various periods of his life.\n\nHe graduated from high school with a silver medal. Kris was a good student, and there were only excellent marks in his certificate, however, according to Kris, to get a gold medal one needed to give bribes to local officials. He entered Taganrog University of Radio Engineering with a specialization in \"Design of microcontrollers\" without entrance exam. Although he went down without taking even first end-of-semester exams because \"\"students hardly had a possibility to program\" and returned to his native village. In the next year, he entered the university again \"to calm mom\"\" and again he went down. In those years Kris had IBM PC with 20 mb disk and color monitor. In cooperation with student Shurik, they organized a service of system administration in Taganrog. Some time later his companion absconded with the money. Kris Kaspersky had to give the remaining money and the computer to racketeers and returned to the native village to his parents.\n\nThen Kris made attempts to reopen the business with a trader from Armavir, took trips to Krasnodar and Rostov. Finally, Kris ended up in the capital. \n\nThe first article written by Kris was published when he was still in school. It was published by \"Astrologer” magazine, and the article itself was devoted to astronomy. In 1998 Kris began to contribute actively to conferences of FidoNet RU.HACKER. Dmitry Sadchenko noted his posts and arranged him a meeting with the representatives of publishing house \"Solon-Press\". In 1999 \"Solon-Press\" published the first book of Kris Kaspersky \"Technique and philosophy of hacker attacks\" with 50 000 rubles of author's fee. Desktop publisher specialist Sergey Tarasov recalls:\n\nA total of 16 books had been published by 2008, including several translations into English. The books were dedicated to data protection and program optimization, computer virus and disassembling. Among these books there's also \"Weatherlore Encyclopedia\". Kris's interest lies in the field of computers and astronomy. Some of his articles and forum topics concern telescopes and observation of the starry sky. Along with the books Kris contributes to such magazines as \"System administrator\", \"Byte\", \"Astrologer\", \"Hacker\". The chief editor of \"Hacker\" magazine Nikita Kislitsin said:\n\nRecently Kris Kaspersky expressed the idea to leave Russia. And, in order to increase the audience, to start writing books originally in English. Besides Kris Kaspersky had started his English blog. In late October 2008 he made a presentation on a fundamentally new holes in Intel processors, suitable for remote capture of multiple servers at a conference Hack in the Box in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nUntil recently Kris Kaspersky lived an isolated way of life in his native village. Since June 2008, he worked remotely on Endeavor Security, engaged in security of computers and networks. In 2009, McAfee acquired Endeavor Security.\n\nSince 2008 Kris has been living and working in the United States. He worked for Check Point as a security expert.\n\nIn order to avoid any confusion with antivirus creator Eugene Kaspersky, he spells his penname differently in Russian. His penname \"myschh\" was chosen owing to the novel \"Dune\" which is a great favorite of his (Kris often used quotations from the novel, in particular, in his first book \"Technique and philosophy of hacker attacks\"). The name of the protagonist of the novel is Muad'Dib, which stands for a desert mouse. Kris Kaspersky penname is not a derivative from any other word and it has no relevance to Eugene Kaspersky. Kris named himself after Casper the friendly ghost from his favorite cartoon and Kris Kelmi, whose music, nevertheless, myschh never listened to.\nKris was very lean. He spoke with a southern accent, sometimes swallowed and distorted words, softened endings of the verbs. He wore long hair and beard. He was not fussed about clothing. \nKaspersky described his native village this way: \"Dedicated ten megabits internet channel\".\n\nOn February 10, 2017, Kris Kaspersky (Nikolay Likhachev) was critically injured in a hard landing after sky diving: \"A sky diver who took a hard landing at Skydive DeLand remains in intensive care and is unable to communicate, a nurse at Halifax Health Medical Center said Monday. The sky diver, 40-year-old Nikolay Likhachev, suffered a compound fracture to his left leg and a head injury, an incident report released Monday by DeLand police states. The report states that Likhachev had completed 200 jumps, most of them at Skydive DeLand. Likhachev […] was injured Friday just before 9:15 a.m.\"\n\nKris Kaspersky was taken off life support and died from his wounds a week later on February 18, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lamoni's father was king over all of the Lamanites, a people who traditionally had a visceral hatred of the Nephites. After initially having the Nephite missionary Ammon imprisoned, Lamoni later allows him to be his servant. Later still Ammon saves some of Lamoni's servants and animals in a seemingly miraculous way. Lamoni then believes that Ammon is the Great Spirit. After being told by Ammon that he (Ammon) is only a servant of the Great Spirit (meant by context to mean \"God\") Lamoni is finally convinced that Ammon is not deity. After his conversion Lamoni is traveling with Ammon when he encounters his father the high Lamanite king. At the peril of his life Lamoni verbally defends Ammon. Eventually Lamoni helps gain freedom for Ammon and his fellow Nephite missionaries to preach freely in the Lamanite areas.

{"id": "101393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101393", "title": "Liev Schreiber", "text": "Liev Schreiber\n\nIsaac Liev Schreiber (; born October 4, 1967) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer. He became known during the late 1990s and early 2000s, having appeared in several independent films, and later mainstream Hollywood films, including the \"Scream\" trilogy of horror films, \"Ransom\" (1996), \"Phantoms\" (1998), \"The Sum of All Fears\" (2002), \"The Omen\" (2006), \"\" (2009), \"Taking Woodstock\" (2009), \"Salt\" (2010), \"Goon\" (2011), \"Pawn Sacrifice\" (2014), and \"Spotlight\" (2015).\n\nSchreiber is also a stage actor, having performed in several Broadway productions. In 2005, he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in the play \"Glengarry Glen Ross\". That year, he made his debut as a film director and writer with \"Everything Is Illuminated\" (2005), based on the novel of the same name. Schreiber has had further success in the television world, notably portraying the eponymous protagonist of the Showtime drama series \"Ray Donovan\" (2013–present); the role has earned him five Golden Globe Award nominations and three Primetime Emmy Award nominations. He also narrates the HBO series \"24/7\", as well as various PBS programs.\n\nSchreiber was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Heather (\"née\" Milgram) and Tell Carroll Schreiber, a stage actor and director. His father comes from a wealthy Protestant family, and his mother is Jewish. His maternal grandfather was a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant.\n\nWith a firm knowledge of classical music and Russian literature, Schreiber's mother has been described by Schreiber as a \"far-out Socialist Labor Party hippie bohemian freak who hung out with William Burroughs.\" When Heather was 12, her mother (Schreiber's grandmother) was lobotomized.\n\nHis mother has said that she named him after her favorite Russian author, Leo Tolstoy, while his father has stated that Schreiber was named after the doctor who saved his mother's life. His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is \"Huggy.\"\n\nWhen Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to Canada, winding up in the unincorporated rural community of Winlaw, in the southern interior of British Columbia. (Ten years later, following the events explained below, Schreiber's half-brother, actor Pablo Schreiber, was born in Winlaw.) Prior to this time, according to Schreiber's father, at the beginning of their marriage (in San Francisco), Schreiber's mother had a bad experience on LSD. Over the next four years, she was repeatedly admitted to hospitals and underwent therapy.\n\nAfter Schreiber's father threatened to admit her to a mental institution, she left with her son. With his father in pursuit, Schreiber and his mother were trailed by private detectives in various states; when he was three, his father kidnapped him from an upstate New York commune where Heather had gone to escape detection. By the time Schreiber was four, he was living with her on the fourth floor of a dilapidated walkup at First Avenue and First Street in New York City (his half brothers from her first marriage were with their father in a duplex on Central Park West), and he was the object of a fierce custody battle, which bankrupted his maternal grandfather, Alex Milgram. Milgram, who was the most significant male in Schreiber's youth, played the cello and owned Renoir etchings, and made his living by delivering meat to restaurants.\n\nWhen Schreiber was five, his parents divorced; his mother won custody, and the two moved to a cold-water flat on the Lower East Side in Manhattan, where he was raised and first began his career in theater by enrolling in Joffrey Ballet School of NY. Growing up, they frequently had no electricity, hot water, or even beds.\n\nHis mother was \"a highly cultured eccentric\" who supported them by splitting her time between driving a cab and creating \"papier-mâché\" puppets.\" On Schreiber's 16th birthday, his mother bought him a motorcycle \"to promote fearlessness.\" The critic John Lahr wrote in a 1999 \"New Yorker\" profile that, \"To a large extent, Schreiber's professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother's eccentricities. It's both his grief and his gift.\" He endured her mood swings and bohemian proclivities, which included making him take Hindu names, wear yoga shirts, and forcing , briefly, to go to an ashram school in Connecticut when he was 12. In high school, played the bass clarinet. Schreiber's mother also forbade Schreiber from seeing color movies. As a result, his favorite actors were Charlie Chaplin, Andrew Cartwright and Basil Rathbone.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Schreiber, known then as Shiva Das, lived at the Satchidananda Ashram, Yogaville East, in Pomfret, Connecticut. He abided by his mother's vegetarian diet. In retrospect, Schreiber said in a 2008 interview that he appreciates his mother's influences, saying: \"Since I've had Sasha, I've completely identified with everything my mother went through raising me... and I think her choices were inspired.\"\n\nSubsequently, Schreiber attended Friends Seminary at the same time as future actress Amanda Peet.\n\nSchreiber went on to Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he began his acting training at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, via the Five Colleges consortium. In March 1989, played Antonio in \"The Merchant of Venice\" alongside Jeffrey Donovan. graduated with a master's degree from the Yale School of Drama in 1992, where he starred in Charles Evered's \"The Size of the World,\" directed by Walton Jones. At Yale, studied with Earle R. Gister. He also attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. He originally wanted to be a screenwriter, but was steered toward acting.\n\nSchreiber had several supporting roles in various independent films until his big break, as the accused murderer Cotton Weary in the \"Scream\" trilogy of horror films. Though the success of the \"Scream\" trilogy led Schreiber to roles in several big-budget studio pictures, \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote in 2007 that \"Schreiber is [still] best known for such indie gems as \"Walking and Talking,\" \"The Daytrippers,\" and \"Big Night\".\"\n\nAfter \"Scream,\" Schreiber was cast as the young Orson Welles in the HBO original movie \"RKO 281,\" for which he was nominated for Emmy and Golden Globe awards. He then played supporting roles in several studio films, including Ron Howard's 1996 remake of \"Ransom\", \"The Hurricane\", \"A Walk on the Moon\" (1999); the 2000 movie version of \"Hamlet\", and, as Tom Clancy's fictional C.I.A. super spy and assassin John Clark, in \"The Sum of All Fears\".\n\nThe 2004 remake of \"The Manchurian Candidate\", with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, was another major film for Schreiber, stirring some controversy as it opened during a heated presidential election cycle. Schreiber also played Robert Thorn with Julia Stiles in the 2006 film \"The Omen\", a remake of the 1976 horror classic \"The Omen\". He played the time-traveling ex-boyfriend of Meg Ryan in \"Kate and Leopold\", also starring Hugh Jackman.\n\nAlong with his screen work, Schreiber is a well-respected classical actor; in a 1998 review of the Shakespeare play \"Cymbeline,\" \"The New York Times\" called his performance \"revelatory\" and ended the article with the plea, \"More Shakespeare, Mr. Schreiber.\"\nA year later, Schreiber played the title role in \"Hamlet\" in a December 1999 revival at The Public Theater, to similar raves. In 2000, he went on to play Laertes in the film \"Hamlet\", a modern adaptation of the play.\n\nHis performance in the title role of \"Henry V\" in a 2003 Central Park production of that play caused \"The New Yorker\" magazine critic John Lahr to expound upon his aptitude at playing Shakespeare. \"He has a swiftness of mind,\" Lahr wrote, \"which convinces the audience that language is being coined in the moment. His speech, unlike that of the merely adequate supporting cast, feels lived rather than learned.\"\n\nFrom June to July 2006, he played the title role in \"Macbeth\" opposite Jennifer Ehle at the Delacorte Theater.\n\nSchreiber has narrated a number of documentaries, many of them aired as part of PBS series such as \"American Experience\", \"Nova,\" and \"Secrets of the Dead\" from 2001-11. He is the voice behind the television commercials for Infiniti. In 1995, he provided narration for the BBC/WGBH documentary co-production \"Rock & Roll\". In 1994, he narrated \"Two Billion Hearts\", the official film of 1994 World Cup.\n\nSchreiber is also the voice of HBO's \"Sports of the 20th Century\" documentaries. Similarly, Schreiber is the narrator of HBO Boxing's \"Countdown\" and \"24/7\" documentary series. Schreiber served as the voice of Skeletor in the 2002 incarnation of \"Masters of the Universe\". He narrated \"Magic & Bird: A Courtship of Rivals\" and \"Broad Street Bullies\" in 2010, on HBO, and provided the narration for \"Making of Pumping Iron\" documentary that is included in a special anniversary edition of the movie \"Pumping Iron\". He also narrated the History Channel specials \"Ape to Man\", \"The Lost Kennedy Home Movies\", and \"\".\n\nSchreiber reprised his role as narrator for HBO's \"24/7: Road to the Winter Classic\" NHL documentary, which followed the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals as they prepared to face each other in the 2011 NHL Winter Classic at Heinz Field, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 1, 2011. Once again, Schreiber was the narrator for the HBO series, \"24/7 : Road to the Winter Classic\". That year, the Philadelphia Flyers and the New York Rangers battled in the Classic, at Citizens Bank Park in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic. Once more, Schreiber narrated for the HBO series in 2014 for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic, which showcased the Toronto Maple Leafs against the Detroit Red Wings at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nSchreiber has been the narrator in HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" for every season, except for the 2007 season with the Kansas City Chiefs. He also narrated the 2011 documentary \"Hitler's G.I. Death Camp\" on the National Geographic Channel. The newly released 2012 \"Kinderblock 66\" is narrated by Schreiber, as was the 2013 documentary \"Money for Nothing\". He provided the voiceover for the 2018 Kia Stinger GT commercial.\n\nSchreiber told \"The New Yorker\" in 1999, \"I don't know that I want to be an actor for the rest of my life.\" For a time in the late '90s, he hoped to produce and direct an adaptation of \"The Merchant of Venice\" starring Dustin Hoffman.\n\nDuring that time, Schreiber started writing a screenplay about his relationship with his Ukrainian grandfather, a project he abandoned when, according to \"The New York Times,\" \"he read Jonathan Safran Foer's hit novel, \"Everything Is Illuminated,\" and decided Mr. Foer had done it better.\" Schreiber's film adaptation of the short story from which the novel originated, which he both wrote and directed, was released in 2005. The film, which starred Elijah Wood, received lukewarm-to-positive reviews, with Roger Ebert calling it \"a film that grows in reflection.\"\n\nIn 2002, he starred in Neil LaBute's play \"The Mercy Seat\" along with Sigourney Weaver off-Broadway that was critically and commercially very successful. In the spring of 2005, Schreiber played the role of Richard Roma in the Broadway revival of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Glengarry Glen Ross\". As Roma, Schreiber won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play. In 2006, Schreiber was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn the fall of that year, he directed and starred in the \"2006 Join the Fight\" AIDS PSA campaign for Cable Positive and Kismet Films (others involved with the campaign included actress Naomi Watts, fashion designer Calvin Klein, and playwright Tony Kushner).\n\nSchreiber played Charlie Townsend in the 2006 film \"The Painted Veil,\" starring opposite Watts and Edward Norton. In the same year, Schreiber also appeared in \"The Omen\", which was a remake of the 1976 film of the same name. For television, the actor portrayed a character who temporarily replaces Gil Grissom, played by William Petersen on \"\" (2006–07 season) as Michael Keppler, a seasoned CSI with a strong reputation in various police departments across the nation, before joining the veteran Las Vegas team.\n\nSchreiber joined the cast on January 18, 2007, and shot a four-episode arc. He appeared in the Broadway revival of Eric Bogosian's \"Talk Radio\". The show began previews at the Longacre Theatre on February 15, 2007, in preparation for its March opening. On May 11, 2007, he won the Drama League Award for distinguished performance for his portrayal of shock jock \"Barry Champlain\" in \"Talk Radio,\" and has received Tony, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations for the role. \"The New York Times\"' Ben Brantley called his performance \"the most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting.\" Schreiber played the womanizing Lotario Thurgot in Mike Newell's screen adaptation of \"Love in the Time of Cholera,\" released in 2007. In a January 2007 interview, Schreiber mentioned that he was working on a screenplay.\n\nLate in 2008, Schreiber portrayed Jewish resistance fighter, Zus Bielski, in the film \"Defiance\", alongside Daniel Craig. That same year, 20th Century Fox announced Schreiber would play the mutant supervillain, Victor Creed/Sabretooth in the Marvel Comics film \",\" released on May 1, 2009. This was the second film he has done with Hugh Jackman. In March 2010, it was announced that he was interested in returning for \"Scream 4\", portraying Cotton Weary a fourth time (the film was subsequently made without his involvement).\n\nIn 2010, he returned to Broadway in \"A View from the Bridge\" for which he received a Tony nomination for Best Leading Actor in a Play. Schreiber narrates \"Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle\", a three-hour documentary that premiered on PBS in October 2013.\n\nIn 2015, he joined \"\".\n\nHe co-starred alongside Janet McTeer in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" on Broadway, with Schreiber cast as the Machiavellian seducer Vicomte de Valmont. The play runs from October 2016 to January 2017.\n\nDuring the story development for \"Logan\", Liev had been approached about the potential of Victor Creed/Sabretooth to return to the \"X-Men\" film universe. Following the film's release Hugh Jackman revealed that early versions of the script included the character, but that element was eventually removed from the final screenplay.\n\nIn 2017, Liev was cast to voice the Storm King, the main antagonist in the 2017 film \"\", based on the show \"\". On his acceptance of the part, Liev said that, because of his kids' exposure to his adult-oriented movie work, he wanted something more child-friendly for them to watch.\nHe was part of the ensemble cast of the 2018 animated film \"Isle of Dogs\", by Wes Anderson, which premiered at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival. He is also set to star as Kingpin in the animated Spiderman movie \"\".\n\nRumors regarding his relationship with British-Australian actress Naomi Watts (with whom he appeared in \"The Painted Veil\") have questioned whether the couple are married. In January 2010, Watts was quoted saying that Schreiber had given her a ring (which she was not wearing at the time), but that neither of them wanted to rush into marriage. At Tropfest on June 22, 2013, Schreiber referred to Watts as his wife.\n\nThe couple's first son, Alexander Pete, was born in 2007. They call him Sasha, a Russian nickname variation of the name Alexander. In 2008, Watts gave birth to the couple's second son, Samuel Kai. In April 2010, Watts said that the pair would have a third child if they could be guaranteed a baby girl or twin baby girls.\n\nOn September 26, 2016, Schreiber and Watts announced their separation, after 11 years together.\n\nSchreiber endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n"}
{"id": "22899669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22899669", "title": "Lionel Brough", "text": "Lionel Brough\n\nLionel Brough (10 March 1836 – 9 November 1909) was a British actor and comedian. After beginning a journalistic career and performing as an amateur, he became a professional actor, performing mostly in Liverpool during the mid-1860s. He established his career in London as a member of the company at the new Queen's Theatre, Long Acre in 1867, and he soon became known for his roles in Shakespeare, contemporary comedies, and classics, especially as Tony Lumpkin in \"She Stoops to Conquer\".\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, Brough was one of the leading comic actors in London. Although untrained musically, he also appeared in several successful operettas in the 1880s and 1890s. He continued to contribute popular performances into the 20th century and ended his career in comedy roles with Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company.\n\nBrough was born in Pontypool, Wales, the son of Barnabas Brough, a brewer, publican, wine merchant and later dramatist, and his wife Frances Whiteside, a poet and novelist. His brothers, William and Robert (father of actress Fanny Brough) were also playwrights, and his brother John Cargill Brough was a science writer. His father was briefly kidnapped by the Chartists in 1839 and was a prosecution witness at the trial of the Chartist leader John Frost, which resulted in Frost's deportation to Australia. The family was ostracised and ruined financially as a result, and they moved to Manchester in 1843. Brough's first job was as an office boy at \"The Illustrated London News\". He was then employed as assistant publisher by \"The Daily Telegraph\" and for several years at \"The Morning Star\". At the former, he introduced to England the American system of selling the newspaper in the streets using newsboys.\n\nBrough made his stage debut at age 18 with the company of Madame Vestris to play in an extravaganza written by his brother William. In 1858, he was again at the Lyceum but then left the professional stage to work at \"The Morning Star\". He performed in amateur theatricals in the early 1860s. As an amateur he appeared before Queen Victoria at the Lyceum Theatre in 1860 with the Savage Club, in a burlesque of the Ali Baba story called \"The Forty Thieves\", and was judged by the critic of \"The Times\" to have played like a practised professional. This burlesque was presented as a fund-raiser for the Lancashire Famine Relief Fund.\n\nBrough repeated \"The Forty Thieves\" in Liverpool, where Alexander Henderson, manager of the Prince of Wales Theatre in that city, was impressed enough to engage Brough for his company. In his \"Who's Who\" entry, Brough recorded: \"joined theatrical profession (permanently) at Prince of Wales's, Liverpool, 1863.\" The company there included Squire Bancroft and John Hare. In 1864, he performed there as Iago in \"Ernani\" opposite Lydia Thompson and Lavinia in \"The Miller and His Men\". He also performed at other Liverpool theatres in the 1860s, including the Amphitheatre and the Alexandra, at the last of which he performed with Edward Saker, with whom he also toured.\nBrough made his London debut in 1865 in \"Prince Pretty Pet\" by his brother William at the Lyceum Theatre but continued mostly in Liverpool until 1867. In 1867, he joined the London company that opened the new Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, with Charles Wyndham, Henry Irving, J. L. Toole, Ellen Terry and Henrietta Hodson, in a production of Charles Reade's \"The Double Marriage\". \"The Times\" wrote of him, \"Mr Lionel Brough, an accession from the Liverpool stage, in the small part of Dard, showed the right and rare quality of humour without gag or grimace... His appearance in other characters will be looked for with interest.\" In \"The Taming of the Shrew\", he was cast as Grumio. He then played the serious role of uncle Ben Garner in \"Dearer Than Life\", by H. J. Byron together with Toole, Irving and Harriet Everard, in which he was praised for his \"very great power\", and in which role he frequently toured. This was followed by \"La Vivandière\", W. S. Gilbert's parody of \"La fille du régiment\", in which the same critic said that Brough \"appears to understand thoroughly and remarkably for so young an actor the true principles of burlesque acting.\" The same company presented many adaptations of the novels of Charles Dickens, including \"Oliver Twist\" in 1868, with Brough as Bumble the beadle. The following year, at the St James's Theatre's revival of \"She Stoops to Conquer\", Brough played Tony Lumpkin for almost 200 nights. Thenceforth, in the words of the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", \"he was the accepted representative of the character, which he played in all 777 times.\" In addition to Tony Lumpkin and Ben Garner, according to Frederick Waddy, Brough's best-known early roles were Spotty in \"The Lancashire Lass\", Sampson Burr in \"The Porter's Knot\", Mark Meddle in \"London Assurance\" and Robin Wildbriar in \"Extremes\". In 1873, Waddy wrote of Brough, \"to his great natural humour and fun he adds a conscientious and careful study of the characters he undertakes... He plays them with marked intelligence and appreciation, and a display of genuine humorous power and versatility not too frequently met with on the stage\".\nIn 1870, Brough was the title character in \"Paul Pry\" at the St. James's Theatre. In 1871, with Mrs. John Wood, he performed in \"Milky White\" and \"Poll and Partner Joe\". In 1872, he acted as stage manager for Dion Boucicault at the Covent Garden. Though not trained as a singer, Brough was recruited in 1872 to join Joseph Fell's company at the Holborn Theatre in leading roles in popular musical works including F. C. Burnand's English version of \"La Vie parisienne\". In August of the same year he appeared at Covent Garden in Dion Boucicault's fairy drama \"Babil and Bijou\". During the 1870s, Brough was resident comic lead at the Gaiety, Globe, Charing Cross and Imperial theatres. In the 1870s and 1880s he increasingly augmented his popular parts in modern works with more revivals of classic comic roles, including Tony Lumpkin again, Croaker in Oliver Goldsmith's \"The Good-Natured Man\", Dromio of Ephesus in \"The Comedy of Errors\" and Bob Acres in \"The Rivals\". In 1878, he played opposite Lydia Thompson in burlesques at the Folly Theatre, including as King Jingo in \"Stars and Garters\". He appeared as Valentine in \"Mefistofele\" (1880) with Lizzie St Quentin in the title role, Fred Leslie as Faust and Constance Loseby as Marguerite.\n\nOne of Brough's popular characters was Constable Robert Roberts, \"Policeman X24\", an early example of the archetypical British bobby, which he presented at concerts and benefit performances. The character was a vehicle for Brough to entertain an audience with banter and comic songs. In contrast, Brough also played a serious role as a policeman in an 1884 one-act play, \"Off Duty\", as Sergeant Ben Bloss, in which, \"The Morning Post\" said, \"Mr Lionel Brough has a pathetic part, which he plays with earnestness and feeling.\" Brough originated the role of Nick Vedder in the hit operetta \"Rip Van Winkle\", in 1882, and played in another operetta, \"Nell Gwynne\", in 1884. In 1885, he toured the United States with Violet Cameron. In 1888, he appeared in T. Edgar Pemberton's comedy, \"Steeple Jack\". Brough played the comic lead, Pietro, in Gilbert and Alfred Cellier's comic opera \"The Mountebanks\" (1892).\n\nIn the final phase of his career Brough was a regular member of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company at Her Majesty's Theatre from 1894 until his death, becoming famous for his comedy roles in Shakespeare, including Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\", Touchstone in \"As You Like It\", Trinculo in \"The Tempest\", and the gardener in \"Richard II\". His last appearances were in 1909 as the grave-digger in \"Hamlet\" (described by \"The Observer\" as \"ideal\"), Moses in \"The School for Scandal\", and the host of the Garter Inn in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nBrough encouraged all his children to become actors. His elder daughter Mary Brough (\"Polly\") had a long and successful career. His elder son \"'Bobbie\" (Sydney Brough, 1868–1911) was a popular leading man when he died of complications following a throat infection; he was married to Lizzie Webster, a granddaughter of Benjamin Nottingham Webster. Lionel Brough's younger daughter \"Daisy\" (Margaret Brough, 1870–1901) died of peritonitis, and his younger son Percy Brough (1872–1904) toured with the Brough-Boucicault Comedy Company in Australia and New Zealand but died en route from England to China.\n\nBrough died at his home, Percy Villa, in South Lambeth at the age of 73 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. \"The Manchester Guardian\" said of him in its obituary, \"His power of holding his audience and obtaining his effects by the simplest means, and with an expert knowledge of their value, made his work delightful. ... In private life, Mr Brough was universally popular with a fund of anecdote which often kept the members of the Eccentric and other clubs in roars of laughter till the early hours of the morning.\"\n\n"}

The following night, Susannah and Zoran entered the house along with an extra housemate, Billy who is added to put Hayley and Andrew's secret relationship challenge into jeopardy. On Day 11, Demet entered the house after being voted in by the existing housemates. Nick entered the house on Day 18 as the winner of the Starburst Golden Key promotion. A further two female housemates, Daniela and Laura, later entered as \"Intruders\" on Day 31. Two further Intruders Michelle and Zach, entered on Day 50.

Aleisha celebrated her 21st birthday in the house on 22 May 2007, and requested a \"country\" theme. She is the longest sustaining original housemate of the season yet to be nominated until Big Brother nominated her after the housemates failed the Police Academy weekly task in Week 9.

He currently holds the title of the best ever housemate in the Friday Night Games, with three victories to his credit, and also runner-up once. Andrew claimed in Week 9 that his Big Brother contract only lasted until early July, while all other housemates' contracts last until mid-August, since Andrew could only take leave from his job for two months, and that if he is not evicted he would be willing to walk out. He is the eleventh housemate to be evicted, on Day 64, by public voting with 24% of the merged vote, along with Thomas in a double eviction. After Big Brother 2007, Hayley and Andrew have ended their relationship.\n\nKris William \"Billy\" Bentley (born 1983) (also known in publicity as Mr. X prior to entering the house) is a former boyfriend of housemate Hayley. He is brought into the house to stir up the hidden relationship of Andrew and Hayley. Billy states his occupation as being an insurance broker. He was travelling in Canada when approached by Big Brother producers to enter the house. Billy was not originally a legitimate housemate however was granted this position on Day 16 for the success of his task in challenging Andrew and Hayley's secret couple task. On Day 99, Billy was evicted with 14% of the merged vote, finishing in fourth place. In 2015, Bentley began co-hosting Channel 11's Couch Time.\n\nBodie Czeladka (born 1983) was an electrical designer from Western Australia and is of Polish-Croatian heritage. He is an underwear model and describes himself as grateful, abundant woman wants and is a ladies' man. He described himself as an \"undiagnosed ADHD sufferer\". In an unprecedented step, he is designated by Big Brother as a \"non-housemate\" because he broke rules about discussing nominations. He is not permitted to make contact with the rest of the housemates and is to be separated from them at all times. He is reinstated by Big Brother as a \"housemate\" before the end of Day 10. He is the third housemate to be evicted on Day 22 by public voting with 7% of the merged vote, along with on-again off-again girlfriend TJ, in a double eviction.

Emma is a former Adelaide-based model and was winner of the South Australian section of the Ralph Swimsuit Model of the Year competition in 2005. Emma underwent breast enlargement surgery more than six months before entering the Big Brother House to enhance her modelling career. She was the subject of a nude pictorial for Zoo Weekly, photographed before she entered the Big Brother House, in the 14 May edition. Emma has an English-born partner Tim Stanton, also a personal trainer, and they had lived together in Sydney prior to Emma entering the Big Brother House.\n\nEmma's father died on 16 May 2007 whilst Emma was still in the Big Brother House and she was not advised of his death. Emma and her father had been estranged for six years although they had recently been communicating through text messages. Her father's dying wish was that Emma not be informed of his death until after she had left the Big Brother house. He had hoped that his death would not receive publicity, however news of his passing was leaked to the news media. Emma's brother Matt reported that their father had endured a long illness and the family had had some time to prepare themselves. In an open letter to the Australian public, which was posted on the official Big Brother website, Matt Cornell explained that he and Emma had \"discussed the possibility of dad’s death thoroughly. I can confirm with absolute confidence that Emma has prepared herself and her views have been considered in the family’s decision-making process.\" This news has been reported internationally. The producers of the series confirmed that, on her eviction from the house, Emma would be advised of her father's death in private and away from television cameras.\n\nOn 28 May \"Big Brother\" producer Kris Noble wrote to the press saying that \"we were not aware that Emma's father had died until it was disclosed to the press by persons unknown. This took place after the funeral service. This in turn led to media speculation that the producers of \"Big Brother\" chose not to tell Emma about her father's death and would somehow use the tragedy as a grab for ratings, causing further distress for the family who wanted to keep their sad news private.\" On the evening of 28 May, during the staging of the live \"Nominations\" show two audience members held up a sign reading \"Emma, Your Dad Is Dead\", presumably hoping a housemate would see it during a live cross between host Gretel Killeen and the housemates during the program. However, the \"Nomination\" show features no live crosses; these are in fact a feature of \"Eviction\" shows. They were discovered and ejected from the audience.\n\nEmma is the eighth housemate to be evicted, on Day 50, by public voting with 76% of the merged vote, along with Rebecca in a double eviction. Emma had been informed of her father's death during a meeting with her brother Matt and a psychologist, 24 hours prior to her eviction. The issue of her father's death was only briefly mentioned when Emma appeared on the stage during the eviction show. Emma stated that \"I want to leave it alone tonight as was my father's wish.\" After two weeks of doing public appearances for Big Brother she cancelled all future appearances. Journalist Amy Harris opined that, with the knowledge that her father was gravely ill at the time, Cornell \"should not have been included in this series. Period.\" Harris reported that Cornell later refused to discuss the matter with the free press, but later sold the story to a \"tabloid magazine\".\n\nHayley Luscott (born 22 February 1983) is a law graduate from Victoria and was a body sculpture champion. She describes herself as intelligent, fun and compassionate. She was in a relationship with housemate Andrew which was being kept secret from the other housemates as a week one challenge set by Big Brother. In week five Big Brother decided that it was time to remove a member of the couple, and Andrew and Hayley were required by Big Brother to decide between them which of them should leave. She chose to leave and so was evicted by Big Brother on Day 31, becoming the fifth evictee. After Big Brother 2007, Hayley and Andrew have ended their relationship. Hayley blamed Big Brother for their breakup.\n\nJamie McDonald (born 27 March 1978) was a karaoke host and self-proclaimed nerd originally from Ballarat, Victoria.

The revelation came after the house mates were assigned a task involving the care of artificial babies. The task was cancelled due to Kate's evidently traumatic reaction to it where she asked to leave the house. As a result of this Big Brother cancelled the task, and Kate chose to stay. The producers knew about the death of Kate's baby. In a press release, Producer Kris Noble stated the producers had discussed it with Kate before she entered the competition, and she had said she was over it. However, he later admitted that it had nevertheless been a misjudgment to assign such a task and that, despite her claims, they should have been more sensitive.

She entered the house on Day 50 as an Intruder, alongside Zach during the Double Eviction / Double Intruder special.

The odds given for her eviction on 8 July (Day 78) were the lowest ever for any reality television event worldwide, being placed at A$1.01. She is the fourteenth housemate to be evicted, on Day 78, by public voting with 73% of the merged vote, and a series record of 92% of the total evict vote which she received the name of the most percentage of votes ever recorded.

He is the twelfth housemate to be evicted, on Day 64, by public voting with 22% of the merged vote, along with Andrew in a double eviction.\n\nTheresa Jane \"TJ\" Whitlock (born 1 July 1985) was a bar attendant from Darwin, Northern Territory. She describes herself as \"unique, bizarre, and complex\". TJ had a tempestuous relationship with fellow housemate Bodie while in the house. She is the second housemate to be evicted, on Day 22, by public voting with 54% of the merged vote, along with on-again off-again boyfriend Bodie, in a double eviction. TJ had a friendly personality, but with a fiery temper, particularly towards Bodie and Thomas.\n\nTravis Perkins (born 1975) is a truck driver from Pakenham, Victoria, who works for Safeway. He describes himself as straight-up, honest and caring. He was a child model and is currently married with a son named Jesse, who was born with a rare condition in which he cannot grow teeth. Travis missed Jesse's third birthday on Day 84. Travis was chosen for the 2004 Big Brother house but chose not to enter as his wife was pregnant at the time. He had long been considered a favourite to win this series of Big Brother, however, two weeks before the finale, there was a lot of backlash with speculation as to whether his \"ocker\" character was genuine. On Day 99, Travis was evicted with 18% of the merged save votes, finishing in third place.\n\nZach Douglas (age 24) is a corsetiere from Echuca, Victoria. He entered the house on Day 50 as an Intruder alongside Michelle during the Double Eviction / Double Intruder special. He is openly gay and describes himself as compassionate, loveable and one-in-a-million. As a corsetiere he works for his own label, Zach Douglas Designs. He was the first Intruder to make the final two in Big Brother Australia. He was announced runner-up to Aleisha with 49% of the vote, making it the closest Big Brother Australian finale ever. His achievement as runner-up has been supported by the gay community.\n\nZoran Vidinovski (born 1984) is a club coordinator from Queensland and is of Macedonian heritage. He says that the best feature about his body is his eyes. He is one of the two housemates voted into the house by public SMS vote. He lost 15 kilograms prior to entering the house. He is the eighteenth housemate to be evicted, on Day 92, with 1% of the merged vote, along with Joel in a double eviction.\n\nTravers \"Cruz\" Chue (born 1984) is a fashion designer from Queensland. He was the first wildcard to press the red button and leave the White Room on Day 8, after being tempted by Big Brother to leave for A$750. Gretel Killeen later hinted that the money would have greatly increased if he had delayed.\n\nHarrison Rhoades is a carpenter and scuba diving instructor from Sydney. He was the third housemate to be eliminated from the White Room through voting by the current housemates.\n\nKara Otter is a retail assistant from New South Wales. She was the second person to be eliminated from the White Room, by nomination from Demet and Harrison.\n\nKyle Sandilands, former Celebrity Big Brother Australia contestant and radio host, entered the house on Day 84 and was supposed to stay as an \"intruder\" until Day 87, but left the house after only a day due to a severe migraine. He was set a secret task by Big Brother during a special show before the Live Eviction 12 show on Day 83, to challenge the housemates to speak up and stop flying under the radar. He was supposed to broadcast his radio show, \"The Kyle and Jackie O Show\", from the house on Day 87. During his short stay in the house he had a short showdown with Big Brother after being asked to remove his hat whilst in the Diary Room. Big Brother refused to speak to him until he did, causing Kyle to swear at Big Brother and eventually force his way out of the room using a microphone stand. His stated reason for leaving was having a severe migraine. It has been speculated that his real reasons for leaving were that he was not given the star treatment he had expected, and that Big Brother had lied to him.\n"}

Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed.\n\nThe historical concept and definition of sexual orientation varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word \"gay\" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term \"sexual orientation\" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies. However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s). Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or identity. See homosexuality and bisexuality for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people.\n\nThe high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that \"[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are divided – a thin majority (51 percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42 percent disagree.\"\n"}

During the initial infection, people often have mild or no symptoms, and there is typically no symptoms early during chronic infection. This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.\n\nAlthough HCV was not discovered until April 1989, an estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected by hepatitis C. As of April 2014, 130—150 million globally suffer from chronic hepatitis C infection; a significant number develop cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. Each year, 350,000 to 500,000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases. No vaccine is available at this time. The symptoms of infection can be medically managed when the disease is diagnosed early, and a proportion of patients can be cleared of the virus by a course of anti-viral medicines. Globally, an estimated 50–95% of people treated are cured. With more recently developed medications cure rates are around 80 to 95%. The symptoms of HCV infection, especially in its early stages, can be mild enough to conceal the fact of the disease; thus, some people do not seek treatment. As Live Aid founder Bob Geldof states, \"Stigma, shame and fear can suffocate awareness. These barriers prevent people from getting tested, receiving treatment, and clearing themselves of this disease\". A number of celebrities diagnosed with the disease have decided to go public in order to raise awareness about hepatitis C and to encourage more people to get tested for the disease.\n"}

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union it was one of the conspicuous New Age movements in the former republics, with about 80,000 members by official count.\n\nTsvigun was born in 1960 in Stalino, Ukrainian SSR, USSR. She served as a functionary for the Young Communist League district committee, worked as a newspaper journalist and an editor for Donetsk textile factory radio network.\nIn 1990 she attended lectures by Yuri Krivonogov, the \"White Brotherhood\" co-founder, who recognized Tsvigun as a new messiah and later received the role of \"Higher Priest\" of the Great White Brotherhood.\nThe members were required to renounce their family ties and donate money and property to the Brotherhood. The Great White Brotherhood came into conflict with the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nTsvigun predicted the Time of Apocalypse and the coming of the Holy Spirit on November 10, 1993. The event was supposed to be accompanied by her sermons in the Sophia Cathedral. On the appointed day, the members of the Brotherhood stormed the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev and were arrested.\n\nAccording to the report of the Orthodox Church, Kiev City Court found Tsvigun and Krivonogov guilty of violating citizens' health under the guise of religious ceremonies and seizing by force.

From 1984 to 2008, he was also a part-time judge at the Swiss Federal Court.\n\nOne study conducted by Killias looked at 18 different countries and found a moderate correlation between gun ownership rates and homicide rates across these countries, as well as a much stronger correlation between gun ownership rates and suicide rates. Another study by him found that gun ownership in Switzerland may have increased domestic crime rates in that country.\n\nKillias has said that \"the fewer guns there are in cellars, attics and armoires, then that would be helpful, because there is a strong correlation between guns kept in private homes and incidences occurring at home - like private disputes involving the husband shooting the wife and maybe the children, and then committing suicide.\" He has also said that as the Swiss government reduced the size of its Army, gun violence rates in that country have dropped. In response to those who cite Switzerland as evidence that guns deter violence, Killias has said that in Switzerland, \"We have guns at home, but they are kept for peaceful purposes. There is no point taking the gun out of your home in Switzerland because it is illegal to carry a gun in the street.

They built temples (\"heiau\"), fishponds, roads, canoes, and houses. Some of these structures that Hawaiian folklore attributed to the Menehune still exist. They are said to have lived in Hawaii before settlers arrived from Polynesia many centuries ago. Their favorite food is the \"maia\" (banana), and they also like fish.\n\nIn Martha Warren Beckwith's \"Hawaiian Mythology\", there are references to several other forest dwelling races: the \"Nawao\", who were large-sized wild hunters descended from Lua-nuu, the \"mu\" people, and the \"wa\" people.\n\nSome early scholars theorized that there was a first settlement of Hawaii, by settlers from the Marquesas Islands, and a second, from Tahiti. The Tahitian settlers oppressed the \"commoners\", the \"manahune\" in the Tahitian language, who fled to the mountains and were called Menahune. Proponents of this theory point to an 1820 census of Kauai by Kaumualii, the ruling \"alii aimoku\" of the island, which listed 65 people as \"menehune\".\n\nFolklorist Katharine Luomala believes that the legends of the \"Menehune\" are a post-European contact mythology created by adaptation of the term \"manahune\" (which by the time of the colonizing of the Hawaiian Islands by Europeans had acquired a meaning of \"lowly people\" or \"low social status\" and not diminutive in stature) to European legends of brownies. '\"It is claimed that \"Menehune\" are not mentioned in pre-contact mythology, although this is unproven since it was clearly an oral mythology; the legendary \"overnight\" creation of the Alekoko fishpond, for example, finds its equivalent in the legend about the creation of a corresponding structure on Oahu, which was supposedly indeed completed in a single day — not by \"menehune\" but, as a show of power, by a local \"alii\" who demanded every one of his subjects to appear at the construction site and assist in building.\n\nNo physical evidence for the existence of a historical person that fits the description of the Menehune has been discovered.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hazmi later traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance. He returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.\n\nAlready long time affiliates of al-Qaeda with extensive fighting experience, Hazmi and Mihdhar were chosen by Osama bin Laden for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airlines into designated targets in the United States. Hazmi and Mihdhar both obtained US tourist visas in April 1999. Hazmi trained in an al-Qaeda training camp in the fall of 1999. He traveled to Malaysia for the 2000 Al-Qaeda Summit.\n\nHazmi arrived in Los Angeles, California, from Bangkok, Thailand, on January 15, 2000, with Khalid al-Mihdhar. The two settled in San Diego, staying at the Parkwood Apartments until May 2000. While in San Diego, they attended its mosque, led by Anwar al-Awlaki. The two took flying lessons during that month in San Diego. Due to Hazmi and Mihdhar's poor English skills, they did not perform well during their flight lessons and their flight instructor regarded them as suspicious.\n\nMihdhar left Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000. Hazmi stayed in California until he met up with Hani Hanjour in December 2000, and they both traveled to Phoenix, Arizona. They later moved to Falls Church, Virginia, in April 2001, where the rest of the hijackers began to join them. Hazmi met frequently with Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the attacks, during the summer of 2001.\n\nThe CIA reportedly received Hazmi's name on a list of 19 persons suspected of planning an attack in the near future. Hazmi was one of the four names on the list who were known for certain. A search for Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced, but they were not located until after the attacks.\n\nOn September 10, 2001, Hazmi, along with Mihdhar and Hanjour checked into a hotel in Herndon, Virginia. The next morning, Hazmi and four other terrorists, boarded American Airlines Flight 77 at Dulles Airport and hijacked the plane so that Hani Hanjour could pilot and crash the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks. The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon. Hazmi was initially dismissed as a \"muscle hijacker\" following the attacks, but was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed. His younger brother, Salem al-Hazmi, was another of the hijackers aboard the same flight.\n\nNawaf was born in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer. He traveled to Afghanistan as a teenager in 1993. CNN's preliminary report following the attacks claimed that an unnamed acquaintance relayed \"He told me once that his father had tried to kill him when he was a child. He never told me why, but he had a long knife scar on his forearm\", and claimed that his older brother was a police chief in Jizan.\n\nIn 1995, he and his childhood friend, Khalid al-Mihdhar, joined a group that went to fight alongside Bosnian Muslims in the Bosnian War. Afterwards, Nawaf returned to Afghanistan along with his brother Salem, and Mihdhar. In Afghanistan, they fought alongside the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance, and joined up with al-Qaeda. Nawaf al-Hazmi returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.\n\nOsama bin Laden held Hazmi and Mihdhar in high respect, with their experience fighting during the 1990s in Bosnia and elsewhere. Al-Qaeda later referred to Hazmi as Mihdhar's \"Second-in-command\". When bin Laden committed to the \"planes operation\" plot in spring 1999, he personally selected Hazmi and Mihdhar to be involved in the plot as pilot hijackers. In addition to Hazmi and Mihdhar, two Yemenis were selected for a southeast Asia component of the plot, which was later scrapped for being too difficult to coordinate with the operations in the United States. Known as \"Rabi'ah al-Makki\" during the preparations, Hazmi had been so eager to participate in operations within the United States, he already had a US visa when bin Laden selected him. Hazmi obtained a B-1/B-2 tourist visa on April 3, 1999, from the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using a new passport he acquired a few weeks earlier. Hazmi's passport did have indicators of al-Qaeda association, but immigration inspectors were not trained to look for those.\n\nIn the autumn of 1999, these four attended the Mes Aynak training camp in Afghanistan, which provided advanced training. Hazmi went with the two Yemenis, Tawfiq bin Attash (Khallad) and Abu Bara al Yemeni, to Karachi, Pakistan, where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the plot's coordinator, instructed him on western culture, travel, as well as taught some basic English phrases. Mihdhar did not go with him to Karachi, but instead left for Yemen. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed then sent Hazmi and the other men to Malaysia for a meeting. Before leaving for Malaysia, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed doctored Hazmi's Saudi passport in order to conceal his travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make it appear that Hazmi had come to Malaysia from Saudi Arabia via Dubai.\n\nAfter the attacks, the Associated Press would re-publish a \"bizarre\" story by the \"Cody Enterprise\" that quoted witnesses stating that Nawaf entered the United States during the autumn of 1999, crossing along the Canada–US border as one of two men delivering skylights to the local high school in Cody, Wyoming. Leaving the city 45 minutes later with the remaining cardboard boxes, the men allegedly asked \"how to get to Florida.\"\n\nBased on information uncovered by the FBI in the 1998 United States embassy bombings case, the National Security Agency (NSA) began tracking the communications of Mihdhar's father-in-law, Ahmad Muhammad Ali al-Hada, who was facilitating al-Qaeda communications, in 1999. Authorities also became aware of Hazmi, as a friend and associate of Mihdhar. Saudi Intelligence was also aware that Hazmi was associated with al-Qaeda, and associated with the 1998 African embassy bombings and attempts to smuggle arms into the kingdom in 1997. He also said that he revealed this to the CIA, saying \"What we told them was these people were on our watch list from previous activities of al-Qaeda\" The CIA strongly denies having received any such warning.\n\nIn late 1999, the NSA informed the CIA of an upcoming meeting in Malaysia, which Hada mentioned would involve \"Khalid\", \"Nawaf\", and \"Salem\". On January 5, Hazmi arrived in Kuala Lumpur, where he met up with Mihdhar, Attash, and Abu Bara. The group was in Malaysia to meet with Hambali for the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit, during which key details of the attacks may have been arranged. At this time, there was an East Asia component to the September 11 attacks plot, but bin Laden later canceled it for being too difficult to coordinate with operations in the United States. Ramzi bin al-Shibh was also at the summit, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed possibly attended the summit. In Malaysia, the group stayed with Yazid Sufaat, a local member of Jemaah Islamiyah, who provided accommodations at request of Hambali. Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were secretly photographed at the meeting by Malaysian authorities, who provided surveillance at the request of the CIA. Malaysian authorities reported that Mihdhar spoke at length with Tawfiq bin Attash, one of the Yemenis, and others who were later involved in the USS Cole bombing. Hazmi and Mihdhar also met with Fahd al-Quso, who was later involved in the USS Cole bombing. After the meeting, Mihdhar and Hazmi traveled to Bangkok in Thailand on January 8, and left a week later on January 15 to travel to the United States.\n\nOn January 15, 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived together at Los Angeles International Airport from Bangkok, and were admitted for a six-month period. Immediately after entering the country, Nawaf and Mihdhar met Omar al-Bayoumi in an airport restaurant. Bayoumi claims he was merely being charitable in helping the two seemingly out-of-place Muslims to move to San Diego where he helped them find an apartment near his own, co-signed their lease, and gave them $1,500 to help pay their rent.\n\nWhile in San Diego, witnesses told the FBI he and Mindhar had a close relationship with Anwar Al Awlaki. Authorities say the two regularly attended the Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami mosque Awlaki led in San Diego, and Awlaki had many closed-door meetings with them. Hazmi got a part-time job through the mosque at a nearby car wash.\n\nIn the beginning of February 2000, Mihdhar and Hazmi rented an apartment at the Parkwood Apartments, a 175-unit complex in the Clairemont Mesa section of San Diego, near the Balboa Drive Mosque. In February, Mihdhar purchased a used 1988 Toyota Corolla. While living at the Parkwood Apartments, neighbors thought that Mihdhar and Hazmi were odd. Months passed without them getting any furniture for the apartment. Instead, the men slept on mattresses on the floor, yet they carried briefcases, were frequently on their mobile phones, and were occasionally picked up by a limousine. After the attacks, their neighbors told the media that the pair constantly played flight simulator games. Residents said a total of four men spent time together at Parkwood, playing in the pool like children.\n\nOn April 4, 2000, Hazmi took a one-hour introductory flight lesson at the National Air College in San Diego. Both Mihdhar and Hazmi took flight lessons in May 2000 at the Sorbi Flying Club, located at Montgomery Field in San Diego. On May 5, Hazmi and Mihdhar took a lesson for one hour, and additional lessons on May 10 at the Sorbi Flying Club, with Hazmi flying an aircraft for 30 minutes. However, their English skills were very poor, and they did not do well with flight lessons. The first day that they showed up, they told instructors that they wanted to learn how to fly Boeings. Mihdhar and Hazmi raised some suspicion when they offered extra money to their flight instructor, Richard Garza, if he would train them to fly jets. Suspicious of the two men, Garza refused the offer but did not report them to authorities. Garza described the two men as \"impatient students\" who \"wanted to learn to fly jets, specifically Boeings.\"\n\nAdel Rafeea received a wire transfer of $5,000, on April 18, from Ali Abdul Aziz Ali in the UAE, which he later claimed was money Nawaf had asked him to accept on his behalf.\n\nAt the end of May 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar moved out of Parkwood Apartments, and moved to nearby Lemon Grove, California. At this time, Mihdhar transferred his vehicle's registration to Hazmi, and he left San Diego on June 10, 2000. Mihdhar returned to Yemen, which angered Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who did not want Hazmi to be left alone in California.\n\nOn July 12, 2000, Hazmi filed for an extension of his visa, which was due to expire. His visa was extended until January 2001, though Hazmi never filed any further requests to extend it beyond that.\n\nIn September, Nawaf and Mihdhar both moved into the house of FBI informant Abdussattar Shaikh, although he did not report the pair as suspicious. Mihdhar is believed to have left the apartment in early October, less than two weeks before the USS Cole Bombing. Nawaf continued living with Shaikh until December.\n\nHani Hanjour arrived in San Diego in early December 2000, joining Hazmi, but on December 10, they were seen leaving their Mount Vernon address leaving for Phoenix, Arizona where Hanjour could take refresher flight training. On December 12, they arrived at Mesa, Arizona and stayed with Mourad Jdaaini and Mike Khalaf. On December 22, Hanjour and Hazmi signed a lease for an apartment in the Indian Springs Village complex in Mesa, moving in on January 9.\n\nIn March, al-Hazmi received a shipment of VHS videos including videos about Boeing 747 and 777 flight decks and \"how an airline captain should look and act\" and later a road atlas, map of New York City and a World aeronautical chart.\n\nOn March 30, al-Hazmi notified his utility company that he might be moving to another state or Saudi Arabia. He and Hanjour moved out before the apartment rental expired at the end of the month on their way to Virginia. 2 days later on April 1, 2001, Oklahoma police officer C. L. Parkins pulled Hazmi over for speeding in their Corolla along with an additional citation for failing to use a seatbelt together totaling $138. A routine inspection of his California drivers license turned up no warrants or alerts, although his name was known to both the NSA and the CIA as a suspected terrorist.\n\nAnwar al-Awlaki had already headed east and served as Imam at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in the metropolitan Washington, DC area starting in January 2001. Shortly after this, his sermons were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers (the new one being Hanjour).\n\nBy April 3, he was likely with companion Hani Hanjour when he was recorded at an ATM in Front Royal, Virginia, arriving in Falls Church, Virginia, by April 4. They met a man believed to be a Jordanian named Eyad Alrababah at a 7-11 that day. The 9-11 commission wrote that Hazmi and Hanjour met Alrababah at the Dar al Hijra mosque who was computer technician who had moved from West Paterson, New Jersey and was there to ask imam Anwar al-Awlaki about finding a job. He helped the pair rent an apartment in Alexandria where they moved in.\n\nThe September 11 Commission concluded that two of the hijackers \"reportedly respected Awlaki as a religious figure\". Police found his telephone number in the contacts of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (the \"20th hijacker\") when they searched his Hamburg apartment while investigating the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn May 1, 2001, Hazmi reported to police that men tried to take his wallet outside his Fairfax, Virginia, residence, but before the county officer left, Hazmi signed a \"statement of release\" indicating he did not want the incident investigated.\n\nIn May 2001, Nidal Hasan's mother's funeral was held at the Falls Church mosque, although it is not known if al-Hazmi attended the service. On May 2, two other hijackers, Ahmed al-Ghamdi and Majed Moqed, arrived in Virginia and moved in with them. On May 8, Alrababah suggested that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar move with him to Fairfield, Connecticut, and helped all four hijackers move to a hotel there. They called area flight schools and after a few days Alrababah drove the four to Paterson, New Jersey, to show them around. Some FBI agents suspected that Awlaki gave Alrababah the job of helping Hazmi and Hanjour. Alrababah was later arrested as a witness convicted after 9/11 in a fraudulent driver's license scheme and deported to Jordan.\n\nOn May 21, al-Hazmi moved in with Hanjour into an apartment in Paterson New Jersey. Mohamed Atta was living in the same city at another location.\n\nOn June 30, al-Hazmi's car was involved in a minor traffic accident on the east-bound George Washington Bridge.\nOn June 25, 2001, al-Hazmi obtained a drivers' license in Florida, providing an address in Delray Beach, Florida, and he obtained a USA ID card on July 10. On August 2, al-Hazmi also obtained a Virginia drivers' license, and made a request for it to be reissued on September 7.\n\nOn July 20, al-hazmi and fellow hijacker Hani Hanjour flew to the Montgomery County Airpark in Maryland from on a practice flight from Fairfield, New Jersey.\n\nAl-Hazmi, along with at least five other future hijackers, traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada, at least six times in the summer of 2001. They reportedly drank alcohol, gambled, and paid strippers to perform lap dances for them.\n\nThroughout the summer, al-Hazmi met with leader Mohamed Atta to discuss the status of the operation of a monthly basis.\n\nOn August 23, Israeli Mossad reportedly gave his name to the CIA as part of a list of 19 names they said were planning an attack in the near future. Only four of the names are known for certain – Narwaf, Atta, al-Shehhi and al-Mihdhar, but again, the connection was not made with previous contacts by local law enforcement. On the same day, he was added to an INS watch list, together with Mihdhar to prevent entry into the US.\n\nAn internal review after 9/11 found that \"everything was done [to find them] that could have been done.\" However, the search does not appear to have been particularly aggressive. A national motor vehicle index was reportedly checked, but Hazmi's speeding ticket was not detected for some reason. The FBI did not search credit card databases, bank account databases, or car registration, all of which would have produced positive results. Hazmi was even listed in the 2000–2001 San Diego phone book, but this too was not searched until after the attacks.\nHe had not been placed on terrorist watch lists, nor did the CIA or NSA alert the FBI, Customs and Immigration, or local police and enforcement agencies.\n\nOn August 27, brothers Nawaf and Salem purchased flight tickets through Travelocity.com using Nawaf's Visa card.\n\nOn September 1, Nawaf registered Room #7 at the Pin-Del Motel in Laurel, Maryland. On the registration, he listed his driver's license number as 3402142-D, and gave a New York hotel as his permanent residence. Ziad Jarrah had checked into the hotel on August 27.\n\nNawaf and Mihdhar purchased their 9/11 plane tickets online using a credit card with their real names. This raised no red flags, since the FAA had not been informed that the two were on a terrorist watchlist.\n\nOn September 10, 2001, Hanjour, Mihdhar, and Nawaf checked into the Marriott Residence Inn in Herndon, Virginia, where Saleh Ibn Abdul Rahman Hussayen, a prominent Saudi government official, was staying – although no evidence was ever uncovered that they had met, or knew of each other's presence.\n\nOn September 11, Hazmi boarded American Airlines Flight 77. The flight was scheduled to depart at 08:10 but ended up departing 10 minutes late from Gate D26 at Dulles. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. At 08:54, the hijackers sent pilots Charles Burlingame and David Charlesbois to the back of the plane. Flight 77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. The hijackers then set the flight's autopilot in the direction of Washington, D.C. Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of the Pentagon, killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers) along with 125 in the Pentagon.\n\nNawaf al-Hazmi's 1988 blue Toyota Corolla was found on the next day in Dulles International Airport's hourly parking lot. Inside the vehicle, authorities found a letter written by Mohamed Atta, maps of Washington, D.C. and New York City, a cashier's check made out to a Phoenix flight school, four drawings of a Boeing 757 cockpit, a box cutter, and a page with notes and phone numbers.\n\nIn the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight 77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any DNA samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI. Forensics teams confirmed that it seemed two of the hijackers were brothers, based on their DNA similarities.\n\nSeveral weeks after the attacks, a Las Vegas Days Inn employee went to the FBI and stated that she recognized Hazmi's photographs from the media as being a man she had met at the hotel, who had asked for details on hotels near Los Angeles. She admitted that he never gave his name.\n\nLate in 2005, Army Lt. Col. Kevin Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon alleged that the Defense Department data mining project Able Danger had kept Nawaf, Khalid al-Mihdhar, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi all under surveillance as al-Qaeda agents.\n\n\n"}

Before entering the slave trade, Blanco ran a sugar mill in Cuba.\n\nBlanco sailed to Africa on the \"Conquistador\", one of his ships. He began trading in African slaves in 1822, and by 1839 he controlled a network that fed Cuba's insatiable hunger for plantation workers. Blanco expanded his operation by establishing a working relationship with the African King Siaka.\n\nHe eventually had agents stationed at Cape Mount, Shebar, Digby, Nuevo Sestos and elsewhere. Blanco entered a partnership with one Lino Carballo, with a center of operations in Havana and other branches in Puerto Rico, Trinidad, and the Republic of Texas. His mercantile standing was so high that his credit bills were enthusiastically accepted in New York City, London and many other well-known financial centers.\n\nIn Gallinas, Blanco built himself a private kingdom with storehouses on an island, his office on another island, and houses for his African wives on yet a third island. Slaves awaiting shipment were housed on the islands of Taro and Kamasun. In 1838, Blanco left Africa for Cuba and went to Barcelona, all the time trading in slaves. He left Gallinas just before most of the \"La Amistad\" Africans reached his stockades, but he left behind a network of employees to continue his business. It is likely that some of them handled the \"Amistad\" Africans. At any rate, he played a vital part in the development of the slave trade in this region. Blanco's business finally collapsed in 1848, and in 1854 he died in Genoa.\n\n"}

Credico is an American perennial political candidate, comedian, radio host, activist and the former Director of the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice.\n\nCredico was once active on the comedy circuit, and at the age of 27 he made an appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\" During the appearance, he criticized U.S. foreign policy and compared Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to Eva Braun; Credico was not invited back to the show, and some believe this is due to the Kirkpatrick impersonation. He was featured on the 1988 comedy album, \"Strange Bedfellows: Comedy and Politics\" along with Jimmy Tingle, Barry Crimmins, and Will Durst.\n\nCredico spent four years in Tulia, Texas, bringing national attention to a racially charged mass drug arrest. The Kunstler Fund produced an award-winning documentary on the subject entitled \"Tulia, Texas: Scenes from the drug war\", written, directed and edited by Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler. Credico is the subject of the film \"Sixty Spins Around the Sun\", directed by comedian Laura Kightlinger.\n\nCredico produced, directed and wrote the radio program \"60 Mimics\", and is a frequent guest on \"Live from the State Capitol with Fred Dicker\", a political talk radio program on WGDJ in Albany, New York.\n\nAt age 37, Credico began a periodic campaign against New York state's Rockefeller drug laws, which he claimed were too harsh, disproportionately affecting the poor and minorities. Small changes softening the stiffest penalties were passed in the state legislature, which Credico thought were insufficient.\n\nIn 2009, Credico attended a meeting of the New York State Senate on Open Government dressed as the Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic, \"seeking an honest politician.\" In the early 2010s, Credico became a perennial candidate for political office.\n\nCredico's most notable appearance in the 2016 election cycle was headlining a Republican fund-raiser in Cayuga County, New York.\n\nCredico ran as a Democratic primary challenger against Senator Chuck Schumer in 2010. Credico submitted petitions in an effort to get onto the Democratic Party primary ballot. The party chairman claimed that Credico only submitted a few pages' worth of petitions to the state, far short of the 15,000 necessary, a charge Credico denied. Credico threatened to throw his support to Republican candidate Carl Paladino in the gubernatorial race. He made the ballot.\n\nCredico's campaign was supported by several actors and comedians, including \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David, Roseanne Barr, and \"Professor\" Irwin Corey. He was nominated by the Libertarian Party of New York and the nascent \"Anti-Prohibition Party\" of Kristin \"Manhattan Madam\" Davis, though those parties do not have permanent ballot access and were required to petition their way onto the ballot. Credico finished with 25,975 votes (0.6%), in last place among the four candidates; in most jurisdictions, Credico was only given one ballot line despite petitioning for two.\n\nCredico sued the New York State Board of Elections under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment over this issue of ballot access. On June 19, 2013, the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled in favor of Credico. The New York State Board of Elections did not appeal this decision.\n\nCredico ran for the Democratic nomination for Mayor of New York City in the 2013 election. He received 12,685 votes (2.0%). He also appeared on the ballot in the general election with 14 other candidates, on the Tax Wall Street line, receiving 654 votes (0.1%).\n\nCredico challenged incumbent Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo in the 2014 Democratic primary. He came in third among three candidates, with 20,760 votes (3.6%).\n\nIn November 2017, Roger Stone told the House Intelligence Committee that Credico was his intermediary with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to obtain information on Hillary Clinton. Credico was then subpoenaed to appear before the committee, and his attorney said he would comply. Credico subsequently asserted his Fifth Amendment rights before an interview with the committee, which then released him from appearing. In August 2018, Credico's attorney made public that special counsel Mueller had subpoenaed Credico to testify before a grand jury in September 2018. According to his attorney, Credico intends to comply with the request. In October 2018 \"Mother Jones\" reported that Credico had received text messages from Roger Stone in January 2018 stating that Stone was seeking a presidential pardon for Assange. In November 2018, \"NBC News\" revealed that through Julian Assange's attorney Margaret Ratner Kunstler who is the widow of William Kunstler, Credico knew on August 27, 2016, that Wikileaks would release information about the Hillary Clinton campaign in the near future and sent a text message to Roger Stone that \"Julian Assange has kryptonite on Hillary.\" Credico continued to give Stone updates about the subsequent release on Wikileaks of numerous emails stolen from Podesta and the Hillary Clinton campaign which were released beginning on October 7, 2016.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26713474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26713474", "title": "Rick Santorum", "text": "Rick Santorum\n\nRichard John Santorum (born May 10, 1958) is an American politician, attorney, author, and political commentator. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007 and was the Senate's third-ranking Republican from 2001 to 2007. Santorum ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, finishing second to Mitt Romney.\n\nSantorum was elected to the United States Senate from Pennsylvania in 1994. He served two terms until losing his 2006 reelection bid. A Roman Catholic, Santorum is a social conservative who opposes abortion and same-sex marriage and embraced a culture warrior image during his Senate tenure. While serving as a senator, Santorum authored the Santorum Amendment, which would have promoted the teaching of intelligent design. He was a leading sponsor of the 2003 federal law known as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. \n\nIn the years following his departure from the Senate, Santorum worked as a consultant, private practice lawyer, and news contributor. He ran for the Republican nomination in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Before suspending his campaign on April 10, 2012, Santorum exceeded expectations by winning 11 primaries and caucuses and receiving nearly four million votes, making him the runner-up to eventual nominee Mitt Romney. Santorum ran for president again in 2016, but ended his campaign in February 2016 after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. In January 2017, he became a CNN senior political commentator.\nRichard John Santorum was born in Winchester, Virginia. He is the middle of the three children of Aldo Santorum (1923–2011), a clinical psychologist who immigrated to the United States at age seven from Riva, Trentino, Italy, and Catherine (Dughi) Santorum (b. 1918), an administrative nurse who is of Italian and Irish ancestry.\n\nSantorum grew up in Berkeley County, West Virginia, and Butler County, Pennsylvania. In West Virginia, his family lived in an apartment provided by the Veterans Administration. Santorum attended elementary school at Butler Catholic School and then went on to the Butler Senior High School. He was nicknamed \"Rooster\", supposedly for both a cowlick strand of hair and an assertive nature, particularly on important political issues. After his parents transferred to the Naval Station Great Lakes in northern Illinois, Santorum attended the Roman Catholic Carmel High School in Mundelein, Illinois, for one year, graduating in 1976.\n\nSantorum attended Pennsylvania State University for his undergraduate studies, serving as chairman of the university's College Republicans chapter and graduating with a BA degree with honors in political science in 1980. While at Penn State, Santorum joined the Tau Epsilon Phi fraternity. He then completed a one-year MBA program at the University of Pittsburgh's Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, graduating in 1981. In 1986, Santorum received a JD degree with honors from Dickinson School of Law.\n\nSantorum first became actively involved in politics in the 1970s through volunteering for Senator John Heinz, a Republican from Pennsylvania. Additionally, while working on his law degree, Santorum was an administrative assistant to Republican state senator Doyle Corman, serving as director of the Pennsylvania Senate's local government committee from 1981 to 1984, then director of its transportation committee.\n\nAfter graduating, Santorum was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar and practiced law for four years at the Pittsburgh law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, a firm known for raising political candidates and lobbyists (later named K&L Gates). As an associate, he successfully lobbied on behalf of the World Wrestling Federation to deregulate professional wrestling, arguing that it should be exempt from federal anabolic steroid regulations because it was entertainment, not a sport. Santorum left his private law practice in 1990 after his election to the House of Representatives.\n\nHaving been groomed by Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, Santorum decided Democratic congressman Doug Walgren was vulnerable, and took up residence in Walgren's district. Needing money and political support, he courted GOP activist and major donor Elsie Hillman, the chair of the state Republican Party.\nIn 1990, at age 32, Santorum was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, located in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh. He scored a significant upset in the heavily Democratic district, defeating seven-term Democratic incumbent Doug Walgren by a 51%–49% margin. During his campaign Santorum repeatedly criticized Walgren for living outside the district for most of the year. Although the 18th District was redrawn for the 1992 elections, and the new district had a 3:1 ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans, Santorum still won reelection with 61% of the vote.\n\nIn 1993, Santorum was one of 17 House Republicans who sided with most Democrats to support legislation that prohibited employers from permanently replacing striking employees. He also joined a minority of Republicans to vote against the North American Free Trade Agreement that year. As a member of the Gang of Seven, Santorum was involved in exposing members of Congress involved in the House banking scandal.\n\nSantorum served in the United States Senate representing Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007. From 2001 until 2007, he was the Senate's third-ranking Republican. He was first elected to the Senate during the 1994 Republican takeover, narrowly defeating incumbent Democrat Harris Wofford, 49% to 47%. The theme of Santorum's 1994 campaign signs was \"Join the Fight!\" During the race, he was considered an underdog, as his opponent was 32 years his senior. He was reelected in 2000, defeating U.S. Congressman Ron Klink by a 52–46% margin. In his reelection bid of 2006, he lost to Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. by a 59–41% margin.\n\nAfter his election to the Senate in 1994, Santorum sought to \"practice what [he] preached\" and hired five people for his staff who were on welfare, food stamps, or other government aid.\n\nIn 1996, Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform, and contributed to legislation that became the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Santorum was an author and the floor manager of the bill. In 1996, Santorum endorsed moderate Republican Arlen Specter in his short-lived campaign for president. Reporters have observed that though Santorum and Specter differed on social policy, Specter provided him with key political staff for his successful run in 1994.\n\nThe National Taxpayers Union, a fiscal conservative organization, gave Santorum an \"A−\" score for his votes on fiscal issues, meaning that he was one of \"the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies\" during his tenure, and ranked fifth in the group's rankings out of 50 senators who served at the same time.\n\nIn 2002, Santorum was a co-sponsor of that year's attempt to pass the Workplace Religious Freedom Act (WRFA). The bill had first been introduced in the Senate by Senator John Kerry (D-MA) in 1996, having been introduced in the House by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) in 1994. Although Santorum was in the Senate at the time, he was not a sponsor of the bill when it was introduced in 1996, or when it was reintroduced in 1997 and 1999. Once signed on as a co-sponsor, Santorum remained so throughout his tenure in the Senate.\n\nSantorum founded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom in 2003. The group included members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and met monthly to address issues such as the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, tax-exempt status for churches, the CARE act, international religious freedom, and antisemitism.\n\nSantorum added to the 2001 No Child Left Behind bill a provision that would have provided more freedom to schools in teaching about the origins of life, including the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution. The bill, with the Santorum Amendment included, passed the Senate 91–8 and was hailed as a victory by intelligent design promoters, but before it became law, scientific and educational groups successfully urged its conference committee to strike the Santorum Amendment from the final version. Intelligent design supporters in Congress then preserved the language of the Santorum Amendment in the conference committee report of the bill's legislative history. The Discovery Institute and other intelligent design proponents point to this report as \"a clear endorsement by Congress of the importance of teaching a variety of scientific views about the theory of evolution.\"\n\nIn 2002, Santorum called intelligent design \"a legitimate scientific theory that should be taught in science classes\", but by 2005 he had adopted the Teach the Controversy approach. He told National Public Radio, \"I'm not comfortable with intelligent design being taught in the science classroom. What we should be teaching are the problems and holes ... in the theory of evolution.\" Later that year, Santorum resigned from the advisory board of the Christian-rights Thomas More Law Center after the Center's lawyers lost a case representing a school board that had required the teaching of intelligent design. Santorum, who had previously supported the school board's policy, indicated he had not realized that certain members of the board had been motivated by religious beliefs. Santorum critics said he was backtracking from his earlier position because he was facing a tough reelection fight in 2006. When asked in November 2011 about his views on evolution, Santorum stated that he believes that evolution occurred on a tiny, micro level.\n\nSantorum introduced the National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005, which aimed to prohibit the National Weather Service from releasing weather data to the public without charge where private-sector entities perform the same function commercially. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association was organizing a lobbying effort in opposition to the legislation, but it never passed committee. The motivations for the bill were controversial, as employees of AccuWeather, a commercial weather company based in Pennsylvania, donated $10,500 to Santorum and his PAC. The liberal advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington cited the bill as one of several reasons for listing Santorum as one of its \"most corrupt politicians\". In support of the bill, Santorum criticized the National Weather Service in September 2005, saying its evacuation warnings for Hurricane Katrina were \"insufficient\".\n\nSantorum is a supporter of the War on Terror and shares the views of neoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine in regard to foreign policy. He felt the War in Iraq was justified, and, in 2006, declared that weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) had been found in Iraq. Santorum made the declaration regarding WMDs based in part on declassified portions of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command. The report stated that coalition forces had recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions that contain degraded or vacant mustard or sarin nerve agent casings. The specific weapons he referred to were chemical munitions dating back to the Iran–Iraq War that were buried in the early 1990s. The report stated that while agents had degraded to an unknown degree, they remained dangerous and possibly lethal. Officials of the Department of Defense, CIA intelligence analysts, and the White House have all explicitly stated that these expired casings were not part of the WMDs threat that the Iraq War was launched to contain.\n\nSantorum has said the war on terror can be won and is optimistic about U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan in the long term. He has defended the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, including waterboarding, and stated that John McCain, who opposes the practice, \"doesn't understand how enhanced interrogation works.\" Santorum called the War in Afghanistan \"a very winnable operation\" in 2012, dismissing efforts for withdrawal by 2014. He similarly criticized President Obama's foreign policy, saying he was \"not focused on trying to win the war\" in Afghanistan, and said he was against any withdrawal in Iraq in 2012, saying, \"We want victory.\"\n\nSantorum supports U.S. political intervention and economic sanctions against state sponsors of terrorism. He views \"Islamic-fascism\" in Iran as the center of the \"world's conflict\", and his geopolitical strategy for peace involves the United States promoting \"a strong Lebanon, a strong Israel, and a strong Iraq.\" He sponsored the Syria Accountability Act of 2003 to require Syria to cease all activity with Lebanon and end all support for terrorism. In 2005, Santorum sponsored the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which appropriated $10 million aimed at regime change in Iran. The Act passed with overwhelming support. Santorum voted against the Lautenberg amendment, which would have closed the loophole that allows companies like Halliburton to do business with Iran through their foreign affiliates. Santorum reflected on his last year in the Senate as one spent talking a lot about Iran, and was characterized by \"The Atlantic Wire\" as an \"extreme hawk\" in his approach to Iran. Santorum stated that Iran was the creator of Hezbollah and the driving force of Hamas. He said Iran was at the center of \"much of the world's conflict\" but he was opposed to direct military action against the country in 2006. Santorum was one of only two senators who voted against confirming Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. He said his objection was to Gates's support for talking with Iran and Syria, because it would be an error to talk with radical Islamists.\n\nSantorum became chairman of the Senate Republican Conference in 2000, the party's third-ranking leadership position in the Senate. In that role, he directed Senate Republicans' communications operations and was a frequent party spokesperson. He was the youngest member of the Senate leadership and the first Pennsylvanian to hold such a prominent position since Senator Hugh Scott was Republican leader in the 1970s. In addition, Santorum served on the Senate Agriculture Committee; the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; the Senate Special Committee on Aging; and the Senate Finance Committee, of which he was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy. He also sat at the candy desk for ten years.\n\nIn January 2005, Santorum announced his intention to run for Senate Republican Whip, the second-highest post in the Republican caucus after the 2006 election, saying he expected the incumbent whip, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to run for Senate Republican leader to succeed Bill Frist of Tennessee, who was planning to retire. As a result of Santorum's loss in the 2006 election, this plan was never realized.\n\nBeginning in 1995, Republicans leaders such as Tom DeLay and Grover Norquist initiated an order to place Republicans in lobbying firm jobs, and exclude Democrats. In addition, the initiative pressured lobbying firms to contribute to Republican campaigns, by withholding access to lawmakers from firms that did not comply. The initiative became politically toxic for Republicans when the Jack Abramoff scandal broke in late 2004. Although some sources indicate that Santorum played a key role in the K Street Project, he has denied any involvement. In November 2005, several months after the indictments of Abramoff and DeLay, Santorum told the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", \"The K Street project is purely to make sure we have qualified applicants for positions that are in town. From my perspective, it's a good government thing.\" A few months later, however, Santorum emphatically denied any connection with either the K Street Project or Norquist, saying: \"I had absolutely nothing to do—never met, never talked, never coordinated, never did anything—with Grover Norquist and the quote K Street Project.\" In January 2012, \"The Washington Post\"'s \"Fact Checker\" concluded that \"we can't prove definitively whether or not Santorum collaborated on the K Street Project\", saying that it \"depend[ed] on how you define the initiative\".\n\nIn 2006, Santorum sought reelection to a third Senate term. He ran unopposed in the Republican Party. His seat was considered among the most vulnerable for Republicans and was a prime target of the Democratic Party in the 2006 elections. George W. Bush had a 38% approval rating in Pennsylvania in 2006. Mary Isenhour, a Democratic strategist, reflected on Santorum's campaign and his connection to the unpopular president, \"In 2006, we were doubly blessed—we could run against George W. Bush and Rick Santorum\". Santorum chose to campaign alongside George W. Bush, and called him a \"terrific president\", hurting his popularity. Also problematic was Santorum's 2004 endorsement of his Republican Senate colleague Arlen Specter over conservative Congressman Pat Toomey in the primary for Pennsylvania's other Senate seat. Many socially and fiscally conservative Republicans considered the endorsement a betrayal of their cause.\n\nSantorum's opponent was Democratic State Treasurer Bob Casey, Jr., the son of popular former governor Robert Casey, Sr. Casey was well known for his opposition to abortion, negating one of Santorum's key issues. For most of the campaign, Santorum trailed Casey by 15 points or more in polls. Green Party candidate Carl Romanelli failed to gain ballot access in the race, further hurting Santorum's chances. Reportedly, several of Santorum's supporters had funded and petitioned for Romanelli to siphon away Democrats from Casey.\n\nSantorum was mired in controversy and spent much of his time on the campaign defending his past statements and positions. He faced criticism from Casey and others for several statements in his book, \"It Takes a Family\", including his denunciation of 1960s \"radical feminism\", which he said had made it \"socially affirming to work outside the home\" at the expense of child care. In the book, Santorum also compared pro-choice Americans to \"German Nazis.\" John Brabender, an adviser to Santorum's Senate and Presidential races, reflected back on the book's controversies and said Santorum was warned that sections could bring political damage, and Santorum was not willing to change much of it simply to gain moderate supporters. In addition, a past article Santorum wrote to \"The Catholic Online\" resurfaced in 2005, in which he linked liberalism and moral relativism in American society, particularly within seminaries, to the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal. He wrote, \"... it is no surprise that Boston, a seat of academic, political and cultural liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm.\" His remarks were heavily criticized, especially in Massachusetts, and he was asked for an explanation. Santorum did not retract his statement and defended his premise that it was \"no surprise that the center of the Catholic Church abuse took place in very liberal, or perhaps the nation's most liberal area, Boston.\" Casey also raised the question of Santorum's association with the K Street Project.\n\nSantorum said he spent \"maybe a month a year\" at his Pennsylvania home, raising allegations of hypocrisy as he had denounced his former opponent Doug Walgren for living away from his House district. Critics also complained that Pennsylvania taxpayers were paying 80% of the tuition for five of Santorum's children to attend an online \"cyber school\"—a benefit available only to Pennsylvania residents—when all his children lived in Virginia. The Penn Hills School District, which covered the tuition costs for the cyber school through local taxes, unsuccessfully filed a complaint against Santorum for reimbursement in 2005, but won reimbursement from the state in September 2006 in the amount of $55,000. In response, Santorum asked county officials to remove the homestead tax exemption from his Penn Hills property, saying he was entitled to it but chose not to take it because of the political dispute. Since 2006, Santorum has been home-schooling his seven children. Santorum responded to the dispute saying that his children should not be implicated in the \"politics of personal destruction\". One of his children appeared in a 2006 reelection campaign ad saying, \"My dad's opponents have criticized him for moving us to Washington so we could be with him more.\"\n\nSantorum ran a television ad suggesting that Casey's supporters had been under investigation for various crimes. The negative ad backfired, as \"The Scranton Times-Tribune\" found that all but a few of Casey's contributors donated when he was running for other offices, and none were investigated for anything. In fact, two of the persons cited in Santorum's campaign ad actually contributed to Santorum in 2006, and one died in 2004. Santorum's campaign countered that those donations were not kept, and had been donated to educational institutions.\n\nToward the end of his campaign, Santorum shifted his theme to the threat of radical Islam. In October 2006 he gave a \"Gathering Storm\" speech, invoking British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's description of Europe prior to World War II. As evidence that Islamists were waging a more than 300-year-old crusade against the Western world, Santorum pointed to September 11, 1683, the date of the Battle of Vienna. Casey responded, \"No one believes terrorists are going to be more likely to attack us because I defeat Rick Santorum.\" Noting that he had been \"even more hawkish\" during this time period than President Bush, Santorum later said, \"Maybe that wasn’t the smartest political strategy, spending the last few months running purely on national security\".\n\nA heated debate between the candidates occurred on October 11, 2006. Bill Toland of the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" described both candidates' performances during the debate as \"unstatesmanlike\".\n\nIn the November 7, 2006, election, Santorum lost by over 700,000 votes, receiving 41% of the vote to Casey's 59%. This was the largest margin of defeat for a sitting senator in the 2006 cycle, and the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent senator since 1980.\n\nIn 1994, Sylvester Stallone contributed $1,000 to then-Congressman Santorum's first Senate campaign.\n\nJim Caviezel donated $2,100 to Santorum's 2006 reelection campaign.\n\nIn January 2007, Santorum joined the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a D.C.-based conservative think tank, as director of its America's Enemies Program focusing on foreign threats to the United States, including Islamic fascism, Venezuela, North Korea and Russia. In February 2007, he signed a deal to become a contributor on the Fox News Channel, offering commentary on politics and public policy. In March 2007 he joined Eckert Seamans, where he primarily practiced law in the firm's Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., offices, providing business and strategic counseling services to the firm's clients. In 2007, he joined the Board of Directors of Universal Health Services, a hospital management company based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. He also began writing an Op-Ed column, \"The Elephant in the Room\", for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\".\n\nSantorum earned $1.3 million in 2010 and the first half of 2011. The largest portion of his earnings—$332,000—came from his work as a consultant for industry interest groups, including Consol Energy and American Continental Group. Santorum also earned $395,414 in corporate director's fees and stock options from Universal Health Services, and $217,385 in income from the Ethics and Public Policy Center. In 2010 he was paid $23,000 by \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" for his work as a columnist.\n\nIn January 2017, Santorum became a CNN senior political commentator.\n\nBefore the 2006 election, Santorum was frequently mentioned as a possible 2008 presidential candidate. Such speculation faded when, during the 2006 campaign and in light of unimpressive poll numbers in his Senate race, he declared that, if reelected, he would serve a full term. After he lost, Santorum once again ruled out a presidential run.\n\nOn February 1, 2008, Santorum said he would vote for Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary. Santorum criticized John McCain, questioning his pro-life voting record and conservative values. Santorum later said he endorsed Romney because he saw him as the \"best chance to stop John McCain\", whom he considered too moderate. In September 2008, Santorum expressed support for McCain as the nominee, citing McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate as a step in the right direction.\n\nSantorum was mentioned as a candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania in 2010. At one point, he was said to have \"quietly but efficiently put his fingerprints on a wide array of conservative causes in the state.\" Santorum declined to seek the gubernatorial nomination and instead endorsed eventual winner Tom Corbett.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Santorum gave a speech at the University of Dubuque on the economy, fueling speculation that he would run for president in 2012. Santorum later recalled, \"It got a lot of buzz on the Internet, so I thought, 'Wow, maybe there's some interest'\". He decided to campaign after multiple conversations with his wife, who was not enthusiastic at first.\n\nOn September 11, 2009, Santorum spoke to Catholic leaders in Orlando, Florida, saying that the 2012 presidential elections were going to be \"a real opportunity for success.\" He then scheduled various appearances in Iowa with political nonprofit organizations.\n\nOn January 15, 2010, Santorum sent an email and letter to supporters of his political action committee, saying, \"I'm convinced that conservatives need a candidate who will not only stand up for our views, but who can articulate a conservative vision for our country's future\". He continued, \"And right now, I just don't see anyone stepping up to the plate. I have no great burning desire to be president, but I have a burning desire to have a different president of the United States\". He formed a presidential exploratory committee on April 13, 2011. Santorum also mentioned his grandfather's historical encounter with Italian fascism as an inspiration for his presidential campaign.\n\nHe formally announced his run for the Republican presidential nomination on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on June 6, 2011, saying he's \"in it to win.\" He initially lagged in the polls, but gained as other conservative candidates slumped. By the weekend before the Iowa caucuses, polls showed him in the top three, along with Romney and Ron Paul. The \"Des Moines Register\" also noted that the momentum was with Santorum. In the closest finish in the history of the Iowa caucuses, the count on the night put Romney as winner by a margin of eight votes, but the final result announced two weeks later showed that Santorum had won by 34 votes. Santorum later focused on the states holding votes on February 7, a strategy that paid off as he won all three. Santorum surged in polls taken shortly after, ranking first in some and a close second in others. In the March 13 primaries, Santorum narrowly won both Mississippi and Alabama and followed up with a victory in Louisiana on March 24.\n\nFollowing the hospitalization of his daughter Bella and losses in Wisconsin, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, Santorum announced the suspension of his campaign on April 10, 2012, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He had won 11 state primaries and nearly 4 million votes, more than any other candidate except Romney. Santorum topped Romney in polls for a brief period. Upon the conclusion of Santorum's run, Romney called him \"an important voice\" in the GOP.\n\nSantorum received a primetime speaking slot at the 2012 Republican National Convention. He was originally slated to speak early in the evening, but convention organizers moved him to 9 pm with the other highly anticipated speakers of the evening, Ann Romney and convention keynote Chris Christie. Santorum spoke of the American dream his immigrant grandfather worked to give his family, and said Obama was turning the dream into a nightmare. He talked about his experiences on the presidential campaign trail, speaking with emotion about his daughter Bella and meeting disabled people and their families. He emphasized the importance of strengthening marriage and the family. He also condemned Obama's actions on the welfare reform law, of which he was one of the chief proponents in Congress, and his actions on education, including school choice and student loans. Santorum concluded his speech to a standing ovation, saying,\nIn June 2012, Santorum launched Patriot Voices, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with a mission to \"mobilize conservatives around this country who are committed to promoting faith, family, freedom and opportunity\" in support of causes and candidates across the country. Santorum supported U.S. Senate candidates Ted Cruz in Texas and Richard Mourdock in Indiana in their respective Republican primaries; both won. In the general elections, Patriot Voices endorsed eight U.S. Senate candidates and four House candidates. In Iowa's 2012 retention elections Santorum lent support to the \"NO Wiggins\" effort to oust Iowa Supreme Court Justice David Wiggins, who they say promulgated a personal political agenda in the court. They have also been vocal in opposition to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which they say threatens parental rights and U.S. sovereignty.\n\nIn June 2013, Santorum became Chairman and CEO of EchoLight Studios, a Dallas-based Christian movie company. Santorum has produced the Christmas-themed movie \"The Christmas Candle\" and the religious liberty film \"One Generation Away\".\n\nAppearing on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on August 4, 2013, Santorum said, \"I’m open to looking into a presidential race in 2016.\" He outlined plans for a potential 2016 run in an interview with \"The Washington Post\", and officially announced his candidacy on May 27, 2015. After performing poorly in the Iowa caucuses, Santorum ended his campaign on February 3, 2016, and endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio. After Rubio suspended his campaign, Santorum endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough he was raised in a nominally Catholic household, Santorum's faith began to deepen when he met his future wife, Karen. By his account, conversations with her father, Dr. Kenneth Garver, a staunch Catholic and pro-life advocate, solidified his understanding and opposition to abortion. He and his wife have since become increasingly religious. Santorum now considers himself a devout Catholic and acknowledges his faith as the source of his politics and worldview. He attends Mass almost daily and organized a Catholic study group for lawmakers while in Congress.\n\nSantorum proudly calls himself a \"culture warrior\" and \"true Christian conservative\". In so positioning himself, he has garnered popularity among evangelicals, but his support among Catholics is not as robust. Santorum's emphasis on his \"Christian roots\" was especially favored by evangelicals in the Midwest and Southern states during the 2012 primaries, although he lost the Republican Catholic vote in most states to Romney. Exit polls found only 42% of those Catholics and less than a third of Protestant evangelicals knew Santorum was Catholic. After Santorum won Protestant-majority states Alabama and Mississippi, but lost in heavily Catholic Puerto Rico, \"The Huffington Post\" said he \"seemed exasperated by the trend\" and said his base support came from \"people who take their faith seriously\", not necessarily fellow Catholics.\n\nSantorum has written for Catholic publications and frequently comments on political issues from a religious standpoint. He has said, \"I don't believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute. The First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means bringing people and their faith into the public square.\" In an interview with the \"National Catholic Reporter\", Santorum said that the distinction between private religious conviction and public responsibility, espoused by President John F. Kennedy, had caused \"great harm in America\". He said: \"All of us have heard people say, 'I privately am against abortion, homosexual marriage, stem cell research, cloning. But who am I to decide that it's not right for somebody else?' It sounds good, but it is the corruption of freedom of conscience.\" He told a group of college students in 2008 that the United States had been founded on \"Judeo-Christian\" ethics, and now \"it is a shambles, it is gone from the world of Christianity as I see it.\"\n\nSantorum has said he values faith over politics and considers politicians' faith significant. He questioned whether Barack Obama truly has a religion, alleging that he may have chosen Christianity as a politically expedient platform for power. Santorum stated, \"if the President says he's a Christian, he's a Christian\", but has stated that Obama's agenda is based on a \"phony theology\", not the Bible. In an interview with Glenn Beck, Santorum said Obama's desire for greater higher education rates nationwide was a veiled attempt at \"indoctrination\", saying that \"62 percent of kids who go into college with a faith commitment leave without it.\" Santorum declined to provide a source for that figure. He believes colleges reinforce secular relativism and antagonize religiosity, particularly Christianity, and lists young people's support for abortion, gay marriage, and pornography as \"symptoms\" of indoctrination.\n\nIn reaction to Pope Francis's encyclical \"Laudato si'\", which acknowledges man-made climate change and calls for swift and unified global policies to phase out fossil fuels, Santorum said in 2015: \"The church has gotten it wrong a few times on science, and I think we probably are better off leaving science to the scientists and focusing on what we’re good at, which is theology and morality.\"\n\nSantorum has consistently held socially conservative views and has advocated \"compassionate conservatism\". He has a more mixed record on fiscal issues. As a member of Congress, he voted for the Bush tax cuts, favored a balanced budget amendment and sought to curb entitlements, playing a key role in enacting welfare reform. He has been criticized for supporting costly federal programs in education and transportation and for using earmarks to fund Pennsylvania projects. He says he regrets many of his votes for such programs, and opposes earmarks. He has also specifically disavowed his 2003 support for the unfunded Medicare prescription drug benefit and his vote for the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\nIn 2003, he was described by the \"Pennsylvania Report\" as having a \"confrontational, partisan, 'in your face' style of politics and government.\" \"I just don’t take the pledge. I take the bullets,\" Santorum said. \"I stand out in front and I lead to make sure the voices of those who do not have a voice are out in front and being included in the national debate.\"\n\nSantorum considered himself pro-choice on abortion throughout his early life, but adopted a pro-life position by 1990 when he ran for Congress. He has become known for his staunch opposition to abortion. In 2015, he said, \"'I do not \"believe\" life begins at conception. I \"know\" life begins at conception. This is not a matter of debate. It's not a matter of faith... Every child at the moment of conception is both living — that embryo is metabolizing — and it is...genetically completely human\"'. During a 2016 presidential debate, Santorum said, \"'Twice in my life we were counseled to have an abortion — once with our son Gabriel and one with our little girl, Bella... Neither time did Karen (Santorum's wife) and I even think about [an abortion], because we know life begins at conception'\".\n\nIn 1996, Santorum led the unsuccessful attempt to override President Bill Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995, He also sponsored a similar bill in 1999. Santorum was a lead sponsor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush in November 2003 and upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the 2007 decision \"Gonzales v. Carhart\".\n\nSantorum has condemned the term \"middle class\" as “Marxism talk” used by liberals, maintaining that the United States has no social classes. At an August 2013 GOP fundraiser in Rock Rapids, Iowa, he said, “Don’t use the term the other side uses. ... The middle class. ... Since when in America do we have classes? Since when in America are people stuck in areas or defined places called a class? That’s Marxism talk. ... When Republicans get up and talk about middle class, we’re buying into their rhetoric of dividing America. Stop it. There’s no class in America. Call them on it.”\n\nSantorum has said he does not believe a \"right to privacy\" is part of the Constitution. He has criticized the Supreme Court decision in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965), which held that the Constitution guaranteed that right and overturned a law prohibiting the sale of contraceptives to married couples. Santorum has asserted that the right to privacy set forth in \"Griswold\" was a \"jurisprudential novelty [that] quickly become a constitutional wrecking ball\" and eventually led the Court to recognize a constitutional right to abortion in \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973). In critiquing \"Griswold\", Santorum emphasized that he did not support laws banning contraceptives. Santorum has, however, described contraception as \"a license to do things in [the] sexual realm that [are] counter to how things are supposed to be.\"\n\nIn March 2005, Santorum expressed misgivings about the death penalty in light of wrongly convicted individuals who were sentenced to death. He went on to say, \"I agree with the Pope that in the civilized world ... the application of the death penalty should be limited. I would definitely agree with that. I would certainly suggest there probably should be some further limits on what we use it for.\" In January 2012, Santorum said, \"when there is certainty, that's the case that capital punishment can be used\", but \"if there is not certainty, under the law, it shouldn't be used.\"\n\nSantorum used cannabis in college, but later said, \"Even during that time, I knew that what I was doing was wrong.\" He is against the legalization of cannabis, and believes that the federal law against it should be enforced in Colorado. He has voted in favor of increasing penalties for drug trafficking and possession, and for increased spending on drug control.\n\nSantorum rejects the scientific opinion on climate change that stresses human causation for global warming, calling it \"junk science\". He has said that global warming is a \"beautifully concocted scheme\" by the political left and \"an excuse for more government control of your life.\" He has also rebuked Pope Francis for his opinions on climate change, saying Francis should \"leave science to the scientists\".\n\nHe has stated a policy of \"drill everywhere\" for oil and that there is \"enough oil, coal and natural gas to last for centuries\".\n\nIn 2012, Santorum said that half of all euthanizations in the Netherlands are involuntary, that Dutch hospitals euthanize elderly patients for financial reasons, and that 10% of all deaths in the Netherlands are the result of such involuntary euthanizations. Santorum's claims were called \"bogus\" by both \"The Washington Post\" fact-checker Glenn Kessler and FactCheck.org, which noted that no evidence supported the claims. Santorum's comments caused a significant backlash in the Netherlands.\n\nAs U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, in each year from 1992 through 1994, Santorum received a grade of B, and as U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, Santorum received grades of A from 1995 through 1997, B+ in 1998 and 1999, B in 2000, A from 2001 through 2004, B in 2005, and B+ in 2006 from the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative taxpayers advocacy organization.\n\nSantorum, who received nearly $116,000 from the gun lobby from 1990 to 2017, has consistently supported gun rights. Santorum is an advocate of the right to bear arms. He is also a defender of gun manufacturers, and voted for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (Bill S 397), which prevents civil suits from being brought against gun manufacturers for criminal acts perpetrated with their weapons. On March 25, 2018, in response to the \"March for Our Lives\", Santorum told CNN that rather than marching the students should \"take CPR classes\" instead of \"looking to someone else to solve their problems.\" Columbia Journalism Review called the comment \"asinine on its face,\" but said that, even so, the response from doctors, journalists and students about the \"stupid\" comment was excessive.\n\nIn 2015, Santorum called for more restrictions on family-based immigration after warning of a \"flood of legal—not illegal—immigrants to our country\", which he blamed for depressing the median income of American workers.\n\nIn 2006, Santorum opposed the Senate's immigration reform proposal, saying the U.S. should simply act to enforce currently existing laws. He has openly stated his opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants. He supports the construction of a barrier along the U.S.–Mexican border, an increase in the number of border patrol agents, and the stationing of National Guard troops along the border. He also believes that illegal immigrants should be deported immediately when they commit crimes, and that undocumented immigrants should not receive benefits from the government. He believes English should be established as the national language in the United States. Santorum cites his own family's history (his father immigrated to the U.S. from Italy) as proof of how to immigrate \"the right way\".\n\nAt the 2015 Iowa Freedom Summit, Santorum said the volume of legal immigration into the United States is also too high, and stated that the number of immigrants lawfully entering the country was \"affecting American workers\" by taking jobs and lowering wages. Santorum claimed that all \"net new jobs\" created in the United States economy since 2000 have gone to immigrants (both legal and illegal). At the Iowa Freedom Summit, Santorum said: \"We need an immigration policy that puts American workers first.\"\n\nIn his 2005 book \"It Takes a Family\", Santorum advocated a society oriented toward \"family values\" and centered on monogamous, heterosexual relationships, marriage, and child-raising. He opposes same-sex marriage, saying the American public and their elected officials should decide on these \"incredibly important moral issues\" rather than the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring a 2003 interview, Santorum expressed opposition to same-sex marriage, said he favors having laws against polygamy, sodomy, and other actions \"antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family\", and likened homosexuality to bestiality. The remarks drew a retaliatory response from sex advice columnist and gay rights activist Dan Savage, who launched a contest to coin a \"santorum\" neologism among his blog's readers. Since 2004, the website Savage set up for the campaign has regularly been among the top search results for Santorum's surname, leading to what commentators have dubbed \"Santorum's Google problem\". Santorum has characterized the campaign as a \"type of vulgarity\" that was spread on the Internet. In September 2011, Santorum unsuccessfully requested that Google remove the content from its search engine index. In 2015, during an interview on the Rachel Maddow Show, he expressed regret for making the \"man-on-dog\" statement, which he described as \"flippant,\" but added: \"[T]he substance of what I said ... I stand by that.\" In the same appearance, Santorum argued that Congress could reverse the Supreme Court's decision simply by passing a law declaring the decision to be erroneous and overriding it.\n\nIn 2011, during his bid for the Republican nomination in the upcoming presidential election, Santorum attended a Republican primary debate held two days after the official end of the Clinton-era Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy that effectively banned homosexuals from open service in the United States Armed Forces, and fielded a question from Stephen Snyder-Hill, a gay soldier then serving in Iraq, about the progress made by gay and lesbian soldiers in the military. The soldier was booed by some in the audience, and Santorum said his administration would reinstate the ban on gays in the military. Santorum was roundly criticized for not supporting the soldier, and he later asserted he had not heard the booing from the stage.\n\nIn 2015, Santorum signed an online pledge vowing not to respect any law, including any decision by the United States Supreme Court, conferring legal recognition on same-sex marriage. The pledge states, in part: \"A decision purporting to redefine marriage flies in the face of the Constitution and is contrary to the natural created order. As people of faith we pledge obedience to our Creator when the State directly conflicts with higher law.\" In April 2015, Santorum stated on Hugh Hewitt's radio program that he would not attend a same-sex wedding, saying: \"as a person of my faith, that would be something that would be a violation of my faith.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Santorum made a statement that was seen as supportive of Caitlyn Jenner. At a Republican convention in South Carolina, in response to a question about Jenner, Santorum said: \"if [Jenner] says he's a woman, then he's a woman. My responsibility as a human being is to love and accept everybody. Not to criticize people for who they are.\" Because of Santorum's consistent opposition to same-sex marriage, his apparent acceptance of Jenner's transition was considered surprising. At the same time, however, some people criticized Santorum for continuing to use the male pronoun in reference to Jenner. Santorum declined to take a position on whether transgender people should be allowed to use restrooms of the gender of their choice, saying only that he believed the federal government should leave the issue to local authorities. Santorum later \"clarified\" his statement, writing that he \"meant to express empathy\", and \"not a change in public policy.\" In July 2015, Santorum reaffirmed his support for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, contending that \"... we need a national standard for marriage.\"\n\nIn June 2011, Santorum said he would continue to \"fight very strongly against libertarian influence within the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\" In an interview with NPR in the summer of 2005, Santorum discussed what he called the \"libertarianish right\", saying \"they have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever they want to do. Government should keep our taxes down and keep our regulation low and that we shouldn't get involved in the bedroom, we shouldn't get involved in cultural issues, you know, people should do whatever they want. Well, that is not how traditional conservatives view the world, and I think most conservatives understand that individuals can't go it alone...\"\n\nDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Santorum came out in support of an increase in the federal minimum wage. In September 2015, he said, \"'Republicans are losing elections because we aren’t taking about [workers], all we want to talk about is what happened to business, there are people that work in those businesses.'\"\n\nOn his official website, Santorum said that the \"Obama Administration has turned a blind eye\" to pornography, but promised that that \"will change under a Santorum Administration.\" According to \"USA Today\", some conservatives believe Santorum's opposition to pornography could \"hurt the party politically.\" On March 23, 2012, Santorum wrote on his campaign website that there is \"a wealth of research\" demonstrating that pornography causes \"profound brain changes\" and widespread negative effects on children and adults, including \"violence to women.\" Researchers say that there is no such evidence of brain changes, although pornography's harmfulness \"is still in dispute.\" James Poulos, a writer for \"Forbes\", wrote on March 19, 2012, that Santorum's criticism of pornography is an \"ability to transform relatively irrelevant issues into politically relevant controversies.\"\n\nSantorum defended his assertions by saying that \"the Obama Department of Justice seems to favor pornographers over children and families\", and that the department's failure to prosecute the porn industry \"proves his point.\" He then said that Obama has not put a priority on tackling the porn industry, \"putting children at risk as a result of that.\" In a position paper circulated in March 2012, Santorum said he would order his attorney general to \"vigorously enforce\" existing laws that \"prohibit distribution of hardcore (obscene) pornography on the Internet, on cable/satellite TV, on hotel/motel TV, in retail shops and through the mail or by common carrier.\"\n\nWhile in Congress, Santorum supported efforts to fight global HIV/AIDS, provide assistance to orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries, combat genocide in Sudan, and offer third world debt relief. In 2006, rock musician and humanitarian Bono said of Santorum, \"he has been a defender of the most vulnerable.\" On the domestic front, Santorum supported home ownership tax credits, savings accounts for children, rewarding savings by low-income families, funding autism research, fighting tuberculosis, and providing housing for people with HIV/AIDS. He supported increased funding for Social Services Block Grants and organizations like Healthy Start and the Children's Aid Society, and financing community health centers.\n\nSantorum supported partial privatization of Social Security, and following President Bush's reelection, he held forums across Pennsylvania on the topic.\n\nThe Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies identified Santorum, during his U.S. Senate tenure, as having a mostly pro-free trade and mostly anti-subsidies voting record.\n\nSantorum met his future wife, Karen Garver (born 1960), while she was a neo-natal nurse studying law at the University of Pittsburgh and he was recruiting summer interns for Kirkpatrick & Lockhart. They married in 1990 and have seven living children.\n\nIn 1996, the Santorums' son Gabriel was born prematurely after 20 weeks of pregnancy and died in the hospital two hours later. Karen wrote that she and Rick slept with Gabriel's body between them in the hospital that night and brought his body home the following day so that their other children could see him. The Santorums' four eldest children appeared with their parents on \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" in January 2012. Elizabeth, who was five at the time of Gabriel's death, said she was glad to have seen him, and that he holds a place in her heart.\n\nIn 2008, Karen Garver Santorum gave birth to their eighth child, Isabella, who was diagnosed with Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18), a serious genetic disorder, with only a 10% chance of survival past one year old. Following her second hospitalization in a few months, Santorum officially suspended his campaign for the 2012 United States presidential election.\n\nSantorum traveled, in 2002, to Rome to speak at a centenary celebration of the birth of Saint Josemaría Escrivá, founder of Opus Dei. He and his wife were invested as Knight and Dame of Magistral Grace of the Knights of Malta in a ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York on November 12, 2004.\n\nSantorum's net worth has been estimated between $880,000 and $3 million, which is mainly held as five rental properties around Penn State University, two personal homes in Great Falls and Penn Hills, and some IRAs. In 1997, Santorum purchased a three-bedroom house in the Pittsburgh suburb of Penn Hills. In 2001, he bought a $640,000 house in Leesburg, Virginia, sold it in 2007 for $850,000, and purchased a $2 million home in Great Falls, Virginia.\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", Santorum has paid $50,000 per year out of pocket for medical expenses not covered by insurance for his daughter Isabella. The Santorums once paid $25,000 to have Isabella airlifted from a Virginia hospital to a children's hospital in Philadelphia.\n\nIn his free time, Santorum is an avid fantasy baseball player.\n\nSantorum has written four books: \"It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good\" (2005); \"American Patriots: Answering the Call to Freedom\" (2012); \"Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works\" (2014); and \"Bella's Gift: How One Little Girl Transformed Our Family and Inspired a Nation\" (2015). In addition to Santorum's books, a collection of his speeches as a U.S. senator was published and released by Monument Press in 2005 under the title \"Rick Santorum: A Senator Speaks Out on Life, Freedom, and Responsibility\".\n\nSantorum also wrote a foreword to William A. Dembski's 2006 \"Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson and the Intelligent Design Movement\" and a 2006 autobiography.\n\nIn \"It Takes a Family\", Santorum argues that the traditional family is the foundation of society. Santorum criticizes alike laissez-faire conservatives and liberal proponents of social welfare for promoting a radical view of autonomy. In particular, he criticizes the \"bigs\" – \"big government, big media, big entertainment, big universities.\" The book became a \"New York Times\" bestseller.\n\n\"American Patriots\" tells the stories of 25 lesser-known Americans from the American Revolution. Santorum writes, \"Most Americans know something about our Founding Fathers and their role in creating the government of the United States. However, most know little about the day-to-day battles fought by Americans of all backgrounds that paved the way for the high ideals of our founders to be put into practice.\" He also writes, \"Today we are facing a threat to the very foundation our founders laid. That threat does not come from an alien force but from those who are willing and determined to abandon the concept of God-given rights. Like the royalty during the Revolution, today's elites wish to return to the pre-Revolutionary paradigm in which they, through governmental force, allocate rights and responsibilities.\" \n\n\"Blue Collar Conservatives\" departs from traditional Republican orthodoxy and says that the Republican Party must to appeal to blue collar Americans. He says, \"As many as six million blue collar voters stayed home from the polls, and there's good reason to believe that a large majority of them would have voted Republican if they had voted.\" Santorum puts forward a recipe for Republican success in which Republicans advocate for workers and not just corporations. He says that many middle class workers who have been forced into part-time jobs at big box stores or even into public assistance programs are amenable to the GOP's message if it is presented in relatable terms. He tackles education, saying the current system of government-run schools is a \"relic of the late 19th century\" and that children should not be pressured into going to college when a job or vocational training would be a better option. He criticizes libertarian influence in the Republican Party, saying, \"There are some in my party who have taken the ideal of individualism to such an extreme that they have forgotten the obligation to look out for our fellow man.\" He says the GOP should be less quick to dismiss concerns over decreasing social and economic mobility, saying that large businesses and stocks are strong, while life has become \"a trickle\" for workers. He questions rich compensation of business executives, and says that while he supports free trade, Republicans need to look at its impact on the average person and consider whether existing laws are fair.\n\nIn January 2015, Santorum announced \"Bella's Gift: How One Little Girl Transformed Our Family and Inspired a Nation\", a book about his daughter Bella, who lives with a rare genetic condition called Trisomy 18. The book is authored by Santorum and his wife, Karen Santorum, and co-authored by their daughter, Elizabeth Santorum. It was released February 10, 2015.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11463455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11463455", "title": "Robert Farquharson", "text": "Robert Farquharson\n\nRobert Donald William Farquharson (born 1969) is an Australian man charged, tried and convicted of murdering his three sons on Father's Day in 2005 by driving them in his car into a farm dam.\n\nFarquharson was convicted in an earlier trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term. However, he maintained his innocence and appealed his sentence. On 17 December 2009, he won the right to a retrial, due in part to the key witness for the prosecution, Greg King, facing potential criminal charges himself at the time of the original trial. He was released on bail on 21 December, but was again convicted of murder on 22 July 2010.\n\nHelen Garner published \"This House of Grief\" (2014) as a response to the crime and the ensuing trials, in which Faruqharson is heavily depicted. \n\nFarquharson met Cindy Gambino, in February 1990 and the two began a relationship. Gambino had previously been in a relationship with a man who was killed in a car accident. In 1996, Farquharson took a redundancy package from his employer and bought a lawn-mowing franchise servicing his local area, a venture which lost him AU$40,000.\n\nFarquharson married Gambino in 2000 and they had three children by 2002. The pair separated amicably in 2004. Farquharson suffered from avoidant personality disorder and bouts of depression, and sought the assistance of a psychologist and later a psychiatrist to deal with the separation. He was prescribed the antidepressants Zoloft and later Avanza.\n\nAbout 7 pm on 4 September 2005, as Farquharson was returning his children to their mother after a Father's Day access visit, his white 1989 VN Commodore vehicle veered across the Princes Highway between Winchelsea and Geelong, in Victoria, crashed through a fence and came to rest in a farm dam where it filled with water and submerged. His three children, Jai (10), Tyler (7) and Bailey (2), were unable to free themselves and drowned. Farquharson managed to escape and alerted another driver who took him to nearby Winchelsea. Police divers recovered the boys' bodies about 2 am the next day. They were still inside the vehicle and unrestrained by seatbelts. \n\nAfter a three-month investigation, police prepared murder charges against Farquharson and went to his Winchelsea home on 14 December 2005. He was not there at the time but presented himself at the Geelong police station in the presence of his lawyer. He was arrested and charged with three counts of murder. He had previously requested and undertook a lie detector test, the results of which are inadmissible in court. He later appeared in the Geelong Magistrates Court, where he was remanded in custody and ordered to appear before the court on 7 April 2006.\n\nGambino told the court that she did not believe Farquharson intended to kill their children deliberately, saying \"I believe with all my heart that this was just an accident and that he would not have hurt a hair on their heads. I don't believe this is murder.\"\n\nPolice alleged that Farquharson was in control of the vehicle in the moments before it crashed into the dam and that he earlier told a friend, Greg King, that he had intended to kill his children to get back at his wife. He was later granted bail and released from custody to appear at his trial which was scheduled to begin in August 2007.\n\nFarquharson's trial for the murder of his sons began in the Supreme Court of Victoria, before Justice Philip Cummins, on 21 August 2007. A total of 49 witnesses appeared during the six-week trial.\n\nSergeant Glen Urquhart gave evidence that the steering wheel of Farquharson's vehicle would require a 220-degree turn to veer as it did on the highway to leave the road. There was no evidence of braking before the car entered the dam. The vehicle's headlights, heater and ignition system were all in the off position. \n\nThe body of the oldest child, Jai, was found protruding halfway out of the vehicle's front door. The other boys were discovered in the back seat. \n\nPolice video re-enactments of the crime scene played before the court showed the car veering left, instead of right, towards the dam at the exact position on the highway the accident happened. Farquharson's car was found to pull slightly to the right, though not to the degree that would counteract the left-veering force according to Urquhart.\n\nKing, a bus driver, testified that he recalled a conversation with Farquharson two months before the incident outside a fish and chip shop. He said his friend spoke of seeking revenge on his former wife and of wanting to \"take away the things that mean the most to her\", meaning the children. King recalled Farquharson complaining how his wife had taken the newer of the two cars. But King's wife could not recall her husband relaying this conversation to her that day.\n\nAnother witness, Shane Atkinson, who discovered Farquharson on the side of the road, said Farquharson twice refused to call the 000 emergency number, preferring instead to travel to Winchelsea to tell his wife of his children's fate. The court transcript reveals Atkinson had to borrow a mobile phone to call police from the Winchelsea police station, which was closed for the night. This backs up the evidence given originally at the committal hearing that no mobile phone was available. \n\nMatthew Naughton, an associate professor and specialist in sleep and respiratory medicine, told the jury that it was highly unlikely Farquharson had suffered a coughing fit in the moments before the accident. He further testified that coughing to the point of blacking out is an extremely rare condition, known as cough syncope, and that Farquharson was unlikely to have suffered such an attack while driving given the warmth of his vehicle. He later conceded, however, that he had never seen cough syncope, would not know how to take a history to determine it and was sceptical even of its existence, a consideration not backed up by others in the same sphere of medicine.\n\nFarquharson relied upon the defence of losing consciousness due to a coughing fit and told police that he woke up in the dam. He said that the car had begun to submerge when his son Jai tried to free himself by opening the passenger door.\n\nCam Everett, the owner of the property where the dam was located, told the court that a total of seven vehicles had crashed through his farm fence in eight years. No vehicles other than Farquharson's had ended up in the dam in that time.\n\nFormer police superintendent David Axup, who has not been a policeman for over 20 years, contradicted the prosecution's arguments about the path and steering of the car as it left the road, believing it had probably travelled on a 53-degree arc. He said this could be explained by the right camber of the road towards the dam as well as the fact that the car had poor wheel alignment, meaning it would move uncontrolled to the right.\n\nFarquharson's thoracic medicine specialist, Chris Steinfort, also concluded it was \"highly likely\" that his patient had suffered from cough syncope on the night. Steinfort has seen cases of cough syncope and believed the symptoms suffered by Farquharson were a \"classic\" example.\n\nThe day before the verdict came in, Farquharson arranged for flowers (three red tulips) to be laid at the grave of his children. Attached was a card reading \"Dear Jai, Thinking of you on your birthday. Love you, Dad.\" Jai would have turned 13 that day.\n\nAfter three days of deliberations, the jury found Farquharson guilty on 5 October 2007. Gambino broke down in court when the verdict was announced; her mother collapsed and was taken to hospital by ambulance. Justice Cummins allowed a recess of 15 minutes for the court to compose itself before proceedings resumed.\n\nOn 16 November 2007, Farquharson was sentenced to three terms of life imprisonment without parole. He then announced that he intended to appeal his convictions.\n\nOn 17 December 2009, Farquharson's conviction was unanimously overturned by the three appeal judges. They were critical of the trial judge, the prosecution and the evidence of key prosecution witness Greg King. On 21 December 2009 he was granted bail and released into the care of one of his sisters with AU$200,000 surety.\n\nThe retrial commenced on 4 May 2010 before Justice Lex Lasry QC. The jury retired to consider their verdict on 19 July 2010 after hearing 11 weeks of evidence and argument. On 22 July, after three days of deliberation, the second jury again found Farquharson guilty of murder. On 15 October 2010 he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 33-year minimum.\n\nHarpo Productions, the company of American talk show host Oprah Winfrey, is reported to have offered Gambino $1 million to appear on the programme and tell her story. Gambino told her story to Australian magazine \"Woman's Day\", saying that she did not believe Farquharson had killed their children, but has since changed her mind.\n\n"}

{"id": "1333423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1333423", "title": "Spider Jerusalem", "text": "Spider Jerusalem\n\nSpider Jerusalem is a fictional character and the protagonist of the comic book \"Transmetropolitan\", created by writer Warren Ellis and artist Darick Robertson, introduced under the now-defunct Helix imprint of DC Comics before being moved to the Vertigo imprint. \n\nHe is a sarcastic, drug-addicted, foul-mouthed, troubled, bitter, but brilliant gonzo journalist with a deep-seated hatred of authority, political corruption, and dogs. Spider is almost always drawn wearing a set of stereoscopic sunglasses with one lens red and the other green, and he is most often compared to the real-life figure Hunter S. Thompson.\n\nIGN named him 45th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.\n\nSpider is a renegade gonzo journalist forced to return to The City after having exhausted a substantial advance from a publisher without completing the books required by contract. After five years of effective retirement as a long-haired hermit in a compound in the mountains, he returns to The City to complete the books, takes up work for an urban newspaper to support his writing, and finds himself battling political corruption at the highest level.\n\nOne of Spider's most apparent character traits is his heavy drug use, which he makes no attempt to conceal. In addition to being a chain smoker and heavy drinker, Spider uses an extensive and bewildering variety of drugs ranging from mild stimulants, intellect enhancers, and mood-altering drugs to cocaine, heroin and rare, exotic, futuristic drugs. As is common in his society, Spider is resistant or immune to many forms of drug addiction, as well as lung cancer. Spider is well known for his foul language, especially when combining the word \"fuck\" with other words to make new and amusing insults. Spider is easily angered, his displays of temper ranging from mild verbal outbursts to violent physical assault. However, despite his temper and contempt for the City as a whole, Spider is often seen to treat innocents (particularly children) with kindness and care. \n\nSpider's past is not well known, though characters like Mitchell Royce and Spider himself have referred to past memorable incidents such as the \"enfant terrible\" (a French child assassin from the Anglo/Franco war) and the Prague telephone incident (in which Spider caused six politicians to commit suicide using just a phone). There are also hints at his childhood, which seems to have been extremely turbulent - somewhere between a victim of urban blight and a child soldier - and his early ambitions—\"I wanted to be a sniper when I grew up. Didn't everyone?\" - as well as his parents' growing madness.\n\nHe claims to have worked as a prostitute at some point in the past, and as a stripper at 8 years old. He grew up on the City's docks with drunken parents as an only child. His father drove a city bus and his mother was a housewife who cooked lizards for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. He returned to the docks as an adult to see that everyone was gone and the docks were abandoned and vowed to never forget his childhood there.\n\nSpider is a firm believer in the truth and delivering it to his readers in the most direct and blunt manner possible, often capitalising it as \"The Truth\" in his writing for emphasis. This is most notable in one story, when Spider's editor recounts the tale of how Spider submitted an article on the election of the Richard Nixon-analogue \"The Beast\", which consisted of the word \"fuck\" repeated eight thousand times (see \"Transmetropolitan #1\"). His approach to journalism has been encapsulated by Spider as \"The truth...no matter what,\" and his appraisal of others rises if they feel the same way.\n\nThe primary focus of conflict within Spider's psyche, over the course of the series, is a combination of concern for his delivery of 'The Truth' and misanthropy towards his public. Spider hates and struggles against authority figures who oppress others, but he is also bitter toward the uninvolved public who give the authority its power. Likewise, he struggles to convince the public to listen to The Truth, but is disgusted by those who blindly accept what he reports. In addition, Spider's talents earn him unwanted fame and adoration, which clouds his ability to \"get at The Truth\", often resulting in him experiencing writer's block and depression. His editor, Mitchell Royce, opines that Spider needs to be hated in order to function as a writer and journalist.\n\nDespite his absolute disdain for those around him, Spider is quite loyal to those few who he considers friends and is equally quick to hurt those who would betray him. Indeed, much of Spider's motivation in the second half of the series was dedicated to bringing the President to justice for ordering the murder of Vita Severn, whom Spider had befriended.\n\nAlthough he opposed The Beast, Spider is not loyal to any political party or organization, and his initial support of The Smiler was tinged with contempt at his cynical attitude and false altruism. He is also an avowed, often virulent atheist who opposes all organized religion, which he sees as little more than unworthy authority figures that exploit their members.\n\nHe proudly claims to be \"always armed\", and is shown with several firearms, at least one of which, called \"The Upper Hand\", can blow up a vehicle. He has also possessed a rocket launcher, which he used to blow up a bar at the base of his mountain home. He was accidentally given a bandolier of grenades at a party, which he took as a sign that \"There is a God\".\n\nSpider's weapon of choice for most of the series is a \"bowel disruptor,\" which causes instant and painful loss of bowel control, with settings that allow him to vary the level of pain and discomfort, ranging from simple loose, watery diarrhea to complete rectal prolapse. Most of the time the victim has a bowel movement so dramatic and agonizing that it induces unconsciousness. At least three times it is revealed through dialogue that the gun can be set to 'Fatal Intestinal Maelstrom'. Spider prefers this weapon because, despite being illegal, it is (usually) non-lethal and its effects are untraceable. His assistants, Channon and Yelena, have also been armed with bowel disruptors during \"The Cure\" arc. \n\nOn a few occasions, he has been known to carry lethal firearms, though according to Spider, he only carries such weapons in emergency cases. He has, in at least one case, used a handgun to kill two would-be assassins (a third was beaten to death). In issue #38, he is revealed to be a competent gunfighter, having learned his skills in \"places you never want to go.\" It is also revealed in issue #38 that he has killed sixteen people, all but one in self-defence; he never specifies how or why (although it could be inferred that he means Vita Severn, as Spider feels responsible for her death).\n\nRegardless of whether or not he is armed, Spider is shown to be a surprisingly capable, though not invincible, fighter. He frequently lashes out violently at those who threaten or aggravate him, and his ferocity often allows him to defeat opponents who are well-trained or much more imposing physically. He is also not averse to brutalizing people in order to get crucial information (as is shown in his Year Five assault on Fred Christ). Like Channon, he had also gained experience in firearms while in school, though unlike Channon, he and his classmates had had to \"make\" their own arms—to prevent the teachers having an unfair advantage. He often uses improvised weapons to gain the upper hand - for example, putting his cigarette out in the eye of a guard or beating Fred Christ with a broken chair leg, which he dubbed \"The Chair Leg of Truth\".\n\nInitially, Spider is shown with a huge amount of muddy brown, shaggy hair and a long unkempt beard, claiming he has hair in places that his once and future editor/friend Mitchell Royce doesn't even know he owns. On his return to the City, nearly all his hair is removed by a malfunctioning cleaning unit in his first apartment's bathroom. For the rest of the series, he is portrayed as virtually hairless, the exception being his eyebrows and a small amount of pubic hair. Spider is a small, slight figure with a long nose and slightly crooked teeth. His body is covered with black tattoos, combining geometric tribal designs and other more Western images (his right buttock is marked \"kiss here\"), including a small spider on his upper forehead. He is also said to have a tattoo on his penis, though this is never shown.\n\nAlthough he prefers not to wear clothes much of the time, when in public his primary mode of dress is typically a \"black linen suit, urban weight, generous cut\" (jacket and pants, no shirt under the jacket) with a pair of heavy black leather boots, although during the winter he is sometimes seen wearing a black jumper under his jacket; also, on the rare occasions when modesty is required of him he will wear knee-length boxer shorts. He also wears a pair of 'live-shades', sunglasses with built-in still-photography capabilities; the right lens is green and rectangular, whilst the left one is red and circular (the AI that created them was on drugs at the time). The first pair he owns have gold rims around the lenses, while the ones he obtains during the second part of the \"Dirge\" arc have no rims. This appearance, and the comic's futuristic setting, has made Spider Jerusalem a cult (albeit fictional) character among rivet heads, in a similar manner to Tank Girl.\n\nSpider Jerusalem is reminiscent of previous \"muck-raking\" or \"Gonzo\" journalists such as H. L. Mencken and Hunter S. Thompson. \n\nHunter S. Thompson is perhaps the most obvious inspiration for the character of Spider Jerusalem, and the fictional reporter's fondness for weaponry and spectacular consumption of drugs both indicate a resemblance toward the American gonzo journalist. (In Transmetropolitan #13, page 5, a book by Thompson is clearly visible amongst the objects strewn across the table in Spider's apartment. A book entitled \"FEAR AND LOATHING\" is also visible in Issue #1, Page 1, Panel 3, in the lower left-hand corner of the panel.)\n\nVisually, Spider Jerusalem is based on Darick Robertson's friend Andre Ricciardi.\n\nOne of Ellis' other titles, \"Planetary\", features a character in its seventh issue named Jack Carter, who is a thinly-veiled pastiche of John Constantine, being essentially identical in appearance, role, abilities and diction. The issue is essentially a retrospective commentary on the genre of grim, British-penned comics of the anti-Thatcherite 1980s milieu, of which the Carter character is positioned as the apotheosis. Having faked his own death, Carter reappears in a dramatically altered form with a shaved head and long black coat which he later opens to reveal a bare chest featuring identical tattoos to Spider Jerusalem. Lacking only the spider tattoo on the head and the trademark shades, this former Constantine-cipher has become the spitting image of Jerusalem and departs with the words: \"The Eighties are long over. Time to Move on. Time to be someone else.\"\n\n\"Wizard\" magazine ranked Spider Jerusalem as the 38th greatest comic book character of all time. Spider Jerusalem was also ranked as the 12th greatest comic book character of all time by \"Empire\" magazine quoting that \"Spider is a true one-off, a character so fearless and vibrant and nonchalantly cool that Patrick Stewart is his biggest fan. And if that's not a recommendation, we don't know what is.\" IGN also ranked Spider Jerusalem as the 45th greatest comic book hero of all time stating that Spider Jerusalem isn't quite a role model for the kids but over the course of the series' long life, readers came to know the true Spider Jerusalem and revel in his ultimate victory.\n"}

Hunziker was first employed by Swiss Natural Gas (\"Schweizerischen Gaswerke\") and the Eidgenössische Bank, before becoming the business editor and subsequently business and publishing director of the Berner Tagblatt.\n\nIn March 1936, Hunziker was hired to be secretary of the Swiss Tourist Association and, on 23 Oct 1937, appointed its director. In 1941, Hunziker initiated graduate studies in tourism at the University of St. Gallen. Hunziker founded a Tourism Research Institute at the University of St. Gallen in conjunction with that founded by Kurt Krapf at the University of Berne. The Institute is now known as the Institut für Öffentliche Dienstleistungen und Tourismus (Institute for Public Service and Tourism). In 1942, Hunziker collaborated with Krapf (director of the Bern Research Institute of Tourism) to publish the \"Outline of the General Teaching of Tourism\" (\"Grundriss der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre\"), which became the standard work for basic research in tourism. As part of this text, Hunziker and Krapf developed one of the first broadly accepted definitions of \"tourism\" (\"Fremdenverkehr\"), roughly translated as \"Tourism is the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.\" A year later Hunziker published a book on the system of \"scientific tourism research\" (\"System und Hauptprobleme einer wissenschaftlichen Fremdenverkehrslehre\") in which he tried to establish a \"completely new discipline\" as a branch of sociology; however, the attempt failed. But Hunziker and Krapf continued to examine tourism not only from an economic perspective, but also from a sociological one. Hunziker did not want tourism to have a negative impact on the cultural values of either the destination or the tourist. In 1972, Dr. Hunziker defined the essential elements of tourism science as: \n\nHunziker was an early advocate of the need to apply interdisciplinary scientific analysis to understand the highly diverse nature of tourism, develop a coherent tourism pedagogy, and use that analytical framework and training to resolve problems associated with business management and economic policy. Although Hunziker was an economist by training, he rejected the earlier view of tourism research as a subset solely of economics. Instead, Hunziker viewed tourism more as a cultural phenomenon. As such, he expanded tourism research to integrate aspects of sociology, psychology, history, geography, marketing and law as well as an understanding of how medicine and technology impacts tourism.\n\nIn May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism (Austria), Dr. Hunziker proposed the following definition: “Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services”. He viewed tourism as adding value to society by increasing understanding of other cultures and thereby reducing xenophobia and isolationism. For these reasons (rather than looking solely at economics), Dr. Hunziker opined that governments should support and encourage social tourism.\n\nAs a pragmatic implementation of social tourism, Walter Hunziker co-developed the concept of the Swiss travel savings fund (\"Schweizerische Reisekasse\" or Reka), which helps low income families enjoy vacations. Hunziker was president of REKA, 1939-1974.\n\nIn 1951, Drs. Hunziker and Krapf founded the Association Internationale d'Experts Scientifiques du Tourisme (AIEST) in order to re-connect tourism researchers after World War II. In 1962, Hunziker and Frédéric Tissot co-founded the Institut International de Glion. Professor Hunziker was the founding president of the International Organisation of Social Tourism and ran the organization from 1963 until his death in 1974. Consistent with Dr. Hunziker's focus on social tourism, the aim of the OITS is to facilitate \"the development of social tourism in the international framework. To this end it is in charge of coordinating the tourist activities of its members, as well as informing them on all matters concerning social tourism, as much on the cultural aspects as on the economic and social consequences.\" Further, OITS continues to promote Dr. Hunziker's interest in \"access to leisure, holidays and tourism for the greatest number of people - youth, families, seniors and disabled people\" and \"fair and sustainable tourism, ensuring profit for the host populations and respecting the natural and cultural heritage.\"\n\nDr. Walter Hunziker was also Director of the Swiss Federation of Tourism (1937-1945), professor of tourism at the University of St. Gallen (1941-1969), Executive Vice President of the Swiss Federation of Tourism (1946-1964), and a member of the Swiss Advisory Committee for Trade Policy (1946-1964).\n\nMany articles in the Zeitschrift für Fremdenverkehr (Journal of Tourism) and Jahrbuch für Fremdenverkehr (Yearbook of Tourism).\n\n"}

They lived on the east bank of the Hudson River eastward to the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nIn the 17th century, they were primarily based in what is now Dutchess County, New York, and their territory included the east bank of the Hudson along both Putnam and Westchester counties all the way to Manhattan Island to the south, the Mahican territory bounded by the Roeliff-Jansen Kill to the north, and extended east into parts of Connecticut.\n\nThey were most closely related to the Lenape, both being members of the Eastern Algonquian-speaking subgroup of the Algonquian peoples. The Lenape and Wappinger spoke using very similar Delawarean language. They are close enough that a Wappinger speaking in the Munsee Delaware tongue and a Lenape would mostly understand each other.\n\nTheir nearest allies were the Mahicans to the north, the Montauketts to the south, and the remaining New England tribes to the east. Like the Lenape, the Wappinger were not organized into cohesive tribes for most of their history; instead, they formed approximately 18 loosely associated bands.\n\nThe first contact with Europeans came in 1609, during Henry Hudson's expedition.\n\nThe total population of the Wappinger Confederacy has been estimated at about 13,200 individuals at the beginning of European contact. Their settlements included camps along the major rivers with larger villages located at the river mouths. Despite references to villages and other site types by early European explorers and settlers, few Contact period sites have been identified in southeastern New York (Funk 1976).\n\nRobert Juet, an officer on the \"Half Moon\", provides an account in his journal of some of the lower Hudson Valley Native Americans. In his entries for September 4 and 5, 1609, he states:\n\n\"This day the people of the country came aboord of us, seeming very glad of our comming, and brought greene tobacco, and gave us of it for knives and beads. They goe in deere skins loose, well dressed. They have yellow copper. They desire cloathes, and are very civill. \nThey have great store of maize or Indian wheate whereof they make good bread. The country is full of great and tall oakes. \nThis day [September 5, 1609] many of the people came aboord, some in mantles of feathers, and some in skinnes of divers sorts of good furres. Some women also came to us with hempe. They had red copper tabacco pipes and other things of copper they did wear about their neckes. At night they went on land againe, so wee rode very quite, but durst not trust them\" (Juet 1959:28).\nDavid Pieterz De Vries recorded another description of the Wappinger who resided around Fort Amsterdam:\n\"The Indians about here are tolerably stout, have black hair with a long, lock which they let hang on one side of the head. Their hair is shorn on the top of the head like a cock's comb. Their clothing is a coat of beaver skins over the body, with the fur inside in winter and outside in summer; they have, also, sometimes a bear's hide, or a coat of the skins of wild cats, or hefspanen [probably raccoon], which is an animal most as hairy as a wild cat, and is also very good to eat. They also wear coats of turkey feathers, which they know how to put together.\nTheir pride is to paint their faces strangely with red or black lead, so that they look like fiends. Some of the women are very well featured, having long countenances. Their hair hangs loose from their head; they are very foul and dirty; they sometimes paint their faces, and draw a black ring around their eyes.\"\nAs the Dutch began to settle in the area, they pressured the Connecticut Wappinger to sell their lands and seek refuge with other Algonquian-speaking tribes. The western bands, however, stood their ground amidst rising tensions.\n\nDuring Kieft's War in 1643, the remaining Wappinger bands united against the Dutch, attacking settlements throughout New Netherland. Allied with their trading partners, the powerful Mohawk, the Dutch defeated the Wappinger by 1645. The Mohawk and Dutch killed more than 1500 Wappinger in the two years of the war. This was a devastating toll for the Wappinger, whose population in 1600 was estimated at 3,000.\n\nThe Wappinger faced the Dutch again in the 1655 Peach Tree War, a three-day engagement which left an estimated 100 settlers and 60 Wappinger dead, and strained relations further between the two groups. After the war, the confederation broke apart, and many of the surviving Wappinger left their native lands for the protection of neighboring tribes.\n\nIn 1765, the remaining Wappinger in Dutchess County sued the Philipse family for control of the land but lost. In the aftermath the Philipses raised rents on European-American tenant farmers, sparking riots across the region.\n\nIn 1766 Daniel Nimham, sachem from Stockbridge, was part of a delegation that traveled to London to petition the Crown for land rights and better treatment by the colonists.\n\nNimham and some forty braves fell in the Battle of Kingsbridge fighting against the British on August 30, 1778. It proved an irrecoverable blow to the tribe.\n\nFrom that time the Wappingers ceased to have a name in history. A few scattered remnants still remained, and as late as 1811, a small band had their dwelling place on a low tract of land by the side of a brook, under a high hill, in the northern part of the town of Kent.\"\n\nMany Wappinger served in the Stockbridge Militia during the American Revolution. Following the war, most of the surviving Wappinger moved west to join the Algonquian Stockbridge-Munsee tribe in Ohio. Later they were removed to Wisconsin. Today, members of the federally recognized Stockbridge-Munsee Nation reside mostly in Wisconsin.\n\nFollowing their service on behalf of the American cause in the Revolution, loss of their leader Daniel Nimham, and subsequent irrecoverable loss of their land, the tribe became scattered. A very few were still found in Kent as late as 1811.\n\nThe Wappinger are also known as the Wappink, Wappings, Wappingers, Wappingoes, Wawpings, Pomptons, Wapings, Opings, Opines, Massaco, Menunkatuck, Naugatuck, Nochpeem, Wangunk Wappans, Wappings, Wappinghs, Wapanoos, Wappanoos, Wappinoo, Wappenos, Wappinoes, Wappinex, Wappinx, Wapingeis, Wabinga, Wabingies, Wapingoes, Wapings, Wappinges, Wapinger and Wappenger.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Wappinger\" is debated. While the present-day spelling appeared as early as 1643, countless alternate phonetic spellings were also used by early European settlers well into the late 19th century. Anthropologist Ives Goddard suggests the Munsee language-word \"wápinkw\", meaning \"opossum\", might be related. No evidence supports the folk etymology of the name coming from a word meaning \"easterner,\" as suggested by Edward Manning Ruttenber in 1906. and John Reed Swanton in 1952.\n\nOthers suggest that Wappinger is anglicized from the Dutch word \"wapendragers\", meaning \"weapon-bearers\", alluding to the warring relationship between the Dutch and the Wappinger.\n\nWhile a Wappinger Confederacy was proposed by Edward Manning Ruttenber in 1872 and James Mooney in 1910, Ives Goddard contests their view and writes that no evidence supports this idea.\n\nThe suggested bands, or sachemships of the Wappinger has been described as including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following content comes from: \"Freemasonry in the American Revolution\", Sidney Morse, 1924, and contains numerous contentions, including the introduction of Brazilian Amazonian Indians into the Hudson Valley:\nThe 1685 Dutch map of New Netherland places the Wappani tribe as one of many family tribes of the Tawakoni (Taconic) that lived in the Fishkill highlands.\n\nThe Towakoni tribe of which the Wappani belonged was a larger family of the Lenape. The Woarani family held the highlands of Pawling NY, and Nochpeem held the highlands of Kent NY, just below the Wappani highlands of Fishkill (See: Map of Nava Belgii Nieuw)\n\nIn 1805, 200 years after the stated 3000 person population General Clinton and Sullivan of the British forces destroyed 40 Indian Towns, their crops, fruit trees, and burned over 100,000 bushels of corn from Elmira to Genesse valley New York. This places the Indian Population well above 3000 considering the work force to maintain 40 stationary farming towns, and the various fields that supplied the vegetables. The Wappani as one small band of the Towakani of Southern NY, NJ and PA. may have had 3000 members living upon one mountain top region of Fishkill, however The Towakani tribe had Family tribes upon every mountain throughout the region which is completely over looked. Further the Towakani adopted their Woarani neighbors who were relocated by the Dutch Privateer sailors into Pawling to run the iron furnaces. The Woarani (pronounced Gwuarani ) originated in the Brazil/Paraguay region of South America. The Towakoni tribe of the Lenape was known for teaching healers or medicine through spirituality.\n\nPutnam County New York is known as the Stone chamber capital of the world and boasts over 300 known and intact stone chambers, massive effigies and man made lakes of the once vibrant Towakani tribes.\n\nThe Wappinger are the namesake of several areas in New York, including:\nBroadway in New York City also follows their ancient trail.\n\n"}

Inspired by the AK-47, the IDF assessed it thoroughly and began the process of designing a new automatic rifle for which the task was assigned to two groups: one led by Uziel Gal, the designer of the famous Uzi submachine gun, & Yisrael Galili (Balashnikov) together with Yakov Lior invented the Galil assault rifle which named for him. Tests were conducted from the end of the 1960s to the early 1970s led to Galili's rifle emerging as the winner, as a result Galil was adopted by the military.
