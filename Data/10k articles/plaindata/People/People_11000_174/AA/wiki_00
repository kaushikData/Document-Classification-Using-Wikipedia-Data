Temporarily serving as secretary-general of his longtime party Congress for the Republic (CPR), in 2012 he went into opposition, founding the Wafa Movement, which he leads as president.\n\nAs an activist for human rights, Ayadi spent six and a half years in prison, five and a half in the wake of the process against the left-wing movement El Amal Ettounsi in 1974. After his release from prison, Ayadi continued to be interrogated frequently, living under constant surveillance from the regime of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. On 24 July 2001, Ayadi co-founded the Congress of the Republic (CPR) and was elected its vice-president. Ayadi participated in a 32-day hunger strike against Ben Ali's regime on 18 October 2005, the protesters then formed the 18 October Coalition for Rights and Freedoms.\n\nAfter the Tunisian Revolution, he was named by his party, the Congress of the Republic (CPR), as its representative at the Higher Authority for Realisation of the Objectives of the Revolution, Political Reform and Democratic Transition In the 2011 Constituent Assembly election, Ayadi was elected to represent the district of La Manouba in the Constituent Assembly of Tunisia.\n\nAfter the election of CPR Secretary-General Moncef Marzouki as President of Tunisia, Ayadi moved up as leader of the CPR. His nomination was however disputed by some party members and the name of Tahar Hmila was shortly brought up. Finally, on 20 December 2011, the party officially named Ayadi the CPR's interim Secretary General, to be confirmed at the party's next congress, which however had to be delayed until June 2012.\n\nFollowing allegations that he had taken \"positions contrary to the principles of the party and its decisions, without consultation with the political bureau\", Ayadi on 19 April 2012 was dismissed from his official functions. Ayadi had lauded Samir Geagea's right-wing Lebanese Forces, whose Christian militia was responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in 1982. Haythem Belgacem temporarily replaced Ayadi as secretary general of the CPR.\n\nOnly a few days later, on 9 May 2012, Ayadi and a group of fellow partisans and members of the Constituent Assembly announced that they would leave the CPR and form a new party under the name of \"Wafa\" (meaning \"faithful\", used here in the sense of \"faithful to the revolution\"). On 25 July, the Wafa Movement was officially founded. \n\nIn late June 2014, Ayadi was one of the first to announce his candidacy for the 2014 presidential election. In the 2014 parliamentary election, his new party however lost all its seats. On 19 December 2014 he however withdrew.\n\nOn 25 February 2012, Ayadi declared on Tunisian TV that the first President of Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba, had been \"hostile to Arab culture and Islam\".\n\nWhen in March 2012, the preamble of the new Tunisian Constitution was discussed, Ayadi supported Ennahda's proposal to keep intact Article 1 of the 1959 constitution describing the country as a republic with Arabic being its language and Islam its religion. Ayadi said: \"As long as the identity of the country is Arab-Muslim, the article remains accurate and relevant.\" The decision could potentially prevent the abuse of religion for political gains, he said: \"Prophet Mohammed used politics for religion. Now we are afraid that some will use religion for politics – especially when the goals aren’t always clear.\"\n\nIn May 2012, he declared that he would \"respect and love\" Adolf Hitler who had never done anything against the Arabs. He claimed that the situation for Tunisia had even improved with the German invasion during the Second World War.\n\nIn January 2013, Ayadi supported the inscription of legal jihad into the Constitution of Tunisia, allegedly advocating the integration of jihadist fighters into the Tunisian Army. This information was disclaimed by Wafa party officials on the next day.\n\nAfter the murder of left-wing leader Chokri Belaid, one of Ayadi's allies during the times as activists, on 6 February 2013, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali from the Islamist Ennahda party announced on 12 February that he would form a government of \"national unity\" which would consist of \"apolitical technocrats.\" Abderraouf Ayadi's Wafa party immediately criticized this proposal and stressed that a government which remains true to the values of the revolution should remain \"political in nature.\"\n\nOn 20 November 2013 he proposed that a dialogue be started with the outlawed Islamist terror group Ansar al-Sharia.\n"}

He is also a former senior member of the ruling National Democratic Party of Egypt (NDP) .\n\nAhmed Ezz was born to Muslim parents. In 1959, Ezz graduated from Cairo University with a degree in Civil Engineering. He has been elected twice as the head of the Arab Iron and Steel Union. Prior to his work in organized labor, Ezz was a parliamentary member representing the districts of Sadat-Monouf-Sers al-Liyan in Monofuyia from the year 2000 to 2011, and also the Chairman of the Planning and Budgeting Committee of the People's Assembly of Egypt as a member of the National Democratic Party. (According to Al Jazeera, he resigned from the NDP on 29 January 2011.)\n\nPrior to the revolution, opposition parties, other parliamentarians, and groups accused Ezz of monopolizing the steel industry in Egypt by holding more than 60 percent of the market share, describing it as an act that is backed up by the government, an act that was described by the active parliamentarian Aboul Ezz Al Hariri as \"enhancing the proliferation of monopolies rather than fighting them\". The groups mentioned are even blaming him of increasing the steel prices of as much as 70 percent. In response Ezz has told reporters that a competition law \"would at least provide a legal framework preventing everyone from making accusations\".\n\nEzz companies were investigated twice for monopoly by the Egyptian Competition Authority, both before and after the January 2011 Revolution. The companies were found \"not guilty\" of any monopolistic or anti-competition actions both times. Ahmed Ezz was also prosecuted for the same charge and found not guilty by the Egyptian Economic Court in July 2013.\n\nEzz was planning on running in the 2015 Egyptian parliamentary election as an independent in the Sadat City constituency, though he lost his appeal after he was disqualified from running. Another appeal was adjourned until 22 April 2015.\n\nAfter the resignation of Hosni Mubarak due to the 2011 Egyptian revolution, on 17 February 2011 Ahmed Ezz was arrested, along with former interior minister Habib el-Adly, former minister of housing Ahmed Maghrabi and former tourism minister Zuheir Garana. News of the arrests spread quickly in the local Egyptian press. As a result, many fear that Ahmed Ezz will not receive a fair trial under a 1981 provision of Egyptian emergency law. Amr Bargisi, a senior partner with the Egyptian Union of Liberal Youth, told the\" Washington Times\" \"I am afraid the divorce of wealth from power will probably not only lead to the unfair treatment of many businessmen and former politicians, but might also take Egypt in a direction that will be devastating for the economy and the prospects of democracy. Every businessman at the moment is a suspect of the revolutionary regime and the public. If this trend continues, we will see major capital flight from Egypt.\" Joe Stork, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division, told the \"Washington Times\" of Mr. Ezz: \"Certainly he, like anyone else, has his right to a fair trial. The judicial proceedings he is subjected to should meet fair-trial standards; he should know the accusations against him; he should be able to confront those who are accusing him.\"\n\nIn an 11 March letter from prison that was published on the Bikyamas website, Mr. Ezz refuted the charges against him and warned that \"In this unprecedented time for the country, it is important to remember what our youth are calling for: freedom, fairness and democracy. My hope is that this commitment to a bright future for Egypt is not undermined at its first hurdle through a desire to find scapegoats. I truly hope I can at least depend on a full representation of the facts, due legal process and a fair trial.\"\n\nOn 5 October 2012, Ahmed Ezz was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to seven years in jail – plus a fine of 19.5bn Egyptian pounds (about $3bn; £2bn) Mr. Hammam was also fined 35 million dollars. These sentences were later appealed by Ahmed Ezz and they are currently being re-tried for this case.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27742662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27742662", "title": "André Jullien", "text": "André Jullien\n\nAndré Jullien (1766 at Chalon-sur-Saône, Saône-et-Loire – 1832 of cholera in Paris) was a French vintner and pioneering wine writer. Wine historian Hugh Johnson describes Jullien's work as \"the foundation-stone of modern writing about wine\".\n\nAt the age of around 30, Jullien moved to Paris and entered the wholesale wine trade. As a \"négociant\" he made several improvements to the practices of the wine trade; he invented an air tube to better being able to tap wine and a powder for clarification of wine. For this, he was awarded gold medals at various exhibitions and was supported by the minister Jean-Antoine Chaptal.\n\nJullien initiated the ambitious project of describing all known wine regions and their wines, and in this he made a pioneering effort, as the professional wine literature was almost solely concerned with how to grow vines and make wine, and not with describing and comparing different wine regions. This took him on many a distant journey and the result was his \"Topographie de tous les vignobles connus\", which was published in a first edition in 1816, and a second in 1822. An important feature of this work was his classification of all wines into five classes. An abridged edition translated into English was published in 1824 as \"a manual and guide to all importers and purchasers in the choice of wines\". The third and fourth French editions in 1832 incorporated many changes and were further expanded. This edition was awarded the French Academy of Sciences' statistics prize in 1832. The final two editions were signed \"corrected and augmented by C.E. Jullien\" who was likely Jullien's son.\n\nHe also published a manual for sommeliers under the title \"Manuel du sommelier\" in 1822 and the technical publication \"Appareils perfectionnés propres à transvaser les vins et autres liqueurs avec ou sans communication avec l'air extérieur\" in 1832.\n\nIn his 1816 work, \"Topographie de tous les vignobles connus\", Jullien created the most comprehensive cataloging of the world's wine region ever done up to that point. In addition to describing the well known European wine region, Jullien also described Cossack winemaking techniques used in Ekaterinoslav, wine styles of Hindu Kush and Astrakhan, and surveyed the vineyards of several islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. On the islands of Madeira, he compared the dry wines made from Sercial to the great wines of the Rhine-a description that would support the apocryphal belief that the Madeira grape descended from the German wine grape variety Riesling. In Madeira, he also described unusual aging methods employed on the island, such as the tradition of burying oak barrels of wine in a pit for 6 months underneath layers of horse manure.\n\nHis writings on Bordeaux include one of the earliest classifications of the region's estate with Haut-Brion, Margaux, Latour and Lafite listed among the finest wine of the area. Nearly 40 years later, the official 1855 classification would closely mirror Jullien's rankings including all of the first growths. Traveling with the English wine writer Cyrus Redding in Germany, Jullien described the quality of German wines produced during the comet vintage of 1811.\n"}

{"id": "1482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1482", "title": "Ask and Embla", "text": "Ask and Embla\n\nIn Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (from )—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, three gods, one of whom is Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.\n\nOld Norse literally means \"ash tree\" but the etymology of \"embla\" is uncertain, and two possibilities of the meaning of \"embla\" are generally proposed. The first meaning, \"elm tree\", is problematic, and is reached by deriving \"*Elm-la\" from \"*Almilōn\" and subsequently to (\"elm\"). The second suggestion is \"vine\", which is reached through \"*Ambilō\", which may be related to the Greek term (), itself meaning \"vine, liana\". The latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories.\n\nAccording to Benjamin Thorpe \"Grimm says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assiduous labour; the same relation as Meshia and Meshiane, the ancient Persian names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees.\"\n\nIn stanza 17 of the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Völuspá\", the völva reciting the Poem states that Hœnir, Lóðurr and Odin once found Ask and Embla on Land. The Völva says that the two were capable of very little, lacking in \"ørlög\" and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods:\n\nThe meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary.\n\nAccording to chapter 9 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", the three brothers Vili, Vé, and Odin, are the creators of the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of Midgard.\n\nA Proto-Indo-European basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of \"embla\" meaning \"vine.\" In Indo-European societies, an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and sexual intercourse. Vines were used as a flammable wood, where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood, resulting in fire. Further evidence of ritual making of fire in Scandinavia has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a Bronze Age grave in Kivik, Scania, Sweden.\n\nJaan Puhvel comments that \"ancient myths teem with trite 'first couples' of the type of Adam and his by-product Eve. In Indo-European tradition, these range from the Vedic Yama and Yamī and the Iranian Mašya and Mašyānag to the Icelandic Askr and Embla, with trees or rocks as preferred raw material, and dragon's teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure\".\n\nIn his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in Indo-European society, Anders Hultgård observes that \"myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient Europe and Indo-Europe and Indo-European-speaking peoples of Asia Minor and Iran. By contrast the cultures of the Near East show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive man's origin from clay, earth or blood by means of a divine creation act\".\n\nTwo wooden figures—the Braak Bog Figures—of \"more than human height\" were unearthed from a peat bog at Braak in Schleswig, Germany. The figures depict a nude male and a nude female. Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that these figures may represent a \"Lord and Lady\" of the Vanir, a group of Norse gods, and that \"another memory of [these wooden deities] may survive in the tradition of the creation of Ask and Embla, the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore\".\n\nA figure named Æsc (Old English \"ash tree\") appears as the son of Hengest in the Anglo-Saxon genealogy for the kings of Kent. This has resulted in a number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre-Norse Germanic mythology.\n\nConnections have been proposed between Ask and Embla and the Vandal kings Assi and Ambri, attested in Paul the Deacon's 7th century AD work \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\". There, the two ask the god Godan (Odin) for victory. The name \"Ambri\", like Embla, likely derives from \"*Ambilō\".\n\nA stanza preceding the account of the creation of Ask and Embla in \"Völuspá\" provides a catalog of dwarfs, and stanza 10 has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth. This may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans, and that the three gods gave them life. Carolyne Larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in Old Norse works (examples include \"trees of jewellery\" for women and \"trees of battle\" for men) due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees; Ask and Embla.\n\nAsk and Embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions. A sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern Swedish city of Sölvesborg, created in 1948 by Stig Blomberg. Ask and Embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the Oslo City Hall in Oslo, Norway, by Dagfin Werenskiold.\n\n\n"}

He would travel with the Circus and go to local schools when at a location for a lengthy period. One school was 'All Saints' at Blackheath, London in 1958, the heath being a popular location for the circus. The first appearance of the Billy Smart circus was on 5 April at Southall Park in Middlesex. The circus toured alongside Smart's funfair; the tents blew down and the circus carried out its performances for two days in the open air. Smart made his circus debut with \"Billy Smart's New World Circus\" as assistant ringmaster aged 12. He was soon performing with ponies and horses, but became best known later for his elephant acts. In one famous incident, he tamed a herd of performing elephants when they stampeded in the ring. At its peak, Billy Smart's four-masted Big Top could hold over 6,000 people, with a show including hundreds of animals and performers.\n\nSmart, together with his brothers, Ronald Smart and David Smart, took over management of the circus when their father died in 1966 at Ipswich. The circus ceased touring in 1971, but televised performances continued until 1983, drawing audiences of up to 22 million at its height. The Smart Brothers also developed Guernsey Zoo, selling it in 1972, and opened Windsor Safari Park in 1969 before selling it in 1977, for the equivalent of £30m in 2017 (it is now the site of Legoland Windsor).

{"id": "8288121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8288121", "title": "Brangaine", "text": "Brangaine\n\nBrangaine (variously spelled Brangaene, Brangwane, Brangien, Brangwin, etc.) is the handmaid and confidante of Iseult of Ireland in the Arthurian legend of Tristan and Iseult. She appears in most versions of the story.\n\nBrangaine plays essentially the same role in the early poetic versions of Béroul and Thomas of Britain, and their respective German successors Eilhart von Oberge and Gottfried von Strassburg. She is the inadvertent catalyst in the development of the story's central romance: before Tristan takes Iseult back to Cornwall to be the wife of his uncle Mark, Iseult's mother (also named Iseult) entrusts Brangaine with a love potion meant for Iseult and her new husband to drink on their wedding night. However, Tristan and Iseult find the potion on the boat ride to Cornwall, and mistaking it for regular wine, they drink it. So begins their unstoppable passion. Upon arrival in Cornwall, the virgin Brangaine plays a second important role: she secretly substitutes for Iseult on her wedding night to King Mark, protecting Iseult's honor. Afterwards, however, Iseult grows worried that Brangaine might reveal their secret, or develop feelings for Mark. She orders servants to take her out in the woods and kill her. The servants cannot bring themselves to do it, and instead tie the handmaid to a tree. Iseult comes to her senses, and overjoyed that Brangaine is not dead, frees her and apologizes for her actions.\n\nIn some versions Brangaine later serves as a love interest for Tristan's brother and friend Kahedin. Mark has finally discovered his wife and nephew's adultery and banishes Tristan to Brittany, where the saddened knight tries to forget his love by marrying another girl named Iseult, this one the daughter of King Hoel and sister of Kahedin. However, he cannot bring himself to consummate the marriage, which his wife eventually reveals to her brother. When questioned, Tristan reveals his secret love and attempts to prove how beautiful his original Iseult was by showing Kahedin a statue he had made of her. However, Kahedin is more impressed by a second statue of Brangaine, and journeys with Tristan back to Mark's lands in hopes of meeting her. In disguise they are able to tryst with the ladies, but Brangaine uses a magic pillow to put Kahedin to sleep before he can touch her. Eventually Iseult demands Brangaine sleep with him to end his dishonor. The short poem \"Kaherdin and Camille\" records a similar story; in this case the name of Iseult's servant is Camille.\n\nBrangaine's role in the Prose \"Tristan\" is sometimes different from in the verse works. For example, the scene in which the handmaid substitutes for Iseult on her wedding night is excluded, and while the tree-tying episode is still present, it is not Iseult but jealous rival servants who order the deed. Additionally she is rescued by the Saracen knight Palamedes, rather than her mistress as in the older works.\n\nAccording to Rachel Bromwich, several parallels can be drawn between the character of Brangaine in French Arthurian romance and that of Branwen in medieval Welsh legend, lending credence to the theory that the former is ultimately based on the latter.\n\n"}

{"id": "2352987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2352987", "title": "Constantine the Great and Christianity", "text": "Constantine the Great and Christianity\n\nDuring the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (AD 306–337), Christianity began to transition to the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. Historians remain uncertain about Constantine's reasons for favoring Christianity, and theologians and historians have often argued about which form of early Christianity he subscribed to. There is no consensus among scholars as to whether he adopted his mother Helena's Christianity in his youth, or, as claimed by Eusebius, encouraged her to convert to the faith he had adopted himself. Some scholars question the extent to which he should be considered a Christian emperor: \"Constantine saw himself as an 'emperor of the Christian people'. If this made him a Christian is the subject of debate,\" although he allegedly received a baptism shortly before his death.\n\nConstantine's decision to cease the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire was a turning point for early Christianity, sometimes referred to as the Triumph of the Church, the Peace of the Church or the Constantinian shift. In 313, Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan decriminalizing Christian worship. The emperor became a great patron of the Church and set a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor within the Church and the notion of orthodoxy, Christendom, ecumenical councils, and the state church of the Roman Empire declared by edict in 380. He is revered as a saint and isapostolos in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church, and various Eastern Catholic Churches for his example as a \"Christian monarch.\"\n\nThe first recorded official persecution of Christians on behalf of the Roman Empire was in AD 64, when, as reported by the Roman historian Tacitus, Emperor Nero attempted to blame Christians for the Great Fire of Rome. According to Church tradition, it was during the reign of Nero that Peter and Paul were martyred in Rome. However, modern historians debate whether the Roman government distinguished between Christians and Jews prior to Nerva's modification of the \"Fiscus Judaicus\" in 96, from which point practicing Jews paid the tax and Christians did not.\n\nChristians suffered from sporadic and localized persecutions over a period of two and a half centuries. Their refusal to participate in Imperial cult was considered an act of treason and was thus punishable by execution. The most widespread official persecution was carried out by Diocletian. During the Great Persecution (303–311), the emperor ordered Christian buildings and the homes of Christians torn down and their sacred books collected and burned. Christians were arrested, tortured, mutilated, burned, starved, and condemned to gladiatorial contests to amuse spectators. The Great Persecution officially ended in April 311, when Galerius, senior emperor of the Tetrarchy, issued an edict of toleration, which granted Christians the right to practice their religion, though it did not restore any property to them. Constantine, Caesar in the Western empire, and Licinius, Caesar in the East, also were signatories to the edict of toleration. It has been speculated that Galerius' reversal of his long-standing policy of Christian persecution has been attributable to one or both of these co-Caesars.\n\nIt is possible (but not certain) that Constantine's mother, Helena, exposed him to Christianity; in any case he only declared himself a Christian after issuing the Edict of Milan. Writing to Christians, Constantine made clear that he believed that he owed his successes to the protection of that High God alone.\n\nEusebius of Caesarea and other Christian sources record that Constantine experienced a dramatic event in 312 at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, after which Constantine claimed the emperorship in the West. According to these sources, Constantine looked up to the sun before the battle and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words \"\" (in this sign, conquer), often rendered in a Latin version, \"in hoc signo vinces\" (in this sign, you will conquer). Constantine commanded his troops to adorn their shields with a Christian symbol (the Chi-Rho), and thereafter they were victorious.\n\nFollowing the battle, the new emperor ignored the altars to the gods prepared on the Capitoline and did not carry out the customary sacrifices to celebrate a general's victorious entry into Rome, instead heading directly to the imperial palace. Most influential people in the empire, however, especially high military officials, had not been converted to Christianity and still participated in the traditional religions of Rome; Constantine's rule exhibited at least a willingness to appease these factions. The Roman coins minted up to eight years after the battle still bore the images of Roman gods. The monuments he first commissioned, such as the Arch of Constantine, contained no reference to Christianity.\n\nIn 313 Constantine and Licinius announced \"that it was proper that the Christians and all others should have liberty to follow that mode of religion which to each of them appeared best,\" thereby granting tolerance to all religions, including Christianity. The Edict of Milan went a step further than the earlier Edict of Toleration by Galerius in 311, returning confiscated Church property. This edict made the empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship; it neither made the traditional religions illegal nor made Christianity the state religion, as occurred later with the Edict of Thessalonica of 380. The Edict of Milan did, however, raise the stock of Christianity within the empire and it reaffirmed the importance of religious worship to the welfare of the state.\n\nThe accession of Constantine was a turning point for early Christianity. After his victory, Constantine took over the role of patron of the Christian faith. He supported the Church financially, had an extraordinary number of basilicas built, granted privileges (e.g., exemption from certain taxes) to clergy, promoted Christians to high-ranking offices, returned property confiscated during the Great Persecution of Diocletian, and endowed the church with land and other wealth. Between 324 and 330, Constantine built a new imperial capital at Byzantium on the Bosporos, which would be named Constantinople for him. Unlike \"old\" Rome, the city began to employ overtly Christian architecture, contained churches within the city walls, and had no pre-existing temples from other religions.\n\nIn doing this, however, Constantine required those who had not converted to Christianity to pay for the new city. Christian chroniclers tell that it appeared necessary to Constantine \"to teach his subjects to give up their rites ... and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,\" This led to the closure of temples because of a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure; Constantine did not need to use force to implement this. Only the chronicler Theophanes has added that temples \"were annihilated\", but this was considered \"not true\" by contemporary historians.\n\nConstantine respected cultivated persons, and his court was composed of older, respected, and honored men. Men from leading Roman families who declined to convert to Christianity were denied positions of power yet still received appointments; even up to the end of his life, two-thirds of his top government were non-Christian.\n\nConstantine's laws enforced and reflected his Christian attitudes. Crucifixion was abolished for reasons of Christian piety, but was replaced with hanging, to demonstrate the preservation of Roman supremacy. On March 7, 321, Sunday, already sacred to Christians and to the Roman Sun God Sol Invictus, was declared an official day of rest. On that day markets were banned and public offices were closed, except for the purpose of freeing slaves. There were, however, no restrictions on performing farming work, which was the work of the great majority of the population, on Sundays.\n\nSome laws made during his reign were even humane in the modern sense, possibly inspired by his Christianity: a prisoner was no longer to be kept in total darkness but must be given the outdoors and daylight; a condemned man was allowed to die in the arena, but he could not be branded on his \"heavenly beautified\" face, since God was supposed to have made man in his image, but only on the feet. Publicly displayed gladiatorial games were ordered to be eliminated in 325.\n\nIn 331, Constantine commissioned Eusebius to deliver fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople. Athanasius (\"Apol. Const. 4\") recorded around 340 Alexandrian scribes preparing Bibles for Constans. Little else is known. It has been speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus are examples of these Bibles. Together with the Peshitta and Codex Alexandrinus, these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.\n\nThe reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define orthodoxy and maintain orthodoxy. The Church generally regarded the definition of doctrine as the responsibility of the bishops; the emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity. The emperor ensured that God was properly worshiped in his empire; what proper worship (orthodoxy) and doctrines and dogma consisted of was for the Church to determine.\n\nConstantine had become a worshiper of the Christian God, but he found that there were many opinions on that worship and indeed on who and what that God was. In 316, Constantine was asked to adjudicate in a North African dispute between the Donatist sect (who began by refusing obedience to any bishops who had yielded in any way to persecution, later regarding all bishops but their own sect as utterly contaminated). More significantly, in 325 he summoned the First Council of Nicaea, effectively the first Ecumenical Council (unless the Council of Jerusalem is so classified). The Council of Nicaea is the first major attempt by Christians to define orthodoxy for the whole Church. Until Nicaea, all previous Church Councils had been local or regional synods affecting only portions of the Church.\n\nNicaea dealt primarily with the Arian controversy. Constantine himself was torn between the Arian and Trinitarian camps. After the Nicene council, and against its conclusions, he eventually recalled Arius from exile and banished Athanasius of Alexandria to Trier.\n\nJust before his death in May 337, Constantine was baptised into Christianity. Up until this time he had been a catechuman for most of his adult life. He believed that if he waited to get baptized on his death bed he was in less danger of polluting his soul with sin and not getting to heaven. He was baptized by his distant relative Arian Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia. During Eusebius of Nicomedia's time in the Imperial court, the Eastern court and the major positions in the Eastern Church were held by Arians or Arian sympathizers. With the exception of a short period of eclipse, Eusebius enjoyed the complete confidence both of Constantine and Constantius II and was the tutor of Emperor Julian the Apostate. After Constantine's death, his son and successor Constantius II was an Arian, as was Emperor Valens.\n\nConstantine's position on the religions traditionally practiced in Rome evolved during his reign. In fact, his coinage and other official motifs, until 325, had affiliated him with the pagan cult of Sol Invictus. At first, Constantine encouraged the construction of new temples and tolerated traditional sacrifices; by the end of his reign, he had begun to order the pillaging and tearing down of Roman temples.\n\nBeyond the \"limes\", east of the Euphrates, the Sasanian rulers of the Persian Empire, perennially at war with Rome, had usually tolerated Christianity. Constantine is said to have written to Shapur II in 324 and urged him to protect Christians under his rule. With the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, Christians in Persia would be regarded as allies of Persia's ancient enemy. According to an anonymous Christian account, Shapur II wrote to his generals:\n\nConstantinian shift is a term used by some theologians and historians of antiquity to describe the political and theological aspects and outcomes of the 4th-century process of Constantine's integration of the Imperial government with the Church that began with the First Council of Nicaea. The term was popularized by the Mennonite theologian John H. Yoder.\n\nThe claim that there ever was Constantinian shift has been disputed; Peter Leithart argues that there was a \"brief, ambiguous 'Constantinian moment' in the fourth century,\" but that there was \"no permanent, epochal 'Constantinian shift'.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The UK Customs undercover team, delivered cannabis owned by Customs, to a beach in Cornwall where they were met by a \"shore party\" who had been under surveillance by Officers dug in on the hillside . Further arrests were made assisted by a Devon And Cornwall Police armed team. After a six-week Crown Court trial at Exeter in front of Judge Sean Overend during which the defence team tried to maintain that the drugs lost in Bisacy were Henna not Cannabis, Huck was found Guilty on attempting to import Illegal substances, and possession of a class B drug With intent to supply and given 14 years in a high security Class A prison, with the option of parole. The 14 years was the highest possible and highest ever sentence given in the UK for Cannabis trafficking. The Crown Court also considered a fine of £1,000,000 to accompany the 14-year jail sentence but the jury rejected this proposal. Huck was released from an unknown prison after serving 10 years of his sentence, with 4 months left of his probation, Huck travelled to Amsterdam and received a call, this call was logged and Huck was arrested by Dutch police and charged for talking to known criminals, an offence which is not present in the UK. Huck was then kept on remand for a year and found guilty but released as he had already served his sentence while he was on remand.\n"}

As an adjective, \"dyadic\" describes their interaction.\n\nThe pair of individuals in a dyad can be linked via romantic interest, family relation, interests, work, partners in crime, and so on. The relation can be based on equality, but may be based on an asymmetrical or hierarchical relationship (master–servant).\n\nThe strength of the relationship is evaluated on the basis of time the individuals spend together, as well as on the emotional intensity of their relationship.\n\nA dyad can be unstable because both persons must cooperate to make it work. If one of the two fails to complete their duties, the group would fall apart. Because of the significance of marriages in society, their stability is very important. For this reason marital dyads are often enforced through legal, economic, and religious laws.\n\nDyadic friendships refer to the most immediate and concrete level of peer interaction, which is expanded to include new forms of relationships in adolescence – most notably, romantic and sexual relationships. Already Ferdinand Tönnies treated it as a special pattern of \"gemeinschaft\", 1887, as \"community of spirit\".\n\nDyad means two things of similar kind or nature or group and dyadic communication means the inter-relationship between the two. In practice, this relationship refers to dialogic relations or face-to-face verbal communication between two people involving their mutual ideas, thought, behaviour, ideals, liking, disliking, and the queries and answers concerning life and living in nature. A sudden communication between two strangers in the street and not continued afterwards or not having lasting aftereffect on each other can not be termed as dyadic communication. Examples of dyadic communication occur between Jesus and Peter, the Buddha and Ananda, or between Socrates and Plato, where dialog is not only outward, superficial, or mechanical, but instead brings the two people into a sphere where each person influences the other.\n\nA lasting communication of ideas between two people for long duration of time or of any intensive duration of deeper impact may be called dyadic communication.\n"}

V. Ilyina, and an Orthodox priest F.A. Petrov (according to other sources, archpriest Sergushenkov). Alternatively, \"... his father was Fedor Ilyin, a progressive St. Petersburg churchman, a widower who could not legally remarry and whose sons were therefore technically illegitimate. The Ilyin family life was fairly normal ...\" He graduated from Prince Oldenburgsky Orphanage, studied at Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute, and then at the Midshipman (\"gardemarin\") School in Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn December 1910 he joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and he was attracted to \"Zvezda\" and went on to work for the Bolshevik newspaper, Pravda. He was arrested, and allowed to emigrate, but after running into trouble with the German police, he returned illegally to Russia, and was again arrested and exiled to Arkhangel, but released in 1913 under the amnesty called to mark the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty. He enlisted in the navy on the outbreak of war, and in 1917 he received the Naval rank of Midshipman (\"michman\") but he did not participate in World War I.\n\nIn March 1917 he was sent to the sea fortress of Kronstadt, where he edited the newspaper \"Golos Pravdy\" (Voice of Truth): an incarnation of the forbidden at that time Pravda newspaper. He was one of the organizers of the Kronstadt Mutiny in July 1917. He was arrested by troops loyal to the Russian Provisional Government but released on October 11, 1917, a few weeks before the October Revolution.\n\nIn November 1917 Raskolnikov with a group of Kronstadt seamen was sent to fight anti-Bolshevik insurgents in Moscow. He was elected to the Russian Constituent Assembly. On 29 January 1918 he became the deputy Narkom of \"Naval Affairs\". In summer 1918, he married Larisa Reisner. In July 1918, he was sent to the Kazan, as the Commissar (member of Revvoeyensovet) of the Eastern Front. On the Eastern Front, he commanded (since August 1918) the Red Volga Flotilla, which participated in the Kazan Operation.\n\nRaskolnikov was promoted to membership of the Revvoeyensovet of RSFSR on (September 2, 1918). At the end of 1918 he became the deputy commander of the 7th Army and the Commissar of the Baltic Fleet.\n\nWhile commanding a fleet consisting of a battleship, cruiser and two destroyers that was supposed to counter the British fleet, he became a prisoner of war when his destroyer \"Spartak\" was captured by the Royal Navy off the coast of Estonia in December 1918, and held in Brixton prison until May 27, 1919, when he was exchanged for 17 British prisoners of war. Appointed commander of the Caspian Flotilla he led the assault on the British base at Enzeli, on May 18, 1920 which destroyed what remained of the White Russian navy, and established the short lived soviet republic in Ghilan, in northern Iran.\n\nDuring the Trade Union debate (1920) Raskolnikov supported Leon Trotsky. In June 1920 – January 1921 Raskolnikov commanded the Baltic Fleet. During his tenure relations between the commanding officers and seamen deteriorated and ended with the Kronstadt Rebellion. A month later Raskolnikov was removed from that command.\n\nDuring 1921–1923 Raskolnikov was the ambassador to Afghanistan (the first country that established diplomatic relations with RSFSR). Raskolnikov's actions caused a diplomatic rift with Great Britain and the British government insisted on his removal. Eventually he was replaced.\n\nFrom 1930 Raskolnikov was the plenipotentiary representative to Estonia, then Denmark, and then Bulgaria.\n\nIn March 1938 he was recalled from Sofia to the USSR, but on April 1 refused to return. In 1939 he published his famous \"Open Letter to Stalin\", and promptly died from \"falling out of a window.\" According to historian Roy Medvedev, he might have been assassinated by NKVD agents. There are theories that the assassin might have been Sergei Efron, husband of the poet Marina Tsvetayeva.\n\nRaskolnikov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1963.\n\nDuring 1924–1930 Raskolnikov was the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine \"Molodaya Gvardiya\" (later also publishing house \"Moskovsky Rabochy\"). From 1928 he was the chairman of the \"Repertory Committee\", the de facto main censor of theatre and cinematography. He also wrote his own play \"Robespierre\" which even servile critics labelled \"dry and boring\".\n\n\n"}

The sect was found to have engaged in fortune telling fraud in Japan.\n\nIt is often called the \"foot reading cult\", because its founder, Hogen Fukunaga, claimed he could make a diagnosis by examining people's feet. He founded the group in 1987 after an alleged spiritual event where he claimed to have realized he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and the Buddha. The group at one time claimed 30,000 members. However, Fukunaga charged $900 for the foot readings and a suspicion arose that he used the money to benefit himself. He was accused of swindling money from housewives and had to pay over a million dollars in damages.\n\nFukunaga started preaching in 1980, claiming to be the world's final savior following Jesus Christ and Buddha. He was then 34 and saddled with 500 million yen of debt. Soon he became a household name through the publication of texts (nearly 70 at latest count) penned by ghostwriters. In 1987 the sect gained official recognition as a religious corporation.\n\nIn a twist on palm reading, Fukunaga and other cult leaders read the soles of people's feet. They told the victims, who visited the cult for counseling about physical or family problems, that their problems would worsen unless they attended a cult seminar, which cost 2.25 million yen, or donated up to 14.3 million yen to the cult. They used shocking words to fuel their concern, falsely claimed their diseases could be cured through training in his cult, and swindled exorbitant amounts of money from them. They were urged to purchase high-priced scrolls and other ornaments that were said to ward off evil, cure illnesses, deliver from sin, and break family curses.\n\nThe intimidation was often accompanied by a specific threat. A victim was coerced during a number of visits by cult officials to shell out another $22,000 for a five-day training seminar at the cult's sprawling headquarters below Mount Fuji. The purpose, he said, was to \"purify\" his mind and body.\n\nThe leader set cult members strict recruitment goals in a bid to swell the group's ranks. Separate goals were set for each of the group's branch offices. When the cult's new facility was being built, at a cost of 600 million yen, Fukunaga reportedly ordered cult members to work toward an even harder goal.\nStaff members eagerly studied Fukunaga's methods of threatening people to make them enroll in special training sessions, the sources said. At these meetings, Fukunaga repeatedly said that lying was acceptable to lure people to enroll in the special training. \"You should use your 'wisdom' and say things, even if they may not actually be true.\" He explained that lies were acceptable as people would learn reason once they began the special training. The group prepared a manual to train people.\n\nFukunaga would wear $5,000 suits and custom-made Italian shoes. His wife, according to senior cult members, regularly spent $6,000 to $7,000 a month shopping. Fukunaga reportedly obtained 60 billion yen from more than 10,000 people over the past 13 years, while he spent enormous amounts enhancing his reputation as a religious leader by \"buying\" audiences with former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II, President Clinton, Mother Teresa, Margaret Thatcher, Sathya Sai Baba and celebrities.\n\nAccording to a report by Christian newsweekly \"World\": \"The Clinton White House fundraising scandal\",\n\nIn May 1996, a fundraising dinner organized by Mr. Huang was held at the Sheraton Carlton Hotel in Washington, D.C. Yogesh Gandhi, a distant relative of Mahatma Gandhi, paid for his ticket and that of a friend, Dr. Hogen Fukunaga, with a $325,000 contribution. (At the dinner, Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Fukunaga presented Mr. Clinton the 1996 \"Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Award.\") Mr. Fukunaga, leader of a Japanese religious sect known as Ho no Hana Sanpogyo, is a multimillionaire, while Mr. Gandhi, a naturalized American, is a man of little means, indeed a \"pauper\", according to papers filed in his recent divorce case. After \"The Los Angeles Times\" reported in October the details of Mr. Gandhi's lowly economic status, the DNC concluded that the $325,000 he had donated probably never belonged to him and returned \"his\" money.\n\nThe founder was sentenced to 12 years in prison for bilking his flock out of 150 million yen in the name of religious training. 15 senior cult members were charged with the mass fraud. Nine of the 15 were given verdicts, with all of them convicted. Prosecutors charged them with practicing medicine without a license. Fukunaga might yet face manslaughter charges in the deaths of four recruits who died during rigorous initiation rites at Mount Fuji.\n\nLegal experts say Japan's criminal justice system is ill-equipped to combat the cult phenomenon.\n\n"}

He was the elder brother of Frederick Guest, Oscar Guest and Henry Guest, and a first cousin of Winston Churchill. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nHe was commissioned a lieutenant in the Dorset Yeomanry on 9 May 1896. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, he volunteered for service and was appointed a lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry on 24 February 1900, leaving England for South Africa on the \"SS Manchester Merchant\" in early March. He was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with two clasps. After returning to the United Kingdom, he was promoted to captain on 18 January 1902.\n\nHe was elected to Parliament for Plymouth in a by-election in February 1900 (a seat he had unsuccessfully contested in 1898), as a Conservative, and retained his seat in the general election of 1900. In 1904, during the controversy within the Conservative Party over adopting protectionism, he and other members of his family followed Churchill into the Liberal Party in support of free trade.\n\nHe sat as an MP until 1910, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ashby St Ledgers, of Ashby St Ledgers in the County of Northampton, and became Paymaster General in the government of H. H. Asquith. He served as Paymaster General until 1912, and later served as a Lord in Waiting on King George V.\n\nIn 1914, he succeeded his father as Baron Wimborne. At the start of World War I, he was appointed to the staff of the newly formed 10th (Irish) Division under Lieutenant-General Sir Bryan Mahon at the Curragh Camp.\n\nIn February 1915, Wimborne was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in succession to Lord Aberdeen. At this time, the Lord Lieutenant was largely a ceremonial position; real power was in the hands of the Chief Secretary and the Under-Secretary. Determined to be more involved in decision-making, he was appointed Director of Recruiting in October 1915, heading up the new Department of Recruiting for Ireland. He insisted on being kept up to date on the state of the country, and had the Under-Secretary, Sir Matthew Nathan, send him police reports, details of prosecutions and recruitment figures.\n\nOn the weekend preceding the Easter Rising, following the capture of the German arms ship \"Aud\" and the arrest of Sir Roger Casement, Wimborne urged Nathan to order the arrest of a large number of rebel leaders. Nathan was unwilling to do so without the authorisation of the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell, who was in London. Before the authorisation was received, the Rising began on 24 April 1916. Wimborne proclaimed martial law in Dublin. Thereafter, the military took control. A new Commander-in Chief, General Sir John Maxwell, arrived in Ireland on 28 April and the rebels surrendered on 29 April. Wimborne initially refused to offer his resignation after the Rising. He resigned under pressure from the government but was re-appointed.\n\nThe Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion (the Hardinge commission) exonerated Wimborne of any blame for the Rising, saying that his position as Lord Lieutenant was \"anomalous in quiet times and almost unworkable in times of crisis\". He continued as Lord Lieutenant for another two years. On his retirement in 1918, he was created Viscount Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset.\n\nOn 10 February 1902, he married at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, London, the Honourable Alice Grosvenor (1880–1948), daughter of Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Baron Ebury. They had one son, Ivor Guest, 2nd Viscount Wimborne, and two daughters, Rosemary and Cynthia.\n\nBy the 1930s, they were living separate lives, though remaining on the friendliest terms. From 1934 until her death, Alice was linked with the composer William Walton. Wimborne died in June 1939, aged 66, at Wimborne House in Arlington Street, London, the house in which he was born. He was succeeded by his only son, Ivor. Lady Wimborne died in April 1948, aged 67.\n"}

They married after the end of World War II, and in 1948 escaped from the new Communist regime by making their way to Austria. Arriving as refugees in Britain, they settled in Yorkshire. Jan worked in a stone quarry at Tadcaster and as a miner, and Vlasta worked as a housemaid in Hundhill\n\nIn his spare time Jan Dalibor began making wooden marionettes, and Vlasta suggested that he make some in the shape of pigs, a symbol of good luck in Czechoslovakia. They began performing with their puppets in 1951, and made their first appearance in a summer season show at Heysham in 1956. The puppets \"Pinky\" and \"Perky\" (originally \"Porky\") were initially minor uncredited characters in the show. They were seen there by Trevor Hill, producer of \"The Sooty Show\", and the Dalibors made their first television appearance later that year on a BBC talent show, \"It's Up to You\", which featured the two puppet piglets. \n\nIn 1958, Pinky and Perky began nine years of regular series on BBC television, their show often appearing immediately before the regular early evening news bulletin, where their comments on current affairs occasionally attracted controversy. The shows also included many other marionettes constructed by Jan Dalibor, and his work was noted for its fine craftsmanship which enabled the puppets to be shown in close-up. Over 200 episodes of the show were broadcast. At the peak of their popularity in the early and mid-1960s, the shows attracted audiences of 15 million, and the characters, with high-pitched speeded-up voices, appeared on records as well as a wide range of merchandise. They appeared at the 1963 Royal Variety Performance alongside the Beatles and Marlene Dietrich, and the characters also became popular in the US, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and in Las Vegas. \n\nIn 1968, the \"Pinky and Perky\" television series was dropped by the BBC but moved to Thames Television for a further four years. The Dalibors retired in 1973, and sold the rights to their characters for £500,000. The characters were revived on BBC television in 2008.\n\nThe couple retired to Newport, Pembrokeshire. Jan Dalibor died in 2013, and Vlasta in 2016.\n"}

Worth, Texas from 1876-1879. In 1887, he was killed in a shootout with gambler and gunfighter Luke Short. Before his death, people feared Courtright's reputation as a gunman, and he successfully reduced Ft. Worth's murder rate by more than half, while reportedly extracting protection money from town business owners.\n\nCourtright was born in Sangamon County, Illinois, which includes the capital city of Springfield, in the spring of 1848, the son of Daniel Courtright. He had four older sisters and one younger brother. He was also reported to have practiced shooting frequently. He lied about his age and enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He served under General John A. Logan for whom he once took a bullet and therefore earned Logan's admiration. He was rootless, and traveled around often until he finally settled in Fort Worth in north Texas. While in Fort Worth, Courtright was at various times a jailer, city marshal, deputy sheriff, deputy U.S. Marshal, hired killer, private detective, and racketeer. During his travels, Courtright had developed a reputation as being fast with a gun.\n\nHe married Sarah Weeks and taught her how to shoot. They held shooting exhibitions for which they charged admission, and later performed as part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.\n\nCourtright and his wife arrived in Ft. Worth in 1876. He ran for office as the first elected city marshal against four other men, and won by three votes. He liked to wear his hair long and wore two revolvers with their butts facing forward, showman style. He became known for his long hair and his reputation for using his badge as a matter of convenience.\n\nAs marshal, he was in charge of keeping the peace in the notorious \"Hells Half Acre\" (the town's red-light district). At that time, Fort Worth was a very dangerous place, with altercations between unruly drunks and lawmen being commonplace. Few people dared to cross him, and he killed several who did. On August 25, 1877, Deputy Marshal Columbus Fitzgerald was shot and killed while attempting to break up a street fight. Courtright shot and killed the suspect that same night. During his tenure as Ft. Worth Marshal, it's reported that he killed at least four other men during altercations and shootouts.\n\nIt was generally believed that he murdered several unwilling business owners who would not pay into his protection racket. Most met his demand to avoid the risk of becoming the target of his anger and gun. Some who declined died, and those who survived usually made the payments demanded.\n\nHe served as Ft. Worth's Marshal until 1879, when he lost his third election. He left his family behind, he moved to New Mexico and obtained appointment as the Marshal of Lake Valley, and after that as a hired guard for a mining operation. Sometime later, while working as a ranch foreman, he and his friend Jim McIntire shot and killed two squatters who had refused to leave the ranch.\n\nIn 1883, his former Civil War commander John A. Logan was interested in purchasing the American Valley Cattle Company in New Mexico. The company controlled a vast tract of land about wide. Maintaining that he was concerned about ongoing cattle rustling that was decimating herds, U.S. Marshal A. L. Morisson invited his deputies Courtright and Jim McIntire to help secure the land.\n\nBut the current owner John P. Casey and his partners W. C. Moore and Henry M. Atkison had bigger ambitions: they wanted ownership of an additional acres with water rights that would allow them to gain control of an additional of quality grazing land. They had already forced about 90 residents of the small community of Rito off their land. But Alexis Grossetete and Robert Elsinger, partners in a ranch at Gallo Springs were resistant to Moore's threats. They had claimed their land under preemption rights that guaranteed settlers the right to file a patent on unsurveyed land. Both had brought their families onto the land and made it evident they intended to stay. Casey accused them of being squatters and was determined to evict them.\n\nCasey's partner W. C. Moore had a dark past. He was hired by D. T. Beals and W. H. Bates, owners of the LX Ranch in the Texas Panhandle, to manage a large herd. He started in 1877 but during 1881 they discovered that he was siphoning off a good portion of the stock for his own herd and they fired him. Moore sold his Adobe Walls Ranch for $75,000 (or about $ million in today's dollars) and used $25,000 of the proceeds to buy a one-third interest in Casey's American Valley Cattle Company. Courtwright may have initially believed he was only hired to pursue cattle rustlers. He was told by Moore that they were pursuing a former employee of Casey's named D. L. Gilmore near Socorro, New Mexico. Moore led the posse directly to the ranch headquarters in American Valley and the next day they looked for Gilmore's cowboys, ending the day at a line cabin about from Grossetete's and Elsinger's homes. The next day Moore took five of the posse and rode towards their homes. Moore told the party that their job was to get rid of the two \"squatters.\" He said all six would fire into their bodies so all six would be equally guilty. They found the men, took their weapons, marched them to a narrow ravine, and killed them both.\n\nDaniel H. McAllister, a Deacon in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had been until a few days before the manager of Casey's ranch. When he learned of the murders, he informed the authorities, who promptly called for Moore and his fellow posse members' arrest. Courtwright and McIntire initially acted as lawmen and arrested the others who had taken part in the murders, but when the grand jury convened, they learned that the two men had also taken part. Moore escaped arrest, and before Courtwright and McIntire could be apprehended, they took off for Mexico on horseback, finally ending up on June 1 in El Paso, Texas, where they found safety among a number of former Texas Rangers who knew them both. Courtwright sent for his wife and children who had been in Los Angeles. McIntire also summoned his wife and the two families headed to Ft. Worth, where they successfully fought extradition to New Mexico, claiming the two men were \"Mexicans\" and they had been performing their duties as lawmen.\n\nSecure in Ft. Worth, in 1884 Courtwright tried once again to form a detective agency. In New Mexico, two men were tried and acquitted of the murders, and authorities renewed their effort to bring Courtwright to justice.\n\nLuke Short was a gunfighter, gambler and bar owner who had drifted down to Fort Worth from Dodge City, Kansas. While in Dodge City, Short had dabbled in gambling, and became friends with several other noted Old West figures, such as Bat Masterson, Jim Masterson and Wyatt Earp, who had also become friends with Courtright. In Fort Worth, he managed the \"White Elephant\", a saloon/gambling house.\n\nMarshal Courtright was running a protection racket at the time, and needed to make an example of Short, who also had a sizable reputation as a gunfighter mostly due to an 1881 gunfight with gunslinger Charlie Storms at the \"Oriental Saloon\" in Tombstone, Arizona. Most historians believe that Courtright offered protection to the White Elephant and that Short informed him that he did not need his protection.\n\nOn February 8, 1887, at about 8:00 p.m., Courtright called out Luke Short, carrying a pair of pistols, and challenging him to come out of the White Elephant, but a friend Jake Johnson managed to calm him down and told him that they should talk about the affair instead. In Short's own accounts, both men walked up the street one block, until they were in front of bar and brothel owner Ella Blackwell's Shooting Gallery, the two men facing one another three to four feet apart. Words were passed, and evidently Courtright, who had been drinking considerably, had made some indication about Short having a gun. Short assured Courtright he was not armed, although he was. Short moved slowly toward Courtright, saying that he could have a look himself, at which point he pulled open his vest. Courtright then said loudly \"Don't you pull a gun on me.\" With that statement, Courtright drew his pistol and in that second Short produced his pistol and fired one shot, which took off Courtright's thumb on his shooting hand. As Courtright attempted to shift his pistol to his other hand, Short fired four more shots in quick succession. Courtright fell backward and died shortly thereafter.\n\nThe showdown was also witnessed by fellow gunfighter Bat Masterson, who was with Luke Short at that time. In 1907 Masterson published his own, more neutral account of the events that unfold, in which he stated that it was Jim Courtright, who called for Luke Short to meet him in the street for a confrontation, while carrying a \"brace of pistols\" of his own. Masterson described what followed:\n\nInvestigations on the gunfight concluded that while it was Courtright who went for his pistol first, it was Short who ultimately outdrew and killed him. Courtright's inability to fire off a shot was due to a number of possible scenarios; one was that his pistol got caught on his watch chain for a second as he drew it, and another was that his pistol broke when one of Short's bullets struck it and his thumb.\n\nShort was tried for the shooting, but it was ruled justified self defense, and the charges were dismissed. The gunfight gained notoriety due to the reputation of both men. Unfortunately for Courtright, that fame was .\n\nDespite Courtright's reputation for strong-arming local businesses with his \"protection\" service, he did reduce Fort Worth's murder rate by more than half the previous level during his time there as the marshal. He built a small force that included himself and two deputies which eventually grew into today's Fort Worth police force.\n\nIn 1955, the half-hour syndicated television series \"Stories of the Century\", starring Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, aired the Jim Courtright story, with Robert Knapp in the title role and Wally Cassell as Luke Short.\n\nIn 1958, Karl Swenson was cast in an historically inaccurate portrayal of Courtright on the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, \"Colt .45,\" starring Wayde Preston. In the episode entitled \"Long Odds\", Swenson plays a grandfather visiting his 10-year-old grandson Billy, played by child actor Paul Engle. Billy has told his friends of his grandfather's prowess with a gun, but the elderly Courtright now shuns a confrontation with the gunfighter Cherry Lane, played by Robert J. Wilke, amid accusations of cowardice. The real Courtright was dead at thirty-nine and likely had no grandchildren. In the \"Colt .45\" episode, Swenson was fifty when he portrayed Courtright.\n"}

He was the son of Sir Christoffel Joseph Brand (1797–1875), speaker of the Cape legislative assembly, and Catharina Fredrica Küchler.\nJohannes Brand married in 1851 to Johanna Sibella Zastron, a daughter of the Registrar of Deeds in Cape Town. The couple had 8 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nJohannes Brand was born in Cape Town, and was educated at the South African College in that city. Continuing his studies at Leiden in the Netherlands, he took the degree of D.C.L. in 1845. He continued his law studies in Britain and was called to the English bar at the Inner Temple in 1849.\n\nAfter his return to South Africa Brand settled in Cape Town, where he practised as an advocate in the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope until 1863.\nIn 1858 Brand was appointed professor of law in the South African College. As a young Member of the Cape Parliament, he became a keen supporter of John Molteno's \"Responsible Government\" movement, which advocated greater independence from Britain. However, finding its principles too moderate, he decided to emigrate to the Orange Free State, in solidarity with its strong republican ideals.\n\nHe was elected president of the Orange Free State in 1863, and subsequently re-elected for five year terms in 1869, 1874, 1879 and 1884. In 1864 he resisted the pressure of the Basuto on the Free State boundary, and after vainly endeavouring to induce Moshesh, the Basuto chief, to keep his people within bounds, he took up arms against them in 1865. This first war ended in the Treaty of Thaba Bosigo, signed on 3 April 1866; and a second war, which ended in the Treaty of Aliwal North, concluded on 12 February 1869. In 1871 he opposed the British annexation of the town of Kimberley without success.\n\nIn 1871 Brand was solicited by a large party to become president of the South African Republic (Transvaal), and thus unite the two Boer republics of South Africa; but as the project was hostile to Great Britain he declined to do so, and maintained his constant policy of neutrality towards England, where his merits were recognised in 1882 when he was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.\n\nJohannes Brand was deeply religious and irreproachable in both public and private life. He was extremely popular with the burghers of the Orange Free State. Brand's expression \"alles zal recht komen als elkeen zijn plicht doet\" (all will be well if everyone does his duty) has entered the Afrikaans language as a well-known and often used saying. After his death a statue funded by public subscription was erected in Bloemfontein. The main road in the Bloemfontein city centre was named \"President Brand\" in his honour.\n\nBrand was a South African Freemason.\n"}

In 1963, she married Leslie John \"Johnny\" Cole, who was shot dead in Sydney drug-related gangland conflict in 1982. Cole was the father of their son Mark Cole, born in 1964 (later Mark Moran). Judy began a relationship with Lewis Moran in 1966 and was divorced from Cole at the time of his death. Judy and Lewis Moran had a son Jason Moran in 1967. The Morans separated in 1995.\n\nMark Moran was murdered in 2000, Jason Moran was murdered in 2003, and Lewis Moran was shot dead in 2004. \n\nDesmond Moran, Lewis's brother, was murdered in June 2009. Judy Moran was arrested, charged and subsequently convicted of his murder. In 2011 she was sentenced to 26 years' jail, with a minimum of 21.\n\nJust under two weeks after the death of her de facto husband, Lewis Moran, Judy Moran signed with celebrity agent Harry M. Miller and announced that she was planning to write a book of her experiences, intending to \"clear her estranged partner's name.\" The announcement immediately brought criticism: both police and the leader of the Victorian Opposition, Robert Doyle, were reported to be \"outraged\" at the news, and a victims of crimes group called for new legislation to prevent the book from being published. However, while Victorian law prohibits people convicted of a crime from writing or selling stories about those actions, Judy Moran had never been convicted or charged in relation to her family's activities. \n\nAlthough the book was delayed in October 2004, it was released in February 2005 as \"My Story\" through Random House, and covered her upbringing in Carlton, the murders of her husbands and two sons, and her relationship with other underworld figures. Less than a week later, Random House recalled the book from sale and pulped 20,000 copies after it was revealed that the book contained false allegations in regard to a deceased Victorian detective, Fred Silvester. At the time Random House stated that the book would be reprinted without the false allegations, and the book was reprinted and returned to book stores in May of that year. As of August 2005 over 4,500 copies of the book had been sold. \n\nIn 2007, Moran revealed that she was in the process of writing a second book.\n\nOn 15 June 2009 Moran's brother-in-law Des Moran (commonly known as \"Tuppence\") and brother of Lewis, was shot dead in Ascot Vale. On 16 June, Judy Moran and three others were arrested in connection with his murder. Those arrested include 45-year-old Suzanne Kane, sister-in-law of Moran's deceased son Jason Moran and daughter of Painter and Docker Les Kane, an associate of Lewis Moran who was murdered in his family home on 19 October 1978. Moran and Kane were subsequently charged with being an accessory after the fact and Kane's partner, 43-year-old Geoffrey Amour, was arrested in Portland and charged with murder. The fourth person arrested was later released without charge.\n\nAt an out-of-sessions bail hearing in the evening of 16 June, police alleged Moran concealed the getaway car in her garage and later disposed of it in Mincha Street, Brunswick. Police had her under surveillance and she was arrested as she walked back to her home. Police discovered a rifle in the abandoned car and white gloves Moran was allegedly seen wearing while driving the car were found discarded in bushes nearby. On executing a warrant on Moran's home, police allegedly discovered a hidden safe containing three hand guns, two stolen Victorian licence plates, a wig and clothing which police claim matches witness descriptions of clothing worn by the gunmen. Moran was remanded into custody on 16 June and later that night her home in Ascot Vale was set on fire in an apparent arson attack. \n\nOn 17 June 2009, Moran and Suzanne Kane appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. Bail was denied on the grounds that their access to weapons represented a danger to the community and remanded them into custody to reappear on 9 September. On 18 September 2009, Kane's partner, Geoffrey Amour, faced Melbourne Magistrates' Court charged with murder. He was also remanded to reappear on 9 September and magistrate Dan Muling granted his lawyer's application for an order suppressing publication of Amour's image. Amour would later plead guilty.\n\nOn 9 March 2011, a jury found Judy Moran guilty of murdering Desmond Moran, and was sentenced on 10 August 2011 to 26 years' jail, with a minimum of 21. Suzanne Kane was sentenced on 2 February 2011 to two years' jail, suspended for two years.\n\nMoran was portrayed by Caroline Gillmer in the 2008 TV series \"Underbelly\".\nIn 2014, Moran was played by Debra Byrne in the mini series \"Fat Tony & Co.\" and she reprised her role in 2017's \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "29262983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29262983", "title": "Justus Velsius", "text": "Justus Velsius\n\nJustus Velsius, Haganus, or \"Joost Welsens\" in Dutch (c. 1510, The Hague, Low Countries – after 1581 at an unknown location), was a Dutch humanist, physician, and mathematician.\n\nVelsius started his career as a highly respected professor of liberal arts in Leuven, Strasbourg, and Cologne. Later on he portrayed himself as a prophet, and promoted his own particular view of Christianity, outlined in a pamphlet \"Christiani Hominis Norma\" which he wrote in London. He came into conflict with civil and ecclesiastical authorities all over Europe, and spent his final years as a preacher and faith healer in his native Holland. While in Cologne Velsius was married to Beatrix van Steenhoven, and later on, in Groningen, to Grete Cassens.\n\nAfter studying arts and medicine in Bologna, Velsius graduated as doctor medicinae in 1538 and settled down as physician in Antwerp, 1540/41. In 1541 he moved to Leuven, where he met Portuguese humanist Damião de Góis, and maintained friendly relations with Vesalius. Even though Velsius did not have a university position he held public lectures in Greek, Latin, philosophy and mathematics. In 1544 he proposed a course on Trebizond's \"Dialectica\". The authorities balked, and in the ensuing controversy they forced Velsius, whose theological purity was suspect, out of the university. In 1542 he had failed in his bid to succeed Nannius, and he moved to Strasbourg in 1544 at the recommendation of Bucer, after a short teaching stint at the Marburg Latin School and possibly in Basel.\n\nFrom Easter 1644-50 Velsius taught dialectic and Aristotelian ethics in the higher grades of the gymnasium in Strasbourg, as a co-worker of Johannes Sturm. On November 17, 1545 he received a canonicate at St. Thomas collegiate church, through the mediation of Bucer. Some time before October 17, 1548, he married Beatrix van Steenhoven. When Velsius got in trouble because he accepted the Interim and the resulting conflict with his Protestant colleagues, he moved to Cologne in the spring of 1550; he probably only gave up his Strasbourg canonicate in 1553.\n\nVelsius matriculated at Cologne on June 3, 1550. The Council of Cologne wanted to build a Trilingual school following the example of the University of Leuven, and appointed Velsius professor of philosophy and Greek, in August 1550. Since Velsius was married, he could not obtain a university prebend, but was instead remunerated by the council. His compensation was increased in 1551 and 1552, and he was charged with teaching mathematics as well. Velsius and his colleague Jakob Leichius, who was instrumental in establishing the Gymnasium Tricoronatum, drafted guidelines for a curriculum of eight grades, similar to Sturm’s humanistic curriculum in Strasbourg.\n\nVelsius attended the meetings of the Anabaptists in the Bookbinder's Guildhall at the Pfaffengasse, where he met Anabaptist martyr Thomas von Imbroich. Velsius’ philosophical writings, in particular the work of \"Krisis\" led to suspicion of heresy. On October 29, 1554 \"Krisis\" was condemned by Cologne University, and Velsius’ teaching license revoked (December 11, 1554, confirmed March 29, 1555), since he did not distance himself from his writing. Emperor Charles V, who had become involved at the instigation of the cathedral chapter, the clergy and the university, urged the council in vain to take action against Velsius, who on March 25, 1555 had published a defense, \"Epistola ad Ferdinandum\". Only after Velsius attempted to give theological lectures at his home, and rejected the Eucharistic adoration and celibacy, did the magistrate banish him in April 1555.\n\nVelsius refused to leave, and went voluntarily in detention, from December 1555 to the end of March 1556. He asked his influential friend Viglius to support him, but Viglius declined to get involved. Greatly offended by this refusal, Velsius apparently accused his friend of Protestant leanings, and severed all connections with his former friend. Because of this precedent the council adopted in 1555 a comprehensive directive against all heretics.\n\nThe Dominican Johannes Slotanus served as papal inquisitor for the Ecclesiastical province of Mainz, Cologne and Trier against Velsius and three other imprisoned people, whom he described as Anabaptists. The Protestant Princes intervened at the council on his behalf, in particular Christoph von Oldenburg. Since in December 1555 he had declared to adhere to the Augsburg Confession, Velsius was protected by the recently concluded Peace of Augsburg. On the night of 26 to 27 March 1556 he was taken by boat across the river and put ashore on the other side, in the Duchy of Berg. From there he made it to Mülheim, where he wrote \"Apologia\", addressed to the Emperor Charles and King Ferdinand. Slotanus replied in 1557 with the \"Apologia JV Hagani Confutatio\". In response Velsius wrote in September 1557 the \"Epistolae\". 1558 followed Slotanus' \"Disputationes adversus haereticos liber unus\".\n\n Velsius arrived in Frankfurt on July 15, 1556, approached Robert Horne, pastor of the English Church, and informed him of the revelations on which he wished to conduct a public dispute. Hearing of the arrival of Calvin, who came to arbitrate conflicts within the French Refugee Church, he offered the latter to preside. He proposed to defend the free will against the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. The debate with Calvin, Johannes à Lasco and Horne lasted two days; Velsius' argument boiled down to this: \"aut esse liberum arbitrium, aut Deum tyrannum esse\" (Either there is free will, or God is a tyrant).\n\nIn a letter addressed to Melanchthon, dated September 17, 1556, Calvin commented as follows:\nI have been dragged hither by the dissentions with which Satan has rent, for nearly two years, the little French church established here, and reduced to such extremities that it must have disappeared, unless some remedy had been very promptly applied. Since I entered the town I have not had a moment’s repose, and as if I had not had sufficient occupation in this affair, a madman called Velsius, to whom you had written twice, involved us in new fooleries. But we have devoted only two days to this importunity. I am continually distracted up to this moment, in appeasing those dissentions which, from the long lapse of time, have struck deep root.\nOn April 15, 1557 Velsius was expelled by the Council of Frankfurt.\n\nAugust 5, 1557 Velsius matriculated at Heidelberg, and obtained a license to give public lectures in philosophy. In June 1558 this license was revoked by the Senate of the University at the orders of Kurfürst Ottheinrich because he spread theses that were against the Holy Scriptures. Velsius attacked the pastor of the Heiliggeistkirche, Johann Flinner, on his position on the Eucharist, sent him a series of theses on new birth and free will, and accused the pastor of being a false apostle and misleader of the prince and people. In November 1559 he was also disallowed to give private lectures, after intervention of Kurfürst Friedrich III, and was expelled by the Senate of the University. Velsius shook the dust off his shoes as he left.\n\nIn 1560 Velsius was back in Frankfurt. He asked the council for permission to have a book printed he had written \"die Summa christlicher Lehre und Lebens\" (\"The Summary of Christian Doctrine and Life\"). The council referred his request to the Lutheran pastors, who on August 2, 1560 reported back that his book contained theses that were against orthodox doctrine. They also expressed concern that these doctrines could lead to unrest in the foreign churches in the city, as had happened in Münster. On March 18, 1561 the council ordered Velsius to leave the city, since he had his book printed without permission. The innkeeper where he was boarding, Hansen Braun, was told to no longer allow him to stay in his house.\n\nIn May 1561 Velsius was in Strasbourg. He wrote to Flinner (who had returned from Heidelberg) and the preachers, and to the council as well, submitting 20 propositions, probably the same ones as he announced in Heidelberg and in Frankfurt. These were not accepted, since they disagreed with the catechism then in use in Strasbourg.\n\nA month later, in June 1561, Velsius was in Basel. He was luckier there, at least he could count on Sebastian Castellio, with whom he had corresponded before, and advocates of tolerance such as Cellarius and Celio Secondo Curione. He submitted a summary to the Council of the University, who considered it on June 16. The council forwarded it to the Faculty of Theology, since it was outside their area of expertise. Cellarius proposed a number of theses for an academic disputation, but Velsius declined after the council had refused a public debate.\n\nOn June 25 Velsius departed for Zürich, where he arrived the next day. He wrote to the council, and Bullinger responded on behalf of the council, pointing out that his criticism didn't apply since it was directed at Luther and at the Roman Catholic Church. On July 4 Velsius had left town.\n\nOn August 1 Velsius was back in Heidelberg, where he wrote a last time to Bonifacius Amerbach and to Johannes Sturm. He matriculated in Marburg at the end of August 1561, where he lectured at the medical school. However, he remained only a few months in Marburg.\n\nIn 1563, Velsius had crossed the Channel to England where he joined the Dutch Church in London. Again he sought controversy, this time with Nicolaus Carinaeus, the minister of the Dutch refugee church, who had died from the plague the previous year. Carinaeus had explained his thoughts about regeneration through Christ. Velsius opposed him publicly developing at length his idea that the perfection of Adam could be reached on earth after inner rebirth had taken place in the individual. Velsius wrote a summary of his religion \"Christiani Hominis Norma\" (\"The Rule of a Christian Man\"), in which he explained his notion that through regeneration man could become God-in-man, like Christ. He sent copies of this pamphlet to the Bishop of London Edmund Grindal, to Secretary of State William Cecil, and to Queen Elizabeth. He also wrote a letter to the French Ambassador denouncing the vengeance of God on all who refused to receive his propositions. In his letter to the Queen, Velsius claimed to have confirmed his calling by performing miracles. The servant to the ambassador, Cosmus, fasted five or six days by Velsius' persuasion that after his abstinence he might receive \"illuminations a coelo\". According to Grindal in the end he fell mad, so neither of those miracles stood the test of further investigation. Bishop Grindal wrote a rebuttal, showing that Velsius' teachings were against orthodox doctrine. Velsius was summoned before the ecclesiastical commission, consisting of Bishop Grindal, the Bishop of Winchester Robert Horne, and the Dean of St. Paul's Alexander Nowell, who had a frank discussion with him, and charged him in the Queen's name to leave the kingdom. This he complained of in very rude words to the Queen, and predicted the death of the bishop of Winchester and other important public figures.\n\nVelsius returned to his native Holland, in April 1566 he was Groningen. In 1574 he was in prison there, presumably because of religious reasons. The authorities felt sorry for him, because he was an elderly gentleman, and apparently depressed. They therefore proposed to release him, also because of the hardship imprisonment caused him and his wife Grete Cassens, as they had to provide for his own cost of living. The proposal was considered by the Stadtholder de Robles, who had a conversation with Velsius, and referred it to the bishop, who charged the dean of the cathedral to look into it. On August 24, 1574 the bishop endorsed Velsius' release. However, Velsius refused to leave prison, because he only wanted to be released by God's grace, not by human intervention. This unusual situation lasted until May 1575, when de Robles required the jail to be vacated, since the adjacent castle had to be strengthened and readied for the garrison.\n\nIn April 1570 he was again in Cologne and then traveled through the Netherlands as a Protestant preacher. In 1578, 1580 and 1581 he was in Leiden. Place and year of death are unknown.\n\nVelsius published the Greek text of Proclus's \"De Motu\" (\"On Motion\"), along with a Latin translation.\n\nJustus Velsius is interesting because his life reflects so well the unsettled intellectual conditions of 16th-century Europe. His theological profile in the religious landscape is not clearly defined: first, he did not agree with Luther’s dogma of \"sola fide\" and instead held on to the free will of man; on the other hand, he supported the Lutheran Eucharist and rejected transubstantiation. Also, Velsius cannot be identified as Anabaptist, and is distinct from Spiritualism. What sets Velsius apart is that he taught justification by new birth, not by forgiveness of sins. He thought of himself as a messenger of God, sent to warn people for eternal damnation, and claimed to be able to confirm his teachings by miracles.\n\nIt has been suggested that Velsius may have known Servetus, since both were close to Vesalius. Velsius' position about predestination is reminiscent of Servetus', and it is noteworthy that the Calvin-Velsius disputation on this subject took place less than three years after Servetus was executed outside Geneva. Rembert suggests that Velsius may have known Flemish Anabaptist religious reformer Johann Campanus, or at the very least that they were aware of each other's work.\n\nVelsius' teachings appear to be related to those of the Family of Love. Velsius was a contemporary of Hendrik Niclaes, the founder of the Family of Love, and it seems likely that they may have known each other.\n\n\n"}

He is the leader of The People's Political Party.\n\nClarke advocates for comprehensive reform in the criminal justice system, to create a system which prevents recidivism among first-time offenders. He has proposed a program which he claims would reduce the recidivism which allegedly violent prison environments create: 'The Inmate Monitored Education System' otherwise known as T.I.M.E., which would aim to help eliminate the claimed harmful influence of prison life on first-time offenders.\n\nHe also campaigns strongly on the issues of poverty and homelessness.\n\nA former student teacher for Grade 5 at Chester Le Junior Public School in Scarborough in the 1980s, Clarke credits that period in his life as his most rewarding experience.\n\nClarke worked in the automobile business during the early 1990s. He sought election as Mayor of East York in the 1994 municipal election, describing himself as an \"advertising consultant, political rebel and welfare recipient\". He promised to resign after three months if elected, and to form a provincial party for ordinary people.\n\nClarke first campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1995 general election, challenging New Democratic Party Premier Bob Rae in York South. He received 170 votes, finishing seventh in a field of nine candidates. During this election, Clarke vowed to oppose the \"pimps\" of government who \"live off the avails of the people\".\n\nClarke campaigned for York South again in 1996 after Rae retired from the legislature, and finished last in a field of six candidates with 70 votes. The winner was Gerard Kennedy of the Ontario Liberal Party.\n\nHe sought election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1997 federal election, and finished sixth out of eight candidates in Broadview—Greenwood with 211 votes.

{"id": "9714027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9714027", "title": "Lelouch Lamperouge", "text": "Lelouch Lamperouge\n\n, whose alias is , is the title character and protagonist of the Sunrise anime series \"Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\". In the series, Lelouch is a former prince from the superpower Britannia who is given the power of the \"Geass\" by a witch known as C.C. Using the Geass and his genius-level intellect, Lelouch becomes the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights under his alter ego to destroy the Holy Britannian Empire, an imperial monarchy that has been conquering various countries under control from his father. His Japanese voice actor is Jun Fukuyama, and his child self is voiced by Sayaka Ohara. His English dub voice is provided by Johnny Yong Bosch with Michelle Ruff doing Lelouch's child voice.\n\nLelouch was designed by the group of manga artists Clamp, who aimed to create a stylish and visually appealing character. The character of Lelouch has been recognized as one of Japan's most popular characters during the time \"Code Geass\" aired, appearing at the top of several polls. Publications for anime and manga saw Lelouch as an interesting character. Despite his ruthless methods to destroy an empire, he still has several strong relationships that made him a likeable character. His voice actors Fukuyama and Bosch have been praised for their work as Lelouch's voice.\n\nWhile designing the concept art for Lelouch, the series' original character designers, Clamp, had initially conceived of his hair color as being white. Nanase Ohkawa, head writer at Clamp, said she had visualized him as being a character to which \"everyone\" could relate to as being \"cool\", literally, a \"beauty\". While developing the character during the initial planning stages, the series' core staff at Sunrise, director Gorō Taniguchi, writer Ichirō Ōkouchi, and the production team discussed numerous possible influences for the character with Clamp, such as the Japanese idol duos KinKi Kids and Tackey & Tsubasa.\n\nDuring the early planning stages for Lelouch's alter ego, \"Zero\", Clamp had wanted to create a mask never witnessed prior in any Sunrise series. Zero was one of the earliest developed characters. Ōkouchi wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series, because he felt that a mask was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show. In early designs of the character, Zero possessed long silver nails.\n\nLelouch is introduced in the first episode of the series as a student of Ashford Academy, where he is a member of its student council. He accidentally boards a truck used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding a witch known as C.C. (pronounced \"Cee Two\"), who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. offers him the \"Power of the King\", the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question. With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Britannian Empire, starting by killing his half-brother, Clovis la Britannia, after extracting information about the murder of his mother, Marianne. He takes up the identity of Zero and later forms the Order of the Black Knights, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.\n\nThe turning point in his rebellion comes when his half-sister, Euphemia li Britannia, declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her royal title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates without him knowing, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese causes Euphemia to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to spark the Black Rebellion, in which he declares Japan to be an independent nation and leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the better-organized Britannian military. Lelouch makes his way to Kamine Island to search for Nunnally, but is confronted by Suzaku. The second season reveals that Lelouch is defeated by Suzaku, who arrests his former friend and brings him to his father.\n\nAfter Suzaku brings Lelouch to Charles, he offers to hand him over on the condition he be inducted into the Knights of the Round, much to Lelouch's dismay. Charles agrees, and uses his Geass to alter Lelouch's mind. With this, Lelouch becomes the empire's slave, Julius Kingsley, wearing an eyepatch over his Geass.\n\nLelouch makes a few appearances in the miniseries, first seen in Suzaku's custody as he clutches his right eye while begging his friend for water, only to be silently turned down. In his second appearance upon arriving in St. Petersburg, Kingsley proudly declares that the Emperor has placed him in charge of all the Eastern front operational planning for Britannia's military.\n\nIn the third episode, Lelouch encounters Shin Hyuga Shaing and others for a meeting. In which he tries to arrest the others in his plan. Lelouch showcases a clip to create fear and havoc within the city. Later on, he plays chess along Hyuga, but starts hallucinating Kingsley and past memories from Rebellion. Later on Hyuga figures out that he was both Zero and Lelouch and calls his squad. Suzaku, in an attempt to defend the secret, kills most of the squad whilst Lelouch rips off his eye-patch. Eventually, both are captured, with Hyuga later declaring Kingsley executed and revealing that he is Zero.\n\nFrom here, Lelouch begins to regain his memories in a traumatized fashion, prompting Suzaku to strangle him, until Lelouch begins to cry and beg Suzaku to kill him. They are saved by Rolo Lamperouge, and from there Charles is forced to use his Geass on Lelouch again. This time, he is unaware of his royal heritage or being Zero, but still lives a life strikingly similar to the one he led at the start of the series.\n\nA year after the Black Rebellion, after the Emperor wiped out his memories, Lelouch is living as an Ashford student with\nRolo Lamperouge assigned to oversee the delusion under the guise of Lelouch's younger brother. Lelouch's memories are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights, gaining Rolo's trust in the process. When Nunnally is appointed as Governor of Area 11 and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan.\n\nThe Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins forging an alliance with the other world powers to create a force that rivals Britannia. He starts by destabilizing the Chinese Federation, returning control to Empress Tianzi from the High Eunuchs. Once Lelouch's new alliance, the United Federation of Nations, is formed, their first act is to liberate Japan. Despite Lelouch's desire to protect his sister, his Geass forces Suzaku to shoot a nuclear weapon, destroying a large portion of the Tokyo Settlement and presumably killing Nunnally. Schneizel then convinces the Black Knights to betray him with a despondent Lelouch willing to be killed by his former comrades, until Rolo sacrifices his life to save him. Lelouch decides to go to Kamine Island and defeat his father. Joined by Suzaku, he learns the truth that his mother faked her death and has been aiding the Emperor in their goal to wipe out individuality from the world. Lelouch, awakening his full Geass powers while rejecting the reality his parents intend, controls the will of the C's World entity itself to erase the Sword of Akasha and his parents out of existence. One month later, Lelouch usurps the Britannian throne and appoints Suzaku as his knight to set the stage for their ultimate plan, the Zero Requiem.\n\nAs Emperor, Lelouch dismantles the Britannian class system and frees every colony. He then requests that Britannia join the U.F.N, but proceeds to take the council members hostage after it is revealed that Britannia's large population would give him a majority voting block. This brings him into conflict with Schneizel, who has Nunnally in his custody and commands the \"Damocles\" (a floating fortress which he intends to place into a position which would allow him to fire nuclear weapons worldwide), and the Black Knights now under Kaname Oghi. In the final battle, as Suzaku fakes his death, Lelouch outwits Schneizel and places him under a Geass command to serve Zero. From there, learning that Nunnally has regained her sight and has been acting on her own plan to unite the world through the destruction of the \"Damocles\", Lelouch uses his Geass on her to give him the \"Damocles\"' key. With Schenizel and the \"Damocles\" both under his control, Lelouch declares himself the ruler of the world. Two months later, Lelouch arranges for the public execution of the Black Knight leaders and the U.F.N. representatives. It is then, as Nunnally, the U.F.N and the Black Knights learn afterwards, that the Zero Requiem's final phase takes place with Lelouch being killed by Suzaku in the guise of Zero. With his death, Nunnally succeeds her brother as Empress and the world unites in a new era of peace and cooperation. In the spinoff OVA, \"Miraculous Birthday\", he briefly uses his power in the afterlife to say goodbye to Suzaku, Nunnally, Rivalz, Nina, and Kallen before departing.\n\nIn \"Code Geass: Lost Colors\", the video game for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, there are a several different endings and clips of Lelouch that involve the main character, Rai who joins the same school. Across the game, the player can make Rai befriend Lelouch. Rai can also become Lelouch's best friend as well as Zero's partner. In the video game \"\", Lelouch makes an appearance in his Knightmare Frame, the \"Shinkirō\". He also appears in the spin-off with his \"Shinkiro\". Lelouch and the rest of the \"Code Geass\" R1 cast make their debut to the \"Super Robot Wars\" franchise in this game, using their R1 Knightmares.\n\nThe \"Code Geass\" manga follows the same basic plot as the anime, but with several differences. Knightmares do not exist. As for Lelouch's character, he is still the same as he was in the anime. He takes on the identity Zero, but largely focuses on his activities with the Black Knights.\n\n\"Nightmare of Nunnally\" features Lelouch's transformation into Zero by merging with C.C. This time the Geass grants Lelouch supernatural strength allowing him to battle the Knightmares in hand-to-hand combat. Surprisingly Lelouch knows the same martial arts as Suzaku. After several fights against Britannia, Zero orders the Black Knights to side with the army to defeat the Emperor as Euphemia is due to take over the empire. Once the Emperor is defeated, Zero's death is announced, as Lelouch inherits C.C.'s name and immortality, becoming C.C. The Demon King and goes forth to spread Geass and to promote conflict around the world.\n\nIn the manga \"Suzaku of the Counterattack\", Lelouch obtains his Geass in the same way as in the anime series, except that his Geass symbol is slightly rendered. Many of the Black Knights are not loyal to Zero and often split off into renegade factions or act without his knowledge. Lelouch is held responsible for a terrorist attack when a Black Knights faction had gone renegade without following his instructions. He later goes to kill his father only to discover that he was already killed by Schneizel, his half-brother; however, it is later revealed to be Schneizel's scheme to get Lelouch executed and to take C.C.'s Code. Near the end of the manga, Lelouch tries to use his Geass on Schneizel, but the latter punctures his left eye, leaving him never to use his Geass again.\n\nIn \"Tales of an Alternate Shogunate\", set in 1853 at the Bakumatsu Era, Lelouch is the commander of the military counterinsurgence brigade known as the Shinsengumi, formed under the orders of the Shogunate to fight the rebel group known as the Black Revolutionaries, but was secretly the leader of that group as Zero and has gained information from within. The event is set in Kyoto, and Lelouch had recently acquired his geass from C.C. and had stolen Britannian's new Knightmare, Gawain.\n\nIn a special \"Code Geass\" Picture Drama episode, Lelouch appears on December 5 for Ashford Academy's school festival, helping Rivalz, now school president, along with some of his friends. However a battle erupts in school grounds by the Neo-Chinese Federation, led by a former eunuch, whom takes everyone hostage. With help of his friends, Lelouch manages to stop the Federation soldiers. In the aftermath, the entire episode is revealed to be a dream which the ghost of Lelouch used to thank everyone. In a special OVA parody episode, based on the \"Alice in Wonderland\" story, Lelouch is narrating the story and appears in the role as the Mad Hatter. \n\nLelouch vi Britannia is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire. He was seventeenth in line to the Imperial throne prior to his mother's assassination, an event which also left his sister blind and crippled. His father banished him and his sister Nunnally to Japan, where they were used as political tools. It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, who would later become his best friend.\n\nHis mother's death and his father's apparent unconcern about it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all. Lelouch is an individual who is calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. At school, Lelouch conducts himself as a sociable, likeable, and often easy-going student; however, in reality, this is a mask to hide his true nature. As Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.\n\nLelouch possesses very strong philosophical beliefs, which define both his actions and his motivations. Perhaps his most notable is that he rejects his father's beliefs of Social Darwinism. He believes the world can live in cooperation rather than through conflict and struggle. To achieve this aim, he believes that the ends justify the means; he is willing to commit acts of evil if it means bringing down a greater evil in the process, and is always focused on getting results regardless of the methods used. Lelouch also has strong beliefs concerning death and killing, thinking that one should only kill if they are prepared to die themselves.\n\nLelouch's Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him \"the power of absolute obedience\", allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact, similar to extreme hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of anyone he makes eye contact with. The people under this power obey whatever orders Lelouch gives them. Once it is cast, the orders can neither be changed or canceled, nor are the subjects capable of resisting them. Also, Lelouch can only cast Geass on a person once; afterward, once its conditions have been fulfilled, Lelouch's power won't work on them anymore, unless their initial Geass has been removed by a Geass canceler.\n\nEven without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. By using his genius intellect, he is capable of devising and executing strategies with fantastic speed and precision. He rarely battles opponents physically. Instead, he usually attacks with coordinated groups or armies focused under his direct command, or using clever plots, schemes, or deceptions to gain an advantage. He thinks of his battles as chess games, at which he is a masterful player, always beating anyone who played against him. Before he received his Geass power, he often gambles on his chess games against Britannian nobles and other skilled players out of boredom. As a teenager, he makes use of his masterful skills as a commander in real battle, anticipating his enemies' moves and giving orders on how to respond to his forces, and utilizing traps and schemes that were strategically put in place to destroy the enemy. In contrast, his physical state is poor; however, he displays above-average hand–eye coordination, both with firearms and the keyboard-based control system of the \"Shinkirō\". Lelouch is also shown to be very charismatic and persuasive, able to win the support of the populace through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles through superior strategic planning. In episode 14 of R2, V.V. remarks that Lelouch is a lot like his father.\nLelouch usually operates standard Knightmares, but pilots such as Suzaku and Cornelia, both of whom are masterful pilots who use more advanced models, are commonly able to overwhelm him in single combat. Lelouch is typically accompanied by Kallen, who serves as his personal guard. After stealing the advanced model, the \"Gawain\", Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight, until it was lost in the ocean, when trying to deal with Jeremiah. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the \"Shinkirō\", which has the strongest defense of any Knightmare, but it requires an intellect of his level to perform the complex calculations needed for it to be effective.\n\nLelouch's character has been well received by viewers of the series, appearing in various anime polls. Lelouch was chosen as the most popular male character of 2006, 2007 and 2008 at Animage magazine and \"Newtype\" magazine named him the best anime male character of the decade. He was chosen the most popular male character of 2006, 2007, and 2008 at \"Animage\" magazine's annual Anime Grand Prix. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2008, Lelouch was nominated as one of the best male characters. In 2014, NTT customers voted him as their 13th favorite black haired male anime character. His voice actor Jun Fukuyama also won the \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\" award for his portrayal of the character at the first Seiyu Awards in 2007. Fukuyama's work as Lelouch's voice actor also lead him to win the Tokyo International Anime Fair in the category \"Best Voice Actor\".\n\nCritics for anime and manga series have also commented on Lelouch's character. Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger stated that Lelouch \"is hard to like\" because of his narcissistic personality, but noted that his bonds with Nunnally and his friends make up for that. Bamboo Dong from the site agreed with Kimlinger, though noted that Lelouch' made the character interesting to watch. Gia Manry from the same site listed Suzaku and him as the third best \"frenemies\" in anime due to how their friendship falls apart as a result of their rivalry. Mostly positive response were given by Danielle Van Gorder from Mania Entertainment due to Lelouch's differences from most of anime's protagonists and how his double life as a Zero and as a student is shown across the series. Chris Beveridge from the same site praised Lelouch's actions in \"R2\" when he becomes Britannia's Emperor, describing him as \"the classic angle of the villain with good motives\" because of the dangerous actions he does for a greater good. Beveridge also commented on his confrontations with Scheizel and Nunnally, mentioning the rivalry across the series in the former and citing the latter as heartbreaking.\n\nIGN compared him with Light Yagami from the \"Death Note\" series, due to his double life and his questionable methods, respectively. The double life aspect has also been praised due to how such change also differentiates the show's tone from a high school comedy to an action show, and how he \"winds-up\" between his two selves. Moreover, his reasons for evil actions have also been found to help viewers to like the character. Also from IGN, Ramsey Isler found Lelouch's double life trait as rather comical as after short prologue of his role as Zero in an episode, he is seen doing homework at school for being absent to classes. Kevin Leathers from UK Anime Network enjoyed Lelouch's personality as his cold persona made the series \"refreshing\" from other mecha anime. Lelouch is ranked 23rd on IGN's 2009 list of best anime characters of all time, and 18th on IGN's 2014 list.\n"}

She had never shown support for the witch trials, since she did not believe witches or warlocks existed. She was outspoken in her belief that the accusers were lying, and upon hearing this, two young girls Ann Putnam Jr. and Mercy Lewis promptly accused her of witchcraft.\n\nShe was unaware of the level of paranoia in the village, and when she went to trial, she was simply truthful about her innocence and never doubted she would be exonerated. As the girls testified against her during examination, Corey asked the judge not to believe the rantings of hysterical children. The girls began mimicking her movements as if they were being controlled by her. Mercy Lewis called out, \"There's a man he whispered in her ear.\" John Hathorne asked Lewis if the man was Satan, then shortly Ann Putnam Jr. cried out that Martha Corey had a yellow bird sucking on her hand, which was enough evidence to persuade the jury of her guilt. She was hanged on September 22, 1692. She was 72 years old.\n\nHer husband, Giles, defended her against the allegations, and in due time he was also accused of witchcraft himself. He refused to undergo a trial and was executed by pressing, a slow crushing death under a pile of stones. The main reason usually cited for his refusal to be tried or to say yea or nay was to keep his estate from being confiscated from his heirs. When the sheriff asked how he would plead, he responded only by asking for more weight. He died on September 19, 1692, three days before his wife Martha was hanged. Since he had not been convicted, his estate passed, in accordance with his last will and testament, to those of his children who had maintained that he was innocent.\n\nCorey and her husband are both characters in the Arthur Miller play \"The Crucible\" (although Martha is only heard off-stage). In the 1957 and 1996 film adaptations of Miller's play, she was depicted (on-screen) by Jeanne Fusier-Gir and Mary Pat Gleason, respectively.\n\n\n"}

He played in 344 games during his four-year career with the Boston Beaneaters, 337 of them as their catcher. Bergen helped the Beaneaters to two straight National League pennants ( and ) and a second-place finish in 1899.\n\nA 2001 article about him described him as \"a nimble fielder with a bullwhip arm who could snap the ball to second base without so much as moving his feet\". In 1900, future Hall of Fame outfielder Jesse Burkett characterized Bergen as the best catcher in baseball history.\n\nBergen suffered from apparent mental illness. By 1899, he experienced hallucinations, had to be removed from a game due to odd behavior, and walked off from the team train during a trip to Boston. On January 19, 1900, he killed his wife (the former Hattie Gaines), and two children, then took his own life. Despite this, and the brevity of his career, he received one vote in both 1938 and 1939 to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, Bergen attracted attention while playing for a series of teams from 1892 to 1895. But his behavior was mercurial. Batting .372, Bergen left the Kansas City Blues suddenly in 1895 over a perceived slight, and never again played for the team. Boston had scouted him, and was quick to purchase his contract for $1,000.\n\nWithin a year, Bergen had established a reputation for throwing out baserunners. Bergen played in 344 major league games for the Beaneaters teams, who won two straight National League pennants (1897–1898), and finished in second place in 1899. As a catcher, he had mixed results, as exemplified by the 1898 season. On the plus side, he had a Range factor of 5.17 in 1898—well above the league average of 4.60 for catchers. However, Bergen also led the league's catchers with 24 errors and 38 passed balls. He had a career batting average of .258 with 69 extra base hits and 176 RBIs.\n\nFuture Hall of Famer Jesse Burkett enthusiastically described Bergen's skills in 1900: \"As a catcher, Martin Bergen was the best the world ever produced. No man acted with more natural grace as a ballplayer. There was finish in every move he made. His eye was always true, and his movements so quick and accurate in throwing that the speediest base runners ... never took chances when Bergen was behind the bat.\"\n\nBergen's teammates appreciated his strong arm and hustling style of play, but relations between the catcher and the team soured following an altercation with Vic Willis in which Bergen inexplicably slapped him while eating breakfast. The team's mixed emotions were expressed by an anonymous Boston player quoted in the press: \"He has made trouble with a good many of the boys and we just give him a wide berth. But he's a ballplayer, and once we get into a game, personal feelings are set aside in admiration of the artist, for such he is.\"\n\nBergen's condition worsened in 1899, which led to internal turmoil for the Beaneaters. He was having hallucinations that enemies were trying to poison him. His son died in April, and Bergen imagined that his teammates were making jokes behind his back about the death. He began sitting in particular positions, and walking sideways, so that he could spot assassins approaching from either side of him. Boston's team president urged the other players to avoid Bergen, fearing what he might do. Some blamed his condition on heavy drink, but Bergen was regarded by others as a teetotaler.\n\nIn mid-July 1899, Bergen silently walked off the team's train at the beginning of a road trip, leaving Boston with just a backup catcher during a heated pennant race. However, he was lustily cheered by fans upon his return to the team. In September, Bergen disappeared again for a few days, then showed up unannounced a few minutes before a game and put on his catching gear without speaking to anyone. On October 9, Bergen had to be removed from a game when he dodged the pitches rather than catching them, because he was preoccupied with avoiding knife thrusts from an invisible assailant. Bergen was aware of his mental state, and actively sought help from both clergy and physicians. However, he refused to take any of the bromides prescribed by his doctor, explaining, \"I thought someone in the National League had found out that you were my family physician and had arranged to give me some poison. I did not take it from my wife because I didn't wish hers to be the hand that poisoned me.\"\n\nOne book on Boston baseball history recounts that after his son's death, Bergen \"would catch a few games, then ask manager Frank Selee if he could return home for a few days.\" When Selee refused permission, Bergen would go home anyway. Bergen complained that players kept reminding him of his son who had died, and he resented a $300 fine imposed for being AWOL. \"Black moods came on Bergen who seemed to be happy only when on his farm in North Brookfield.\" Several players said they would not return to the Beaneaters in 1900 if the increasingly erratic Bergen was still with the club. There were also reports that Bergen had suffered a career-ending broken hip during a game in the 1899 season.\n\nIn January 1900, at his home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, the 28-year-old Bergen ended his life in murder-suicide. Neighbors expressed shock and said they saw no warning signs. Several had seen him before the tragedy unfolded, and recalled him as \"unusually cheerful\" and \"pleasant\" when conversing with them. The neighbors also told reporters how devoted he always seemed to his wife. The medical examiner reported that Bergen killed his wife and two children with an axe, then used a straight razor to cut his own throat with such force that he nearly beheaded himself. Bergen's father discovered the bodies. According to an article from \"The New York Times\" reporting on the tragedy:\nThe little boy (Bergen's 3-year-old son) was lying on the floor with a large wound in the head. Mrs. Bergen's skull was terribly crushed, having evidently been struck more than one blow by the infuriated husband. The appearance of the little girl (his 6-year-old daughter found on the kitchen floor next to Bergen) also showed that a number of savage blows had been rained upon the top and side of her head. Bergen's throat had been cut with a razor, and the head was nearly severed.\nBergen's behavior had been known to the press, which suppressed much of it. Following his death, they reported that he had been subject to \"fits of melancholy\" and had \"showed signs of insanity\" in the fall of 1899. After examining contemporary accounts, the Harvard Medical School's Dr. Carl Salzman felt that Bergen was likely a schizophrenic with possible manic depression.\n\nIn 1934, Connie Mack and George M. Cohan, both of whom had ties to North Brookfield, helped raise funds to erect a granite memorial to Bergen. The inscription on the monument at Bergen's gravesite at St. Joseph's Cemetery on Bell Street read: \"In memory of Martin Bergen, 1871–1900. Member of the Boston National League Club. Erected in appreciation of his contribution to American's national game.\"\n\nMarty Bergen's brother, Bill Bergen, was a major league catcher as well, playing for the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Superbas from to .\n\n\n"}

She was successful as a tango singer, performing on numerous radio shows and performed \"canción criolla\". Her film career began in 1940. She was blacklisted after the ouster of Juan Perón for having sung his anthem, \"Soy La Descamisada\" and did not work again until the 1970s. From her comeback in 1972, she remained an active performer until her death.\n\nNilda Elvira Vattuone Pesoa was born in Bonifacio a small town in the Guaminí subdivision of, Buenos Aires on 10 September 1911 to Marcos Vattuone and Salustiana Pesoa. Her father died while she was quite young and the family moved to Buenos Aires, for better work prospects. Nelly began working in a textile factory at age 12. From the age of 13, she dreamed of becoming a pilot and went to flight school. It was there that she met Eva Duarte, who also had aspirations of becoming an aviator.\n\nIn 1924, Omar began singing tango professionally. Ignacio Corsini gave her her big break into singing when he heard her and hired her for his radio shows. She sang with the ensemble \"Cenizas del fogón\" under the direction of José Luis Suilas. Between 1932 and 1933, Radio Stentor broadcast duets of Omar and her sister. When she was hired by Radio Belgrano she worked with some of the most famous tango poets, Enrique Cadícamo and Homero Manzi, as well as some of the most famous singers then working, Libertad Lamarque and Agustín Magaldi. Homero Manzi wrote at least three tangos for Omar: \"Solamente ella\", \"Ninguna\" and \"Sur\". She had a clear voice with firm phrasing and reached the height of her fame in the 1940s and 1950s. Trademark tangos, which remain associated with her are \"Amar y callar\", \"Del tiempo de la morocha\", \"Manoblanca\", \"Nobleza de arrabal\" and \"Tu vuelta Sur\". She also performed in the canción criolla genre, which had been all but forgotten.\n\nIn 1946, Omar recorded her first album, accompanied by Francisco Canaro’s orchestra, on the Odeón label. In 1951 she was signed by RCA Victor, and recorded a 78 rpm album with Domingo Farafiotti’s orchestra. In 1955, she traveled to Montevideo, Uruguay and appeared in a stage production and then moved to Venezuela for a year, before returning to Argentina. She retired from singing upon her return until her comeback in 1972.\n\nIn 1945, Omar sang an anthem, a milonga, \"Soy La Descamisada\", which was created for the political campaign of Juan Perón. She wholeheartedly supported Perón and when he was ousted in 1955, she was blacklisted from the entertainment industry for 17 years. She made only three films prior to 1955, including \"Canto de amor\" (1940), directed by Julio Irigoyen, which also starred the singer Carlos Viván. It is believed that all copies of the film were destroyed; however, the Argentine film archives has photographs taken during filming.\n\nIn 1942, she filmed \"Melodías de América\" with Eduardo Morera. Though she is not listed in the cast roster, she is documented in a cast photo of the film. In 1951, she dubbed the singing voice of Mecha Ortiz in the film \"Mi vida por la tuya\". She would not make another film for 57 years, but in 2008, she worked on a documentary about tango entitled \"Café de los maestros\" under the direction of Miguel Kohan.\n\nIn 1972, she staged a singing comeback accompanied by guitarist José Canet, who convinced her to come out of retirement.

He obtained his clinical experience at St Thomas' Hospital.\n\nFenwick is a senior lecturer at King's College, London, where he works as a consultant at the Institute of Psychiatry. He is the Consultant Neuropsychologist at both the Maudsley, and John Radcliffe hospitals, and also provides services for Broadmoor Hospital. He works with the Mental Health Group at the University of Southampton, and holds a visiting professorship at the Riken Neurosciences Institute in Japan.\n\nFenwick is the president of the Horizon Research Foundation, an organisation that supports research into end-of-life experiences. He is the President of the British branch of the International Association for Near-Death Studies.\n\nFenwick has been part of the editorial board for a number of journals, including the \"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry\", the \"Journal of Consciousness Studies\" and the \"Journal of Epilepsy and Behaviour\".\n\nFenwick's interest in near-death experiences was piqued when he read Raymond Moody's book \"Life After Life\". Initially skeptical of Moody's anecdotal evidence, Fenwick reassessed his opinion after a discussion with one of his own patients, who described a near-death experience very similar to that of Moody's subjects. Since then, he has collected and analysed more than 300 examples of near-death experiences.\n\nHe has been criticised by the medical community for claiming that human consciousness can survive bodily death. Fenwick argues that human consciousness may be more than just a function of the brain.\n\n\"The plain fact is that none of us understands these phenomena.

The Fenwicks argue that modern medical practices have devalued end-of-life experiences, and call for a more holistic approach to death and dying. In 2003, Fenwick and Sam Parnia appeared in the BBC documentary \"The Day I Died\". In the documentary Parnia and Fenwick discussed their belief that research from near-death experiences indicates the mind is independent of the brain. According to Susan Blackmore the documentary misled viewers with beliefs that are rejected by the majority of scientists. Blackmore criticized the documentary for biased and \"dishonest reporting\", particularly in respect to the theory of consciousness proposed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, which Blackmore herself presented as a theory long ago subjected to \"the most devastating critique\" by philosophers Rick Grush and Patricia Churchland, who, according to Blackmore, took Penrose & Hameroff's \"argument step by step, and demolish(ed) each one\". However, Blackmore failed to mention the existence of a reply by Penrose and Hameroff, in which Grush and Churchland’s arguments are demonstrated to be misleading and with respect to the physiological evidence factually incorrect.\n\nFenwick and Parnia have claimed that research from NDEs may show the \"mind is still there after the brain is dead\". The neurologist Michael O'Brien has written \"most people would not find it necessary to postulate such a separation between mind and brain to explain the events,\" and suggested that further research is likely to provide a physical explanation for near-death experiences. Robert Todd Carroll has written that Fenwick has made metaphysical assumptions and dismissed possible psychological and physiological explanations for near-death experiences.\n\n\nFenwick's interests include hill-walking and fishing.

{"id": "3501153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3501153", "title": "Religious skepticism", "text": "Religious skepticism\n\nReligious skepticism is a type of skepticism relating to religion. Religious skeptics question religious authority and are not necessarily anti-religious but skeptical of specific or all religious beliefs and/or practices. Socrates was one of the most prominent and first religious skeptics of whom there are records; he questioned the legitimacy of the beliefs of his time in the existence of the Greek gods. Religious skepticism is not the same as atheism or agnosticism and some religious skeptics are deists.\n\nThe word skeptic (sometimes sceptic) is derived from the middle French \"sceptique\" or the Latin \"scepticus\", literally \"sect of the sceptics\". Its origin is in the Greek \"skeptikos\", meaning inquiring, reflective or one that doubts. As such, religious skepticism generally refers to doubting or questioning something about religion. Although, as noted by Schellenberg the term is sometimes more generally applied to anyone that has a negative view of religion.\n\nThe earliest beginnings of religious skepticism can be traced back to Xenophanes. He critiqued popular religion of his time, particularly false conceptions of the divine that are a byproduct of the human propensity to anthropomorphize deities. He took the scripture of his time to task for painting the gods in a negative light and promoted a more rational view of religion. He was very critical of religious people privileging their belief system over others without sound reason\n\nThe majority of skeptics are agnostics and atheists but there are also a number of religious people that are skeptical of religion. The religious are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some stated belief. Some philosophers put forth the sheer diversity of religion as a justification for skepticism by theists and non-theists alike. Theists are also generally skeptical of the claims put forth by atheists.\n\nMichael Shermer wrote that religious skepticism is a process for discovering the truth rather than general non-acceptance. For this reason a religious skeptic might believe that Jesus existed while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles (see historicity of Jesus). Thomas Jefferson's \"The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth\", a literal cut and paste of the New Testament that removes anything supernatural, is a prominent example.\n\nThe term has morphed into one that typically emphasizes scientific and historical methods of evidence. There are some skeptics that question whether religion is a viable topic for criticism given that it doesn't require proof for belief. Others, however, insist it is as much as any other knowledge. Especially when it makes claims that contradict those made by science.\n\nThere has been much work since the late 20th century by philosophers such as Schellenburg and Moser and both have written numerous books pertaining to the topic. Much of their work has focused on defining what religion is and specifically what people are skeptical of about it. The work of others have argued for the viability of religious skepticism by appeal to higher-order evidence (evidence about our evidence and our capacities for evaluation), what some call meta-evidence.\n\nThere are still echos of early Greek skepticism in the way some current thinkers question the intellectual viability of belief in the divine.\n\nIn modern times there is a certain amount of mistrust and lack of acceptance of religious skeptics, particularly towards those that are also atheists. This is coupled with concerns many skeptics have about the government in countries, such as the U.S.A., where separation of church and state are central tenants.\n\nSocrates was raised in polytheistic society in which the gods were not omnipotent and required sacrifice and ritual. Socrates' conception of the divine was that they always benevolent, truthful, authoritative, and wise. Divinity was to operate within the standards of rationality. This critique ultimately resulted in his trial for impiety and corruption as documented in The Apology.\n\nIn ancient India, there was a materialist philosophical school called the Cārvāka, who were known as being skeptical of the religious claims of Vedic religion, its rituals and texts.\n\nThe historian Will Durant writes that Plato was \"as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma.\"\n\nDemocritus was the father of Materialism and there is no trace of a belief in afterlife in his work. Specifically in \"Those in Hades\" he refers to constituents of the soul as atoms that dissolve upon death.\n\nIn De Natura Deorum the Roman statesman Cicero calls into question the character of the gods, whether or not they participate in earthly affairs, and questions their existence. This a significant evolution from his earlier writings wherein he was more accommodating to religion\n\nIn the poem De rerum natura Lucretius introduces epicurean philosophy to the Romans and proclaims that the universe operates according to physical principles and guided by \"fortuna\", or chance, instead of the Roman gods.\n\nThomas Hobbes took positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings. He argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that \"though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity\".\n\nVoltaire, although himself a deist, was a forceful critic of religion and advocated for acceptance of all religions as well as separation of church and state.\n\n"}
{"id": "26232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26232", "title": "Ruhollah Khomeini", "text": "Ruhollah Khomeini\n\nSayyid Ruhollah Mūsavi Khomeini ( ; 24 September 1902 – 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian politician and \"marja\". He was the founder of the Islamic republic of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the end of 2,500 years of Persian monarchy. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei on 4 June 1989.\n\nKhomeini was born in 1902 in Khomeyn, in what is now Iran's Markazi Province. His father was murdered in 1903 when Khomeini was six months old. He began studying the Quran and the Persian language from a young age and was assisted in his religious studies by his relatives, including his mother's cousin and older brother.\n\nKhomeini was a \"marja\" (\"source of emulation\") in Twelver Shia Islam, a Mujtahid or \"faqih\" (an expert in Sharia) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the theory of \"welayat-el faqih\", the \"Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority)\", to include theocratic . This principle (though not known to the wider public before the revolution), was appended to the new Iranian constitution after being put to a referendum. According to \"The New York Times\", Khomeini called democracy the equivalent of prostitution. Whether Khomeini's ideas are compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be democratic is disputed. He was \"Time\" magazine's Man of the Year in 1979 for his international influence, and Khomeini has been described as the \"virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\". In 1982, he survived one military coup attempt. Khomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis, his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, and for referring to the United States as the \"Great Satan\" and Soviet Union as the \"Lesser Satan.\" Khomeini has been criticized for these acts and for human rights violations of Iranians (including his ordering of execution of thousands of political prisoners, war criminals and prisoners of the Iran–Iraq War).\n\nHe has also been lauded as a \"charismatic leader of immense popularity\", a \"champion of Islamic revival\" by Shia scholars, who attempted to establish good relations between Sunnis and Shias, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini held the title of Grand Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. He is generally referred to as Ayatollah Khomeini by others. In Iran, his gold-domed tomb in Tehrān's Behesht-e Zahrāʾ cemetery has become a shrine for his adherents, and he is legally considered \"inviolable\", with Iranians regularly punished for insulting him.\n\nRuhollah Khomeini's ancestors migrated towards the end of the 18th century from their original home in Nishapur, Khorasan Province, in northeastern part of Iran, for a short stay, to the kingdom of Awadh – a region in the modern state of Uttar Pradesh, India – whose rulers were Twelver Shia Muslims of Persian origin. During their rule they extensively invited, and received, a steady stream of Persian scholars, poets, jurists, architects, and painters. The family eventually settled in the small town of Kintoor, near Lucknow, the capital of Awadh. Ayatollah Khomeini's paternal grandfather, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, was born in Kintoor. He left Lucknow in 1830, on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Imam Ali in Najaf, Ottoman Iraq (now Iraq) and never returned. According to Moin, this migration was to escape from the spread of British power in India. In 1834 Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi visited Persia, and in 1839 he settled in Khomein. Although he stayed and settled in Iran, he continued to be known as \"Hindi\", indicating his stay in India, and Ruhollah Khomeini even used \"Hindi\" as a pen name in some of his ghazals. There are also claims that Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi departed from Kashmir, instead of Lucknow.\n\nRuhollah Musavi Khomeini, whose first name means \"spirit of Allah\", was born on 24 September 1902 in Khomeyn, Markazi Province. He was raised by his mother, Hajieh Agha Khanum, and his aunt, Sahebeth, following the murder of his father, Seyyed Mostafa Hendi, five months after his birth in 1903.\n\nRuhollah began to study the Qur'an and elementary Persian at the age of six. The following year, he began to attend a local school, where he learned religion, \"noheh khani\" (lamentation recital), and other traditional subjects. Throughout his childhood, he continued his religious education with the assistance of his relatives, including his mother's cousin, Ja'far, and his elder brother, Morteza Pasandideh.\n\nAfter World War I arrangements were made for him to study at the Islamic seminary in Esfahan, but he was attracted instead to the seminary in Arak. He was placed under the leadership of Ayatollah Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi. In 1920, Khomeini moved to Arak and commenced his studies. The following year, Ayatollah Haeri Yazdi transferred to the Islamic seminary in the holy city of Qom, southwest of Tehran, and invited his students to follow. Khomeini accepted the invitation, moved, and took up residence at the Dar al-Shafa school in Qom. Khomeini's studies included Islamic law (\"sharia\") and jurisprudence (\"fiqh\"), but by that time, Khomeini had also acquired an interest in poetry and philosophy (\"irfan\"). So, upon arriving in Qom, Khomeini sought the guidance of Mirza Ali Akbar Yazdi, a scholar of philosophy and mysticism. Yazdi died in 1924, but Khomeini continued to pursue his interest in philosophy with two other teachers, Javad Aqa Maleki Tabrizi and Rafi'i Qazvini. However, perhaps Khomeini's biggest influences were another teacher, Mirza Muhammad 'Ali Shahabadi, and a variety of historic Sufi mystics, including Mulla Sadra and Ibn Arabi.\n\nKhomeini studied Greek philosophy and was influenced by both the philosophy of Aristotle, whom he regarded as the founder of logic, and Plato, whose views \"in the field of divinity\" he regarded as \"grave and solid\". Among Islamic philosophers, Khomeini was mainly influenced by Avicenna and Mulla Sadra.\nApart from philosophy, Khomeini was interested in literature and poetry. His poetry collection was released after his death. Beginning in his adolescent years, Khomeini composed mystic, political and social poetry. His poetry works were published in three collections: \"The Confidant,\" \"The Decanter of Love and Turning Point\", and \"Divan\". His knowledge of poetry is further attested by the modern poet Nader Naderpour (1929–2000), who \"had spent many hours exchanging poems with Khomeini in the early 1960\". Naderpour remembered: \"For four hours we recited poetry. Every single line I recited from any poet, he recited the next.\"\n\nRuhollah Khomeini was a lecturer at Najaf and Qom seminaries for decades before he was known on the political scene. He soon became a leading scholar of Shia Islam. He taught political philosophy, Islamic history and ethics. Several of his students – for example, Morteza Motahhari – later became leading Islamic philosophers and also \"marja'\". As a scholar and teacher, Khomeini produced numerous writings on Islamic philosophy, law, and ethics. He showed an exceptional interest in subjects like philosophy and mysticism that not only were usually absent from the curriculum of seminaries but were often an object of hostility and suspicion.\n\nInaugurating his teaching career at the age of 27 by giving private lessons on irfan and Mulla Sadra to a private circle, around the same time, in 1928, he also released his first publication, \"Sharh Du'a al-Sahar\" (Commentary on the Du'a al-Baha), \"a detailed commentary, in Arabic, on the prayer recited before dawn during Ramadan by Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq\", followed, some years later, by \"Sirr al-Salat\" (Secret of the Prayer), where \"the symbolic dimensions and inner meaning of every part of the prayer, from the ablution that precedes it to the salam that concludes it, are expounded in a rich, complex, and eloquent language that owes much to the concepts and terminology of Ibn 'Arabi. As Sayyid Fihri, the editor and translator of \"Sirr al-Salat\", has remarked, the work is addressed only to the foremost among the spiritual elite (akhass-i khavass) and establishes its author as one of their number.\" The second book has been translated by Sayyid Amjad Hussain Shah Naqavi and released by BRILL in 2015, under the title \"The Mystery of Prayer: The Ascension of the Wayfarers and the Prayer of the Gnostics\".\n\nHis seminary teaching often focused on the importance of religion to practical social and political issues of the day, and he worked against secularism in the 1940s. His first political book, \"Kashf al-Asrar\" (Uncovering of Secrets) published in 1942, was a point-by-point refutation of \"Asrar-e hazar salih\" (Secrets of a Thousand Years), a tract written by a disciple of Iran's leading anti-clerical historian, Ahmad Kasravi, as well as a condemnation of innovations such as international time zones, \n\nMost Iranians had a deep respect for the Shi'a clergy or Ulama, and tended to be religious, traditional, and alienated from the process of Westernization pursued by the Shah. In the late 19th century the clergy had shown themselves to be a powerful political force in Iran initiating the Tobacco Protest against a concession to a foreign (British) interest.\n\nAt the age of 61, Khomeini found the arena of leadership open following the deaths of Ayatollah Sayyed Husayn Borujerdi (1961), the leading, although quiescent, Shi'ah religious leader; and Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani (1962), an activist cleric. The clerical class had been on the defensive ever since the 1920s when the secular, anti-clerical modernizer Reza Shah Pahlavi rose to power. Reza's son Mohammad Reza Shah, instituted a \"White Revolution\", which was a further challenge to the Ulama.\n\nIn January 1963, the Shah announced the \"White Revolution\", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as \"an attack on Islam\"). Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.\n\nKhomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.\nOn the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \"wretched, miserable man,\" and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.\n\nOn 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. Following this action, there were three days of major riots throughout Iran and the deaths of some 400 people. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August.\n\nOn 26 October 1964, Khomeini denounced both the Shah and the United States. This time it was in response to the \"capitulations\" or diplomatic immunity granted by the Shah to American military personnel in Iran. The \"capitulation\" law (or \"status-of-forces agreement\") allowed members of the U.S. armed forces in Iran to be tried in their own military courts. Khomeini was arrested in November 1964 and held for half a year. Upon his release, he was brought before Prime Minister Hasan Ali Mansur, who tried to convince Khomeini that he should apologize and drop his opposition to the government. When Khomeini refused, Mansur slapped Khomeini's face in a fit of rage. Two months later, Mansur was assassinated on his way to parliament. Four members of the Fadayan-e Islam were later executed for the murder.\n\nKhomeini spent more than 14 years in exile, mostly in the holy Iraqi city of Najaf. Initially, he was sent to Turkey on 4 November 1964 where he stayed in the city of Bursa hosted by a colonel in the Turkish Military Intelligence named Ali Cetiner in his own residence. In October 1965, after less than a year, he was allowed to move to Najaf, Iraq, where he stayed until 1978, when he was expelled by then-Vice President Saddam Hussein. By this time discontent with the Shah was becoming intense and Khomeini visited Neauphle-le-Château, a suburb of Paris, France on a tourist visa on 6 October 1978.\nBy the late 1960s, Khomeini was a marja-e taqlid (model for imitation) for \"hundreds of thousands\" of Shia, one of six or so models in the Shia world. While in the 1940s Khomeini accepted the idea of a limited monarchy under the Iranian Constitution of 1906–07 – as evidenced by his book \"Kashf al-Asrar\" – by the 1970s he had rejected the idea. In early 1970, Khomeini gave a series of lectures in Najaf on Islamic government, later published as a book titled variously \"Islamic Government\" or \"\" (\"Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e faqih\").\n\nThis was his best known and most influential work, and laid out his ideas on governance (at that time):\n\nA modified form of this \"wilayat al-faqih\" system was adopted after Khomeini and his followers took power, and Khomeini was the Islamic Republic's first \"Guardian\" or \"Supreme Leader\". In the meantime, however, Khomeini was careful not to publicize his ideas for clerical rule outside of his Islamic network of opposition to the Shah which he worked to build and strengthen over the next decade. In Iran, a number of actions of the Shah including his repression of opponents began to build opposition to his regime.\n\nCassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah as (for example) \"the Jewish agent, the American serpent whose head must be smashed with a stone\", became common items in the markets of Iran, helped to demythologize the power and dignity of the Shah and his reign. Aware of the importance of broadening his base, Khomeini reached out to Islamic reformist and secular enemies of the Shah, despite his long-term ideological incompatibility with them.\n\nAfter the 1977 death of Ali Shariati (an Islamic reformist and political revolutionary author/academic/philosopher who greatly assisted the Islamic revival among young educated Iranians), Khomeini became the most influential leader of the opposition to the Shah. Adding to his mystique was the circulation among Iranians in the 1970s of an old Shia saying attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kadhem. Prior to his death in 799, al-Kadhem was said to have prophesied that \"A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path\". In late 1978, a rumour swept the country that Khomeini's face could be seen in the full moon. Millions of people were said to have seen it and the event was celebrated in thousands of mosques. He was perceived by many Iranians as the spiritual as well as political leader of the revolt. Additionally, the episode with Khomeini's face in the moon showed that in late 1978 he was increasingly regarded as a messianic figure in Iran.\n\nAs protests grew, so did his profile and importance. Although several thousand kilometers away from Iran in Paris, Khomeini set the course of the revolution, urging Iranians not to compromise and ordering work stoppages against the regime. During the last few months of his exile, Khomeini received a constant stream of reporters, supporters, and notables, eager to hear the spiritual leader of the revolution.\n\nKhomeini was not allowed to return to Iran during the Shah's reign (as he had been in exile). On 16 January 1979, the Shah left the country (ostensibly \"on vacation\"), never to return. Two weeks later, on Thursday, 1 February 1979, Khomeini returned in triumph to Iran, welcomed by a joyous crowd estimated (by the BBC) to be of up to five million people. On his chartered Air France flight back to Tehran, he was accompanied by 120 journalists, including three women. One of the journalists, Peter Jennings, asked: \"Ayatollah, would you be so kind as to tell us how you feel about being back in Iran?\" Khomeini answered via his aide Sadegh Ghotbzadeh: \"Hichi\" (Nothing). This statement—much discussed at the time and since—was considered by some reflective of his mystical beliefs and non-attachment to ego. Others considered it a warning to Iranians who hoped he would be a \"mainstream nationalist leader\" that they were in for disappointment. To others, it was a reflection of an unfeeling leader incapable or unconcerned with understanding the thoughts, beliefs, or the needs of the Iranian populace.\n\nKhomeini adamantly opposed the provisional government of Shapour Bakhtiar, promising \"I shall kick their teeth in. I appoint the government.\" On 11 February (Bahman 22), Khomeini appointed his own competing interim prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, demanding, \"since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed.\" It was \"God's government,\" he warned, disobedience against him or Bazargan was considered a \"revolt against God.\"\n\nAs Khomeini's movement gained momentum, soldiers began to defect to his side and Khomeini declared ill fortune on troops who did not surrender. On 11 February, as revolt spread and armories were taken over, the military declared neutrality and the Bakhtiar regime collapsed. On 30 and 31 March 1979, a referendum to replace the monarchy with an Islamic Republic passed with 98% voting in favour of the replacement, with the question: \"should the monarchy be abolished in favour of an Islamic Government?\"\n\nAlthough revolutionaries were now in charge and Khomeini was their leader, some opposition groups claim that several secular and religious groups were unaware of Khomeini's plan for Islamic government by \"wilayat al-faqih\", which involved rule by a marja' Islamic cleric. They claim that this provisional constitution for the Islamic Republic did not include the post of supreme Islamic clerical ruler. The Islamic government was clearly defined by Khomeini in his book \"\" (Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist) which was published while Khomeini was in exile in 1970, smuggled into Iran, and distributed to Khomeini's supporters. This book included Khomeini's notion of \"wilayat al-faqih\" (Governance of the Jurist) as well as the reasoning and in his view, the necessity of it in running an Islamic state.\n\nKhomeini and his supporters worked to suppress some former allies and rewrote the proposed constitution. Some newspapers were closed, and those protesting the closings were attacked. Opposition groups such as the National Democratic Front and Muslim People's Republican Party were attacked and finally banned. Through popular support, Khomeini supporters gained an overwhelming majority of the seats in the Assembly of Experts which revised the proposed constitution. The newly proposed constitution included an Islamic jurist Supreme Leader of the country, and a Council of Guardians to veto un-Islamic legislation and screen candidates for office, disqualifying those found un-Islamic.\n\nIn November 1979, the new constitution of the Islamic Republic was adopted by national referendum. Khomeini himself became instituted as the Supreme Leader (Guardian Jurist), and officially became known as the \"Leader of the Revolution.\" On 4 February 1980, Abolhassan Banisadr was elected as the first president of Iran. Critics complain that Khomeini had gone back on his word to advise, rather than rule the country.\n\nOn 22 October 1979, the United States admitted the exiled and ailing Shah into the country for cancer treatment. In Iran, there was an immediate outcry, with both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. Revolutionaries were reminded of Operation Ajax, 26 years earlier, when the Shah fled abroad while American CIA and British intelligence organized a coup d'état to overthrow his nationalist opponent Mohammad Mosaddegh.\n\nOn 4 November, a group of Iranian college students calling themselves the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, took control of the American Embassy in Tehran, holding 52 embassy staff hostage for 444 days – an event known as the Iran hostage crisis. In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as a flagrant violation of international law and aroused intense anger and anti-Iranian sentiments.\n\nIn Iran, the takeover was immensely popular and earned the support of Khomeini under the slogan \"America can't do a damn thing against us.\" The seizure of the embassy of a country he called the \"Great Satan\" helped to advance the cause of theocratic government and outflank politicians and groups who emphasized stability and normalized relations with other countries. Khomeini is reported to have told his president: \"This action has many benefits ... this has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections.\" The new constitution was successfully passed by referendum a month after the hostage crisis began.\n\nThe crisis had the effect of splitting of the opposition into two groups – radicals supporting the hostage taking, and the moderates opposing it. On 23 February 1980, Khomeini proclaimed Iran's Majlis would decide the fate of the American embassy hostages, and demanded that the United States hand over the Shah for trial in Iran for crimes against the nation. Although the Shah died a few months later, during the summer, the crisis continued. In Iran, supporters of Khomeini named the embassy a \"Den of Espionage\", publicizing details regarding armaments, espionage equipment and many volumes of official and classified documents which they found there.\n\nKhomeini believed in Muslim unity and solidarity and the export of his revolution throughout the world. He believed Shia and (the significantly more numerous) Sunni Muslims should be \"united and stand firmly against Western and arrogant powers.\"\n\"Establishing the Islamic state world-wide belong to the great goals of the revolution.\" He declared the birth week of Muhammad (the week between 12th to 17th of Rabi' al-awwal) as the \"Unity week\". Then he declared the last Friday of Ramadan as International Day of Quds in 1981.\n\nShortly after assuming power, Khomeini began calling for Islamic revolutions across the Muslim world, including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq, the one large state besides Iran with a Shia majority population. At the same time Saddam Hussein, Iraq's secular Arab nationalist Ba'athist leader, was eager to take advantage of Iran's weakened military and (what he assumed was) revolutionary chaos, and in particular to occupy Iran's adjacent oil-rich province of Khuzestan, and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country.\n\nIn September 1980, Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran, starting what would become the eight-year-long Iran–Iraq War (September 1980 – August 1988). A combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and, despite Saddam's internationally condemned use of poison gas, Iran had by early 1982 regained almost all of the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowing him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, instead demanding reparations and the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power. In 1982, there was an attempted military coup against Khomeini. The Iran–Iraq war ended in 1988, with 320,000–720,000 Iranian soldiers and militia killed.\n\nAlthough Iran's population and economy were three times the size of Iraq's, the latter was aided by neighboring Persian Gulf Arab states, as well as the Soviet Bloc and Western countries. The Persian Gulf Arabs and the West wanted to be sure the Islamic revolution did not spread across the Persian Gulf, while the Soviet Union was concerned about the potential threat posed to its rule in central Asia to the north. However, Iran had large amounts of ammunition provided by the United States of America during the Shah's era and the United States illegally smuggled arms to Iran during the 1980s despite Khomeini's anti-Western policy (see Iran–Contra affair).\n\nDuring war Iranians used human wave attacks (people walking to certain death including child soldiers) on Iraq, with his promise that they would automatically go to paradise—alJanna— if they died in battle, and his pursuit of victory in the Iran–Iraq War that ultimately proved futile. By March 1984, Iran's population had dropped by well over two million. This included an estimated one and a half million that had fled Iran, victims of political executions, and the hundreds of thousands of \"martyrs\" from Khomeini's bloody \"human wave \" attacks on Iraq.\n\nThe war continued for over seven years with mounting costs. 1988 saw deadly month-long Iraqi missile attacks on Tehran, mounting economic problems, the demoralization of Iranian troops, attacks by the American Navy on Iranian ships, oil rigs, and a commercial airplane, and the recapture by Iraq of the Faw Peninsula.\nIn July of that year, Khomeini, in his words, \"drank the cup of poison\" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Despite the high cost of the war – 450,000 to 950,000 Iranian casualties and USD $300 billion – Khomeini insisted that extending the war into Iraq in an attempt to overthrow Saddam had not been a mistake. In a \"Letter to Clergy\" he wrote: \"... we do not repent, nor are we sorry for even a single moment for our performance during the war. Have we forgotten that we fought to fulfill our religious duty and that the result is a marginal issue?\"\n\nIn an interview with Gareth Porter, Mohsen Rafighdoost, the eight-year war time minister of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, disclosed how Khomeini had opposed his proposal for beginning working on both nuclear and chemical weapons by a fatwa which had never been made public in details of when and how it was issued.\n\nIn early 1989, Khomeini issued a fatwā calling for the assassination of Salman Rushdie, an India-born British author. Rushdie's book, \"The Satanic Verses\", published in 1988, was alleged to commit blasphemy against Islam and Khomeini's juristic ruling (fatwā) prescribed Rushdie's assassination by any Muslim. The fatwā required not only Rushdie's execution, but also the execution of \"all those involved in the publication\" of the book.\n\nKhomeini's fatwā was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of free speech and freedom of religion. The fatwā has also been attacked for violating the rules of fiqh by not allowing the accused an opportunity to defend himself, and because \"even the most rigorous and extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence.\"\n\nThough Rushdie publicly regretted \"the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam\", the fatwa was not revoked.\n\nRushdie himself was not killed but Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator of the book \"The Satanic Verses\", was murdered and two other translators of the book survived murder attempts.\n\nIn a speech given to a huge crowd after returning to Iran from exile 1 February 1979, Khomeini made a variety of promises to Iranians for his coming Islamic regime: a popularly elected government that would represent the people of Iran and with which the clergy would not interfere. He promised that \"no one should remain homeless in this country,\" and that Iranians would have free telephone, heating, electricity, bus services and free oil at their doorstep.\n\nUnder Khomeini's rule, Sharia (Islamic law) was introduced, with the Islamic dress code enforced for both men and women by Islamic Revolutionary Guards and other Islamic groups Women were required to cover their hair, and men were not allowed to wear shorts. Alcoholic drinks, most Western movies, and the practice of men and women swimming or sunbathing together were banned. The Iranian educational curriculum was Islamized at all levels with the Islamic Cultural Revolution; the \"Committee for Islamization of Universities\" carried this out thoroughly. The broadcasting of any music other than martial or religious on Iranian radio and television was banned by Khomeini in July 1979. The ban lasted 10 years (approximately the rest of his life).\n\nKhomeini is said to have stressed \"the spiritual over the material\". Six months after his first speech he expressed exasperation with complaints about the sharp drop in Iran's standard of living, saying that: \"I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons.\" On another occasion emphasizing the importance of martyrdom over material prosperity, he said: \"Could anyone wish his child to be martyred to obtain a good house? This is not the issue. The issue is another world.\" He is also reportedly famous for answering a question about his economic policies by declaring that 'economics is for donkeys'. This disinterest in economic policy is said to be \"one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the revolution.\" Other factors include the long war with Iraq, the cost of which led to government debt and inflation, eroding personal incomes, and unprecedented unemployment, ideological disagreement over the economy, and \"international pressure and isolation\" such as US sanctions following the hostage crisis.\n\nDue to the Iran–Iraq war, poverty is said to have risen by nearly 45% during the first 6 years of Khomeini's rule. Emigration from Iran also developed, reportedly for the first time in the country's history. Since the revolution and war with Iraq, an estimated \"two to four million entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their capital)\" have emigrated to other countries.\n\nIn a talk at the Fayzieah School in Qom, 30 August 1979, Khomeini warned pro-imperialist opponents: \"Those who are trying to bring corruption and destruction to our country in the name of democracy will be oppressed. They are worse than Bani-Ghorizeh Jews, and they must be hanged. We will oppress them by God's order and God's call to prayer.\"\n\nHowever, in 1983, the CIA helped him by providing a list of Soviet KGB agents and collaborators operating in Iran to Khomeini, who then executed up to 200 suspects and closed down the Communist Tudeh Party of Iran.\n\nThe Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his family left Iran and escaped harm, but hundreds of former members of the overthrown monarchy and military met their end in firing squads, with exiled critics complaining of \"secrecy, vagueness of the charges, the absence of defense lawyers or juries\", or the opportunity of the accused \"to defend themselves.\" In later years these were followed in larger numbers by the erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini's movement—Marxists and socialists, mostly university students—who opposed the theocratic regime. Following the 1981 Hafte Tir bombing, Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone violently opposed to the government, \"enemies of God\" and pursued a mass campaign against members of the Mojahedin, Fadaiyan, and Tudeh parties as well as their families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of counterrevolutionary behavior.\n\nIn the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners, following the People's Mujahedin of Iran unsuccessful operation Forough-e Javidan against the Islamic Republic, Khomeini issued an order to judicial officials to judge every Iranian political prisoner (mostly but not all Mujahedin) and kill those judged to be apostates from Islam (\"mortad\") or \"waging war on God\" (\"moharebeh\"). Almost all of those interrogated were killed, estimates of their number vary from 1,400 to 30,000.\n\nZoroastrians, Jews, and Christians are officially recognized and protected by the government. Shortly after Khomeini's return from exile in 1979, he issued a fatwa ordering that Jews and other minorities (except Bahá'ís) be treated well. In power, Khomeini distinguished between Zionism as a secular political party that employs Jewish symbols and ideals and Judaism as the religion of Moses.\n\nSenior government posts were reserved for Muslims. Schools set up by Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians had to be run by Muslim principals. Conversion to Islam was encouraged by entitling converts to inherit the entire share of their parents (or even uncle's) estate if their siblings (or cousins) remain non-Muslim. Iran's non-Muslim population has decreased. For example, the Jewish population in Iran dropped from 80,000 to 30,000.\n\nFour of the 270 seats in parliament were reserved for each three non-Muslim minority religions, under the Islamic constitution that Khomeini oversaw. Khomeini also called for unity between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Sunni Muslims are the largest religious minority in Iran. 4% belong to the Sunni branch.\n\nOne non-Muslim group treated differently were the 300,000 members of the Bahá'í Faith. Starting in late 1979 the new government systematically targeted the leadership of the Bahá'í community by focusing on the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) and Local Spiritual Assemblies (LSAs); prominent members of NSAs and LSAs were often detained and even executed. \"Some 200 of whom have been executed and the rest forced to convert or subjected to the most horrendous disabilities.\"\n\nLike most conservative Muslims, Khomeini believed Bahá'í to be apostates. He claimed they were a political rather than a religious movement,\ndeclaring:\n\nAfter the Shah left Iran in 1979, a Kurdish delegation traveled to Qom to present the Kurds' demands to Ayatollah Khomeini. Their demands included language rights and the provision for a degree of political autonomy. Khomeini responded that such demands were unacceptable since it involved the division of the Iranian nation. The following months saw numerous clashes between Kurdish militia groups and the Revolutionary Guards. The referendum on the Islamic Republic was massively boycotted in Kurdistan, where it was thought 85 to 90% of voters abstained. Khomeini ordered additional attacks later on in the year, and by September most of Iranian Kurdistan was under direct martial law.\n\nKhomeini's health declined several years prior to his death. After spending eleven days in Jamaran hospital, Ruhollah Khomeini died on 3 June 1989 after suffering five heart attacks in just ten days, at the age of 86 just before midnight. He was succeeded as Supreme Leader by Ali Khamenei. Iranians poured out into the cities and streets in enormous numbers to mourn Khomeini's death in a spontaneous outpouring of grief. In the scorching summer heat, fire trucks sprayed water on the crowds to cool them. At least 10 mourners were trampled to death, more than 400 were badly hurt and several thousand more were treated for injuries sustained in the ensuing pandemonium.\n\nAccording to Iran's official estimates, 10.2 million people lined the route to Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery on 11 June 1989, for the funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Western agencies estimated that 2 million paid their respects as the body lay in state.\n\nFigures about Khomeini's initial funeral attendance which took place on 4 June range around 2.5–3.5 million people. Early the following day, Khomeini's corpse was flown in by helicopter for burial at the Paradise of Zahra cemetery. Iranian officials postponed Khomeini's first funeral after a huge mob stormed the funeral procession, destroying Khomeini's wooden coffin in order to get a last glimpse of his body or touch of his coffin. In some cases, armed soldiers were compelled to fire warning shots in the air to restrain the crowds. At one point, Khomeini's body fell to the ground, as the crowd ripped off pieces of the death shroud, trying to keep them as if they were holy relics. According to journalist James Buchan:\n\nThe second funeral was held under much tighter security five hours later. This time, Khomeini's casket was made of steel, and in accordance with Islamic tradition, the casket was only to carry the body to the burial site. In 1995, his son Ahmad was buried next to him. Khomeini's grave is now housed within a larger mausoleum complex.\n\nGrand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, a former student of Khomeini and a major figure of the Revolution, was chosen by Khomeini to be his successor as Supreme Leader and approved as such by the Assembly of Experts in November 1985. The principle of \"velayat-e faqih\" and the Islamic constitution called for the Supreme Leader to be a \"marja\" (a grand ayatollah), and of the dozen or so grand ayatollahs living in 1981 only Montazeri qualified as a potential Leader (this was either because only he accepted totally Khomeini's concept of rule by Islamic jurists, or, as at least one other source stated, because only Montazeri had the \"political credentials\" Khomeini found suitable for his successor). In 1989 Montazeri began to call for liberalization, freedom for political parties. Following the execution of thousands of political prisoners by the Islamic government, Montazeri told Khomeini 'your prisons are far worse than those of the Shah and his SAVAK.' After a letter of his complaints was leaked to Europe and broadcast on the BBC, a furious Khomeini ousted him from his position as official successor.\n\nTo deal with the disqualification of the only suitable \"marja\", Khomeini called for an 'Assembly for Revising the Constitution' to be convened. An amendment was made to Iran's constitution removing the requirement that the Supreme Leader be a Marja and this allowed Ali Khamenei, the new favoured jurist who had suitable revolutionary credentials but lacked scholarly ones and who was not a Grand Ayatollah, to be designated as successor. Ayatollah Khamenei was elected Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989. Grand Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri continued his criticism of the regime and in 1997 was put under house arrest for questioning what he regarded to be an unaccountable rule exercised by the supreme leader.\n\nAccording to at least one scholar, politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran \"are largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini's legacy\" and that \"staying faithful to his ideology has been the litmus test for all political activity\" there. Throughout his many writings and speeches, Khomeini's views on governance evolved. Originally declaring rule by monarchs or others permissible so long as sharia law was followed Khomeini later adamantly opposed monarchy, arguing that only rule by a leading Islamic jurist (a marja') would ensure Sharia was properly followed (wilayat al-faqih), before finally insisting the ruling jurist need not be a leading one and Sharia rule could be overruled by that jurist if necessary to serve the interests of Islam and the \"divine government\" of the Islamic state.\nKhomeini's concept of (ولایت فقیه, \"velayat-e faqih\") as Islamic government did not win the support of the leading Iranian Shi'i clergy of the time. Towards the 1979 Revolution, many clerics gradually became disillusioned with the rule of the Shah, although none came around to supporting Khomeini's vision of a theocratic Islamic Republic.\n\nThere is much debate to as whether Khomeini's ideas are or are not compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be a democratic republic. According to the state-run \"Aftab News\", both ultraconservative (Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi) and reformist opponents of the regime (Akbar Ganji and Abdolkarim Soroush) believe he did not, while regime officials and supporters like Ali Khamenei, Mohammad Khatami and Mortaza Motahhari believe Khomeini intended the Islamic republic to be democratic and that it is so. Khomeini himself also made statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to democracy.\nOne scholar, Shaul Bakhash, explains this disagreement as coming from Khomeini's belief that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution constituted a 'referendum' in favor of an Islamic republic. Khomeini also wrote that since Muslims must support a government based on Islamic law, Sharia-based government will always have more popular support in Muslim countries than any government based on elected representatives.\n\nKhomeini offered himself as a \"champion of Islamic revival\" and unity, emphasizing issues Muslims agreed upon – the fight against Zionism and imperialism – and downplaying Shia issues that would divide Shia from Sunni.\nKhomeini strongly opposed close relations with either Eastern or Western Bloc nations, believing the Islamic world should be its own bloc, or rather converge into a single unified power. He viewed Western culture as being inherently decadent and a corrupting influence upon the youth. The Islamic Republic banned or discouraged popular Western fashions, music, cinema, and literature. In the Western world it is said \"his glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture\" and \"inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam,\" making the word 'Ayatollah' \"a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance.\" This has particularly been the case in the United States where some Iranians complained that even at universities they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack. There Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the American embassy hostage taking and accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks, and which continues to apply economic sanctions against Iran.\n\nBefore taking power Khomeini expressed support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \"We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence.\" However once in power Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning opponents of theocracy for example: \"I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth.\"\n\nMany of Khomeini's political and religious ideas were considered to be progressive and reformist by leftist intellectuals and activists prior to the Revolution. However, once in power his ideas often clashed with those of modernist or secular Iranian intellectuals. This conflict came to a head during the writing of the Islamic constitution when many newspapers were closed by the government. Khomeini angrily told the intellectuals:\n\nYes, we are reactionaries, and you are enlightened intellectuals: You intellectuals do not want us to go back 1400 years. You, who want freedom, freedom for everything, the freedom of parties, you who want all the freedoms, you intellectuals: freedom that will corrupt our youth, freedom that will pave the way for the oppressor, freedom that will drag our nation to the bottom. \nIn contrast to his alienation from Iranian intellectuals, and \"in an utter departure from all other Islamist movements,\" Khomeini embraced international revolution and Third World solidarity, giving it \"precedence over Muslim fraternity.\" From the time Khomeini's supporters gained control of the media until his death, the Iranian media \"devoted extensive coverage to non-Muslim revolutionary movements (from the Sandinistas to the African National Congress and the Irish Republican Army) and downplayed the role of the Islamic movements considered conservative, such as the Afghan mujahidin.\"\n\nKhomeini's legacy to the economy of the Islamic Republic has been expressions of concern for the \"mustazafin\" (a Quranic term for the oppressed or deprived), but not always results that aided them. During the 1990s the \"mustazafin\" and disabled war veterans rioted on several occasions, protesting the demolition of their shantytowns and rising food prices, etc. Khomeini's disdain for the science of economics (\"economics is for donkeys\") is said to have been \"mirrored\" by the populist redistribution policies of former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who allegedly wears \"his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour\", and has overseen sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment.\n\nIn 1963, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini wrote a book in which he stated that there is no religious restriction on corrective surgery for transgender individuals. At the time Khomeini was an anti-Shah revolutionary and his fatwas did not carry any weight with the Imperial government, which did not have any specific policies regarding transsexual individuals. \nHowever, after 1979, his fatwa \"formed the basis for a national policy\" and perhaps in part because of a penal code that \"allows for the execution of homosexuals\", as of 2005 Iran \"permits and partly finances seven times as many gender reassignment operation as the entire European Union\".\n\nKhomeini was described as \"slim\", but athletic and \"heavily boned\".\n\nHe was known for his punctuality:\n\nKhomeini was also known for his aloofness and austere demeanor. He is said to have had \"variously inspired admiration, awe, and fear from those around him.\" His practice of moving \"through the halls of the madresehs never smiling at anybody or anything; his practice of ignoring his audience while he taught, contributed to his charisma.\"\n\nKhomeini adhered to traditional beliefs of Islamic hygienical jurisprudence holding that things like urine, excrement, blood, wine etc. and also non-Muslims were some of eleven ritualistically \"impure\" things that physical contact with which while wet required ritual washing or Ghusl before prayer or salat. He is reported to have refused to eat or drink in a restaurant unless he knew for sure the waiter was a Muslim.\n\nKhomeini was noted by many for his mystique. Before the revolution he benefited from the widespread circulation of a Hadith attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kazim who is said to have prophesied shortly before his death in 799 that:\n\nKhomeini was the first and only Iranian cleric to be addressed as \"Imam\", a title hitherto reserved in Iran for the twelve infallible leaders of the early Shi'a. He was also associated with the \"Mahdi\" or 12th Imam of Shia belief in a number of ways. One of his titles was \"Na'eb-e Imam\" (Deputy to the Twelfth Imam). His enemies were often attacked as \"taghut\" and \"Mofsed-e-filarz\" (corrupters of the earth), religious terms used for enemies of the Twelfth Imam. Many of the officials of the overthrown Shah's government executed by Revolutionary Courts were convicted of \"fighting against the Twelfth Imam\". When a deputy in the majlis asked Khomeini directly if he was the 'promised Mahdi', Khomeini did not answer, \"astutely\" neither confirming nor denying the title.\n\nAs the revolution gained momentum, even some non-supporters exhibited awe, called him \"magnificently clear-minded, single-minded and unswerving.\" His image was as \"absolute, wise, and indispensable leader of the nation\"\n\nThe Imam, it was generally believed, had shown by his uncanny sweep to power, that he knew how to act in ways which others could not begin to understand. His timing was extraordinary, and his insight into the motivation of others, those around him as well as his enemies, could not be explained as ordinary knowledge. This emergent belief in Khomeini as a divinely guided figure was carefully fostered by the clerics who supported him and spoke up for him in front of the people.\n\nEven many secularists who firmly disapproved of his policies were said to feel the power of his \"messianic\" appeal. Comparing him to a father figure who retains the enduring loyalty even of children he disapproves of, journalist Afshin Molavi writes that defenses of Khomeini are \"heard in the most unlikely settings\":\n\nAnother journalist tells the story of listening to bitter criticism of the regime by an Iranian who tells her of his wish for his son to leave the country and who \"repeatedly\" makes the point \"that life had been better\" under the Shah. When his complaint is interrupted by news that \"the Imam\" — over 85 years old at the time — might be dying, the critic becomes \"ashen faced\" and speechless, pronouncing \"this is terrible for my country.\"\n\nAn example of Khomeini's charisma is the effect a half-hour-long, 1982 speech on the Quran by him had on a Muslim Scholar from South Africa, Sheikh Ahmad Deedat:\nAmong some non-Muslim supporters, Khomeini made a different but also favorable impression. Before Khomeini's coming to power, American academic and activist Richard A. Falk wrote that, \"the depiction of him [Khomeini] as fanatical, reactionary and the bearer of crude prejudices seems certainly and happily false\". Furthermore, Khomeini's \"entourage was uniformly composed of moderate, progressive individuals,\" and that \"having created a new model of popular revolution based, for the most part, on nonviolent tactics, Iran may yet provide us with a desperately-needed model of humane governance for a third-world country.\"\n\nIn 1929, Khomeini married Khadijeh Saqafi, the 16-year-old daughter of a cleric in Tehran. By all accounts their marriage was harmonious and happy. She died in 2009. They had seven children, though only five survived infancy. His daughters all married into either merchant or clerical families, and both his sons entered into religious life. Mostafa, the elder son, died in 1977 while in exile in Najaf, Iraq with his father and was rumored by supporters of his father to have been murdered by SAVAK. Ahmad Khomeini, who died in 1995 at the age of 50, was also rumoured to be a victim of foul play, but at the hands of the regime. Perhaps his \"most prominent daughter\", Zahra Mostafavi, is a professor at the University of Tehran, and still alive.\n\nKhomeini's fifteen grandchildren include:\n\nOn the thirteenth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's death, Hezbollah's Nasrollah presented a lecture on significance the Khomeini to international. He drew parallels between Khomeini's revolution struggles and suffering and those of the Lebanon resistance factions and the Palestinian intifada and resistance. In particular, Khomeini's tactics, and particularly his steadfastness and intelligence, had greater relevance because Khomeini's movement was not a political one severed from its roots or a Jihadi revival movement disconnected from ideology, but a movement that rested on a very solid base. The domestic struggle between Ayatollah Khomeini and the Pahlavi regime was far less important, than that the Shah was an agent and instrument of the United States.\n\nKhomeini was a prolific writer and speaker (200 of his books are online) who authored commentaries on the Qur'an, on Islamic jurisprudence, the roots of Islamic law, and Islamic traditions. He also released books about philosophy, gnosticism, poetry, literature, government and politics.\n\nHis books include:\n\n\n"}

In 2014, he was charged with the murder of three women in California between 1987 and 1989. After this conviction, California authorities said that he might have killed people in nine states from 1982 onwards. He claims to have killed as many as 90 people; investigators claim to have linked him to at least 34 murders.\n\nLittle was born on June 7, 1940, in Reynolds, Georgia, possibly during one of his mother's prison stints. Little has claimed his mother was a \"lady of the night.\" Soon after his birth, his family moved to Ohio. He grew up in Lorain and was brought up mainly by his grandmother. He attended Hawthorne Junior High School, where he had problems with discipline and achievement. In 1956, while still a high school student, Little was arrested for the first time and convicted for breaking and entering into property in Omaha, Nebraska. He was held in an institution for juvenile offenders. In the late 1960s, Little moved to Florida, where he lived with his mother. He worked as an ambulance attendant and then a cemetery worker. Having a strong physique, Little took up boxing during prison time and considered himself a prizefighter at one point. Little did not continue his education after high school, spending most of his free time on the streets, engaging in petty theft and occasionally working part time as a day laborer.\n\nLittle was arrested in 1961 and sentenced to three years in prison for breaking into a furniture store in Lorain. He was released in 1964. He left Ohio and shuttled between different states for the following few years and made a living through robbery and theft.\n\nBy 1975, Little had been arrested 26 times in 11 states for crimes including theft, assault, attempted rape, fraud and attacks on government officials. Little spent much of his time with prostitutes and pimps. In 1982 he was arrested in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and charged with the murder of 22-year-old prostitute Melinda LaPree, who had gone missing in September that year.\n\nA grand jury declined to indict Little for the murder of LaPree. But while under investigation Little was transferred to Florida to be brought to trial for the murder of 26-year-old Patricia Mount, whose body was found in the fall of 1982. Prosecution witnesses identified Little in court as a person who spent time with Mount on the night before her disappearance.\n\nDue to mistrust of witness testimonies, Little was acquitted in January 1984 of Mount's murder. Little then moved to California, where he stayed in the vicinity of San Diego. In October 1984, Little was arrested for attacking and beating two prostitutes and was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison. He was released in February 1987 and soon moved to Los Angeles, where he committed several murders.\n\nLittle was arrested on September 5, 2012, at a homeless shelter in Louisville, Kentucky, after authorities used DNA testing to establish that he was involved in the murder of Carol Elford, killed on July 13, 1987; Audrey Nelson, killed on August 14, 1989; and Guadalupe Abodacha, killed on September 3, 1987. All three women were killed and later found on the streets of Los Angeles. \n\nLittle was extradited to Los Angeles, where he was charged on January 7, 2013. A few months later, the police said that Little was being investigated for involvement in dozens of murders committed in the 1980s, which until then had been undisclosed. In connection with the new circumstances in the state of Mississippi, the case of the murder of LaPree was reopened, in which Little was acquitted in 1984. In total, Little was tested for involvement in 60 murders of women committed in the territory of many US states.\n\nThe trial of Samuel Little for the murders of Elford, Nelson and Abodacha began in September 2014. The prosecution presented the DNA testing results as well as testimony of witnesses who were attacked by the accused at different times throughout his criminal career. On September 25, 2014, Little was found guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. On the day of the verdict, Little continued to insist on his innocence. As of 2016, Little was serving a sentence at the California State Prison, Los Angeles County.\n\nOn November 9, 2018, Little confessed to the 1996 fatal strangulation of Melissa Thomas. On November 13, 2018, Little was charged with the 1994 murder of Denise Christie Brothers in Odessa, Texas, after having confessed the crime to a Texas Ranger in May 2018. The Ector County, Texas District Attorney and Wise County Sheriff's Office also announced on November 13 that Little had confessed to dozens of murders and may have committed more than 90 across 14 states between 1970 and 2005. On November 15, 2018, the Russell County, Alabama District Attorney announced that Little had earlier that month confessed to the 1979 murder of 23-year-old Brenda Alexander whose body was found in Phenix City. On November 16, 2018, Macon, Georgia sheriffs announced that Little had credibly confessed to the 1977 strangling murder of an unidentified woman and the 1982 strangling murder of 18-year-old Fredonia Smith. In the fall of 2018, Little confessed to Louisiana State Police the 1982 murder of 55-year-old Dorothy Richards and the 1996 murder of 40-year-old Daisy McGuire; both of their bodies were found in Houma, Louisiana. On November 19, 2018, Harrison County, Mississippi sheriff Troy Peterson said that Little had confessed to strangling 36-year-old Julia Critchfield in the Gulfport area in 1978 and dumping her body off a cliff. On November 20, 2018, Lee County, Mississippi law enforcement officials announced that Little had admitted to killing 46-year-old Nancy Carol Stevens in Tupelo in 2005 and that the case would be presented to a grand jury in January 2019. On November 21, 2018, Richland County, South Carolina authorities announced that Little had confessed to murdering 19-year-old Evelyn Weston whose body was found near Fort Jackson in 1978. Little also confessed to having killed 20-year-old Rosie Hill in Marion County, Florida, in 1982.\n\nOn November 27, 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that a Violent Criminal Apprehension Program team had confirmed 34 of Little's confessions and was working to match the remainder of Little's confessions to known murders or suspicious deaths. Little began making the confessions in exchange for a transfer out of the Los Angeles County prison in which he was being held. One included his confession to a previous cold case homicide in Prince George's County, Maryland, previously one of only two homicide cases in the county with unidentified victims.\n\nThe FBI released a list of previously unsolved murders and a map of their locations that Little attributed to himself.\n\n"}

Her first US appearance was in \"Excalibur\" #3 (1988).\n\nOpul Lun Sat-Yr-9 is the dictator of Earth-794, along with her lover Kaptain Briton. When he flees to Earth-616 where he has an identical looking counterpart (Earth-616's Captain Britain), she sends armored troops to retrieve him. They mistakenly attack Captain Britain twice, but are repelled on each occasion. Sat-Yr-9 hires the interdimensional mercenary group, the Technet, but Briton swaps places with Britain, and the Technet take the wrong man back to Earth-794. Britain later convinces the Technet of their error. When Sat-Yr-9 tries to stop them departing with Britain, the Technet slaughter her soldiers; the already psychotic Sat-Yr-9 becomes completely unhinged. She kills her subjects, leading Roma to send Captain UK on a mission to overthrow and imprison her. While Britain is on Earth-794, Briton is killed by Betsy Braddock when he tries to rape her.\n\nEscaping to Earth-616 through a dimensional gateway that had been opened by Widget, Sat-Yr-9 kills her alternate reality counterpart, a businesswoman named Courtney Ross (and Captain Britain's ex-girlfriend), and takes her place. As Ross, she tries to create a rift between Captain Britain and his current girlfriend Meggan.\n\nSat-Yr-9 knows about Jamie Braddock's reality warping powers before anyone else (including Jamie himself), since she has already encountered Jamie's alternate reality counterpart. Sat-Yr-9 challenges Ross's coworker (and secret admirer) Nigel Frobisher to a high-stakes card game at the London Hellfire Club, and wins. Frobisher agrees to serve her, and she orders him to rescue the Earth-616 Jamie Braddock from Doc Croc, intending to use his powers as a living weapon against her adversaries. Sat-Yr-9 takes Kitty Pryde under her guidance, enrolling Kitty in the St. Searle's School for Young Ladies, and arranges a deal to save St. Searle's from bankruptcy.\n\nSat-Yr-9 uses Jamie's powers to change Frobisher into a duplicate of the female criminal Vixen, while changing the real Vixen into a fox. With Frobisher replacing Vixen, Sat-Yr-9 takes over the Vixen's crime syndicate. Her powerbase built, Sat-Yr-9 attacks Excalibur, revealing her true identity to them. She tries to enslave Captain Britain (with the implication she rapes him while he is under her mind control), against Frobisher's advice. Frobisher, already humiliated by Sat-Yr-9's treatment of him, rebels, but is killed by her. Excalibur defeats Jamie, and Sat-Yr-9 and her troops are forced to flee. Captain Britain swears to avenge Courtney's death, but is unable to track down Sat-Yr-9.\n\nAfter the events of House of M, Sat-Yr-9 returns. Still posing as the Earth-616 Courtney Ross, she has joined the Hellfire Club as its White Queen, with Viper, a former HYDRA assassin, as her self-proclaimed \"White Princess\" and bodyguard. She tries to convince Captain Britain that she is the real Courtney Ross. Captain Britain remains unconvinced, but has not moved against her.\n"}

She was one of four boys and three girls. She used the Irish form of her name, Sorcha. Irish was the family's first language. She was educated in Laggan National School and St Louis School in Monaghan. After school she went to Dublin and took a commercial course. She then worked as a bookkeeper for Taggart's Garage.\n\nAn early member of Cumann na mBan, in 1914 MacMahon was the local secretary of the Central Branch and was secretary nationally in 1916. She also trained the other women in the branch in first aid and nursing as well as related branch duties. She was on the executive committee for Cumann na mBan from 1915 to 1919. She was an organiser for the O'Donovan Rossa funeral, a mass demonstration arranged when the body of the Fenian was returned from America for burial. MacMahon was selected by Kathleen Clarke as one of the women to deliver messages around Ireland for leading up to the Easter Rising. Once the Rising began MacMahon delivered the mobilisation orders to the Cumann section leaders and also delivered guns, both hidden in her bicycle basket. She continued to act as courier throughout the Rising, moving between garrisons, such as the Four Courts, all week. She was estimated to have made more than 50 trips out of the General Post Office.\n\nAfter the Rising she assisted Clarke with the Irish Volunteer Dependants’ Fund, running it when Clarke had to take time off due to a miscarriage, postponing her own marriage to Tom Rogers to do it. She was very involved in the work and finances of the fund Then she began working directly for Michael Collins. On his instructions she resigned from Cumann na mBan when they announced they were Anti-Treaty. MacMahon did not publicly support either side during the civil war. Her public political activities ended on 6 December 1921. However she continued to work for Collins and hold papers for him until his death in 1922. Collins was aware that his activities would put people working for him in danger so he was concerned. MacMahon had married and moved when she did which added to her safety.\n"}

{"id": "55936509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55936509", "title": "Sword of Islam (Mussolini)", "text": "Sword of Islam (Mussolini)\n\nThe Sword of Islam () was a ceremonial melee weapon given in 1937 to Benito Mussolini, who was pronounced as the \"Protector of Islam\" ().\n\nIn 1934, after the creation of Italian Libya, Mussolini adopted a policy for encouraging comparisons with Islam, calling the local population \"Italian Muslims of the fourth shore of Italy\", building or restoring mosques and Koranic schools, preparing service facilities for the pilgrims going to Mecca and even making a High School of Islamic Culture in Tripoli. Behind the apparent humanitarian intent, fascists and some sectors of the Islamic world were recognizing France and the United Kingdom as common enemies and Mussolini wanted to exploit this to his advantage. These common interests were generated from the aversion to the agreements of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, dominated by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, which had neither fully satisfied the requests brought forth by Italy, nor the requests from this part of the Islamic world. \n\nIn order to earn the favor of the Arabs and to seal himself the alliance, Mussolini, although a signatory of the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See, decided to have bestowed on him the title of \"Protector of Islam\". According to the interpretation of Mussolini, with the Italian government taking over the place of the Ottomans in Libya, such a title was up to him concerning law since, in some manner, he was heir of the authority of the caliph. On March 20, 1937, in the outskirts of Tripoli, Mussolini received the Sword of Islam from Iusuf Kerisc, a leading Berber supporter of the Italian occupation against the Libyan resistance, during a lavish ceremony. After entering Tripoli among salutes of cannons and at the head of a rank of 2,600 cavalrymen, Mussolini reaffirmed his closeness to the Muslim population, guaranteeing \"peace, justice, wellness and respect for the laws of the Prophet.\"\n\nIn spite of the approval from the media of the regime, the ceremony provoked hilarity among the Italian people because of its absurd and paradoxical connotations. One of the photographs of the event, depicting Mussolini on the saddle of a horse held by the halter by a groom, in his official version was retouched and published deleting the groom, in order to make it appear that Mussolini was able to ride his own mount without anyone's help. The detail is often cited as one of the more typical examples of the \"art of falsification\" established in the totalitarian regime.\n\nThe following year, a horse monument was inaugurated in the main square of the Libyan capital in honor of Mussolini. Its base read: \"To Benito Mussolini, peacemaker of the people, redeemer of the land of Libya, the mindful population and exhibitions where the Sword of Islam flashed consecrate in the sign of the Lictor a loyalty that challenges the destiny.\"\n\nThe sword, decorated in arabesque, equipped with a double-edged straight blade and with a hilt and solid gold friezes, had been achieved from the art firm \"Picchiani e Barlacchi di Firenze\" on the order of Mussolini himself. After 1937, it was no longer used and was guarded in a small glass reliquary at Rocca delle Caminate, summer residence of Mussolini. There were no more signs of the precious object after July 25, 1943, when Rocca delle Caminate was ravaged and plundered by anti-fascists.\n"}
