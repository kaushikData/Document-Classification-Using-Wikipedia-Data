{"id": "1989064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989064", "title": "Al-Maʿarri", "text": "Al-Maʿarri\n\nAbu al-ʿAlaʾ al-Maʿarri (Arabic ', full name '; December 973 – May 1057) was a blind Arab philosopher, poet, and writer. Al-Maʿarri held and expressed an irreligious worldview which was met with controversy, but in spite of it, he is regarded as one of the greatest classical Arabic poets.\n\nBorn in the city of Maʿarra during the Abbasid era, he studied in nearby Aleppo, then in Tripoli and Antioch. Producing popular poems in Baghdad, he nevertheless refused to sell his texts. In 1010, he returned to Syria after his mother began declining in health, and continued writing which gained him local respect.\n\nDescribed as a \"pessimistic freethinker\", Al-Maʿarri was a controversial rationalist of his time, citing reason as the chief source of truth. He was pessimistic about life, describing himself as \"a double prisoner\" of blindness and isolation. He attacked the dogmas of religion, criticized and rejected Islam, and became a Deist. He was equally critical and sarcastic about Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism. He advocated social justice and lived a secluded, ascetic lifestyle. He became a vegan, entreating: \"do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals / Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught /\nfor their young\". Al-Maʿarri held an antinatalist thought, in line with his general pessimism, suggesting that children should not be born to spare them of the pains and suffering of life.\n\nAl-Maʿarri wrote three main works that were popular in his time. Among his works are \"The Tinder Spark\", \"Unnecessary Necessity\", and \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" (\"Resalat Al-Ghufran\") which may be considered a precursor to Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". Al-Maʿarri never married and died at the age of 83 in the city where he was born, Maarrat al-Nuʿman. In 2013, a statue of al-Maʿarri located in his Syrian home town was beheaded by jihadists from the al-Nusra Front.\n\nAbu al-ʿAlaʾ was born in Maʿarra, modern Maarrat al-Nu'man, Syria, near the city of Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, during the Golden Age of Islam. He was a member of the \"Banu Sulayman\", a notable family of Maʿarra, belonging to the larger Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the \"Banu Sulayman\" had also been noted as good poets.\n\nHe lost his eyesight at the age of four due to smallpox. His later pessimism may be explained by his virtual blindness. Later in his life, he regarded himself as \"a double prisoner\" which referred to both this blindness and the general isolation that he felt during his life.\n\nHe started his career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his teachers in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE, when al-Maʿarri was still a child. Al-Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his \"Risālat al-ghufrān\". Al-Qifti reports that when on his way to Tripoli, al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.\n\nIn 1004–05 al-Maʿarri learned that his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well received in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival.\n\nHe remained in Maʿarra for the rest of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict vegetarian diet. His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town. Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others. He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad. Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle, in his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area. Al-Maʿarri never married and died in May 1057 in his home town.\n\nAl-Maʿarri was a sceptic in his beliefs who denounced superstition and dogmatism in religion. This, along with his general negative view on life, has made him described as a pessimistic freethinker. One of the recurring themes of his philosophy was the right of reason against the claims of custom, tradition, and authority. Al-Maʿarri taught that religion was a \"fable invented by the ancients\", worthless except for those who exploit the credulous masses.\n\nAl-Maʿarri criticized many of the dogmas of Islam, such as the Hajj, which he called \"a pagan's journey\". He rejected claims of any divine revelation and his creed was that of a philosopher and ascetic, for whom reason provides a moral guide, and virtue is its own reward.\n\nHis religious scepticism and positively antireligious views extended beyond Islam and included both Judaism and Christianity, as well. Al-Maʿarri remarked that monks in their cloisters or devotees in their mosques were blindly following the beliefs of their locality: if they were born among Magians or Sabians they would have become Magians or Sabians. Encapsulating his view on organized religion, he once stated: \"The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains.\"\n\nAl-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly desires and living secluded from others while producing his works. He opposed all forms of violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, he decided not to sell his texts, which made it difficult for him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.\n\nIn al-Maʿarri's later years, he became a vegan, neither consuming meat nor any other animal products. He wrote:\nAl-Maʿarri's fundamental pessimism is expressed in his antinatalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him over the loss of a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life:\n\nEven on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.\n\nAl-Maʿarri is controversial even today as he was sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab world. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of al-Maʿarri during the Syrian civil war. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from the fact that he was a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.\n\nStill, al-Maʿarri is sometimes referred to as one of the greatest classical Arab poets. Some have drawn connections between him and the Roman poet Lucretius, calling them progressive for their time.\n\nAn early collection of his poems appeared as \"The Tinder Spark\" (\"Saqṭ al-zand\"; ). The collection of poems included praise of notable people of Aleppo and the Hamdanid ruler Sa'd al-Dawla. It gained great popularity and established his reputation as a poet. A few poems in the collection were about armour.\n\nA second, more original collection appeared under the title \"Unnecessary Necessity\" (\"Luzūm mā lam yalzam\" ), also simply \"Luzūmīyāt\" or \"Necessities\". The title refers to how al-Maʿarri saw the business of living and alludes to the unnecessary complexity of the rhyme scheme used.\n\nHis third famous work is a work of prose known as \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" (\"Resalat Al-Ghufran\" ).\nThe work was written as a direct response to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom al-Maʿarri mocks for his religious views. In this work, the poet visits paradise and meets the Arab poets of the pagan period, contrary to Muslim doctrine which holds that only those who believe in God can find salvation.\nBecause of the aspect of conversing with the deceased in paradise, the \"Resalat Al-Ghufran\" has been compared to the \"Divine Comedy\" of Dante which came hundreds of years after. The work has also been noted to be similar to Ibn Shuhayd's \"Risala al-tawabi' wa al-zawabi\", though there is no evidence that al-Maʿarri was inspired by Ibn Shahayd nor is there any evidence that Dante was inspired by al-Maʿarri. Algeria reportedly banned \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" from the International Book Fair held in Algiers in 2007.\n\n\"Paragraphs and Periods\" (\"Al-Fuṣūl wa al-ghāyāt\") is a collection of homilies. The work has also been called a parody of the Quran.\n\n\n\n"}

A member of the Republican Party, he is the son of 44th Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle. He is a member of the Tea Party movement, which had many of its members swept into office during the 2010 elections.\n\nPrior to serving in Congress he worked as an associate lawyer and eventually founded his own security company as well as writing for the Scottsdale gossip blog, \"The Dirty\". In the 2010 Republican primary he defeated 10 other candidates and went on to win a majority in the general election. In his first bid for re-election, due to redistricting, he faced a Republican challenge from fellow Representative David Schweikert, ultimately losing the seat in the primary. He currently works for the lobbying firm Clark Hill.\n\nQuayle was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana on November 5, 1976, three days after his father was first elected to the United States House of Representatives. As a child, Quayle frequently visited the White House with his family during the Reagan administration.\n\nQuayle moved to the Phoenix, Arizona area with his family in 1996. Quayle graduated from Duke University in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and earned his Juris Doctor from Vanderbilt University Law School in 2002. Quayle has been admitted to the Arizona, New York, and California bar.\n\nQuayle worked as an associate lawyer at Schulte Roth & Zabel from 2004 to 2005, and Snell & Wilmer from 2006 to 2007. In 2007, Quayle founded Tynwald Capital, a firm specializing in the acquisition and nurturing of small businesses. Quayle was a founding member of APG-Southwest, a full-service provider of security services for businesses, for which he served as the managing partner of its Arizona branch. Quayle currently works for the Washington lobbying firm Clark Hill.\n\nAfter Republican Congressman John Shadegg decided to retire, Quayle launched his campaign following his father's announcement on \"America Live with Megyn Kelly\" that Ben was a candidate for . On August 11, 2010, Quayle released an advertisement in which he called Barack Obama the \"worst President in history\".\n\nQuayle's prior involvement with the controversial rumor and gossip website \"DirtyScottsdale.com\" complicated his run for office. According to the site's founder, Quayle was one of the \"original contributors\" to the site, which covered Scottsdale nightlife with features including sexy photos of women, and was the predecessor to the gossip website TheDirty.com. Quayle initially denied the rumors, before admitting several weeks later that he did, in fact, write material for the site using the pen name Brock Landers.\n\nQuayle won the 10-candidate Republican primary on August 24, 2010 with a plurality of 23% of the vote. In the general election in November, Quayle defeated Democratic candidate Jon Hulburd 52%–41%.\n\nAfter redistricting, Quayle's district was renumbered as the , while his home in Phoenix was drawn into the . However, Quayle's home was just a few yards outside the 6th, leading a source close to Quayle to tell \"National Journal\" that Quayle would run in his original district. While the 6th is as heavily Republican as its predecessor, the 9th was drawn as a fair-fight district.\n\nOn February 6, 2012; Quayle confirmed that he would indeed run in the 6th. Quayle faced fellow freshman Republican Congressman David Schweikert in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. In an unusual twist, Schweikert's home in Fountain Hills had been drawn into the 6th, while as mentioned above Quayle's home had been drawn into the 9th, the geographic successor to Schweikert's 5th.\n\nDuring the bitter primary campaign, Schweikert was widely criticised for a mailer that accused Quayle of \"going both ways\", suggesting that he was bisexual. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator Jon Kyl said that \"such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office\" and Senator John McCain said the mailer was one of the \"worst that I have seen\" and that it \"crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse\". Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer \"utterly false\" and \"a sleazy smear tactic\". Schweikert's spokesman responded that people \"should get their minds out of the gutter\" because the mailer was \"obviously\" referring to \"both ways – as in liberal and conservative\". \"The Arizona Republic\" asked two political scientists to review the mailer, who both said that they had \"never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way\" and said that it was \"difficult to believe\" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional.\n\nAlthough the 6th contained almost two-thirds of Quayle's constituents, Schweikert defeated Quayle in the Republican primary by 53 percent to Quayle's 47 percent. Matt Jette, a business professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management who ran for Governor of Arizona as a Republican in 2010, won the Democratic nomination. Schweikert defeated Jette in the November 6, 2012, general election with 62% of the vote.\n\nAfter being elected to Congress, Quayle announced that he would opt out of the taxpayer funded Congressional health care and pension plan.\n\nIn 2012, Quayle was named \"The Most Conservative Member of the House of Representatives\" by the National Journal. He was awarded the 2011 \"National Taxpayers’ Friend Award\" by the National Taxpayers Union, the \"Spirit of Enterprise Award\" by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and was given a 98% scorecard by the Club for Growth.\n\nControversy arose after a bill to increase combat pay for military personnel was rejected, and Quayle and David Schweikert high-fived, happy about the bill's failure. After the incident, Maria Meacham, the mother of an active-duty soldier upset about the vote, began shouting from the gallery, and was removed by security.\n\nQuayle introduced legislation related to border security, guns, small business, government transparency, and health care and successfully sponsored H.R. 3862, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act \"to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and settlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take regulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other purposes\". According to the Congressional Budget Office, \"Under the bill, complaints against federal agencies, the terms of the consent decrees or settlement agreements, and the award of attorneys’ fees would need to be published in an accessible manner, including electronically.

{"id": "3721566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3721566", "title": "Benjamin Harvey Hill", "text": "Benjamin Harvey Hill\n\nBenjamin Harvey Hill (September 14, 1823 – August 16, 1882) was a politician whose career spanned state and national politics, and the Civil War. He served in the Georgia legislature in both houses. Although he had opposed secession, he stayed with the South and served as a Confederate senator representing Georgia. \n\nAfter the war and near the end of the Reconstruction era, Hill was elected in 1874 to the United States House of Representatives, and in 1877 as a U.S. senator from Georgia. He served in the Senate until his death in 1882.\n\nHill was born September 14, 1823, in Hillsboro, Georgia, in Jasper County. He was of Welsh and Irish American ancestry. He attended the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, where he was a member of the Demosthenian Literary Society. He graduated in 1844 with first honors. He was admitted to the Georgia bar later in 1844. He married Caroline E. Holt in Athens, Georgia in 1845.\n\nAs a politician, Hill was affiliated with a number of parties, reflecting the volatile politics before and after the American Civil War. He was elected to the state legislature of Georgia in 1851 as a member of the Whig Party. He supported Millard Fillmore running on the Know-Nothing ticket in 1856, and was an elector for that party in the Electoral College. In 1857, he ran for governor of Georgia unsuccessfully against the Democratic nominee Joseph E. Brown. In 1859, he was elected to the state senate as a Unionist. In 1860, he was again an elector, this time for John Bell and the Unionist party.\n\nHill was known as \"the peerless orator\" for his skill in delivering speeches, and he was the only non-Democratic member of the Georgia secession convention on January 16, 1861. He spoke publicly against the dissolution of the Union, along with Alexander Stephens, a former opponent. Following Stephens' highly regarded argument, based on a conservative reading of the Constitution, Hill struck a more pragmatic tone. \n\nHis arguments related to the conservative belief that disunion would ultimately lead to the abolition of slavery and the downfall of Southern society. He quoted Henry Ward Beecher, a Northern abolitionist, who enthusiastically supported the dissolution of the Union as a means to end slavery, and described the anti-slavery Republican Party as a \"disunionist\" party, in contrast to the \"Union men and Southern men\" participating in the convention. Acknowledging the need to respond to the threat of Lincoln's election, Hill argued that his fellow Georgians should continue to resist Lincoln democratically within the bounds of the Constitution. He compared this course to George Washington, \"so cool, so brave, and so thoughtful.\" He argued that the Northern states would eventually follow the British course of rising abolitionist thought, followed by acceptance again of slavery due to economic necessity. But he allowed that the South should prepare for secession and war if it should become necessary.\n\nHill voted against secession, but became a political ally of Jefferson Davis, who was elected as president of the Confederacy. When the Confederate government was formed, Hill transferred to the Confederate Provisional Congress. He was subsequently elected by the Georgia legislature to the Confederate States Senate, a term which he held throughout its existence.\n\nAt one point in the Confederate Senate, Hill and fellow senator William Lowndes Yancey had to be separated by other members after a bloody scuffle on the floor.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, Hill was arrested as a Confederate official by the Union and confined in Fort Lafayette from May until July 1865.\n\nUnlike many Confederate politicians, Hill had a long and distinguished career as a \"reconstructed\" Southerner and U.S. politician. He ultimately became a Democrat after the Civil War ended. He spoke out passionately against Radical Reconstruction and in the summer of 1867 made a series of speeches in Atlanta, the most famous being the Davis House speech of July 16, 1867, denouncing the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. His courage and eloquence enhanced his regional fame and won him national recognition.\n\nIn 1874, he was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives, serving from May 5, 1875 - March 3, 1877. He quickly won a reputation as a spokesman for the South. He was later elected by the Georgia legislature to the U.S. Senate on January 26, 1877, as Reconstruction was ending. He served in the U.S. Senate from March 4, 1877, until his death on August 16, 1882. His obituary was featured on the front page of the \"Atlanta Constitution,\" on August 17, 1882.\n\nHill is buried in historic Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Bowersox, she lived in poverty at this time, and had to resort to begging for insulin at a pharmacy to manage her diabetes after her health insurance expired.\n\nIn 2006, the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs chose Bowersox to represent Chicago folk musicians in the Sister Cities program \"Experience Chicago\", held in Birmingham. In 2007, Bowersox traveled internationally on an independent small cafe tour, including Memphis, Oaxaca City, Ankara and Istanbul. She gave birth to a son, Anthony Levi Mason, in 2009; according to Bowersox, his father left her six weeks into her pregnancy.\n\nBowersox auditioned for \"American Idol\" in Chicago, Illinois. She sang \"Piece of My Heart.\" Guest judge Shania Twain commented that she had a \"raw, natural talent.\"\n\nOn March 2, 2010, Bowersox was hospitalized due to Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) from type 1 diabetes, forcing a last minute switch in scheduling to give her extra time to recuperate. Bowersox confirmed the illness on the May 19, 2010 results show during an interview with host Ryan Seacrest. The men competed that day instead of the women. She sang the next day and impressed all of the judges.\n\nThe following week, her strong performance prompted Simon Cowell to state, \"Right now, you are the one everyone has to beat.\"\n\nAfter Siobhan Magnus's elimination from the top 6 of \"American Idol\", Bowersox became the last remaining female contestant in the competition.\n\nBowersox is the first female contestant to make it to the finale since Jordin Sparks won the title in 2007. She is also the first contestant in \"American Idol\" history to have one of their original songs played on the show, or at least during their hometown package. Crystal's original song \"Holy Toledo\" was played on the May 19 Top 3 Results show as the background music for her homecoming package - when she returned to Toledo, Ohio and Elliston, Ohio the previous weekend - and segued into her live performance of the same song at \"Bowerstock\".\n\nDuring her time on \"Idol\", Bowersox dated Tony Kusian, but the couple broke up just hours before the \"Idol\" finale.\n\nOn the final performance day, in Simon Cowell's final critique on \"American Idol\", he called her performance of \"Up to the Mountain\" \"outstanding\" and \"by far, the best performance and song of the night\".\n\nOn May 26, 2010, Bowersox was named runner-up to winner Lee DeWyze. She announced that after her \"Idol\" career, she wants to bring more awareness to type 1 diabetes.\n\nBowersox is the third \"Idol\" Runner-Up (preceded by Clay Aiken and David Archuleta) to never be in the Bottom 3 or Bottom 2.\n\n\nOn May 27, 2010, one day after Bowersox's second place \"Idol\" finish, it was announced that she had signed with 19 Entertainment/Jive Records. Her single \"Up to the Mountain\" has since been released to radio stations and iTunes.\n\nBowersox's debut album, \"Farmer's Daughter\", was released to stores and iTunes on December 14, 2010. Bowersox performed her single \"Farmer's Daughter\" on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on December 16, 2010.\n\nOn October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, all other artists previously signed to these three labels would see their future material released under the RCA Records brand. However, Bowersox was not one of the artists who made the move, and was instead left without a record label.\n\nShe made her acting debut on a second-season episode of \"Body of Proof\".\n\nAn EP of pre-\"Idol\" recordings was called \"Once Upon a Time...\" was self-released in June 2012.\n\nShe was a guest on the Blues Traveler album, \"Suzie Cracks the Whip\", performing vocals with John Popper on the song \"I Don't Wanna Go\", and appeared with them in concert at their concert of July 4, 2012 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado.\n\nIn October 2012, Bowersox signed a recording deal with Shanachie Records.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, it was confirmed that Bowersox's second studio album, \"All That for This,\" would be released March 26, 2013. The album was produced by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos and features Jakob Dylan. Bowersox debuted the first single from the album, \"Dead Weight\", on \"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\" on February 5, 2013. Bowersox told Seacrest, \"This song means more to me than even I can completely comprehend.\"\n\nBowersox began a headlining tour in support of the album on March 1, 2013. The band Montë Mar was her concert opener, as well as her backing band on dates through March 31, 2013. On March 25, 2013, Bowersox appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and performed her song \"Movin' On\" to promote the album. It was announced here that Bowersox will play Patsy Cline in the Broadway production of \"Always, Patsy Cline.\" It was announced on June 11, 2013 that Bowersox would be headlining the Lancaster Festival in Lancaster, Ohio on June 27, 2013\n\nBowersox and musician Brian Walker were married on October 10, 2010, at Uncommon Ground Café in Chicago, the restaurant where the couple had met six years earlier while both performing at Open Mic Night. It was announced on May 6, 2013, that they were ending their marriage.\n\nWhile appearing on \"Good Day L.A.\" to promote her Christmas album on November 26, 2013, Bowersox came out as bisexual. \"I have been bisexual as long as I can remember,\" she said. Bowersox then performed her song \"Coming Out For Christmas\" which explores the subject matter.\n\n"}

Kenyon Ltd in 1941. Established in 1880, J. H. Kenyon Ltd were the undertakers to the Royal Household, and had in that role assisted in arranging the funerals of many members of the Royal Family. After training in all theoretical and practical aspects of embalming, Henley passed his examinations in 1948. Four years later he was appointed the company's chief embalmer. \n\nIn 1961, Henley became an examiner of the British Institute of Embalmers. He also taught embalming techniques, embalming fluid formulas as well as disaster management to funeral directors. In an interview published in 1998, Henley expressed doubts that the mummification of Lenin's body in Moscow was indeed as permanent as claimed by the Russian authorities.\n\nIn his role as chief embalmer for J. H. Kenyon Ltd, Henley carried out the embalming of King George VI at Sandringham House in 1952, that of Queen Mary at Marlborough House in 1953, and that of Sir Winston Churchill at the latter's London home at 28 Hyde Park Gate in 1965. Churchill's body was embalmed in the same room where he had died. \n\nWhen the embalming was completed, the remains were dressed in his silk pyjamas and dressing robe and placed back into his bed. Churchill would lie in repose in private at his Hyde Park Gate home until 9:00 pm Tuesday evening when Kenyon's staff transported his remains to Westminster Hall for public viewing.\n\nFour years later, Henley embalmed the remains of Mutesa II of Buganda; and when Idi Amin had Mutesa II's body returned from London to Uganda in 1971, Henley was requested to accompany it. In 1973, Aristotle Onassis had Henley flown to Athens in his private jet to embalm the body of his son, Alexander. Henley also oversaw the embalming of Judy Garland in 1969, Jimi Hendrix in 1970, Field Marshal Lord Montgomery in 1976, Earl Mountbatten of Burma in 1979, Bon Scott in 1980, and Billy Fury in 1983.\n\nIn the time between 1963 and 1976, Henley also worked extensively in Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Benin and Malawi, and continued to advise royal families worldwide until his retirement from J. H. Kenyon Ltd in 1992, after 51 years of service. In retirement he lived in London and Portsmouth. His funeral was held on 23 November 2005 at St. Wilfrid's Church, Portsmouth, followed by cremation at Portchester Crematorium.\n\nAfter training in disaster management, Henley also served as head of J. H. Kenyon Ltd's emergency services mortuary team. In this role he was involved in the recovery and repatriation of bodies after numerous disasters, including the Kano air disaster in Nigeria in 1973, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster in 1987 and the Lockerbie bombing in 1988.\n\nIt was for this work at major disasters around the world that Henley was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire \"for services in the aftermath of disasters involving the loss of human life\" in the 1997 New Year Honours.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8324621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8324621", "title": "Eugene de Kock", "text": "Eugene de Kock\n\nEugene Alexander de Kock (born 29 January 1949) is a former South African Police (SAP) colonel, torturer, and assassin, active under the apartheid government. Nicknamed \"Prime Evil\" by the press, de Kock was the commanding officer of C10, a counter-insurgency unit of the SAP that kidnapped, tortured, and murdered numerous anti-apartheid activists from the 1980s to the early 1990s. C10's victims included members of the African National Congress.\n\nFollowing South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994, de Kock disclosed the full scope of C10's crimes while testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In 1996, he was tried and convicted on eighty-nine charges and sentenced to 212 years in prison. Since beginning his sentence, de Kock has accused several members of the apartheid government, including former state president F. W. de Klerk, of permitting C10's activities.\n\nEugene Alexander de Kock was born to Lourens Vosloo de Kock, a magistrate and personal friend to former prime minister John Vorster. Vosloo \"Vossie\" de Kock, Eugene's brother, later described him as a \"quiet\" boy who \"wasn't a violent person.\" He also recounted how their father, a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond, indoctrinated the boys in Afrikaner nationalist ideology and taught them \"strict Afrikaans\" as they grew up.\n\nDe Kock developed a long-time ambition of becoming an officer. In 1967, after finishing school, he performed his year-long national service in Pretoria at the Army Gymnasium. During this time, he and the rest of the Gymnasium's six companies were deployed to Rhodesia's border with Botswana to militant ANC incursions. De Kock graduated from the Gymnasium as an infantry soldier in the South African Defence Force. However, he decided not to attend the officers college in Saldanha Bay because of a stutter, and declined to pursue a B. Mil degree. He joined the South African Police's uniform branch in the Eastern Cape. \n\nDe Kock underwent off-duty training at Pretoria's Baviaanspoort Prison with members of the Security Police under Captain de Swart, in what later was to become the SAP's Special Task Force. In 1976, instead of accepting an invitation to train new Special Task Force members, de Kock reported to the Police College for an officers' course and was promoted from warrant officer to lieutenant. In May 1978, de Kock was transferred to South West Africa (now Namibia) and joined the security branch in Oshikati. In 1979, he co-founded Koevoet, an SAP counter insurgency unit tasked with combating the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) during the South African Border War. Koevoet was regarded as a highly effective unit, but its reputation was marred by allegations of brutality towards civilians. Its successes in tracking and killing PLAN guerrillas prompted the SAP to consider setting up a similar division in South Africa.\n\nIn 1983, the SAP transferred de Kock to C10, a counter-insurgency unit headquartered at a farm called Vlakplaas, located 20 kilometres west of Pretoria. De Kock, who had established a reputation for commitment during his tours in Rhodesia and Namibia, was promoted as the unit's commanding officer two years later. Under his leadership, C10—later known as C1—became a death squad which hunted down and killed opponents of the National Party and the apartheid system.\n\nDe Kock first became prominent during his testimony in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), during which he made multiple revelations relating to ANC deaths.\n\nDe Kock has been interviewed a number of times by Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, who ended up releasing a book, \"A Human Being Died That Night\", about her interviews with de Kock, her time on the TRC, and what causes a moral person to become a killer.\n\nUpon being convicted on 30 October 1996, de Kock was sentenced to two life sentences plus 212 years in prison for crimes against humanity. The eighty-nine charges included six counts of murder, as well as conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, illegal possession of firearms, and fraud. De Kock served his sentence in the C Max section of the Pretoria Central Prison.\n\nIn a local radio interview in July 2007, de Kock claimed that former president FW de Klerk's hands were \"soaked in blood\" and that de Klerk had ordered political killings and other crimes during the anti-apartheid conflict. These claims were in response to de Klerk's then-recent statements that he had a \"clear conscience\" regarding his time in office.\n\n\"The Sunday Independent\" reported in January 2010 that de Kock was seeking a presidential pardon from President Jacob Zuma in exchange for more information about the apartheid government's death squads, and that a three-hour meeting between Zuma and the incarcerated de Kock took place in April 2009. A spokesman for Zuma denied the veracity of the report.\n\nIn 2012, de Kock made several pleas for forgiveness to the relatives of his victims. In January, he wrote a letter to the family of Bheki Mlangeni, apologising for killing the ANC attorney in a 1991 bomb attack; Mlangeni's mother, Catherine, doubted de Kock's sincerity as he had never before shown remorse. In February, de Kock met Marcia Khoza in his prison, confessing that he had personally executed her mother, Portia Shabangu, in an ambush in 1989; Khoza would not forgive him, because he had scarcely shown remorse during his TRC hearing.\n\nIn September 2014, de Kock met the Mamas, the family of another of his victims. Candice Mama, daughter of the late Glenack Masilo Mama, did forgive De Kock, even going as far as to express in countless interviews support for his bid for parole.\n\nJustice Minister Michael Masutha announced on 30 January 2015 that de Kock had been granted parole. At the press conference, it was announced that the date of his release would not be made public. Masutha further said that de Kock had expressed remorse for his crimes and had co-operated with authorities to recover the remains of a number of his victims. De Kock was nevertheless to remain on parole for the rest of his life.\n\nIn April 2015, footage from Arlanda Airport dated shortly after Swedish prime minister Olof Palme was shot to death re-emerged. The blurry images appear to show a man similar to Eugene de Kock, which is notable as de Kock himself claimed the South African security services were involved in the assassination. His lawyer has strongly denied that de Kock was in Sweden at that time or that he has ever visited Sweden. (South African spy Craig Williamson was present in Stockholm at the time of the assassination, however, possibly to surveil an ANC conference held in Stockholm.)\n\n"}

Born in Mumbai to screenwriters Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani, he grew up under the influence of the Hindi film industry. He began his career in Bollywood by working as an assistant director in \"Lamhe\" (1991) and \"Himalay Putra\" (1997).\n\nAkhtar, after establishing a production company named Excel Entertainment along with Ritesh Sidhwani, made his directorial debut with \"Dil Chahta Hai\" (2001) and received critical acclaim for portraying modern youth. The film also won a National award. Following it, he made \"Lakshya\" (2004) and had his Hollywood debut through the soundtrack of \"Bride and Prejudice\" (2004), for which he wrote the lyrics. He went on to make the commercially successful \"Don\" (2006). He directed a short film titled \"Positive\" (2007), to spread awareness on HIV-AIDS.\n\nAlthough he initially started his acting career with \"The Fakir of Venice\", his official debut was with \"Rock On!!\" (2008), for which he won a second National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi as producer, and indulged in further experimentation before he wrote the dialogues, produced and acted for the critical and commercial success \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\" (2011), which won him two Filmfare Awards, including Best Supporting Actor. In the same year, he directed a sequel to \"Don\" titled \"Don 2\" (2011), which remains his highest-grossing film till date. He achieved further success by portraying Milkha Singh in the 2013 film \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\", earning him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2016, Akhtar received praise for starring in the crime thriller \"Wazir\" and the comedy drama \"Dil Dhadakne Do\".\n\nFarhan Akhtar was born to screenwriters Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani in Mumbai. His sister is writer–director Zoya Akhtar. His parents divorced during his early days, and his father married Shabana Azmi in 1984. Akhtar has termed his parents the \"harshest\" critics in his career, and also considered Robert De Niro as an \"inspiration\" in the film industry. Akhtar is of Zoroastrian Irani origin, from his mother's side. Akhtar grew up in an agnostic environment and along with his sister Zoya and father Javed Akhtar, he does not believe in any religion.\n\nHe is the grandson of renowned Urdu poet Jan Nisar Akhtar and great-grandson of poet Muztar Khairabadi. Muztar Khairabadi was grandson of Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi, who was a scholar of Islamic studies and theology, notably edited the first diwan of Mirza Ghalib on his request, and later became an important figure during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in his native Khairabad.\n\n. He is also the cousin of Farah Khan and Sajid Khan. He studied at Maneckji Cooper school in Mumbai, and went on to study for a law degree from the HR College, also in Mumbai.\n\nHe married Adhuna Bhabani in 2000, after being in a relationship with her for 3 years. They first met during the filming of his directorial debut \"Dil Chahta Hai\" in 2001, which also marked Adhuna's debut as a Bollywood hairstylist. The couple have two daughters named Shakya and Akira. On 21 January 2016, the couple officially announced their separation after 16 years of marriage. He is rumoured to be dating VJ and actress Shibani Dandekar since early 2018.\n\nAkhtar worked as an apprentice in film distribution and direction for Yash Chopra's \"Lamhe\" (1991) when he was 17 years old and later shifted to an advertisement production house named \"Script Shop\" to spend an approximate 3 years there. He also assisted Pankaj Parashar as a director in \"Himalay Putra\" (1997) before launching himself into direction and writing.\n\nAkhtar made his writing and directorial debut with the critically acclaimed film \"Dil Chahta Hai\" (2001), produced by Excel Entertainment Pvt. Ltd., a production company he established along with Ritesh Sidhwani in 1999. It was shot over a period of three months in Sydney, Goa and Mumbai. Due to its acclaim, he called it a \"turning point\" in his career. The film dealt with the lives of westernised urban youth in Mumbai. Akhtar had written the script based on his trips to Goa and New York, as well as a narration of a story outline by a friend of his. It received international critical acclaim and attained an iconic status, with Akhtar receiving credit for starting a \"new wave\" in Indian cinema. Critic Ziya Us Salam praised Akhtar's direction and commented for \"The Hindu\": \"In his maiden venture, Javed Akhtar's son shows enough glimpses of his pedigree to indicate that promise will attain fulfilment sooner than later.\" Various award shows conferred accolades on the film and nominated it for several categories. The year's National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi for 2002 was won by the film. It was also screened at the International Film Festival of India, the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival. In the same year, he and his sister Zoya Akhtar assisted their father in writing the English lyrics of a song in \"Lagaan\", for which the soundtrack was scored by A. R. Rahman.\n\nAkhtar's next project was \"Lakshya\" (2004), a film about an aimless youngster finally setting a goal for himself, starring Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta. It was shot in Ladakh, Dehra Dun and Mumbai, and marked the beginning of the collaborations between Akhtar and Hrithik. He had to research the army before writing the script and directing the venture. The theme of the film, as stated by Akhtar, was about \"finding oneself\". He also believed that if the same characters and situation were set elsewhere, the main core of the story would remain the same as the film was not about war, as it had been reported. Post-release, the film failed to make a mark at the box office and became a commercial failure. Parul Gupta of \"The Times of India\" gave it a negative review and explained that \"It's hard to reconcile to such triviality when it comes from Farhan Akhtar, considered the ultimate symbol of cool in Hindi filmdom.\" On the contrary, Manish Gajjar from \"BBC\" wrote, in his positive review: \"Young Farhan Akhtar, proves yet again that he is one of the finest directors Bollywood has to date. He has paid full attention to the script and the technical aspects, giving rise to a polished product\".\n\nMeanwhile, Akhtar wrote the English lyrics of Gurinder Chadha's Hollywood film \"Bride and Prejudice\" (2004), along with his sister, Zoya Akhtar, after being recommended by his father. The music for the film was composed by Anu Malik and consisted of a mixture of \"Hindi songs\", \"West side story\", \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and \"Grease\".\n\nIn 2006, Akhtar directed, produced and wrote the screenplay of \"Don\" starring Shah Rukh Khan in the title role, a remake of \"1978 film Don\", starring Amitabh Bachchan. It marked his first project holding the status of a remake. The character of Don became iconic and popular. Despite this, he noted that he did not mean to be a \"torchbearer of the remake brigade\" and did not feel comfortable with being credited for the trend of remakes in the film industry. The film released on 20 October 2006 and was declared a \"hit\" at the box office, grossing around 105 crore worldwide. It became widely known for its dialogues. However, critics predominantly condemned Akhtar's direction and screenplay. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama said Akhtar had \"climbed the ladder as far as craftsmanship is concerned [every frame is well decorated and makes a spellbinding impact] but despite a readymade classic at his disposal, the storyteller just doesn't get it right this time.\"\n\nIn 2007, Akhtar produced the film \"Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.\", directed by debutant Reema Kagti and starring Abhay Deol, Minissha Lamba, Shabana Azmi and Boman Irani. The music for the film was composed by Vishal-Shekhar, marking their first collaboration with him. Akhtar was supposed to make his acting debut with the project, but he had to be replaced by Abhay Deol as he was involved with \"Don\". The film was financed and funded by Exim Bank. This was the first time Excel Entertainment collaborated with a different director as all their previous projects had been involving Farhan as a director. The story of the film revolved around six couples who went to Goa on a honeymoon. The film opened up on 23 February and received mixed reviews from critics, and ended up with an \"average\" box office result.\n\nIn the same year, Akhtar directed \"Positive\", a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It was a short film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about the purpose of the project, Akhtar stated that \"Just as a social stigma, many people believe that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very important for them to understand the value of support to the person who has acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about.\" The film had its background score composed by Ram Sampath but had no soundtrack. It was a part of the \"AIDS JaaGo\" (\"AIDS Awake\"), a series of four short films, directed by Mira Nair, Santosh Sivan, Vishal Bhardwaj and himself, in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's Mirabai Films, voluntary organisations Avahan and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nAkhtar's first project in 2011 was the drama thriller \"Game\", directed by Abhinay Deo. The lead cast consisted of Abhishek Bachchan, Kangana Ranaut, Boman Irani and Jimmy Shergill. He wrote the dialogues and produced the venture. The film received highly negative reviews after release, with critics panning almost all the aspects of it. At the box office, it had a poor opening, and later resulted in giving losses for the distributors, due to a heavily negative word-of-mouth. It was described as a \"washout\" by trade analysts.\n\nLater that year, Akhtar wrote, produced and directed \"Don 2\", a sequel to his 2006 \"Don\". It marked his return to direction after a gap of nearly 5 years. His decision of making a sequel was explained by him in an interview: \"I am wary of sequels having to be made. With \"Don 2\" I could finally make an action thriller the way I wanted to. Good story, classic action and simple plot which has one goal and work towards it effectively and dramatically.\" The film was a major success in India and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production abroad with a worldwide gross of 210 crore. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with Khalid Mohammed stating: \"Throughout, you can’t help feeling that Farhan Akhtar could have made three far more valuable films out of the budget squandered on this thriller where cars are smashed as if they were tea cups.\"\n\nNext year, Akhtar produced and wrote the dialogues of the neo-noir thriller \"\". His production work was followed by the comedy films: \"Fukrey\" (2013) and \"Bangistan\" (2015), \"Baar Baar Dekho\" (2016), \"Raees\" and \"Fukrey Returns\" (both in 2017).\n\nIn 2008, Akhtar made his acting and singing debut in a musical film titled \"Rock On!!\", for which he wrote the dialogues and also produced. The film was directed by Abhishek Kapoor. Prachi Desai, Arjun Rampal and Purab Kohli co-starred along with him. As he had been learning guitar ever since the start of his directing career, he had been well-versed with it and used it for the film. The role played by him was that of Aditya, lead singer of the rock band \"Magik\". He sang five songs for the soundtrack album. The film was acclaimed by critics and received positive reviews upon release. Gaurav Malani of \"The Economic Times\" wrote that the film seemed to be \"clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to get into his character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery.\" Manish Gajjar of \"BBC\" wrote of his performance: \"Director-turned-actor, Farhan Aktar surprises all with his superb, flawless performance, transforming from a hippy-style lead-singer to a subdued, dismal workaholic banker.\" Akhtar received several accolades for his debut performance. The film, in addition won the National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However, it did not create an impact at the box office and turned out to be an \"average\" grosser.\n\nAfter refusing an offer to sing a song for A. R. Rahman's album \"Blue\", Akhtar acted in, and produced his sister Zoya's directorial and written debut \"Luck By Chance\", which had Hrithik Roshan and Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead roles. He was cast in the film after being deemed as a \"perfect choice\" for it. The story of the film revolved around a struggling actor who arrives in Mumbai to become a film star. It was released on 30 January 2009. Though failing to do well at the box office and being declared a \"flop\", the film received generally positive reviews from critics. Neil Genzlinger from \"The New York Times\" said: \"It is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc.\" Rajeev Masand noted: \"Farhan Akhtar delivers a simple-enough likeable performance that is just what the film required — no showy flourishes, no loud outbursts, just a straight off spontaneous act that works like a dream.\"\n\nFollowing \"Luck By Chance\", Akhtar acted in a project titled \"The Fakir of Venice\", which was initially scheduled to release before \"Rock on!!\" and was supposed to be his acting debut. Due to several delays, it was released in mid-2009. It was written and directed by Anand Surapur, and accepted by Akhtar after he described its script as \"very powerful\", while emphasising that it \"touches upon weaknesses and confusions in all human beings.\" Before release, it premiered at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, and the Venice Film Festival at the ArcLight Hollywood. Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the film and felt that \"Akhtar, a producer, director and writer making his film debut here as an actor, is talented and handsome enough – and with looks that could translate into any number of ethnicities – to have a huge career ahead of him.\"\n\nAkhtar acted in, and produced his next film \"Karthik Calling Karthik\" (2010), a psychological thriller directed by Vijay Lalwani. He played Karthik, an introvert character, starring alongside Deepika Padukone for the first time. Preparation for the role involved working on the Rubik's Cube, which he learnt from the director. The film received mixed reviews and praise for Akhtar's acting from critics, with Sukanya Verma highlighting that \"He conveys the anxiety, simplicity and frailty of Karthik even when the script isn't doing it for him. Perhaps it's his innate filmmaker instinct.\" The film had a good opening at the box office, as it was targeted towards the youth of the multiplexes. However, it failed to continue on its business and went on to become a \"below average\" grosser.\n\nAkhtar produced and appeared as one of the three leads in his sister, Zoya Akhtar's coming-of-age film \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\" along with Hrithik Roshan and Abhay Deol, Katrina Kaif and Kalki Koechlin, starring opposite Ariadna Cabrol. He was also credited as the dialogue writer for the film. He was the first actor to be cast in the film, and described his role as a \"fun character\" and a \"guy who for the longest time takes nothing seriously.\" His real life father, Javed Akhtar wrote poetry for the film, which he performs as a voice-over. His performance was favourably received by critics, with Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff.com highlighting his dialogues as \"gentle, they won't make you ROFL; they are more like tender dig in the ribs.\" Kaveree Bamzai of \"India Today\" called his acting \"sensitive, soulful\", further saying that he was \"perfectly capable of reading out his father's poetry.\" The film made 153 crore worldwide and was declared a commercial success at the box office. It also became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films overseas, earning around US$7.25 million. It won two National Awards, the Best Choreography and the Best Audiography.\n\nFollowing \"Don 2\", Akhtar was signed up for the biopic \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\", directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. He plays the role of Milkha Singh. For his role, he had to undergo a training phase at the gym and study the character of Milkha Singh by researching his body language. He also had to prepare his looks to depict a 17-year-old army recruit and endure an on-the-spot preparation at an army cantonment. In 2014, Akhtar acted for the romantic comedy \"Shaadi Ke Side Effects\" alongside Vidya Balan, a film directed by Saket Chaudhary and produced by Pritish Nandy. It was a sequel to \"Pyaar Ke Side Effects\" (2006).\n\nNext year, Akhtar featured in the supporting role in his sister Zoya Akhtar's \"Dil Dhadakne Do\", an ensemble comedy-drama starring Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma.\n\nIn 2016, Akhtar played the lead role of an Anti Terrorist Squad officer in Bejoy Nambiar's \"Wazir\". It was his first action role as an actor, and for which he went through intense physical training and put on eight kilograms of weight. Raja Sen in his review called him \"pretty good [..] early on in the film, but his performance starts to unravel once the film hits hysterical gear and he is required to do more than frown.\" Akhtar also sang the duet \"Atrangi yaari\" with Amitabh Bachchan for \"Wazir\". The film was a box-office success. Akhtar's final release of the year was the rock musical drama \"Rock On 2\", a sequel to the 2008 critically acclaimed \"Rock On!!\". He reprised his role of Aditya Shroff, the lead singer of his band. The film was Akhtar's attempt to bring northeast India into popular culture.\n\nIn 2017, Akhtar essayed the role of a Dawood Ibrahim-alike mafia don Maqsood in \"Daddy\", co-starring Arjun Rampal and received favorable reviews for his performance. His next release was the ensemble drama \"Lucknow Central\", co-starring Diana Penty, Gippy Grewal and Deepak Dobriyal. The film was about a prison escape drama planned by a group of prisoners who also form a music band and was inspired by a real incident. \"Lucknow Central\" was released on 15 September 2017 and met with mixed reviews and financial failure.\n\nAkhtar appeared as one of the nine judges in the beauty pageant Femina Miss India (2002). He was the judge on the first season of the dance-reality show \"Nach Baliye\" (2005). He hosted a TV show on NDTV Imagine, called \"Oye! It's Friday!\" in the same year. He has endorsed several brands as a part of his career, especially after the release of \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\". These include Hindustan Unilever's water purifier product titled Pureit, Chivas Regal, Britannia Nutri Choice Biscuits, IndusInd Bank, Dulux Paint and Titan Industries.\n\nMen Against Rape and Discrimination or MARD is a social campaign launched by Akhtar. The idea came to the mind of Akhtar when in August 2012, Pallavi Purkayastha, a lawyer by profession, was sexually assaulted and then killed by her home watchman.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "21650967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21650967", "title": "Four harmonious animals", "text": "Four harmonious animals\n\nThe four harmonious animals, four harmonious friends or four harmonious brothers \n( or ) is a figure in Jātaka tales and other Buddhist mythology, and can often be found as subject in Bhutanese and Tibetan art. It is perhaps the most common theme in Bhutanese folk art, featuring on many temple murals, \"stupas\", and as a decorative pattern on many daily utensils. It is the best-known national folktale of Bhutan and is popular in Tibet and Mongolia: it is widely referred to in these cultures.\n\nA popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a hornbill) on top of each other. The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life. The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple Śāriputra. Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the five precepts and teaching them to others. One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the Pali version, called the \"Tittira Jataka\".\n\nCommunal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a pecking-order according to strength, size and power: it is which is most respected, not the elephant. Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, \"the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience\". However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the as a monk ('; ') is measured, rather than . Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: \"A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth. Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others.\"\n\nThe four animals represent the different habitats of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground. The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding of language. The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence. The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.\n\nThe primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the \"Vinayavastu\" (), which forms the first section of the Kangyur, the canon of Tibetan Buddhism. In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the Pali Canon of Theravāda Buddhism, and in the texts of the Mahāsāṃghika, Mūla-Sarvāstivāda and Sarvāstivāda orders, almost the same \"Jātaka\" tale is found in the \"Vinaya\" and \"Jātaka\" collections. The Dharmaguptaka and Mahīśāsaka orders did not consider the story part of the \"Jātaka\", however, and only included it in their \"Vinayas\". Bhikkhu Analayo believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a didactic parable taught by the Buddha.\n\nOld Irish scholar Eleanor Hull has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the \"Jātaka\" do. As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.\n\nA similar story was made famous when the Brothers Grimm included it in their collection of folk tales, as the \"Town Musicians of Bremen\".\n\n"}

The plot follows a teenager trying to save his town with R. L. Stine's help after all monsters, demons and creatures from the \"Goosebumps\" franchise begin to escape from their books, wreaking havoc in the real world.\n\nIt was financed by Sony, LStar Capital, and Village Roadshow Pictures, and also produced by Sony Pictures Animation, Original Film, and Scholastic Entertainment. \"Goosebumps\" was released on October 16, 2015, in the United States by Columbia Pictures in RealD 3D and 4DX. and received generally positive reviews from critics. It grossed $150 million against its $84 million budget. A sequel titled \"\" was released on October 12, 2018.\n\nAfter his father's recent death, Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette) and his mother Gale (Amy Ryan) move from New York City to the peaceful town of Madison, Delaware. While settling in the new neighborhood, Zach befriends his neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) until her overprotective father (Jack Black) warns him to avoid contact with them. The next morning, at Madison High School, where Gale works as vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ (Ryan Lee), a shy and clumsy student. That night, Hannah invites Zach to an abandoned amusement park but when they return home, Hannah's father warns again that Zach stays away or something bad will happen.\n\nThe following night, Zach listens as Hannah and her father argue. Followed by screams and crashings objects, he calls the police. Hannah's father assures officers that the noises comes from his television. Shortly after, Gale leaves to supervise a spring break dance at school, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine (Jillian Bell). Fearing that Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the police station while he enters his home with Champ's help. While investigating, they both find a bookshelf with numerous books from the \"Goosebumps\" franchise, each mysteriously locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach opens \"The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena\", releasing the real Abominable Snowman. With Hannah's help, they chase the monster to a local ice rink where Hannah's father appears and encloses the creature again in the book.\n\nBack home, Hannah's father unwittingly reveals that he is \"Goosebumps\"' author, R. L. Stine. When they arrive, the group meets Slappy the Dummy, the evil ventriloquist dummy from \"Night of the Living Dummy\". As revenge for being locked up for years, Slappy burns his own book and flees with all the other \"Goosebumps\" books in the Haunted Car from the book of the same name, after having released him. Stine and the kids are attacked by living lawn gnomes from \"Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes\", being forced to escape. Meanwhile, Slappy rampages through Madison, releasing several monsters, causing panic and destruction around the town: mutant plants from \"Stay Out of the Basement\" destroy the cell towers; a vampire poodle from \"Please Don't Feed the Vampire!\" attacks Lorraine; and the Body Squeezers from \"Invasion of the Body Squeezers\" freeze the officers at the police station.\n\nZach implores Stine to write a new book that can lock all the monsters back, but it can only be done with a supernatural typewriter displayed at school. Along the way, the group is attacked by Brent Green from \"My Best Friend is Invisible\" and the giant praying mantis from \"A Shocker on Shock Street\", so they hide in a supermarket. Will Blake, the werewolf from \"The Werewolf of Fever Swamp\" chases them to the parking lot where he is run over by Lorraine, who survived the attack. However, she is frozen by the Body Squeezers when she enters the police station to ask for help.\n\nStine and the kids go through a cemetery, where Zach realizes that Hannah shines in the moonlight before being attacked by ghouls from \"Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls\". When they arrive at school, Zach confronts Stine in private; he reveals that his daughter is Hannah Fairchild from \"The Ghost Next Door\", creating her to face his loneliness, although she isn't aware that she isn't real. Stine finds the typewriter and begins writing a book based on the events of the film while Slappy burns all the books, releasing every monster, demon and creature spotted in the \"Goosebumps\" franchise on the school's soccer field. Zach and Champ try to warn the students, but nobody believes them until the monsters begin to break into the building. Bees from \"Why I'm Afraid of Bees\" attack Zach in the library while the rest of the monsters manage to enter the school with the help of the Annihilator 3000 from \"\". Champ saves Taylor from the werewolf and become love interests. Slappy finds Stine and breaks his fingers with the typewriter before he can finish the book.\n\nWhile the students and school staff continue to defend themselves from the monsters' attack, Stine and the kids board a school bus to the abandoned amusement park. Slappy discovers them and releases the Blob from \"The Blob That Ate Everyone\" as the monsters arrive at the park. Stine confronts the creature and is devoured while Zach, Hannah and Champ climb a Ferris wheel to finish the book. However, the monsters collapse the Ferris wheel, causing it to roll towards the forest. Zach refuses to open the book because Hannah will also be locked up, but she reveals that she knew the truth about herself all this time. Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the \"Goosebumps\" monsters inside, saying goodbye to Zach with a kiss before being sucked in.\n\nSome time later, Stine starts working as the new English teacher at the school while starting to date Lorraine. After school, Stine reveals to Zach that he re-wrote Hannah back into reality with a new book. She and Zach kiss and leave school together while Stine burns Hannah's book, making her permanently real. When Stine is about to leave school, he looks at the typewriter writing by itself. To his horror, Brent Green has escaped his imprisonment, beginning to write a new \"Goosebumps\" book entitled \"The Invisible Boy's Revenge\".\n\n\nThe first attempt at a \"Goosebumps\" film, in 1998, was set to be produced by Tim Burton. Chris Meledandri, the president of Fox Family Films at the time, said, \"I think you'll see us tackling a scale of story that would be prohibitive to do on the small screen\". However, the film did not materialize since they could not find a script they liked or determine which book or monster to adapt. In 2008, Columbia Pictures acquired rights to create a \"Goosebumps\" film. Neal Moritz and Deborah Forte, the latter of whom had previously worked on the \"Goosebumps\" television series in the 1990s, were chosen to produce the film. Screenwriting team Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were hired as screenwriters, and wrote the original script for the film. The duo decided against adapting any one book in the series, feeling the individual books in the series were too short. Thinking of ways to create a universe where all the creatures in the books could live together, they elected to do a fake biographical film where R. L. Stine writes a book and the monsters within it become real. In 2010, Carl Ellsworth was chosen to write the screenplay. On January 14, 2012, it was reported that a new draft of the screenplay would be written by Darren Lemke; Lemke co-wrote the screenplays for \"Shrek Forever After\" and Bryan Singer's \"Jack the Giant Slayer\". In November 2012, Stine expressed pessimism about the prospect of the film, saying that he would believe that a film can be based on his \"Goosebumps\" series when he sees it. He mentioned \"Where the Wild Things Are\" being adapted into a film almost 50 years after publication.\n\nIn September 2013, it was reported that Jack Black was in talks to \"play a Stine-like author whose scary characters literally leap off the page, forcing him to hide from his own creepy creations\". Black stated that he tried to make the character \"more of a sort of curmudgeonly dark, brooding beast master\". He also said that he attempted to approach this film the same way he does others, trying to \"make it as funny as possible\". Black met with R. L. Stine to get his consent for the film, but determined that his character could not be too similar to the real one; Black explained that he needed the character to be more sinister. Rob Letterman was chosen as the director, reuniting him with Black, after working together on \"Shark Tale\" and \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nIt was announced in February 2014 that Dylan Minnette had been cast as Zach Cooper, and Odeya Rush as Stine-like author's daughter, Hannah. On February 26, 2014, it was announced that the film would be released on March 23, 2016. On April 4, 2014, it was announced that Amy Ryan and Jillian Bell had joined the cast as Cooper's mother and aunt respectively. On April 10, 2014, Ken Marino joined the cast as Coach Carr. On April 28, 2014, Halston Sage joined the cast. On May 1, 2014, the film's release date was moved up to August 7, 2015. Stine stated on May 20, 2014, that he was going to make a cameo appearance in the film.\n\nThe film was promoted at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International where Jack Black and Rob Letterstein interacted with Slappy the Dummy. Slappy even brought some of his \"friends\" out consisting of the Bog Monster from \"How to Kill a Monster\", two Graveyard Ghouls from \"Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls\", Cronby the Troll and a Mulgani from \"Deep in the Jungle of Doom\", the Lord High Executioner from \"A Night in Terror Tower\", Murder the Clown from \"A Nightmare on Clown Street\", the Mummy of Prince Khor-Ru from \"Return of the Mummy\", Captain Long Ben One-Leg from \"Creep from the Deep\", Professor Shock from \"The Creepy Creations of Professor Shock\", Count Nightwing from \"Vampire Breath\", a Creep from \"Calling All Creeps!\", a Body Squeezer from \"Invasion of the Body Squeezers: Part 1\" and \"Part 2\", Carly Beth Caldwell's Haunted Mask form from \"The Haunted Mask\", a Scarecrow from \"The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight\", and a Pumpkin Head from \"Attack of the Jack-O'-Lanterns\". When Jack Black tells Slappy that it is him that Slappy wants, Slappy instructs the Lord High Executioner, Murder the Clown, and Professor Shock to take Jack Black outside to his car. As the monsters leave, Slappy tells Rob some of his pitches causing Rob to leave as well.\n\nSome monsters due for an appearance in the film were cut for budgetary reasons, but Letterman stated that the crew tried to choose the monsters most appropriate to the story. Letterman also stated that he tried to combine both humor and horror in the film, commenting that \"[t]he books themselves are legitimately scary, but they're legitimately funny, and we try to capture that\". In November 2014, the release date was moved back to April 15, 2016. In January 2015, the release date was pushed forward to October 16, 2015.\n\nIn mid-April 2014, a crew of six spent three days gathering visual data for the film in downtown Madison, Georgia. The crew used a theodolite to collect points in three-dimensional space to complete a detailed survey of the city. The visual data was used to create a CGI background of the downtown. Neal Moritz and Rob Letterman stated that Madison was their first choice for the film after scouting the city. Principal photography on the film began on April 23, 2014 in Candler Park in Atlanta; they were also set to shoot the film in Conyers and Madison. On May 19, filming was taking place in the streets of Madison, with 480 \"Goosebumps\" crew members working in Madison and Morgan County. Principal photography ended on July 16, 2014. A stretch of Dawsonville Highway in Georgia was intermittently closed to film a car travelling up and down multiple bridges for the film.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film, featuring original music composed by Danny Elfman, was released on CD on October 23, 2015, by Sony Classical Records. The digital version was released by Madison Gate Records the week before.\n\n\n\"Goosebumps\" had its world premiere screening on June 24, 2015, at the CineEurope film distributors' trade fair in Barcelona, Spain, where the film was presented by Black on stage.\n\n\"Goosebumps\" was released on Blu-ray (2D and 3D) and DVD on January 26, 2016, and includes deleted scenes, a blooper reel, interviews with the cast and crew, an alternate opening, an alternate ending, and a featurette about Slappy.\n\n\"Goosebumps\" grossed $80.1 million in North America and $70.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $150.2 million, against a budget of $58 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, pre-release trackings indicated the film would open to between $20–31 million at 3,501 theaters. However, Sony was more conservative, and projected the film to take between $12–15 million. The film opened on October 16, 2015 alongside \"Bridge of Spies\", \"Crimson Peak\", and \"Woodlawn\", however box office pundits noted that it did not face serious competition except for \"The Martian\", which was entering its third week. It made $600,000 from its early Thursday night screenings at 2,567 theaters, and $7.4 million on its opening day. In its opening weekend the film grossed $23.5 million, beating studio projections and finishing first at the box office. It marked the fourth Sony film to reign at the top of the box office during the fall. Previously the studio scored No. 1 spots over the last seven weeks with \"War Room\", \"The Perfect Guy\" and \"Hotel Transylvania 2\". Families represented the largest demographics with 60%, followed by under 25 with 59% and male/female ratio was split evenly at 50/50.\n\nOutside North America, \"Goosebumps\" was released in a total of 66 countries. Mexico has so far represented its largest opening as well as the biggest market in terms of total earnings with $7.1 million followed by Australia ($6.3 million) and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($6 million). It opened at No. 1 in the United Kingdom and Ireland ($3.9 million). In the United Kingdom, preview takings helped \"Goosebumps\" top the box office ahead of the more heavily hyped \"Dad's Army\". In Russia, it opened at No. 2 behind \"In the Heart of the Sea\" with $1.27 million. Furthermore, it opened in France with $1 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Goosebumps\" boasts more than enough of its spooky source material's kid-friendly charm to make up for some slightly scattershot humor and a hurried pace.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nKevin P. Sullivan of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B rating, citing at the end of his review: \"Nothing about \"Goosebumps\" is revolutionary—at a certain point you may realize that it's as if Nickelodeon produced \"Cabin in the Woods\"—but it's a never-boring trip to a world, where stories and imagination are powerful tools, that just might inspire kids to do the scariest thing of all: pick up a book\".\n\nOn September 2, 2015, it was reported that a sequel was in the planning stages, with Sony looking for a screenwriter. On January 17, 2017, a January 26, 2018, release date was set and Rob Letterman confirmed that he is to return as director for the sequel. On February 6, 2017, it was announced that the film's release date has been delayed to September 21, 2018, taking the place of the release date previously held by \"\".

He has authored three books, and competed in mountain bike pedal-cycle races.\n\nHis first job after leaving school was as a heavy vehicle mechanic, which he retained since, being unwilling to give it up for full-time racing and media.\n\nMartin was born on 4 November 1981 in a suburb of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England. He was named Guy in tribute to Guy Gibson of No. 617 Squadron RAF. His father Ian was a successful privateer motorbike racer who had competed in several Isle of Man TT events, but he was forced to supplement his income with a job as a lorry mechanic, additionally selling bikes. His mother, Rita Kidals, was of Latvian heritage, her father having come to Britain in 1947 as a political refugee. Soon after Martin's birth, the family moved to a house outside the town, where they remained, having four children in total.\n\nMartin had shown an interest in working on trucks as early as age 12. As a child he was fascinated by engines, and would take apart lawnmowers to try to make them go faster. Although his interest matched his father's trade, he was happy for Guy to do his own thing, and indeed would try to stop him \"talking the whole time about engines\" during family holidays to Butlins.\n\nMartin attended Kirmington Church of England Primary School and The Vale Academy school, leaving at age 16. He then enrolled in North Lindsey College on a motor vehicle engineering course, believing at the time that it was appropriate as further education was what everybody did. He quickly realised it was not for him – he was not being paid and was being taught things he either already knew, or thought would never need, and so decided to leave after a month, having secured an apprenticeship as a truck fitter with a Volvo centre, John Hebb Volvo.\n\nMartin and his siblings attended every Isle of Man TT from their births, until their father Ian crashed his Yamaha FZ750 whilst racing at Oliver's Mount, Scarborough in 1988, when Guy was aged 7. After recovering from the resulting broken hip, Martin's father did not race again, but worked as a mechanic in classic bike racing.\n\nWhile completing his apprenticeship as a lorry mechanic, Martin raced motorbikes in his spare time. Martin returned to the Isle of Man at age 16; overhearing lorry driver and amateur racer Baz Kirk discussing his plans to race in the 1997 Manx Grand Prix with his father, he was offered the chance to assist him as a race mechanic.\n\nMartin decided to take up racing after a crash on public roads at age 18. He moved to Ireland to join Team Racing. In 2004 he moved to the Uel Duncan Racing team, staying with them until 2005. In 2006 Martin raced for Alistair Flanagan's AIM Yamaha race team, replacing John McGuinness. In the search for a more competitive team, Martin joined Hydrex Honda for the 2007 season.\n\nThe end of 2009 saw Martin leave Hydrex for Northern Ireland-based Wilson Craig Honda, but since November 2010, Martin has raced for TAS Racing (known as Relentless Suzuki, then Tyco Suzuki from 2012 to 2014, and Tyco BMW from 2015 to present), the team run by the Neill family also based in Northern Ireland, and with a long TT heritage. This switch to what was effectively a factory team meant the end of tuning his own equipment – for TAS he would simply be riding pre-prepared machines.\n\nMartin agreed a new deal for 2015 with TAS after the team agreed a new equipment deal with BMW Motorrad, to ride the BMW S1000RR alongside William Dunlop. Martin was prepared to retire had TAS not chosen to switch to BMW, believing he had raced the Suzuki as hard as he could. With the new bike, he ran his fastest ever lap of the TT circuit in June 2015 – 132.398 mph – just outside the outright lap record.\n\nMartin suffered a serious crash in the Dundrod 150 Superbike event, part of the Ulster Grand Prix races in August 2015. Following the crash, Martin only got back on his racing motorbike in March 2016, for the filming of the F1 special for his \"Speed\" series.\n\nIn other motorbike events, he has purchased a Honda CRF450 with the intention of racing in the Superprestigio Open, and he also intends to compete in the Paris Dakar Rally at some point.\n\nSince 2011, he has also got into bicycle racing, in 24-hour events. For the 2016 season Martin decided not to race in the TT for the first time in 11 years, opting instead for a mountain bike race. He was uncertain if the decision would lead him to retire from road racing, mountain bike racing, or if he would go on to do something else, but said \"if I do race on the roads it will be with TAS\".\n\nMartin signed a new deal with Honda Racing on 18 January 2017 to ride the Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade SP2, rekindling his ambition to win the Isle of Man TT and renewing his focus on his road racing career.\n\nMartin first came to the attention of TV executives in 2009 when he appeared in an ITV4 programme intended primarily for fans of that year's TT race. The then film-producer, Andy Spellman, filmed with Guy at the TT. Spellman shot some additional test material of Martin back at home in the summer and the boss of North One television showed the clips to a BBC executive.\n\nHaving engaged Andy Spellman as his advisor and agent in 2009, Martin worked with North One TV Producers James Woodroffe and Ewan Keil, as he has done to present day. Martin's first appearances on TV documentaries were on programmes based around his passion for engineering rather than his love of adrenaline sport, \"The Boat that Guy Built\" airing on the BBC in 2011, and \"How Britain Worked\" on Channel 4 in 2012. His thrill-seeking side later emerged with the production of the series \"Speed with Guy Martin\", first airing on Channel 4 in 2013. Uncomfortable with presenting to camera or working from a script, his preferred style is to improvise his dialogue, and work by responding to questions from crew off camera, which are designed both to prompt him, as well as keep him focused, and even stop him \"rattling on\" if necessary.\n\nHe later turned down an invitation from Chris Evans to join the new presenting team of the BBC's motoring show, \"Top Gear\". He stated \"With the programmes I do on Channel 4 I'm wagging my own tail, not having it wagged for me.\"\n\nDespite enjoying the work, due to the amount of time it was taking to film his \"Speed\" series, time taken away from his maintenance job, Martin considered taking a break from television in 2015. He changed his mind after reaching a deal to film the India and wall of death programmes, and possibly a few more one-off \"Speed\" specials, including an unstated record in Europe. His August 2015 crash pushed back the planned date for his Wall of Death show, from 4 October.\n\nMartin has written three books about his life, releasing his autobiography, \"Guy Martin: My Autobiography, on\" 8 May 2014. It reached No.1 in the \"Sunday Times\" bestseller list and remained there for at least six weeks, and eventually became the second best selling autobiography of 2014. This was followed by \"Guy Martin: When You Dead, You Dead,\" released on 22 October 2015, and covering the previous year in diary format, from the 24-hour Solo World Mountain Bike Championship to the Isle of Man TT. It was listed No.1 in online retailer Amazon's sales figures for celebrity autobiographies in November 2015, with his main autobiography being No.10. October 2016 saw the release of his latest book, titled \"Guy Martin: Worms to Catch\" featuring Guy's thoughts on the past year and upcoming challenges.\n\nMartin is also listed as the author of companion books for some of his television shows: \"How Britain Worked,\" published on 4 October 2012 and \"Speed\", published on 1 December 2013.\n\nMartin also writes for the driving section of \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper. He has written car reviews on the 2015 Aston Martin Vanquish Carbon, the 2015 Range Rover Sport SVR, the 2015 Ford Transit L2 H2, the 2016 Ford Mustang V8 GT, as well as writing about his own Volvo Vöx and his Wall of Death show.\n\nIn addition to his television and racing activities, Martin has continued to work as a truck fitter. He currently works for Moody International, a Scania centre in Grimsby, working Monday to Fridays, while also regularly working overtime shifts on Saturdays. He only takes short periods off to race or do television work, and on his return ensures he starts early to make up for the time lost. He also earns money by tuning fellow racer's bikes in the evenings. He also takes casual work during TT race weeks. Eager to keep his options open, he has even bought a tractor, using it on biomass farms for seasonal muck-spreading at night.\n\nOn his apprenticeship, he earned £300 a week working a 60-hour week plus 10 hours' overtime on Saturdays, while also attending classroom-based training at college on a day release basis. He also supplemented his income working for his father, who at the time was self-employed, running a truck maintenance business. As well as his truck job, in his early career he also financed his racing with evening shifts at Chicago Rock Café and weekend work at Grimbsy docks. After his apprenticeship, Martin then worked for his father at the local Scania garage.\n\nDue to the filming commitments for \"The Boat that Guy Built\", he ended up losing his job working for his father, but immediately went into town to apply for another truck job.\n\nMartin has set the following speed records.\n\nIn July 2015 it was confirmed that Martin was to pilot Triumph Motorcycles' attempt on the motorcycle land speed record (World's Fastest Motorcycle), at the time standing at 376.363 mph (605 km/h), set by Rocky Robinson in 2010. The attempt was originally scheduled for August during the FIM event at Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States. Competing in the Division C (streamlined motorcycle) category, the Triumph Rocket Streamliner is 25.5 feet long, powered by two turbocharged, methanol fuelled, Triumph Rocket III engines, enclosed in a carbon Kevlar monocoque. A documentary about the attempt was made for Channel 4. His August 2015 crash at the Ulster GP caused the attempt to be postponed until September 2016.\n\nMartin's quest to set a new two-wheeled world land speed record was called off due to conditions on the course. The attempt, on the purpose-built 400 mph motorcycle, suffered a number of setbacks at the track at Bonneville Salt Flats, in Utah, USA.\n\nThe streamliner tipped over when it passed over a rut in the track as it was being towed to the start line. Triumph said rain meant it was not possible to create the required-consistency across the 11-mile course necessary to undertake the attempt. On 18 September 2016, Martin had hoped to complete a required 300 mph trial run before attempting to set a new world record.\n\nA mile into the run the machine lost traction on the damp surface, veering off the steered path and tipping over on the course. Martin was confirmed to be \"completely uninjured\" and the record attempt was postponed once more.\n\nReviewing \"Closer to the Edge\", his breakthrough appearance, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" said: \"What could have been a pretty dull film just for motorbike fans and devotees of the Isle of Man TT race, achieves real human interest and excitement due partly to a focus on one competitor: likable motormouth Guy Martin.\" TV reviewers before and since have noted his gentle but gritty, spontaneous, direct, earthy and blokey style, his infectious enthusiasm, natural talent, nice turn of phrase, and engaging features. It has been suggested he brings something unique to presenting, with comparisons being made with the late Fred Dibnah. In reviewing his subsequent work after he turned down the \"Top Gear\" presenting role, critics have lamented what might have been. According to Jasper Rees of \"The Daily Telegraph\", it is his \"combination of eccentricity and humility that makes him so popular with viewers\".\n\nThe wider media have picked up on his views, interests, reluctance to be famous and \"simple\" lifestyle, leading to descriptions of Martin as a \"working-class hero\". Among racing fans, Martin is seen as something of a cult hero Described as the most famous racer never to have won the TT, he is credited with opening up road racing to a diverse global audience in the modern era. Inside the racing paddock, Martin is seen as somewhat of an outsider or maverick, which he is comfortable with. On joining TAS racing in 2011, team manager Philip Neill praised his enthusiasm and free spirit attitude, commenting \"He's created a Guy Martin brand without even trying and that's also pretty special,\" while also observing his commitment to do things their way.\n\nVarious commentators have also drawn attention to his sideburns, worn since age 16, his use of phrases such as \"graft\" (work) and \"proper\" as well as his addiction to drinking tea – his on screen explaining of the reasons for why he prefers to put the milk in first was part of what drew him to the attention of his eventual television producer Woodroffe.\n\nItems owned by Martin were loaned to the Grampian Transport Museum in Alford, Aberdeenshire to display as part of their 2016 season. He had previously visited the museum in 2011. It featured his Merlin engine, three of his favourite motorcycles, and the gravity racer used in his \"Speed\" series. The bikes were the one he built for the Pike's Peak episode of \"Speed\", his 2003 Suzuki GSXR 1000 K3 (his most used and most prolific race-winning bike) and the 675 Daytona Triumph used in the 2015 TT Supersport races. According to the museum's curator, this was the \"first time anywhere that anybody has presented an exhibition of Guy Martin's engineering items\".\n\nMartin attributes his strong work ethic to his father's example. He does not see his racing or TV presenting as real jobs, only hands-on activities. He has also retained his truck job in part due to the financial security it offered over racing. Describing it as \"like an ingrained, default setting\", he prioritises his mechanic job over other work, even cancelling complicated film shoots at short notice if needed. He takes more satisfaction in a well done truck job than from any motorbike race. He also seeks out casual work as a way to switch off during TT events (practice only being in the evenings). Due to his passion for hard work and engineering, had he lived in Victorian times he sees himself as a railway foreman. He is not fond of spending too much time on the internet, despairing at the distracting effect it has on today's apprentices, who lack interest and commitment. To work through aches and pains he takes cod liver oil, but suspects it is only working as a placebo effect.\n\nMartin is not comfortable with being a public figure and rejects any notion that he is a celebrity, turning down offers such as Top Gear's Star In A Reasonably Priced Car segment. After struggling to come to terms with the fame brought about by his media work, Martin was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Skeptical of the psychiatrist's findings, he says \"It hasn't changed anything, it just confirms why I do certain things in a certain way.\" As a result of his BBC work, he had begun to be recognized by non-racing fans even before the release of the TT3D film. He would be quite happy if nobody watched his shows, as it would mean he would never get recognized. While not wanting to seem unappreciative of the public's support, he tries to cope with fame by avoiding crowded situations. He prefers to live out of his van while racing or on television shoots.\n\nHe does not see TV work as a job in itself and would not miss it if it were to end; he views it as a means to do things he otherwise could not, gaining invaluable sources of information and experiences from the people it allows him to meet. As such, he frequently turns down offers of television work if they don't interest him, and has said his existing TV workload was already becoming an issue. He fears being seen as inauthentic if he became a full-time presenter, seeing some in the industry as \"passionate about anything that they're told to be passionate about\". He has only watched one of his shows, the Pike's Peak episode of Speed, and only on the recommendation of a usually unimpressed friend. While appreciating the things his fame has brought him, he's deliberately avoided getting into an unsustainable financial position by living to excess.\n\nAlthough following in his father's footsteps into motorcycle racing, Martin is clear that it was his own choice, his father never pressured him into it. His passion for the TT was ignited at age 16 with the invitation from Baz Kirk to return to the island. Although he has raced in track events, he is attracted to road racing, and the TT in particular, due to their dangerous nature. He hopes to win a TT before the event is banned for health and safety reasons. He says \"I like a bit of danger. I haven't got a death wish but it makes things exciting, doesn't it?\". He likes the appeal of reaching 200 mph all the time in road races, and their unforgiving nature, something he believes series like the MotoGP or Superbikes simply don't offer.\n\nMindful of the risks, he would not regret dying in a race, but he is prepared to go beyond the line (beyond which you risk crashing), in order to win. The danger feeds his need to feel in control of his destiny, although he conceded the inherent risks mean he would be doing well if he lived to age 60. His major crashes of 2010 and 2015 have not changed his outlook; he has described the moment before losing control in 2010 crash as priceless, the ultimate feeling of danger. He wants to go fast and get near death, while also walking away. He denies he is reckless and believes everything he does is calculated; believing you get out of life what you put in, he ensures he trains and prepares hard for dangerous activities so he is in control of, and can even enjoy, the experience. His television producer agrees, stating \"he's not stubborn, or reckless, he's calculating\". This attraction of the combination of speed and a sense of danger was part of the motivation for him doing his \"Speed\" series.\n\nHe has never wanted to race motorbikes full-time, believing he would get sick of the sight of them, and liking the ability of being able to point to his amateur status to professionals, as both an excuse when he loses and a way to gloat when he wins. He decided to prioritise cycling over the TT in 2016 as he felt he was nearing the point where he would be too old to compete properly, and after 11 seasons at the TT he was beginning to find the routine of the motorcycle season monotonous. While not seeing it as thrilling as motorbikes, he is attracted by the isolation it offers, and the equal combination of both a physical and mental challenge, feeding into a new found desire to break himself simply for the sense of achievement.\n\nMartin owns a Merlin aero engine from a 1942 Lancaster bomber, which he plans to install in his front room, alongside a Scania 144 530 truck engine. He is also hoping to acquire a Daimler 600 engine from a Messerschmitt. He also has a 1915 Amanco \"Chore Boy\" stationary engine with original low tension magneto in his kitchen.\n\nMartin is not particularly interested in watching television or spending time on the internet – he doesn't own a TV and has a pre-smartphone era mobile phone. He is a fan of BBC Radio 4, in particular \"Woman's Hour\" and \"The Afternoon Play\", listening while working on trucks or out in his van. He is also a fan of the rock band The Stone Roses, but has never seen them live.\n\nWhen living at home, his usual evening routine is to make and fix things in his shed until around 11pm. On Sunday mornings he prefers to ride his mountain bike.\n\nDespite having presented a programme on Formula One, Martin's interest in it extends only to the technology – he has no interest in the sport in general, in particular being dissuaded by its politics.\n\nMartin owns a 2013 Ford Transit van and a unique Volvo Vöx supercar. The van is for general transport while the Vöx is just for special occasions, however he does his daily commute to his truck job on his mountain bike. He has owned various Vauxhall Astra vans, until a bad example put him off the type. He now swears by the reliability of the Transit, driving it around 40,000 miles a year.\n\nHe bought the Vöx in 2012 from Koenigsegg engineer Mattias Vöcks \"for the price of a BMW M3\", which he considers was a bargain for what it is – based on a 1967 Volvo Amazon, it was upgraded and customised by Vöcks into an E85 biofuel powered 788 bhp vehicle, which Martin claims has reached 205 mph on a racetrack. The Vöx followed a string of high performance cars Martin bought for special occasions (only ever owning one at a time, and sometimes only owning his van). At age 21 he bought a BMW E46 M3 CSL, followed by a Porsche GT3 RS at age 24, then a new BMW E92 M3 V8, and lastly before the Vöx, a 2010 Aston Martin V12 Vantage bought new at age 28. He found all to be a disappointment or unsuitable in one way or another, being particularly unimpressed with the Vantage, which had been his dream car, but which he found ostentatious, ultimately selling it cheaply, although he had not driven it in 2011 due to the insurance cost, as a result of his speeding points. He now deems supercars by marques such as Aston and Ferrari to be \"fake\" and for people who \"don't know anything about cars\".\n\nHe also owns a large collection of bicycles and motorcycles, including a Bimota which he stored in his kitchen. In bicycles, he has owned a Raleigh Chopper, then a Raleigh Mustang, Falcon Fattrack, but describes his first proper bike as being a Whyte 46 bought in 2005, followed by an Orange 224, Scott Ransom 10, Alpine 160, finally settling on a Cotic, which has become his workhorse, requiring multiple parts replacements due to the wear and tear of constant use.\n\nBy late 2011 he had accrued 21 penalty points on his standard UK driving licence, having been caught speeding several times in his Transit van. He avoided a driving ban when on 18 points, being given another three in lieu of a ban, after the judge showed leniency due to the effect it would have on his livelihood, had he lost it. After a period of \"driving like a saint\" he was expecting to have regained a clean record by April 2015.\n\nFollowing claims made in his 7 April 2015 Sunday Times review of the Aston Martin Vanquish, in which he recounted testing the car on an early morning lap of the TT course, police opened an investigation. Driving almost the full length of the TT course (joining at Quarterbridge garage and finishing at Governor's Bridge), he said he was impressed at how fast it really was, reaching 180 mph down Sulby Straight and becoming airborne at Ballacrye corner, resulting in \"something like a 22-minute lap\". On 27 May police confirmed that after taking advice from the Attorney General's Chambers, they would be taking no further action, while reminding residents and visitors that \"Where there is no upper speed limit, road users must at all times be aware that there is a fine line between what is fast and what is dangerous.\" A few days later in a radio interview, Martin repeated the claims, and stated he had not broken the law as he had only reached high speeds on derestricted roads (i.e., those with no upper speed limit).\n\nA successful debut year on the roads that saw him win the Cock o' the North and International Gold Cup races at Oliver's Mount, Scarborough as well as the Irish 750cc Support Championship.\n\nThe International road race meetings had mixed results: the North West 200 never went particularly well, The Isle of Man TT looked promising but problems soon led to it being another disappointment. At the final international of the year, the Ulster Grand Prix, he took 4 race wins and a 2nd making him the Man of the Meeting.\n\nIn the early season Martin took part in British Superbike and Supersport rounds to prepare for the road racing season. The first major international of the year was the North West 200 in which he finished with an eighth, a fourth, two thirds and a second. In the CP Hire Superstock race after a bad start Martin finished third. The Isle of Man TT was the next major race on the calendar and he got a third, two seconds and a DNF after running out of fuel with fewer than three miles to go until his first pit stop. In the Senior race he just missed out on becoming only the second rider, at the time, to have lapped at more than 130 mph, his best lap falling short at 129.816 mph. Later video footage showed him run wide on the entry to Windy Corner and it was this mistake that led him to miss out on the magical 130 mph lap.\n\nMartin continued to race on the English scene and he regained his Cock o' the North title at the Scarborough circuit before going to Ireland for the Kells Road Races in which he took one race win. This was preparation for the Ulster Grand Prix and in the first race Martin brought home a fifth position, in race two a win, and in the superbike race, which was shortened due to weather, a second. After this red flag the day's racing was cancelled due to bad weather and that meant for the second year in a row Martin was the Man of the Meeting. The Scarborough Gold Cup meeting ended with him winning all the races on the final day including the Gold Cup and the second 600 race of the day after a good battle with John McGuinness and Ian Lougher who were also both on the same Hondas as Martin.\n\nAs well as contesting a full season in the British Superbike Championship, in 2008 Martin again competed in the three International road races but was denied his first TT win when he broke down whilst comfortably leading the opening Superbike race. He was eleven seconds in the lead when an electrical problem forced him out on the fourth lap. He claimed a podium, third, in the Superstock race but suffered further retirements in the Senior and second Supersport races. In September 2008 it was back to Oliver's Mount for the International Gold Cup. Martin won the feature event and now has won 6 Gold Cups in a row, a new record, and also has the lap record for the 1000cc bikes at Scarborough with a time of 1:45.3.\n\nIn 2009 Martin contested all three Internationals as well as selected British Championship and Irish National races. In a move from previous seasons, Martin moved away from the main Hydrex team, preferring instead to run a smaller, close knit team and after a steady North West 200 meeting, confidence was high going into the TT, his number one event of the year, as he sought to win a race at the 37.73 mile circuit on the Isle of Man.\n\n2009 was expected to be the year he broke the seal, but after claiming two seconds and a third on the Superstock, Superbike and Supersport bikes early in the week Martin's engine gave up after coming onto the pit lane in the 2nd 600 race. More grief was to come when putting the bike into gear at the end of his 2nd pit stop during the Senior race his chain snapped, meaning he ended up with another DNF.\n\nMartin regrouped to claim the Southern 100 Championship on the Billown road course in July, after finishing second on no less than three occasions – 2005, 2006 and 2007 – before heading to the third International race of the season, the Ulster Grand Prix. After taking third in the Dundrod 150 Superbike race, Martin repeated the result in the feature UGP Superbike race, held over eight laps, but he ensured he would not be without an International win in 2009 when he won a thrilling second Superbike race, just over a tenth of a second in front of fellow Lincolnshire rider Gary Johnson. He also placed fourth and fifth in the equally close Superstock and Supersport races. At the 2009 Gold Cup at Oliver's Mount, Martin won the Steve Henshaw Gold Cup feature race, becoming the first rider to win seven consecutive meetings.\n\nIn 2010 he failed to take a podium at the North West 200, with his best result being fourth in the second Superbike race. He went to the Isle of Man TT, looking to achieve his first TT victory. However, the meeting was dominated by Ian Hutchinson, who took a record-breaking five victories in all the solo races, and Martin suffered serious injuries in a major crash in the final race.\n\nPrior to that crash, during the Superbike race, Martin received a 30-second penalty for exceeding the posted pit lane speed limit of 60 km/h by just 0.112 km/h. Had he not received the penalty, his overall time would have been 1:46:48.05 and put him in 2nd place, behind Ian Hutchinson who finished with a time of 1:46:31.82.\n\nHis performance at the TT was criticised by Simon Buckmaster, whose Performance Technical Racing built the bikes which Martin was running. He accused Martin of not listening to his race advice, arguing \"He needs to stop being distracted and lift his professionalism. Instead of being a TV star and courting publicity 24x7, he should be concentrating on racing and what's needed to win. Get his focus and concentration into racing, not promoting his name and money-spinning deals.\" He also cited disrespectful behavior during the race and bad language and criticism directed toward a member of PTR in a magazine interview. Martin received considerable public support over both the nature and timing of Buckmaster's comments, coming as Martin was still recovering from the crash, but in a subsequent interview Buckmaster defended what he had said, arguing he was not slating him and stating Martin had no issue with the comments.\n\nIn the final race, the Senior TT, Martin was a challenger to stop Hutchinson achieving the clean sweep, but was involved in an incident on the third lap of the race at Ballagarey, having led the race just before the first pit stop.\n\nRecollecting the crash in 2012, Martin recounted how he has been pushing too hard going into the corner at 160-170 mph, having willingly crossed the line [which if you push beyond you might crash] in order to win. He recalled being thrown from the bike and accepting he was not going to survive the approaching high speed impact with a wall, attributing it to luck that he hit it at the right angle to get away with it.\n\nAirlifted to Noble's Hospital in Douglas with chest injuries, he was later diagnosed as suffering bruising to both lungs and minor fractures to his upper spine.\n\nA superbike race 2 win at the Ulster Grand Prix followed for Martin after his consistent TT. He finished second in the opening superbike race behind Bruce Anstey on the Padgetts racing Honda Fireblade.\n\nMartin made his first 2012 appearance at the Cookstown 100 meeting in preparation for the North West 200 and Isle of Man TT. Martin brought his race season to a close winning five races at Scarborough's Oliver Mount Gold Cup. He also took part in the Ryan Farquhar Parade lap on one of Ryan's own KMR Kawasaki's.\n\nFollowing on from the Cookstown meeting, Martin was set to campaign in all the main races at the North West 200, as a prelude to working up for the Isle of Man TT. However, during the Supersport race he crashed. As a consequence, he was left with a suspected head injury, which resulted in his team manager, Philip Neill, withdrawing Martin from the remainder of the racing programme.\n\nThis led to rumours of a 'bust-up' with the Suzuki Team, and resulted in Martin's team boss, Hector Neill, being interviewed on Manx Radio TT 365 prior to the TT, during which Neill scotched such rumours as; \"Media inspired skulduggery. Paddock tittle-tattle and unfounded hear-say\".\n\nMartin's start to the 2012 TT Festival saw him competing – in a private capacity – at the Pre-TT Classic races at the Billown Circuit, Castletown. Martin was lucky to escape injury while competing in the superbike race, and was battling for the lead of the race on a Suzuki XR69 with Jamie Coward, when he crashed on the final lap. This again led to reports of tension, as the Pre-TT races do not form any part of the main TT racing programme, and posed a potential injury risk to Martin before the TT had begun in earnest. During the practice week for the 2012 Isle of Man TT, Martin made steady progress – albeit amid rumours of differing opinions with his team's management regarding machinery set-up and the team's choice of Pirelli tyres.\n\nMartin made a good start to the Superbike TT, and at the end of the first lap he was lying in third place behind John McGuinness and Cameron Donald. He continued to hold station during the following three laps, but a problem during his final pit stop at the end of lap four, resulted in the team being unable to replace his rear tyre. As a consequence of diminishing grip from a fading tyre, Martin was overtaken on corrected time by Bruce Anstey by the end of lap five, although he did hold on to finish fourth with a time of 1hr.47.20 at an average speed of 126.54 mph. This was followed by fifth place in the Superstock race, a retirement in the first Supersport race and 8th place in the second Supersport outing.\n\nRumours continued to circulate throughout the week about Martin's differences with his team, perhaps instigated by Martin's lateness of signing a contract at the start of the season, although as practice week went on, it was obvious the rumours regarding Martin's split from his team were untrue. The Senior race was scheduled to take place on its traditional Friday – 8 June. However, following adverse weather, the race was postponed until Saturday, 9 June. As a consequence of continued poor weather, the decision to cancel the Senior TT was taken. This was the first time in the race's 105-year history that the Senior had been cancelled due to weather.\n\nSince first competing in 2004, Martin has notched up 11 wins including a hat trick of victories at the 2013 meeting winning the Supersport 1, UGP Superbike and Superbike categories.\n\nMartin joined his teammates in early March, 2015, for pre-season testing. This initially took the form of a four-day test programme at Cartagena and following this the squad deployed to the BMW Motorrad test camp at Almeria in Spain for the next three days.\n\nMartin opened his 2015 season at the Oliver's Mount Circuit on Saturday 11 April, at which he recorded a maiden victory on his BMW S1000RR Superstock at the Scarborough venue. Finishing fourth the following day in treacherous conditions, Martin went on to lift the main prize of the meeting, the Spring Cup.\n\nFollowing their success at Scarborough, the Tyco Team headed to the opening event in the Irish Racing Calendar, the Cookstown 100. Martin continued his fine early season form by winning the opening Royal Hotel Superbike Race, and then sealing a brace of superbike wins at the feature race, the KDM Cookstown 100, again accomplished on Superstock machinery.\n\nMartin was introduced to his factory BMW S1000RR Superbike during a day's testing at Kirkistown on 7 May, in preparation for the team's campaign at the Vauxhall International North West 200 for the opening practice session on 12 May. Martin's arrival at the triangle circuit generated the usual media interest, however the attention continued following some controversial comments concerning the circuit by Martin. On return from a practice lap on his Supersport machine, Martin was briefly interviewed by BBC Sport presenter Stephen Watson. Struggling to qualify, Martin said he was \"bored\" riding the course, citing the number of chicanes which had been introduced in an effort to improve safety. As on previous occasions this resulted in Martin's team boss, Hector Neill, again having to rally to his rider's defence.\nInterviewed by the BBC and other assorted media Neill downplayed the comments, merely alluding to the fact that Martin was becoming concerned that the course was starting to resemble more a purpose-built racing track as opposed to a pure road circuit. This brought reaction from various commentators and competitors, with Philip McCallen questioning Martin's commitment to the sport as well as his indiscreet criticism of the course.\n\nIn a further interview with BBC Sport, again conducted by Watson and with event director Mervyn Whyte in attendance, Martin apologized for his comments and whilst he was supportive of the event, describing it as a \"mega event,\" he continued that he was not too stuck on the circuit, and that he simply didn't like chicanes. Watson drew Martin's attention to the fact that the comments by this time had been seen by over 300,000 people on Facebook. Martin made light of the situation, stating that he was \"caught in the heat of the moment, and simply let rip.\" He then questioned why he was generating such attention for his comments, when the main attention should not have been directed towards him but rather directed towards the racing, and to the fact that Alastair Seeley had qualified on pole position and had subsequently gone on to win the opening race.\n\nThe 2015 Vauxhall International North West 200 was blighted by a series of incidents resulting in races being red flagged. Martin did not make an impression in any of the races, and failed to finish in the top six.\n\nMartin's 2015 Isle of Man TT provided mixed results. Opening his account with a retirement in the Superbike Race, he followed this up by taking a respectable 5th place astride the Smiths Triumph in the opening Supersport TT. Switching back to his BMW S1000RR Superstock machine, Martin came home in 7th place in the Superstock TT. Brought in as a late replacement for the injured William Dunlop in the TT Zero Race, and with negligible practice time, Martin took his electrically powered Victory Racing machine to 4th place in his first participation in the class. He then secured his only podium place of the meeting, again on board the Smiths Triumph Daytona, when he claimed 3rd place in the second Supersport outing. Martin rounded off his 2015 campaign when he took the factory BMW S1000RR Superbike to 4th place in the Senior TT with an average race speed of 129.602 mph, but with a fastest lap average of 132.398 mph, a personal best for Martin and just two seconds slower than race winner and outright lap record holder John McGuinness.\n\nMartin arrived back on the Isle of Man in July in order to compete in the Southern 100 Races which were celebrating their Diamond Jubilee. Poor weather initially hampered the racing programme with the Corlett's Trophies 1000/600cc race red flagged in wet conditions. The race was re-run two days later, with Dan Kneen taking the lead for the opening two laps. However, Martin edged him out, taking the lead on lap 3 and thereafter dicing for the lead with Kneen and Michael Dunlop. Leading at Stadium Corner on the final circuit, Martin looked favourite to take the honours. However, getting maximum drive out of the final corner, Dunlop snatched victory at the line by 0.087 seconds.\n\nMartin then began to take hold of the meeting. Onboard his BMW S1000RR Martin took to the grid for the finale to the event, the Southern 100 Solo Championship.\nPushed hard during the 9 lap race by Dan Kneen, Martin led the pack by the end of the opening lap and continued to hold station at the end of lap 2. Lap 3 saw Martin maintain his lead, however Dunlop low sided at Ballabeg Hairpin putting him out of the race. The ensuing melee enabled Martin and Kneen to break free from the chasing pack and their two-way battle ensued into the following lap. As the race went into the final two laps, the rear echelon of the field started to have an effect on the front running riders, with Kneen being held up in an overtaking manoeuvre at Iron Gate. This enabled Martin to stay clear on the final circuit taking the Southern 100 title for the third year in succession.\n\nFollowing his victory, Guy Martin joined the late Joey Dunlop as the only riders to have won the Southern 100 Solo Championship Race for three years in succession.\n\nMartin crashed at high speed when leading the 2015 Dundrod 150 Superbike race (part of the Ulster GP) in August. On the final lap, being pursued by Bruce Anstey, he left the course at Ireland's Corner, fracturing thoracic vertebrae, his sternum and a number of ribs and his throttle hand, requiring steel rods to be inserted into his back and a pin in his hand. He signed himself out of hospital four days later.\n\nHaving no memory of the incident, being shown footage of the crash for the first time (as depicted on \"Guy Martin's Wall of Death: Live)\" confirmed his suspicion that he had been pushing hard for a perfect corner, due to the pressure from Anstey. He stated that while he had accidents that looked worse, this was the one that caused the most damage. The programme also detailed his recovery period at home, revealing his ice bath treatments in an outdoor pool to relieve the pain, which was affecting his sleep.\n\nIn January 2016 Martin confirmed he would not be racing the 2016 Isle of Man TT as it clashed with a mountain bike race he wanted to compete in, and he would also not be racing the prior North West 200 due to the mountain bike training.\n\nIt was hoped that Martin would be participating at the Southern 100 motorcycle races, defending his solo title and increasing the event's profile. However following his participation in the Tour Divide it was subsequently announced that Martin would not be competing at the Southern 100.\n\nIt was uncertain whether Martin would retire from racing or return for the 2017 season, but it was announced on 18 January that he had signed for the Honda Racing, based in Louth, Lincolnshire, and would compete alongside teammate John McGuinness at various national and international meetings including the North West 200 and Isle of Man TT Races.\n\nIn addition, it was confirmed on 20 March that Martin would compete at the 2017 Tandragee 100 and the Cookstown 100 events.\n\nMartin's first competitive appearance since 2015 was his debut for Honda at the Tandragee 100 on 22 April, riding the new Honda Fireblade Superstock-class machine. During the first lap of the Open Superbike race, Martin was involved in a collision with another rider at Marlacoo corner. Both were unhurt, but retired from the race. Due to an incident involving an Italian rider and poor weather conditions, the rest of the meeting was cancelled.\n\nAfter the Tandragee races, Martin travelled overnight to make the start at Oliver's Mount for the annual Spring Cup races. Although he had been successful previously at the Scarborough circuit, this low key appearance was more about gaining race-time on the new Honda.\n\nMartin's next outing of the season was on the Superstock Fireblade SP2 at the Cookstown 100, additionally riding for the Wilson Craig Team in the Supersport class.\nAfter practice, Martin was qualified fifth fastest in the Supersport, but failed to start in the race. Martin took the big Honda to fifth place in the first Superbike Race, however he again failed to start in the second race.\n\nAs at the Cookstown 100, it was confirmed Martin would ride for both the factory-supported Honda team, and in the Supersport 600 cc class for the Wilson Craig Team. Interviewed by \"BBC Sport\" , Martin was in upbeat mood, saying he hadn't pushed the machine too hard, and was quite happy with a \"steady ride round.\" Martin's criticism of the course in regard to the chicanes was mentioned. When queried on a previous statement made after the 2015 meeting that he would not return to the triangle circuit, Martin commented that the primary reason was to get the necessary race-time to enter the Isle of Man TT Races. He also confirmed that he enjoyed riding at the Northwest 200 and that he had development work to do with the new Honda. When queried why he did not renew his association with the Irish Tyco BMW Team, Martin stated that after the 2015 accident, he had decided to retire from racing but still had respect for Tyco BMW, concluding during the Tour Divide cycle race that he no longer had passion for racing. A reason Martin gave for signing for Honda, was that he could fulfill an ambition, as Honda had promised him he could race a vintage Honda RC181.\n\nPractice produced mixed results for Martin. Following an accident in practice injuring teammate John McGuinness at Primrose Hill on 11 May, a decision was made by Honda Racing to withdraw Martin from that evening's Superstock race. Honda Racing, after further appraisal of the incident involving McGuinness, also withdrew from the remaining events.\n\nOn the Wilson Craig Honda 600 Martin qualified 16th fastest during first practice for the Supersport race, recording a fastest lap of 109.614 mph, slipping to 27th fastest in the second qualifying period, which led to Martin starting the race from the ninth row on the grid, bringing his machine home in 23rd place.\n\nFollowing the North West 200 incident involving John McGuinness riding the new Honda SP2, tests were carried out by the Honda Racing Team prior to the bike arriving at the TT races. The 2017 Isle of Man TT qualifying week was disrupted by poor weather and Martin had little track time. The weather improved towards the end of the week, enabling a full practice session to take place on Friday 2 June. Due to of the lack of practice, the first race day was postponed with the time allotted to additional practice. On 3 June, in ideal conditions, Martin completed four practice laps recording the 26th fastest time, around the road course of in a time of 18 minutes 11.69 seconds at an average speed of .\n\nThe opening race, the Superbike TT, was rescheduled for Sunday 4 June but Martin only got 8 miles into the race before he crashed at Doran's Bend. In an interview afterwards, Martin stated that as he attempted to change down the gearbox after Ballig Bridge in order to negotiate the 4th gear left handed Doran's Bend, he hit a \"false neutral\". Martin was unable to offer an opinion as to whether the bike would be safe to ride in the Senior TT, merely describing the SP2 as a \"Jonah\". Despite crashing at around , Martin only sustained a bruised wrist. \nFollowing his spill in the opening race, Martin also failed to start in both the Supersport race and the Superstock event.\n\nAt the start of the season Martin confirmed his intention to compete at the 2017 Southern 100 races on the Isle of Man. However following the problems with the Honda CBR1000RR SP2 at the TT races, Martin decided not to participate at the event.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, Honda Racing, an English company based in Louth, Lincolnshire also known as \"Honda Racing CBR\", issued a statement to the effect that Guy Martin would not be competing at the 2017 Ulster Grand Prix; the decision was described by an event organiser as \"Naturally I'm disappointed...but it's not altogether surprising given the difficulties the team has experienced throughout the season\".\n\nOn 26 July 2017, it was officially announced that Guy Martin had retired from motorcycle racing. In an exclusive interview with the \"Motorcycle News\" Martin said:\n\nMartin has successfully raced mountain bikes in cross country, downhill races and endurance races. In June 2011, after two years of training, he raced in the Salzkammergut Trophy in Austria. With a time of 14 hours 40 minutes, he was the first British non-professional rider to finish. He achieved his goal of a podium-finish during a 2013 British Championship event in Fort William, Scotland.\n\nHe placed second in the male solo rider category at the Strathpuffer 24-hour mountain bike race (held at Strathpeffer, Scotland) in both 2014 and 2015.\nMartin achieved an ambition and competed in the 2016 Tour Divide mountain bike race, which runs from Banff, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico, negotiating the Rocky Mountains, beginning on June 11. He completed the course, taking 18 days, six hours and 23 minutes, with an average of 150 miles a day.\n\nMartin also competed as part of a Pedal Car Racing team in the 24-hour, 2015 British Pedal Car Championship event at the Shenington Kart circuit on 27/28 June, as part of the Team JMC/Hope Factory Racing Team.\n\nThis six-part series sees Martin renovates a narrow boat, called \"Reckless\", travelling on the canal network using the inventions of the Industrial Revolution. The programme includes reconstructions of early industrial processes such as smelting iron.\n\nThis six-part series examined some of the important engineering advances at the time of the Industrial Revolution. Feeling the country had lost its reputation as the workshop of the world and \"went soft\" under the auspices of health and safety culture, through replicating original working methods in various practical projects, the series was to highlight the ordinary workers who were experiencing long hours while working to remarkable precision, \"within a couple of thousandths of an inch\".\n\nSource for episode titles and broadcast dates:\nIn this episode, Martin helps to overhaul and later drives a steam locomotive on the Severn Valley Railway, Shropshire, in the process working on its boiler, safety valves and a wheel. Using Victorian methods, he also lays some track, forges a coal shovel out of wrought iron, and repairs a 100-year-old train driver's pocket watch.\n\nIn this episode, Martin helps to repair the world's oldest surviving water turbine used to power Gayle Mill, a saw mill in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire. Felling a tree by hand, he transports the lumber to the mill by steam traction engine, to build a replica of the first pedal-powered bicycles. Also covered is the migration of farm workers to city factories, displaced by mechanisation.\n\nIn this episode, Martin helps with winter maintenance on attractions in the Welsh resort of Llandudno, working on the pier, a helter-skelter ride, and the Great Orme Tramway. He also participates in a promenade concert, and covers the Victorian craze of sea bathing.\n\nIn this episode, Martin helps to restore the Newcomen beam engine in the Black Country Living Museum, including making fire bricks using the original methods, restoring the timber frame, renovate the mechanical parts and clean the boiler. Covering Victorian mining methods Martin goes down the museum's mine shaft.\n\nIn this episode, Martin helps to restore the oldest surviving Brixham sailing trawler, using traditional carpentry and rope making techniques (on rope making machines used for HMS Victory), as well as testing a self-made period life jacket. Examining the growth in popularity for fish and chips, he takes a trip on a deep sea trawler.\n\nIn this episode, Martin helps to restore Birmingham Botanical Gardens, learning the Victorian method for glassblowing for the greenhouse panes, rebuilding the very first lawnmower, and for building a rockery. He covers the engineering behind the Victorian fashion for collecting plants from around the world, to be shown off in extravagant botanical gardens.\n\nGuy Martin joins the two-year build sequence of a replica Spitfire I, N3200, coded 'QV', that was buried in a French beach for 46 years (1940–1986), and tells the Boy's Own-style story of its pilot, Squadron Leader Geoffrey Stephenson. Saltwater corrosion ensured very little (if anything) was safely usable on a flying replica.\n\nIn this feature length one off special, Martin follows the final flights of the Cold War era Avro Vulcan Delta winged jet bomber XH558 \"Spirit of Great Britain\". Having been restored to flight in 2007 by a charitable trust, it had been the last flying Vulcan, performing displays every year, until it was decided 2015 would be its last season due to its age and associated insurmountable engineering issues. Its last flight occurred on 28 October 2015. Martin joins the team with four months left, and once certified by the team's chief engineer, is permitted to assist in preparing it for a 1,000 mile farewell tour, as it is jacked up for a vertical alignment test. Examining the design and history, he also meets former Vulcan pilots and the Red Arrows, who display with the aircraft, and aerial footage tracks it on the tours. Since in-flight cockpit access is only granted to Vulcan crew, he also flies alongside it in a formation with other aircraft. He also takes the controls of one of the other surviving Vulcans in taxiable condition, for a fast taxi manoeuvre (ground run to the point of nose lift).\n\n\"\" is a documentary film about the Isle of Man TT races. The film examines what motivates the riders who race the TT and risk everything to become \"King of the Mountain\". Filmed in 3D, the film is a story about freedom of choice and the strength of human spirit. The film follows the leading riders in the 2010 race meeting, in particular Martin and Ian Hutchinson.\n\nIn this series, Martin attempts various challenges based on speed using a variety of vehicles, mostly featuring record attempts. Three series of four hour-long episode were broadcast, along with three special episodes. This was despite Martin's reluctance to film a thord series, saying that he would prefer to \"move on while we are ahead\", continuing with a few one off specials.\n\nSource for episode titles and broadcast dates:\nIn this live special, Martin attempted to set a world speed record on a purpose built version of the wall of death fairground attraction. It also featured recordings of Martin being trained by experienced rider Ken Fox on an existing wall to overcome dizziness, and being given aerial training to overcome the chief limiting factor, the effect of G-force on the human body. The science was explored by Hugh Hunt of Cambridge University, revealing the equation G=S/(25*D), where G is G-Force, S is speed in mph, and D is diameter of the wall, in metres. This revealed the chosen location, a hangar on Manby Airfield, would be too small for Martin's desired target of 100 mph, but with a revised target of 80 mph while remaining below 7G, the 37.5 metre wall that was ultimately built would suffice. This would allow Martin to challenge a previous claimed record of around 70 mph, which the programme believed was wrong, determined through video analysis as having been 45 mph. For the show, Guinness World Records created a new record, Highest speed on a Wall of Death, and set an initial qualifying benchmark of 60 mph in one of two attempts. On a first attempt, using an Indian Scout motorcycle, Martin managed to achieve 70.33 mph, while on a second run, on a bike purposely built by Martin (a 1972 Rob North T160 Trident triple), he extended the record to 125.77 km/h (78.15 mph). Prior to Martin's attempt, on the smaller wall cyclist Shanaze Reade also set the Guinness record for Highest bicycle speed on a Wall of Death, at 42.94 km/h (26.68 mph).\n\nThis one-off half hour programme explored various aspects of Martin's life. It was a repackaging of material previously released as four 7 minute long online only episodes, under Channel 4's Shorts brand, on their online platform 4oD. Episodes \"Prized Possession\" and \"TT Racer\" were released on 18 August 2014, followed by \"Inside the Mind of a Racer\" and \"Proud Mechanic\" on 1 October 2014. Proud Possession focuses on his Merlin engine.\n\nGuy travelled to Latvia to investigate the history of the Latvian side of his family – his deceased maternal grandfather, Walter Kidals, was a Latvian who had come to Britain in 1947 as a refugee from World War II. The family knew little about his story, even his wife had been unaware he was an orphan. Born Waldemars Kidals, the programme found that in 1941 he had been conscripted into the Latvian Legion, part of the Axis Forces when Nazi Germany had occupied Latvia, and later spent two years in a Belgian prisoner-of-war camp. Having been exonerated by the post-war trials, and with Latvia now part of the Soviet Union, all surviving former Latvian conscripts were allowed to settle in the United States and Britain as political refugees – Walter opted for the UK, travelling to Hull.\n\nIn the programme, Martin met surviving members of his family and visited the now cleared site of his family's former farmhouse. Travelling in a 1982 Lada 1300S, he also visited an immersive Cold War Russian prison experience, and watched a reenactment of a battle between the Legion forces and the Soviet Red Army.\n\nGuy Martin is shown embarking on a 1,000-mile motorbike trip, as he explores rarely seen aspects of modern India en route to Rider Mania, described as \"one of the world's maddest bike races\".\n\nGuy Martin's love of industry and endeavour leads him to China, where he reveals the unseen side of its innovation, technological development and gigantic manufacturing.\n\nMartin lives in Kirmington, a village around away from his workplace in Grimsby. At age 24 he was living on his girlfriend's parents' farm. he was preparing to move a short distance, to a smaller house, but with more shed space.\n\nHe has two sisters and a brother. His brother, Stuart, is also a truck mechanic and motorbike racer. His younger sister, Kate, was the first female mechanic in the BSB paddock before leaving to start a family with two-times TT sidecar winner, Patrick Farrance.\n\nAside from a summer living in Ireland, Martin has always lived in North Lincolnshire.\n\nHe lives with his partner, Sharon, whom he met at a moped race in Ireland; she was working for a publisher in Dublin, and moved over to Lincolnshire in 2014.\n\nHe likes the slightly backwards nature of Lincolnshire, comparing it to rural Cuba when he visited. His flying visits to London only make him appreciate home more.\n\nMartin was often joined by friends on his TV shows. In \"The Boat that Guy Built\" he was accompanied by childhood friend Mark \"Mavis\" Davies, who also appeared in two episodes of \"How Britain Worked\", as did his former girlfriend Stephanie when descending the museum's mine shaft with Martin in episode 4. In the Pike's Peak episode of \"Speed\" he is accompanied to the US by his friend Cameron Whitworth, a race mechanic with 17 TT wins, who declined to ride or even sit on the bike due to its power. Having never met before, Martin developed a friendship with David Coulthard while filming the F1 special of \"Speed\", leading to Couthard's later appearance as a guest in \"Guy Martin's Wall of Death: Live.\" Also appearing was Martin's partner, Sharon alongside his family as did friend and mentor, Ken Fox.\n\nHis best friend is Johnny Ellis, who has also been one of his race-mechanics at various times during his career. Although Ellis and Martin had attended the same school, Vale Academy, both being in the same year, they had not been close, Martin observing he was a \"bit flash\" when he once turned up at school on a motorbike. Their friendship developed after Martin joined John Hebb Volvo, where Ellis worked; both being keen to work on trucks during their free time outside school, never knowing their mutual interest.\n\nMartin has a yellow Labrador Retriever called Nigel. Following the inspiration for his own name, Martin has explained Nigel was \"named in reference to his famous dog, although obviously I couldn't call him what [Guy] Gibson called his dog\".\n\nMartin purchased the local 'Marrow Bone and Cleaver' pub in his home village of Kirmington. Dating back to 1871 with origins by a local butcher, it will have ale by Lincolnshire's Batemans Brewery and be run by Martin's elder sister Sally.\n\nHe and partner Sharon have a daughter, named Dottie, who was born on 23 October 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "610957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=610957", "title": "Ijaw people", "text": "Ijaw people\n\nIjaw people (also known by the subgroups \"Ijo\" or \"Izon\") are a collection of peoples indigenous to the Niger Delta in Nigeria, inhabiting regions of the states of Ondo, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, Akwa Ibom and Rivers. Many are found as migrant fishermen in camps as far west as Sierra Leone and as far east as Gabon. Population figures for the Ijo vary greatly, though most range from 13 million to 15 million. They have long lived in locations near many sea trade routes, and they were well connected to other areas by trade as early as the 15th century.\n\nThe Ijaw speak nine closely related Niger–Congo languages, all of which belong to the Ijoid branch of the Niger–Congo tree. The primary division between the Ijo languages is that between Eastern Ijo and Western Ijo, the most important of the former group of languages being Izon, which is spoken by about five million people.\n\nThere are two prominent groupings of the Izon language. The first, termed either Western or Central Izon (Ijaw) consists of Western Ijaw speakers: Tuomo Clan, Ekeremor, Sagbama (Mein), Bassan, Apoi, Arogbo, Boma (Bumo), Kabo (Kabuowei), Ogboin, Tarakiri, and Kolokuma-Opokuma. Nembe, Brass and Akassa (Akaha) dialects represent Southeast Ijo (Izon).. Buseni and Okordia dialects are considered Inland Ijo.\n\nThe other major Ijaw linguistic group is Kalabari. Kalabari is considered an Eastern Ijaw language but the term \"Eastern Ijaw\" is not the normal nomenclature. Kalabari is the name of one of the Ijaw clans that reside on the eastern side of the Niger-Delta (Abonnema, Buguma, Bakana, Degema etc.) who form a major group in Rivers State, Other \"Eastern\" Ijaw clans are the Andoni, Okrika, Ibani (the natives of Bonny, Finima and Opobo) and Nkoroo. They are neighbours to the Kalabari people in present-day Rivers State, Nigeria.\n\nOther related Ijaw subgroups which have distinct languages but very close kinship, cultural and territorial ties with the rest of the Ijaw are the Epie-Atissa, Engenni (also known as Ẹgẹnẹ), and Degema (also called Udekama or Udekaama). The Ogbia clan, as well as residents of Bukuma and Abuloma (Obulom).\n\nIt was discovered in the 1980s that a now extinct Berbice Creole Dutch, spoken in Guyana, is partly based on Ijo lexicon and grammar. Its nearest relative seems to be Eastern Ijo, most likely Kalabari (Kouwenberg 1994).\n\nThe Ijaw ethnic group consists of 50 loosely affiliated clans. These clans are based along kinship lines and/or shared cultural and religious traditions.\n\nThe Ijaw were one of the first of Nigeria's peoples to have contact with Westerners, and were active as go-betweens in the slave trade between visiting Europeans and the peoples of the interior, particularly in the era before the discovery of quinine, when West Africa was still known as the \"White Man's Graveyard\" because of the endemic presence of malaria. Some of the kin-based trading lineages that arose among the Ijaw developed into substantial corporations which were known as \"houses\"; each house had an elected leader as well as a fleet of war canoes for use in protecting trade and fighting rivals. The other main occupation common among the Ijaw has traditionally been fishing and farming.\n\nBeing a maritime people, many Ijaws were employed in the merchant shipping sector in the early and mid-20th century (pre-Nigerian independence). With the advent of oil and gas exploration in their territory, some are employed in that sector. Other main occupation are in the civil service of the Nigerian states of Bayelsa and Rivers where they are predominant.\n\nExtensive state-government sponsored overseas scholarship programs in the 1970s and 1980s have also led to a significant presence of Ijaw professionals in Europe and North America (the so-called Ijaw diaspora). Another contributing factor to this human capital flight is the abject poverty in their homeland of the Niger Delta, resulting from decades of neglect by the Nigerian government and oil companies in spite of continuous petroleum prospecting in this region since the 1950s.\n\nThe Ijaw people live by fishing supplemented by farming paddy-rice, plantains, Cassava, yams, cocoyams, bananas and other vegetables as well as tropical fruits such as guava, mangoes and pineapples; and trading. Smoke-dried fish, timber, palm oil and palm kernels are processed for export. While some clans (those to the east- Akassa, Nembe, Kalabari, Okrika and Bonny) had powerful chiefs and a stratified society, other clans are believed not to have had any centralized confederacies until the arrival of the British. However, owing to influence of the neighbouring Kingdom of Benin individual communities even in the western Niger Delta also had chiefs and governments at the village level.\n\nMarriages are completed by the payment of a bridal dowry, which increases in size if the bride is from another village (so as to make up for that village's loss of her children). Funeral ceremonies, particularly for those who have accumulated wealth and respect, are often very dramatic. Traditional religious practices center around \"Water spirits\" in the Niger river, and around tribute to ancestors.\n\nAlthough the Ijaw are now primarily Christians (65% profess to be), with Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism and Pentecostal being the varieties of Christianity most prevalent among them, they also have elaborate traditional religious practices of their own. Veneration of ancestors plays a central role in Ijaw traditional religion, while water spirits, known as \"Owuamapu\" figure prominently in the Ijaw pantheon. In addition, the Ijaw practice a form of divination called \"Igbadai\", in which recently deceased individuals are interrogated on the causes of their death. \nIjaw religious beliefs hold that water spirits are like humans in having personal strengths and shortcomings, and that humans dwell among the water spirits before being born. The role of prayer in the traditional Ijaw system of belief is to maintain the living in the good graces of the water spirits among whom they dwelt before being born into this world, and each year the Ijaw hold celebrations in honor the spirits lasting for several days. Central to the festivities is the role of masquerades, in which men wearing elaborate outfits and carved masks dance to the beat of drums and manifest the influence of the water spirits through the quality and intensity of their dancing. Particularly spectacular masqueraders are taken to actually be in the possession of the particular spirits on whose behalf they are dancing.\n\nThe Ijaw are also known to practice ritual acculturation (enculturation), whereby an individual from a different, unrelated group undergoes rites to become Ijaw. An example of this is Jaja of Opobo, the Igbo slave who rose to become a powerful Ibani (Bonny) chief in the 19th century.\n\nThere are also a small number of Converts to Islam the most notable being the founder of the Delta People Volunteer Force, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari. Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin comes from the Ijaw ethnic group.\n\nLike many ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Ijaws have many local foods that are not widespread in Nigeria. Many of these foods involve fish and other seafoods such as clams, oysters and periwinkles; yams and plantains. Some of these foods are:\n\nFormerly organized into several loose clusters of villages (confederacies) which cooperated to defend themselves against outsiders, the Ijaw increasingly view themselves as belonging to a single coherent nation, bound together by ties of language and culture. This tendency has been encouraged in large part by what are considered to be environmental degradations that have accompanied the exploitation of oil in the Niger delta region which the Ijaw call home, as well as by a revenue sharing formula with the Nigerian Federal government that is viewed by the Ijaw as manifestly unfair. The resulting sense of grievance has led to several high-profile clashes with the Nigerian Federal authorities, including kidnappings and in the course of which many lives have been lost. The Ijaw people are resilient and proud. Long before after the colonial era, the Ijaw people traveled by wooded boats and canoes to Cameroun, Ghana and other West African countries. They traveled up the River Niger from River Nun.\n\nOne manifestation of ethnic violence on the part of the Ijaw has been an increase in the number and severity of clashes between Ijaw militants and those of Itsekiri origin, particularly in the town of Warri.\n\nDeadly conflicts had rocked the South-South region, especially in Delta State, where intertribal killings had resulted in death in both sides.\n\nIn July 2013, local police discovered mutilated corpses of 13 Itsekiris killed by Ijaws, over dispute over the candidate for a local council chairman. Several Itsekiri villages, including Gbokoda, Udo, Ajamita, Obaghoro and Ayerode-Zion on the Benin river axis, were razed down while several Itsekiris lost their lives.\n\nThe December 1998 All Ijaw Youths Conference crystallized the struggle with the formation of the Ijaw Youth Movement (IYM) and the issuing of the Kaiama Declaration. In it, long-held Ijaw concerns about the loss of control of their homeland and their own lives to the oil companies were joined with a commitment to direct action. In the declaration, and in a letter to the companies, the Ijaws called for oil companies to suspend operations and withdraw from Ijaw territory. The IYM pledged “to struggle peacefully for freedom, self-determination and ecological justice,” and prepared a campaign of celebration, prayer, and direct action 'Operation Climate Change' beginning December 28, 1998.\n\nIn December 1998, two warships and 10-15,000 Nigerian troops occupied Bayelsa and Delta states as the Ijaw Youth Movement (IYM) mobilized for Operation Climate Change. Soldiers entering the Bayelsa state capital of Yenagoa announced they had come to attack the youths trying to stop the oil companies. On the morning of December 30, 1998, two thousand young people processed through Yenagoa, dressed in black, singing and dancing. Soldiers opened fire with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas, killing at least three protesters and arresting twenty-five more. After a march demanding the release of those detained was turned back by soldiers, three more protesters were shot dead including Nwashuku Okeri, Ghadafi Ezeifile and Onwinkron Ibe. The head of Yenagoa rebels- Chief Onwinkron Ibe- was burned alive in his mansion on December 28, 1998. Amongst his family members to flee the premises before complete ruins was his only son, Desmond Ibe. The military declared a state of emergency throughout Bayelsa state, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and banned meetings. At military roadblocks, local residents were severely beaten or detained. At night, soldiers invaded private homes, terrorizing residents with beatings and women and girls with rape.\n\nOn January 4, 1999 about one hundred soldiers from the military base at Chevron’s Escravos facility attacked Opia and Ikiyan, two Ijaw communities in Delta State. Bright Pablogba, the traditional leader of Ikiyan, who came to the river to negotiate with the soldiers, was shot along with a seven-year-old girl and possibly dozens of others. Of the approximately 1,000 people living in the two villages, four people were found dead and sixty-two were still missing months after the attack. The same soldiers set the villages ablaze, destroyed canoes and fishing equipment, killed livestock, and destroyed churches and religious shrines.\n\nNonetheless, Operation Climate Change continued, and disrupted Nigerian oil supplies through much of 1999 by turning off valves through Ijaw territory. In the context of high conflict between the Ijaw and the Nigerian Federal Government (and its police and army), the military carried out the Odi massacre, killing scores if not hundreds of Ijaws.\n\nRecent actions by Ijaws against the oil industry have included both renewed efforts at nonviolent action and militarized attacks on oil installations but with no human casualties to foreign oil workers despite hostage-takings. These attacks are usually in response to non-fulfilment by oil companies of memoranda of understanding with their host communities.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It purports to be the true account of the life of the eponymous Moll, detailing her exploits from birth until old age.\n\nBy 1721, Defoe had become a recognised novelist, with the success of \"Robinson Crusoe\" in 1719. His political work was tapering off at this point, due to the fall of both Whig and Tory party leaders with whom he had been associated; Robert Walpole was beginning his rise, and Defoe was never fully at home with the Walpole group. Defoe's Whig views are nevertheless evident in the story of Moll, and the novel's full title gives some insight into this and the outline of the plot:\n\nIt is usually assumed that the novel was written by Daniel Defoe, and his name is commonly given as the author in modern printings of the novel. However, the original printing did not have an author, as it was an apparent autobiography. The attribution of \"Moll Flanders\" to Defoe was made by bookseller Francis Noble in 1770, after Defoe's death in 1731.\n\nThe novel is based partially on the life of Moll King, a London criminal whom Defoe met while visiting Newgate Prison.\n\nMoll's mother is a convict in Newgate Prison in London who is given a reprieve by \"pleading her belly,\" a reference to the custom of staying the executions of pregnant criminals. Her mother is eventually transported to Colonial United States, and Moll Flanders (not her birth name, she emphasizes, taking care not to reveal it) is raised from the age of three until adolescence by a kindly foster mother. Thereafter she gets attached to a household as a servant where she is loved by both sons, the elder of whom convinces her to \"act like they were married\" in bed. Unwilling to marry her, he persuades her to marry his younger brother. After five years of marriage, she then is widowed, leaves her children in the care of in-laws, and begins honing the skill of passing herself off as a fortuned widow to attract a man who will marry her and provide her with security.\n\nThe first time she does this, her \"gentleman-tradesman\" spendthrift husband goes bankrupt and flees to the Continent, leaving her on her own with his blessing to do the best she can to forget him. (They had one child together, but \"it was buried.\") The second time, she makes a match that leads her to Virginia Colony with a kindly man who introduces her to his mother. After three children (one dies), Moll learns that her mother-in-law is actually her biological mother, which makes her husband her half-brother. She dissolves their marriage and after continuing to live with her brother for three years, travels back to England, leaving her two children behind, and goes to live in Bath to seek a new husband.\n\nAgain she returns to her con skills and develops a relationship with a man in Bath whose wife is elsewhere confined due to insanity. Their relationship is at first platonic, but eventually develops into Moll becoming something of a \"kept woman\" in Hammersmith, London. They have three children (one lives), but after a severe illness he repents, breaks off the arrangement, and commits to his wife. However, he assures Moll that their son will be well cared for, so she leaves yet another child behind.\n\nMoll, now 42, resorts to another beau, a bank clerk, who while still married to an adulterous wife (a \"whore\"), proposes to Moll after she entrusts him with her financial holdings. While waiting for the banker to divorce, Moll pretends to have a great fortune to attract another wealthy husband Lancashire, assisted by a new female acquaintance who attests to Moll's (erroneous) social standing. The ruse is successful and she marries a supposedly rich man who claims to own property in Ireland. They each quickly realize that they were both conned and manipulated by the before mentioned new acquaintance. He discharges her from the marriage, telling her nevertheless that she should inherit any money he might ever get. After enjoying each other's company for about a month, they part ways, but Moll soon discovers that she is pregnant. She gives birth and the midwife gives a tripartite scale of the costs of bearing a child, with one value level per social class. She continues to correspond with the bank clerk, hoping he will still have her.\n\nMoll leaves her newborn in the care of a countrywoman in exchange for the sum of £5 a year. Moll marries the banker, but realizes \"what an abominable creature I am! and how this innocent gentleman is going to be abused by me!\" They live in happiness for five years before he becomes bankrupt and dies of despair, the fate of their two children left unstated.\n\nTruly desperate now, Moll begins a career of artful thievery, which, by employing her wits, beauty, charm, and femininity, as well as hard-heartedness and wickedness, brings her the financial security she has always sought. She becomes well known among those \"in the trade,\" and is given the name Moll Flanders. She is helped throughout her career as a thief by her Governess, who also acts as receiver. (During this time she briefly becomes the mistress of a man she robbed.) Moll is finally caught by two maids whilst trying to steal from a house.\n\nIn Newgate she is led to her repentance. At the same time, she reunites with her soulmate, her \"Lancashire husband\", who is also jailed for his robberies (before and after they first met, he acknowledges). Moll is found guilty of felony, but not burglary, the second charge; still, the sentence is death in any case. Yet Moll convinces a minister of her repentance, and together with her Lancashire husband is transported to the Colonies to avoid hanging, where they live happily together (she even talks the ship's captain into not being with the convicts sold upon arrival, but instead in the captain's quarters). Once in the colonies, Moll learns her mother has left her a plantation and that her own son (by her brother) is alive, as is her husband/brother.\n\nMoll carefully introduces herself to her brother and their son, in disguise. With the help of a Quaker, the two found a farm with 50 servants in Maryland. Moll reveals herself now to her son in Virginia and he gives her her mother's inheritance, a farm for which he will now be her steward, providing £100 a year income for her. In turn, she makes him her heir and gives him a (stolen) gold watch.\n\nAt last, her life of conniving and desperation seems to be over. After her husband/brother dies, Moll tells her (Lancashire) husband the entire story and he is \"perfectly easy on that account... For, said he, it was no fault of yours, nor of his; it was a mistake impossible to be prevented.\" Aged 69 (in 1683), the two return to England to live \"in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived.\"\n\nThroughout the novel, Moll goes through a series of relationships, legitimate and not, and through these relationships she bears many children. The lack of character names and Defoe’s inability to keep clear distinctions between his many, nameless characters give the reader the difficult task of keeping track of not just characters as a whole, but specifically Moll’s marriages, relationships, and children, which make up a majority of her life’s story. The following maps out Moll’s relationships and marriages in the order that they appeared in the novel as well as any children that might have been born as a result of their union.\n\nEldest brother\nRobin, younger brother of previous, eldest brother\nThe Draper\nThe Plantation Owner/her brother\nBecomes the mistress to married man\nJames\nThe Banker\nJames, again\n\n“Official” marriages: 6 times to 5 different men\n\nUnofficial marriages: x1\n\nMistress: x1\n\nHusband deaths: x3\n\nChild deaths: x3\n\nChildren accounted for: x7\n\nChildren unaccounted for: x2\n\nChildren she sees again: x1\n\n\n\n\n"}

They can also be found inhabiting the border areas of Sarawak, (especially around the Lawas and Limbang areas, where they are also referred to as Tagal people), North Kalimantan (traditionally concentrated in Malinau and Nunukan) and Brunei. \nThe Murut population in Brunei is mainly found in the sparsely populated Temburong district. They once supplied military might to the Sultans of Brunei. Their population has dwindled in recent years. They are defined as one of the seven indigenous groups that are considered to be Bumiputera in Brunei.\n\nThe Murut are divided between lowland (Timugon) and highland (Tagol) subgroups. They speak the Murutic languages, a branch of the Austronesian family. The Tagol Murut language serves as their \"lingua franca\".\n\nThe Murut were the last of Sabah's ethnic groups to renounce headhunting. As with the Iban of Sarawak, collecting heads of enemies traditionally served a very important role in Murut spiritual beliefs. For example, a man could only get married after he presented at least one head to the family of the desired girl.\n\nThe Murut were shifting cultivators of hill padi and tapioca, supplementing their diet with blowpipe hunting and with some fishing. They live in communal longhouses, usually near rivers, using the rivers as their highways. Most have now converted to Christianity, with about a fifth of the population being Muslims. However they still maintain their culture.\n\nTraditional dress for men was a jacket made of tree bark (Artocarpus tamaran), a red loincloth, and a headdress decorated with Argus pheasant feathers. Women wore a black sleeveless blouse and sarong, which fell just below the knees. Like most of the other indigenous groups in Sabah, the Murut decorated their clothing with distinctive beadwork and also made belts out of old silver coins. Another belt made of reddish-brown glass beads plus yellow and blue beads was hung loosely around the waist.\nMurut wedding or funeral feasts can last several days. Ancient Chinese jars hold a prominent status in Murut customs. Jars are also a place of spirits, and larger jars were formerly used as coffins.\n\nThe Murut have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles - ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs which act as drone without any accompanying melodic instrument.\n\nMurut also used bamboo as a musical instrument, by using bamboo to compose a songs. Some musical instrument like tangkung (similar to that of a guitar, except it has only two strings) is made from wood. Tangkung is usually played during their leisure time.\n\nAntanum was a famous and influential Murut warrior from Sabah who according to local oral history claimed to have supernatural powers. Because of this he was able to receive support from the chiefs and villagers from around Keningau, Tenom, Pensiangan and Rundum and led the Rundum uprising against the British North Borneo Company but was killed during fighting with the company army in Sungai Selangit near Pensiangan.\n\nThe Murut people are divided into three linguistic groups, namely:-\n\n"}

In the 1880s, Naiche and Geronimo successfully went to war together.\n\nIn 1880, Naiche traveled to Mexico with Geronimo's band, to avoid forced relocation to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona. They surrendered in 1883 but escaped the reservation in 1885, back into Mexico.\n\nOfficially the leader of the last band of renegade Apaches in the Southwest, Naiche and Geronimo surrendered to General Nelson Miles in 1886.\n\nNaiche and other Apaches requested to return to Arizona, while still imprisoned in Fort Marion. The US did not allow their return, but Kiowa and Comanche tribes offered to share their reservations in southwestern Oklahoma with the Chiricahua, so Naiche and 295 members of his band moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where they became the Fort Sill Apache Tribe. In 1913, Naiche moved to the Mescalero Indian Reservation in New Mexico.\n\nNaiche had the reputation of being the finest Indian artist of that period. He painted his pictures on deer skin in color. His subjects were flowers, deer, other wild animals, turkey, and various objects of nature, as he saw them.

In 2013, a report on the pilot, 2 years on, concluded that first cohort of clinicians showed quantitative and qualitative improvements in their confidence, their leadership skills, their ability to innovate and their ability to make clinical innovation happen. They produced financially sustainable business plans for £1.2 million of cash releasing savings over 3 years. The programme is now being scaled up.\nFor the individual, retirement – like many other life transitions – can be a challenging time, involving difficult lifestyle changes and choices. This is often compounded by other transitions such as starting to care for grandchildren, relocation, illness, and bereavement. Against the current backdrop of austerity and rising health and social care needs, there is an urgent need to support retirees in managing these transitions. Since summer 2013, after the publication of a report by Lord Wei entitled, \"Next steps: Life transitions and retirement in the 21st century” supported by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Shaftesbury Partnership have been developing a Retirement Transition Initiative, designed to equip people who are around the retirement transition with the information, networks, resilience, and opportunities they need to continue purposeful activity post-retirement. It will aim to improve the economic outcomes, health, and wellbeing of both the individual and their community.\n\nOn 18 May 2010 at the launch of the New Coalition Government policies on Big Society to a group of community leaders, Lord Wei was appointed as an unpaid Government Adviser on Big Society. He was based at the Office for Civil Society in the Cabinet Office where he worked one day a week, and advised the Government on all aspects of taking forward the Big Society and driving implementation across government.\nAt the launch event, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced that Wei would also be appointed a life peer. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 3 June 2010 as Baron Wei, of Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney. He is the third person of Chinese ethnic origin to become a member of the House of Lords, after Baroness Dunn (who is not domiciled in the UK) and the late Lord Chan; the third person of Hong Kong ancestry to become a House of Lords member, after Baroness Dunn and the late Lord Kadoorie; and the first-ever member of Chinese origin to be British born. He is also one of the youngest people to have been made a life peer, at the age of 33.\n\nDue to his role as Government Advisor Lord Wei stepped down from any direct, formal involvement in the organisations he had previously been involved with. On 24 May 2011, Lord Wei announced his decision to step down from his role as Government Advisor on Big Society to help as a volunteer to drive the practical development of Big Society ideas in communities. The Prime Minister, David Cameron said 'Nat has worked incredibly hard over two years to help develop policies that support the Big Society. He has played an important role in delivering key initiatives like Community Organisers, National Citizen Service, and the Big Society Bank.\" Previously, Lord Wei had also cited personal financial difficulties that he had suffered as a result of the demands of his part-time position.\n\nSubsequently, Lord Wei has been involved in a number of initiatives involving networks of individuals who have a vision to improve society, address poverty, and tackle injustice. These have been in three main areas; work to establish training and research to help people, particularly from or interested in having entrepreneurial, financial, and business backgrounds to become active and effective social reformers finding and promoting scalable solutions for today's social challenges, work to harness the power of faith based action, work to promote philanthropy among corporate business owners, to share wealth through sharing ownership to tackle poverty.\n\nLord Wei's ancestry can be traced back to a village in Zhuhai, on the southern coast of the Guangdong. His ancestral home is two villages away from that of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, about whom incidentally, Wei enjoys reading and learning.\n\nAs the only current ethnic Chinese peer in The House of Lords, and the first member of Chinese ethnic origin to have been born and brought up in the UK, Lord Wei takes an interest in British Chinese community issues, particularly in social reform. He is also interested in economic and cultural ties between the UK and China. He is the most senior ethnic Chinese politician in the European Union.\n\nLord Wei states \"Global growth has been powered by and will continue to be boosted by Asia, particularly China and other parts of the region including increasingly South East Asia. Much of Britain and other Western countries future jobs and growth will come from engaging with the East by harnessing its investment and entering its markets.”\n\nHis focus in working with East Asia comprises now of work within the Conservative Party to help engage ethnic East Asian voters and help them gain the voice, representation and participation that they need as Britain's third largest minority group.\n\nUp to July 2015, he worked in Parliament through the All Party Parliamentary Group APPG for East Asian Business which he chaired, the All Party Parliamentary China Group of which he was the vice-Chair (special focus on Hong Kong), and the All Party Parliamentary Group for Trade and Investment of which he was treasurer to promote better trade and political and cultural links between the UK and East Asia and work to encourage the next generation of East Asians and other diaspora to develop the leadership skills to play a greater role in public life, in society, and business, and in harnessing the resources that East Asians have globally and locally both financial and non-financial to address global and local problems today.These groups were discontinued after the May 2015 election. \n\nIn 2012, Manchester local government commissioned Lord Wei to write a report on how Manchester can best engage with China. Following that Report, a Manchester-China Forum was established which hosts regular activities to help member businesses share information and knowledge, including seminars, meet-the-buyer events, and other networking opportunities. Lord Wei continues to work as a non-executive director of the Forum.\nIn 2013, Lord Wei was invited to become a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.\n\nIn 2015, Lord Wei became a member of the House of Lords EU Internal Affairs Sub-Committee. He stepped down from this Committee in June 2018.\n\nLord Wei is a Christian. He is married and has two sons.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17629736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17629736", "title": "Nathaniel Reed (outlaw)", "text": "Nathaniel Reed (outlaw)\n\nNathaniel \"Texas Jack\" Reed (March 23, 1862 – January 7, 1950) was a 19th-century American outlaw responsible for many stagecoach, bank, and train robberies throughout the American Southwest during the 1880s and '90s. He acted on his own and also led a bandit gang, operating particularly in the Rocky Mountains and Indian Territory.\n\nReed is claimed to have been the last survivor of the \"47 most notorious outlaws\" of Indian Territory. He became an evangelist in his later years, and could often be seen on the streets of Tulsa preaching against the dangers of following a \"life of crime\". His memoirs were published in the 1930s, and are considered valuable collectors' items (one copy was reportedly sold on the internet for $1,500 in 2007). He claimed to have ridden with the Dalton gang, Bill Doolin, Henry Starr and other outlaws and bandits of the old west. He may have also helped Cherokee Bill, a fellow outlaw from the Indian Territory, in his escape from Fort Smith during the 1880s.\n\nAs with many others of the era, Reed's colorful stories of his almost 10-year career as an outlaw were probably exaggerated by later writers. He claimed to have ridden briefly with the Daltons, and participated in their dual bank robberies in Coffeyville in 1892, as well as in the infamous 1893 gunfight at Ingalls. However, there is no corroborating evidence that he was involved in either of those events.\n\nReed was born in Madison County, Arkansas. His father, Mason Henry Reed, was killed in action fighting for the Union Army during the American Civil War, probably at the Battle of Campbell's Station on November 16, 1863. His mother was Sarah Elizabeth Prater. Reed lived with a number of relatives, including his maternal grandparents, until 1883 when, at the age of 21, he moved to the American frontier. He worked at various jobs in Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas until he reached Oklahoma, where he became a ranch hand for the Tarry outfit.\n\nDuring the summer of 1885, his foreman recruited him to rob a train at La Junta, Colorado. In the course of the robbery, Reed entered the passenger car firing his pistol to keep the passengers under control. He later received $6,000 for his part in the hold up. Encouraged by this success, Reed gave up working as a cowboy and became an outlaw. During the next nine years he and his gang robbed trains, stagecoaches, banks and, on one occasion, captured a large shipment of bullion in California.\n\nDuring the early 1890s, when he was living near Muskogee, Oklahoma, Reed learned that a gold shipment was leaving Dallas, Texas on November 13, 1894. He recruited Buz Luckey, William \"Will\" Smith and Tom Root, and selected Blackstone Switch at Wybark as the site for the robbery. The plan was for Reed to throw the switch as the train approached then, as it entered onto a sidetrack, the gang would use dynamite to enter the express car. Root, a full-blooded Cherokee known for his size and strength, would enter the express car, break open the strong boxes, and bring out the gold. Smith would hold a gun on the engineer and fireman while Luckey stayed with the horses.\n\nDespite their practice staged-robbery the previous day, as the \"Katy No. 2\" approached, Reed threw the switch too early. Engineer Joseph Hotchkiss stopped the train when he saw the signal light change, far short of the siding. Reed and the others were forced to run towards the train yelling and shooting. Hotchkiss and the fireman alerted the messengers using the bell cord connected to the car and jumped off the train to hide in a small ravine nearby.\n\nThe railroad company had anticipated the possibility of a robbery, and had moved the gold to another train, putting in its place several armed messengers to guard the express car including Bud Ledbetter, Paden Tolbert, Sid Johnson, Frank Jones. When Reed and the others approached the express car, he called for the messengers to leave the car. When they refused, Reed and Root took cover behind some trees and began shooting into the car. The messengers returned fire, resulting in a gunfight that lasted for nearly an hour. Eventually one of Reed's men was killed; Reed jumped onto the train and went through the passenger cars forcing passengers to put their valuables into a sack before he and his gang fled.\n\nAs they rode away, Reed was shot by Bud Ledbetter; the pain from his wound grew so severe that his partners were forced to leave him behind for the night. He gave them some of his loot, and kept the rest of it in a sack to use as a pillow. He lay on a blanket hiding under a rock ledge until he was found by an Indian woman, who nursed him back to health.\n\nThe American Express Company offered a reward of $250 for the arrest and conviction of each member of the gang. An extensive manhunt was conducted by U.S. Marshals George Crump and S. Morton Rutherford, and large groups of deputies were sent into the Indian Territory and Creek Nation. While burning the canebrakes in the Verdigris bottoms, one deputy found the burnt remains of Reed's saddle and threatened to destroy the crops of local residents if they did not turn over Reed and his men. This was considered a legal act, authorized by \"The Hanging Judge\" Isaac Parker himself, but no one came forward with information. Reed was warned of the search and decided to leave the territory as soon as he was able. He arrived in Seneca, Missouri on December 9, where Bill Lawrence took care of him.\n\nOnce fully recovered from his wounds Reed returned to Arkansas in February 1895, where he stayed with his brother in Madison County. Having decided to retire from a life of crime, he wrote to Judge Isaac Parker, agreeing to testify against the man who planned the robbery in exchange for probation, although he did not participate in the proceedings. Smith managed to disappear, but U.S. Marshal Newton LaForce was successful in tracking down Luckey and Root to the latter's home in Broken Arrow, 15 miles south of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The two fugitives were subsequently killed in a gunfight with LaForce and his men on December 4, 1894.\n\nDespite Parker's promise of immunity, Reed was convicted and sentenced to serve five years in prison. However, he served less than one, as shortly before his own death Parker granted Reed his parole, in November 1896. Reed subsequently carried his signed parole from Judge Parker around with him, along with a letter signed by Ledbetter acknowledging that Ledbetter had shot him.\n\nAfter his release Reed became an evangelist, preaching the rewards of living a respectable, law-abiding life. He also toured the country with a series of Wild West shows. His memoirs, \"The Life of Texas Jack\", were published in 1936, and 35,000 copies of several published pamphlets and dime novels describing his life as an outlaw were sold before his death at home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the age of 87. He was buried in St. Paul, Arkansas.\n\n\n\n"}

During her childhood, FitzGeorge's parents allowed her to perform in plays for charitable events despite the misgivings of her great-grandmother Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge, and her grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge.\n\nFitzGeorge was married first to Charles Edward \"Archibald\" Watkin Hamilton (later Sir Archibald Hamilton, 5th Baronet) in 1897. FitzGeorge was known for her lavish lifestyle, and she continued her extravagant behavior throughout the course of this marriage, which increased her husband's debts and caused marital strife when Hamilton attempted to limit her expenditures. In order to achieve financial independence, FitzGeorge established a manicure and beauty salon on New Bond Street in London despite its annoyance to both the Hamilton family and the British royal family. FitzGeorge's first marriage, which ended in a highly-publicized divorce in 1902, produced two children: a son, \"George\" Edward Archibald Augustus FitzGeorge Hamilton, in 1898 and an unnamed daughter who died shortly after her birth. FitzGeorge's son died in 1918 while serving with the Grenadier Guards in France during World War I.\n\nFitzGeorge married lawyer Robert Charlton Lane in 1905, and the couple had a daughter, Mary Alice Olga Sofia \"Jane\" Lane Hohler Scrivener, in 1919. In 1908 FitzGeorge made headlines for her alleged affair with Arthur Clark Kennedy and was named in his divorce proceedings with his second wife. FitzGeorge died of an embolism at age 51 in Rouen, France, in 1928 and was interred at her Glebe Manor estate in Warblington, Hampshire. In her will, she bequeathed £1,000 to Winchester College for the establishment of the George FitzGeorge Hamilton Fund to assist in the education of the children of Wykehamists who died in World WarI. FitzGeorge's daughter Jane, who later married British ambassador Ronald Stratford Scrivener, died in 2014.\n\nOlga Mary Adelaide FitzGeorge was born on 11 June 1877 as the daughter and only child of Rear Admiral Sir Adolphus FitzGeorge (1846–1922) and his first wife Sophia Jane Holden FitzGeorge (1857–1920). She was born in Athens, where her father was serving with the Mediterranean Fleet of the Royal Navy. FitzGeorge was named for her two godmothers: the queen consort in her birthplace, Queen Olga of Greece (1851–1926), and her great aunt Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck (1833–1897). Queen Olga gifted FitzGeorge with a pearl heart at her baptism.\n\nThrough her father, FitzGeorge was a granddaughter of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge (1819–1904), Commander-in-Chief of the Forces from 1856 to 1895, and his wife Sarah Fairbrother (1816–1890). Because her paternal grandparents' marriage was in contravention to the Royal Marriages Act of 1772, FitzGeorge's father and her uncles Colonel George FitzGeorge (1843–1907) and Colonel Sir Augustus FitzGeorge (1847–1933) were ineligible to inherit the Dukedom of Cambridge. Also through her father, FitzGeorge was a male-line descendant of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge (1774–1850) and King George III (1738–1820). As a descendant of GeorgeIII, FitzGeorge was also a first cousin twice-removed of Queen Victoria (1819–1901) and a first cousin once-removed of Queen Mary (1867–1953), who was the daughter of her godmother the Duchess of Teck. Through her mother, FitzGeorge was the granddaughter of Thomas Holden and his wife Penelope Sofiano Holden. Holden was a wealthy businessman from whom FitzGeorge's parents received much of their fortune.\n\nAs a child, FitzGeorge's parents allowed her to perform in plays and musicals for the benefit of charitable causes. In June 1882 she and her father performed in three plays at the Corn Exchange in Newark-on-Trent to raise funds for the construction of a local hospital there.\n\nFitzGeorge's grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge, was urged by his mother Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge, to interfere in FitzGeorge's upbringing by her parents, and discouraged them from allowing her to participate in performances and public events. In 1884 the Duke worried about FitzGeorge's presence at a charity bazaar hosted by her mother at St James's Palace, despite it being patronized by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and his wife Alexandra, Princess of Wales. The Duke wrote to FitzGeorge's father on 15 July 1884, insisting that she should be \"quietly dressed\" at the bazaar and that \"appearing on the stage is not desirable for this nice little girl\".\n\nIn 1886 Olga served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of her maternal aunt Hélène Cecil Holden to John Louis Mitchell. She also attended a state ball hosted by Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace in May 1895.\n\nFitzGeorge was married first to Charles Edward \"Archibald\" Watkin Hamilton (10 December 187618 March 1939), later to become Sir Archibald Hamilton, 5th Baronet, on 18 December 1897. Hamilton was the son of Sir Edward Archibald Hamilton, 4th Baronet, and his wife Mary Elizabeth Gill.\n\nTheir wedding was held at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, Belgravia, and the wedding ceremony was presided over by Reverend Edgar Sheppard, Sub-Dean of the Chapels Royal, who was assisted by FitzGeorge's great uncle Reverend Anthony Bailey and parish vicar Reverend John Storrs. FitzGeorge was given away by her father, and was attended by her cousins George FitzGeorge and Guy Holden and by eight bridesmaids: Violet Hodgson (her cousin), Baroness Fay deSteigar (Hamilton's cousin), Stella Faudel-Phillips, Wynford \"Winnie\" Kemball (daughter of General Arnold Burrowes Kemball), Lady Mary Pery, Lady Evelyn Bertie, and FitzGeorge's young cousins Iris and Daphne FitzGeorge. Hamilton's best man was a Mr.Earle.\n\nFitzGeorge's veil of Honiton lace was a family heirloom previously worn by her mother, and was ornamented with orange blossoms specially sent from Cannes. She only wore one jewel, which was the pearl heart given to her at her baptism by her godmother Queen Olga of Greece. The train of her dress was carried by her pages, who wore sailor uniforms and hats labeled with \"H.M.S. Olga.\" The wedding reception was held at the home of FitzGeorge's parents at 12Eaton Square, Belgravia, and the couple honeymooned in Paris afterward.\n\nAttendees at their wedding included FitzGeorge's grandfather the Duke of Cambridge, her uncle Colonel George FitzGeorge, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duchess of York, the Count and Countess of Casa Valencia, the Countess of Cottenham and her daughter Lady Mary Pepys, the Dowager Countess of Limerick, and her daughter Lady Florence Pery, the Countess of Lindsey, the Count and Countess deMorel, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke and Duchess of Stackpoole, the Baron and Baroness deSteigar, Sir Walter Barttelot, 2nd Baronet, and Lady Barttelot, General Sir Henry de Bathe, 4th Baronet, and Lady deBathe, Lieutenant-General Julian Hall, and Admiral Sir Reginald Macdonald and Lady Macdonald.\n\nFitzGeorge received a gold chain bracelet with sapphires and diamonds from the Prince and Princess of Wales; a diamond and green enamel double horseshoe brooch from her godmother Queen Olga of Greece; a diamond pendant from her grandfather the Duke of Cambridge; a white Brussels lace fan from Prince George, Duke of York and Mary, Duchess of York; a bottle of perfume in a silver case from Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; a white gauze fan inlaid with gold from her great aunt Augusta, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; two gold bangles with diamond pendants from Prince Victor Duleep Singh; a green enamel and gold muff chain from the Prince and Princess of Löwenstein-Wertheim; and a silver sugar caster from Prince Adolphus of Teck, Princess Adolphus of Teck, and Prince Alexander of Teck. Prince Adolphus and Prince Alexander were the sons of FitzGeorge's great aunt and godmother, the Duchess of Teck, who died the October preceding her wedding.\n\nAfter their wedding, FitzGeorge and Hamilton resided at Rotherhill in Midhurst, Sussex. The following year, FitzGeorge and her husband held a celebration in honor of her grandfather the Duke of Cambridge at their residence in July 1898, which included Prince and Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Maurice Gifford, and Sir Edward Archibald Hamilton, 4th Baronet.\n\nFitzGeorge and Hamilton had two children together: \"George\" Edward Archibald Augustus FitzGeorge Hamilton (30 December 189818 May 1918) and an unnamed daughter who was born and died on 5 May 1902. At the baptism of their son George, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of York stood as sponsors in person. In 1900 a photographic portrait of FitzGeorge with her grandfather, father, and her son George on her knee, which was entitled \"Four Generations\" was published in multiple periodicals in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nPrior to their marriage, FitzGeorge was known for her lavish lifestyle. She continued her extravagant behavior throughout the course of the marriage, which increased her husband's debts and caused marital strife when Hamilton attempted to limit her expenditures. In order to attain financial independence from Hamilton, FitzGeorge established a manicure and beauty salon on New Bond Street in London with her married name over the establishment's front door. Her business proved to be an annoyance for both her husband's family and the British royal family. Following its opening, Hamilton left and separated from FitzGeorge. In May 1901 Hamilton returned to his parents' residence at Devonshire Place while FitzGeorge resided at their marital residence at 15Queens Mansions, Victoria Street in Victoria, London. Hamilton occasionally visited his wife and child, but his visits eventually ceased.\n\nIn response to his desertion, FitzGeorge filed for and was granted a decree of restitution of conjugal rights by Sir Francis Jeune in a divorce court on 28 July 1902. FitzGeorge was also granted custody of their son, George. Despite efforts by the royal family to reconcile FitzGeorge with her husband, she filed a petition for divorce from Hamilton. FitzGeorge was granted a divorce from Hamilton on 3 November 1902 on the grounds that her husband had abandoned FitzGeorge and engaged in extramarital misconduct with an unknown woman. Several of their wedding guests were present in the courtroom for their divorce ruling.\n\nThree years later, FitzGeorge married lawyer Robert Charlton Lane (26 January 187323 May 1943), son of Charles Thomas Lane, on 5 January 1905 in London. Following their marriage, FitzGeorge frequently traveled to New York. FitzGeorge and Lane had a residence at 1South Eaton Place in Belgravia and an estate named Glebe Manor in Warblington near Havant in Hampshire.\n\nIn early 1908 FitzGeorge became involved in a divorce proceeding in Edinburgh between Arthur Clark Kennedy and his second wife, partly due to FitzGeorge's alleged relationship with Kennedy. Kennedy's wife claimed that FitzGeorge and Kennedy had traveled together to cities in Great Britain, Ireland, and France in 1906, and resided together in Bury St Edmunds in March and April of that year. FitzGeorge's own mother wrote a letter of sympathy to Kennedy's wife in which she stated, \"I find we have no power to stop Olga's money. We cannot stop anybody doing anything, but can only pray for the best. Take care of yourself.\" Kennedy was not present for the divorce proceeding, and his wife was ultimately granted a divorce. Throughout the trial, FitzGeorge vacationed in Jamaica.\n\nIn 1916, during World War I, FitzGeorge's son George entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and in late 1917 he obtained a commission as a Second lieutenant in the British Army's Grenadier Guards, in which his great-grandfather the Duke of Cambridge had served. Only a few months later, on 18 May 1918, George was killed by a bomb from an airplane at Warlincourt near Arras, France. He was interred at Warlincourt Halte British Cemetery near Saulty.\n\nFollowing the war, FitzGeorge and Lane became the parents of a daughter, Mary Alice Olga Sofia \"Jane\" Lane (4 June 191920 September 2014). FitzGeorge's mother Sophia died on 3 February 1920. She bequeathed certain items of jewellery (a gold bracelet that had belonged to Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge, and other diamond ornaments) in life interest to FitzGeorge with the remainder to Jane. FitzGeorge's father (at the age of 76) married \"Margaret\" Beatrice Daisy Watson in October 1920 in Pimlico; he died on 17 December 1922 in London.\n\nFitzGeorge died on 15 October 1928 at age 51 in Rouen, French Third Republic. After a tour of Bayeux and a two-day stay at the Vieux Logis on Rue Saint Romain in Rouen, FitzGeorge died suddenly of an embolism as she was boarding her car to depart for Le Havre. Her remains were transferred from LeHavre to Southampton on 17 October, and she was interred at her Glebe Manor estate in Warblington, Hampshire.\n\nFitzGeorge's will was proved in the Principal Probate Registry on 9 February 1929 by her named executors: her husband and Edgar Oliver Goss. In her will, FitzGeorge left a gold cup presented to her son George by the Duke of Cambridge to the officers' mess of the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards, £100 to the Princess Louise Home for Girls in Kingston Hill, annuities of £15 each to her nurses Emily Hawkins and Nanny Gertrude Mills, and £40 to Robert Walker. FitzGeorge also left £1,000 to Winchester College for the establishment of the George FitzGeorge Hamilton Fund to assist in the education of the children of Wykehamists who had died in World WarI. She left unsettled property totaling £20,150.\n\nFitzGeorge's daughter Jane married first to Edward Christopher Hohler (22 January 191715 February 1997), son of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Preston Hohler and Laline Annette Astell, on 14 November 1939 at Warblington, Hampshire. She and Hohler divorced in July 1961 in London. Jane then married Ronald Stratford Scrivener, son of Sir Patrick Scrivener, on 14 May 1962 in London. Scrivener served as the Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Panama. Jane died on 20 September 2014 at age 95, and her funeral service was held at St.Etheldreda's in Fulham. She had four children with her first husband, Edward Christopher Hohler: Olga Mary Hohler Bland (born 11 October 1940), Philippa Caroline Jane Hohler Sanders Snowdon (born 13 January 1942), Frederick Christopher Gerald Hohler (born 30 August 1943), and Robert Henry Adolphus Hohler (born 2 October 1947). At the time of her death, Jane had 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.\n\n"}

Her father, Taufiq Kiemas, served as the Speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly from 2009 until his death in 2013.\n\nIn 1970, Megawati's first husband Surindro Supjarso - with whom she had two sons - died when his Short SC.7 Skyvan crashed near Biak. After a brief marriage to an Egyptian diplomat, Megawati married Taufiq Kiemas and Maharani was born in 1973. After founding president Sukarno was overthrown by Suharto following the 30 September Movement of 1965, Kiemas spent several years in jail as a political prisoner, limiting the family's economic and social interactions.\n\nHer first 12 years of schooling was completed in Cikini, and she entered the University of Indonesia in 1991 to study mass communication. She graduated in 1997.\n\nPuan is married to businessman Hapsoro 'Happy' Sukmonohadi and they have two children.\n\nAfter the fall of Suharto in 1998, Puan became involved in politics as her mother was one of the main players in the national political scene. During the three-year Megawati presidency, she would often accompany her mother on domestic and foreign official visits, in addition to conducting social events by herself.\n\nIn 2008, Megawati introduced Puan, then head of PDI-P's public and women's empowerment wing, as her successor during campaigning for the East Java 2008 gubernatorial elections in Ngawi. Following that, Maharani ran in the 2009 elections in Central Java's election district 5 (covering Surakarta, Sukoharjo, Klaten and Boyolali) and won 242,504 votes - the second highest of all parliamentary candidates in the nation. During her first term, she acted as head of the PDI-P faction since 2012, replacing Tjahjo Kumolo (who later became Minister of Home Affairs). She was assigned to the DPR's 6th commission, covering investment and SMEs. During this period, she argued against a fuel price hike policy in 2013.\n\nLater, she was briefly put up as a possible PDI-P presidential candidate for the 2014 elections and as a possible vice presidential candidate to Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi). In the legislative elections, she won 326,927 votes, once more scoring the second-most votes nationwide. Following Jokowi's election victory over Prabowo Subianto, she was appointed a cabinet minister amid criticism over her inexperience and her mother's political influence. Her replacement in parliament, Alfia Reziani, was only sworn in by 2016. She claimed success during her tenure, pointing at the rising HDI in addition to lower poverty and Gini ratio statistics.\n\nOn 22 March 2018, former House of Representatives speaker Setya Novanto, while on trial for corruption, testified Puan received a bribe of $500,000 from businessman Made Oka in connection with an electronic identity card program when she was a legislator. Puan admitted to knowing Made Oka but denied discussing the e-ID case with him.\n\n"}

She was also countess consort of Flanders by marriage to Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders. She served as regent of Flanders during the minority of her son Arnulf III, Count of Flanders in 1070-1071. \n\nRichilde is most likely a daugher of Reinier of Hasnon (died c.1049) and Adelheid of Egisheim. \nShe was born c. 1018. In 1040, she married Herman of Mons, who became Count of Hainaut. \n\nFor a long time, Richilde's own rights and position were not well understood. She is counted as ruling countess of Hainaut for different periods in different sources. In a first phase, she followed in the marche of Valenciennes c.1049 as only heir of her father, Reinier of Hasnon, who was installed in 1047 as margrave of Valenciennes to replace Baldwin V of Flanders (who rebelled against the Empire and lost his fiefs). Her first husband, Herman of Mons, count of Hainaut, died c.1050/1051, and left Richilde in the position of \"heiress of Hainaut\". As such,she was actually Countess regnant in her own right in Valenciennes and in her husband's rights in Hainaut. \n\nHer position as \"heiress of Hainaut\", made her an attractive bride, but this placed the County in a dangerous position. She was forced by Baldwin V of Flanders to marry his eldest son Baldwin. It was indeed her future father-in-law Baldwin V who, under threat of force, arranged the marriage between his son and Richilde. \n\nAs Hainaut and Valenciennes were empirial fiefs and Henry III had not been consulted, the marriage resulted in a war between the emperor and the Baldwin's, ending in a total defeat of the latter in 1054. \n\nHer husband Baldwin became ruling count of Hainaut \"De jure uxoris\". Her father-in-law also arranged to disinherite the two children she had with Herman, Hainaut and Valenciennes being inherited by the count of Flanders. \n\nBaldwin VI followed as count of Flanders in 1067, unifying as such Hainaut, Valenciennes and Flanders, and ruled until his death (17 July 1070).\n\nBaldwin VI left Flanders to their eldest son, Arnulf III, and the County of Hainaut to the younger son, Baldwin II, with the provision that if either son preceded the other in death, he would inherit the other's county as well. Baldwin VI also obtained assurances from his brother Robert who gave his oath of homage and promised to protect his nephew. After Baldwin VI's death their son Arnulf III became Count of Flanders, but as he was a minor, Richilde served as Regent of Flanders.\n\nAlmost immediately Arnulf's uncle, Robert the Frisian, broke his oath to his brother Baldwin VI and disputed Arnulf's right to Flanders. Richilde asked for help from William Fitzosbern of Normandy who married her. Despite help from King Philip I of France, her forces were defeated at the Battle of Cassel and William Fitzosbern was killed along with her oldest son, Arnulf. Richilde herself was captured and released, King Philip later recognized Robert as Count of Flanders.\n\nRichilde and her younger son, Baldwin II, retained Hainaut, but made subsequent unsuccessful attempts to recover Flanders. Richilde built the castle at Beaumont along with a chapel there dedicated to St. Venantius. She, along with her son Baldwin, founded the monastery of Saint-Denis-en-Broqueroie. \n\nAt the end of her regency she retired to the Abbey of Messines. In 1076, she was evidently deposed by her son. \n\nRichilde died on 15 March 1086.\n\nRichilde married Herman, Count of Hainaut. They had two children:\n\nRichilde married secondly Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders.

{"id": "828102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=828102", "title": "Shi Lang", "text": "Shi Lang\n\nShi Lang (1621–1696), Marquis Jinghai, also known as Secoe or Sego, was a Chinese admiral who served under the Ming and Qing dynasties in the 17th century. He was the commander-in-chief of the Qing fleets which destroyed the power of Zheng Chenggong's descendants in the 1660s, and led the conquest of the Zheng family's Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan in 1683. Shi later governed part of Taiwan as a marquis.\n\nShi Lang was born to a distinguished lineage in Jinjiang, Fujian, in 1621. He studied military strategy in his youth, and became particularly proficient in naval warfare. After fighting a number of minor operations locally with his father, he joined Zheng Zhilong's naval fleet as captain of the left vanguard. Shi Lang served most of the early 1640s in the Zheng family's fleet, where he apparently saw some conflict with Zheng Zhilong's son Zheng Chenggong. When Shi defected to the Qing dynasty in 1646, Zheng Chenggong killed Shi's father, brother and son.\n\nThe Qing rulers prized Shi Lang for his extensive naval experience and his network of contacts in the major trading ports of East Asia. He accompanied Prince Jidu (son of Jirgalang) on an expedition in Fujian in 1656, and attained the rank of Assistant Brigadier-General. In the campaign of 1663 against the Zheng family, he commanded Dutch ships and men to follow up the Qing victories. In 1668, he submitted a plan to drive the remnants of the Ming dynasty from Taiwan and the Pescadores (Penghu), but the proposal was not utilised. He was given a post in the Imperial Bodyguard and attached to the Chinese Bordered Yellow Banner.\n\nIn 1681, following the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the Kangxi Emperor sought a possible leader for an amphibious operation against Taiwan. Following the advice of Li Guangdi, he chose Shi Lang. Shi Lang insisted on having an independent command, not one shared with Yao Qisheng, the Governor-General of Fujian. On 8 July 1683, after extensive preparation, Shi Lang led a force of 300 warships and 20,000 soldiers out of Tongshan, Fujian. On July 16–17, he defeated the Zheng family's leading naval commander, Liu Guoxuan, in a major engagement near the Pescadores. On 5 September, Shi Lang received Zheng Keshuang's offer to surrender. On 3 October, he reached Taiwan and formally obtained the capitulation of Liu Guoxuan and Zheng Keshuang.\n\nFollowing this successful campaign, Shi Lang returned to the Chinese mainland and worked hard to persuade the Kangxi Emperor to make Taiwan part of China's recognized territory. At the time, there was opposition among many within the Qing government toward the annexation of Taiwan, arguing that its maintenance would become an economic burden on the empire. However, the Kangxi Emperor accepted Shi Lang's views, and in 1684 Taiwan was divided into three counties and established as a prefecture of Fujian province.\n\nShi Lang was declared the \"General Who Maintains Peace on the Seas\" (靖海将军) and given the hereditary rank of marquis. At his own request, he was specially granted the privilege of wearing an honorary peacock feather. Shi Lang continued at his post in Fujian, seizing almost half of the developed land in southern Taiwan for his own profit. Shi annually extorted monetary resources from rich and poor local communities alike, and instituted policies that deliberately aimed to isolate Taiwan from the rest of the Qing Empire – coastal provinces were forbidden to interact with Taiwan, and even people from inland provinces were disallowed to bring their families with them, effectively preventing them from making any permanent foothold in Taiwan. Although he was later charged with arrogance, in 1688 the Kangxi Emperor received Shi Lang in audience in Beijing and allowed him to sit in the imperial presence, reiterating his confidence in him. Shi Lang returned to Fujian and remained in office there until his death in 1696.\n\nShi Lang was given the posthumous name \"Xiangzhuang\" (襄壮), and the title of Junior Tutor to the Heir Apparent. In 1732, his name was entered for worship in the Temple of Eminent Statesmen. One of his sons achieved distinction as an admiral, whilst another was a state official. The Shi family was granted the special privilege of burial in their ancestral cemetery in Jinjiang, instead of in Banner lands as was the case with other Bannermen.\n\nThough famous for his military achievements, Shi Lang remains a controversial figure in contemporary China. He is generally denounced as a traitorous figure who abandoned the Ming loyalist cause for the Qing. As a defector, his exploits have generally been downplayed by the governments of both Taiwan and China, and he is remembered in Taiwan as a conqueror and cruel governor.\n\nIn \"The Deer and the Cauldron\", a 1969 \"wuxia\" novel by Louis Cha, Shi Lang is appointed by the Kangxi Emperor to help the protagonist Wei Xiaobao to bombard the Mystic Dragon Cult. Shi Lang succeeds in the mission, but Wei Xiaobao is captured during the battle by Hong Antong – the leader of the cult – and taken to Russia. Shi Lang's capture of Taiwan is also briefly described in later chapters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5155132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5155132", "title": "Stan Frankel", "text": "Stan Frankel\n\nStanley Phillips \"Stan\" Frankel (1919 – May, 1978) was an American computer scientist. He was born in Los Angeles, attended graduate school at the University of Rochester, received his PhD in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, and began his career as a post-doc student under J. Robert Oppenheimer at University of California, Berkeley in 1942. Frankel helped develop computational techniques used in the nuclear research taking place at the time, notably making some of the early calculations relating to the diffusion of neutrons in a critical assembly of uranium with Eldred Nelson. He joined the T (Theoretical) Division of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in 1943. His wife Mary was also hired to work as a human computer in the T Division. While at Los Alamos, Frankel and Nelson organized a group of scientists' wives, including Mary, to perform some of the repetitive calculations using Marchant and Friden desk calculators to divide the massive calculations required for the project. This became Group T-5 under New York University mathematician Donald Flanders when he arrived in the late summer of 1943. Mathematician Dana Mitchell noticed that the Marchant calculators broke under heavy use and persuaded Frankel and Nelson to order IBM punched card machines. This research led to his interest in the then-dawning field of digital computers. In August 1945, Frankel and Nick Metropolis traveled to the Moore School of Engineering in Pennsylvania to learn how to program the ENIAC computer. That fall they helped design a calculation that would determine the likelihood of being able to develop a fusion weapon. Edward Teller used the ENIAC results to prepare a report in the spring of 1946 that answered this question in the affirmative. \n\nAfter losing his security clearance (and thus his job) during the red scare of the early 1950s, Frankel became an independent computer consultant. He was responsible for designing the CONAC computer for the Continental Oil Company during 1954–1957 and the LGP-30 single-user desk computer in 1956, which was licensed from a computer he designed at Caltech called MINAC. The LGP-30 was moderately successful, selling over 500 units. He served as a consultant to Packard Bell Computer on the design of the PB-250. His last computing project was the SCM Marchant Cogito 240SR electronic calculator introduced in 1965.\n\nFrankel published a number of scientific papers throughout his career. Some of them explored the use of statistical sampling techniques and machine driven solutions. In a 1947 paper in \"Physical Review\", he and Metropolis predicted the utility of computers in replacing manual integration with iterative summation as a problem solving technique. As head of a new Caltech digital computing group he worked with PhD candidate Berni Alder in 1949–1950 to develop what is now known as called Monte Carlo analysis. They used techniques that Enrico Fermi had pioneered in the 1930s. Due to a lack of local computing resources, Frankel travelled to England in 1950 to run Alder's project on the Manchester Mark 1 computer. Unfortunately, Alder's thesis advisor was unimpressed, so Alder and Frankel delayed publication of their results until 1955, in the \"Journal of Chemical Physics\". This left the major credit for the technique to a parallel project by a team including Teller and Metropolis who published similar work in the same journal in 1953. \n\nIn September, 1959, Frankel published a paper in \"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers\" proposing a microwave computer that used travelling-wave tubes as digital storage devices, similar to, but faster than the acoustic delay lines used in the early 1950s. Frankel published a paper on measuring the thickness of soap films in the Journal of Applied Physics in 1966.\n\n\nFrankel, S Phillips, “Elementary Derivation of Thermal Diffusion,” Physical Review, Volume 57, Number 7, April 1, 1940, p 661.\n\nFrankel, S and N Metropolis, “Calculations in the Liquid-Drop Model of Fission,” Physical Review, Volume 72, Number 10, November 15, 1947, p 914-925.\n\nFrankel, Stanley P, “Convergence Rates of Iterative Treatments of Partial Differential Equations,” Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation, Volume 4, 1950, p 65-75.\n\nFrankel, S P, “The Logical Design of a Simple General Purpose Computer,” IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers, March 1957, p 5-14.\n\nFrankel, S P, “On the Minimum Logical Complexity Required for a General Purpose Computer,” IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers, December 1958, p 282-284.\n\nFrankel, Stanley P, “A Logic Design for a Microwave Computer,” IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers, September 1959, p 271-276.\n\nFrankel, Stanley P and Karol J Mysels, “On the ‘Dimpling’ During the Approach of Two Surfaces,” Journal of Physical Chemistry, Volume 66, January 1962, p 190-191.\n\nFrankel, Stanley P and Karol J Mysels, “Simplified Theory of Reflectometric Thickness Measurement of Structured Soap and Related Films,” Journal of Applied Physics, Volume 37, Number 10, September 1966, p 3725-3728.\n"}

The original meaning of Tenjin, sky deity, is almost the same as that of Raijin (a god of thunder).\n\nIn Japanese history, Sugawara no Michizane rose high in the government of the country in the late 9th century, but at the beginning of the 10th century he fell victim to the plots of a rival, a member of the Fujiwara clan, and was demoted and exiled to Kyushu. He died in exile in 903. On July 21, 930, the capital city was struck by heavy rain and lightning, and many of the leading Fujiwara died, while fires caused by lightning and floods destroyed many of their residences. The court of the emperor drew the conclusion that the disturbances were caused by Michizane's angry spirit, and, to placate it, the emperor restored all Michizane's offices, burned the official order of exile, and ordered that the poet be worshipped under the name Tenjin, which means \"sky deity\". A shrine was established at Kitano; it was immediately raised to the first rank of official shrines, supported directly by the government.\n\nFor the first few centuries, then, Tenjin was seen as a god of natural disasters, worshipped to placate him and avoid his curses. However, Michizane was a famous poet and scholar in his lifetime, one of the greatest of the Heian period, and in the Edo period scholars and educators came to regard him as a patron of scholarship. By the present day, this view has completely eclipsed natural disasters in popular worship.\n\nTenjin's influence is now regarded as particularly strong in passing exams, and so many school students, and their parents, pray for success at his shrine before important entrance exams, and return afterwards, if appropriate, to give thanks for success.\n\nMichizane was very fond of \"ume\" trees, writing a famous poem from exile in which he lamented the absence of a particular tree he had loved in the capital. Legend states that it flew from Kyoto to Dazaifu in Kyushu to be with him, and the tree is still on show at his shrine there. As a result, shrines to Tenjin often are planted with many ume trees. By coincidence, these trees blossom in February, the same time of year as exam results are announced, and so it is common for Tenjin shrines to hold a festival around this time. \n\nThe animal particularly associated with Tenjin is the bull because, according to legend, during Michizane's funeral procession, the bull pulling the cart bearing his remains refused to go any further than a certain spot, which was then built up into his shrine.\n\nThe main shrines to this kami are Kitano Tenman-gū in Kyoto and Dazaifu Tenman-gū in Fukuoka Prefecture, and the top three are rounded out by Egara Tenjin Shrine in Kamakura, but there are many other shrines dedicated to him across Japan. These shrines are called . A group of three notable shrines has been called the Three Great Tenjin Shrines.\n\n\n"}

The son of minister Walter Vinson Grant, Sr., in 1983 Grant took over Soul's Harbor Church (located in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas) and expanded its ministry, later renaming the church as \"Eagles Nest Cathedral\". In 1987, Grant purchased in the southwest section of Dallas (near Dallas Baptist University) and built the \"Eagle's Nest Family Church\", and continued pastoring the 5000-seat church until 1996.\nGrant was convicted in 1996 of tax evasion, and since his release from prison he has restarted his ministry.\n\nHe is married to Brenda Gayle Hayes, and has three adult children, Misty, Barry and Mark.\n\nAs of August 2011, Grant's website said about the minister's education and honorary degrees:\n\nAfter attending Southwestern Assemblies of God Bible University, he started in the full-time ministry. He received his undergraduate degrees in English Literature and Religion, as well as his Master's Degree in History from Dallas Baptist University. He has two honorary degrees from Kingsway Bible University (Des Moines, Iowa) and the Colonial Academy (Chicago).\n\nParanormal investigator James Randi examined Grant's practices in his 1987 book, \"The Faith Healers\". About Grant's degrees, Randi wrote:\n\n. . . even Grant's college degree is phony. He claims that he obtained it from \"Midstates Bible College\" in Des Moines in 1972. He displays the diploma on his office wall. But Midstates wasn't then and isn't now accredited with the Iowa Department of Public Instruction, as all parochial and public schools are required to be. It wasn't recorded with the secretary of state's office in Iowa as a corporation; nor was it listed in the county recorder's office. It didn't even show up in the telephone directory.\n\nGrant told a reporter in 1986 that he did not graduate from a seminary but, in Grant's words, had \"more or less an honorary D.D. (doctor of divinity) degree\" from Mid-States Bible College in Des Moines, Iowa, which later changed its name to Kingsway Christian College. \"They take a formula of how many books you've written, how long you've been in the ministry, maybe how many times you've been on radio and TV,\" he said.\n\nGrant has denied being a faith healer, stating that \"whatever healing there is, is a gift from God\", for which he is merely \"a mortal conduit\".\n\nIn 1996, an Internal Revenue Service investigation into Grant's ministry resulted in Grant's imprisonment for tax evasion. He was found guilty of failing to report $375,000 in taxable income in the purchase of two homes, including his $1 million residence. An undercover video tape was alleged to show Grant admitting that he used $100,000 in 1988 from church members as a down payment on a $1.2 million home overlooking a Desoto, Texas, country club and not reporting it as income. Judge Joe Kendall criticized Grant for attempting to withdraw his plea, asking Grant, \"Did you watch the same videotape I watched?\" He continued, \"He's all over it admitting he's guilty. He swore to God under oath he is guilty\". The judge sentenced Grant to 16 months in prison and a $30,000 fine, to be paid after his release, when he would also serve an additional year of probation. Kendall also ordered Grant to \"perform 100 hours of community service, publish details of his arrest and sentence for everyone on his mailing list and provide complete, continuing financial reports to the court.\"\n\nHis wife was indicted on charges of blocking the IRS and evading taxes.\n\nGrant was released from prison on September 18, 1997, \"and has since restarted his ministry, again under the name Eagles Nest Cathedral, in the eastern part of Dallas.\"\n\nIn August 2012, W.V. Grant purchased a historic property in downtown Dallas. The former home of \"First Church of Christ, Scientist,\" located at 1508 Cadiz Street, Dallas, Texas 75201 where \"The Eagle's Nest Cathedral\" and Grant now hold almost nightly services normally lasting from 7:00 PM – 9:00 PM.\n\n1986–87: Scientific skeptic and professional stage magician James Randi reported that Grant had been supplied with notes concerning the ailments of audience members before the show, that he used a \"sleight of hand\" trick to make a person's leg appear to grow, and that he had members of the audience who walked into the event placed into wheelchairs beforehand, then, during the service, he asked them to stand and walk. Randi also claimed that Grant's wife first gathered information about members of the audience, which she relayed to her husband via slips of paper in a Bible he displayed during his presentations. \"They're agnostics,\" Grant said of his critics in 1986, \"Or even atheists.\"\n\n1987: Chicago Tribune religion writer Bruce Buursma reported the experiences of one of Randi's fellow investigators, Andrew A. Skolnick, who was twice \"healed\" by Grant and once by televangelist faith healer Peter Popoff.\n\n1991: Grant was investigated by ABC News and Trinity Foundation for an exposé report on \"Primetime Live\" (with Larry Lea and Robert Tilton). A 2006 opinion article in the Dallas Observer claimed that the examination of documents in various lawsuits revealed deceptive journalistic techniques were utilized by ABC News, and concluded that a key element of the televised Primetime Live report relating to Tilton was \"bogus\".\n\nThe Trinity Foundation also found photos of a naked Grant in his trash and published one in the centrefold of their satirical magazine, \"The Door.\"\n\n1996: The Dallas Morning News reported that one of Grant's fundraising letters was apparently written by Gene Ewing, who heads a multi-million dollar marketing empire, writing donation letters for other evangelicals like Don Stewart and Robert Tilton.\n\n2003: Atlanta television station WAGA-TV conducted an investigation on Grant and found that Grant liked to arrive at his revivals early, hours before they were supposed to begin. WAGA reporters showed up early as well, with hidden cameras, and watched the preacher talk to several people already in the church. As it turned out, many of them were people Grant would later pick out of the crowd and \"miraculously\" announce their name and their disease.\" The report concluded that of three people Grant claimed to heal, two were in worse condition after, and one assisted Grant with the setup with no sign of the condition he claimed during the service. In addition, \"healing the short leg\" was a magic trick demonstrated on a reporter by magician James Randi.\n\n2006: Richmond, Virginia television station WWBT-TV aired an investigation on Grant while he conducted faith healing services at the Richmond Christian Center.\n\n2010: \"Free Inquiry\", the magazine of the Council for Secular Humanism, discussed how Grant's act had changed little in the preceding twenty years and detailed his \"miracles\" at a venue.\n\n2011: British mentalist Derren Brown produced a program \"Miracles for Sale\" broadcast on Channel 4. As part of the program, Brown and his team made two visits to Grant's church in Dallas. During the first visit, Grant claimed that \"God\" had told him the name of a member of Brown's team, but the name he gave out was a false one that the person had written on a contact card prior to the start of the service. This indicated that Grant's knowledge came from the card and not from any supernatural means. On their second visit, Grant performed his leg lengthening \"miracle\" on Brown himself. The footage showed Grant using the same shoe-manipulation technique that Brown had exposed earlier on the program.\n\n"}
{"id": "758699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=758699", "title": "William Z. Foster", "text": "William Z. Foster\n\nWilliam Z. Foster (February 25, 1881 – September 1, 1961) was a radical American labor organizer and Marxist politician, whose career included serving as General Secretary of the Communist Party USA from 1945 to 1957. He was previously a member of the Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World, leading the drive to organize the packinghouse industry during World War I and the steel strike of 1919. \n\nHe was born William Edward Foster in Taunton, Massachusetts on 25 February 1881, the son of a Fenian, James Foster, who had fled County Carlow after the failure of the revolutionary Fenian Rising in Ireland and the waves of arrests that drove hundreds of others out of the country. His mother, Elizabeth McLoughlin, was an English Catholic textile worker. During his peripatetic childhood his mother had nine surviving children of 23 babies she bore.\n\nHis family moved to the Irish area of Skittereen in Philadelphia, where his father worked as a stableman and was part of a group of Irish-American Fenians. Foster left school at the age of ten to apprentice himself to a die sinker. Foster left that position three years later to work in a white lead factory. Over the next ten years he worked in fertilizer plants in Reading, Pennsylvania and Jacksonville, Florida, as a railroad construction worker and sawmill employee in Florida, as a streetcar motorman in New York City, as a lumber camp and longshoreman in Portland, Oregon and as a sailor. Foster even homesteaded for a year in Oregon in 1905, although he also worked a series of odd jobs as a miner, sheepherder, sawmill worker and railroad employee during that year before abandoning the farm.\n\nHe was described by American Civil Liberties Union founder Roger Nash Baldwin as \"tall, slender, blue-eyed and soft-spoken\".\n\nFoster joined the Socialist Party of America in 1901 and was a member in the party's Washington state affiliate until he left the party in the midst of a faction fight. Foster then joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1909, when he took part in one of the IWW's free speech fights in Spokane, Washington.\n\nFoster became a prominent figure within the union, serving as its representative at an international labor conference in Budapest in 1911 and a contributor to its papers. Foster's politics, however, were moving him away from the IWW. He became a committed syndicalist after touring Europe in 1910 and 1911, and criticized the IWW for not working within established unions or within the workshop in any event. He urged American leftists to enter the AFL unions, rather than establish rival unions, as the IWW had tried to do. He also denounced electoral politics as a dead end that smothered the revolutionary ardor of these groups by channeling their energies into pursuit of office, with all the compromises that entails. Foster lost the battle, however, and soon thereafter left the IWW and formed his own organization, the Syndicalist League of North America (SLNA).\n\nThe SLNA's policies — direct action at the shop floor level leading to workers' governance of society, but without the dead weight of bureaucratic structures — bore a strong resemblance to the anarchist thinking of the day. That is not coincidental, since Foster was not only lecturing at anarchist groups and settlements, but became a close working associate with Jay Fox, an anarchist with roots in the Chicago labor movement, and married Ester Abramowitz, who had belonged to an anarchist collective in Washington. Among the other members of the SLNA were Tom Mooney (who became a labor martyr when imprisoned for allegedly throwing a bomb at a Preparedness Day parade in 1916), Earl Browder, an accountant and union activist in Kansas City and Foster's rival for the Presidency of the Communist Party twenty years later, and James P. Cannon, a member of the IWW and one of Foster's allies in the internal warfare within the CPUSA until he was expelled for Trotskyism. The SLNA, however, was never an effective force and folded in 1914.\n\nFoster took his own advice and became a union business agent for a local of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America in Chicago. He continued his syndicalist campaign, this time through the International Trade Union Educational League, while obtaining a position as a general organizer for the AFL in 1915. His syndicalism led him to drop any criticism of the more conservative union leaders; in his eyes, organizing workers was a step toward dismantling capitalism. The ITUEL did not so much seek to take power in those organizations in which its members were active, as to steer them in a more progressive direction.\n\nFoster also tempered his politics at this time: he not only did not publicly oppose the United States' entry into the war, as Eugene V. Debs, Victor Berger and figures associated with the IWW had done, but helped sell war bonds in 1918. Foster also remained quiet when the government arrested hundreds of IWW activists, convicting them \"en masse\" in 1918.\n\nFoster did not, on the other hand, become wholly apolitical. The Chicago Federation of Labor (CFL), headed by John Fitzpatrick, was a nest for a number of labor causes: the campaign to free Tom Mooney, plans to launch a labor party, and, most importantly, programs to organize the thousands of unskilled workers in the City's packinghouses, steel mills and other mass production industries.\n\nUnions had tried to organize the packinghouses for decades before World War I: the Knights of Labor had led organizing drives among these workers in the 1870s and 1880s, while the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen had made gains among the many diverse ethnic groups working in the industry in the first decade of the century. In both cases the industry, now concentrated in the hands of a few large and powerful corporations, drove the unions out.\n\nThe war, however, changed things. The demand for meat increased tremendously during the war, while the draft and the difficulty of importing more workers from Europe led to labor shortages that reduced the number of persons willing to scab in the event of a strike. In addition, the federal government had an interest in maintaining production unimpeded and avoiding the disruption that a strike of 50,000 packinghouse workers would entail. This was an especially propitious time to organize these workers on an industrial basis; as Foster said, \"The gods were indeed fighting on the side of labor\".\n\nBefore the CFL could organize these workers, however, it had to work out the competing claims of all of the various unions that claimed the right to represent segments of the industry. Rather than create a wholly new organization, which would have immediately found itself fighting other unions in the CFL over jurisdiction, Foster hit on the idea of creating a Stockyards Labor Council (SLC) that, like the railroad federations that had recently come into being, would fuse all of the interested unions into a single body with the ability to organize the industry as a whole. Foster obtained the endorsement of his union, the Railway Carmen, for this plan then took the proposal to Local 87 of the Meat Cutters, who supported it enthusiastically and obtained the approval of the CFL on July 15, 1917. The SLC was formed a week later, with representatives from all of the crafts — machinists, electricians, carpenters, coopers, office workers, steamfitters, engineers, railway carmen, and firemen. While this body was only a coalition created for the purpose of organizing workers, and would not have had the authority to bargain for them as a single group, it was an important step toward industrial unionism. Foster was the secretary for the SLC.\n\nAnother factor posed a serious obstacle to organizing packinghouse workers: many of the unions in the SLC excluded African-Americans from membership, either overtly or in practice. Thousands of recent African-American migrants from the South had gone to work in the packinghouses and many looked upon their employers as more interested in their welfare than the unions that had either excluded them or shown no interest in organizing them. The SLC, for its part, offered membership in federal unions affiliated directly with the AFL, only to have this offer thrown back at it as \"Jim Crow unionism\". The same pattern of division prevailed among immigrant workers, who organized along national or linguistic lines.\n\nWhile privately convinced that launching a strike under these conditions would be a mistake, and aware that the AFL leadership felt even more strongly on this subject, Foster nonetheless continued to organize as if a strike was in the offing. The rank and file workers voted overwhelmingly in November, 1917 and more moderate leaders, such as Fitzpatrick and the leader of Local 87, used this strike threat to great advantage in negotiating with the federal government and the employers.\n\nThe Wilson administration wanted to bring about a peaceful resolution of this dispute and put great pressure on the employers to agree to arbitration of the issues in dispute — wages, hours of work, and union recognition — without a strike, even threatening to seize the plants as a wartime measure if necessary. While the unions had their own reservations about arbitration, they also agreed to it rather than find themselves forced to strike. The arbitrator's initial award, ordering the eight-hour day, overtime pay and significant wage increases, was a major victory for the workers. The Amalgamated Meat Cutters' membership doubled in the months that followed.\n\nThose gains were short-lived, however. The arbitration award had not required the employers to recognize the unions, leading some workers to believe that the government, not the SLC, was responsible for these improvements in their wages and hours. In addition, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters attempted to claim all of the members as its own, breaking off relations with the SLC. Race riots in Chicago in 1919 dissolved what little trust black packinghouse workers had in white-led unions. Once the arbitration award expired in 1919 employers fired union activists; by 1922, after a failed strike, the SLC was defunct.\n\nFoster turned his attention, while the packinghouse campaign was still underway, to another project: organizing steel workers. The problems here were even more complex: in addition to the history of defeated strikes and the deep ethnic divisions within the workforce, the steel mills were also divided by differences in skills, with the higher paid native-born skilled workers often looking down on their immigrant coworkers, who were often unskilled or semiskilled. Foster proposed a similar strategy, but on a much larger scale: a national campaign, led by a union council of all the craft unions and the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Tin and Steel Workers, that would organize all of basic steel simultaneously. Fitzpatrick agreed to put his name on the project and sent Foster as the CFL's delegate to the AFL's 1918 convention to present the plan.\n\nThe AFL's reception was tepid: it endorsed a special conference to create a committee to organize steel workers, but each international union contributed only one hundred dollars apiece — leaving the committee with somewhat less than the $250,000 Foster estimated it needed. Many unions did, on the other hand contribute organizers, whom Foster used as his base.\n\nWithout the funds to launch a truly national campaign, Foster decided to start close to home, sending organizers into Gary, Indiana, and South Chicago, where they received a tumultuous outpouring of support, in August 1918. The Chicago area was not, however, the heart of the steel industry; the Monongahela Valley was.\n\nBy the time that Foster sent organizers into that area several months later, however, the influenza epidemic had led the authorities to bar all public meetings; the announcement of the armistice soon led to widespread layoffs in the mills. The union no longer could rely on a tight labor market or a federal government interested in labor peace. The union faced other problems: the rivalries spurred by the constituent unions' self-interest and the omnipresent power of the industry, which had turned the Valley into a large version of a company town.\n\nEven so, the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers managed to sign up more than 100,000 steel workers by early 1919. The strike vote, taken in August 1919, was almost unanimous in favor of a strike. When the steel companies refused to meet with union officials, 250,000 steelworkers went out on strike on September 22.\n\nThe National Committee's organizing efforts had produced mixed results: while it enrolled around 350,000 steelworkers during the course of the strike, its greatest strength was among immigrant workers. Higher skilled native born workers gave the strike only lukewarm support, while black steelworkers gave it almost none at all in the Pittsburgh area and less than enthusiastic support elsewhere.\n\nThe authorities attacked with their customary violence: within ten days fourteen people had been killed, all of them strikers or strike sympathizers. Vigilantes expelled Foster from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at gunpoint. Foster himself became the focus of a Congressional inquiry that was originally initiated to study the causes of the strike. In the meantime authorities barred strikers from meeting.\n\nFoster spent most of his time raising money and organizing material assistance for strikers and their families. In the meantime General Leonard Wood imposed martial law in Gary while authorities in Pennsylvania broke up strike meetings wherever they could be found. By November, as funds were running low, the strike was losing steam. Foster and the other members of the committee voted to end it in January, 1920. Foster resigned from the committee in order to allow it to continue its work \"with a clean slate\".\n\nAfter his resignation from the National Committee following the defeat of the steel workers strike, Foster was at loose ends. He resigned his position as a Brotherhood of Railway Carmen organizer, but was blacklisted from other jobs on the railroad. He still maintained his friendship with John Fitzpatrick, wrote a book analyzing the steel strike and founded the Trade Union Educational League, which received financial support from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the left-led union that had contributed $100,000 for relief for steel strikers.\n\nFoster had contacts with a number of members of the newly formed Communist Party, but had not joined it after its split from the Socialist Party of America in 1919. The party had, in fact, denounced him personally during the strike as an opportunist and class collaborator, calling him \"E.Z. Foster\" for the accommodations he was willing to make with the AFL leadership. The CP at this time was still convinced that the revolution was impending; its suggested slogan during the steel strike was \"Make the strike general and seize state power!\"\n\nFoster was brought closer within the party's orbit, however, after Earl Browder invited him to attend a conference of the Profintern, the Red International of Labor Unions, in Moscow in 1921. There he was appointed the Profintern's agent in the United States; the TUEL was later made an affiliate of the Profintern in 1923. Foster joined the CPUSA on his return to the United States.\n\nThe TUEL, like the ITUEL and SLNA before it, sought to encourage the development of left activists within the established unions and unite those already there around a platform of industrial unionism, and to support the militant struggle for workers' rights. In its early years Foster's TUEL pursued a course of its own, not attempting to line up its policies with Comintern or Profintern directives or taking direction from the CPUSA. When party leaders complained, the Profintern sided with Foster.\n\nThe TUEL took pains to avoid accusations of dual unionism; when the Profintern requested that TUEL start building itself as a mass membership organization Foster demurred, maintaining TUEL as a network of activists with no formal membership. TUEL was strongest in Chicago, where Foster and Jack Johnstone had close relations with Fitzpatrick and many other unionists with a background in labor radicalism. TUEL campaigned for amalgamation of unions into larger, stronger ones—an echo of the IWW's advocacy of \"one big union\"—and creation of a Labor Party—which was an anathema to those who remained in the IWW.\n\nIts first test was the Railway Shopmen's strike of 1922, which was crushed by the employers with the help of an injunction that prohibited strikers from trying to dissuade strikebreakers from taking their jobs by any means, including word of mouth or newspaper interviews. TUEL leafleted at picket lines and continued to press for amalgamation of the separate craft unions in the industry.\n\nTUEL also intervened in the internal politics of the United Mine Workers of America, where Alexander Howat was leading a revolt of miners from Kansas, Illinois, British Columbia and Nova Scotia against the regime of John L. Lewis. Lewis responded by ejecting all those connected with the insurgency from the union in 1923.\n\nFoster had enjoyed a close relationship with John Fitzpatrick of the Chicago Federation of Labor. Those relations were strained to the breaking point by the Party's decision to pack the convention that Fitzpatrick had called to form a new Farmer-Labor Party.\n\nFitzpatrick's project presented Foster with a paradox: he did not think that electoral politics had much potential for advancing the rights of workers, much less revolutionary goals, and he had even less regard for progressive reformists such as Robert La Follette, Sr.. On the other hand, he was attacked from the left within the party for his relations with Fitzpatrick and the CFL, which were denounced as too conservative. Even so, John Pepper, the Comintern's representative in the U.S., and those, such as Charles Ruthenberg, who had criticized Foster for his closeness to Fitzpatrick now directed Foster to make the CPUSA an important player in this new party. At the same time the Party's newspaper, then known as \"The Worker\", published a flattering article about Foster in 1923 that identified him as a Communist, something he had to that point avoided admitting.\n\nFitzpatrick began to distance himself from Foster when his membership in the Communist Party became public knowledge. Foster and the CP, on the other hand, had enough influence within the CFL to be able to dominate the founding convention with representatives of various organizations, some of them existing only on paper. When the CP appeared to have taken over this new party, Fitzpatrick walked out, leaving the CP with a stillborn organization. From that point forward Fitzpatrick campaigned against TUEL and the AFL began expelling communists from its ranks with a vengeance. The Party likewise split the Minnesota-Farmer Labor Party and repudiated any common work with La Follette. After a disastrous showing in the 1924 elections, the Party dismantled the Federated Farmer-Labor Party it had created.\n\nThe split with Fitzpatrick led to the isolation within the labor movement. While Foster and the CP had enjoyed a close relation with Sidney Hillman and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, it began organizing an opposition caucus within the ACWA. Hillman declared the TUEL formation to be a dual union and suspended its leaders, including Benjamin Gitlow.\n\nFoster profited in a way from this debacle: he was able to persuade the Comintern to recall Pepper, with whom he had fought over questions of tactics, and the dissolution of the FF-LP was a setback for the Charles Ruthenberg – Jay Lovestone faction, which was largely made up of foreign-born workers and represented the vast majority of the party membership. Forming an alliance with a smaller faction led by James P. Cannon, Foster was able to control the majority of the party's leadership in 1923 and again in 1925.\n\nThe internecine struggles between the two camps was, however, disturbing to the Comintern, which sent a representative to oversee the Party's 1925 convention. A telegram from the Comintern directed the Party, after a vote which Foster had won decisively over his opponent, Benjamin Gitlow, to install Ruthenberg as general secretary of the Party. Foster challenged the telegram, stormed out of the meeting, and attempted to appeal to the Comintern itself, over the objections of his opponents and even his allies in the Cannon faction, who would not accept the possibility that the Comintern could be wrong.\n\nFoster did not succeed in reversing the Comintern's overturning of his election, but did obtain some concessions: his supporters were given control of the Trade Union Committee within the Party and the Comintern recognized trade union work as the most important sphere of activity for the Party. While Foster thought that he had obtained support for effective independence for TUEL, however, he was mistaken.\n\nThe Party's trade union work in this era, however, went from one disaster to the next. Rivalries within the CPUSA led to the loss of the 1926 New York dressmakers' strike, as neither the Foster or Ruthenberg faction wanted to appear to sell out by accepting a settlement that the Party's members within the strike leadership had recommended. As a result, the Party, which had once held leadership positions within every major New York City local of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union other than the cutters local led by David Dubinsky, was wholly routed.\n\nThe Foster and Ruthenberg factions likewise blamed each other for the defeat of the 1926 strike of textile workers in Passaic, New Jersey, in which the Ruthenberg leadership supported an overt Party role in the strike and what amounted to creation of a dual union. When it appeared that the leadership's communist leanings were an obstacle to negotiations, TUEL handed the strike over to the United Textile Workers, which was unable to make any more progress than the CP leadership had.\n\nFoster also played a major role in the revolt against John L. Lewis' leadership in the United Mine Workers of America. John Brophy, a leader of the UMWA in Western Pennsylvania, ran against Lewis under the banner of \"Save the Union\". Brophy might have won if the ballots had been counted honestly, but they were not. Even so, the dissidents retained substantial prestige within the union and were able to establish themselves as a union administration in exile during the 1927 coal strike, running a separate program of strike relief that allowed the strike to continue when the Lewis Administration proved unable to do so.\n\nThese efforts were leading in the direction of formation of a rival union, something that Foster rejected but which appeared to be the only possibility left to the Party. As signals from the Comintern indicated the impending change of policy in the Third Period, when the American party was directed to abandon its work within the AFL in order to form separate revolutionary unions, even former supporters of Foster, such as Earl Browder, began criticizing Foster for his reluctance to form a dual union of miners. As it turned out, Foster's halting efforts to establish a separate power center within the UMWA had this effect in any case, as Howat, Brophy and his allies dropped out of the \"Save the Union\" movement as the CP's leadership in it became apparent. The Party founded its own National Miners Union in 1928.\n\nC. E. Ruthenberg died on March 2, 1927, and his longtime factional ally Jay Lovestone took over his position as Executive Secretary of the party. The factional fighting between the Foster and Lovestone groups continued, but now became overshadowed by the larger struggle in the Soviet Union between Joseph Stalin and his opponents.\n\nA firm supporter of Joseph Stalin, Foster split with James P. Cannon in 1928 and supported his former ally's expulsion for Trotskyism. Foster was made General Secretary of the party in 1929 with the support of the Comintern, deposing Jay Lovestone, who was sympathetic to Bukharin and whose policies of American exceptionalism were anathema to Stalin's new Third Period line.\n\nThat Third Period line also called for creation of new, revolutionary unions outside the AFL. While Foster had always denounced dual unionism, he dutifully complied with the Comintern's directive, renaming the Trade Union Education League as the Trade Union Unity League. Foster and the Party also followed the line by denouncing social democrats as \"social fascists\" and attacking former allies in the African-American communities as bourgeois collaborators.\n\nFoster began to lose power within the Party, due to his imprisonment during the Party's convention in 1930 and his continuing differences with others in the Party over trade union policies. In 1930, he ran for Governor of New York on the Communist ticket. \n\nFoster was nominated for President yet again in 1932, but he suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and was forced to step down as leader of the party in favor of Earl Browder. Sent to the Soviet Union for treatment, Foster's condition only grew worse. A period followed in which Foster was separated from political activity.\n\nFoster returned to politics late in 1935, but was estranged from Browder and those who had risen to power in his absence. While the Party's trade union policies in the Popular Front era was close to what Foster had advocated in the 1920s, the Party's strength was not in the areas in which it had been active during the TUEL era — garment, railroads, and mining — but in the mass production industries with little history of union organization — automobile and electrical manufacturing, meatpacking, longshore on the west coast, maritime on the east coast, hard rock mining and lumber in the west and public transit in New York City. In the meantime the Party began building a small-scale personality cult around Browder and became a supporter of the New Deal and, to a lesser extent, the Roosevelt administration both of which Foster hated. Foster became the \"loyal opposition\" to Browder within the CPUSA while remaining an unwavering supporter of Stalin.\n\nBrowder was removed in 1945 due to having attempted to dissolve the CPUSA as a party. Foster had, in fact, been one of the most vocal opponents in 1944 of Browder's decisions to rename the CPUSA as the Communist Political Association and to propose the continuation of the no-strike pledge after the end of World War II. The entire leadership of the Party came to Browder's defense then; the Comintern directed Foster to withdraw his criticisms.\n\nFoster's letter to the National Committee subsequently formed the basis for the Duclos letter published as the Cold War began in 1945 that signaled the Soviet Union's change in line. The Party members who had denounced Foster and questioned his grasp of Marxism and his mental faculties a year earlier now condemned Browder as a class traitor. The CPA reestablished itself as the Communist Party USA and expelled Browder. While Foster nominally shared power with Eugene Dennis and John Williamson, he had the most prestige of the three.\n\nDuring Foster's leadership the Party took a harder line, both internationally and internally, shedding much of the \"Americanist\" rhetoric of Browder's dozen years in leadership. Foster published a 'new history' of America, which was highly praised in Moscow and was translated into many languages. Of it Browder wrote, \"This extraordinary book interpreted the history of America from its discovery to the present, as an orgy of 'bloody banditry' and imperialism, enriching itself by 'drinking the rich red blood' of other peoples.\n\nThe Party campaigned vigorously for Henry A. Wallace's candidacy for President in 1948 — which failed to produce a viable Progressive Party. The failure of the campaign and the onset of the Cold War contributed to a disastrous situation for the unions and union leaders associated with the Party within the CIO, which expelled most of them by 1950.\n\nIn 1948 Foster was among the party leaders indicted for subversive activity under the Smith Act, but, because of his precarious health, he was not brought to trial. The Party began to implode as a result of these prosecutions, as many Party leaders chose to go underground after the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the first tier of CPUSA leaders in \"United States v. Dennis\", . Foster also presided over a number of internal purges.\n\nFoster supported Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He rallied the party's faithful during the Soviet Union's military intervention in Hungary and Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin at the 1956 Twentieth Party Congress. Foster retired in 1957 and assumed the title of Chairman emeritus of the party to make way for the younger Gus Hall. Like Foster, Gus Hall was also a loyal ally of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe was in Moscow for his 80th birthday on February 25, 1961.\n\nFoster died on September 1, 1961 in Moscow. The Soviet Union gave him a state funeral in Red Square and Khrushchev headed the honor guards. His ashes were interred with John Reed and Bill Haywood. His book Toward Soviet America remains a favorite among American communists, and has been continuously republished by both leftists and anti-communists who see it as scandalous. One edition of the book was published with the subtitle \"The Book the Communists tried to Destroy!\" \n\nThe founding documents of the Progressive Labor Party portrayed Foster as representing the best side of the Communist Party, while blaming reformist and revisionist tendencies on Earl Browder. Many of the small sects of the 1970s New Communist Movement eulogized and upheld Foster as their icon. Many biographies of Foster have been published by American academics and historians. \n\nAt a debate entitled \"The Revolutionary Left vs. The Revolution Right\" between Alt-Rightist Augustus Sol Invictus and Communist Journalist Caleb Maupin, Maupin described himself as a \"student of Eugene Debs, William Z. Foster and Huey Newton.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These cisgender women-only spaces have raised a number of concerns from transgender groups.\n\nThe term gained usage and popularity during the second wave feminist movement. In 1978, the Lesbian Organization of Toronto adopted a womyn-born womyn-only policy in response to a request for admittance by a transgender woman who identified as lesbian. Womyn-born womyn policies held that the nature of the feminine experience over the course of a lifetime could only be experienced by someone who experienced life presenting as a woman. The intent was to create a space for only women, defined not by identity but experience, defined in a way that excluded transgender women.\n\nSecond-wave feminism is a period in the feminist movement lasting from the 1960s until around the 1980s. Some feminists of the period such as scholars Sheila Jeffreys, Janice Raymond, and theologist Mary Daly were proponents of womyn-born womyn policies. These policies created controversy and scholarly discussion.\n\nRaymond's \"The Transsexual Empire\" (1979) is often seen as the characterizing work of this movement. It is known for its view of trans women as privileged men who did not previously live in the oppression of the patriarchy, stating, \"We know who we are. We know that we are women who are born with female chromosomes and anatomy, and that whether or not we were socialised to be so-called normal women, patriarchy has treated and will treat us like women. Transsexuals have not had this same history.\"\n\nJeffreys was similarly outspoken in her criticisms of trans women, arguing that the feminine characteristics they were adopting are simply those that women must adopt to avoid punishment from the patriarchy. She believed trans women adopt stereotypical attributes that are enforced by the patriarchy and were political signifiers of the oppression of women.\n\nJudith Butler, despite being opposed to womyn-born womyn policies, is often used as an argument for them by modern second-wave feminists. Butler's \"Gender Trouble\" (1990) contained discussion of performativity versus performance, which second-wave feminists used to exclude trans women on account of their performativity through repetition of gender norms, which is \"real only to the extent that it is performed\", which was used as a separator from experience.\n\nOlivia Records, a feminist music collective, employed transgender employees, notably Sandy Stone. In response to this, Michigan Womyn's Music Festival's primary owner in 1977, Lisa Vogel, issued a letter to the music collective along with other second wave feminists:\nThroughout the final quarter of the twentieth century, women's music festivals often enacted womyn-born womyn policies. Although transgender and intersex people had been present in \"women-only spaces\" for decades (usually closeted or passing), the term garnered wider attention in response to the exclusion of trans women from the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival (MichFest) after it was described as a gathering for \"women born as women and living as women\". In 1992, a gender survey was taken at MichFest by Nancy Burkholder that asked, \"Do you think male-to-female transsexuals should be welcome at Michigan?\" Out of approximately 7500 women present, 633 responded to the inquiry with 73.1% (463) responding \"yes\" and 22.6% (143) responding \"no\" (the margin of error was 3.8%). Although admitting that the sample was not \"randomly selected\", surveyors calculated the results as indicating that \"less than 1 in 100,000\" attendees would be against the exclusion of transsexual women from the festival; and while the replies about \"female-to-male transsexuals\" were not tabulated, it was determined that \"80% of respondents were against their inclusion\". However, the presence of male-to-female transsexual people at MichFest was understood to exist.\n\nWith the advent of third-wave feminism, objections to womyn-born womyn policies increased. Many women-only music festivals also began to close. The RadFem Collective, which describes its membership as \"restricted to 'women born women and living as women'\", continues to promote womyn-born womyn policies. The statement for the 2015 conference was rephrased in explanatory form to read \"RadFems Resist is a women only, feminist event. Our conference is a space for women to share our experiences as women, to politically self organise for women's liberation and to celebrate womanhood in a safe environment. We welcome all women who were raised and socialized as girls to join us...We are gender abolitionists who have been raised and socialized as girls and women *because of our female bodies* in the context of patriarchy.\"\n\nAfter 40 years, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival held its last event in 2015. This final gathering followed the withdrawal of support by the National Center for Lesbian Rights, National LGBTQ Task Force, and \"The TransAdvocate\" nonprofit website, of a boycott petition against MichFest and its womyn-born womyn intention.\n\nThere have been other instances where transgender women have been denied access to, or been evicted from, women's spaces; for example, the Vancouver Rape Relief & Women's Shelter and Mountain Moving Coffeehouse.\n\nThe feminist sex wars signaled a divide in second-wave feminism on issues of sex expression, pornography, sexuality, and gender identity. It led to many trans-affirming feminist views, and more criticism toward the womyn-born womyn culture that thrived in radical feminism. With the rise of third-wave feminism, the radical feminism that supports womyn-born womyn policies and agendas became less prevalent.\n\nJudith Butler was characteristic in her approach to third-wave feminist opposition of womyn-born womyn politics. The fluidity in gender, a more modern adaptation in feminist thought, is reflected in her views, \"We form ourselves within the vocabularies that we did not choose, and sometimes we have to reject those vocabularies, or actively develop new ones. For instance, gender assignment is a 'construction' and yet many genderqueer and trans people refuse those assignments in part or in full. That refusal opens the way for a more radical form of self-determination, one that happens in solidarity with others who are undergoing a similar struggle.\" This is in response to claims by Jeffreys and others of the time who believed that those born womyn embodied true patriarchal struggle, while transgender women still benefited from the patriarchy. In a more direct reaction from Butler, she states, \"The feminist police comes along to expose the construction and dispute a trans person's sense of their lived reality. I oppose this use of social construction absolutely, and consider it to be a false, misleading, and oppressive use of the theory.\" Some prominent figures in the second wave also readjusted views when presented with changing times, such as Gloria Steinem, who previously referred to transgender women as men with mutilated bodies in the late 1970s, and has since revised her beliefs as stated in a 2013 opinion piece: \"I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned.\"\n\nThe understanding of gender, gender politics, and trans politics has changed over the latter half of the twentieth century and has led to more LGBTQ-led opposition to womyn-born womyn policies and the music festivals that tend to employ them. Kelsie Brynn Jones, a transgender woman and advocate, wrote that \"in [radical feminists'] words, a transgender woman is a \"[sic]\" nothing but a 'self loathing gay man' and they claim that trans women are gay men who, rather than stand up and come out as gay, would rather 'hide' by being transgender, as if it makes things more palatable for friends, family and co-workers.\" Activists for transgender-inclusionary policies often refer to those who promote womyn-born womyn policies as TERFs, an acronym meaning \"Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists\".\n\nIn 1991, Nancy Burkholder was kicked out of the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival for being transgender. \nWith support from the Lesbian Avengers, she and other activists, specifically transgender women, created Camp Trans in 1992 to stage protests outside of the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival against its womyn-born womyn policy. Transgender supporters passed out flyers and held workshops across the road from the festival. Transgender activist Julia Serano described the festival as insensitive and ignorant: \"[The] idea that the femaleness of my mind, personality, lived experiences, and the rest of my body can somehow be trumped by the mere presence of a penis can only be described as phallocentric.\" Activist Riki Wilchins noted that Camp Trans \"was the first time that significant numbers of the hard-core lesbian feminist community backed us”.\n\n\n\n\n"}
