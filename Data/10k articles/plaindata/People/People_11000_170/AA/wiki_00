His nickname was \"\"the sentimental voice of Buenos Aires\".\"\nMagaldi took part in the opening broadcasts of Argentina's LOY Radio Nacional in July 1924.\n\nMagaldi suffered from liver disease and was admitted to Sanatorium Otamendi early in September 1938. An operation by Dr. Pedro Valdez was successful, but the patient died 48 hours later. He was buried in the Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires.\n\nMagaldi is portrayed in the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice Broadway musical \"Evita\". In the musical, Magaldi is depicted as bringing Eva to Buenos Aires and so is therefore referred to as \"the first man to be of use to Eva Duarte\".\n\nThere is some disagreement, however, about the role Magaldi played in Eva's real life. For example, in the biography \"Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón\" biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write that there are no records of Magaldi performing in Eva's hometown of Junín in the year that Eva is said to have met Magaldi:\n\n\"Most accounts of Evita's life say that she fell in love with the spotlight image of Magaldi or that she decided to seduce him and use him; but that, in either event, she was introduced to him, asked him to take her to Buenos Aires, and when he wavered, forced her way into his train compartment and rode with him to the city, thus leaving her family and becoming a married man's mistress. Yet there is no record of the tango singer's having come to Junín that year. Magaldi, a mild man who was devoted to his mother, used to bring his wife on tour, and it is hard to understand what he would have seen in small, skinny Eva María. If he did help her leave Junín, it is likely that his assistance was of the most innocuous kind. Evita's sister insists that doña Juana, prodded by don Pepe, accompanied Evita to the city. According to her account, mother and daughter kept visiting the radio stations until they found a programme for which a young girl was needed.\"\nA major point that detracts from the credibility of the version of the story presented in \"Evita\" is that in the stage (and film) versions, Magaldi is depicted as performing at a charity concert given in aid of the victims of an earthquake in San Juan, Argentina. The earthquake occurred on 15 January 1944, and the concert occurred on 22 January, when Eva almost certainly met Peron. However, Magaldi could not have performed there since he had died of peritonitis in Buenos Aires more than five years earlier.\n\n"}

He remains a force in Rivers State politics.\n\nGraham-Douglas was born on 8 May 1939 in Abonnema in the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State. He is of Ijaw origin. His brother, Napo Graham-Douglas, was the first indigenous Attorney-General of Nigeria, \nHe attended secondary schools in Lagos and Port Harcourt. He studied at Acton Technical School, London (1963–1965) and then at the University of Lagos (1965–1969).\nHe earned a BSc. in Botany and Zoology.\n\nHe started work with the Nigerian Petroleum Refinery Company, Port Harcourt (1969–1977). \nHe became managing director of Togiscani Nigeria, a construction company (1978–1985) and CEO of Road Haulage Company and Magroad Enterprises. \nHe was also chairman of the Binterteco Nigeria, Pabod Finance and Investment and Waterglass Boat Yard.\nIn 2000, Graham-Douglas was appointed Provincial Grand Master of the Freemason's Lodge in Calabar.\n\nGraham-Douglas became Commissioner for Youths, Sports and Culture in 1986 in the Rivers State government.\nIn this role, he completed the Alfred Diete-Spiff Civic Centre, founded the Sports Institute of Isaka and initiated construction of the Liberation Stadium, Port Harcourt.\nHe also gained approval to establish the Rivers State College of Science and Technology.\nHe created, produced and directed the first Rivers Carnival, \"Carnival '88\" with the theme of Unity in Cultural Diversity.\n\nIn 1989 the military government of Ibrahim Babangida appointed him Federal Minister for Social Development, Youths and Sports. During his tenure, the separate Ministry of Women Affairs was established.\nHe was moved to the Ministry of Aviation where he oversaw the deregulation of the aviation industry. He was also a member of the Special Tenders Board, which developed the Abuja FCT.\nSeveral years later, in November 2003, a judicial commission of inquiry into management of BiafraNigeria Airways between 1983 and 1999 issued a report that indicted Graham-Douglas and others for mismanagement and decisions that led to huge losses.\n\nIn 1992 Graham-Douglas became chairman of the Southern Minorities Movement, one of the groups that eventually merged into the People's Democratic Party (PDP). He was a candidate in the PDP primaries for the presidential nomination in 1998, losing to Olusegun Obasanjo, who went on to become president.\n\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Graham-Douglas Minister of Employment, Labour and Productivity in June 1999. \nIn July 2000, Graham-Douglas was re-deployed to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\nIn November 2000 he headed a delegation that visited China, where he signed the 2000-2002 Executive Plan of Cultural and Educational Exchange between China and Nigeria.\nIn December 2000 he hosted the Africa Travel Association's Fourth Ecotourism Symposium in Abuja. He described ecotourism as responsible tourism, saying \"Ecotourism conserves the natural environments and sustains the well-being of local people\".\nGraham-Douglas was dropped from Obasanjo's cabinet in January 2001.\n\nAn elder statesman in Rivers State politics, in 1999 Graham Douglas and Marshal Harry, Chairman of the Rivers State People's Democratic Party, settled for Dr Peter Odili as a consensus candidate for governor.\nBy October 2002 Graham-Douglas was engaged in a very public dispute with Odili.\nHe was strongly opposed to Odili's reelection.\nHe said of Odili that \"he has no respect for good governance and we have a right to call him to order\".\n\nIn January 2007, following the PDP primaries in Rivers State in which Riverine candidates performed poorly compared to Uplanders, the Ijaw Consultative Assembly which Graham-Douglas had founded launched an attack on Ijaws who had served in Odili's government, apparently in a move to reverse the selection of Rotimi Amaechi as PDP candidate for governor.\nThis was a reversal of his position in 2003 when he had said the Ikwerres from Rivers East should take their turn after Peter Odili.\nLater he became a supporter of Amaechi.\n\nHowever, in February 2010 Graham-Douglas disagreed with Amaechi about marginalization of the Kalabari people, claiming problems were due to longstanding government neglect combined with efforts to cut oil-producing areas out of the Kalabari region. Amaechi took the position that Kalabari leaders themselves were to blame, and should do more to develop their communities and discourage militancy.\nTalking of the Niger delta crisis in an interview in October 2009, Graham-Douglas blamed the problems in part on the elections of 2003 when the boys were given arms and used to disrupt the polls. He said the recent amnesty was progress, but not enough. More should be done to provide local housing and employment.\nHe was among leaders who that month protested the poor performance and lack of activity of the Ministry of Niger Delta.\n"}

He is the first and only person to have held this position for more than ten years. He was a candidate in 2013 presidential election and lost, coming fifth out of the six candidates garnering 2,268,753 votes, which was 6.18% of the votes.\n\nVelayati was born in Rostamabad village in Shemiran, Tehran, on 24 June 1945. He was matriculated into Tehran University of medical sciences in 1964. Velayati finished his studies in pediatrics before moving to Johns Hopkins University for a fellowship in infectious diseases. In the meantime, Velayati taught at university and is an active member of such influential bodies as the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, Expediency Council and Islamic Encyclopedia Foundation. During the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah, Velayati was arrested by the intelligence service SAVAK when he was 17.\n\nIn 1961, Velayeti joined the National Front, a secular party. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, he was elected as a member of the parliament from his home town in parliamentary election of that year. He was also a deputy minister of health from November 1980 to July 1981 in the cabinet of Mohammad-Ali Rajai.\n\nAfter winning the presidential election on 13 October 1981, then President Ali Khamenei proposed Velayati as his prime minister to the Parliament of Iran, but Parliament voted against him on 22 October. Khamenei later proposed Mir-Hossein Mousavi, who gained Parliament's approval. In November 1986, Velayati argued that Iran should have diplomatic ties with all countries.\n\nDuring the premiership of Mousavi, Velayati served as the minister of foreign affairs. After the election of Hashemi Rafsanjani as president, he retained his post until 1997, when Rafsanjani's term was ended. He has been an advisor on international affairs to the Supreme Leader of Iran since 1997.\n\nIn November 2006, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corra issued international arrest warrants for Velayati, six other Iranians and one Lebanese in connection with the bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, which resulted in the death of 85 people and serious injuries to 151. Velayati has been on the official Wanted list of Interpol since March 2007, for allegations of \"Aggravated Murder and Damages\" related to the AMIA bombing. The arrest warrant is based on the allegation that senior Iranian officials planned the attack in an August 1993 meeting, including Khamanei, the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Hejazi, Khamanei's intelligence and security advisor, Rafsanjani, then president, Ali Fallahian, then intelligence minister, and Velayati, then foreign minister.\n\nVelayeti was appointed to the Strategic Council on Foreign Relations in 2006. He appears to be close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, serving as his advisor on international affairs and writing the introduction to Khamenei's book \"Palestine\". He attended funeral service of Imad Mughniyah, who had been killed on 12 February 2008, representing Khamenei on 14 February in Lebanon.\n\nOn 30 October 2013, Velayati became head of Center for Strategic Research, being appointed by Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. He was succeeded by Hassan Rouhani.\n\nVelayati was under consideration by the conservative alliance of Iran as a possible candidate for 2005 presidential election, but he announced that he did not accept candidacy of the conservative alliance and would run as an Independent. He finally decided not to run. It was speculated that he did not want to run against Rafsanjani.\n\nHe announced his candidacy for the 2013 presidential election and was supported by some conservative groups. He promised a strong external relationship with community reconciliation, and more diplomatic relations with Europe and the United States. He also criticized President Ahmadinejad's foreign policy.

His first publication, a \"Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the United Kingdom\", was updated sporadically until 1847, when the company began releasing new editions every year as \"Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage\" (often shortened to just \"Burke's Peerage\"). Other books followed, including \"Burke's Landed Gentry\", \"Burke's Colonial Gentry\", and \"Burke's General Armory\". In addition to the peerage, Burke's published books on royal families of Europe and Latin America, ruling families of Africa and the Middle East, distinguished families of the United States and historical families of Ireland.\n\nThe firm was established in 1826 by John Burke (1786–1848), progenitor of a dynasty of genealogists and heralds. His son Sir John Bernard Burke (1814–92) was Ulster King of Arms (1853–92) and his grandson, Sir Henry Farnham Burke (1859–1930), was Garter Principal King of Arms (1919–30). After his death, ownership passed through a variety of people. Apart from the Burke family, editors have included Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, Alfred Trego Butler, Leslie Gilbert Pine, and Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd.\n\nFrom the start, Burke's works suffered from pomposity and carelessness. Readers may have accepted as a minor eccentricity of style the idolisation of medieval figures who were little more than brigands and the ludicrously reverential tone adopted towards otherwise insignificant people who happened to possess a title or were related to a titled person. The major fault of substance, however, was the frequent and evident inaccuracy of the articles. Without much knowledge of history or genealogy, one could see improbabilities and inconsistencies both within articles and between articles. Errors in existing articles remained uncorrected between editions and new errors were added in new articles. A very minor example can be found as late as 1953, where the article on the Baden-Powell barony contained a statement about the relationship of the first baron (died 1941) to the family of the first Earl Nelson (died 1835) which was not supported by the article on the Nelson earldom, because there was no relationship and the statement was untrue. When such carelessness was shown over relatively recent links, what hope had readers of finding accurate guidance over titles with complicated ascents going back to remote medieval times?\nSerious scholars have always taken little account of Burke's books, exposing their flaws from time to time. In 1877, the Oxford professor Edward Augustus Freeman attacked \"in language of almost unexampled scorn, the fables and the fictions\" in Burke's, where he could readily find a pedigree that was \"purely mythical – if indeed mythical is not too respectable a name for what must be in many cases the work of deliberate invention …. (and) all but invariably false. As a rule, it is not only false, but impossible … not merely fictions, but exactly that kind of fiction which is, in its beginning, deliberate and interested falsehood.\" The reputation of the imprint in informed circles was well established by 1893 when Oscar Wilde in the play \"A Woman of No Importance\" wrote: \"You should study the Peerage, Gerald. It is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever done!\" Such barbs had little effect for, writing in 1901, the historian J. Horace Round aimed many blows at the \"old fables\" and \"grotesquely impossible tales\" still being perpetuated by Burke's. \n\n\n"}

Smith co-wrote the book \"Chasing the Dragon\" (1984) which told her life story; its title alludes to Smith's heroin addiction. Smith appeared prominently in the Bob Woodward book \"Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi\" (1984) and was played by Patti D'Arbanville in the 1989 film version of \"Wired\".\n\nSmith became notorious in the Belushi case, but her association with celebrities went back at least 20 years prior to her confession in the \"National Enquirer\". Her earliest acquaintance was with Levon Helm, who later joined the Band, in 1963. In his autobiography, Helm recalls that Smith first met him in Hamilton, Ontario. Helm, with friend and bandmate Rick Danko, was in a band called the Hawks at the time (see Ronnie Hawkins). At one point, the musicians were in Toronto facing a drug bust.\n\nSmith has been connected to the Band's famous song, \"The Weight\" (1968). Smith says in \"Rock and Roll Toronto: From Alanis to Zeppelin\" (1997), that Richard Manuel offered to marry her, but she refused. Nevertheless, she continued to tour and party with Helm, Danko, and Manuel through the 1960s, and at one point became pregnant with a child known as \"the band baby,\" as its paternity was unclear. She later had an affair with Gordon Lightfoot. After the affair ended, Smith returned to Helm and the circle who comprised The Band.\n\nSmith became an employee and then mistress of Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot in the early to mid-1970s.\n\nThe Smith-Lightfoot affair was volatile and illustrated in the lyrics of \"Sundown\" (1974), Lightfoot's No. 1 hit and most lucrative song. It reflects the dark feelings Lightfoot was experiencing at the time, with lyrics such as: \"Sometimes I think it's a shame / When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain.\" Drinking too much and married to another woman, he on one occasion broke Smith's cheekbone in a fight. Lightfoot has stated of his three-year relationship with Smith, \"I was sometimes crazy with jealousy\".\n\nBluegrass musicians Bruce and Brian Good, The Good Brothers, who were one of Lightfoot's opening acts during that time, got fired by Lightfoot for \"flirting\" with Smith. Smith was cited in Lightfoot's divorce papers, and shortly after his affair with Smith ended, Lightfoot was a party to the most expensive divorce settlement in Canadian history to that date.\n\nIn a 1975 interview, Lightfoot expanded upon \"Sundown\" and hinted at the worry he experienced in his relationship with Smith:\n\nLightfoot gave another insight into his relationship with Smith in a 2000 interview when he remarked upon \"Sundown\" being:\n\nIn 2008, Lightfoot gave an interview confirming that \"Sundown\" was written with his then-girlfriend in mind:\n\nIn 2014, Lightfoot added further insight into his writing of \"Sundown\":\n\nAfter Lightfoot and the Band, around 1976, Smith became a backup singer for Hoyt Axton, who was struggling with cocaine addiction at the time. She sang on his song \"Fearless\" (1976) and co-wrote \"Flash of Fire\" (1976) with Axton.\n\nSmith began using heroin in the late 1970s. In Bob Woodward's book \"Wired\", she appears as a drug dealer to Rolling Stones band members Ron Wood and Keith Richards during their touring and rehearsals as The New Barbarians. She moved to Los Angeles and, as her addiction increased, she became a full-time drug dealer and courier to Wood, Richards, and others in the entertainment world. Smith first met comedian John Belushi on the set of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1976, when the Band were the musical guests.\n\nShe later met Belushi again through Wood and Richards, when Belushi contacted her to purchase the drugs that eventually killed him. Smith alleges that she injected Belushi with 11 speedballs (a combination of cocaine and heroin) at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, California in 1982, and that this injection led to his death. According to Woodward, Robin Williams was on the scene at the time and was \"creeped out\" by Smith, whom he deemed a \"lowlife.\" Belushi had been battling cocaine addiction for years and combining it with occasional heroin use.\n\nReleased after initial questioning on the morning of Belushi's death, Smith spoke briefly to freelance writer Chris Van Ness. Then, two \"National Enquirer\" reporters, Tony Brenna and Larry Haley, spoke with her and published their lengthy in-person interviews with her under the headline: \"I killed John Belushi. I didn't mean to, but I am responsible.\" Her revelation led to the charge against Smith in Belushi's murder and 13 counts of administering cocaine and heroin. The \"National Enquirer\" reporters refused to testify at the subsequent trial and were threatened with incarceration by Judge Brian Crahan; however, he later vacated the contempt order.\n\nAfter the police released her on March 5, Smith went to St. Louis on the advice of her lawyer, Robert Sheahen, to avoid reporters. Discovered there, she flew back to Los Angeles. Then she traveled to New York and eventually returned to Toronto. Smith ultimately returned to the United States in June 1986, where she accepted a plea bargain by pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter and several drug charges. She served 15 months in prison at California Institution for Women between December 1986 and March 1988. She was deported to Canada after her release and moved to Toronto, where she worked as a legal secretary and spoke to teenagers about the dangers of drugs.\n\nSmith was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia in July 1991 with two grams of heroin in her purse, for which she received a fine of CDN$2000 and 12 months' probation. She appeared in the \"E! True Hollywood Story\" episode on Belushi's death which first aired in 1998. Smith currently resides in Maple Ridge, British Columbia, Canada.\n"}

He was co-emperor from 409 until 411.\n\nConstantine rose to power during a bloody struggle in Roman Britain and was acclaimed emperor by the local legions in 407. He promptly moved to Gaul, taking all of the mobile troops from Britain, to confront the various Germanic invaders who had crossed the Rhine the previous winter. Constantine gained the upper hand after several battles with the forces of the Western Roman Emperor Honorius. As a result, Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor in 409. The activities of the invading tribes, raids by Saxons on the near-defenseless Britain and desertions by some of his top commanders led to a collapse of support. After further military setbacks he abdicated in 411. He was captured and executed shortly afterwards.\n\nIn 406, the provinces of Roman Britain revolted. The garrisons had not been paid and had determined to choose their own leader. Their first two choices, Marcus and Gratian, did not meet their expectations and were killed. Fearful of a Germanic invasion and desperate for some sense of security in a world that seemed to be rapidly falling apart, the Roman military in Britain sought greater security in strong and able military leadership and chose as their leader a man named after the famed emperor of the early fourth century, Constantine the Great, who had himself risen to power through a military coup in Britain. Constantine was a common soldier, but one of some ability. Early in 407, they acclaimed him as emperor.\n\nConstantine moved quickly. He crossed the Channel at Bononia (Boulogne) and (historians have assumed) took with him all of the mobile troops left in Britain, thus denuding the province of any first line military protection and explaining the disappearance of the legions from Britannia in the early fifth century. The Roman forces in Gaul (modern France) declared for him, followed by most of those in Hispania (modern Spain). On 31 December 406 several tribes of barbarian invaders, including the Vandals, the Burgundians, the Alans and the Sueves had crossed the Rhine, perhaps near Mainz, and overrun the Roman defensive works in a successful invasion of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nConstantine's forces won several confrontations with the Vandals and quickly secured the line of the Rhine. The sitting Western emperor, Honorius, ordered Stilicho, his leading general, or \"magister militum\", to expel Constantine. Sarus the Goth, a commander of Honorius, defeated two of Constantine's generals, Iustinianus and the Frank Nebiogastes, who were leading the vanguard of his forces. Constantine's lieutenant, Nebiogastes, was first trapped in, then killed outside, Valence. Constantine sent another army headed by Edobichus and Gerontius, and Sarus retreated into Italy, needing to buy his passage through the Alpine passes from the brigand Bagaudae, who controlled them. With these advances, Constantine controlled all of Gaul and garrisoned the Alpine passes into Italy. By May 408 he had made Arles his capital, where he appointed Apollinaris, the grandfather of Sidonius Apollinaris, as prefect.\n\nIn the summer of 408, the Roman forces in Italy assembled to counterattack. Hispania was a stronghold of the House of Theodosius and loyal to the ineffectual Honorius. Constantine feared that Honorius' cousins would organise an attack from that direction while troops under Sarus and Stilicho attacked him from Italy in a pincer manoeuvre. He struck first at Hispania. He summoned his eldest son, Constans, from the monastery where he was dwelling, elevated him to Caesar, and sent him with the general Gerontius towards Hispania, where they defeated the cousins of Honorius with little difficulty; twoDidymus and Verinianuswere captured, and two others — Lagodius and Theodosiolus — escaped, Lagodius to Rome and Theodosiolus to Constantinople.\n\nConstans left his wife and household at Saragossa under the care of Gerontius and returned to Arles to report to his father. Meanwhile, the loyalist Roman army mutinied at Ticinum (Pavia) on 13 August, which was followed by the execution of Honorius' general Stilicho on 22 August. Intrigue within the Imperial court caused the general Sarus and his men to abandon the western army. This left Honorius in Ravenna without any significant military power, and facing a Gothic army under Alaric that roamed unchecked in northern Italy. So, when Constantine's envoys arrived to parley, the fearful Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor, and the two were joint consuls for the year 409.\n\nThat year was Constantine's high-water mark. While he had been fighting Honorius' armies, some of the Vandal tribes had overrun Constantine's Rhine defenses and spent two years and eight months burning and plundering their way through Gaul. The tribes reached the Pyrenees, where they broke through Constantine's garrisons and entered Hispania. Constantine prepared to send his son Constans back to deal with this crisis when word came that his general Gerontius had rebelled, raising his relative, Maximus of Hispania, as co-emperor. Despite Constantine's best efforts, the feared attack from Hispania come the following year, when Gerontius advanced with the support of his barbarian allies.\n\nAt about the same time Saxon pirates raided Britain, which Constantine had left defenceless. Distressed that Constantine had failed to defend them, the Roman inhabitants of Britain and Armorica (Brittany) rebelled and expelled his officials.\n\nConstantine's response to this tightening circle of enemies was a final desperate gamble. Encouraged by the entreaties of officials of the western court, he marched on Italy with the troops left to him. They wanted to replace Honorius with a more capable ruler. Constantine, though, had insufficient forces and retreated into Gaul in the late spring of 410. Constantine's position became untenable; Gerontius defeated his forces at Vienne in 411; there his son Constans was captured and executed. Constantine's praetorian prefect Decimus Rusticus, who had replaced Apollinaris a year earlier, abandoned Constantine to be caught up in the new rebellion of Jovinus in the Rhineland. Gerontius trapped Constantine inside Arles and besieged him.\n\nAt the same time, Honorius found a new general, the future Constantius III. He arrived at Arles and put Gerontius to flight. Gerontius committed suicide and many of his troops deserted to Constantius, who took over the siege. Constantine held out, hoping for the return of Edobichus, who was raising troops in northern Gaul amongst the Franks. But on his arrival Edobichus was defeated in an ambush. Constantine, his hopes fading after his troops guarding the Rhine abandoned him to support Jovinus, surrendered to Constantius. Despite the promise of safe passage, and Constantine's assumption of clerical office, Constantius imprisoned the former soldier and had him beheaded on his way to Ravenna in either August or September 411. His head, on a pole, was presented to Emperor Honorius on 18 September. It was later displayed outside Carthage.\n\nAthaulf the Visigoth later suppressed the revolt of Jovinus. Roman rule never returned to Britain after the death of Constantine III. As the historian Procopius later explained, \"from that time onwards it remained under [the rule] of tyrants.\"\n\nConstantine III is also known as Constantine II of Britain. He is remembered as a King of the Britons in the Welsh chronicles and Geoffrey of Monmouth's highly popular and imaginative \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", where he comes to power following Gracianus Municeps' reign. In this version, the Britons ask Aldroneus, the ruler of Armorica, to be their ruler too, seeking a king who can defend them against the barbarians. Aldroenus refuses, believing the country to have diminished, but sends his brother Constantine to rule instead. Constantine becomes King and has three sons, Constans, Aurelius and Uther, but is stabbed to death by a Pict.\n\nGeoffrey seems to have conflated the historical Constantine III with an unrelated Cornish king of a similar name, Custennin Gorneu. This has led to confusion among modern scholars but, beyond their names, Geoffrey's fictional Constantine does not resemble the historical one.\n\n\n\n"}

He was born and raised at the family home of Westport House, County Mayo. He was a direct descendant of the pirate, Gráinne Ní Mháille (c.1530-c.1603).\n\nBrowne served as an officer in the 5th Royal Irish Dragoons from 1779 to 1784. Due to his brother's influence and the support of the Irish catholic interest, he was elected M.P. for County Mayo in 1782, which he would hold till 1800. His uncle, James Browne, Prime Sergeant, was dismissed in 1782 which led to the brothers going into opposition against the government. In time, they were conciliated by the Duke of Rutland's administration. Browne was appointed to the privy council on 20 January 1794.\n\nBrowne supported catholic emancipation but would not help the Catholic Committee in organising elections in the county; Wolfe Tone believed this was because Browne was unwilling to lose any influence in his locality. On the other hand, Browne and his brother supported the government, keeping the administration in Dublin well informed of events in Mayo in the years prior to the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In 1795 the brothers assisted over five hundred Ulster families who fled to Mayo in the wake of disturbances arising from the Battle of the Diamond. All the refugees were carefully questioned to root out any disaffected elements, the families settling on the family estates.\n\nHe was appointed High Sheriff of Mayo for 1798, the year of the Irish Rebellion. He acquired the nickname \"Denis the Rope\" in the aftermath of the French invasion of Mayo in that year for his zeal in hanging suspected rebels. His own home in Claremorris was destroyed by the rebels. Browne had a well-earned reputation as a feared duelist. While Sheriff, he fought against George Robert FitzGerald; another, during the election of 1790, against his electoral opponent, John Bingham. In 1801 he fought against another parliamentary opponent, won, and was returned unopposed for County Mayo.\n\nBrowne's subsequent support for the Acts of Union 1800 failed to gain him a peerage, though his brother was made first Marquess of Sligo. In the following decades he represented Mayo (1800–1818) and Kilkenny city (1820–26), strongly supporting military coercion in Ireland. However, he was still a supporter of catholic emancipation.\n\nHe married his cousin Anne Mahon (died 1833) of Castlegar, County Galway, in 1790, having five sons and four daughters. Two of his sons, James and Peter, also served in the commons from the 1820s. He was instrumental in securing the election of his cousin, Dominick Browne, 1st Baron Oranmore and Browne, supposedly encouraging him to fight a duel to gain votes (Martyn, 2001).\n\nHe died at his home in Claremorris. A portrait of him by Sir Joshua Reynolds hangs in Westport House.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Continental Congress, and a signer of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nTelfair was born in 1735 on his family's ancestral estate in western Scotland. He graduated from the Kirkcudbright Grammar School, before acquiring commercial training. He immigrated to America in 1758 as an agent of a commission house, settling in Virginia. Telfair subsequently moved to Halifax, North Carolina, and finally to Savannah, Georgia, where he established his own commission house. He arrived in Georgia in 1766, joining his brother, William, who had emigrated earlier. Together with Basil Cowper, Telfair built the commission house, and it was an overnight success.\n\nTelfair was a slave owner and a consultant on slavery issues. His mercantile firm dealt in slaves, among other things, and contemporary correspondence of his included discussions of such topics as: the management of slaves; the purchase and sale of slaves; runaway slaves; the mortality rate of slaves born on plantations; the difficulty of selling closely related slaves; and the relations between whites and freedmen.\n\nTelfair was a member of a Committee of Safety (1775–1776), and was a delegate to the Georgia Provincial Congress meeting at Savannah in 1776. He was also a member of the Georgia Committee of Intelligence in 1776.\n\nTelfair was elected to the Continental Congress for 1778, 1780, 1781, and 1782. He was a signatory to the Articles of Confederation. In 1783, during the Cherokee–American wars, Telfair was commissioned to treat with the Chickamauga Cherokee Indians. Telfair was the designated agent (on behalf of Georgia) in talks aimed at settling the northern boundary dispute with North Carolina in February 1783. The land in question was generally regarded \nas Creek land, so the Cherokees readily signed the treaty. The Creeks refused. Although the citizens of Franklin County begged him to retaliate, Secretary of War, Henry Knox, instructed Governor Telfair not to retaliate against the Creek Indians.\n\nHe served three terms as Governor of the state of Georgia. During his second term as governor, he illegally granted thousands of acres of land to speculators as part of the Yazoo land fraud.\n\nTelfair was one of only 12 men who received electoral votes during the first election for President and Vice President of the United States, receiving the vote of one unrecorded elector from his home state of Georgia.\n\nTelfair died in Savannah in 1807, interred initially in the family vault at \"Sharon\" plantation. Later in the 19th century, his remains were moved to Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah.\n\nOne of Telfair's sons, Thomas Telfair, represented Georgia in the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe eldest of the Telfair daughters, Mary Telfair, outlived her siblings and became the benefactor of the first public art museum in the American South, now a complex of three buildings called the Telfair Museums. After her death in 1875, her will also provided for the founding of the Telfair Hospital for Females. Today it is known as Mary Telfair Women's Hospital and is part of Savannah's St. Joseph's/Candler health system.\n\nThree months after Edward Telfair died, Georgia named Telfair County after the former governor.\n\nLater in the 19th century, Savannah's St. James Square was renamed Telfair Square to honor the family.\n\n\n"}

He dedicated the last 40 years of his life to his hobby, and is among its best-known practitioners worldwide.\n\nErkki Rapo lived a rather nomadic, lonely life. He had a series of odd jobs, including stints as limousine driver, club MC and porter at a local university campus. However, autograph hunting was his passion and he never held a job for long. He never married, and his apartment has been described by those who visited it as \"chaotic\". One of his few friends was Jukka Häkkinen who served as Rapo's personal driver from the late 1980s until his death. Rapo was diagnosed with diabetes as a child and suffered from the condition throughout his life.\n\nRapo's celebrity encounters began in 1959 when he met Paul Anka before a concert in Helsinki. Over the following years Rapo made it his mission to meet other famous people in person, and he would spend hours planning and executing his autograph-hunting campaigns. In 1966 Rapo met The Beatles and managed to obtain all four signatures, which is considered something of a rarity because only John Lennon and Paul McCartney are regarded by autograph experts as consistent autograph signers. Rapo also met and obtained autographs from Jim Morrison, Frank Sinatra, Plácido Domingo, Boris Yeltsin, Pope John Paul II and various other celebrities and notables. Tom Jones considered Rapo a personal friend, even though his visits to Finland were limited by his tour schedules.\n\nAlong with the album covers, magazines and similar items favoured by autograph hunters, Rapo is said to have had supermarket receipts, plain paper and other odd items signed. He is said to have regularly carried autographed items with him, and many times he would try to sell these or offer them to a gas station or food store owner in return for gas or meals. Sometimes, if a buyer thought his prices were too high, he would photocopy the signed item and sell a fake autograph, albeit for less money than originally asked for.\n\nAs a result of his activities Rapo became a celebrity himself in Finland. He appeared several times in Finnish newspapers alongside the individual whose autograph he was seeking, and curious readers called the newspapers to ask about him. This motivated journalists to find out more about Rapo, and his life was later chronicled in Finland through newspaper interviews and articles.\n\nIn 1988 Rapo's collection was displayed at the Martinus Hall in Vantaa.\n\nRapo tried to obtain Bob Dylan's autograph on a number of occasions. Dylan apparently disliked this. There are accounts of a 1989 encounter between Dylan and Rapo in Helsinki, where Dylan allegedly shouted at Rapo to stop following him. Rapo nevertheless went the next day to Dylan's hotel but Dylan, signing autographs for a younger crowd, left the area upon spotting Rapo.\n\nIn 1996, Rapo and Dylan crossed paths again, at a music festival. According to Rapo, Dylan told him that he didn't like giving autographs to adults, and stepped away.\n\nRapo did not stop autograph hunting until late in his life when, affected by diabetes complications, he scheduled fewer autograph-seeking dates. Rapo's illness forced him to stay at home for a large part of his final few years, until he died in 2004. His death was relayed by Finnish newspapers to readers across the nation.\n\nShortly after Rapo's death, his autograph collection was auctioned by well known dealer Martin Sinisalo in Helsinki. His biography \"Hei anna nimmari - Eki-Sedän stoori\" by Tomi Lindblom & Jukka Hakkinen was published in 2006.\n\n"}

He is best known for his participation in the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780. Serving as a statesman early in the Revolution, Hambright joined the War in 1777, ranked a lieutenant colonel in a local militia. His early actions were limited to occasional checks on (and some minor skirmishes with) Loyalist groups. This changed in 1780 with Hambright's important role at the Battle of Kings Mountain, which occurred near his lands in the newly formed Lincoln County, North Carolina. Hambright was commended for his bravery during the battle, though suffering a wound which forced him to permanently resign from military service. \n\nA native of the Duchy of Bavaria, Hambright immigrated to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1738. Between 1755 and 1775, he moved several times, first to Virginia, and then to various areas in North Carolina. After the War, he lived the remainder of his life near Kings Mountain.\n\nFrederick Hambright was born to Conrad Hambrecht on May 1, 1727 in Moosbach, Bavaria (then part of the Holy Roman Empire and in present day Germany). He lived there for the first eleven years of his life, until the family immigrated to the Pennsylvania Colony on October 27, 1738, initially settling in Lancaster County. At the age of eighteen, Hambright left his father's home for Henrico County, Virginia. There he married his first wife, Sarah Hardin, sister of Colonel Joseph Hardin, who bore him 12 children, 6 of whom were raised to maturity. Along with several neighbors, Hambright again emigrated, in 1760, to rural Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (in the area which was to become Tryon County in 1768), settling near the Catawba River close to a frontier fortification that ensured his family's protection from Indian attacks. This area was to become part of Lincoln County, North Carolina in 1779, and eventually Gaston County, in 1846.\n\nBefore serving as a soldier, Hambright was a signer of the Tryon Resolves of August 14, 1775, a document which declared that the signers would vow resistance against the British for their actions at the Battle of Lexington. He was a representative of Tryon County, at the Third Provincial Congress, which lasted from August 20 to September 10, 1775. In late 1776, Hambright took part in the Rutherford Light Horse expedition against the Overhill Cherokee.\nWhen the war reached Tryon County in 1777, Hambright joined the colonial cause as a lieutenant colonel of the Lincoln County troops, (locally known as \"The South Fork Boys\"). Hambright was called the \"Terror of the Tories\".\n\nOn May 22, 1780, Major Patrick Ferguson was assigned as \"Inspector of the British Militia\", and was promptly ordered to march to Tryon County, North Carolina to raise troops and to protect the left flank of Lord Cornwallis's main body which occupied Charlotte, North Carolina at the time. By September 10, Ferguson had established a military camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would, \"\"Lay waste to their country with fire and sword\".\" After receiving this message, Patriot leaders Isaac Shelby and John Sevier quickly planned a preemptive campaign against Ferguson's army. They sent messages to military leaders William Campbell and Benjamin Cleveland to join them. The rendezvous at Sycamore Shoals on September 25, brought to Campbell's army 200 Virginians and 160 North Carolinians. Another 1,100 \"Overmountain Men,\" volunteers from the Washington District, also arrived to fight for the Patriot cause. The army met with Cleveland's 350 men at Burke County, North Carolina, and the now 1,400–strong force marched towards the South Mountains.\n\nWhen word of this force reached Ferguson, he sent a message to Cornwallis asking for reinforcements. This message did not reach Cornwallis in time, and on October 1 Ferguson retreated towards the Broad River, asking for local loyalist militia to join him. By October 6, the Patriots had passed Gilbert Town and had reached Cowpens, South Carolina. Local sympathizers informed the Patriots that Ferguson had 1500 men camped on Kings Mountain.\n\nAs they were pressed for time before Ferguson would continue on to Charlotte, Patriot leaders picked 900 men—including Hambright's—to ride to Kings Mountain. By the morning of the 7th, they had reached Kings Mountain, surrounded it, and attacked. The militia's commanding officer, Col. William Graham, was absent during the battle due to an illness in his family, leaving Hambright in command. Hambright's group, along with six units, was positioned at the \"ball\" base beside the \"heel\" crest of the mountain, in position suited to attack the main Loyalist position. The objective was to catch the Loyalists by surprise. During the assault, Hambright was severely wounded from a musket ball shot to his thigh. Although bleeding badly, he continued fighting. Hambright's comrades were impressed with his bravery, and as fellow soldier, Samuel Moore, later put it: \n\nAfter the battle, Hambright was taken to his nearby log cabin for treatment. He survived, but had to resign from service due to his injury, which caused a permanent limp in Hambright's walk.\n\nAfter his first wife's death on July 17, 1781, Hambright married Mary Dover. Together they had ten children, eight of whom survived to maturity. He lived a quiet life on his homestead near Kings Mountain, until his death on March 9, 1817 at the age of ninety. His remains were interred at Old Shiloh Presbyterian Cemetery in Grover, North Carolina.\n\n"}

The airborne operation was personally ordered by Adolf Hitler, planned and executed by Major Harald Mors, and approved by General Kurt Student. \n\nOn the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the Allied invasion of Sicily and bombing of Rome, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted a motion of no confidence (\"Ordine del Giorno\" Grandi) against Mussolini. On the same day, the king replaced him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and had him arrested.\n\nHitler's common procedure was to give similar orders to competing organisations within the German military. So he ordered the Hauptsturmführer (SS captain) Otto Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.\n\nMussolini was being transported around Italy by his captors (first to Ponza, then to La Maddalena, both small islands in the Tyrrhenian sea).\nIntercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit notes with a face value of £100,000 forged under Operation Bernhard were used to help obtain information) of \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" Herbert Kappler to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore Hotel, a ski resort at Campo Imperatore in Italy's Gran Sasso massif, high in the Apennine Mountains. \n\nOn 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the \"Fallschirmjäger\" to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten DFS 230 gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by Henschel Hs 126 planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the Pratica di Mare Air Base near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-Oberleutnant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch entered the first glider, Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close-by Alban Hills the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny's two units arrived first over the target. Meanwhile the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05 the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; only one crashed, causing injuries. The \"Fallschirmjäger\" and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors (200 well-equipped \"Carabinieri\" guards) without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General Fernando Soleti of the \"Polizia dell Africana Italiana\", who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, being followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45 Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini. \n\nSubsequently Mussolini was to be flown out by a Fieseler Fi 156 STOL plane that had arrived meanwhile. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted to accompany Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful lift-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a Heinkel He 111 to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the Hotel Imperial. The next day he was flown to Munich and on September 14 he met Hitler at Führer Headquarters Wolf's Lair in near Rastenburg.\n\nMussolini was made leader of the Italian Social Republic (a German puppet state consisting of the German-occupied portion of Italy).\n\nThe operation granted a rare late-war public relations opportunity to Hermann Göring, with German propaganda hailing the operation for months afterward. (The Axis otherwise had little about which to boast in the fall of 1943.) The landing at Campo Imperatore was in fact led by First Lieutenant von Berlepsch, commanded by Major Mors and under orders from General Student, all \"Fallschirmjäger\" (German air force paratroop) officers; but Skorzeny stewarded the Italian leader right in front of the cameras. After a pro-SS propaganda coup at the behest of \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler and propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Skorzeny and his Special Forces (\"SS-Sonderverband z. b. V. \"Friedenthal\"\") of the \"Waffen-SS\" were granted the majority of the credit for the operation.\nSkorzeny gained a large amount of success from this mission; he received a promotion to Sturmbannführer, the award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and fame that led to his \"most dangerous man in Europe\" image.\n\nWinston Churchill himself described the mission as \"one of great daring\". As it turned out, however, this was one of the last of Hitler's spectacular gambles to bear fruit.\n\nAccording to Michele Vicenzo's researches, based on interviews and supposed contradictions between eyewitnesses and on other documents, the Gran Sasso raid is considered as possible result of a secret agreement between Badoglio's Italian government and the German government. Gerhard Mertins was among the paratroopers who participated in the raid.\n\n"}
{"id": "954192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=954192", "title": "Guatemalans", "text": "Guatemalans\n\nGuatemalan people (Spanish: \"Pueblo guatemalteco\" , \"Guatemaltecos\" ) are people identified with Guatemala, a multiethnic country in Central America. Guatemalans are mainly of Mestizos (mixed European and Amerindian heritage), indigenous people or Amerindians and descendants from European people. Guatemalans are also nicknamed \"chapines\" by other mainly Spanish-speaking countries of the Latin America.\n\nGuatemala has a population of 15,824,463 (2014 est). In 1900, Guatemala had a population of 885,000. Guatemala had the fastest population growth in the Western Hemisphere during 20th century. Approximately the half of the Guatemalan population live in poverty and 13.7% of them live in extreme poverty.\n\nGuatemala is heavily centralized. Transportation, communications, business, politics, and the most relevant urban activity takes place in Guatemala City. Guatemala City has about 2 million inhabitants within the city limits and more than 5 million within the wider urban area. This is a significant percentage of the population (14 million).\n\nThe estimated median age in Guatemala is 20 years old, 19.4 for males and 20.7 years for females. This is the lowest median age of any country in the Western Hemisphere and comparable to most of central Africa and Iraq.\n\nAccording to the Census of 2010 by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) about 41.0% of the population is Mestizo (called \"Ladino\"), Whites of European descent also called Criollo represent the 18.5% in their majority descendants of Spanish descent follow by the descendants of Germans, French, Italians, English, Swedish, Belgian, Swiss, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch, Russian, Scottish, Irish, Welsh and the rest of Europe. And The Amerindian populations include the K'iche' 11.0%, Q'eqchi 8.3%, Kaqchikel 7.8%, Mam 5.2% and 7.6% of the population is \"other Mayan\", 0.4% is indigenous non-Mayan, making the indigenous community in Guatemala about 38.9% of the population.\n\nThere are smaller communities present, including about 110,000 Salvadorans. The Garífuna, who are descended primarily from Black Africans who lived with and intermarried with indigenous peoples from St. Vincent, live mainly in Livingston and Puerto Barrios. Those communities have other blacks and mulattos descended from banana workers. There are also Asians, mostly of Chinese descent. Other Asian groups include Arabs of Lebanese and Syrian descent. There is also a growing Korean community in Guatemala City and in nearby Mixco, currently numbering about 50,000. Guatemala's German population is credited with bringing the tradition of a Christmas tree to the country.\n\nGuatemalan mestizos are people of mixed European and indigenous ancestry. The mestizo population in Guatemala is concentrated in urban areas of the country (the national capital and departmental capitals).\n\nHistorically the mestizo population in the Kingdom of Guatemala at the time of Independence amounted to nearly 600,000 Indians, 300,000 castes (mostly mestizos and a lesser number of mulattos), and 45,000 criollos or Spanish, with a very small number of Spaniards.\n\nThe Amerindian populations in Guatemala include the K'iche' 9.1%, Kaqchikel 8.4%, Mam 7.9% and Q'eqchi 6.3%. 8.6% of the population is \"other Mayan,\" 0.4% is indigenous non-Mayan, making the indigenous community in Guatemala about 38.9% of the population.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, The White population of European descent also called Criollo represent the 18.5% in their majority descendants of Germans follow by the descendants of Spaniards, French, Italians, English, Swedish, Belgian, Swiss, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch, Russian, Scottish, Irish, Welsh and the rest of Europe.\n\nSpanish is the official language. As a first and second language, Spanish is spoken by 93% of the population.\n\nTwenty-one Mayan languages are spoken, especially in rural areas, as well as two non-Mayan Amerindian languages, Xinca, an indigenous language, and Garifuna, an Arawakan language spoken on the Caribbean coast. According to the Language Law of 2003, the languages of Mayas, Xincas, and Garifunas are unrecognized as National Languages.\n\nThe peace accords signed in December 1996 provide for the translation of some official documents and voting materials into several indigenous languages (see summary of main substantive accords) and mandate the provision of interpreters in legal cases for non-Spanish speakers. The accord also sanctioned bilingual education in Spanish and indigenous languages. It is common for indigenous Guatemalans to learn or speak between two and five of the nation's other languages, and Spanish.\n\nThe Civil War forced many Guatemalans to start lives outside of their country. The majority of the Guatemalan diaspora is located in the United States of America, with estimates ranging from 480,665 to 1,489,426. The difficulty in getting accurate counts for Guatemalans abroad is because many of them are refugee claimants awaiting determination of their status. Emigration to the United States of America has led to the growth of Guatemalan communities in California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Rhode Island and elsewhere since the 1970s.\n\nBelow are estimates for certain countries:\nDuring the colonial era Guatemala received immigrants (settlers) only from Spain. Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century. Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom fincas in Alta Verapaz, Zacapa, Quetzaltenango, Baja Verapaz and Izabal. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.\n\nMany Europeans who emigrated to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, families, entrepreneurs and mainly settlers, Guatemala had long been the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind Costa Rica for 1950, that does not mean that the country no longer receive large numbers of immigrants.\n\nFrom the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from Korea, China, Japan, Singapore and the Philippines) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also beginning with the First World War, the immigrant population is being strengthened by Jewish and Pakistani immigration.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew strong in Guatemala, particularly from other Central American countries, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, etc. Although the majority of them resided only temporarily to go to their final destination, which was the United States.\n\n\"* Including immigrants from Taiwan, China, Japan, Palestine, Iraq, Cuba, Venezuela, Canada, Brazil, Switzerland, Russia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, among other countries.\"\n\nThe Guatemalan cuisine reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments of (or divisions), each of which has very different food varieties. For example, Antigua Guatemala is well known for its candy which makes use of many local ingredients fruits, seeds and nuts along with honey, condensed milk and other traditional sweeteners. Antigua's candy is very popular when tourists visit the country for the first time, and is a great choice in the search for new and interesting flavors.\n\nMany traditional foods are based on Maya cuisine and prominently feature corn, chilis and beans as key ingredients. Various dishes may have the same name as dishes from a neighboring country, but may in fact be quite different for example the enchilada or quesadilla, which are nothing like their Mexican counterparts.\nThere are also foods that it is traditional to eat on certain days of the week – for example, by tradition it is known that on Thursday, the typical food is \"paches\", which is like a tamale made with a base of potato, and on Sundays it is traditional to eat tamales, due to the fact that Sundays are considered holidays. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as fiambre for All Saints Day on November 1 and tamales, which are common Christmas.\n\nThere are reportedly hundreds of varieties of tamales throughout Guatemala. They key variations are what is in the \"masa\" or dough (corn, potatoes, rice), what's in the filling (meat, fruits, nuts), and what is it wrapped with (leaves, husks). The masa is made out of corn that is not sweet, such as what is known as feed corn in the U.S.A. In Guatemala, this non-sweet corn is called maize and the corn that Americans from the USA are used to eating on the cob, sweet corn, they call \"elote\". Tamales in Guatemala are more typically wrapped in plantain or banana leaves and mashan leaves than corn husks.\n\nThe ancient Mayan civilization lasted for about six hundred years before collapsing around 900 A.D. Today, almost half of the Guatemalan population is still Mayan. These natives live throughout the country and grow maize as their staple crop. In addition, the ancient Maya ate amaranth, a breakfast cereal similar to modern day cereals.\nGuatemala's national instrument is the marimba, an idiophone from the family of the xylophones, which is played all over the country, even in the remotest corners. Towns also have wind and percussion bands that play during the Lent and Easter-week processions, as well as on other occasions. The Garifuna people of Afro-Caribbean descent, who are spread thinly on the northeastern Caribbean coast, have their own distinct varieties of popular and folk music. Cumbia, from the Colombian variety, is also very popular, especially among the lower classes.\n\nThe Guatemala National Prize in Literature is a one-time only award that recognizes an individual writer's body of work. It has been given annually since 1988 by the Ministry of Culture and Sports.\n\nMiguel Ángel Asturias won the literature Nobel Prize in 1967. Among his famous books is \"El Señor Presidente\", a novel based on the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera.\n\nRigoberta Menchú, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting oppression of indigenous people in Guatemala, is famous for her books \"I, Rigoberta Menchú\" and \"Crossing Borders.\"\n\nHistorically, Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish and was the official religion during the colonial era. However, the practice of Protestantism has increased markedly in recent decades, with nearly one third of Guatemalans identifying themselves as Protestants, chiefly Evangelicals and Pentecostals. Growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Mayan population, with National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala being an important denomination, maintaining 11 indigenous-language Presbyteries.\n\nTraditional Mayan religion persists through the process of inculturation, whereby certain practices are incorporated into Catholic ceremonies and worship when they are sympathetic to the meaning of Catholic belief. Indigenous religious practices are increasing as a result of the cultural protections established under the peace accords. The government has instituted a policy of providing altars at every Mayan ruin found in the country, so traditional ceremonies may be performed there.\n\n"}

{"id": "840174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=840174", "title": "Jerry Mouse", "text": "Jerry Mouse\n\nJerry Mouse is a fictional character and one of the title characters (the other being Tom Cat) in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's series of \"Tom and Jerry\" theatrical cartoon short films. Created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Jerry is a brown anthropomorphic house mouse, who first appeared as a mouse named Jinx in the 1940 MGM animated short \"Puss Gets the Boot\". Hanna gave the mouse's original name as \"Jinx\", while Barbera claimed the mouse went unnamed in his first appearance.\n\nThe name \"Jerry\" was chosen by MGM animator John Carr, who submitted \"Tom and Jerry\" as potential names for the duo after an important Loews Inc. distributor in Texas asked for follow-ups to \"Puss Gets the Boot\". While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s, Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected hunter/prey relationship. Their Jerry Mouse, an \"incurable scene stealer\", served more or less as the protagonist of most of the films; instead of being a \"cowering victim\" of his pursuer, Tom, he took delight in besting, and often torturing, his antagonist (though sometimes, Tom is just following orders or is even just minding his own business and is antagonized by Jerry). Hanna and Barbera considered Tom and Jerry \"the best of enemies\", whose rivalry hid an unspoken amount of mutual respect.\n\nIn later \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, Jerry acquired a young ward: a small grey mouse called \"Tuffy\" or \"Nibbles\" depending upon the cartoon, who was left on Jerry's doorstep as a foundling baby in the 1946 short \"The Milky Waif\". Jerry and Tuffy were also featured together in a sub-series of \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons set in 17th century France which featured the characters as musketeers. The first of these shorts, \"The Two Mouseketeers\", won the 1951 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons.\n\nHanna and Barbera served as writer/directors of the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons until 1956, when they also became the producers. Fourteen \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons between 1940 and 1954 were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, with seven of the shorts winning that award. MGM shut down its animation department in 1957, but new \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were produced by Gene Deitch and later Chuck Jones during the 1960s. Jerry would also appear in later \"Tom and Jerry\" productions made for television, a series of direct-to-video features, and \"\", a 1992 theatrical film. Later productions eschewed much of the violence the 1940s and 1950s shorts were known for, and in several of the television shows Jerry was given a red bow tie and a kinder disposition.\n\nTom and Jerry aren't always enemies; they have been known to team up on occasion.\n\nOn his own, Jerry Mouse appears in a fantasy sequence in the 1945 Gene Kelly MGM musical film \"Anchors Aweigh\". Jerry appears as the ruler of a kingdom where music is banned because he feels he lacks talent, and Kelly persuades the mouse into performing a song-and-dance number with him. Kelly and MGM had originally wanted Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse as Kelly's dance partner for the sequence, but Disney was unwilling to license the character.\n\nHanna and Barbera achieved the effect of Kelly dancing with Jerry by rotoscoping: live-action plates of Kelly dancing alone were shot first, and the action traced frame by frame so that Jerry's movements would match. The success of the animated segment of \"Anchors Aweigh\", which was noted as \"stealing the show\" in contemporary trade reviews, led to two more live-action/animated projects for Hanna and Barbera and MGM: an underwater ballet sequence featuring both Tom and Jerry in Esther Williams' 1953 film \"Dangerous When Wet\", and the \"Sinbad the Sailor\" sequence of Kelly's 1956 film \"Invitation to the Dance\".\n\nIn 1990, this version of Jerry wears a red bowtie, and has a tuft of hair on his head. He often taunts Tom (as a kitten) any chance he gets. Sometimes, in a few episodes, he is friends with/allies of Tom.\n\n\nJerry has had a number of voice actors over the years. Ever since his debut in \"Puss Gets the Boot\" his vocal effects were provided by co-creator William Hanna during the Hanna-Barbera era. Sara Berner also did vocal effects for Jerry in the short \"Baby Puss\" (1943) and voiced him in the short \"The Zoot Cat\" (1944), as well as \"Anchors Aweigh\" (1945) in a dance sequence with him and Gene Kelly. Billy Bletcher provided some vocal effects for Jerry in the short \"Mouse in Manhattan\". A sequence in the short \"The Milky Waif\" (1946) features Jerry and Nibbles disguising themselves as a pair of black people, in which the former is voiced by Lillian Randolph (same voice as Mammy Two Shoes). Paul Frees did Jerry's speaking voice in the shorts \"His Mouse Friday\" (1951) and \"Blue Cat Blues\" (1956). When the MGM cartoon studio shut down in 1957, Gene Deitch and European animation studio Rembrandt Studio took over, and voice actor Allen Swift did Jerry's voice during the 1961-62. During the Chuck Jones era in 1963-1967, his voice was provided by Mel Blanc and June Foray. Stan Freberg did his voice in the short \"The Cat Above and the Mouse Below\" (1964) and Dale McKennon did Jerry’s singing voice in \"Cat and Dupli-cat\" (1967). In \"The Tom and Jerry Show\" (1975), Jerry was voiced by John Stephenson. Frank Welker voiced him in \"The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show\" (1980-1982), \"Tom and Jerry Kids\" (1990-1994), and \"\" (2002). Dana Hill voiced Jerry in \"\" (1992).\n\nOther voice actors include Samuel Vincent in \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" (2006-2008) and Charlie Adler in \"Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers\" video game (2002). In \"The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)\", Jerry's vocal effects are provided by archival recordings of William Hanna and Mel Blanc from the original theatrical shorts.\n\nTom and Jerry were planned to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\" from the 1988 film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". \n\n"}
{"id": "249119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249119", "title": "Joseph Franklin Rutherford", "text": "Joseph Franklin Rutherford\n\nJoseph Franklin Rutherford (November 8, 1869 – January 8, 1942), also known as Judge Rutherford, was the second president of the incorporated Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. He played a primary role in the organization and doctrinal development of Jehovah's Witnesses, which emerged from the Bible Student movement established by Charles Taze Russell.\n\nRutherford began a career in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of \"The Finished Mystery\", a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.\n\nRutherford introduced many organizational and doctrinal changes that helped shape the current beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses. He imposed a centralized administrative structure on the worldwide Bible Student movement, which he later called a theocracy, requiring all adherents to distribute literature via door to door preaching and to provide regular reports of their preaching activity. He also instituted training programs for public speaking as part of their weekly meetings for worship. He established 1914 as the date of Christ's invisible return, asserted that Christ died on a tree rather than a cross, formulated the current Witness concept of Armageddon as God's war on the wicked, and reinforced the belief that the start of Christ's millennial reign was imminent. He condemned the observance of traditional celebrations such as Christmas and birthdays, the saluting of national flags and the singing of national anthems. He introduced the name \"Jehovah's witnesses\" in 1931 and the term \"Kingdom Hall\" for houses of worship in 1935.\n\nHe wrote twenty-one books and was credited by the Society in 1942 with the distribution of almost 400 million books and booklets. Despite significant decreases during the 1920s, overall membership increased more than sixfold by the end of Rutherford's 25 years as president.\n\nRutherford was born on November 8, 1869 to James Calvin Rutherford and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a Baptist farm family. Some sources list his place of birth as Boonville, Missouri, but according to his death certificate he was born in Versailles, Missouri. Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to take his place on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.\n\nRutherford spent two years as a judge's intern, became an official court reporter at age 20, and was admitted to the Missouri bar in May 1892 at age 22. He became a trial lawyer for a law firm and later served for four years in Boonville as a public prosecutor. He campaigned briefly for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. He was appointed as a Special Judge in the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court of Missouri, sitting as a substitute judge at least once when a regular judge was unable to hold court. As a result of this appointment he became known by the sobriquet Judge Rutherford. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1909 and admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States the same year.\n\nIn 1894 Rutherford purchased the first three volumes of Charles Taze Russell's \"Millennial Dawn\" series of Bible study textbooks from two colporteurs who visited his office. Rutherford, who then viewed all religions as insincere, shallow and hypocritical, was struck by Russell's sincerity and his sentiments towards religion, which mirrored his own view. Rutherford immediately wrote to the Watch Tower Society to express appreciation for the books. He was baptized twelve years later and he and his wife began holding Bible classes in their home. In 1907, he became legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society at its Pittsburgh headquarters, and from around that time began to give public talks as a \"pilgrim\" representative of the Society. As Russell's health deteriorated, Rutherford represented him on trips to Europe and in April 1915 he was deputized to speak at a major debate with Baptist preacher J. H. Troy over four nights in Los Angeles before an audience of 12,000, debating various subjects, including the state of the dead, hellfire and Christ's Second Coming. Rutherford wrote a pamphlet, \"A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens\", in defense of Russell and served as chairman of the Bible Students' Los Angeles convention in September 1916.\n\nBy 1916 Rutherford had become one of the seven directors of the Watch Tower Society; when Russell died on October 31, 1916 he joined vice-President Alfred I. Ritchie and Secretary-Treasurer William E. Van Amburgh on a three-man executive committee that ran the Pennsylvania corporation until a new president was elected at the annual general meeting the following January. He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run \"The Watch Tower\" from the December 15, 1916 issue. Russell's will, drawn up in 1907, had named the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death; Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose.\n\nBible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, who served as an aide to the executive committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: \"A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held a large number of votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office.\" Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, \"Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nOn January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, was elected president of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the president would be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.\n\nBy June, four of the seven Watch Tower Society directors—Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright— had decided they had erred in endorsing Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic. In June, Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the board's authority from the president. Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society. The Watch Tower Society's official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted directors confirmed that given to Rutherford; however, the pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford's. On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned Rutherford to office.\n\nThe controversy fractured the Bible Student movement and some congregations split into opposing groups loyal either to Rutherford or those he had expelled. By mid-1919 about one in seven Bible Students had chosen to leave rather than accept Rutherford's leadership, and over the following decade they helped form or joined other groups including the Stand Fast Movement, the Layman's Home Missionary Movement, the Dawn Bible Students Association, the Pastoral Bible Institute, the Elijah Voice Movement, the Concordant Publishing Concern, and the Eagle Society.\n\nIn late 1916 Fisher and another prominent Bible Student at the Brooklyn headquarters, Clayton J. Woodworth, sought the Executive Committee's approval to produce a book about the prophecies of the books of Revelation and Ezekiel based primarily on Russell's writings. Work on the book, \"The Finished Mystery\", proceeded without the knowledge of the full Board of Directors and Editorial Committee and was released by Rutherford to headquarters staff on July 17, 1917, the day he announced the appointment of the four replacement directors.\n\nThe book, which was misleadingly labeled as the posthumous seventh volume of Russell's \"Studies in the Scriptures\", was denounced by Rutherford's opponents, but became a best-seller and was translated into six languages and serialized in \"The Watch Tower\". Expecting God's Kingdom to establish rule on earth and for the saints to be raised to heaven in 1918, Rutherford wrote in January of that year: \"The Christian looks for the year to bring the full consummation of the church's hopes.\" He embarked on a vast advertising campaign to expose the \"unrighteousness\" of religions and their alliances with \"beastly\" governments, expanding on claims in \"The Finished Mystery\" that patriotism was a delusion and murder. The campaign attracted the attention of governments and on February 12, 1918 the book was banned by the Canadian government for what a Winnipeg newspaper described as \"seditious and antiwar statements\" On February 24 in Los Angeles Rutherford gave a talk entitled \"The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living May Never Die\" (subsequent talks in the series were renamed, \"Millions Now Living \"Will\" Never Die\") in which he attacked the clergy, declaring: \"As a class, according to the Scriptures, the clergymen are the most reprehensible men on earth for the great war that is now afflicting mankind.\" Three days later the Army Intelligence Bureau seized the Society's Los Angeles offices and confiscated literature.\n\nIn early May 1918 US Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory condemned \"The Finished Mystery\" as \"one of the most dangerous examples of ... propaganda ... a work written in extremely religious language and distributed in enormous numbers\". Warrants were issued for the arrest of Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower directors, who were charged under the 1917 Espionage Act of attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty, refusal of duty in the armed forces and obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service of the U.S. while it was at war. On June 21 seven of them, including Rutherford, were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Rutherford feared his opponents would gain control of the Society in his absence, but on January 2, 1919 he learned he had been re-elected president at the Pittsburgh convention the day before, convincing him that God wanted him in the position. In March 1919 the directors were released on bail after an appeals court ruled they had been wrongly convicted; in May 1920 the government announced that all charges had been dropped.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Rutherford began a major reorganization of Bible Student activities. At a May, 1919 convention in Ohio he announced the publication of a new magazine, \"The Golden Age\" (later renamed \"Awake!\"). Because Russell's will had decreed the Society should publish no other periodicals the new magazine was at first published by \"Woodworth, Hudgings & Martin\", with a Manhattan (rather than Brooklyn) address. Within months Bible Students were organized to distribute it door-to-door. He expanded the Society's printing facilities, revived the colporteur work and in 1920 introduced the requirement for weekly reports of Bible Students' preaching activity. He expanded and reorganized overseas branch offices in what he regarded as a \"cleansing\" and \"sifting\" work.\n\nBeginning with an eight-day convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922 Rutherford, launched a series of major international conventions under the theme \"Advertise the King and Kingdom\", attracting crowds of up to 20,000. Audiences were urged to \"herald the message far and wide\". He stressed that the primary duty of all Bible Students was to become \"publicity agents\" in fulfillment of Matthew 24:14, especially in the form of door-to-door evangelism with the Society's publications. In 1928 Rutherford began to teach that the Cedar Point convention and the events resulting from it fulfilled the prophecy of the 1290 days at Daniel 12:11.\n\nIn 1920, Rutherford published a booklet, \"Millions Now Living Will Never Die\", and a year later published his first hardcover book, \"The Harp of God\". This was followed by a further nineteen hardcover books, each with one-word titles, such as \"Creation\" (1927), \"Jehovah\" (1934) and \"Children\" (1941). His publications reached a total printing of 36 million copies. In 1925 he gained full control over what doctrines would be taught in Watch Tower Society publications, overruling the refusal by the five-man Editorial Committee to publish his article, \"Birth of the Nation\", which contained significant doctrinal changes. Rutherford later claimed Satan had \"tried to prevent the publication of that article ... but failed in that effort\"; In 1927 the Watch Tower Society ceased printing of Russell's \"Studies in the Scriptures\". The Editorial Committee was dissolved in 1931, after which Rutherford wrote every leading article in \"The Watch Tower\" until his death. The 1933 Watch Tower Society \"Yearbook\" observed that the demise of the Editorial Committee indicated \"that the Lord himself is running his organization\".\n\nRutherford expanded his means of spreading the Watch Tower message in 1924 with the start of 15-minute radio broadcasts, initially from WBBR, based on Staten Island, and eventually via a network of as many as 480 radio stations. A 1931 talk was broadcast throughout North America, Australia and France, but his attacks on the clergy resulted in both the NBC and BBC radio networks banning his broadcasts.\n\nIn 1928 Rutherford began to abolish the system of electing elders by congregational voting, dismissing them as \"haughty\" and \"lazy\", and finally asserting in 1932 that electing elders was unscriptural. He impressed on elders the need to obey the Society's \"regulations\", \"instructions\" and \"directions\" without complaint. Service directors, who reported back to Brooklyn, were appointed in each congregation and a weekly \"service meeting\" introduced to meeting programs. In 1933 Rutherford claimed that abolishing elective elders was a fulfillment of the prophecy of 2300 days at Daniel 8:13–14, and that God's sanctuary (the Watch Tower Society) was thereby cleansed.\n\nAt a 1931 Bible Student assembly in Columbus, Ohio Rutherford proposed a new name for the organization, \"Jehovah's witnesses\", to differentiate them from the proliferation of other groups that followed Russell's teachings. Bible Students who opposed or abandoned Rutherford to form new groups were increasingly described as the \"evil servant class\" by \"The Watchtower\", which said it was wrong to pray for those who were \"unfaithful\". Four years later the term \"Kingdom Hall\" was introduced for the local meeting place of congregations.\n\nIn 1937, the door-to-door preaching program was extended to formally include \"back calls\" on interested people and Witnesses were urged to start one-hour Bible studies in the homes of householders. In the late 1930s, he advocated the use of \"sound cars\" and portable phonographs with which talks by Rutherford were played to passersby and householders.\n\nIn 1938 he introduced the term \"theocracy\" to describe the denomination's system of government, with \"Consolation\" explaining: \"The Theocracy is at present administered by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, of which Judge Rutherford is the president and general manager.\" \"Zone servants\" (now known as \"circuit overseers\") were appointed to supervise congregations. In a \"Watchtower\" article Rutherford declared the need for congregations to \"get in line\" with the changed structure.\n\nBy 1942, the year of his death, worldwide attendance at the annual Memorial of Christ's death was 140,450 though his restructuring of the Bible Student community coincided with a dramatic loss of followers during the 1920s and 1930s. Worldwide attendance of the annual Memorial of Christ's death fell from 90,434 in 1925 to 17,380 in 1928. Memorial attendance figures did not surpass 90,000 again until 1940. Author Tony Wills, who analyzed attendance and \"field worker\" statistics, suggests it was the \"more dedicated\" Bible Students who quit through the 1920s, to be replaced by newcomers in larger numbers, although Rutherford dismissed the loss of the original Bible Students as the Lord \"shaking out\" the unfaithful. In the \"1942 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses\", Rutherford wrote that the year's achievements \"would, on the face of it, show that the Theocratic witness work on earth is about done\".\n\nIn July 1917, Rutherford had \"The Finished Mystery\" published as a seventh volume of the \"Studies in the Scriptures\" series. The volume, though written by Fisher and Woodworth, was advertised as Russell's \"posthumous work\" and \"last legacy\" but contained several interpretations and viewpoints not espoused by Russell, including an urging of all Bible Students to cast judgment upon Christendom and its clergy, the adoption of new dates for the fulfillment of particular prophecies, a claim that salvation is tied to membership within the Watch Tower Society, as well as shunning and censuring any who reject the interpretations given in the volume or related articles in \"Zion's Watch Tower\" magazine.\n\nIn the February 1918 discourse \"Millions Now Living Will Never Die\" (printed in booklet form in May 1920) a revision of Russell's calculation of a \"Jubilee type\" was presented, changing it from 1875 to 1925, despite Russell's rejection of such a change a few months prior to his death. In October 1920 the Society published a new edition of Russell's 1881 \"Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices\". It included an appendix introducing many alterations or reinterpretations of Russell's original views on the death of Jesus and the role of Christ's followers in heaven as typified in the ceremonies of the Jewish tabernacle.\n\nAt the 1922 Cedar Point convention Rutherford began teaching that Christ's reign had begun in 1914, and not 1878 as Russell had taught. Rutherford expanded on this view in the March 1, 1925 issue of \"The Watch Tower\" in the article \"Birth of The Nation\", which he later acknowledged \"caused a real stir or shake-up within the ranks.\" In 1927 he moved the date of the resurrection of the \"sleeping saints\" (all Christians who had died since Jesus' time) from 1878 to 1918 and as early as 1930 began to dismiss the year 1874 as the date for the invisible presence of Christ in favor of the year 1914.\n\nFrom 1925 he developed the view of the battle of Armageddon as a universal war waged by God rather than Russell's belief that it was the decline of human society into social, political and religious anarchy. Rutherford based his interpretations on the books of Exodus, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Psalms as well as additional material from the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. An article in the January 1, 1926 \"Watch Tower\" introduced new emphasis on the importance of the name \"Jehovah\"; from 1929 Rutherford taught that the vindication of God's name—which would ultimately occur when millions of unbelievers were destroyed at Armageddon—was the primary doctrine of Christianity and more important than God's display of goodness or grace toward humankind. In 1932 he published an interpretation of a passage in Ezekiel describing the attack on Jerusalem by Gog of Magog, in which he predicted an intensification of persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses that would culminate in God intervening on their behalf to begin the battle of Armageddon, which would destroy all opposers of God's organization.\n\nIn 1926 he discredited Russell's teaching on the importance of Christian \"character development\" or personal \"sanctification\" and a year later discarded the teaching that Russell had been the \"faithful and wise servant\" of Matthew 24:45–47, warning that the desire to revere men was a snare set by the Devil. In May 1926 Rutherford released his book \"Deliverance\" at the Bible Student's convention in Kensington, England later interpreting the event as the fulfillment of the 1335 days of Daniel 12:12.\n\nIn 1927, Christmas was declared to be of pagan origin, and the following year its celebration by Bible Students was condemned as supporting \"Satan's organization\". Mother's Day was condemned in 1931, with other holidays as well as birthdays officially renounced in subsequent years.\n\nIn 1928 Rutherford discarded Russell's teaching that the natural Jews would be restored to Palestine and return to God's favor, despite having declared ten years earlier that prophecies of their restoration were already being fulfilled with the British takeover of Palestine from Turkey during World War I. He denied there was a role for Jews in God's Kingdom arrangement and by 1933 he had reversed Russell's earlier teaching, claiming that prominent Jewish business leaders were \"arrogant, self-important and extremely selfish,\" and would gain no favored standing with God. The teaching that God would restore the Jews to Palestine was discontinued around the same time.\n\nRussell's teaching that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built under God's direction was overturned in 1928, when Rutherford asserted that it had been built under the direction of Satan for the purpose of deceiving God's people in the last days. The announcement prompted further defections among long-time Bible Students.\n\nIn 1930, Rutherford published a systematic reinterpretation of the book of Revelation. Many of the symbols recorded in the book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928. These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views as well as the historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.\n\nAt a Washington, D.C. convention in 1935, Rutherford rejected Russell's teaching that the \"great company\" of Revelation 7:9 was a \"secondary spiritual class\" composed of millions of Christians who would be resurrected to heaven apart from the 144,000 \"elect\", and instead argued that the \"great multitude\", the \"sheep\" of Matthew 25 and the \"Jonadabs\" of 2 Kings chapter 10 all picture the people who could potentially survive Armageddon and receive everlasting human life on earth if they became Jehovah's Witnesses before it began.\n\nIn 1935, Rutherford objected to U.S. state laws requiring school students to salute the flag as a means of instilling patriotism; in the 1936 \"Yearbook\" he declared that baptized Jehovah's Witnesses who did salute the flag were breaking their covenant with God and were thus \"guilty of death\". In 1940, children in 43 states were expelled for refusing to salute the flag and the Watch Tower Society took most cases to court, with Rutherford personally leading the unsuccessful case of Minersville School District v. Gobitis. Controversy over the flag salute issue escalated and mob attacks became prevalent in many U.S. states until 1943 when the court overruled its previous decision in the case of West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. A U.S. law magazine noted how Jehovah's Witnesses had helped shape the course of constitutional law, remarking: \"Through almost constant litigation this organization had made possible an ever-increasing list of precedents concerning the application of the 14th amendment to freedom of speech and religion\".\n\nIn 1936, Rutherford rejected the belief that Jesus had been executed on a Roman cross, in favor of an upright stake or \"tree.\"\n\nBiographers describe Rutherford as tall and solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, and a strong booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, \"The New York Times\" stated that Rutherford \"has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker\". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford \"was warm and generous toward his associates but he was also a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense.\" Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, \"His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood.\" Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford \"spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that what he had to say was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death.\" Macmillan added, \"He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth.\" Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with \"a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil\", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a \"dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance.\"\n\nRutherford's confrontation with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness of his personality and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played \"hard-fisted church politics\" and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using \"The Watchtower\" as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At the heart of his opponents' complaints was his \"autocratic\" behavior as he strove to \"exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs.\" Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish \"The Finished Mystery\"—as high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, \"It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord.\" Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and \"did everything that he could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society's charter\".\n\nAccording to Wills, Rutherford emerged from prison in 1919 bitter against the world and the collusion he saw between the clergy and military that had secured his imprisonment. Soon after his release he coined the term \"Satan's organization\" to refer to this supposed conspiracy. In \"Watchtower\" articles Rutherford was similarly scathing towards big business, politics and the League of Nations. Rogerson describes Rutherford's attitude towards the clergy—his avowed enemies—as \"unadulterated hatred\". His attacks on clergymen, particularly those of the Catholic Church, from the late 1920s were strong enough to attract a ban on his broadcasts by the NBC radio network, which condemned his \"rabid attack upon organized religion and the clergy\". He also applied criticizing terms to those who had deserted Watch Tower ranks, calling them the \"evil servant\". He urged readers to view with contempt anyone who had \"openly rebelled against God's order or commandments\" and also described elective elders of the 1930s who refused to submit to Watch Tower Society administrative changes as \"despicable\".\n\nWills states that Rutherford seemed to relish his descriptions of how completely the wicked would be destroyed at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction. He claims that towards the close of his ministry Rutherford spent about half of each year's \"Watchtowers\" writing about Armageddon.\n\nAccording to Penton, Rutherford's austerity—evidenced by his distaste for Christmas, birthday parties and other popular customs that were described as of pagan origin or that encouraged creature worship and were not to be observed—led in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.\n\nRutherford's books and magazine articles reveal his strong views on \"the proper place of women\" in the church and society. In a 1931 book he linked the post-1919 rise of women's movements that encouraged equality of the sexes with satanic influence, and claimed the custom of men tipping their hats to women or standing when a woman approached was a scheme of the devil to turn men from God and indicated an effeminate streak in men who practiced the custom. Mother's Day was similarly described as part of a plan to turn people away from God. In 1938 he urged adherents to delay marriage and child-bearing until after Armageddon, which Wills claims prompted a strong community bias among Witnesses against marriage. Those who did marry, says Wills, were considered to be weak in faith. At a 1941 convention in Missouri he quoted Rudyard Kipling's description of women as \"a rag and a bone and a hank of hair\".\n\nFormer Jehovah's Witness and former Governing Body member Raymond Franz claimed there was no evidence Rutherford engaged in door-to-door ministry despite his assertion that it was a requirement and sacred duty of all Witnesses. Franz claimed to have heard Rutherford's associates say his responsibilities as president \"do not permit his engaging in this activity\". Macmillan, however, related details of Rutherford's home preaching in 1905 or 1906 when he was baptized, and a 1975 article quoted several Witnesses relating their experiences with Rutherford in the house-to-house ministry in the 1920s. The official history of Jehovah's Witnesses also notes, \"Rutherford personally shared with other conventioners as they engaged in the work of Kingdom proclamation from house to house.\" On August 2, 1928 in a meeting with the Bible Student elders who had attended a general convention in Detroit, Michigan Rutherford listed his responsibilities and concluded \"when I have attended to many other details, I have not had very much time to go from door to door.\"\n\nAuthors William Whalen and James Penton have claimed that Rutherford was to Russell what Brigham Young was to Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. Penton contends that both Russell and Smith were capable religious leaders but naive visionaries, while Rutherford and Young were \"hard-bitten pragmatists who gave a degree of permanency to the movements they dominated\".\n\nRutherford married Mary Malcolm Fetzer of Boonville, Missouri on December 31, 1891. Their only child, Malcolm Cleveland, was born on November 10, 1892. The couple separated after Joseph Rutherford became president of the Watch Tower Society. Mary remained an active member of the Jehovah's Witnesses until becoming confined to her home in the years before her death in 1962 at age 93.\n\nRutherford had reportedly lost the use of one lung from pneumonia suffered during his imprisonment in 1918 and 1919; finding New York's winter weather \"impossible\", Rutherford was encouraged by a doctor to \"spend as much time as possible\" in a more favorable climate. In 1929, a residence named \"Beth Sarim\" (literally, \"House of Princes\") was constructed at San Diego, California for Rutherford's use, initially as winter accommodation and later as a full-time residence. He died at the property in 1942. The villa was sold in 1948, with \"The Watchtower\" declaring, \"It had fully served its purpose and was now only serving as a monument quite expensive to keep.\"\n\nThe standard of Rutherford's accommodation and his personal conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society's former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of \"luxurious\" and \"expensive\" residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), as well as two Cadillacs and alleged that on more than one occasion he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and 'go from \"drink to drink\"'. In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle, legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing \"the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren.\" Moyle also accused Rutherford of \"unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language\" and condemned his allowing the \"glorification of alcohol\" at Bethel. Penton notes that Moyle was a \"teetotaller\" and \"puritanical\", but claims Rutherford's drinking habits were \"notorious\" and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation.\n\nFrom the age of 70, Rutherford underwent several medical treatments for cancer of the colon. This included an operation on November 5, 1941, which found \"carcinoma of the rectal sigmoid\". Doctors gave him less than six months to live. Rutherford died at Beth Sarim on January 8, 1942 at the age of 72. Cause of death was \"uraemia due to carcinoma of the rectum due to pelvic metastasis.\"\n\nA Watch Tower Society staff member said of the announcement of Rutherford's death, \"It was at noontime when the family was assembled for lunch. ... The announcement was brief. There were no speeches. No one took the day off to mourn. Rather, we went back to the factory and worked harder than ever.\"\n\nRutherford's burial was delayed for five months due to legal proceedings arising from his desire to be buried at Beth Sarim, which he had previously expressed to three close advisers from Brooklyn headquarters. According to \"Consolation\", \"Judge Rutherford looked for the early triumph of 'the King of the East', Christ Jesus, now leading the host of heaven, and he desired to be buried at dawn facing the rising sun, in an isolated part of the ground which would be administered by the princes, who should return from their graves.\" Based on his claims that resurrected biblical characters would live at Beth Sarim, Rutherford concluded that it was appropriate that his bones be buried on the property.\n\nThe legal problem arose because Beth Sarim was not a legally zoned cemetery. Witnesses collected more than 14,000 signatures for two petitions—one supporting his burial at Beth Sarim, another for a second preferred site on a nearby Watch Tower Society property named Beth-Shan—that Rutherford's dying wish might be granted. \"Consolation\" condemned San Diego County officials for their refusal to grant a permit for Rutherford's burial at either property, stating \"It was not the fate of the bones which they decided, but their own destiny. Nor is their blood on anyone else's head, because they were told three times that to fight against God, or to tamper with His servant's bones even, would bring upon them the condemnation of the Lord. ... So their responsibility is fixed, and they followed the course of Satan.\"\n\nSpeculation that Rutherford was secretly buried at Beth Sarim has been called \"private rumor\", 'frequently disproven', and \"myth\". The May 4, 1942 issue of \"Time\" magazine noted Rutherford's burial at Rossville, New York, on Staten Island; a private burial plot for Watch Tower branch volunteers is on Woodrow Road. In 2002, a caretaker at the immediately adjoining graveyard answered an inquiry about Watch Tower's graveyard by noting, \"I couldn't tell you who is buried on it because it has absolutely no markers or headstones\".\n\nRutherford was succeeded by Nathan Homer Knorr as president of the Watch Tower Society.\n\n\n"}

He is a medical doctor by profession, graduating from the University of Havana in 1953. Machado joined the revolutionary movement immediately following Fulgencio Batista's coup d'état of 10 March 1952, while still a medical student, and was an early member of the 26th of July Movement opposing the dictatorship. Later, under the command first of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and subsequently of Fidel Castro, he was one the original revolutionaries who fought the guerrilla war in the Sierra Maestra. In 1958, promoted to the rank of captain, he was sent to the province of Oriente under the command of Raúl Castro as part of the rebels' bid to open up a second front. There he was placed in charge of the guerrillas' medical service, establishing a network of hospitals and dispensaries, and was promoted to the rank of major \"comandante\" (top rank on Castro's rebel army).\n\nFollowing the revolutionaries' victory on 1 January 1959, he was appointed the director of medical services in Havana and later served as the national Minister of Health from 1960 to 1967, during which time he was responsible for the development of the country's health sector. In January 1968, reportedly in the aftermath of a personal conflict with Fidel Castro over the running of the health sector, he was appointed to serve as the Politburo's delegate in the province of Matanzas. He remained in Matanzas until mid-1971; his administration of the province's economy and health sector was successful, particularly in terms of crop outputs, public transport and reduced infant mortality.

He saw action in the campaigns in Naples, Sardinia, Rosellón and Catalonia, and in the siege of Gibraltar. Philip granted him the title of marquess of Castelfuerte on June 5, 1711. He was governor of Tarragona and captain general of Guipúzcoa. He was appointed a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1737 on his return to Spain, and was also awarded the Order of Santiago.\n\nIn 1723 Philip named him viceroy of Peru, a position which he took up in May of the following year. His term in office was distinguished by a campaign against fraud and corruption in the government, and reform of the royal treasury and tax collection. He took steps to strengthen the \"mita\", the forced labor of Indigenous in the silver mines, and thus to stimulate the production of the metal. He sent to jail the Count of San Juan de Lurigancho, director of the mint, as well as the assayer, for producing false coins. In order to fight smuggling (especially of silver), he reorganized the navy and fortified the coasts.\n\nHe reestablished the system whereby Inca nobles who could prove their ancestry were recognized as hijosdalgos of Castile. This led to a frenzy on the part of the Indigenous nobility to legitimate their status.\n\nIn 1724 society in Lima discovered an exotic drink — coffee. One patron commented, \"The new drink is as bitter as the new viceroy\".\n\nDuring this time the Comunero Revolt broke out in Paraguay. The governor of Paraguay, Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda, was an unpopular supporter of the Jesuits. A predecessor of Viceroy Armendáriz, Carmine Nicolao Caracciolo, sent an inspector there in 1721 to look into the matter. The inspector was José de Antequera y Castro. Antequera, however, gained the support of the comuneros, challenged royal authority, imprisoned Reyes Balmaceda and expelled the Jesuits. (The Jesuits were unpopular because they sheltered many Indians from forced labor.) Antequera defeated a royalist force from Buenos Aires under García Ros.\n\nIn 1724, Armendáriz, now the viceroy in Lima, ordered Buenos Aires governor Bruno Mauricio de Zabala to suppress the rebellion and send Antequera to Lima for trial. Antequera's followers deserted him, and he was forced to flee to a convent in Cordóba in March 1725. He was arrested at Chuquisaca in Charcas, and taken to Lima. He was eventually brought to trial, and in 1731 he was beheaded. However another revolt broke out in Paraguay in 1730, under Fernando Mompó de Zayas. Mompó asserted the sovereignty of the people over the king.\n\nArmendáriz faced other rebellions as well. The first uprising of the Chiriguanos, led by Aruma, occurred in 1727. In 1730 there was an insurrection in Oropesa, led by the Mestizo Alejo Calatayud.\n\nIn 1736 Armendáriz turned over the office to his successor, José Antonio de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Villagarcía. The ex-viceroy returned to Spain, became captain of the king's guard, and was elected a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1737. He died in 1740 without descendants.\n\n"}

The next day, the Captain thinks that he is going insane when he sees the women's dead bodies. He wrecks a tavern and gets into a fight with Le Bosco. The Captain, Tina, Le Bosco and Paul go back to the wreck to kill the women, who manage to escape. Wandering around, the women come across a clown who looks after them. The women are unable to speak, but a man tells them he can help them. They communicate via a drawing and the man realises that they want revenge. The women are the only ones who can free the devil from being imprisoned in the ruins of an old castle; by making love to each of them, he will give them the power to get their revenge. The women, now the \"démoniaques\", return for their revenge. At the beach, they are again attacked by the Captain and Le Bosco, who tie them to the wreck. The Captain goes mad and kills Tina and Le Bosco. He realises that what he has done is wrong, but is unable to save them, and the tide comes in and they all drown.\n\n\n\"Les Démoniaques\" was released on DVD in the US on 21 September 1999 by Image Entertainment, with an aspect ratio of 1.64:1.\n\nIt was released in the UK on 27 September 2004 by Redemption Films with an aspect ratio of 1.64:1 and special features including the theatrical trailer, a stills gallery and a Rollin filmography.\n\nIt was released in Europe on 30 August 2005 by Encore as part of a three-disc set with a new aspect ratio of 1.78:1 and special features including selected scenes with commentary (in English), an interview with Braque, the short film \"Les Pays Loins\", deleted scenes and a slide show.\n\n\n"}

His father was a Polish Jew and his mother was a black Bermudan.\n\nHe earned a B.S. degree in Conservation and Resource Studies in 1984, and then an M.S. and a Ph.D. in 1993, all from the University of California, Berkeley. His masters' and doctoral research were about economic and racial inequality in the geographical distribution of air pollution.\n\nAfter graduating, Gelobter worked for the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by John Dingell, and then served in the government of the City of New York under Mayor David Dinkins as Director of Environmental Quality. He then became founding Director of the Environmental Policy Program at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, where he was appointed an assistant professor. Next, he became a professor in the public administration department at Rutgers University.\n\nIn 2001 he moved back to California and became executive director of an environmental think tank called Redefining Progress. As part of that organization he advocated for California to adopt strong regulation of greenhouse gases through market mechanisms, which contributed to the passing of the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.\n\nIn 2007 he founded Cooler, a social venture that originally intended to launch a carbon offset credit card, and then offered two services – one to consumers to provide carbon offsets for goods they bought online, and the other partnering with online retailers to help them source carbon neutral goods to sell, using a model to calculate the carbon footprint of the goods. He then joined Hara, a Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers-backed company that developed and sold environmental management systems, as its Chief Green Officer, and then co-founded BuildingEnergy.com, a cloud-based building energy management business.\n\nAfter that, he started to work with the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to develop prize-based methods to find solutions to address global warming in the developing world, and joined Infoedge, a management consulting firm, where he directed their energy practice. He is a member of the board of trustees of Ceres. He served on the board of trustees of the Natural Resources Defense Council, and was a member of the advisory board of Al Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection. He has been a guest speaker at Singularity University, and spoke at the 2016 The Lean Startup Conference. He also lectures at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nGelobter has urged others to start businesses in the clean technology sector, in order to create, develop, and validate successful business models. He argues that clean technology companies survive by providing services to companies in the rest of the economy, and if a clean technology company is making money, it does so by helping other kinds of companies make more money as well – in other words, it uses sound environmental practices that are also economically sound and sustainable.\n\nGelobter and eight other authors with an environmental justice perspective responded to the 2005 essay, \"The Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming Politics in a Post-Environmental World,\" by Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus – which asserted that the environmental movement is unable to fully address climate change – with the essay, \"The Soul of Environmentalism: Rediscovering transformational politics in the 21st century\". They argued that Shellenberger and Nordhaus had not addressed the concerns of the non-white poor, and that the environmental movement could be strengthened by allying with social justice and civil rights movements.\n\n\n"}

In 1997, Kimball was employed as a special consultant by Halifax-based film production company Salter Street Films. He then served as the Program Administrator for the Nova Scotia Film Development Corporation until May 1999, after which he founded the Halifax-based film and television production company Redstar Films Limited. Kimball has served as the President of the Nova Scotia Film and Television Producers Association, a member of the Nova Scotia Film Advisory Committee, and was a founding member of the Motion Picture Industry Association of Nova Scotia. He has also worked as a consultant on the film and television industry to the governments of Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nAs a film and television producer / writer / director since 1999, Kimball has created over a dozen documentaries on a wide range of subjects for myriad networks, including Space, Bravo, Vision TV, CBC, TVNZ, SCN, Knowledge Network, EastLink TV, UFO TV, and TrueVisions. These include paranormal-themed films such as \"Stanton T. Friedman is Real\" (2002), \"Fields of Fear\" (2006), and \"Best Evidence: Top 10 UFO Sightings\" (2007). In 2008-09, he wrote, directed, produced and hosted the television series \"Ghost Cases\" in Canada for EastLink TV. He also wrote, produced and directed two seasons of the television series \"The Classical Now\" (2003–2005), the classical music documentary \"Denise Djokic: Seven Days Seven Nights\" (2003) which featured renowned Canadian cellist Denise Djokic, and the performance film \"Synchronicity\" (2008), all for Bravo (Canada).

His first book, \"The Other Side of Truth: The Paranormal, The Art of the Imagination, and The Human Condition\", was published in October 2012, by Redstar Books. Kimball is the nephew of prominent ufologist Stanton Friedman, but is skeptical of extraterrestrial visitation as an explanation for the UFO phenomenon, and is a vocal critic of the Exopolitics movement, a stance which has generated controversy among believers in the Extraterrestrial hypothesis.\n\nKimball posits that the paranormal could be our interaction with an advanced non-human intelligence who may be pulling things out of our own minds and presenting it back to us in ways that we will understand. This accounts for why tales of the paranormal have changed over various eras, from dragons to spaceships. Whoever is presenting these images is trying to appeal to a particular audience in a specific time frame. He theorizes that most paranormal phenomena is a kind of artistic creation by this non-human intelligence. It may be part of a teaching or preparation process, whereby humans are encouraged to move up to the next level of development or think about things in a broader way. He has drawn links between the paranormal and various strands of spiritualism and mysticism, including the experiences of Jakob Böhme, William Blake and Henry Alline.\n\nKimball also hosts a podcast called \"The Other Side of Truth\", where he has interviewed a wide range of people primarily about paranormal-themed subjects, including UFO researchers Kevin Randle, Nick Pope, and Stanton Friedman, historian and author Aaron John Gulyas, filmmaker Paul Davids, and scientist and consciousness researcher Dean Radin.

Farrow was dedicated to practicing the TM technique so she could become a TM teacher. She said: \"I would always rush straight back to my room after lectures and meals so I could meditate. John, George and Paul would all want to sit around jamming and having a good time and I'd be flying into my room. They were all serious about what they were doing, but they just weren't as fanatical as me\". She \"turned into a near recluse\" and \"rarely came out\" of her cottage.

From an early period, Mondavi aggressively promoted labeling wines varietally rather than generically. This is now the standard for New World wines. The Robert Mondavi Institute (RMI) for Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis opened in October 2008 in his honor.\n\nRobert Mondavi's parents Cesare Mondavi and Rosa Grassi emigrated from Sassoferrato in the Marche region of Italy and settled in the American city of Hibbing, Minnesota. Robert Gerald Mondavi was born in Virginia, Minnesota. From Minnesota the Mondavi family moved to Lodi, California, where he attended Lodi High School. In Lodi, his father, Cesare, established a successful fruit packing business under the name C. Mondavi and Sons, packing and shipping grapes to the east coast primarily for home winemaking. Mondavi graduated from Stanford University in 1937 with a degree in economics and business administration. While at Stanford he was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.\n\nIn 1943, Mondavi joined his father and brother Peter after the family acquired the Charles Krug Winery located in St. Helena, California from James Moffitt.\nIn 1965, Robert Mondavi left the family winery after a feud with his younger brother Peter over the business direction of the Krug Winery. Subsequently, Mondavi started his own winery in Oakville, California, and set out to create wines that could compete with fine French wines\n\nIn 1966, he founded the Robert Mondavi Winery with his sons Michael and Tim Mondavi in the Napa Valley with the goal of producing wines that would compete with the finest wines from Europe. Michael Mondavi, the eldest, was in charge of the sales and marketing for Robert, while Tim was the winemaker. Robert Mondavi was the first major winery built in Napa Valley in the post-Prohibition era. Part of Mondavi's original vineyard land included the \"To Kalon\" (a Greek term meaning \"the beautiful\") vineyard originally established by Napa Valley pioneer H.W. Crabb in 1868. The winery bearing Mondavi's name produced high quality wine in the California mission style.\n\nIn 1937, Mondavi married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie Ellen (Declusin) Mondavi. Together, the couple had three children, Michael, Marcia, and Tim. In the late 1970s their marriage ended in a divorce. In 1980, at the age of 67, he married Margrit (Kellenberger) Biever Mondavi, a Swiss-born, and multilingual woman who worked at the Robert Mondavi winery. Robert and Margrit had no children, but together they dedicated a lot of time and money to philanthropic events.\n\nIn 1968, Mondavi made a dry oak–aged Sauvignon blanc, an unpopular variety in California at the time, and labeled it \"Fumé Blanc\". The wine was a success and, in time, Fumé Blanc became accepted as a synonym for Sauvignon blanc.\n\nMondavi successfully developed a number of premium wines that earned the respect of connoisseurs and vintners alike. In 1979, he built the Mondavi Woodbridge Winery in Lodi, California developing it into a leader of popular-premium wines. He also entered into a joint venture with Baron Philippe de Rothschild of Château Mouton Rothschild to create Opus One Winery, and since the 1990s has set up joint ventures with local partners in Europe, South America and Australia.\n\nInterested by his work and his success, in the 1990s Mondavi's story and his wine company became topics for specialists of wine. \n\nIn the Grand European Jury Wine Tasting of 1997, the Robert Mondavi Chardonnay Reserve was ranked number one.\n\nIn 2005, Robert Mondavi and his younger brother Peter made wine together for the first time after their feud. Using grapes from both family vineyards, they produced one barrel of cabernet blend, which was sold for $400,000 under the name \"Ancora Una Volta\" (\"Once Again\") at the 2005 Napa Valley Auction. All the money earned from the barrel of wine went to charity.\n\nIn 2003, Mondavi expressed regret and criticized his sons for the business strategy that emphasized the inexpensive Mondavi lines, Coastal and Woodbridge, over the premium wines, allowing the company name to lose its association with fine wine it held in the past. He said, \"We've got to get our image back, and that's going to take time.\"\n\nIn the 2004 documentary film \"Mondovino\", the Mondavi family featured prominently, in close application to its theme of globalization. At the time, the Mondavis had recently acquired the Italian \"cult wine\" Ornellaia winery, Tenuta Dell'Ornellaia.\n\nOn December 22, 2004, Constellation Brands acquired the Mondavi winery in a controversial takeover for nearly US$1.36 billion in cash and assumption of debt. Following the sale of the company, Mondavi partnered with his younger son Tim Mondavi and daughter Marcia Mondavi to make a single wine from a single estate at the highest level. The family partnership Continuum Estate is still run by Robert's son Tim, daughter Marcia and grandchildren Carissa Mondavi, Chiara Mondavi, Carlo Mondavi and Dante Mondavi. \n\nIn 2001, Robert Mondavi donated $10 million to help with the building cost of the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts building at UC Davis. The Mondavi Center was opened on October 3, 2002. Robert also donated $25 million to establish the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science and this opened a new era for UC Davis’s wine and food programs. It was the largest private contribution to UC Davis.\n\nThe two were founders and major benefactors behind the museum Copia, which opened November 2001 in the city of Napa, California.\n\nRobert and Margrit were also founding supporters of the restoration of the 19th-century Napa Valley Opera House and the Oxbow School, a new art school in Napa that provides grants and instruction to art students in their junior year of high school. They have contributed to the restoration of the Lincoln Theatre in Yountville, California, and have supported the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\nRobert Mondavi died at his Yountville home on May 16, 2008 at the age of 94.\n\nAn autobiography \"Harvests of Joy\" was published in 1998.\nRobert Mondavi was selected as the \"Decanter\" \"Man of the Year\" in 1989. \nHe was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nIn 2000 he was awarded Doctor of Oenology, Honoris Causa, by the Board of Trustees of Johnson & Wales University.\n\nIn 2002, he received the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. In 2005, he received the Legion of Honour from the French government.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Mondavi into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts.\n\nHe was inducted into the Culinary Institute of America Vintner's Hall of Fame in 2007. The election was based upon ballots from seventy wine journalists. The decision for their election of Mondavi is for contributions to the wine industry of California during his lifetime.\n\nRobert Mondavi was awarded the Presidential Gold Medal of the Confrerie de la Chaine des Rotisseurs in December 2006 for his many contributions to the Society.\n\n\n"}

Her father, John Boyd, was the keeper of the Spruce Point Light near St. Stephen, New Brunswick. Roberta and her mother would tend the light when her father was away. \n\nOn 8 October 1882, Boyd saved two men whose sailing boat had overturned in the river, and rowed them back to shore.

{"id": "28156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28156", "title": "Salem al-Hazmi", "text": "Salem al-Hazmi\n\nSalem al-Hazmi (, , also transliterated as Alhazmi) (February 2, 1981 – September 11, 2001) was one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77 as part of the September 11 attacks.\n\nHazmi had a relatively long history with al-Qaeda before being selected for the attacks. He obtained a tourist visa through the Visa Express program and arrived in the United States in June 2001 where he would settle in New Jersey with other American 77 hijackers up until the attacks.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Hazmi boarded American Airlines Flight 77 and helped subdue the passengers and crew for Hani Hanjour, the pilot among the hijackers, to crash the plane into west facade of the Pentagon. His older brother, Nawaf al-Hazmi, was another hijacker aboard the same flight. At the age of 20 years and 221 days, he was the youngest hijacker who participated in the attacks.\n\nHazmi was born on February 2, 1981 to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer, in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. His father described Salem as a quarrelsome teenager who had problems with alcohol and petty theft. However, he stopped drinking and began to attend the mosque about three months before he left his family.\n\nThere are reports that he fought in Afghanistan with his brother, Nawaf al-Hazmi, and other reports say the two fought together in Chechnya. Salem al-Hazmi was an al-Qaeda veteran by the time he was selected for participation in the 9/11 attacks. U.S. intelligence learned of Hazmi's involvement with al-Qaeda as early as 1999, but he was not placed on any watchlists.\n\nKnown as \"Bilal\" during the preparations, both he and Ahmed al-Ghamdi flew to Beirut in November 2000, though on separate flights.\n\nAlong with Nawaf al-Hazmi and several other future hijackers, Salem al-Hazmi may have attended the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was there that the details of the 9/11 attacks were decided upon.\nAccording to the FBI and the 9/11 Commission report, Hazmi first entered the United States on June 29, 2001, although there are numerous unconfirmed reports that he was living in San Antonio, Texas with fellow hijacker Satam al-Suqami much earlier. Hazmi used the controversial Visa Express program to gain entry into the country.\n\nHazmi moved to Paterson, New Jersey where he lived with Hani Hanjour. Both were among the five hijackers who applied for Virginia identity cards at the Arlington office of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles on August 2, 2001, although Salem already held an NJ identity card.\n\nOn August 27, brothers Nawaf and Salem purchased flight tickets through Travelocity.com using Nawaf's visa card.\n\nWith the four other Flight 77 hijackers, he worked out at a Gold's Gym in Greenbelt, Maryland from September 2 to September 6 of the same year.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Hazmi boarded American Airlines Flight 77. Airport surveillance video from Washington's Dulles Airport shows two of the five hijackers, including Salem al-Hazmi, being pulled aside to undergo additional scrutiny after setting off metal detectors.\n\nThe flight was scheduled to depart at 08:10, but ended up departing 10 minutes late from Gate D26 at Dulles. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. At 08:54, Flight 77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south, and then hijackers set the flight's autopilot heading for Washington, D.C. Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of the Pentagon, killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers), along with 125 on the ground in the Pentagon. In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight 77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any DNA samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI. Forensics teams confirmed that it seemed two of the hijackers were brothers, based on their DNA similarities.\n\nShortly after the attacks, several sources reported that Salem al-Hazmi, 26, was alive and working at a petrochemical plant in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. He claimed that his passport had been stolen by a pickpocket in Cairo three years before, and that the pictures and details such as date of birth released to the public by the FBI were his own. He also stated that he had never visited the United States, but volunteered to fly to the U.S. to prove his innocence. On September 19, \"Al-Sharq Al-Awsat\" published his photograph alongside Badr Alhazmi's, who they claimed was the actual hijacker who had stolen his identity.\n\nMuhammad Salim al-Hazmi, father of the two suspects, Nawaf and Salim Muhammad al-Hazmi, said that the published photos may be doctored or faked somehow. Hazmi continued, \"As a father, I have a feeling that the two of them are still alive and unhurt, and will come back home in the near future when the truth is uncovered and the real culprits are found.\"\n\nAfter some confusion and doubt Saudi Arabia admitted that in fact the names of the hijackers were correct. \"The names that we got confirmed that,\" Interior Minister Prince Nayef said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"Their families have been notified.\" Nayef said the Saudi leadership was shocked to learn 15 of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and said it was natural that the kingdom had not noticed their involvement beforehand.\n\n"}
{"id": "5207682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5207682", "title": "Spencer Reid", "text": "Spencer Reid\n\nSpencer Reid is a fictional character from the CBS crime drama \"Criminal Minds\", portrayed by Matthew Gray Gubler. Reid is a genius with an IQ of 187 and can read 20,000 words per minute with an eidetic memory (meaning that he can remember an exceedingly large amount of information with extraordinary detail.) He is the youngest member of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), has three BAs and three PhDs, and specializes in statistics and geographic profiling.\n\nReid was born on October 12th, 1981 and is a genius and autodidact who graduated from a Las Vegas public high school at age 12. He has an IQ of 187, an eidetic memory, and can read 20,000 words per minute (an average American adult reads prose text at 200–300 words per minute). He holds B.A.s in Psychology, Sociology, and Philosophy, a Ph.D. in Chemistry and Engineering as well as a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Caltech.\n\nReid is 23 in the pilot episode, having joined the unit when he was 22. His fellow team members almost always introduce him as Dr. Reid. Hotch reveals in the first season that Gideon insists on introducing him as Dr. Reid because Gideon fears that, because of his age, Reid will not be taken seriously as an FBI agent. This was a genuine concern, both for in-universe and for audience acceptance, since in real life the minimum age to become an FBI Special Agent is 23, with at least three more years to obtain Supervisory Special Agent status, and appointments to the BAU do not usually occur until after at least eight to ten years in the FBI. While filming the pilot, the show's FBI consultant informed Matthew Gray Gubler that there was nothing realistic about his character.\n\nBefore Gubler was cast in the role, the character was envisioned as more like Data from \"Star Trek\". However, the producers liked Gubler's softer interpretation, despite telling the actor he was wrong for the part. After several callbacks, he was hired.\n\nDuring October 2012, series creator Jeff Davis tweeted that Reid was originally envisioned to be bisexual, but the network shut the idea down by the fourth episode when Reid develops a crush on his colleague, Jennifer \"JJ\" Jareau.\n\nAs a common characteristic of people with Asperger's syndrome, Reid is socially awkward. Reid has a hard time dealing with his emotions. He often fixates on things (prompting Morgan and other team members to have to tell him to be quiet), and misses social cues at times (for example, unknowingly changing the subject of a conversation). The Unknown Subject (\"UnSub\") in \"Broken Mirror\" notes this, and Gubler stated in an interview in the show's second season \"[Reid]'s an eccentric genius, with hints of schizophrenia and minor autism, Asperger's syndrome. Reid is 24 years old with three Ph.D.s and one cannot usually achieve that without some form of autism.\" Writer Sharon Lee Watson stated in a Twitter chat that Reid's Asperger traits make the character more lovable.\n\nGubler has commented on the differences between Reid and similarly odd character Penelope Garcia: \"She represents everything he's not, she's very tech oriented and I would like to imagine he is more like 1920s smart, books and reading etc\". Kirsten Vangsness agreed, adding that Garcia is more extroverted and available emotionally, whereas Reid struggles with his emotions. Reid is a technophobe, using neither email nor the new iPads. Gubler tweeted that Reid is also germaphobic. In general, Reid dislikes shaking hands, and shows adverse reactions when touched by strangers. It is speculated the character may also have slight obsessive compulsive disorder, particularly from a scene in \"Out of the Light\" where Derek Morgan slightly moves an item in the home of an UnSub afflicted with OCD, and Reid immediately places it back to its previous spot.\n\nReid is a good map-reader, and therefore does the geographic profiling and map-related activities for the team. He also has a talent with words, and is the team's go-to linguistic profiler, as well as their unofficial discourse analyst. He is rarely seen behind the wheel – one time when Morgan hands him the keys, JJ and Emily exchange horrified expressions – but in \"Lo-Fi\" he is seen getting into the driver's side of a vehicle and even driving that same vehicle in one scene, as well as driving to Gideon's cabin in \"In Name and Blood,\" and in \"Nelson's Sparrow.\" However, he is usually seen as a backseat passenger during car scenes, and he commutes to work using the Metro, and presumably the VRE.\n\nSpencer Walter Reid was born in Las Vegas to William Reid (Taylor Nichols), a lawyer, and Diana Reid (Jane Lynch), a former professor of 15th century literature. Diana also has paranoid schizophrenia, and went off her medication during her pregnancy. Reid and his mother have a very close relationship despite her condition.\n\nAt age four, Spencer was approached by a man, Gary Michaels, while playing chess at a local park. Although Spencer was unharmed, Diana insisted the family move because she believed her son was in danger. Shortly thereafter, Spencer's six-year-old neighbor, Riley Jenkins, was sexually abused and murdered. Diana told Lou Jenkins, Riley's father, about the park incident. Diana then followed Jenkins and witnessed him beat Michaels to death with a baseball bat, getting blood on her clothes in the process. In order to protect his wife, William burned Diana's clothes, which Spencer inadvertently witnessed. Jenkins avoided arrest because Michaels \"disappeared\", and as he had a criminal history as a sexual predator, the police didn't look very hard into the case. Years later, Reid starts having nightmares about the incident, initially leading him to believe his own father was Riley's killer. Rossi and Morgan help him investigate. After undergoing hypnosis to recover his memories, Reid mistakenly believes he saw his father burning Riley's clothes, not Diana's. He pursues his father as a suspect, even after it becomes clear that Michaels is the more likely perpetrator. Michaels' body is found, and DNA confirms his killer was Lou Jenkins, who is arrested. While Reid is interviewing Jenkins, demanding to know how his father was involved, his parents interrupt and confess to their son the whole story.\n\nAt ten years old, Reid's father abandoned the family. The Michaels incident had already started the rift, and as Diana's mental state continued to deteriorate due to her paranoid schizophrenia, William left, refusing to take Spencer with him. He moved ten miles away, and never contacted his son. Reid finds out his father's address from Lou Jenkins seventeen years later, as well as the fact that his father never changed jobs. William later states that the reason he never returned was because he was too ashamed, and felt too much time had passed for him to re-enter Reid's life, although he did keep electronic tabs on his son. When his father was leaving, young Spencer tried to convince him to stay by using a statistic that children of parents who remain together receive more education. This angered William: \"We're not statistics.\" Reid states that one way he gets back at his father is to collect more educational degrees.\n\nDue to his young age and genius IQ, Reid was a victim of severe bullying in high school. In \"Elephant's Memory\", he recounts one instance where he was stripped naked and tied to a goalpost in front of other students, remaining there for hours. In \"L.D.S.K.\", Hotchner is forced to kick Reid in order to allow him access to a gun in order to shoot a suspect. When Hotch says he is sorry if he hurt him, Reid points out that he was a child prodigy in a Las Vegas school and tells Hotch, \"you kick like a nine-year-old girl\". Reid's social standing as a child increased when he started winning games as the coach of his high school's basketball team, using statistics to break down the opposing teams' shooting strategies.\n\nAt age twelve, Reid graduated from high school. He attended Caltech, where he rode his bike to classes. He finished his undergraduate degree at sixteen, and received his first doctorate (in Mathematics) the following year. It has also been stated that he attended MIT, but episode writer Breen Frazier admitted the MIT line was a mistake, although it has not yet been corrected onscreen. Yale University was Reid's \"safety school\". Between the ages of 17 and 21, he completed two more doctorates (Chemistry and Engineering), and two more Bachelor's degrees (psychology and sociology).\n\nWhen Reid was eighteen, he realized his mother's condition had deteriorated to the point where she could no longer take care of herself and had her committed involuntarily to a psychiatric institution, Bennington Sanitarium. Diana still resides in the same institution, and Reid says that he sends her letters every day, in part because of the guilt he feels for not visiting her. He worries about the fact that his mother's illness can be passed on genetically; telling Morgan: \"I know what it's like to be afraid of your own mind\".\n\nCurrently, Reid resides in an apartment in the District of Columbia, possibly near the Van Ness-UDC Metro stop.\n\nReid joined the FBI at either the age 21 or 22, depending upon what age he entered the FBI Academy. While there was \"no psychological exam or test the FBI could put in front of him he could not ace inside of an hour\", he did struggle with the more physical aspects of training, and ultimately received waivers for those requirements. Even after a year in the field, Reid still struggles to pass his gun qualifications. He is often left behind during takedowns, has never given chase, and jokes that it's Morgan's job to kick down the doors. This does not bother the team, because while he has shown an ability to physically disarm unsubs, his true talent is psychologically disarming them, as well as his abilities to solve the cases behind the scenes.\n\nProfiling is the only profession Reid considered, and he was groomed specifically for the BAU. Upon graduation from the Academy, he was placed in the BAU at age 22, and given the title Supervisory Special Agent. His first case in the field was the Blue Ridge Strangler.\n\nGideon is Reid's closest confidante on the team during the first two seasons, and often serves as a mentor to Reid. Gideon's departure affects Reid deeply. He tries playing all possible chess moves in order to understand.\n\nReid is close to JJ, Morgan, and Emily Prentiss. JJ asks him to be godfather to her new born son Henry, and is the only one on the team who calls him \"Spence.\" It is implied in \"Plain Sight\" that Reid may have a slight crush on JJ, and Gideon even prods him to ask out JJ after giving him Washington Redskins football tickets for his birthday, but nothing comes from it, and they continue with their brother-sister relationship. However, Reid is very protective of her, and often blames himself if she is injured; even if there was nothing he could have done to prevent it. In \"Closing Time\", after she arrests an unsub, but gets hurt in the process, Spencer is seen counting her injuries as she sits in the ambulance and tells the paramedic that she should be going to get a CAT scan. Reid also shares a brotherly friendship with Derek Morgan. In season seven, he is comfortable enough to start a joke war with him, something that he probably would never do with anyone else, and he occasionally confides his secrets to Morgan. It is suggested in the episode \"Epilogue\" that Reid told Derek details about what Tobias Hankel did to him when he makes a remark about seeing the afterlife before Tobias saved him. Morgan looks surprised and says \"You never told me that.\" In the episode \"Elephant's Memory\", when approached by a fully armed Owen Savage, the unsub whom Reid identifies with, Reid gives Prentiss his gun and trusts her enough to back him up and not shoot at Owen as he tries talking Owen down. Although not shown, it is implied Reid and Prentiss spend time together outside of work heavily, along with riding the train home together when they return from cases. Prentiss is the only one who has beat Reid at poker, even correcting his statistic about her particular poker move. Reid and Prentiss are held hostage by a cult led by Benjamin Cyrus (portrayed by Luke Perry). Though he is not injured, Reid struggles with guilt over \"allowing\" Prentiss's beating at the hands of Cyrus in \"Minimal Loss\". Reid later becomes close to Alex Blake, whose forensic linguistics class he guest lectures in. Blake serves as a maternal figure within the BAU.\n\nReid contracts anthrax during an outbreak in Maryland, and is later shot in the leg protecting a doctor whose life is being threatened.\n\nDuring \"Corazon\", Reid begins to suffer from severe headaches and hallucinations. He goes to see a doctor in order to find out the source of his headaches, but the doctor says there is no physical cause for his headaches, and they may be psychosomatic. Reid refuses to believe this, afraid that he may be suffering from the same illness as his mother. It is not mentioned again until \"Coda\", when he is seen once again wearing sunglasses and is carrying a book on migraines. In the same episode, Reid bonds with a young autistic boy, Sammy Sparks. A cut line from the episode has Rossi stating that Sammy and Reid are two of the most fascinating minds he's ever encountered. In the episode \"Valhalla\", Reid tells Prentiss about his headaches. By then, Reid has gone to several doctors, but no one has been able to diagnose what is wrong with him. He tells Prentiss that he has not told any of the team members because he is afraid that they will \"make him feel like a baby.\"\n\nIn \"Lauren\", it is Reid and Garcia who react most strongly to the news of Emily's death. Reid's reaction is to run out of the room, and he ends up sobbing into JJ's shoulder telling her that he \"never got a chance to say goodbye.\" In season seven, when Emily returns and Reid discovers Hotch and JJ faked her death, he is upset, especially with JJ. He tells her he feels betrayed because he came to her house \"for 10 weeks in a row, crying over losing a friend\" and \"not once did you have the decency to tell me the truth.\" She doesn't say anything. He asks J.J. \"what if\" he had started using Dilaudid again after Emily \"died.\"\n\nIn \"True Genius\", Reid doubts his reasons for being in the BAU and wonders if he should be doing more with his 'genius'. This is caused by the unsub sending him taunting messages and challenging Reid to find him. In this episode, he also reveals that the team missed his 30th birthday. At the end of the episode, the team throw him a mini birthday party.\n\nAfter being kidnapped by a serial killer with multiple personalities, Tobias Hankel (James Van Der Beek), Reid is tortured and drugged over the course of two days in \"Revelations\". This leads him to develop an addiction to the narcotic painkiller Dilaudid. While the BAU team members have their suspicions about Spencer's addiction, none of them confront him about it. An old friend of Reid's in New Orleans is also aware that Reid suffers from 'problems' in \"Jones\".\n\nReid gets clean and attends a support group meeting for addicts in law enforcement in \"Elephant's Memory\", at which he admits struggling with cravings as well as with traumatic memories, including a young adult suspect's shooting death in his presence. When he contracts anthrax in \"Amplification\", he strictly refused to take any narcotic painkillers in an attempt to remain clean. Memories of his torture under Hankel later allow him to empathize with other victims.\n\nThroughout the show, Reid shows a lack of interest when interacting with women. The only three exceptions are Lila Archer, a young actress he is assigned to protect; Austin (Courtney Ford), a bartender he \"woos\" with magic tricks while showing her a sketch of a potential suspect; and Maeve, a geneticist he first meets through correspondence, then later weekly phone calls. In \"Memoriam\", a prostitute hits on Reid in a Las Vegas casino, but he is oblivious to her intentions.\n\nIn \"Somebody's Watching\", with the team on a case to protect a TV starlet, Reid saves Lila Archer (Amber Heard) from being harmed by a serial killer. Reid and Lila kindle a short-lived romance, beginning when Lila pulls Reid, fully clothed, into her pool for a kiss. At the end of the episode, they go their separate ways, and Lila is not seen in further episodes.\n\nIn another episode, Reid and Morgan are in a nightclub trying to find a serial murderer who picks up women in nightclubs. Reid is having trouble talking to the women in these clubs, especially since he is spouting facts about club-related deaths, but Morgan helps him out. Reid starts a conversation with the female bartender, and proceeds to do a magic trick in which he appears to jab a pen through the eye of a police sketch, but pulls it through, leaving the paper unscathed. She expresses interest in him, and he gives her his business card in case she hears something about the killer. Later, she sees the killer with another potential victim and intentionally spills her drink on the lady, pulling her away. The killer seems to disappear, and while the bartender goes outside to phone Reid, he grabs her. The team responds quickly and saves her before she is harmed. At the end of the episode, she and Reid are talking over the phone, and he opens a package at his desk that contains the card that he gave her—with a lipstick kiss on the back.\n\nIn \"God Complex\", Reid begins calling a mystery woman on a pay phone and they talk about his progress with his headaches and sleep deprivation. It is revealed that she is in danger and doesn't want someone to know about her and Reid. While on a case in New Mexico, Alex Blake drops Reid off at a phone booth, unaware that he is going to call the mystery woman. Blake later returns and questions his motives. The two agents have a heated discussion, and he tells her the mystery woman is a geneticist he contacted about his headaches during season six, whom he believes can help on the case. Thanks to her, they are able to find the unsub and save his latest victim. At the end of the episode, Reid thanks her for her help and tells her that he and the BAU can help her in her situation. However, she refuses because she doesn't want \"him\" to hurt Reid. She ends the phone call by telling him that she loves him. Left shocked and speechless, he starts walking to his left but then turns around and walks to his right. Sometime after \"The Lesson\", Reid continues calling his mystery woman, and it is revealed that her name is Maeve (portrayed by Beth Riesgraf). She tells Reid that her stalker might be gone and because of this, she wants to meet him. During a case in Arizona, Blake confronts him about \"phone booth girl\". Reid tells Blake that he's nervous to meet her because he already believes she's the most beautiful girl in the world, and he is afraid that she won't like him because of his looks. Blake encourages him to meet her. After Reid gets back from the case, they plan to meet at a fancy restaurant until Reid sees a man gazing over at him. Thinking him to be Maeve's stalker, Reid calls her to cancel while she is right outside. Spencer realizes that the man is not the stalker, and Maeve has already left. The hostess gives him a bag that she left for him. It turns out to be the very same book he was going to give to her by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Inside, she has written a quote by Thomas Merton; \"Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone. We find it with another.\"\n\nIn \"Zugzwang\", Reid discovers that Maeve has been kidnapped by her stalker. In the investigation, he meets Maeve's former fiance, the man he believed to be her stalker. Reid becomes more and more distressed by the situation and discovers that her kidnapper is not her ex-fiance, but the man's girlfriend. Reid searches excessively to find her, and even offers to take her place. He discovers that the stalker wants attention from him and to be seen as an equal. He gets a clue from the stalker leading him to her location, where he tricks the unsub into believing that he is in love with her. Reid finally meets Maeve face-to-face during the situation and is able to briefly subdue the stalker, only to have her hold Maeve at gunpoint. He once again offers to take Maeve's place, but the unsub kills herself and Maeve in one shot.\n\nReid spends two weeks alone in his apartment after Maeve's death. The team constantly tries to help him, but he refuses to answer the door. While Reid remains at home, the team travel to another case. They call him for help a few times before he joins the team in person. Once the case is complete, Reid asks Morgan, Penelope, and JJ to help clean up his apartment. He picks up \"The Narrative of John Smith\" (given to him by Maeve) with the Thomas Merton quote and places it on the bookshelf.\n\nIn the months following, Reid throws himself into his work when he is not able to sleep because of a recurring dream where Maeve asks him to dance with her, but forces himself to wake up before he answers. By the end of \"Alchemy\", Reid is able to complete the dream by accepting Maeve's request to dance with her. In \"The Inspiration\", Reid admits that, had Maeve not died, he might have had kids. In the season nine finale, it is revealed that he still carries a copy of \"The Narrative of John Smith\" in his bag.\n\n"}

According to a congressional report of that incident, the roommate had previously been harassed by a \"person claiming to be a congressman on the House Internal Security committee\" who had insinuated knowledge of an \"undisclosed purpose\" behind the roommate and Beren's relocation from New York; the purported congressman claimed the move was done at the behest of the SWP for purposes of infiltration and agitprop.\n\nBeren left the SWP in 1990 due to, what he described as, \"exhaustion with it.\" \n\nAfter leaving the SWP, Beren became a member of the Democratic Party, where he remained for the next fourteen years.\n\nBeren quit the Democratic Party to become a Republican. He is a self-identified \"Tea Party activist\" and was an early confederate of Tea Party founder Keli Carender. The success of Carender's first event, a 2009 rally in Seattle against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, has been partly attributed to promotion it received on Beren's blog. Beren went on to organize and speak at other Tea Party rallies.\n\nBeren has said that Republicans should \"have bold colors, wave the Republican flag boldly; wave fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, immigration conservatism — boldly.\" During the 2012 GOP presidential primaries, Beren endorsed Newt Gingrich. He has called for fortifying the U.S.' southern border with Mexico and was a supporter of the 2003 Iraq War.\n\nIn 2006, and again in 2008, Beren ran for U.S. House of Representatives from Washington's 7th congressional district, advancing to the general election on the Republican ticket in the heavily Democratic-leaning district. In both races he was soundly defeated by incumbent Jim McDermott, scoring roughly 16-percent of the vote each time while being thoroughly outspent by his rival (McDermott spent $1 million during the 2008 election, compared to $32,850 invested by Beren's campaign). In 2010 he again ran for congress from Washington's 7th congressional district, that time as a declared write-in candidate.\n\nAs of 2014, Beren is the New Media and Technology Director for the Washington State Republican Party.\n\nBeren has lived in Seattle since 1987, and is married.\n\nBeren was very active in the Strat-o-Matic Baseball community in the late 1990s and 2000s. He was a member of the Great American Baseball League from 1998 to 2007, compiling a 664-956 (.410) record.\n\n"}

{"id": "2184302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2184302", "title": "Xavier Naidoo", "text": "Xavier Naidoo\n\nXavier Kurt Naidoo (born October 2, 1971), also known by his stage name Kobra, is a German Soul and R&B singer/songwriter, record producer, and occasional actor. He is a founding member of the German band Söhne Mannheims, and started two record labels, Beats Around the Bush and Naidoo Records. Naidoo also has a successful solo career. His debut album \"Nicht von dieser Welt\" (1998) has sold over 1 million records, and all his next six albums \"Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn\" (2002), \"Telegramm für X\" (2005), \"Alles kann besser werden\" (2009), \"Danke für's Zuhören\" (2012), \"Bei meiner Seele\" (2013) und \"Nicht von dieser Welt 2\" (2016) reached number 1 on the German album charts. Most of his songs are in German, however, he has also released a couple of English songs.\n\nBorn and raised in Mannheim to South African parents of Indian, German and Irish descent, Naidoo worked in several jobs in the food and music industries before relocating to the United States in the early 1990s, where he released his first full-length English-language album \"Seeing Is Believing\" under his stage name Kobra in 1994. He currently resides in Heidelberg in his native Germany.\n\nAfter working as a backing vocalist for the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt and 3P label mates Sabrina Setlur and Illmat!c, Naidoo released his first German language album \"Nicht von dieser Welt\" in 1998, for which he won an ECHO Award and an MTV Europe Music Award. Selling more than one million copies in total, it produced six singles, including \"Seine Straßen\" and \"Sie sieht mich nicht\", the latter of which served as the theme song for \"Astérix & Obélix Take on Caesar\" (1999). After his highly publicized departure from 3P, his third studio album \"Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn\" was released in 2002. It spawned the top five hit singles \"Wo willst du hin?\" and \"Abschied nehmen\" and led to a collaboration with Wu-Tang Clan member and producer RZA, with whom he released his first number-one single \"Ich kenne nichts (das so schön ist wie du)\" in 2003.\n\nKnown for his soulful voice and his Christian lyrics, he has collaborated with several famous artists such as Deborah Cox and Swiss artist Stress. Naidoo was with Söhne Mannheims (Sons of Mannheim) earlier before he became famous, after his popularity increased he went back to the band and wanted to help them to become famous too, which worked. Nowadays he switches back and forth with doing some solo music or recording an album and going on tour with Söhne Mannheims. He joined groups like Brothers Keepers and the charity project (Signs of the Times) in the early 2013\n\nIn 2012, he also collaborated in Xavas, a duo formation with Kool Savas, a Turkish-German rapper in the album \"Gespaltene Persönlichkeit\". The two had already worked together on a number of other releases.\n\nIn 2013, Xavier released \"Eye Opener\" on the vocal collaboration album \"Features\" by Kris Menace.\n\nOn 19 November 2015, Naidoo was announced as the German representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. His entry was due to be chosen from six competing entries in a national final in February.\n\nHowever, his selection proved controversial. Naidoo's right wing political views, coupled with homophobic lyrics in his 2012 song (featuring Kool Savas) \"Wo sind sie jetzt\", led to calls for his selection to be reconsidered. Within a day, an online petition had gathered nearly 15,000 signatories. Claudia Roth, a vice-president of the Bundestag for the German Green Party, also criticised the decision, citing the poor timing, with right wing political causes gaining popularity in the wake of the migrant crisis. On 21 November, it was revealed by the German broadcaster, NDR, that Germany had withdrawn the singer's participation.\n\nXavier Naidoo has blamed the Rothschild family for Germany's 20th century history and has spoken at a meeting of the Reichsbürgerbewegung, the right-wing movement that seeks to restore Germany's pre-1918 borders, denies the legal existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and claims Germany is a country occupied by enemy, foreign forces.\n\nNaidoo gave similar opinions in a live interview on ARD Morgenmagazin, public service breakfast television.\n\nNaidoo's music has been claimed to feature a utopian, pan-theistic ideology through which he expressed his own political anxieties and stances. Although he explores Christian, Muslim, and Rastafarian modes of living, his work has been asserted to be strongly grounded in Old Testament narratives and apocalyptic sentiments. Applying these to situations faced specifically in a \" Black German \"? context, Naidoo has called for solutions not from the state, but from cross-cultural spiritual collectivities. For example, in the lyrics and video for \"Seine Strassen,\" the power of the state in terms of protection and surveillance is said to pale in comparison to higher spiritual powers.\n\nHowever his lyrics have also featured anti-Semitic slurs and homophobic sentiments. His 2012 song \"Wo sind\" implied that homosexuals were paedophiles.\n\nNaidoo didn't engage directly with his own mixed German and Asian identity in his music, but he was integral to the formation of an Afro-German presence in German popular culture. Specifically, his work with Glashaus can be said to have originated a distinctly Afro-German form of R&B, one which addressed the issues faced by Black Germans without invoking Black Germans specifically. Not only did Naidoo experiment with sounds from around the Black Diaspora, notably working with RZA, but was also a member of Brothers Keepers, an explicitly Afro-German and explicitly political collective. As lead singer in \"Adriano,\" one of Brothers Keepers's most iconic songs, he stands with the Afro-German collective, setting the tone for their message.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
