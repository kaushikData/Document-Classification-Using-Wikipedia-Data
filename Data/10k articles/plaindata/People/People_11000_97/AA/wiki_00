All the children were committed Christians who were given a good education, brought up in a poor household. Told he would never make the sports team after breaking his back in a quarry aged 11, Mileson took up running. He won the bronze medal in the 1967 English cross country junior championships – then immediately stopped: \"It was the happiest day of my life. I hated every minute of running, but I had something to prove.\"\n\nStarting out from school and working in the construction industry, after the then Durham-based Mileson was made redundant in 1982, he set up his first construction firm, before branching out into insurance. Although estimates of his wealth varied, he was said to have sold two companies for £17m and £48.6m, with the highest tabloid estimates at over £75 million, according to a profile in \"The Sun\".\"\n\nTowards the end of his tenure at Gretna, Mileson was reported to be heavily in debt, with his personal bank account reported to be overdrawn by almost half a million pounds. Mileson was posthumously declared bankrupt in February 2010, after a businessman who was owed £1.85 million by Mileson made an application to Carlisle County Court.\n\nMileson was a devotee of grass-roots football, and made donations to several football trusts, including Carlisle's United Trust, Dundee United's Arab Trust, Ayr United's Honest Men Trust, Dundee's Dee4life Trust and Berwick Rangers's Supporters Trust. Mileson was made an honorary vice president of the Stockport County Supporters' Trust for the support and guidance he provided during their takeover of the club.

Mileson took control of the club and invested heavily in the team, and they were promoted from the Scottish Third Division to the Scottish Premier League in three consecutive seasons. Gretna also reached the 2006 Scottish Cup Final as a Second Division club, only losing to Hearts in a penalty shoot-out.\n\nMileson had been in poor health in recent years resulting from his many years as a chain smoker, subsequently undergoing two stomach operations. He also suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. He was admitted to hospital once again on 12 February 2008, suffering from a brain infection. After this event, his financial support for Gretna was withdrawn, bankrupting the club and leaving Gretna without a football team to play at Raydale Park. A new club called Gretna 2008 was founded in its place.\n\nMileson was not universally popular with Scottish football. St Johnstone chairman Geoff Brown described Mileson's ownership of Gretna as an \"ego trip\", which had experienced a \"day of reckoning\" when the club went out of business.\n\nMileson was found unconscious on his land at his home in the village of Blackford, close to Gretna, on the morning of 3 November 2008. He was taken to the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle, where he died a few hours after arrival. A coroner ruled that the death was an accident, caused by Mileson suffering a heart attack and then falling into a garden pond.\n"}
{"id": "73157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73157", "title": "Bruno Bauer", "text": "Bruno Bauer\n\nBruno Bauer (; 6 September 180913 April 1882) was a German philosopher and historian. As a student of G. W. F. Hegel, Bauer was a radical Rationalist in philosophy, politics and Biblical criticism. Bauer investigated the sources of the New Testament and, beginning with Hegel's Hellenophile orientation, concluded that early Christianity owed more to ancient Greek philosophy (Stoicism) than to Judaism. Bruno Bauer is also known by his association and sharp break with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and by his later association with Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche. Starting in 1840, he began a series of works arguing that Jesus was a 2nd-century fusion of Jewish, Greek, and Roman theology.\n\nBauer was the son of a painter in a porcelain factory and his wife at Eisenberg in Saxe-Altenburg, and became one of the great scholars of the 19th century.\n\nBauer studied at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin from Spring 1828 to Spring 1832. He became associated with the so-called Right Hegelians under Philip Marheineke, who engaged Bauer years later to edit the second edition of Hegel's \"Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion 1818–1832\". This was to become one of Bauer's best-known works—a three-volume, critical edition.\n\nIn 1834 he began to teach in Berlin as a licentiate of theology, and in 1839 was transferred to the University of Bonn.\n\nIn 1838 he published his \"Kritische Darstellung der Religion des Alten Testaments\" (Critical Exhibition of the Religion of the Old Testament) in two volumes. This work showed Bauer was faithful to the Hegelian Rationalist theology that interpreted all miracles in Naturalistic terms.\n\nConsistent with his Hegelian Rationalism, Bauer continued in 1840 with, \"Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte des Johannes\" (Critique of the Evangelical History of John). In 1841 Bauer continued his Rationalist theme with, \"Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker\" (\"Critique of the Evangelical History of the Synoptics\").\n\nAt no time in his writing was Bauer ever an orthodox Christian. From his earliest days of academic scholarship under Hegel, Bauer maintained a firm criticism of Immanuel Kant and a firm fealty to both Hegel's dialectic and his Rationalist Theology.\n\nAccused of being a so-called \"Right Hegelian\" (cf. David Strauss, \"In Defense of My 'Life of Jesus' Against the Hegelians\", 1838), he was later accused of being a \"Left Hegelian\" because of his association, or rather his early leadership, of the Young Hegelians. Yet the labels of 'Left' and 'Right' were only placed on Bruno Bauer by others; never by himself. Bauer considered himself simply a Hegelian.\n\nFrom 1839 to 1841, Bauer was a teacher, mentor and close friend of Karl Marx, but in 1841 they came to a break. Marx, with Friedrich Engels, had formulated a socialist and communistic programme that Bruno Bauer firmly rejected. Marx and Engels in turn expressed their break with Bauer in two books: \"The Holy Family\" (1845) and \"The German Ideology\" (1846).\n\nThe Prussian Minister of Education, Altenstein, sent Bauer to the University of Bonn, to protect his Rationalist Theology from the critique of the Berlin orthodox, as well as to win over Bonn University to Hegelianism. Bauer, however, created many enemies at pietist-dominated Bonn university, where he openly taught Rationalism in his new position as professor of theology. Bauer attested in letters during this time that he tried to provoke a scandal, to force the government either to give complete freedom of science and teaching to its university professors, or to openly express its anti-enlightenment position by removing him from his post.\n\nThe pro-Hegelian minister Altenstein had died and been replaced by the anti-Hegelian Eichhorn. The government officials asked for advice from the theology departments of its universities. Except for the Hegelian Marheineke, most said that a professor of Protestant theology should not be allowed to teach \"atheism\" to his student priests. As Bauer was unwilling to compromise his Rationalism, the Prussian government in 1842 revoked his teaching license. After the setbacks of the revolutions of 1848, Bauer left the city. He lived an ascetic and stoic life in the countryside of Rixdorf near Berlin.\n\nBauer continued to write, including more than nine theological tomes, in twelve lengthy volumes. His lengthy volumes varied between theology, modern history and politics. He published them at his own expense while working at his family's tobacco shop.\n\nBetween 1843 and 1845 Bauer published \"Geschichte der Politik, Kultur und Aufklärung des 18ten Jahrhunderts\" (\"History of Politics, Culture and Enlightenment in the 18th Century\", in 4 volumes). In 1847 Bauer published \"Geschichte der französischen Revolution\" (\"History of the French Revolution\", in 3 volumes).\n\nBetween 1850 and 1852 Bauer published \"Kritik der Evangelien und Geschichte ihres Ursprungs\" (\"A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin\"), as well as \"Kritik der paulinischen Briefe\" (\"Critique of the Pauline Epistles\"). In these works Bauer led the academic movement to subject the Bible to historical and literary criticism.\n\nIn 1877 Bauer published \"Christus und die Caesaren\" (\"Christ and the Caesars\"), and in 1882 he published \"Disraelis romantischer und Bismarcks socialistischer Imperialismus\" (\"Disraeli's Romantic and Bismarck's Socialist Imperialism\").\n\nBauer's final book on theology, \"Christ and the Caesars\" (1877), was his crowning effort to justify Hegel's position that Christian theology owed at least as much to Greco-Roman classical philosophy as it owed to Judaism.\n\nBruno Bauer died at Rixdorf in 1882. His younger brother, Edgar, was a German left-wing journalist who had supported his brother's fights and was sent to prison for his political positions. He later became a police spy in London for the Danish government, reporting about Karl Marx, among others.\n\nShortly after the death of Hegel, another writer, David Strauss, who had been a reader of Hegel's writings, arrived in Berlin (1831). As a student of Friedrich Schleiermacher he wrote a controversial book which is now famous, entitled, \"The Life of Jesus Critically Examined\", usually referred to as \"The Life of Jesus\" (1835). In this book David Strauss announced his own landmark theory of 'demythologization' as an approach to the Gospels, but he also attempted to use Hegel's name and fame in his book as a marketing ploy.\n\nIn the year of its publication, Strauss' book raised a storm of controversy. The Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV tightened control of the Prussian University system, favoring his ultra-conservative approach to the Bible. He objected to the writing of David Strauss, and he also mistakenly believed that the Hegelian school in general was its source.\n\nBruno Bauer, at 26 years of age, was chosen by the Hegelians to refute David Strauss in the Hegelian \"Journal für wissenschaftliche Kritik\" (Journal of Philosophical Criticism). Bauer ably showed that Strauss misrepresented Hegel, and that Strauss' position differed significantly from Hegel's. Bauer also demonstrated that David Strauss' so-called dialectic was taken from Schleiermacher (who had been antagonistic toward Hegel).\n\nAlthough Strauss' book had sold well throughout Europe, in 1838 Strauss published a rebuttal to Bruno Bauer in a booklet entitled, \"In Defense of my Life of Jesus against the Hegelians\". In that book Strauss admitted publicly that his position had not been inspired by Hegel's philosophy after all, nor by Hegel's theological position (which advocated a dialectical Trinity). Strauss divorced himself from the Hegelians with this booklet, and never joined their ranks again.\n\nHowever, in this final exchange with the Hegelians, he criticised the Hegelian school in a way that has become unforgettable. In that booklet David Strauss invented terms still in use today: a Right Hegelian would uncritically defend all positions of orthodox Christian theology, he said, while a Left Hegelian takes a liberal and progressive approach to Scripture. A \"Centrist Hegelian\" would take the middle road and try to honor both: whatever was rational in theological thinking as well as free scientific thought.\n\nThe Prussian monarch, objecting to these debates, banned many Hegelians from teaching in Universities, including Bruno Bauer. For the rest of his life, Bauer continued to be bitter towards David Strauss.\n\nFor example, when Bauer was middle-aged, a youthful Friedrich Nietzsche came to visit him, seeking advice from a well-known author (because Bruno Bauer did remain well known during his lifetime). Bauer encouraged Nietzsche to criticize David Strauss, and in that early period, that is exactly what young Nietzsche did. Nietzsche in turn mentions later that Bruno Bauer was \"my entire reading public\".\n\nBauer wrote criticism of the New Testament. David Strauss, in his \"Life of Jesus\", had accounted for the Gospel narratives as half-conscious products of the mythic instinct in the early Christian communities. Bauer ridiculed Strauss's notion that a community could produce a connected narrative. Rather, only a single writer could be responsible for the first Gospel. His own contention, embodying a theory of Christian Gottlob Wilke (\"Der Urevangelist\", 1838), was that the original narrative was the Gospel of Mark.\n\nFor Bruno Bauer, the Gospel of Mark was completed in the reign (117–138) of Hadrian (where its prototype, the 'Ur-Marcus,' identifiable within the Gospel of Mark by a critical analysis, was begun around the time of Josephus and the Roman-Jewish Wars). Bauer, like other advocates of this 'Marcan Hypothesis', affirmed that all the other Gospel narratives used the Gospel of Mark as their model within their writing communities.\n\nIn 1906 Albert Schweitzer wrote that Bauer \"originally sought to defend the honor of Jesus by rescuing his reputation from the inane parody of a biography that the Christian apologists had forged.\" However, he eventually came to the belief that it was a complete fiction and \"regarded the Gospel of Mark not only as the first narrator, but even as the creator of the gospel history, thus making the latter a fiction and Christianity the invention of a single original evangelist\" (Otto Pfleiderer).\n\nAlthough Bauer did investigate the 'Ur-Marcus,' it was his remarks on the current version of the Gospel of Mark that captured popular attention. In particular, some key themes in the Gospel of Mark appeared to be literary. The Messianic Secret theme, in which Jesus continually performed wonders and then continually told the viewers not to tell anybody that he did this, seemed to Bauer to be an example of fiction. If the Messianic Secret is a fiction, Bauer wrote, then the redactor who added that theme was probably the final redactor of our current version of the Gospel of Mark. In 1901, Wilhelm Wrede would make his lasting fame by repeating many of Bauer's ideas in his book, \"The Messianic Secret\".\n\nAlso, for some influential theologians in the Tübingen School, several Pauline epistles were regarded as forgeries of the 2nd century. Bauer radicalised that position by suggesting that all Pauline epistles were forgeries, written in the West in antagonism to the Paul of \"The Acts\". Bauer observed a preponderance of the Greco-Roman element, over and above the Jewish element, in Christian writings, and he added a wealth of historical background to support his theory; though modern scholars such as E. P. Sanders and John P. Meier have disputed this theory and attempted to demonstrate a mainly Jewish historical background. Other authors, such as Rudolf Bultmann, tended to agree that a Greco-Roman element was dominant.\n\nAccording to Bruno Bauer, the writer of Mark's gospel was \"an Italian, at home both in Rome and Alexandria\"; that of Matthew's gospel \"a Roman, nourished by the spirit of Seneca\"; Christianity is essentially \"Stoicism triumphant in a Jewish garb.\"\n\nWhat Bruno Bauer added was a deep review of European literature in the 1st century. In his estimation, many key themes of the New Testament, especially those that are opposed to themes in the Old Testament, can be found with relative ease in Greco-Roman literature that flourished during the 1st century. Such a position was also maintained by some Jewish scholars.\n\nBauer's final book, \"Christ and the Caesars\" (1877) offers a penetrating analysis that shows common key-words in the words of 1st-century writers like Seneca the Stoic and New Testament texts. While this had been perceived even in ancient times, the ancient explanation was that Seneca 'must have been' a secret Christian. Bruno Bauer was perhaps the first to attempt to carefully demonstrate that some New Testament writers freely borrowed from Seneca the Stoic. One modern explanation is that common cultures share common thought-forms and common patterns of speech; that similarities do not necessarily indicate borrowing.\n\nIn \"Christ and the Caesars\", Bauer argued that Judaism entered Rome during the era of the Maccabees, and increased in population and influence in Rome since that time. He cited literature from the 1st century to strengthen his case that Jewish influence in Rome was far greater than historians had yet reported. The Imperial throne was influenced by the Jewish religious genius, he said, citing Herod's relation with the Caesar family, as well as the famous relationship between Josephus and the Flavians, Vespasian and Titus, and also one of the poems of Horace.\n\nAccording to Bruno Bauer, Julius Caesar sought to interpret his own life as an Oriental miracle story, and Augustus Caesar completed that job by commissioning Virgil to write his \"Aeneid\", making Caesar into the Son of Venus and a relative of the Trojans, thereby justifying the Roman conquest of Greece and insinuating Rome into a much older history.\n\nBy contrast, said Bauer, Vespasian was far more fortunate, since he had Josephus himself to link his reign with an Oriental miracle. Josephus had prophesied that Vespasian would become Emperor of Rome and thus ruler of the world. This actually happened, and in this way the Roman conquest of Judea was justified and insinuated Rome into an even older history.\n\nAccording to Albert Schweitzer, Bruno Bauer's criticisms of the New Testament provided the most interesting questions about the historical Jesus that he had seen.\n\nJudging by the second-to-last chapter of his \"Quest,\" Schweitzer's own theology was partly based on Bauer's writings. The title of that chapter is \"Thoroughgoing Skepticism and Eschatology.\" In that chapter Schweitzer clashes head-on with Wilhelm Wrede, who had recently (in 1905) proposed the theory of a Messianic Secret. Wrede's theory claimed that Jesus' continual commands to his followers to \"say nothing to anybody\" after each miracle was performed could only be explained as a literary invention of this Gospel writer. (That is, Wrede was the thoroughgoing skeptic, and Schweitzer was the thoroughgoing eschatologist.) Schweitzer began by showing that Wrede had merely copied this idea from Bruno Bauer. Then Schweizter listed another forty brilliant criticisms from Bruno Bauer (pp. 334–335) some of which he disagreed with (such as the so-called Messianic Secret) and some of which he considered indispensable for any modern theology of the Gospel.\n\nThis line of criticism has value in emphasizing the importance of studying the influence of environment in the formation of the Christian Scriptures. Bauer was a man of restless creativity, interdisciplinary activity and independent judgment. Many reviewers have charged that Bauer's judgment was ill-balanced, Due to the controversial nature of his work as a social theorist, theologian and historian, Bauer was banned from public teaching by a Prussian monarch. After many years of similar censorship, Bauer came to resign himself to his place as a free-lance critic, rather than as an official teacher.\n\nDouglas Moggach published \"The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer\" in 2003. This is the most comprehensive overview of Bauer's life and works, in English to date. Bauer's biography has obtained more kindly reviews these days, even by opponents. In his own day, his opponents often respected him, since he was not afraid of taking a line on principle.\n\nOne point that is often raised in this regard is his line that was displeasing to his liberal friends on the Jewish question (\"Die Judenfrage\", 1843).\nBauers later article \"Jews abroad\" (Das Judentum in der Fremde) in \"Staats- und Gesellschaftslexicon\" was even more radical and extensive, mixing arguments of racism, religion and \"voelkisch\" ideology.\n\nThe topic of Bauer's personal religious views or lack thereof is a continuing debate in contemporary scholarship about Bruno Bauer. One modern writer, Paul Trejo (2002), has made the case that Bauer remained a radical theologian who criticized specific types of Christianity, and that Bauer maintained a Hegelian interpretation of Christianity throughout his life. According to Trejo, Bauer's book, \"Christianity Exposed\" (1843), was very mild, only setting one sect of Christian against another. Further, opined Trejo, Bauer's \"Trumpet of the Last Judgment against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist\" was a comedy – actually a prank – in which Bauer pretended to be a right-wing cleric who was attacking Hegel. When many right-wing readers publicly praised the book, Bauer revealed himself as the actual author and had a good laugh.\n\n\"The Trumpet\", written by Bauer and published anonymously, was of inspiration to Gianfranco Sanguinetti, for his 1975 pamphlet \"Veritable Report on the Last Chances to Save Capitalism in Italy\", a Situationist prank which caused him to leave Italy under the force of political pressure.\n\nBeginning in 1848, critics accused Bauer of promoting a virulent antisemitism in print within reactionary circles. Bauer's view of Jews and Judaism is considered by some to have been absolutely negative, both when considering the past and when contemplating the present.\n\nIn 1843, Bauer wrote The Jewish Question, which was responded to in a pamphlet written by Karl Marx, entitled, \"On the Jewish Question\". According to Marx, Bauer argued that the Jews were responsible for their own misfortunes in European society since they had \"made their nest in the pores and interstices of bourgeois society\". \nJacob Katz contextualizes Bauer's antisemitism with his passionate anti-Christianity, the latter of which caused Bauer to lose his professorship. Although, according to Katz, Bauer was \"equally impatient with Christianity and Judaism\", Bauer would frequently diverge from a review or opinion piece on a Jewish writer or thinker into a general consideration of \"the Jew as a type\", grasping at whatever negative characteristics he could find.\n\nThe first English-language rendering of Bruno Bauer's career was published in March, 2003 by Douglas Moggach, a professor at the University of Ottawa. His book is entitled, \"The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer\". Professor Moggach develops a republican interpretation of Bruno Bauer, in which Bauer is portrayed as reaching atheist conclusions because of his political commitments to free self-consciousness and autonomy, and his criticisms of the Restoration union of church and state. Other scholars continue to dispute that portrait.\n\nBauer's personality was complex. During his career and even after he died he was difficult to classify. The left-wing tried to define him as one of their own. The right-wing tried to define him as one of their own. He was praised by the right-Hegelians, and he was praised by the left-Hegelians.\n\nBauer had studied directly under the German philosopher Friedrich Hegel. Hegel had awarded an academic prize to Bauer when Bauer was about 20 years old. Hegel died when Bruno Bauer was 22 years old. Perhaps this affected Bauer's personality strongly; he may have seen himself as sitting very close to the highest academic post in Prussia and possibly he imagined that he would one day have that post.\n\nWhen Hegel unexpectedly died in 1831, possibly of cholera, Bruno Bauer's official connections were drastically reduced. Bauer had very few powerful friends during the academic fallout after Hegel's death.\n\nAfter the publication of his 'The Trumpet' (1841) he was considered as an important representative of the radicals.\n\nThe struggle with David Strauss and especially with the Prussian monarchy had set Bruno Bauer back quite a bit.\nThis also affected Bauer's personality.\n\nBauer went underground and began to write Hegelian newspapers here and there. In this journey he met some socialists, including Karl Marx, his former student, and Marx' new friends, Friedrich Engels and Arnold Ruge. They were all left-wing radicals. Bauer was not a left-wing radical, but he was happy to be their leader if it could lead them back to a Hegelian understanding of the dialectic. Another member of those Young Hegelians, Max Stirner, became Bauer's lifelong friend. Although Bauer was not a radical egoist, he preferred the writings of Stirner to the writings of Marx, Engels and Ruge.\n\nShortly after, Marx and Engels broke sharply with Bruno Bauer and attacked him specifically in a critique of one of his works, \"On the Jewish Question\" and in other books that were critical of various Young Hegelians including Bauer, \"The Holy Family\", and \"The German Ideology\".\n\nBruno Bauer met with Marx again in London in the mid-1850s, while visiting his exiled brother Edgar there. According to Marx's correspondence with Engels, Bauer presented him with a copy of Hegel's Science of Logic. Marx referred to this volume while completing his drafts of 'Capital'.\n\nBauer had already turned away from the socialism and communism of Marx and Engels, so he was immune to the barbs they wrote in \"The Holy Family or Critique of Critical Criticism. Against Bruno Bauer and Company\" by his pupils, Marx and Engels. Nevertheless, he had fallen quite far – from a favorite son of Hegel himself down to an enemy of both the right-wing and the left-wing as well. He found very few friends in this intellectual position aside from Max Stirner. According to some sources he contemplated suicide. According to other sources, his enemies only wished that he contemplated suicide.\n\nSuppressed and condemned by both the right-wing and the left-wing, the once-influential Bruno Bauer finally settled into his family's tobacco shop to earn his living, though he continued to write. He never married, but he wrote books for the rest of his life.\n\nBauer's scholarship was buried by German academia, and he remained a pariah, until Albert Kalthoff rescued his works from neglect and obscurity. Kalthoff revived Bauer's Christ Myth thesis in his \"Das Christus-Problem. Grundlinien zu einer Sozialtheologie\" (\"The Problem of Christ: Principles of a Social Theology\", 1902) and \"Die Entstehung des Christentums, Neue Beiträge zum Christusproblem\" (\"The Rise of Christianity\", 1904).\nAlbert Schweitzer a historian of theology, who presented an important critical review of the history of the search for Jesus's life in \"Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung\" (\"The Quest of the Historical Jesus, 1906\"), highly praised Bauer's early work.\n\nArthur Drews noted Bauer's views in his own work \"The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present\", \"Christianity is the product of the intimidated class of Romans who needed a straw of hope and faith in their struggle against the egoism of Caesars. It's absurd to suppose it to be originating from Hierosolyma [Jerusalem]. The origin of the Gospel literature is then reexamined. Originally, it's just a demonstration of the new principle of freedom, in rebellion against the law-dominated world, represented by Judaism. The Gospels demonstrate various steps in the evolution of this esteem. The main factor of influence was of the Roman empire, whose oppression forced the community to look for hope in a kingdom of heavens and exterminating the kingdom of Rome to make it possible. ...Absolutely no such thing as a historical Jesus of Galilee is needed to explain the genesis of Mark's gospel.\" Modern scholar Robert M. Price wrote: Reading the prescient Bruno Bauer one has the eerie feeling that a century of New Testament scholarship may find itself ending up where it began. For instance, the work of Burton Mack, Vernon Robbins, and others makes a powerful case for understanding the gospels as Cynic-Stoic in tone... Robert M. Fowler, Frank Kermode, and Randel Helms have demonstrated how thoroughly the gospels smack of fictional composition. Thus, from many directions, New Testament researchers seem to be converging uncannily on the theses that Bruno Bauer set forth over a century ago.\n\nBauer became the first author to systematically argue that Jesus did not exist. Beginning in 1841, in his \"Criticism of the Gospel History of the Synoptics\", Bauer argued that the Biblical Jesus was primarily a literary figure. However, he left open the question of whether a historical Jesus existed at all until his 1851 work, \"Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin\" and then in 1877 proposed his theory for the true origin of Jesus in \"Christ and the Caesars\".\n\nBauer's 1842 work, \"Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker und des Johannes\" (3 vol) argued that the gospels were purely literary, with no historically authentic material. While not yet rejecting the historicity of Jesus, Bauer denied the historicity of a supernatural Christ (viz. Jesus—a natural human). Bauer wrote, \"Everything that the historical Christ is, everything that is said of Him, everything that is known of Him, belongs to the world of imagination, that is, of the imagination of the Christian community, and therefore has nothing to do with any man who belongs to the real world.\" (see David Strauss (1808–1874) who pioneered the search for the \"Historical Jesus\" by also rejecting the supernatural events of \"The Christ\", in his 1835 work, \"Life of Jesus\").\n\nIn his \"Criticism of the Pauline Epistles\" (1850–1852) and in \"A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin\" (1850–1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed. Schweitzer notes, \"At the end of his study of the Gospels, Bauer is inclined to make the decision of the question whether there ever was a historic Jesus depend on the result of a further investigation which he proposed to make into the Pauline Epistles. It was not until ten years later (1850–1851) that he accomplished this task, (\"Kritik der Paidinischen Briefe\". (Criticism of the Pauline Epistles.) Berlin, 1850-1852.) and applied the result in his new edition of the \"Criticism of the Gospel History.\" (\"Kritik der Evangelien und Geschichte ihres Ursprungs.\" (Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin.) 2 vols., Berlin, 1850-1851.) The result is negative: there never was any historical Jesus.\"\n\nIn \"Christ and the Caesars\" (1877) he suggested that Christianity was a synthesis of the Stoicism of Seneca the Younger and of the Jewish theology of Philo as developed by pro-Roman Jews such as Josephus. Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time; in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn, and his work did not have much impact on future myth theorists.\n\nChrist myth theory proponents still assert the threefold argument originally asserted by Bauer:\n\n\nThe great bulk of Bauer's writings have still not been translated into English. Only two books by Bauer have been formally translated; a comedic parody, \"The Trumpet of the Last Judgment Against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist\" (1841, trans. Lawrence Stepelevich, 1989), and \"Christianity Exposed: A Recollection of the 18th Century and a Contribution to the Crisis of the 19th\" (1843, ed. Paul Trejo, 2002). A third book, Bauer's great, \"Christ and the Caesars\" (1877, Charleston House Publishing, 1999) was published informally, perhaps as a software-generated translation under a pseudonym, \"Frank E. Schacht.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "551253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=551253", "title": "Captain &amp; Tennille", "text": "Captain &amp; Tennille\n\nThe Captain & Tennille were American recording artists whose primary success occurred in the 1970s. The husband-and-wife duo were \"Captain\" Daryl Dragon (born August 27, 1942) and Cathryn Antoinette \"Toni\" Tennille (born May 8, 1940). They have five albums certified gold or platinum and scored numerous hits on the US singles charts, the most enduring of which included \"Love Will Keep Us Together\", \"Do That to Me One More Time\", and \"Muskrat Love\". They hosted their own television variety series on ABC in 1976–77.\n\nIn 1972, Toni Tennille was the co-writer of an ecology-themed musical, \"Mother Earth\". At that time, Daryl Dragon (son of composer Carmen Dragon) was working as a keyboardist for the Beach Boys. When Tennille's show was preparing to move from San Francisco's Marines Memorial Theatre to Southern California's South Coast Repertory, a call was put out for a replacement keyboardist. Dragon was between tours when he heard about the opening, met Tennille in San Francisco to audition, and landed the gig.\n\nDragon later reciprocated by recommending Tennille to the Beach Boys when the band needed an additional keyboardist, and they hired her. She toured with them for a year, and has since been known as The Beach Boys' one and only \"Beach Girl\".\n\nRealizing their collaborative potential when the tour was over, Tennille and Dragon began performing as a duo at the now-defunct Smokehouse Restaurant in Encino, California. They started to become popular in the Los Angeles area, and their early version of the Tennille-penned \"The Way I Want to Touch You\" became popular on a local radio station. This led to a recording contract with A&M Records.\n\nTheir first hit single, a rendition of Neil Sedaka's and Howard Greenfield's \"Love Will Keep Us Together\", reached #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart nine weeks after its 1975 debut, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on July 1, 1975. Tennille paid tribute to Sedaka in the recording when she sang the overdub \"Sedaka is back\" at the end of the song. The duo successfully mined the Sedaka songbook a number of times over their chartmaking career. Two of their other hit singles were the Sedaka co-writes \"Lonely Night (Angel Face)\" and \"You Never Done It Like That\". Their Spanish recording of \"Love Will Keep Us Together\", \"Por Amor Viviremos\", also charted in 1975; it was the first time two versions of the same single charted simultaneously. Tennille and Dragon included renditions of several other Sedaka songs on their albums.\n\nTennille and Dragon married on November 11, 1975 (not on Valentine's Day 1974, as is often erroneously reported, for example, on the February 14, 1976 edition of Casey Kasem's American Top 40).\n\nOver the next few years, Captain and Tennille released a string of hit singles mostly from their first two albums \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" (US #2, 1975) and \"Song Of Joy\" (US #9, 1976) including \"The Way I Want to Touch You\" (US #4), \"Lonely Night (Angel Face)\" (US #3), \"Shop Around\" (US #4), and \"Muskrat Love\" (US #4).\n\nIn July 1976, they were invited by First Lady Betty Ford to perform in the East Room of the White House in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II and President Gerald Ford during the country's bicentennial celebration. After a long journey, the Queen fell asleep during their show.\n\nSuch was the level of their popularity that they were given their own television variety show. \"The Captain and Tennille\" TV show aired from September 1976 to March 1977 on ABC. It featured musical numbers and comedy sketches performed with various guest stars. However, despite solid ratings success, the duo wanted to focus on their music and touring career and, after one season, asked to be released from their contract.\n\nThe duo's third album \"Come in from the Rain\" (US #18, 1977) produced three singles: \"Can't Stop Dancing\" (US #13), the title track (US #61), and \"Circles\", which did not chart. A&M Records later released a Greatest Hits album (1977) which peaked at #55 on the US Top 200.\n\nThe duo released their fourth studio album \"Dream\" (US #131, 1978), although their first single \"I'm on My Way\" (US #74) failed to become a hit. However, their second single, and third Sedaka title, \"You Never Done It Like That,\" fared much better at #10. A third single was \"You Need a Woman Tonight\" (US #40). \"Dream\" would be the last Captain and Tennille studio album released by A&M.\n\nIn 1979, Neil Bogart signed them to a contract on his Casablanca Records label. The album \"Make Your Move\" (US #23, 1979) rose much higher on the chart than the act's previous release, and the first single \"Do That to Me One More Time\" reached the summit on February 16, 1980, becoming their second #1 single. However, subsequent singles \"Love on a Shoestring\" (US #55) and \"Happy Together (A Fantasy)\" (US #53) only achieved minimal success.\n\n\"Keeping Our Love Warm\" (1980) was the duo's second Casablanca release, and sixth studio album overall, but failed to crack the Top 200. The first single from this album, the title track, was performed live (although lip synced) during the 1980 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nDuring the duo's period of highest popularity, Tennille also worked as a session singer (most frequently partnered with The Beach Boys' Bruce Johnston), performing as a backing vocalist on the Elton John albums \"Caribou\", \"Blue Moves\", and \"21 at 33\" (some vocally arranged by Dragon) and most notably on the hit track \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\". She also appeared as a backing vocalist on tracks by Art Garfunkel and The Beach Boys, as well as Pink Floyd for whom she performed backing tracks on \"The Wall\" album.\n\nIn the liner notes of the Captain & Tennille anthology \"Ultimate Collection: The Complete Greatest Hits\", Tennille explains how her work on Pink Floyd's album gained her at least one new fan:\n\nToni Tennille hosted her own syndicated television talk show from September 1980 to January 1981.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, they continued to perform various concert dates at venues around the world, frequently at Harrah's Lake Tahoe and Harrah's Reno, which were located close to their home near Carson City, Nevada. One of their more notable appearances in that decade occurred when they played at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in 1995, as part of their 20th anniversary as an act.\n\nAt the same time throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Tennille enjoyed a second career as a big band and pop standard singer, not unlike pop colleague Linda Ronstadt. She performed with orchestras throughout the country and subsequently recorded several solo albums including Mirage Records' \"More Than You Know\" (1984), and \"All of Me\" on Gaia Records in 1987.\n\nIn 1999, on Cartoon Network, the duo made a guest appearance, interviewed by Harvey Birdman, rather than Space Ghost (who is sent to jail and breaks out) in an episode of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\".\n\nIn 2001, on the popular television series, Friends, the duo was referenced in \"The One With Joey's Award.\"\n\nToni Tennille also enjoyed a year as the star of the Broadway tour of \"Victor/Victoria\". At the end of that project, she and Dragon were to have embarked on a 25th anniversary tour; however, the stresses of the road proved too demanding and Captain & Tennille instead put an indefinite hold on their career as a performing duo. Nevertheless, Captain & Tennille's popularity remained evident in the release of their \"Ultimate Collection: The Complete Hits\" on Hip-O Records (a subsidiary of Universal Records) in 2001, and \"More Than Dancing... Much More\", a 2002 compact disc. The latter contains what was originally their final album in 1982, \"More Than Dancing\", which at that time was released only in Australia, and is combined with selected tracks from their 1995 \"20 Years of Romance\", originally on K-Tel (re-recording of their songs, and cover versions of others), as well as five newly released tracks.\n\nIn November 2003, Tennille performed a benefit concert for the Reno, Nevada Chamber Orchestra, where her surprise guest was Dragon. It was the first time they had publicly performed as Captain & Tennille in many years. Their first live recording, \"An Intimate Evening with Toni Tennille\", was released to commemorate the event.\n\nIn 2005, Brant Berry, the vice president of a small Portland, Oregon–based entertainment company, Respond 2 Entertainment (R2), signed an agreement with Captain & Tennille to release three projects. The first was the home video release of Captain & Tennille's 1976 variety series, on a three-disc DVD set containing 11 complete episodes with bonus musical tracks. Second, R2 re-released all six of their albums, both from the original A&M and Casablanca labels, on newly remastered CDs. Several of the CDs were previously available only in Japan. The new CDs, packaged both as individual CDs and in a box set, contained new liner notes written by Tennille.\n\nThird, a new recording by Captain & Tennille was released—a three-song Christmas CD entitled \"Saving Up Christmas\". This effort was followed by \"The Secret of Christmas\" released on Captain & Tennille's own label, Purebred Records, on November 1, 2006. It was Captain & Tennille's first complete original album produced in more than a decade, and their first-ever Christmas album.\n\nTennille returned to the UK airwaves and to club play when the band Bent sampled a small portion of her vocals from Captain & Tennille's 1979 track, \"Love on a Shoestring\" (from the album \"Make Your Move\"), into their \"Magic Love\" single in 2003. An Ashley Beedle remix of the single heightened the danceability of the original ambient track.\n\nIn October 2006, Cartoon Network's animated special \"Casper's Scare School\" was aired. The duo recorded two songs for the film, and voiced the dialog for the characters who sang the songs. Tennille portrayed Aunt Belle and the Captain was Uncle Murray, who together formed a two-head-on-one-body being known as the Ankle. The two songs they performed, \"Why Does Love Make Me Feel So Good\" and \"World Without Fear,\" were written by Magnus Fiennes. Captain & Tennille's co-stars on the show included Phyllis Diller, James Belushi, Dan Castellaneta, and Bob Saget.\n\nIn 2007, three new DVDs were released of Captain & Tennille's ABC TV specials: \"Captain & Tennille in Hawaii\", \"Captain & Tennille in New Orleans\", and \"Captain & Tennille Songbook\".\n\nDragon and Tennille spent most of the 1990s and 2000s living in the Carson City area of Nevada, where they had lived for more than fifteen years, and where Tennille served as Ambassador for the Arts for the state. In the mid-2000s, they temporarily took year-round residence at their second home, located in the Palm Springs area of Southern California. In 2008 they sold their home near Carson City, and built a house and settled down in Prescott, Arizona, where Tennille participates in the annual Prescott Jazz Summit.\n\nTennille filed for divorce from Dragon in the State of Arizona on January 16, 2014, after 39 years of marriage. Dragon was unaware of the termination of his marriage until he was served with the divorce papers. The divorce documents referenced health insurance or health issues, and Tennille had written on her blog in 2010 that Dragon's neurological condition, similar to Parkinson’s, known as essential tremor, was characterized by such extreme tremors he could no longer play keyboards. Dragon later stated that some of his health problems were the result of errors in dosing his medication, a problem which has since been fixed; he and Tennille remain on speaking terms.\n\n\n\n\n"}

During World War I, daily life was affected as men were drafted and sent abroad, and women had to fill their places in the factories. Youth programs grew and developed in a response to aid the government with these new programs. During and after the war, life for children in the United States was greatly affected in a variety of ways.\nMore than 116,000 members of the U.S. military died in the war, far fewer than combatants from other countries. No one has estimated how many orphans resulted. Additionally, as the male workforce left for battle, mothers and sisters began working in factories to take their positions, and the family dynamic began to change; this affected children as they had less time to spend with family members and were expected to grow up faster and help with the war effort. Similarly, Woodrow Wilson called on children involved in youth organizations to help collect money for war bonds and stamps in order to raise money for the war effort. This was a way to mobilize public opinion and shame adults who did not donate. The Office of War Information and other agencies implemented programs and created posters and pamphlets to encourage war support.\n\nThe United States was involved in World War I for the last 19 months of the war (April 1917 to November 1918), 4,355,000 men were conscripted into service. By summer 1918, they were trained and shipped to France at the rate of 10,000 military personnel a day.\n\nMeanwhile, every farm, town and city, and every economic sector, was mobilized for the war effort. Tens of millions of parents took war jobs or joined voluntary organizations such as the Red Cross. This involvement changed the course of the war and directly affected daily life, education, and family structures of children in the United States. The home front saw a systematic mobilization of the entire population and the entire economy to produce the soldiers, food supplies, munitions, and money needed to win the war. Although the United States entered the war in 1917, there had been very little planning, or even recognition of the problems that the British and other Allies had to solve on their homefronts. As a result, the level of confusion was high in the first 12 months, then efficiency took control.\n\nAfter the United States entered the war, daily life was affected for most as men prepared for battle, women began working, and children and families had less time to spend together. The women and children did much more work than they used to. Children were affected as many of their fathers were killed or maimed in battle, and their mothers began working long hours in the factories. As the war progressed, technology advanced and industry boomed, enabling women to spend less time on household chores and more time outside of the home. The American family began to change as women started working more regularly, which affected the role of the child in American life.\n\nOver 21 million people were killed or injured in World War I; in many cases, all of the men in one family were killed, numerous cities in Europe were destroyed, and family life throughout the world was greatly affected. While the United States suffered the fewest casualties, family life was still greatly affected as husbands were deployed and wives had to begin working. As the war draft suddenly removed many men from factory work, the factories began soliciting for women workers in traditionally male-dominated areas. Therefore, women had less time to spend at home with the children, as many of them would have before the war. As fathers, uncles, brothers, and grandfathers deployed in military service, women filled their places in factories and offices, changing the ways young children and teens received home nurturing. Additionally, women moving into new roles in society had lasting effects on children and family life after the war. President Woodrow Wilson stated, \"We have made partners of the women in this war; shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?\" As women began working in the factories, more of society began to realize the need for women's rights; while women had been granted suffrage (voting rights) to varying degrees in several states beginning in the late 19th century, they were now guaranteed full suffrage throughout the United States by the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution passed in August, 1920. This also paved the way for the children of future generations by creating greater career opportunities for girls and women; as women gained a stronger voice, girls became more involved in the workforce and education and prepared for roles outside of the home. Additionally, family life was affected after the war as more and more women entered the work force, moving away from the traditional stay-at-home mother and housewife role.\n\nOver the course of the war, the United States mobilized hundreds of thousands of men and endured an estimated 117,465 casualties. Of the men who survived and returned home, post-traumatic stress disorder created a major impact on society. During this time, and still today, post-traumatic stress (then more likely to be known as \"shell shock\") was not fully understood, but because of the traumatic nature of battle, many men were negatively affected after the war. Some men were forced to leave battle, which many people considered cowardice, and there were asylums throughout Europe housing men suffering from this condition. In some extreme cases, men were even shot for showing weakness. There are still people living today who lost family members because of this practice, which created lasting impacts on these children. Additionally, many of these men were teenagers when they left for war, and virtually all were under the age of 30; therefore many of these soldiers were barely out of childhood themselves.\n\nFurthermore, because over a million young men were deployed overseas, marriage had to be postponed. In addition, a large number of the military personnel who returned home suffered from serious permanent injuries.\n\nOn the home front, domestic appliances were being created, alleviating the amount of time that women needed to spend on chores, so they had more time to work outside of the home. Additionally, this lessened the need for female servants, as things like laundry services and food preparation services became popular. Therefore, women were able to move into more traditionally male-dominated areas, as technology began to do the service jobs that women primarily were responsible for. Additionally, this showed young girls that they could eventually work outside of the home and more opportunities were available to them after they completed their education.\n\nWorld War I altered education in the United States through curriculum changes with government pamphlets and required patriotism sessions. Even though the United States was only involved in World War I for a short period of time, the government instituted many programs for and changes to American education. During this war period, there was a strong focus on nationalism and patriotism, which significantly affected education. Woodrow Wilson and the United States government funded a series of pamphlets, posters, bulletins, and speeches, which promoted strong nationalism and anti-German sentiments. These forms of nationalist propaganda were used nationwide in public school districts and influenced students to remain loyal to the United States. These programs promoted things like volunteering with federal organizations such as the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and buying War Bonds to support the government.\n\nAdditionally, the government created several programs to help support education such as the Committee of Public Information (CPI), the National Education Association (NEA), and the Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education, all of which promoted nationalist movements and changes to education. For example, as part of the CPI and NEA programs, with the assistance of Woodrow Wilson, pamphlets were published advocating democracy and national patriotism in schools. These pamphlets also focused on a new movement of social efficacy, which strongly favored students growing as people and becoming involved, patriotic citizens. Another main goal of these educational programs was a move away from state education systems and toward a nationalized system of education, which would keep curriculums similar and promote a unified nation among students. For example, the national government changed textbooks to portray the American Revolution in a way that didn't make Britain look like the bad guys. This was important because the United States allied with Great Britain.\n\nStarting as early as the elementary level, patriotic and pro-war lessons were instituted in public schools. They included things such as weekly fifteen-minute periods on patriotism for first and second grades. They stressed that teachers instruct the children so that they viewed the war in a positive manner and portrayed war in terms of celebrations, and victories, not destructive realities. An elementary pamphlet stated, \"In teaching the war to young pupils, the appeal should be directed primarily to the imagination and to the emotions. It is not enough that our pupils shall be informed of the events of the war...Their imaginations must be awakened and their feelings aroused to an appreciation of the significance of the great happenings of the times.\" Therefore, starting at a very early level, students were taught that the war was a good thing and the importance of patriotism.\n\nThe patriotic sentiments were also carried out in secondary settings. Specific programs and in-school curricula targeted the patriotic development of children, especially teens. New history curricula introduced rewrote the story of the American past to de-emphasize the friction between the colonies and Britain, and to deconstruct historical American and German amity, to vilify the Germans. For example, every senior in high school received their own pamphlet in January 1918 called \"Study of the Great War.\" This attempted to encourage enmity for Germany and emphasized the importance of an Allied victory. Things like the importance of the ROTC program were also stressed during this time. Nationalist posters and other forms of propaganda were placed in public areas throughout the country and again showed the importance of patriotism. Posters, like the Boy Scout poster shown below, depicted teenagers helping the war effort as being courageous and admired. This form of propaganda was especially influential on teenagers because most of them were trying to figure out their roles in society and desired to fit in; therefore, posters showing their peers serving their country and receiving recognition and respect, were particularly influential in persuading teenagers to join the war effort in whatever way they could.\n\nAfter the war ended, nationalist movements changed to a larger focus on international peace. There were strong government movements toward peace and anti-war sentiments and the need to avoid further wars. Additionally, there was a focus on internationalization of higher education. For example, in 1920, the Belgian American Educational Foundation instituted a program with over 700 students, in which American students went to study in Belgium and vice versa in order to promote international understanding.\n\nAs a result of World War I, youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls greatly expanded, helping to raise money for the war effort.\n\nDue to the large nationalist movement during World War I, many youth organizations were developed or expanded, including the Boy Scouts of America. During World War I, Woodrow Wilson placed a great importance on the Boy Scouts of America, asking them to encourage war support and educate the public sources about the importance of the war. They helped distribute the war pamphlets, helped sell war bonds and helped to drive nationalism and support for the war. Additionally, they were involved in many acts that helped the national government, such as locating black walnut to use in war materials and peach pits for gas masks. The Boy Scouts were involved in five Liberty Bond drives in which they helped sell Liberty Bonds to benefit the American Government. During the first campaign, they raised a total of $23,000,000 and in the second drive they collected $. For the third campaign, known as the \"Wake Up, America\" rally, beginning on April 27, 1918, 400,000 Boy Scouts embarked on a door to window program selling Liberty Bonds as well as war stamps. At the end of the five campaigns, the Boy Scouts raised $354,859,262 in bond subscriptions and $43,043,698 in war stamps. When a Boy Scout sold a bond or stamp, he would record the sale and send in a post card to his local post office, which would then forward it to the bonds and stamps, he would receive an \"Ace Medal\".\n\nDuring World War I Camp Fire Girls helped to sell over one million dollars in Liberty Bonds and over $900,000 in Thrift Stamps; 55,000 girls helped to support French and Belgian orphans, and an estimated 68,000 girls earned honors by conservation of food.\n\nAfter the conclusion of World War I, the United States and the rest of the world changed. Those who were children during World War I grew up to become the adults of World War II. These children were exposed to propaganda and indoctrinated to value strong nationalism and loyalty to the United States and its allies. Therefore, when World War II was on the forefront, many of the adults in the United States still harbored negative feelings toward the Germans because of their schooling during World War I.\n\nAdditionally, women were granted suffrage shortly after World War I. This was partly due to the fact that they had moved away from their traditional roles and filled the factory jobs that the men were forced to leave in order to serve in World War I. Women showed their importance in society, which fueled many women's rights movements post–World War I. The girls who were in school during World War I were also learning about the importance of nationalism, and saw their mothers fulfilling traditionally male-dominated roles. This desire for nationalism and exposure to wider opportunities helped to enable these girls to grow up and become involved in securing rights for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n"}

By 1849, having planted 22,000 seedlings, he had created a large, sweet variety from a native species, which he called 'Concord', and by 1853 the grapes were for sale. However, within several years, competing growers had begun raising their own crops of Concord grapes, purchased from Bull for $5 per vine, and Bull saw little profit from the strain after the initial sales.\n\nEphraim Bull was later elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1855.

He was released in 2004 and has since written critical pieces highlighting alleged malpractice by local governments and forced evictions.\n\nOutside China, Feng is best known for having been refused re-entry into China eight times in 2009, despite being a Chinese citizen. He protested and remained in the immigration hall of Narita International Airport for 92 days, attracted concern from Asian activists, and received worldwide media attention.\n\nFeng was born in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. He started his business in 1980s and later founded the Institute of China Business Development. He lives in Shanghai; he has a sister, who lives in Japan with her Japanese husband.\n\nHe criticized the Chinese government and the People's Liberation Army for suppressing the democratization of the Chinese society. He later went to study in Japan and returned to China, and was imprisoned in 2001 for \"illegal business activities\".\nSince 2007 Feng edited \"Supervision Bulletin\" a 1000-copy circulation monthly newsletter reporting on cases of social injustices and official breaches of the law, such as studies of ordinary folk who had had their property seized or had rights violated by the authorities.

On attempting to return home in June, he was refused entry by the authorities. According to Feng's sister, airlines prevented him from boarding a China-bound flight four times; on the four occasions he succeeded in boarding a plane, Chinese authorities at Shanghai turned him away. A Japanese immigration official said Feng arrived from Shanghai on 4 November with a valid Chinese passport and a visa to enter Japan – but has refused to enter Japan, opting instead to attempt return to China. He spent his time on a couch near an immigration checkpoint in the south wing of Terminal 1 of Narita Airport, subsisting on snacks given to him by travellers and activists (including Hong Kong activist Christina Chan). He has been likened to the Tom Hanks character in Steven Spielberg's 2004 film \"The Terminal\", and has watched the film on DVD.

He served with distinction at the sieges of Saint-Jean-d'Angély, Montauban, Royan and Montpellier.\n\nAfter fighting a duel against the Comte de Pontgibaud, he killed the Marquis de Portes in 1625. Dueling had long been forbidden, but the penalty of death was rarely enforced. Cardinal Richelieu, who believed the severity of the penalty contributed to its lack of enforcement, argued for its liberalization. An edict of February 1626 restricted the death penalty to duels in which one of the participants died, or the seconds also dueled. It was registered by \"parlement\" on 24 March. Montmorency-Bouteville dueled and killed Jacques de Matignon, Comte de Thorigny, on 25 March. He injured the Baron de la Frette in 1627, then fled to Brussels to escape the wrath of Louis XIII.

He finished high school in the 10th grade and held a job at a Cleveland airport; he also acquired a pilot's license. At 20, he headed for California, where at first he worked for a garage owned by an uncle.\n\nWhile working at the garage he met Frank Critzer, an eccentric loner who claimed to be working a mine somewhere near Giant Rock, a 7-story boulder near Landers, California. Frank Critzer was a German immigrant trying to make a living in the desert as a prospector. During World War II, Critzer was under suspicion as a German spy and died during a police siege at the Rock in 1942. Upon receiving news of Critzer's death, Van Tassel applied for a lease of the abandoned airport near Giant Rock from the Bureau of Land Management, who managed the land, and was eventually given a renewable Federal Government contract to develop the airstrip.\n\nVan Tassel became an aircraft mechanic and flight inspector who at various times between 1930 and 1947 worked for Douglas Aircraft, Hughes Aircraft, and Lockheed. While at Hughes Aircraft he was the Top Flight Inspector. He finally left Southern California's booming aerospace industry for the desert in 1947. He and his family at first lived a simple existence in the rooms Frank Critzer had dug out under Giant Rock. Van Tassel eventually built a home, a cafe, a small airstrip, and a dude ranch beside the Rock.\n\nGeorge Van Tassel died of a heart attack in 1978.\n\nGeorge Van Tassel started hosting group meditation in 1953 in a room underneath Giant Rock excavated by Frank Critzer, a prospector. That year, according to Van Tassel the occupant of a space ship from the planet Venus woke him up, invited him on board his space ship, and both verbally and telepathically gave him a technique for rejuvenating the human body. In 1954, Van Tassel and others began building what they called the \"Integratron\" to perform the rejuvenation. According to Van Tassel, the Integratron was to be a structure for scientific research into time, anti-gravity and at extending human life, built partially upon the research of Nikola Tesla and Georges Lakhovsky. Van Tassel described the Integratron as being created for scientific and spiritual research with the aim to recharge and rejuvenate people's cells, \"a time machine for basic research on rejuvenation, anti-gravity and time travel\". The domed wood structure has a rotating metal apparatus on the outside he called an \"electrostatic dirod\". Van Tassel claimed it was made of non-ferromagnetic materials: wood, concrete, glass, and fibreglass, lacking even metal screws or nails. The Integratron was never fully completed due to Van Tassel's sudden death a few weeks before the official opening. In recent times some people who visit the unfinished Integratron claim to be rejuvenated by staying there, and experiencing \"sound baths\" inside.\n\nVan Tassel was a classic 1950s contactee in the mold of George Adamski, Truman Bethurum, Orfeo Angelucci and many others. He hosted \"The Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention\" annually beside the Rock, from 1953 to 1978, which attracted at its peak in 1959 as many as 10,000 attendees. Guests trekked to the desert by car or landed airplanes on Van Tassel's small airstrip, called Giant Rock Airport.\n\nEvery famous contactee appeared personally at these conventions over the years, and many more not-so-famous ones. References often state that the first and most famous contactee, George Adamski, pointedly boycotted these conventions. In fact, however, Adamski attended the third convention, held in 1955, where he gave a 35-minute lecture and was interviewed by Edward J. Ruppelt, once head of the Air Force \"Project Blue Book\". It was the only such convention Adamski attended.\n\nVan Tassel founded a metaphysics research organization called The Ministry of Universal Wisdom, and The College of Universal Wisdom to codify the spiritual revelations he was now regularly receiving via communications with the people from Space.\n\nVan Tassel's book, \"I Rode A Flying Saucer\" (1952, 1955), recounts his claims of receiving \"cosmic wisdom\" \"Solgonda\" and a large number of other people from space. Among his other works are \"Into This World and Out Again\" (1956), \"The Council of Seven Lights\" (1958), \"Religion and Science Merged\", and \"When Stars Look Down\".\n\n\n\n"}

He subsequently studied law and journalism at Ghent University.\n\nMortier pursued apprenticeships in opera administration under Christoph von Dohnányi in Frankfurt and Rolf Liebermann in Paris. He worked for the Flanders Festival from 1968 to 1972. His first major administrative post was as the general director of La Monnaie (De Munt) in Brussels from 1981 to 1991, where he was credited with artistically rejuvenating the company. He subsequently held the general directorship of the Salzburg Festival from 1991 to 2001.\n\nMortier was the founding director of the Ruhrtriennale arts festival in Germany, leading it from 2002 to 2004. He was inspired to \"a social and artistic experiment: how to attract new audiences to the classics and galvanize a depressed corner of Germany.\" At the same time, he was able to work his own interests in flouting tradition and attracting new audiences to the Ruhr. He put intimate productions into expansive, renovated industrial spaces. In 2003, he offered an ambitious season of\n\n23 productions with 129 performances in 15 spaces, along with additional concerts, a fringe festival and what promises to be an astonishing installation of a Bill Viola video spectacle, \"Five Angels for the Millennium,\" inside a mighty, gorgeously restored gas tank in Oberhausen.\nPlanned was a production of Messiaen's \"Saint François d'Assise\" in September 2003. Mortier had a \"current of spirituality meant to infuse these cathedrals of industry\", and emphasized a French subtext in 2003, compared to a German one the year before. He had \"faith that audiences will eventually respond to the experimentation by him and his successors.\"\n\nMortier served as general director of the Opéra National de Paris from 2004 to 2009.\n\nIn February 2007, the New York City Opera (NYCO) named him their next general director, effective as of the 2009/2010 season. Mortier assisted with company operations from Paris during the interim period after his appointment was announced. Problems with fund-raising and a smaller-than-expected budget began to develop during the interim period after his appointment. In addition, Mortier was campaigning for a position as co-artistic director of the Bayreuth Festival. In November 2008, by mutual agreement, Mortier and the NYCO agreed to terminate their contract.\n\nAlso in November 2008, Mortier accepted the position of Artistic Director of the Teatro Real in Madrid. While in New York, he had already commissioned a new opera, \"Brokeback Mountain\", with the American composer Charles Wuorinen and a libretto by Annie Proulx, who wrote the original short story on which it is based. This was one of the projects Mortier took with him to the Teatro Real, and it was completed in 2012.\n\nIn September 2013, Mortier disclosed publicly his condition of cancer. During the search for his successor, he made controversial comments that he did not know of a fully qualified Spanish candidate to succeed him, and mentioned concerns about the expressed government interference in the choice of successor and their wish to have only a Spanish candidate succeed him. Later that month, following the appointment of Joan Matabosch as the company next's artistic director, Mortier was named artistic advisor of the company. On January 28, 2014, \"Brokeback Mountain\" premiered in Madrid. The production had been highly anticipated in the international season, and it was considered also a tribute to Mortier, \"and a testament to his tireless support of the artists who work with him.\"\n\nMortier died of pancreatic cancer in Brussels on 8 March 2014, aged 70. Survivors include his sister Rita and his longtime companion, conductor Sylvain Cambreling.

He studied at a Dutch elementary school, then went to high school in Malang, East Java. He then received Dutch military training at the Military Cadet School in Gianyar, Bali and Magelang, Central Java. After graduating, he joined the Dutch-sponsored military as a second lieutenant in Bali.\n\nAfter the Indonesian Declaration of Independence he established the People's Security Army, the forerunner of the military of Indonesia, for the Lesser Sunda Islands. He then left for the republican capital, Yogyakarta to receive orders before returning to Bali to oppose the approximately 2,000 Dutch troops who had landed on 2 and 3 March 1946.\n\nNgurah Rai found that the republican forces were divided and he worked hard to reunite them. He then organized the first attack against the Dutch forces headquarters at Tabanan. The Dutch then attempted to locate Nguraha Rai's base and offered negotiations, which he refused.\n\nOn 20 November 1946, the Dutch launched a large attack on Marga with the assistance of troops from Lombok and supported by aircraft. Lt. Col Ngurah Rai ordered a Puputan, or fight to the death. He died along with all of his troops. The battle is now known as the Battle of Margarana.However, because Ngurah Rai's entire force was wiped out, including the military leadership, the Dutch forces were subsequently unopposed and were able to regain control of Bali. This may not have been possible had Ngurah Rai adopted a guerrilla strategy.\n\nNgurah Rai was buried in Marga. On 9 August 1975, he was made a national hero via Presidential Decision No. 063/TK/TH 1975. Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali is named for him and he appears on the IDR50,000 note.\n\n"}

According to the ancient Hindu law, the Kshatriyas are alone having the rights to bear arms in order to defend the country. Indigenous Kshatriya communities currently exist in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam as well as in the island of Bali in Indonesia.\n\nMost prominent of the Kshatriya clans in Java were those located in \"Koripan, Gaglang, Kediri and Janggala\". The literary work \"Rangga Lawe\" describes in detail about the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas of the Kediri royal palace. Jawa or Kediri was the largest Hindu kingdom, which was ruled by Kshatriyas in the island.\n\nJavanese Kshatriyas were popularly known as \"K'bo\" or \"Mahisa\" (meaning buffalo) and \"Rangga\" to indicate their strength. The Kshatriyas came to Java in small numbers, but most of the princes were of the third caste, the wesya (Vaishya). Most important of the Kshatriya families in Java were \"Mahisa Bungalan, K'bo Wilalungan, K'bo Siluman, K'bo Jerang, K'bo Kanigara, K'bo Chaluk, K'bo T'ki, K'bo Taluktak, Ki Mahisa Safati, K'bo Mundarang, and further Rangga Smi, Rangga Mayang, Rangga Palana, Rangga Ralengsong, Rangga Pasung, Rangga Wirada, Rangga Rabete, Rangga Sumbi, Rangga Sampana, and Anurangga Sunting\". Some of these Kshatriya clans migrated to the island of Bali as well. The royal family of Deva Agung, who is considered to be the ancestor of almost all the Kshatriyas in Bali, was originally a Kshatriya from Java. \n\nThe Javanese Kshatriyas became extinct during the early 17th century as a result of constant warfare with their Islamic rivals. No descendants remain of this community now, except those in Bali who claim ancestry from Dewa Agung.\n"}

Thomas has been vice president of the Royal Anthropological Institute since 2007, is a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, has been professor of archaeology at the University of Manchester since 2000, and is former secretary of the World Archaeological Congress. Thomas is perhaps best known as the author of the academic publication \"Understanding the Neolithic\" in particular, and for his work with the Stonehenge Riverside Project.\n\nBorn in Epsom, Surrey, Thomas studied archaeology at the University of Bradford, where he acquired a BTech in archaeological science in 1981, before transferring to the University of Sheffield and achieving an MA (in 1982), and a PhD (in 1986), for his research on the \"social and economic change in the Neolithic of Wessex and the Upper Thames valley\".\n\nBetween 1987 and 2000 Thomas was a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Wales, Lampeter (1987–1993) and at Southampton University (1994–2000). Thomas worked with Historic Scotland between 1994 and 2002, excavating prehistoric sites in Dumfries and Galloway as \"Director of archaeological excavations of Neolithic and later prehistoric sites\" – the record of which was published as \"Place and Memory: Excavations at the Pict's Knowe, Holywood and Holm Farm\" in 2007.\n\nOriginally published as \"Rethinking the Neolithic\" in 1991, Thomas revised his work, which was republished as \"Understanding the Neolithic\" in 1999. The book challenged the conventionally held view that human lifestyles transformed in Great Britain, from Mesolithic hunter-gatherers to Neolithic farmers – a process known as the \"Neolithic Revolution\"– through interpretive analysis of \"social theory, anthropology and critical hermeneutics\".\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999 Thomas was secretary of the World Archaeological Congress and became academic series editor (a \"pro bono\" (unpaid) position held jointly with Martin Hall) of the Routledge series \"Themes in Archaeology\" – which moved to Left Coast Press as the \"One World Archaeology Series\" in 2008. Ten books in the series were published during their tenure – between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThomas took up the Chair of Archaeology at Manchester University in April 2000, a position he still holds.\n\nThomas is co-director of the Stonehenge Riverside Project – a collaborative archaeological study begun in 2003 as a consortium of university teams, funded by the AHRC and the National Geographic Society. During excavations of sites surrounding Stonehenge – including Stonehenge Cursus, the Avenue and Woodhenge – Thomas found evidence of a large settlement of Neolithic houses, at Durrington Walls, nearby and discovered the prehistoric henge and stone circle, known as \"Bluestonehenge\", on the west bank of the Avon. Thomas speculates that the 25 bluestones at Stonehenge – originating in the Preseli Hills, away in modern-day Pembrokeshire, Wales – stood in a circle, surrounded by a henge, at Bluestonehenge for around 500 years before being dismantled and moved to their current location around 2500 BCE.\n\nThomas has been Vice President of the Royal Anthropological Institute since his election in 2007 and is a of the Society of Antiquaries of London (also since 2007).\n\nThomas is married to Catherine, and has two daughters – Morag and Rowan and two step-daughters Lucie and Anna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They have close ties to the Lun Bawang. The elevation there is slightly over 1,200 meters. In the past, because there were few roads (only poorly maintained logging roads, which tended not to be too close to the Bario Highlands) and because the area was largely inaccessible by river because of rapids, the highlands and the Kelabit were relatively untouched by modern western influences. Now, however, there is a relatively permanent road route on which it is possible to reach Bario by car from Miri. The road is marked but driving without a local guide is not advisable, as it takes over 11 hours of driving to reach Bario from Miri through many logging trail junctions and river crossings.\n\nWith a population of approximately 6,600 people (2013) the Kelabit comprise one of the smallest ethnic groups in Sarawak. Many have migrated to urban areas over the last 20 years and it is estimated that only 1,200 still live in their remote homeland. There, tightly knit communities live in inherited longhouses and practice a generations-old form of agriculture. Hunting and fishing is also practised. Domesticated buffalo are valued highly, seven of which are traditionally required for the dowry for an upper class bride.\n\nThe name of the people comes from the local word, \"na labid\"; where the name of people originated from the name of Labid River. Also, other people group names such as Lun Bawang, Lun Dayeh or Southern Muruts are often associated with the Kelabit people. The Kelabit people belong to the Dayak people (it is a large ethnic group of closely related people groups that includes about 200 tribes). With a population of approximately 6,600, the Kelabit people are the smallest people group in the state of Sarawak.\n\nDuring the Second World War the Kelabit, like other natives of Borneo, were co-opted by the Allies into fighting the Japanese. The English academic Tom Harrisson led the Semut I operations (one of four Semut operations in the area), which parachuted into their midst in 1945 to make contact; they were supplied with weapons by the Australian military and played an essential role in the liberation of Borneo.\n\nAfter the Second World War the Kelabit people received visits from Christian missionaries of the Borneo Evangelical Mission. The Kelabit are now predominantly Christian. Prior to conversion they had a custom of erecting megaliths and digging ditches in honour of notable individuals. As the Kelabit people began to Christianize in the early 20th century, so did the process of ethnic consolidation were also intensified.\n\nThe Kelabit people uses Latin script that were introduced to the island by the colonialist from Europe. The Kelabit language belongs to the North Bornean branch of the Western Malayo-Polynesian languages. The Kelabit language is used in one of the most remote areas of the Borneo island in the Bario highlands of Kalimantan and northern Sarawak. There are several dialects in the Kelabitic languages such as Lepu Potng, Padas, Trusan and so on.\n\nThere is a strict order (rule) of inheritance, which includes the need for one person to organize expensive commemorative celebrations (perhaps, a wake) for people who inherit from them. The conflict between older brothers and sisters can be particularly noticeable in connection with these circumstances. In any case, the Kelabit family is a cooperating unit.\n\nAdults are called \"lun merar\", which literally means \"big people\". In order to attain adulthood, one must have three things:-\n\nIn rural communities there is a division of castes namely, the nobility, the ordinary community members and the descendants of those who were in slavery. The leader always comes from the nobility. He must have things that are regarded as special prestige among the Kelabit people. These are ancient items of Chinese origin such as, porcelain vases, beads or gongs, as well as items that are made from pearls.\n\nKelabit villages usually include only one longhouse, in which all the inhabitants of the community would live in. A longhouse can stretch as long as 75 meters in length. Such house does not have partitions that divides into rooms.\n\nIn traditional society, men wear traditional loincloths, and the women would wear skirt made of Tapa cloth (material from the inside of the tree bark). Some would prefer Westernized clothing. The custom of tattooing and dulling of teeth have also become less pervalent.\n\nRice, for the Kelabit people, symbolizes the true human food. Kelabit people mainly eat rice, and also additionally meat, fruits, vegetables, corn and sugar cane. Traditional Kelabit cuisine are such as:-\n\n\nPottery, blacksmithing and wood carving are all traditional crafts of Kelabit people. The form of the stone adze (chopping tools) of the Kelabit differs noticeably from the types previously recorded in Southeast Asia; where its 'quadrangular' is from Malaysia, and there is no 'round ax'. Also traditional occupation of the Kelabit people includes needle-working. There are 69 items with pearls (necklaces, hats and belts) decorations. Pearl jewelry is a sign of prestige, just like Chinese porcelain vases. Necklaces are worn by both men and women, while headdresses are exclusively for women. Kelabit people are interested in precious stones. Earlier before they became Christians, Kelabit people had stone amulets. Agriculture is a traditional occupation of the Kelabit people.\n\nThe traditional occupation of Kelabit people is agriculture. The main cultivar is rice. They distinguish between wet paddy field and dried paddy field. In the north of the Bario Highlands, there are only wet paddy field areas. In other parts of the Highlands, dried paddy field areas have also been made, as well as other crops that have also been planted in these paddy field areas. The Kelabit people are also cultivators of maize, tapioca, pineapple, pumpkin, cucumber, beans, coffee, lemon grass, taro and various fruit like passion fruit and strawberry. Livestock development is limited. Meat is a special problem, as traditionally the Kelabit people used it only for sacrifices, and even today almost no animals are slaughtered for daily consumption (since, at present, there are still many Kelabit people who are adherents of traditional beliefs). Subsequently, they began to raise animals for dairy products and meat. The forest is the main source of wild fruits and vegetables. Forest gathering, hunting and fishing are common. Kelabit people engages in salt extraction; which plays a significant role in their economy. With salt, they would exchange from other people for their own necessities.\n\n\n\n"}

Her father, James Achilles Kirkpatrick, was a British Resident in Hyderabad and a colonel in the British East India Company's army. Her mother, Khair-un-Nissa, was a Hyderabadi [ noblewoman and a \"Sayyida\", a lineal descendant of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, whose grandfather was the prime minister of Hyderabad. The two had met in the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad, and were married in a Muslim ceremony. James Kirkpatrick, a Christian, underwent some degree of conversion to Islam to be permitted to marry Khair-un-Nissa, but is not clear whether the marriage or the conversion were recognized as legal.\n\nKitty was initially named Noor un-Nissa, Sahib Begum (\"Little Lady of High Lineage\") and was raised alongside her brother William (known as Mir Ghulam Ali, Sahib Allum) in the mansion her father built, the British Residency, Hyderabad, living in the zenana with her mother and grandmother. James was a doting father and is known to have spent a lot of time with his wife and small children. In 1805, Kitty and William were sent to live in England at age three and five years, respectively, with their paternal grandfather, Colonel James Kirkpatrick. At the time, it was common for British families in India to send their young children to Europe as death rates for children in India were frighteningly high, and families wanted them to grow up as British, speaking unaccented English and being educated at a British school or by British tutors in a British home, before returning. The well-known painter, George Chinnery, created a portrait of the siblings in Madras, shortly before they were sent to England. The two children were baptised as Christians on 25 March 1805, at St Mary's Church, Marylebone Road in London, and were thereafter known by their new Christian names, William George Kirkpatrick and Katherine Aurora \"Kitty\" Kirkpatrick. They never again saw India or any members of their maternal family.\n\nJames Kirkpatrick died on 15 October 1805, around 8 months after Kitty and William had left India. In his will, James describes William and Kitty as his \"natural children,\" leaving large fortunes to each, and left money to his nieces and nephews, the children of his brother William Kirkpatrick, who he was deeply indebted to for launching his lucrative career with the East India Company. William Kirkpatrick, who had needed to retire to England mid-career due to poor health, had arranged for James to step into his prestigious and lucrative position as Resident at Hyderabad. James used his fortune to support William Kirkpatrick and his children out of his love for and gratitude toward his elder brother. Following James' death and the absence of her children, Khair-un-Nissa, who had lived in strict \"purdah\" during his lifetime, began a relationship with Henry Russell, one of James' assistants. Only 19 years-old at the time, Khair-un-Nissa was abandoned by Russell, destroying her reputation among the Hyderabadi elite and was forced into exile, unable to prevent greedy relatives from taking over the valuable landed estates she had inherited from her father.\n\nKitty and her brother William had substantial sums settled on them by their mother, which allowed for them to be raised and educated in middle-class comfort in England. Kitty was educated privately and brought up to emulate the ideal of the Christian lady. In 1812, William suffered a severe burn injury resulted in the amputation of one of his arms, and became reclusive thereafter, though he successfully graduated from Oxford University in 1820, married, and had three daughters before his early death in 1828. Her brother's death, as well as that of her grandfather and other relations, left Kitty with a substantial inheritance estimated at about £50,000. After the death of her grandfather, Kirkpatrick lived with various of her married cousins: Clementina, Lady Louis; Julia, the wife of Edward Strachey; and (Barbara) Isabella, the wife of Charles Buller, a Member of Parliament and mother of Charles Buller junior.\n\nInto adulthood Kitty became known for her attractiveness, and in 1822, while staying with the Bullers, she met the Scottish philosopher and historian, Thomas Carlyle, who was then employed as the Buller children's tutor and who swiftly became infatuated with Kirkpatrick. The romance was encouraged by another of Kitty's cousins, Julia (who married Edward Strachey, grandfather of the writer Lytton Strachey). However, Carlyle was impoverished and not believed by the rest of the family to be a suitable match for the wealthy and well-connected Kitty. Carlyle would later use Kitty as the basis for the Calypso-like Blumine in his novel \"Sartor Resartus\" and his memoirs, written many decades later, wrote a pen portrait of Kitty admiring her beauty but is clearly suspicious of her mixed-race ancestry:\n\nOn 21 November 1829, Kitty married James Winslowe Phillipps (1802-1859), an army officer in the 7th Hussars Regiment, and a member of the Kennaway family, which also had Indian connections. It was evidently a happy marriage, Kirkpatrick and Phillipps went on to have seven children, of whom four survived to adulthood: Mary Augusta (1830-1909), John James (b. 1834), Emily Georgina (b. 1835), and Bertha Elizabeth (1840-1875).\n\nKirkpatrick's paternal family had long forbidden her from maintaining any contact with her family in India. However, with the help of Henry Russell, her father's former assistant and her mother's ex-lover, Kirkpatrick was able to re-establish contact with her maternal grandmother after almost four decades of separation. Although they were never physically re-united, the two women were correspondents on a regular and often emotional basis for six years. \n\nKirkpatrick's letters make it clear that despite leaving India and her mother at such a young age, she still retained vivid memories of it:\n\nKirkpatrick died at her home, the Villa Sorrento, in Torquay, Devon, in 1889.\n\n"}

His brothers were also a poet Antonio Machado and José Machado.\nInherited his father's love of popular Andalusian character. Born in San Pedro Martir Street No. 20, his childhood was spent in the Palacio de las Dueñas, where his family had rented one of the zones reserved for individuals. When Manuel was 9, the whole family moved to Madrid, because the paternal grandfather had obtained a professorship at the Universidad Central. The desire of all the three brothers was studying in the Free Institution of Teaching, led by Francisco Giner de los Ríos, a great friend of the grandfather Manuel.\n\nThe family moved to Madrid, where he developed his studies, culminating with a Bachelor of Arts. Since then, his family returned to Seville in few occasions, but Seville and Andalusia remained for him a living reference, though distant, for the love of his parents towards their land.\n\nIn Madrid, Manuel began to publicize his first poetry and contributed to several literary life in Madrid along with writers like Francis and Juan Ramón Jiménez Villaespesa.\n\nHe was co-founder, on February 11, 1933 of the Association of Friends of the Soviet Union.\n\nOver the years, he became director of Madrid's Municipal Library (now the Municipal Historical Library) and Municipal Museum. He created several short-lived literary magazines and worked in daily newspapers in Europe and America.\n\nContributed strongly to the modernist poetry, understood in its most colorful, decadent, cosmopolitan, giving a hint of Andalusian poetry makes something unique.\n\nIt has often been opposed to the modernist side of the 98 Generation.\n\nIn 1936-during the civil war, was appointed to a seat in the Royal Spanish Academy.\n\nBrothers Manuel and Antonio wrote together several dramatic works of Andalusian. Manuel's most notable work is \"La Lola se va a los puertos\", filmed twice.\n\nOther dramatic works of Machado were the \"La duquesa de Benamejí\", \"La prima Fernanda\", \"Juan de Mañara\", \"El hombre que murió en la guerra\" and \"Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valcárcel\".\n\nAlthough the poetry of both is very different, we can see certain parallels. Thus, both paths composed autobiographical poems (\"Adelfos\" Manuel, and \"Portrait\", by Antonio) using Alexandrine verses organized in serventesios. The civil war separated the brothers, placing them on opposite sides.\n\nUpon arrival in Madrid after the Spanish coup of July 1936, Manuel gave the military an encomiastic poetry, \"The sword of the Caudillo.\" This earned him the recognition of the Nationalists. After the war he returned to his post as director of the Newspaper Library and the Municipal Museum of Madrid, who retired shortly thereafter. He continued to write poetry, mostly religious in nature. His Catholic faith was rekindled during your stay in Burgos thanks to the devotion of his wife and the influence of certain priests, as Bonifacio Zamora. The poet continued to write eulogies to various figures and symbols of Francoist Spain, which earned him the scorn of critics and later poets, who considered him a traitor to the Spanish Second Republic.\n\nOn January 19, 1947 died in Madrid. After the poet's death, his widow entered a religious order dedicated to caring for abandoned and sick children.\n\nThen came the Spanish openness of the 60 and 70, Francisco Franco gave the youth side to the poets covered by Spain and embraced those who died, or still living-in-exile.

{"id": "320529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320529", "title": "Reynard the Fox", "text": "Reynard the Fox\n\nReynard the Fox is a literary cycle of medieval allegorical Dutch, English, French and German fables. The first extant versions of the cycle date to the second half of the 12th century. The genre is very popular throughout the Late Middle Ages, and in chapbook form throughout the Early Modern period.\n\nThe stories are largely concerned with the main character Reynard (; ; ; ), an anthropomorphic red fox and trickster figure. His adventures usually involve him deceiving other anthropomorphic animals for his own advantage or trying to avoid retaliations from them. His main enemy and victim across the cycle is his uncle, the wolf Isengrim (or Ysengrim). \n\nWhile the character of Reynard appears in later works, the core stories were written during the Middle Ages by multiple authors and are often seen as parodies of medieval literature such as courtly love stories and chansons de geste, as well as a satire of political and religious institutions.\n\nThe main characters are anthropomorphic animals. The given names of the animals are Old High German in origin, most of them were in common use as personal names in medieval Lorraine.\n\n\nThe figure of Reynard is thought to have originated in Lorraine folklore from where it spread to France, the Low Countries, and Germany. An extensive treatment of the character is the Old French \"Le Roman de Renart\" written by Pierre de Saint-Cloud around 1170, which sets the typical setting. Reynard has been summoned to the court of king Noble, or Leo, the lion, to answer charges brought against him by Isengrim the wolf. Other anthropomorphic animals, including Bruin the bear, Baldwin the ass, and Tibert (Tybalt) the cat, all attempt one stratagem or another. The stories typically involve satire whose usual butts are the aristocracy and the clergy, making Reynard a peasant-hero character. The story of the preaching fox found in the Reynard literature was used in church art by the Catholic Church as propaganda against the Lollards. Reynard's principal castle, Maupertuis, is available to him whenever he needs to hide away from his enemies. Some of the tales feature Reynard's funeral, where his enemies gather to deliver maudlin elegies full of insincere piety, and which feature Reynard's posthumous revenge. Reynard's wife Hermeline appears in the stories, but plays little active role, although in some versions she remarries when Reynard is thought dead, thereby becoming one of the people he plans revenge upon. Isengrim (alternate French spelling: \"Ysengrin\") is Reynard's most frequent antagonist and foil, and generally ends up outwitted, though he occasionally gets revenge.\n\nReynard appears first in the medieval Latin poem \"Ysengrimus\", a long Latin mock-epic written c. 1148–1153 by the poet Nivardus in Ghent, that collects a great store of Reynard's adventures. He also puts in an early appearance in a number of Latin sequences by the preacher Odo of Cheriton. Both of these early sources seem to draw on a pre-existing store of popular culture featuring the character.\n\nThe first \"branch\" (or chapter) of the \"Roman de Renart\" appears in 1174, written by Pierre de St. Cloud, although in all French editions it is designated as \"Branch II\". The same author wrote a sequel in 1179—called \"Branch I\"—but from that date onwards, many other French authors composed their own adventures for Renart \"li goupil\" (\"the fox\"). There is also the text \"Reinhard Fuchs\" by Heinrich der Glïchezäre, dated to 1180.\n\nPierre de St. Cloud opens his work on the fox by situating it within the larger tradition of epic poetry, the fabliaux and Arthurian romance:\n\nA mid-13th-century Middle Dutch version of the story by Willem die Madoc maecte (\"Van den vos Reynaerde\", Of Reynaert the Fox), is also made up of rhymed verses (the same AA BB scheme). Like Pierre, very little is known of the author, other than the description by the copyist in the first sentences:\n\"Madocke\" or \"Madoc\" is thought to be another one of Willem's works that at one point existed but was lost. The \"Arnout\" mentioned was an earlier Reynard poet whose work Willem (the writer) alleges to have finished. However, there are serious objections to this notion of joint authorship, and the only thing deemed likely is that Arnout was French-speaking (\"Walschen\" in Middle Dutch referred to northern French-speaking people, specifically the Walloons). Willem's work became one of the standard versions of the legend, and was the foundation for most later adaptations in Dutch, German, and English, including those of William Caxton, Goethe, and F. S. Ellis.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer used Reynard material in the \"Canterbury Tales\"; in \"The Nun's Priest's Tale\", Reynard appears as \"Rossel\" and an ass as \"Brunel\".\n\nIn 1481 William Caxton printed \"The Historie of Reynart the Foxe\", which was translated from \"Van den vos Reynaerde\". Also in the 1480s, the Scottish poet Robert Henryson devised a highly sophisticated development of Reynardian material as part of his \"Morall Fabillis\" in the sections known as \"The Talking of the Tod\". Hans van Ghetelen, a printer of Incunabula in Lübeck printed an early German version called \"Reinke de Vos\" in 1498. It was translated to Latin and other languages, which made the tale popular across Europe. Reynard is also referenced in the Middle English poem \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" during the third hunt.\n\nTybalt in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" is named after the cat in Reynard the Fox (and is called 'Prince of Cats' by Mercutio in reference to this).\nJonson's play \"Volpone\" is heavily indebted to Reynard.\n\n\"Reinecke Fuchs\" by Goethe is a poem in hexameters, in twelve parts, written 1793 and first published 1794.\nGoethe adapted the Reynard material from the edition by Johann Christoph Gottsched (1752), based on the 1498 \"Reynke de vos\".\n\nIn Friedrich Nietzsche's \"The Twilight of the Idols\", Nietzsche uses Reynard the Fox as an example of a dialectician.\n\nGerman artist Johann Heinrich Ramberg made a series of 30 drawings which he also etched and published in 1825.\n\n\"Renert\" [full original title: \"Renert oder de Fuuß am Frack an a Ma'nsgrëßt\"], was published in 1872 by Michel Rodange, a Luxembourgeois author.\n\nAn epic satirical work—adapted from the 1858 Cotta Edition of Goethe's fox epic \"Reineke Fuchs\" to a setting in Luxembourg— it is known for its insightful analysis of the unique characteristics of the people of Luxembourg, using regional and sub-regional dialects to depict the fox and his companions.\n\nFedor Flinzer illustrated \"Reineke Fuchs\" (\"Reynard the Fox\") for children.\n\nFrench artist Rémy Lejeune (Ladoré) illustrated \"Les Aventures de Maître Renart et d'Ysengrin son compère\", \"Bibliolâtres de France\" editions (1960)\n\n\n\"Van den vos Reynaerde\" (Of Reynaert the Fox) was an anti-Semitic children's story, written by the Dutch-Belgian Robert van Genechten, and named after the Middle Dutch poem. It was first published in 1937 in \"Nieuw-Nederland\", a monthly publication of the Dutch Nazi Party's front, the NSB. In 1941 it was published as a book.\n\nThe story features a rhinoceros called Jodocus, somewhat akin to the Dutch word \"jood\" (\"jew\"); and a donkey, Boudewijn, who occupies the throne. \"Boudewijn\" was the Dutch name for the contemporary real-world Belgian crown prince. \nIn the story, Jodocus is an outsider who comes to the Empire and subsequently introduces new ideas that drastically alter the natural order. The land is then declared a \"Republic\", where \"liberty, equality and fraternity\" are to be exercised, presenting a dystopian view of a socialist republic: \"There was no one who kept to the rules of the race. Rabbits crept into foxholes, the chickens wanted to build an eyrie.\" \nEventually, Reynard and the others trick and kill Jodocus and his colleagues.\n\n\"Van den vos Reynaerde\" was also produced as a cartoon film by Nederlandfilm in 1943, mostly financed with German money. \nWhile lavishly budgeted, it was never presented publicly, possibly because most Dutch Jews had already been transported to the concentration camps and the film came too late to be useful as a propaganda piece, possibly also because the Dutch collaborationist Department of People's Information, Service and Arts objected to the fact that the fox, an animal traditionally seen as \"villainous\", should be used as a hero. \nIn 1991, parts of the film were discovered in the German \"Bundesarchiv\". In 2005, more pieces were found, and the film has been restored. The reconstructed film was shown during the 2006 Holland Animation Film Festival in Utrecht and during the KLIK! Amsterdam Animation Festival in 2008, in the Netherlands.\n\nLadislas Starevich's 1930 puppet-animated feature film \"Le Roman de Renard\" (The Tale of the Fox) featured the Reynard character as the protagonist.\nThe documentary film \"\" (1962) parallels Hitler's rise to power with the Reynard fable.\n\nInitially, Walt Disney Animation Studios considered a movie about Reynard. However, due to Walt Disney's concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero, the studio decided to make Reynard the antagonist of a single narrative feature film named \"Chanticleer and Reynard\" (based on Edmond Rostand's \"Chanticleer\") but the production was scrapped in the mid-1960s, in favor of \"The Sword in the Stone\" (1963). Ken Anderson used the character designs for \"Robin Hood\" (1973) such as the animal counterparts (e.g. Robin Hood like Reynard is a fox while the Sheriff of Nottingham like Isengrim is a wolf).\n\nIn 1985, a French animated series, \"\" (\"I Reynard\"), was created that was loosely based on Reynard's tales. In it, the original animals are anthropomorphic humanoid animals (to the point that, primary, only their heads are that of animals) and the action occurs in modern Paris with other anthropomorphic animals in human roles. Reynard is a young mischievous fox with a little monkey pet called Marmouset (an original creation). He sets off into Paris in order to discover the city, get a job and visit his grumpy and stingy uncle, Isengrim, who is a deluxe car salesman, and his reasonable yet dreamy she-wolf aunt, Hersent. Reynard meets Hermeline, a young and charming motorbike-riding vixen journalist. He immediately falls in love with her and tries to win her heart during several of the episodes. As Reynard establishes himself in Paris, he creates a small company that shares his name which offers to do any job for anyone, from impersonating female maids to opera singers. To help with this, he is a master of disguise and is a bit of a kleptomaniac, which gets him into trouble from police chief Chantecler (a rooster) who often sends cat police inspector Tybalt after him to thwart his plans.\n\n\"Le roman de Renart\" is a 2005 CGI feature animated film made in Luxembourg in French with an English dub called \"Renart The Fox\" or \"The Adventures of Renny the Fox\"\n\nThe TV show \"The Magicians\" includes a character based on Reynard. In this version, he is a violent pagan trickster god accidentally summoned by a group of hedge witches. He ends up killing most of the summoners and taking over the body of their leader.\n\nReynard the Fox is the name of a number of traditional folk songs (Roud 190, 358 and 1868).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "874192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=874192", "title": "Rāhula", "text": "Rāhula\n\nRāhula (Pāli and Sanskrit) was the only son of Siddhārtha Gautama (commonly known as the Buddha) ( ), and his wife and princess Yaśodharā. He is mentioned in numerous Buddhist texts, from the early period onward. Accounts about Rāhula indicate a mutual impact between Prince Siddhārtha's life and those of his family members. According to the Pāli tradition, Rāhula is born on the day of Prince Siddhārta's renunciation, and is therefore named \"Rāhula\", meaning a fetter on the path to enlightenment. According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, and numerous other later sources, however, Rāhula is only \"conceived\" on the day of Prince Siddhārtha, and is born six years later, when Prince Siddhārtha becomes enlightened as the Buddha. This long gestation period is explained by bad karma from previous lives of both Yaśodharā and of Rāhula himself, although more naturalistic reasons are also given. As a result of the late birth, Yaśodharā needs to prove that Rāhula is really Prince Siddhārtha's son, which she eventually does successfully by an act of truth. Historian has argued that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula and waited for his birth, to be able to leave the palace with the king and queen's permission, but Orientalist considered it more likely that Rāhula was born after Prince Siddhārtha left his palace.\n\nBetween seven and fifteen years after Rāhula is born, the Buddha returns to his hometown, where Yaśodharā has Rāhula ask the Buddha for the throne of the Śākya clan. The Buddha responds by having Rāhula ordain as the first Buddhist novice monk. He teaches the young novice about truth, self-reflection, and not-self, eventually leading to Rāhula's enlightenment. Although early accounts state that Rāhula dies before the Buddha does, later tradition has it that Rāhula is one of the disciples that outlives the Buddha, guarding the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of the next Buddha. Rāhula is known in Buddhist texts for his eagerness for learning, and was honored by novice monks and nuns throughout Buddhist history. His accounts have led to a perspective in Buddhism of seeing children as hindrances to the spiritual life on the one hand, and as people with potential for enlightenment on the other hand.\n\nSome early texts such as those of the Pāli tradition do not mention Rāhula at all; but he is mentioned in later Pāli texts such as the Apadāna and the commentaries, as well as in the texts on monastic discipline of the Mūlasarvāstivāda and Mahāsaṇghika traditions. Earliest texts do not describe Rāhula in much detail, and he remains an ideal figure without much depth in character. Because of the lack of detail, especially after Rāhula's ordination, some scholars have argued Rāhula did not have an important role in Buddhism. Apart from the early texts, there are many post-canonical Buddhist texts that contain accounts about Rāhula. The accounts about Rāhula reveal that when Prince Siddhārtha leaves his palace to become a monk, his decision and subsequent spiritual quest is not just a personal matter, but also affects his family every step during the way, as they respond to and affect the prince on his path to enlightenment. Thus, the prince's life before enlightenment is about two parallel spiritual lives, that of the Buddha and that of his family.\n\nRāhula is born on same day Prince Siddhārtha Gautama renounces the throne by leaving the palace, when the prince is 29 years old, on the full moon day of the eight lunar month of the ancient Indian calendar. That day, Prince Siddhārtha is preparing himself to leave the palace. The Pāli account claims that when he receives the news of his son's birth he replies \"\", meaning 'A \"rāhu\" is born, a fetter has arisen', that is, an impediment to the search for enlightenment. Accordingly, Śuddhodana, Prince Siddhārtha's father and king of the Śākya clan, names the child \"Rāhula\", because he does not want his son to pursue a spiritual life as a mendicant. In some versions, Prince Siddhārtha is the one naming his son this way, for being a hindrance on his spiritual path. Just before the prince leaves the palace for the spiritual life, he takes one look at his wife Yaśodharā and his just-born child. Fearing his resolve might waver, Prince Siddhārtha resists to hold his son and leaves the palace as he has planned. Rāhula therefore becomes Prince Siddhārtha's first, but also last and only son.\n\nOther texts derive \"rāhu\" differently. For example, the Pāli \"Apadāna\", as well as another account found in the texts of monastic discipline of the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, derive \"rāhu\" from the eclipse of the moon, which traditionally was seen to be caused by the asura (demon) Rāhu. The \"Apadāna\" states that just like the moon is obstructed from view by Rāhu, Prince Siddhārtha is obstructed by Rāhula's birth. The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition relates, however, that Rāhula is conceived on the evening of the renunciation of Prince Siddhārtha, and born six years later, on the day that his father achieves enlightenment, which was during a lunar eclipse. Further credence is given to the astrological theory of Rāhula's name by the observation that sons of previous Buddhas are given similar names, related to constellations.\n\nMūlasarvāstivāda and later Chinese texts such as the \"Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra\" give two types of explanation for the long gestation period. The first type involves the karma of Princess Yaśodharā and Rāhula himself. According to this interpretation, Yaśodharā has to bear the suffering of carrying a child in her womb for six years, because in a previous life as a cow herder she had refused to help her mother to carry a pail of milk and left it for her mother to carry the extra pail for six leagues. As for Rāhula, his karma was that in a previous life as a king he unintentionally had a sage wait for six days. In this life, he was a king and his brother, a previous life of the Buddha, was a hermit who had taken a vow he would only live from what was given by people. One day, the brother broke his vow to take some water, and feeling guilty, asked the king to punish him. The king refused to issue a punishment for such a trivial matter, but had his brother wait for his final decision and constrained in the royal gardens. After six days, the king suddenly realized he had forgotten about the hermit and immediately set him free, including apologies and gifts. As a result, Rāhula had to wait for six years before being born. In some versions, the king did not allow a sage to enter his kingdom and accumulated the same bad karma of a long gestation period. The later Mahāyāna commentary \"Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa\" () does not blame Yaśodharā's karma for the six years gestation period, but does mention Rāhula's same karma as a king. However, in the 13th-century Japanese devotional text \"Raun Kōshiki\", Rāhula's late birth is seen as evidence of a miracle, rather than a result of karma.\n\nThe second type of explanation consists of the more naturalistic argument that Yaśodharā is practicing religious austerities involving fasting and sleeping on a straw bed, which causes Rāhula's growth to slow down. She is involved in these practices during the time when Siddhārtha is practicing self-mortification. Later, King Śuddhodana prevents Yaśodharā from hearing any news of her former husband, and she gradually becomes healthier, as the pregnancy continues normally. However, some time later, the false rumor spreads that the former prince has died of his ascetism. Yaśodharā becomes very desperate and depressed, endangering her own pregnancy. When the news reaches the palace that Siddhārtha has attained enlightenment, Yaśodharā is overjoyed and gives birth to Rāhula. Buddhist Studies scholar John S. Strong notes that this account draws a parallel between the quest for enlightenment and Yaśodharā's path to being a mother, and eventually, they both are accomplished at the same time.\n\nThe late childbirth leads to doubts in the Śākya clan as to who is the father, as told in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, in the \"Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa\" and in the later Chinese \"Zabaozang jing\" (). Since Rāhula's birth was not regarded by Buddhists to be a virginal or miraculous birth, tradition had to explain that Prince Siddhārtha was actually the father. Yaśodharā responds by putting her child on a stone in a pond of water and making an act of truth that if Rāhula is really her child, that he and the stone may not sink, but rather float back-and-forth. After she makes the declaration, the child floats according to her vow. Strong notes that this is a symbolic parallel with the attainment of enlightenment by the Buddha, described as the \"further shore\", and coming back to teach humankind. The \"Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa\" contains another account, in which Prince Siddhārtha has several wives, and a wife other than Yaśodharā is the one defending her, being witness of her innocence.\n\nFurthermore, in both the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts and the \"Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa\", there is a third account that proves Yaśodharā's innocence: the Buddha makes everyone around him look identical to him, through a supernatural accomplishment. Rāhula proves that the Buddha is his true father when he manages to approach the real Buddha straight away. In a fourth story about proving Yaśodhara's purity, appearing in Chinese Avadāna-style texts from the 5th century CE onward, she is burnt alive, but miraculously survives. In this account, King Śuddhodana orders that she be killed by burning her alive as punishment for her alleged impurity. Instead of being hurt by the flames, however, she performs an act of truth and the fire transforms into a pond of water. Śuddhodana welcomes her and her son back into the clan, and later becomes very fond of Rāhula. Some Chinese Jātakas say that he recognizes his son Siddhārtha in the child, and manages to better cope with the loss of Prince Siddhārtha. Religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma sees the fire ordeal as a metaphor that parallels the Buddha's enlightenment, a similar argument that Strong makes.\n\nHistorian hypothesized that Prince Siddhārtha conceived Rāhula to please his parents, obtain their permission for leaving the palace and becoming a mendicant. He further speculated that the prince only conceived a son thirteen years after his marriage, because Yaśodharā initially did not want to bear a child, for fear that the prince would leave the palace and the throne as soon as the child was conceived. Orientalist and missionary believed that a late gestation period was more historically probable than the birth on the same day as in the Pāli tradition. She believed that if Prince Siddhārtha had left an heir to the throne, there would have been no sound reason for him to leave secretly at night. She further argued that there are many sources that try to explain the long gestation period, indicating an established tradition.\n\nBesides historical speculations, Buddhist Studies scholar Kate Crosby argues that Prince Siddhārtha conceiving or giving birth to a son before his renunciation functions as a motif to prove that he is the best at each possible path in life: after having tried the life of a father to the fullest, he decides to leave it behind for a better alternative. In early Buddhist India, being a father and bearing a son was seen as a spiritual and religious path as well as that of renouncing one's family, and Prince Siddhārtha's bringing a son in the world before renunciation proves he is capable of both.\n\nThe accounts continue and describe that Rāhula is raised by his mother Yaśodharā and grandfather King Śuddhodana. When Rāhula is seven, nine or fifteen years old, the Buddha returns to his home city of Kapilavastu at the request of Śuddhodana. The Mahāvastu text from the Lokottaravāda tradition states that the royals try to prevent Rāhula from learning about the return of his father, but eventually he insists to know who the \"Great Ascetic\" about to arrive is, and he is toldindologist Bhikkhu Telwatte Rahula argues that the child was conscious of being without father. Next, the Mahāvastu and the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts relate that Yaśodharā tries to tempt the Buddha back into his life as a prince by having Rāhula offer the Buddha an aphrodisiac. Mūlasarvāstivāda texts continue and tell that her plan backfires when the Buddha has Rāhula eat it himself, and Rāhula therefore becomes enamored by his father and wishes to follow him. In the Pāli version of the story, on the seventh day of the Buddha's return, Yaśodharā takes Rāhula to see his father, the Buddha. She tells Rāhula that since his father has renounced the palace life and as he is the next royal prince in line, he should ask his father for his inheritance of crown and treasure, for his future sake when his grandfather will no longer rule the kingdom. After the Buddha has had a meal, Rāhula follows the Buddha, asking him for his inheritance. The Buddha does not try to prevent Rāhula from following him, but in some versions of the story, some women from the court do try to, yet Rāhula persists. He then looks at his father and says, \"Pleasant is your shadow, recluse\". Reaching the Park of Nigrodha, where the Buddha is staying, the Buddha considers that the heritage of the throne will one day perish, and is tied up with suffering and stress: \"I will give him the wealth I obtained under the tree of enlightenment thus making him the heir of an inheritance that does not perish.\"\n\nMost traditions relate that the Buddha then calls Śāriputra and asks him to ordain Rāhula. Rāhula ordains and is the first \"śrāmaṇera\" (novice monk), and probably the first person in the monastic order to ordain in a formal way. In some versions of the story, such as the 9th century Chinese \"Weicengyou Yinyuan Jing\" (), a group of young boys ordain together with him. The king discovers that now his grandson, his son Nanda and a number of other young men in the royal family have ordained and left the palace. Seeing his daughter grieve, he asks the Buddha that from now on, he only ordain people with the consent of his parents. Śuddhodana explains that Rāhula's ordination was a great shock to him. The Buddha assents to the proposal. This rule is later expanded in the case of women ordaining, as both parents and the husband have to give permission first to allow women to join the order of monks and nuns. In some versions of the story of Rāhula's ordination, Yaśodharā also protests, but relents in the end. The Mahāvastu states, however, that Rāhula asks to ordain himself, and is eventually granted permission by Yaśodharā and Śuddhodana.\n\nArchaeologist Maurizio Taddei has noted that in many Gandharan art depictions, Rāhula's life is linked to that of a previous life of the Buddha, the hermit Sumedho. The Buddha giving his spiritual heritage to his son is compared to that of Sumedho allowing the Buddha Dīpaṃkara to walk over him, which is followed by Dipaṃkara predicting that Sumedho will become a Buddha in a future life. Both the figure of Gautama Buddha giving his inheritance to his son, and the figure of Dīpaṃkara Buddha giving his inheritance of Buddhahood to Sumedho are depicted with flames emitting from their bodies; both scenes are depictions of inheritance, filial and disciple piety; both may have been considered by 5th-century Buddhists to be representations of \"eager youth\".\n\nAccording to the Pāli texts, once Rāhula has become novice, the Buddha teaches Rāhula regularly. His instructions are very age-specific, using vivid metaphors and simple explanations. The Buddha's teachings have led to numerous discourses being named after Rāhula in the Early Buddhist Texts. Pāli texts relate how Rāhula grows up to become a novice that is diligent, dutiful, amenable and eager for learning, but there are also some early medieval Chinese and Japanese accounts which relate that Rāhula initially struggles with being a novice and only later appreciates the Buddha's teaching. Besides the Buddha, Śāriputra and Maugalyayāna also help to teach Rāhula. Rāhula often assists Śāriputra on his rounds for alms in the morning, and sometimes on other travels. Every morning, Rāhula wakes up and throws a handful of sand in the air, making the wish that he may be counselled by good teachers as much as those grains of sand.\n\nStill in the same year as Rāhula's ordination, the Buddha teaches his son the importance of telling the truth in a discourse known as the \"Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta\". In this discourse, the Buddha teaches and encourages consistent self-reflection, to help let go of all evil actions that lead to harm to oneself and others, and to develop self-control and a moral life. He encourages reflection before, during and after one's actions, and explains that lying makes the spiritual life void and empty, leading to many other evils.\n\nWhen Rāhula becomes eighteen years old, the Buddha instructs Rāhula in a meditation technique to counter the desires that hinder him during his tours for alms. Rāhula has grown enamored with his own and his father's handsome appearance. To help Rāhula, the Buddha teaches another discourse to him. He tells Rāhula that all matter is not-self, and the same holds for the different parts of one's mental experience. Having heard the discourse, Rāhula starts to practice meditation. His teacher Śāriputra recommends him to practice breathing meditation, but is unable to give Rāhula the instructions he needs. Rāhula therefore asks the Buddha to explain the meditation method in more detail and the Buddha responds by describing several meditation techniques to him. On a similar note, the Buddha teaches Rāhula at a place called Andhavana about the impermanence of all things, and instructs him how to overcome the \"taints\" inside the mind. As a result, Rāhula attains enlightenment. Pāli tradition has it that the sermon is also attended by a crore of heavenly beings, who once had vowed to witness the enlightenment of the son of the Buddha. Rāhula obtains the name \"Rāhula the Lucky\" (; ), which he himself explains is because of being the son of the Buddha, and because of having attained enlightenment.\n\nLater, the Buddha declares that Rāhula is foremost among all disciples in eagerness in learning (). and in the Pāli Udāna, the Buddha includes him as one of eleven particularly praiseworthy disciples. Chinese sources add that he is also known for his patience, and that he is foremost in 'practicing with discretion' (), meaning practicing the Buddha's teaching consistently, dedication to the precepts and study, but without seeking praise or being proud because of being the son of the Buddha. Pāli texts give examples of Rāhula's strictness in monastic discipline. E.g. after there was a rule established that no novice could sleep in the same room as a fully ordained monk, Rāhula is said to have slept in an outdoor toilet. When the Buddha becomes aware of this, he admonishes the monks for not taking proper care of the novices. After that, the Buddha adjusts the rule.\n\nPāli texts state that despite Rāhula being his son, the Buddha did not particularly favor him: he is said to have loved problematic disciples such as Aṅgulimāla and Devadatta as much as his own son, without any bias.\n\nLater in Rāhula's life his mother Yaśodharā becomes ordained as a nun. In one story, the nun Yaśodharā falls ill with flatulence. Rāhula helps her recover by asking his teacher Śāriputra to find sweetened mango juice for her, which is the medicine she is used to and requires. Therefore, with Rāhula's help, she eventually recovers.\n\nWhen he is 20 years old, Rāhula fully ordains as a monk in Sāvatthī.\n\nRāhula's death receives little attention in the earliest sources. Rāhula dies before the Buddha and his teacher Śariputra do. According to Pāli and Chinese sources, this happens as he is travelling through the second Buddhist heaven (). According to the early \"Ekottara Āgama\" (Sārvastivāda or Mahāsaṅghika tradition) and the later \"Śāriputrapṛcchā\", however, Rāhula is one the four enlightened disciples whom Gautama Buddha asks to prolong their lives to stay in the world until the next Buddha Maitreya has risen, to protect the current Buddha's dispensation.\n\nFollowing the Pāli and Sanskrit language sources, Rāhula is the son of the Buddha-to-be throughout many lifetimes. He develops his habit of being amenable and easy to teach in previous lives. Pāli texts explain that in a previous life he was impressed by the son of a previous Buddha, and vowed to be like him in a future life.\n\nTexts in the Mahayāna tradition describe that Rāhula is the eleventh of the 16 Elders (; Chinese tradition added two elders in the 10th century, making for 18 Elders), enlightened disciples that have been entrusted with taking care of the Buddha's dispensation until the rising of Maitreya Buddha. Tradition states therefore that Rāhula is still alive, and resides with 1,100 of his pupils in an island called the 'land of chestnuts and grains' (). The pilgrim Xuan Zang (602664) heard a brahmin claim that he met Rāhula as an old man, who had delayed his passing into Nirvana and was therefore still alive. On a similar note, Rāhula is considered one of the Ten Principal Disciples, known for his dedication to training new monks and novices. Moreover, he is considered to be one of the 2328 masters in the lineage of the Tiantai tradition, one of the 28 in the Chan lineage, and one of the eight enlightened disciples in the Burmese tradition.\n\nAs one of the enlightened disciples responsible for protecting the Buddha's dispensation, Rāhula has often been depicted in East Asian art. He is depicted with a large, \"umbrella-shaped\" head, prominent eyes and a hooked nose.\n\nThe Chinese monks Xuan Zang and Faxian (320420 CE) noted during their pilgrimages in India that a cult existed that worshiped Rāhula, especially in the Madhura area. Whereas monks would worship certain early male disciples following their particular specialization, and nuns would honor Ānanda in gratitude for helping to set up the nun's order, novices would worship Rāhula. The two Chinese pilgrims noted that Emperor Aśoka built a monument in honor of Rāhula, especially meant for novices to pay their respects. Religious studies scholar Lori Meeks points out with regard to Japan, however, that Rāhula was not the individual object of any devotional cult, but was rather honored as part of a group of enlightened disciples, such as the 16 Elders. Exception to this was the 13th14th century, when the figure of Rāhula became an important part of a revival of devotion to early Buddhist disciples among the old Nara schools, as chanted lectures (\"kōshiki\") rites, and images were used in dedication to Rāhula. On regular days of religious observance, male and female novices performed rites and gave lectures in honor of Rāhula. These were popular with the laypeople, as well as with priests that aimed to revive early Buddhist monastic discipline. In the \"kōshiki\" Rāhula was praised extensively, and was described as the \"Eldest Child\", \"eldest\" being a devotional term, since Prince Siddhārtha had no other children.\n\nThe \"Lotus Sūtra\", as well as later East Asian texts such as the \"Raun Kōshiki\", relate that Gautama Buddha predicts Rāhula will become a Buddha in a future life, named \"Stepping on Seven Treasure Flowers\" (). In these texts, Rāhula was seen as a Mahāyāna type of Buddha-to-be, who would save many sentient beings and live in a Pure Land.\n\nThe exhortations the Buddha gives to Rāhula have also become part of his legacy. The \"Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta\" became one of the seven Buddhist texts recommended for study in the inscriptions of the Emperor Aśoka. This discourse has been raised by modern ethicists as evidence for consequentalist ethics in Buddhism, though this is disputed.\n\nRāhula is mentioned as one of the founders of a system of Buddhist philosophy called the \"Vaibhāṣika\", which was part of the Sarvāstivāda schools. He is also considered by some Thai schools of Buddhist \"boran\" meditation to be the patron of their tradition, which is explained by referring to Rāhula's gradual development in meditation as opposed to the instant enlightenment of other disciples.\n\nFrom the narratives surrounding Rāhula several conclusions have been drawn with regard to Buddhist perspectives on childhood. Several scholars have raised Rāhula's example to indicate that children in Buddhism are seen as an obstacle to spiritual enlightenment, or that Buddhism, being a monastic religion, is not interested in children. Education scholar Yoshiharu Nakagawa argues, however, that Rāhula's story points at two ideals of childhood which exist parallel in Buddhism: that of the common child, subject to the human condition, and that of the child with a potential for enlightenment, who Crosby describes as a heroic disciple. Religion scholar Vanessa Sasson notes that although Prince Siddhārtha initially abandons his son, he comes back for him and offers a spiritual heritage to him as opposed to a material one. This heritage is given from a viewpoint of trust in the potential of the child Rāhula, presuming that the Buddhist path can also be accessed by children.\n\nThe acceptance of Rāhula in the monastic order as a child set a precedent, which later developed into a widespread Buddhist tradition of educating children in monasteries. The numerous teachings given to Rāhula have left behind teaching material which could be used for teaching children of different ages, and were sophisticated for the time period. Theravāda tradition further built on this genre, with Pāli manuals of religious teaching for novices.\n\n\n\n"}

The first Scavenger was Peter Mortimer, an Aquaman villain who debuted in \"Aquaman\" vol. 2 #37 (January 1968), and was created by Henry Boltinoff and Nick Cardy. He is re-introduced in the New 52 series \"Aquaman\" by writer Geoff Johns and artist Paul Pelletier.\n\nThe second Scavenger first appeared in \"Superboy\" #2 (March 1994), and was created by Karl Kesel and Tom Grummett.\n\nIn his first appearance, the first Scavenger was looking for something called the Time Decelerator. When he finds it, it apparently de-ages him to nothing. In his next appearance, while battling Aquaman for the second time, he explains that the Time Decelerator simply sent him into a timeless, limbo-like dimension. The Scavenger then resurfaces in the otherdimensional world of Skartaris, where he gains mystical powers, becoming the Scavenger of Souls and battling Travis Morgan, known as the Warlord. He apparently loses these mystical powers and returned to his own world sometime later.\n\nIn his next appearance, the Scavenger is shown to have reformed, also becoming a friend of Aquaman's. However, a later encounter with Hawkman retconned his redemption, stating that Peter Mortimer was secretly part of a pedophile ring who videotaped himself raping young boys and girls. Moreover, he now calls himself Barracuda and explains that he was the avatar of the barracuda, just as Hawkman is the avatar of the hawk. After Barracuda attempts to kill both Aquaman and Hawkman, Hawkman kills him.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, after the events of Throne of Atlantis, Mortimer begins scouring the ocean floor with the help of his minions for all Atlantean technology and weaponry, then sells them off to the highest bidder. He, along with villains such as the Weapons Master, the Key, the Scarecrow, Captain Cold, and the Cheetah were all attacked, captured, tortured, and interrogated by the villain David Graves who intended to acquire information on the members of the Justice League.\n\nMortimer was among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate of America during the events of the Forever Evil story arc, and was later captured along with several other members of the Secret Society by the reformed Justice League in the aftermath of the Crime Syndicate's defeat.\n\nThe second Scavenger first appeared in \"Superboy\" #2. He is an old man, with a wide range of weaponry at his disposal. Little of the man's history has been revealed, except once during Superboy and the Ravers he mentioned he was one of the men who originally were the Argonauts and challenged the gods, which led to his dilemmas later in life. He believes he is being persecuted by an enemy from his past, and stockpiles weapons and gadgets to be ready when the enemy strikes. The identity of the nemesis has never been revealed and only made one appearance near the end of Superboy's series in which the enemy's identity was never revealed; Scavenger suffers severe paranoia, and believes anyone who tries to stop him is working for his nemesis. He later joins the Secret Society headed by Alexander Luthor. Scavenger and other villains, including Red Panzer, are sent to Gotham City, where they go on a murderous attack against law enforcement officers.\n\nScavenger somehow survives to the 30th century (at least in the post-Zero Hour version of future history), where he fights Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes. By that time he has acquired the equipment of various 20th century superheroes.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, the second Scavenger is a member of Deathstroke's pirates after being broken out of a floating prison by Deathstroke. During an ambush by Aquaman and Ocean Master, Scavenger opens fire at Aquaman with a gun blaster, but Aquaman dodges, causing the blast to hit his shipmate, Tattooed Man. Aquaman then snaps Scavenger's body in two by breaking his back over his knee.\n\n"}

He came to national attention when his story was reported on in the September 5, 2005 issue of \"Time\" magazine.\n\nCarpenter was an employee of Sandia National Laboratories, investigating security breaches in its networks. However, upon tracking several breaches of Sandia, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Redstone Arsenal, and even NASA, dating back to 2003, Carpenter noticed patterns that began to appear to link the attacks to a single group. He was impressed by the meticulous, voracious and incredibly fast manner (sometimes completed in less than 30 minutes) in which the hackers operated. Such observations led him to alert the federal government of his findings.\n\nThe Titan Rain hacking operation was first reported in an August 25, 2005\" Washington Post\" article by Bradley Graham, which didn't mention Carpenter. Graham listed anonymous governmental officials as his sources.\n\nAfter informing his supervisors of the breaches, he was told that his only concern should be Sandia computers, and to drop the issue. His employment was later terminated when Carpenter disobeyed his management and communicated the information about the security breaches first to United States Army Cyber Counterintelligence Special Agents, who verified his information and later brought in the FBI. The FBI requested a Senior DAC Counterintelligence agent known in the counterintelligence community by the nickname \"Doc\" to handle Carpenter and lead the operation on behalf of the FBI. Carpenter was a confidential informant for the FBI for almost half a year before Sandia discovered his actions. Carpenter reportedly felt betrayed by the termination, as he viewed his actions were a service to his country, similar to that of his previous military service.\n\nAccording to Carpenter, during his termination hearing at Sandia, Bruce Held, Sandia's chief of counterintelligence, yelled \"[you're] lucky you have such understanding management... if you worked for me, I would decapitate you! There would at least be blood all over the office!\" During the subsequent court case, Held testified that he did use the word \"decapitate\" and, while he did not recall using the word \"blood,\" would not contest it. He also apologized.\n\nCarpenter sued Sandia National Laboratories for wrongful termination and defamation; a jury awarded him almost $4.7 million in compensatory and punitive damages on February 13, 2007. The jury more than doubled the punitive damages requested by Carpenter's attorneys Thad Guyer, Stephani Ayers and Philip Davis. The 13-person New Mexico state district court jury determined that Sandia's handling of Shawn Carpenter's termination was \"malicious, willful, reckless, wanton, fraudulent or in bad faith.\" Juror Ed Dzienis said that, \"If they (Sandia) have an interest in protecting us, they certainly didn't show it with the way they handled Shawn.\" Ms. Alex Scott, the jury forewoman, said jurors were upset by the lack of documentation of the process and by the \"reckless behavior on the part of Sandia to not have adequate policies in place for employees about hacking, and the cavalier attitude about national security and global security.\"\n\nCarpenter's wife, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, testified at the trial. Dr. Jacobs, a former Sandia scientist, nuclear engineer, West Point graduate, and Army Reserve Major, said Sandia management questioned her loyalty to the company after her husband was fired. Dr. Jacobs left Sandia and was later appointed as a White House Fellow, and was a director at the United States National Security Council. In an interview with the \"Albuquerque Journal\", Dr. Jacobs stated, \"The point for us all along was this is bad for the country to have contractors like Sandia Corporation behaving this way -- with impunity. And if other citizens don't do this, it's the beginning of the end for our country. That's what we kept coming back to: This is what we have to do, because it's what we expect of others.\"\n\nSandia Corporation, the private entity that manages Sandia National Laboratories on behalf of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Department of Energy and Federal Government of the United States, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the for-profit Lockheed Martin Corporation.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Carpenter testified at trial that he found hundreds of pages of detailed schematics and other sensitive documents labeled, \"Lockheed Martin Proprietary Information\" and \"Export Controlled\" regarding the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter stashed on a foreign server in South Korea. He was helping the FBI investigate the stolen Lockheed Martin information along with hundreds of other network breaches at military and United States defense contractors when Sandia officials fired him.\n\n, Carpenter is employed at NetWitness Corporation, a startup headed by Amit Yoran, former director of the National Cyber Security Division within the United States Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn March 2007, Sandia National Laboratories retained three additional attorneys at the international corporate defense firm of Baker Botts. In post-trial motions, Sandia attorneys unsuccessfully argued to throw out the jury verdict, to reduce the judgment to zero, and for a new trial. Carpenter's attorneys successfully argued a motion for post-judgment interest and Sandia was ordered to pay an interest rate of 15% per year on the final judgment of $4,742,146.66 (plus attorney fees) during the appeals process.\n\nIn April 2007, Sandia attorneys filed a motion to appeal the jury verdict. Sandia National Laboratories posted a $5.8 million supersedeas bond to prevent Carpenter from seizing Sandia assets during the appeals process. Interest in the amount of almost $60,000 a month accumulates while Sandia pursues their appeals. According to news reports, Sandia plans to appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court, if necessary, which could take years.\n\nOn October 14, 2007, \"The Albuquerque Journal\" published a story (\"Analyst, Sandia Settle Suit\") that stated that Sandia had dropped its appeal of the verdict. According to the story, the judgment had been accumulating 15 percent interest since the verdict in his favor in February 2007. The piece also related that Carpenter continues to work in the national security area for clients in the intelligence community, federal agencies and the military.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "632660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=632660", "title": "Thomas Ley", "text": "Thomas Ley\n\nThomas John Ley (28 October 188029 July 1947) was an Australian politician who was convicted of murder in England. It is highly likely that he was also involved in the deaths of a number of people in Australia.\n\nLey was born in Bath, England, but his father died in 1882 and his mother brought him and three siblings to Australia in 1886. He attended Crown Street Public School in Sydney until he was ten; then he worked as an assistant in his mother's grocery store. Having learnt shorthand, he became a junior clerk-stenographer in a solicitor's office at 14. He married Emily Louisa (known as \"Lewie\") Vernon in 1898, the year she came to Australia from England. Both husband and wife were active in politics, she in the international suffrage movement, and he as a state (New South Wales) and federal politician from 1917 to 1928.\n\nLey served in the lower house of the New South Wales parliament (1917–25) as member for Hurstville from 1917 to 1920, representing the Nationalist Party of Australia, and St George from 1920 to 1925, representing the Progressive Party from 1920 to 1922. He was a prominent and vocal advocate of proportional representation, which the state adopted in 1919. Both his electorates were in Sydney's southern suburbs.\n\nAs a teetotaller, Ley acquired the nickname \"Lemonade Ley\", but the temperance movement accused him of betrayal when he supported legislation which eased requirements for the sale of alcohol. It later emerged that he was being paid by the brewery lobby. Despite this, he was appointed as New South Wales Minister for Justice from 1922 to 1925 — in the cabinet of Premier Sir George Fuller — and gained a reputation for harsh decisions.\n\nShortly after he became Minister for Justice, Ley made an official visit to Western Australia and there was introduced to Maggie Evelyn Brook, a magistrate's wife. Shortly afterwards the magistrate died; Ley acted for her and her daughter in various financial and legal matters.\n\nIn 1925, Ley stood for the seat of Barton in the federal House of Representatives. He unsuccessfully tried to bribe his ALP opponent, Frederick McDonald, with a £2,000 share in a property at Kings Cross in return for withdrawing from the ballot. McDonald instead publicly revealed the attempted bribe. Despite this, Ley won the election on a large swing as part of the decisive Coalition victory that year. \n\nConventional wisdom would have suggested that Ley, as a former senior member of the New South Wales government, would have been considered for a post in the federal cabinet. However, Ley's fellow conservatives, above all Prime Minister Stanley Bruce, began to have doubts about him after the election. As a result, Ley was not considered for ministerial preferment.\n\nMcDonald took the matter of the bribe to court, but disappeared in mysterious circumstances. The case against Ley collapsed for lack of evidence when McDonald failed to appear. McDonald's disappearance may have been a coincidence. But in 1927, Hyman Goldstein (himself the state member for Coogee, and another of Ley's public critics) was found dead after apparently falling from \"Suicide Point\" on the cliffs of Coogee. Then a group of businessmen, concerned at Ley's reputation for dubious business dealings (SOS Prickly Pear Poisons Ltd being one of the more infamous), appointed Keith Greedor, an opponent of Ley but formerly an associate of his, to investigate. Travelling to Newcastle by boat, Greedor fell overboard and drowned.\n\nAfter his defeat in the 1928 election, Ley returned to England with Maggie Brook, his mistress of several years, leaving his wife in Australia.\n\nLittle is recorded of Ley's life during the 1930s. About all that can be said for certain is that he used his move to England to start afresh in dubious business ventures, and during World War II he was arrested and convicted for black marketeering.\n\nIn 1946 Maggie Brook was living in Wimbledon, and Ley had his house at 5 Beaufort Gardens, London, converted into flats. Ley imagined (wrongly) that Brook and a barman called John McMain Mudie were lovers. Ley persuaded two of his labourers that Mudie was a blackmailer, and together they tortured and killed him. The case became known as the \"Chalk-pit Murder\" because Mudie's body was dumped in a Surrey chalk-pit.\n\nWith Lawrence John Smith, Ley was tried at the Old Bailey, and both were sentenced to death in March 1947. However, both Smith and Ley escaped the noose: Smith's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, while Ley was declared insane and sent to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. There he died soon after of a cerebral haemorrhage. He is said to have been the wealthiest person ever to be a Broadmoor prisoner.\n\nLey's wife had followed him to England in 1942. From Broadmoor, Ley wrote letters and poems and protested his innocence to his wife and children. After his death, Lewie Ley returned to Australia; she died at Bowral, New South Wales, in 1956.\n\n\n"}

She was therefore selected for a place in the Australian team at the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics, where she won three gold medals and broke world records in the Women's Discus 1B, Women's Javelin 1B, and Women's Shot Put 1B events, and two silver medals in the Women's 60 m Wheelchair 1B and Women's Slalom 1B events. she was the most successful athlete at the games, the first Australian woman to win a gold medal at a Paralympic athletics competition, and one of Australia's first high-profile Paralympic competitors.\n\nShe defended her national titles in athletics events at the 1973 National Wheelchair Games in Adelaide and won a gold medal in the wheelchair slalom. She broke games records at the 1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Dunedin and won gold medals in the discus and shot put and silver medals in the 60 m and slalom at the first FESPIC Games in Japan the following year. At the 1976 Toronto Games, she won three gold medals and three world records in the Women's 60 m 1C, Women's Javelin 1C, and Women's Shot Put 1C events, and two silver medals in the Women's Discus 1C and Women's Slalom 1C events. She hoped to participate in the 1980 Arnhem Paralympics but a car accident just before the games forced her to withdraw from the competition. She made a comeback in the early 1990s, when she once again won medals in national competitions and set Australian records, before retiring in 1996.\n\nIn 1976, Freeman became the first athlete with a disability to win \"The Courier-Mail\" Sportswoman of the Year award. In 2000, she received an Australian Sports Medal. The Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association's Tracey Freeman Athlete of the Meet award is named after her. In December 2016, Freeman was inducted into the Australian Paralympic Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

{"id": "51289352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51289352", "title": "Widowhood effect", "text": "Widowhood effect\n\nThe widowhood effect is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time after their long-time spouse has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called \"dying of a broken heart\". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas & Kuttichira, 2013).\n\nPsychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement. The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing. Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically. During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising. Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide. Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.\n\nThis effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50 (Jegtvig, 2013).\n\nAlthough there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter. (Moon, et al., 2013)\n\nBoth men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women. Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.\n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 National Survey of Families and Households. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a Center for Epidemiologic Studies— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.\n\nExperimenters involved in the study regarding: \"The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes\", took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).\n\nIn a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).\n\nNicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.\n\nThe death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, & Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, & Sullivan, 2001).\n\nRecently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the broken heart syndrome (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016.)\n\nElderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends. It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.\n\nA study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.\n\nIn a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert & Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert & Christakis, 2008).\n\nThe widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).\n\nIt was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., & Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased mortality rate of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.\n\nIn April 2016, the American Heart Association published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as \"broken heart syndrome\". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.\n Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. \nThere is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.\n\nDeSpelder, L.

Bill Elmore authored two influential books during his life, \"Electronics-Experimental Techniques\" with Matthew Sands and the \"Physics of Waves\" with Mark Heald. He is also known for deriving a simple approximation for the delay through an RC network, known as the Elmore delay.\n\nWilliam Cronk Elmore was born in Montour Falls, New York to Thaddeus Perceval Elmore and Grace Cronk Elmore. Elmore had two sisters, Mary Elmore (b. 1902, d. 1907) and Eleanor Elmore (b. 1912, d. 2010). As a young man, Bill spent many of his days outside with his boy scout troop, experimenting with electronics and other technology, and building crystal radios. He attended Cook Academy in Montour Falls, New York and was the valedictorian upon his graduation in 1928. He earned a B.Sc. in Engineering Physics from Lehigh University (Phi Beta Kappa) in 1932 and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1935. Elmore began his career as a physics instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1935 to 1938. In 1936, Elmore married Barbara Page, the daughter of the Yale University physics professor, Leigh Page. Bill and Barbara were married for the next 66 years. They had 4 children, Mary-Leigh (b. 1939), David (b. 1945), Elizabeth (b. 1947, d. 2015), and Page (b. 1959).\n\nElmore was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in 1943. He played a major role in developing electronic circuits to handle the fast-pulse signals needed in the development of the atomic bomb. He also developed the electronics used to measure the strength of the first atomic test at Trinity test in New Mexico. At Trinity on July 16, 1945, Elmore observed the blast from the closest position of any observer, laying on a rubber mat beside J. Robert Oppenheimer behind a temporary wall of lead bricks and holding a piece of welding glass in front of his eyes. War era letters Barbara Page wrote to her mother and other family members detail the daily life of Elmore and his family while living in Los Alamos with the other Manhattan Project scientists, such as Enrico Fermi.\n\nIn 1946, Elmore and Matthew Sands wrote \"Electronics: Experimental Techniques\", which was published in 1949 by McGraw-Hill as part of the National Nuclear Energy Series. This book covered pre-transistor electronics including advances developed by the United States' war-time Atomic Energy Program, and became a standard reference for post-war instrumentation, influencing a generation of science and engineering students in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1957, Elmore returned to Los Alamos to work with the controlled fusion group. He was a delegate to the second Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva.\n\nIn 1938, Elmore joined Swarthmore’s physics faculty, retiring in 1974. He served as department chair from 1948 to 1968. Despite his clear potential for advancing theoretical and experimental physics, at Swarthmore, Elmore was known for developing (and publishing) laboratory experiments that effectively taught students the fundamentals of physics. Elmore and Heald co-wrote the 1969 textbook Physics of Waves. In 1965, Elmore received a Distinguished Service Citation from the American Association of Physics Teachers and was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society.\n"}
