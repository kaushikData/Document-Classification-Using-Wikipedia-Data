{"id": "1660690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1660690", "title": "Addison Bain", "text": "Addison Bain\n\nAddison Bain is a retired NASA scientist and founding member of the National Hydrogen Association who is credited with postulating the Incendiary Paint Theory (IPT), which posits that the Hindenburg disaster was caused by the electrical ignition of lacquer- and metal-based paints used on the outer hull of the airship. Thus Bain believes that the hydrogen in the airship had no part to play in the initiation of the disaster. This theory, which was proposed in 1997 and recently updated in his 2004 book, \"The Freedom Element: Living with Hydrogen\", has been generally accepted by people interested in promoting hydrogen as a transportation fuel, and generally rejected by people involved with airships and their history.\n\nBain attended Flathead High School, received his Bachelor of Science in Space Technology from Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), his Master of Science in Systems Management from FIT, and his Ph.D. in Engineering Management from CCU.\n\nThe primary refutation is based on the work of A. J. Dessler, D. E. Overs, and W. H. Appleby. Their work, both theoretical and experimental, has concluded that even if the airship were covered with solid rocket fuel, as the Incendiary Paint Theory claims, it would still have taken 12 hours for the airship to burn had hydrogen not been present. It is worth noting that this refutation misses the point of the theory, which relates only to what started the fire, not how it continued.\n\nThe case for the Incendiary Paint Theory is explained in Bain's televised demonstration of the extreme flammability of a piece of the actual skin of the \"Hindenburg\" preserved from the disaster. Bain demonstrates the incendiary properties of the \"Hindenburg\" skin and then asks why the bits of skin ejected from the inferno continued to burn brightly on their way down instead of self-extinguishing once removed from the zone of densest hydrogen. This question of \"self-extinguishing\" is important, since his critics point out that the components of the doping compound used on the skin should put themselves out if removed from any fuel for fire, and should not have burned so quickly if the fire actually started with the skin instead of the hydrogen.\n\nCritics also counter that Bain did not actually ignite the skin with a quick electrical charge but instead uses a Jacob's Ladder with \"continuous\" electrical charge, which required several strikes to ignite. Additionally, Bain was required to correctly position the fabric to allow it to ignite. Another part of the IPT hypothesizes that the mooring cables, which were designed to ground any static electricity on the surface of the airship, worked only partly in this instance; since some of the skin panels still carried an electric charge, at least one of them must have sparked, causing the initial outbreak of fire. Thus it has yet to be proven that an electrical charge could ignite the \"Hindenburg\" skin. The design of the ship would likely exclude the skin being an ignition point due to the properties of the doping process, the insulation from the frame and skin of the grounding drop-lines, and the inability of any experiment to ignite the skin via electric spark consistent with the conditions of the 1937 disaster.\n\nThe television show \"MythBusters\" also dedicated the opening episode for their 2007 season to Bain's theory. Scale models of the \"Hindenburg\" were built and tested with skin reproductions. One model had no hydrogen while the other did. The only burn that replicated the \"Hindenburg\" burn used hydrogen.\n\n6. \"The hydrogen technology assessment, phase 1 \", 1991, NASA Technical Reports Server\n\n7. \"An assessment of the government liquid hydrogen requirements for the 1995-2005 time frame including addendum, liquid hydrogen production and commercial demand in the United States\",1990, NASA Technical Reports Server\n\n8. \"An assessment of the government liquid hydrogen requirements for the 1995-2005 time frame \",1990, MASA Technical Reports Server\n\n"}

It is therefore a sub-category of the term Chinese American, the latter of which also includes those who were born in Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan but naturalized as U.S. citizens.\n\nAccording to some, the term has Perpetual Foreigner connotations. It has been noted that the term differs from existing patterns of immigrant designation in American English. For example, Peter Thiel is considered a \"German-born American,\" and Elon Musk is considered a \"South African-born American.\" In both of these cases, the first demographic word refers to the person's citizenship at birth, and the second refers to his citizenship at present. However, in the case of \"American-born Chinese,\" the first demographic word refers to the subject's citizenship at birth (or at present) and the second to his (or her) race.\n\nIt has also been observed that, in practice, the term American-born Chinese includes hundreds of thousands of Americans of Chinese descent who were, technically speaking, not born in America, but rather, we brought over by their parents at a young age. This indicates that the term may be a misnomer.\n\nIn differing degrees, many ABCs draw together Chinese family culture with American societal culture, developing a transnational life and identity. However, this begins to shift in subsequent generations as families structures change through interracial marriage. In 2000, approximately 45% of American-born Chinese marry non-Chinese Americans; this is contrasted with Chinese Americans more generally, whereby 81.5% of men and 77.9% of women married other Chinese Americans.\n\nThe term has been used in the 2006 comic book by Gene Luen Yang, entitled \"American Born Chinese\". It draws together the stories of three seemingly unrelated characters: Jin Wang, who moves into a new school and neighborhood to find he is the only Chinese American; the Monkey King of the Chinese fable \"Journey to the West\"; and Danny, who has yearly visits from his Chinese cousin Chin-Kee which ruins his life.\n\n"}

In 2012, Wilson released the EP \"Reservation\" and later signed a record deal with Universal Republic Records before moving to Republic Records. On December 31, 2013, Wilson released the debut album \"Dirty Gold\", which featured the singles \"Echelon (It's My Way)\" and \"Battle Cry\". Wilson has released a number of mixtapes, including \"Reservation\", which was ranked the sixth-best mixtape of 2012 by Mike Diver of the BBC. Their most recent mixtape is \"Back to the Woods\" (2015).\n\nWilson was born in Detroit, Michigan to a military family. Wilson's father, who passed away from a gunshot wound before Wilson was born, was African American and their mother is a Native American Cherokee. When Wilson was a young child their mother met a preacher in the Greater Apostolic Faith and she moved into his home with his wife and children, into what Wilson describes as a cult. Growing up in the church, Wilson witnessed domestic violence and manipulation at a very young age. As a child, Wilson was sexually abused by a man close to the family. Wilson also recalls being told that they would die spontaneously if they didn't behave correctly. In an interview with \"The Guardian\", Wilson stated: \"we all lived in the same community, within 10 minutes of each other. You weren't allowed to talk to anyone outside of that, you weren't allowed to wear jewelry, listen to music, to eat certain things, to date people...you weren't allowed to do pretty much anything.\"\n\nWilson's family moved around a lot, mainly due to their mother running away from the church. At one point Wilson's family was living in a shelter and Wilson was teased at school for it. Wilson was also mocked about their clothes at school and had difficulties making friends and connections due to moving around so often switched between homeschool and public school for many years and finished their high school education a year early.\n\nAfter a pastor threatened Wilson's mother, the family left the church and moved to Brooklyn, New York when Wilson was 15 years old. The pastor of their church told Wilson's family that God was going to kill them and Wilson's family lived in fear for years afterward.\n\nWilson began writing as a form of therapy and expressed an interest in creative writing, poetry and journalism. Wilson's first poem was published at the age of 13 after winning a school competition. As a child Roe took creative writing lessons and wanted to be a songwriter or gospel artist. Eventually, Wilson began making YouTube videos and freestyle rapping at the age of 18. Wilson began distributing music on the Internet through sites like Tumblr, where a fan base began to form.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Wilson put out a number of mixtapes for free download on the Internet: \"New Moon\", \"Altered Ego\", \"King\", and \"Voice\". In July 2012, Wilson released the free mixtape \"Reservation\" to critical acclaim, receiving an 88/100 score from Metacritic. The title \"Reservation\" serves as an homage to Wilson's Native American heritage. On December 9, the BBC announced that Wilson had been nominated for the Sound of 2013 poll.\n\nIn 2012, Wilson recounted the experience of being sexually assaulted as a child in \"Cleaning Out My Closet\", a song from the mixtape \"Classick\" that uses segments from Eminem's song of the same name.\n\nOn August 28, 2013, Wilson released \"Echelon (It's My Way)\" as the lead single from the debut album \"Dirty Gold\". The entire album was leaked on December 18, 2013, prior to scheduled March 2014 release. The album release was put forward and it appeared through Island Records and Republic Records on December 30, 2013, to positive reviews. It had low first-week sales of just over 5000 copies sold. On September 14, 2015, Wilson released the mixtape \"Back to the Woods\" announcing that the project was just \"something to share before a sophomore\". In March 2017 Wilson released \"Resurrection\".\n\nAfter Wilson moved to New York and began listening to secular music, they became inspired by artists such as Eminem, Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Drake and Lil Wayne. \"The artists that I identify [with] mostly are the ones who are so uncompromisingly themselves,\" Wilson said in a 2014 \"Rolling Stone\" interview. \"Like, 'fuck you. I don't care what you think about it. This is who I am. And I can either force-feed you this shit or you can take it as you will.'\"\n\nWilson raps about themes such as homophobia, rape culture and racism. Wilson uses their personal experiences to condemn a culture that breeds the self-harm of queer youth. Wilson has also been open about their experience with mental illnesses such as addiction, PTSD, depression and anorexia in their music and in interviews and social media.\n\nWilson sees their goal as an artist to reach out to people who are similar to them or going through difficult experiences. Wilson has said, \"It's not about the Bible. It's not about going to church. It's not about anything other than that we are all energies connected with a force that's greater than us. It's an energy that's omniscient, it covers the whole world and everybody here is created for a reason. Mine happens to be to make the music and inspire the people who are stuck in dark places.\"\n\nIn a 2014 \"Vice\" column, Wilson discussed cultural appropriation and white artists making hip hop. Wilson stated, \"There seems to be this hypocrisy, because people want to appropriate black culture but only when it's cool or beneficial to them... And that's the reason that people don't have a right, to some extent, to use black music to their own gains.\"\n\nWilson identifies as pansexual and as agender and use the pronoun 'they' for themself. Wilson has said \"I'm glad there's an actual woman of color representing queerness and pansexuality, someone who is like me in the spotlight.\" In an interview with \"The Guardian\", Wilson stated that, \"Love is boundary-less. If you can make me feel, if you can make me laugh – and that's hard – then I can be with you. I don't care if you have a vagina or if you're a hermaphrodite or whatever.\" \n\nIn 2014, they were in a relationship with model Ireland Baldwin. The two broke up a year later.\n\nIn 2015 Wilson noted in an interview with \"BuzzFeed\" that \"I feel like my agenderness and my gender identity have evolved\", and a year later explained that \"I sound like four people when I get written about as 'they'. It drives me crazy. If you call me 'him' or 'her' it doesn't matter to me. I don’t consider myself of any sex. I consider myself an experience.\"\n\nWilson covered Macklemore's \"Same Love\" and opened up about their own struggles with family over sexuality in their own interpretation of the song. In a 2017 \"Billboard\" interview Wilson stated, \"When I was young . . . I didn't understand what was going on. I didn't understand that I could be attracted to men and women at the same time.\"\n\nIn 2015, Wilson began working on a body image project titled \"The Naked Eye,\" which will incorporate nude photographs and interviews of people with body dysmorphia. The project is aimed at creating a conversation about conventional and mainstream beauty standards.\n\nWilson is self-taught in Tsalagi and celebrates their multiracial heritage.\n\n\n\n"}

In these publications, he describes the development of American Transcendentalism and its influence on western esotericism, including the contemporary phenomenon of \"immediatist gurus\", who promise instant enlightenment.\n\nIn \"American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions\", Versluis describes the influence of Asian religions on European Romanticism and on American Transcendentalism. In the early 19th century, these Asian religions were introduced to the western culture, and texts like the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads had a great impact on the Transcendental movement, and influential members like Emerson and Thoreau. But Transcendentalism was also influenced by western esotericism, a topic which until recently received little attention in the academia.\n\nIn \"The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance\" Versluis investigates the influence of western esotericism on the mid-19th American Renaissance. Versluis regards his \"The Esoteric Origins\" as a pioneering study in this discipline.\n\nIn \"American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion\", Versluis describes the emergence of immediatist gurus: gurus who are not connected to any of the traditional religions, and promise instant enlightenment and liberation. These include Eckhart Tolle, Ram Dass, Adi Da, and Andrew Cohen. \"Immediatism\" refers to \"a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term \"enlightenment\".\" According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want \"the fruit of religion, but not its obligations.\" Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history as far back as Platonism, and also includes Perennialism, Versluis points to Ralph Waldo Emerson as its key ancestor, who \"emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power.\"\n\nAnother \"trilogy\" deals with Christian theosophy, and includes \"Theosophia\" (1994), \"Wisdom’s Children: A Christian Esoteric Tradition\" (1999), and \"Wisdom’s Book: The Sophia Anthology\" (2000).\n\nVersluis is an editor of the \"Journal for the Study of Radicalism\", and founding editor of \"Esoterica\", which started as a journal, and is now a biannual print book series, \"Studies in Esotericism\".

{"id": "417052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=417052", "title": "Biddenden Maids", "text": "Biddenden Maids\n\nMary and Eliza Chulkhurst (or Chalkhurst), commonly known as the Biddenden Maids, were a pair of conjoined twins supposedly born in Biddenden, Kent, England, in the year 1100. They are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip, and to have lived for 34 years. It is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land to the village, known as the Bread and Cheese Lands. The income from these lands was used to pay for an annual dole of food and drink to the poor every Easter. Since at least 1775, the dole has included Biddenden cakes, hard biscuits imprinted with an image of two conjoined women.\n\nAlthough the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least 1605, no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to 1770. Records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known, and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters; it is not until the early 19th century that the names \"Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst\" were first used.\n\nEdward Hasted, the local historian of Kent, has dismissed the story of the Biddenden Maids as a folk myth, claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that the story of the conjoined twins was \"a vulgar tradition\" invented to account for it, while influential historian Robert Chambers accepted that the legend could be true but believed it unlikely. Throughout most of the 19th century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend. Despite the doubts among historians, in the 19th century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of Biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every Easter. In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.\n\nIn 1907, the Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.\n\nAccording to tradition Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, or Chalkhurst, were born to relatively wealthy parents in Biddenden, Kent, in the year 1100. The pair were said to be conjoined at both the shoulder and the hip. They grew up conjoined, and are said to have \"had frequent quarrels, which sometimes terminated in blows\". At the age of 34, Mary Chulkhurst died suddenly. Doctors proposed to separate the still-living Eliza from her sister's body but she refused, saying \"as we came together we will also go together\", and died six hours afterwards. In their wills, the sisters left five pieces of land in the Biddenden area comprising around in total to the local church, with the income from these lands (claimed to have been 6 guineas per annum at the time of their death) to provide an annual dole of bread, cheese and beer to the poor every Easter. Henceforward, the lands were to be known as the Bread and Cheese Lands.\n\nThe churchwardens of Biddenden continued to maintain the annual dole from the Bread and Cheese Lands. It is recorded that in 1605, the custom that \"on that day [Easter] our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread, cheese, cakes and divers barrels of beer, brought in there and drawn\" was suspended on account of a visit from Charles Fotherby, the Archdeacon of Canterbury, owing to previous ceremonies having caused \"much disorder by reason of some unruly ones, which at such time we cannot restrain with any ease\". In 1645, rector William Horner claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were glebe (land intended for the use of the parish priest), and attempted to take control of the lands. The case of the Bread and Cheese Lands was brought before the Committee for Plundered Ministers, who eventually found in favour of the charity in 1649. Horner brought the case before the Court of the Exchequer in 1656 but again without success, and the charity continued to own the lands and to operate the annual Easter dole. Witness statements from these cases mention that the lands had been given by two women \"who grew together in their bodies\", but do not give any name for the women.\n\nIn 1681 the \"disorder and indecency\" of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church; it was moved to the church porch.\n\nBy 1770, it is recorded that the annual dole took place immediately after the afternoon Easter service. The annual income from the Bread and Cheese Lands had risen to 20 guineas (about £ in 2018), and a huge quantity of food was distributed each year. By this time as well as the dole of bread, cheese and beer, hard bread rolls known as \"Biddenden cakes\", moulded into an image of the sisters, were thrown to crowds from the church roof. The Biddenden cakes were flat, hard and made of flour and water, and were described as \"not by any means tempting\"; one writer in 1860 described one as \"a biscuit plaque\".\n\nAlthough it is known that the charity had been in operation as early as 1656, an anonymous article in \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" in August 1770 is the earliest recorded account of the legend of the Biddenden Maids. This account states that the twins were joined at the hip only, rather than at both the hip and the shoulder, and that they lived to a relatively old age. The article explicitly states that their names were not recorded, and that they were known only as the \"Maids of Biddenden\". The anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole, and goes on to say that despite the antiquity of the events described, he has no doubt as to their authenticity. As with all accounts of the tradition prior to 1790 the author does not mention their alleged birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these details first appeared in a broadside published in 1790. \"The Antiquarian Repertory\" of 1775 says that the sisters had lived \"as tradition says, two hundred and fifty years ago\". Drawings of Biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women, possibly conjoined, but no names, dates or ages.\n\nHistorian Edward Hasted, in the third volume of \"The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent\" published in 1798, dismissed the legend of the Biddenden Maids. He claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were the gift of two women named Preston (although he elsewhere described the lands as having been \"given by persons unknown\"). Hasted stated that the Biddenden cakes had only begun to be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last 50 years (i.e. since 1748) and that the figures were intended to represent \"two poor widows, as the general objects of a charitable benefaction\". While he mentioned a legend that the figures represent two conjoined twins who died in their 20s and bequeathed the Bread and Cheese Lands to the parish, he dismissed it as \"a vulgar tradition\".\n\nHasted's arguments were largely accepted by influential historian Robert Chambers, and the story was generally treated as a folk myth. A letter to the \"British Medical Journal\" in 1869 pointed out that surnames were not in use in Kent in the 12th century, and that in older styles of English handwriting the 1 and 5 characters could easily be confused, and suggested a correct birthdate of 1500. The Biddenden Maids were occasionally mentioned in pieces on conjoined twins, particularly after Chang and Eng Bunker proved that conjoined twins could live to an advanced age and lead relatively normal lives. \"Notes and Queries\" magazine called in 1866 for a close examination of Biddenden documents, the editors describing Hasted's conclusions as \"very obscure and unsatisfactory\" and questioning why the names \"Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst\" should have been added to the design of cakes granted by a family named Preston, but no significant research into the tradition was carried out.\n\nAs the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at Easter, the first recorded mention of the names \"Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst\", and clay replicas of Biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs.\n\nIn the 1820s, a new account of the Biddenden Maids was published, which claimed that a gravestone marked with a diagonal line near the rector's pew in Biddenden church was the sisters' burial place. In 1830 it was noted that Biddenden was becoming thronged by visitors every Easter, \"attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by the usage, and the wonderful account of its origin, and the day is spent in rude festivity\". The large crowds were increasingly disorderly, and churchwardens on occasion had to use their staffs to hold back the mob. As a result, the distribution of the dole was moved from the church to the workhouse, but the crowds continued to cause problems. In 1882 Biddenden's rector applied for authority to abandon the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury permitted the distribution of bread, cheese and Biddenden cakes to continue, but abolished the free beer in an effort to combat the problem of unruly crowds.\n\nIn 1900, antiquarian George Clinch investigated the Biddenden Maids in detail. Examining the costumes of the figures on the Biddenden cake moulds, he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of Mary I (1553–1558), a date roughly consistent with the \"two hundred and fifty years ago\" reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century. He suggested that the \"1100\" date on Biddenden cakes had originally read \"1500\", and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error. It is likely that the cake moulds examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775. Writing in the early 1930s, William Coles Finch explains the confusion over the dates, saying \"the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one\". He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be unleavened bread.\n\nIn almost all drawings and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented.\n\nAlthough Clinch believed that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they had lived in the 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617 – after 1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.\n\nIn 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne considered the case of the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.\n\nJan Bondeson (1992 and 2006) proposed that, while the names \"Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst\" are not recorded in any early documents and are likely to have been a later addition, the existence of the twins and the claimed 1100 year of birth cannot be dismissed. Although mediaeval chronicles are unreliable, he noted multiple reports in the Chronicon Scotorum, the Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Clonmacnoise of a pair of conjoined sisters born in or around 1100, although all three are records of Irish history and none mention Kent as the location. He concluded that the case of Christine McCoy, who survived for eight hours following the death of her polypagus twin Millie, shows that the claimed six hours between the deaths of the Biddenden Maids is plausible, and agreed with Ballantyne's proposal that the idea that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later misinterpretation of the figures on the Biddenden cake. He also pointed out that although there is no recorded version of the legend prior to 1770, there would have been no possible motive for the villagers of the 18th century to fabricate the story.\n\nIn 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated with other local charities with similar purposes, to form the Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still functioning as a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.\n\nThe tradition of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners through the windows of Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n\n"}

He is most well-known for his worldwide chart topping albums of the late 1970's and hit singles including \"Lido Shuffle\" and the Grammy award winning \"Lowdown\" from the critically acclaimed album \"Silk Degrees\" (1976), which peaked at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Scaggs continues to write, record music, and tour.\n\nScaggs was born in Canton, Ohio, the eldest child of a traveling salesman. Their family moved to McAlester, Oklahoma, then to Plano, Texas (at that time a farm town), just north of Dallas. He attended a Dallas private school, St. Mark's School of Texas, where schoolmate Mal Buckner gave him the nickname \"Bosley\", later shortened to \"Boz\".\n\nAfter learning guitar at the age of 12, Scaggs met Steve Miller at St. Mark's School. In 1959, he became the vocalist for Miller's band, the Marksmen. The pair later attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison together, playing in blues bands like the Ardells and the Fabulous Knight Trains.\n\nLeaving school, Scaggs briefly joined the burgeoning rhythm and blues scene in London, then traveled on to Sweden as a solo performer, and in 1965 recorded his solo debut album, \"Boz\", which failed commercially. He also had a brief stint with the band the Other Side with Mac MacLeod and Jack Downing.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Scaggs promptly headed for the booming psychedelic music center of San Francisco in 1967. Linking up with Steve Miller again, he appeared on the Steve Miller Band's first two albums, \"Children of the Future\" and \"Sailor\" in 1968. Scaggs secured a solo contract with Atlantic Records in 1968, releasing his second album, \"Boz Scaggs\", featuring the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section and session guitarist Duane Allman, in 1969. Despite good reviews, this release achieved only moderate sales. He then briefly hooked up with Bay Area band Mother Earth in a supporting role on their second album \"Make a Joyful Noise\" on guitar and backup vocals. Scaggs then signed with Columbia Records; his first four albums for Columbia all charted, with his best peaking at No. 81.\n\nIn 1976, using session musicians who later formed Toto, he recorded \"Silk Degrees\". The album reached #2 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, and #1 in a number of other countries, spawning four hit singles: \"It's Over\", \"Lowdown\", \"What Can I Say\", and \"Lido Shuffle\", as well as the poignant ballad \"We're All Alone\", later recorded by Rita Coolidge and Frankie Valli. \"Lowdown\" sold over one million copies in the US and won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song, which was shared by Scaggs and David Paich.\n\nA sellout world tour followed, but his follow-up album in 1977 \"Down Two Then Left\" did not sell as well as \"Silk Degrees\" and neither of its singles reached the Top 40. The 1980 album \"Middle Man\" spawned two top 20 hits, \"Breakdown Dead Ahead\" and \"Jojo\"; and Scaggs enjoyed two more hits in 1980-81: \"Look What You've Done to Me\", from \"Urban Cowboy\" soundtrack, and \"Miss Sun\", from a greatest hits set. Both were US No. 14 hits.\n\nScaggs took a long break from recording and his next album, \"Other Roads\", did not appear until 1988. \"Heart of Mine\", from \"Other Roads\", is Scaggs' last top-40 hit as of 2018. Also in 1988, he opened the San Francisco nightclub \"Slim's\", and remained an owner of the venue as of 2011.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, Scaggs joined Donald Fagen, Phoebe Snow, Michael McDonald and others in The New York Rock and Soul Revue. His next solo release was the album \"Some Change\" in 1994. He issued \"Come On Home\", an album of rhythm and blues, and \"\", an anthology, in 1997.\n\nHe garnered good reviews with \"Dig\" although the CD was released on September 11, 2001. In May 2003, Scaggs released \"But Beautiful\", a collection of jazz standards that debuted at number one on the jazz chart. In 2008 he released \"Speak Low\", which he described in the liner notes as \"a sort of progressive, experimental effort ... along the lines of some of the ideas that Gil Evans explored.\" During 2004, he released a DVD and a live 16-track CD \"Greatest Hits Live\" that was recorded August 2003 at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.\n\nAfter a break in recording, he undertook a series of shows across the US in 2008. Two years later he joined Donald Fagen and Michael McDonald for concerts entitled the Dukes of September Rhythm Revue. Scaggs's next album \"Memphis\" was released in March 2013. It was recorded in that Southern American city at the Royal Studios. The album included some of his favorite compositions from other artists. A tour of the United States, Canada and Japan followed the release. Before the year ended, he added live dates across North America and Australia for 2014. In 2015, he released \"A Fool to Care\", a compilation of mostly covers, including \"Whispering Pines\" with Lucinda Williams, and one original blues composition, \"Hell to Pay,\" performed with Bonnie Raitt. The album rose to number one on the \"Billboard\" Blues Album chart and number 54 on the Billboard 200.\n\nScaggs' first marriage was to Carmella Storniola. They had two sons: Austin, a music journalist with a column called \"The Smoking Section\" in \"Rolling Stone\", and Oscar, who at age 21 died of a heroin overdose in 1998. Scaggs and Carmella divorced in 1980, and after a child custody battle, they were awarded joint custody of their sons. Carmella died in February 2017.\n\nScaggs and his current wife Dominique (whom he married in 1992) grow grapes in Napa County, California, and have produced their own wine.\n\n\n\n"}

Some also relate his name to the deity Xipe Totec.\n\nAccording to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziguet, now commonly known as La Siguanaba, and \"Lucero de la mañana\" (Lúcifer Morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair. When Ziguet's husband found out about this affair he sought the assistance of the very powerful god Teotl. Ziguet and \"Cipitio\" were cursed and condemned by Teotl. Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents. Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that Cipitio has his feet backwards, they follow them in the wrong direction.\n\nCipitio is represented as liking to eat ashes, throwing pebbles to beautiful ladies, and likes to eat a variety of banana called \"Guineo Majoncho\".

{"id": "29056985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29056985", "title": "Darkman (character)", "text": "Darkman (character)\n\nDarkman is a title character and the protagonist of the 1990 superhero film \"Darkman\" and its sequels, \"\" and \"\". The character originated in a short story written by the film's director, Sam Raimi, titled \"The Darkman,\" and is based on the Universal Pictures' movie monsters while retaining traits of the DC Comics World War II disfigured hero the Unknown Soldier. He was portrayed by Liam Neeson in the original film and Arnold Vosloo in the sequels.\n\nIn the third film and the un-aired television pilot, his biography is slightly retconned, but the character's canonical history is as such: Peyton Westlake was a mild-mannered and brilliant scientist working on a synthetic \"skin\" capable of aiding burn victims. He had a good relationship with district attorney Julie Hastings, who indirectly caused his injuries by telling corrupt developer Louis Strack, Jr. that he could not build his \"city of the future\" without a permission document from Westlake's laboratory. At this, Strack hired sadistic mobster Robert G. Durant to get the document and in the process, Durant and his gang brutally disfigured Westlake, killed his assistant and destroyed his lab.\n\nJulie believed he was dead and a funeral was held, but Westlake's hideous body was placed in a clinic that was used for various experiments to sever Westlake's pain receptors, which enhances his strength but leaves him unable to feel tactile sensations. The experiments, however, affected Westlake's mental stability and he became an impulsive, bipolar, sarcastic, and violent man. Westlake escaped the clinic and sought refuge in an abandoned building in the film's city. He hid his grotesque appearance with bandages and a trenchcoat and used his synthetic skin, which only lasts 99 minutes in the light. He managed to rebuild a relationship with Julie, claiming he survived his \"accident\" and was constantly fleeing so that she does not see his true face. As \"Darkman\", he begins ruining Durant's illegal activities by framing his gang so Durant kills his own men, including his possible implied lover. After discovering the culprit is Darkman, Durant attempts to kill him from a helicopter using a grenade launcher. Darkman manages to defeat his archenemy by clinging to the helicopter and using his strength to pull it into a tunnel and explode the chopper. Darkman gratifyingly yells \"Burn in Hell!\".\n\nAfter this, Darkman poses as Durant in order to infiltrate Strack's new skyscraper, which was the reason the developer hired Durant in the first place. Strack suspects Darkman will come after him and takes Julie hostage. Strack suggests they join forces but when he refuses the battle atop the skyscraper. Darkman has the chance to spare his life but instead throws Strack to his death. Believing he has become too much of a monster to be with Julie, that he abandons her, vowing to become a vigilante and bringer of justice.\n\nAfter a year of crimefighting, Darkman is shocked to discover that Durant is alive and back in town and that he must again battle his archenemy. He also wishes to avenge a scientist named Brinkman, who he had been partnering with in order to perfect his synthetic skin so he may lead a normal life. After defeating Durant, Darkman found a new enemy in drug lord Peter Rooker who proved to be his most powerful adversary after going through a process that makes his strength equal to Darkman's. Darkman managed to bring down Rooker by posing as him but felt conflicted as he fell in love with Rooker's wife and children, who he had to abandon as well to resume his life as a vigilante. Beforehand, however, he finally manages to perfect his synthetic skin but uses the only sample to heal Rooker's daughter.\n\nDue to clinical experiments, the nerve endings connected to Darkman's skin have been severed, rendering him immune to pain, but unable to feel physical sensations. Additionally, to compensate for his loss of physical feelings, adrenaline flows unchecked through Darkman's body, enhancing his physical strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability.\n\nUsing his synthetic skin, Darkman is able to pose as criminals, imitate their voices, and trick them into engineering their own downfall. He's also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and an expert in the fields of science with a genius-level intellect.\n\nDarkman possesses similar ethics to those of a superhero, such as not harming the innocent, but has the tenacity and impulsiveness of a psychopath, as demonstrated when he revels in the suffering of criminals. He also has a dangerous temper, as seen in \"Darkman\" when he (disguised as his former self) breaks the fingers of an obnoxious carnival worker for refusing to give Julie Hastings the prized elephant. When Julie refuses the prize, he remarks, furiously, \"Take the fucking elephant!\" When a cat hisses at him, he is enraged and argues with the cat, and accuses it of thinking he is a \"freak of nature.\" Despite his temper and preference for violence, Darkman also has a morbid sense of humor in sticky situations. For example, Darkman breaks into a business meeting while attached to Durant's chopper. He remarks to the businessman, \"Excuse me!\" before being pulled off again, and when Strack begs for mercy, stating murder will haunt his conscience. Darkman, after only some hesitation, drops him to his death and remarks, \"I'm learning to live with a \"lot\" of things.\"\n\nThis film documents Darkman's origins and his relationship with Julie, and systematically showing his transformation into a vengeful criminal killer and his first battle with Durant and the businessman Strack.\n\nDurant survives his ordeal from the first film and plans to take over the city using futuristic weaponry. Only Darkman can stop his archenemy and avenge one of Durant's latest victims.\n\nDrug lord Peter Rooker allies with a scientist who also worked on Darkman's superhuman strength and invulnerability. He invents a steroid that gives test subjects superhuman strength, but leaves them mentally unstable. Darkman then poses as Rooker to foil his plan, but ends up having to save the villain's family.\n"}

He is also a long-term nonprogressor diagnosed in 1992. Levy is the CEO and founder of Black and Latino AIDS Coalition, Inc (Blac) Blac NY is a community-based AIDS advocacy organization. It advocates on behalf of Black and Latino people with AIDS and their families and works for prevention of HIV and AIDS. In 1998, Levy helped pass HIV Reporting and Partner Notification. It was the most controversial HIV legislation in New York State history . The legislation changed the way New York State tracked new HIV and AIDS cases i.e. Partner Notification. Prior to the legislation, the federal government's Ryan White Program allocated money based on the proportion of patients with AIDS in each region. The highest number of AIDS cases was in New York City among white gay men. Consequently, the white gay population received the most money. The new legislation changed this allocation to give more funding to people who were newly diagnosed with HIV infection. A majority of people with HIV diagnoses were black and Latino heterosexuals. Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn sponsored a Bill that required people infected with HIV to notify their sexual partners. The 'Black and Latino AIDS Coalition' was the only AIDS organization in New York State to support Assemblywoman Mayersohn's bill. Levy engaged in heated debates raging in the HIV community concerning the need for establishing a system of tracking HIV infection.\n\nDennis Levy, Rick Levy, and his brother Harry Levy founded the Black and Latino AIDS Coalition, Inc (Blac NY) It was one of the nation's first AIDS organization for heterosexual black and Latino people living with AIDS. Blac NY was modeled after the national direct action advocacy group ACT UP and received financial assistance and technical help from 'Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC). Under Levy's leadership, Blac NY educated thousands of black and Latino heterosexuals about AIDS. He helped turn public attention to the crisis by writing about 'AIDS IN THE HOOD'. Levy challenged the mainstream AIDS establishment on the hot button issue of 'mandatory reporting' and 'partner notification'.\n\nDennis Levy was part of the changing face of AIDS. He was a heterosexual African American man. African American Heterosexual men and women represented one of the largest and fastest growing populations in new AIDS cases. Levy addressed the homophobic fears of African American heterosexual men. Blac NY worked to get the help of black and Latino churches in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The effort ultimately resulted in over 30 national HIV/AIDS organizations and leaders joining forces in an urgent call for the development and implementation of a comprehensive National AIDS Strategy. On July 13, 2010 the White House released the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS). This ambitious plan is the nation's first-ever comprehensive coordinated HIV/AIDS roadmap with clear and measurable targets.\n\nFor his AIDS, Levy began a regimen that included an antiviral therapy, but the therapy's side effects included disorientation and nausea and caused pain throughout his body. Nothing he tried reduced the side effects. A friend suggested Levy try smoking marijuana. Levy began smoking marijuana on a regular basis and it helped him with his side effects from AIDS medicines - as well as eliminated the incredible headaches he used to get. He discovered many people used marijuana for similar reasons. There is evidence that medical marijuana works. Levy decided to become an advocate for legal medical marijuana and he founded 'New York State Committee to Legalize Marijuana'.\n\nDennis Levy and Rick Levy founded the 'New York State Committee To Legalize Marijuana'. Dennis Levy became President and Rick Levy was Vice President of Social Media. Dennis Levy is the only HIV positive African American President of a legalized marijuana organization in New York State. Levy's daughter Deniece Kinash is the mixed race coordinator. Today, Dennis Levy is one of the most out spoken leaders of the 'New Marijuana Movement'. White people and black people used marijuana in the same amounts. But \"Blacks are arrested for marijuana possession at a two and a half times greater rate than whites\". Levy says \"Marijuana prohibition policy does more harm to our communities than good.\" Levy has worked with International social and political activist Dana Beal in advocating for legalization of marijuana. Dana Beal is an Honorary member of the 'Committee'. Levy is also a member of the Green Party of New York. Levy ran for the New York State Assembly Seat of convicted speaker Sheldon Silver in the April 19, 2016 special election (Silver's conviction was overturned by The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan on July 13, 2017). Dennis Levy was the Green Party candidate.\n\nIn the election, hand picked Democratic candidate Alice Cancel faced Republican Lester Chang, Green Party candidate Dennis Levy and Working Families Party candidate Yuh-Line Niou, who had out raised Cancel overwhelmingly and was seen as a candidate who could make the race close. In surprisingly closely watched race, Cancel ultimately won the election with 41% of the vote, besting Niou by 1,034 votes, with Chang and Levy together taking 23%.\n"}

He influenced many in California and thus changed the political debate on marijuana in the United States.\n\nPeron was born in The Bronx, New York City, into an Italian-American family and grew up in Long Island. He served in the United States Air Force in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. After the war, he moved to the Castro District, San Francisco, where he became an active Yippie and organized smoke-ins. He also supported gay activist Harvey Milk, a former Long Island resident, who won an elected seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977.\n\nPeron sold cannabis from storefronts in the Castro and advocated for medical cannabis, as he saw how patients with AIDS benefited from it. His partner, Jonathan West, whom he met in San Francisco, died of AIDS in 1990. In 1991, Peron organized for the passage of San Francisco's Proposition P, a resolution calling on the state government to permit medical cannabis, which received 79% of the vote. That same year, he co-founded the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club, the first public cannabis dispensary. His businesses were raided by authorities in 1978 and 1990. In 1993, Peron and Brownie Mary jointly released a cookbook with recipes for cannabis edibles.\n\nIn 1996, Peron coauthored California Proposition 215, which sought to allow the use of medical cannabis. Dan Lungren, the Attorney General of California, ordered a police raid of Peron's club a month before the election, arresting Peron. Proposition 215 was passed soon thereafter, which allowed the club to reopen. Later in 1996, the Grassroots-Legalize Cannabis Party of Minnesota fielded Peron as their nominee, their first, in the U.S. presidential election. Peron received 5,400 votes. In 1998, Peron ran in the Republican primary for California governor against Lungren, who won the primary and lost the election to Gray Davis.\n\nPeron voiced support for decriminalization of all marijuana use, believing that it is medicinal. He opposed medical marijuana use for children. Peron opposed California Proposition 19 in 2010, which would have legalized recreational cannabis, because he did not believe that recreational use exists, as all people who use marijuana are using it medicinally. He opposed California Proposition 64 in 2016.\n\nLater in life, Peron owned and operated a cannabis farm near Clearlake, California. San Francisco's Board of Supervisors recognized Peron, who was suffering with late-stage lung cancer, with a certificate of honor in 2017. Supervisor Jeff Sheehy called Peron \"the father of medical cannabis\". On January 27, 2018, aged 72, Peron died of lung cancer at the Veteran’s Administration Health Center in San Francisco.\n\n"}

She married William Pearce, who had at an early age shown himself to be an outstanding ship builder and by 28 was manager of Messrs Robert Napier and Sons. They set up home in Govan and occupied John Elder's villa for many years which was demolished to make for the Princes Dock. From there they moved to Wemyss Bay further down the west coast of Scotland. \n\nAs the wife of a successful man she was required to entertain on a regular basis but she did not allow her privileged position to stop her becoming involved in the lives of ordinary Govan people. She believed until her death that working people had been let down by the government. Her husband became MP for Govan in 1885 and became a baronet two years later. Sir William was at the peak of his career and had by then become owner of Fairfield Shipyard Company which was by then a world leader. She is particularly remembered for her involvement in helping to set up the well-known project 'Fresh-Air-Fortnight' which afforded the opportunity for sick children to have a holiday usually at the seaside but also in the country in order to help their recovery. She was on the school board of Govan Parish from 1873 and during that time argued for female representation on school boards. It was said of Lady Pearce, \"Any community was well off where there was a 'Good Angel' in the district, with a liberal heart and a readiness to help forward the best interest of the people and the district\".\n\nShe had a strong, enduring friendship with Margaret Macgregor, and employed Margaret as the lady superintendent of the Fairfield Works Mission, whose headquarters were in Harmony Row. Lady Pearce became more deeply involved in religion through her friendship with Margaret. Like Margaret, she was non-sectarian in her approach to her philanthropy and made contributions to all the churches. After Margaret's death, Lady Pearce had a church erected in Margaret's memory, the Margaret Macgregor Memorial Church.\n\nIn 1906 Lady Pearce built the Pearce Institute as a gift to the people of Govan. It is a beautiful A-listed building containing a public hall, library and other rooms. She was a generous supporter of the Govan Press fund and was concerned about the wellbeing of soldiers, disabled children and anyone suffering hardship. To the end she continued to have an interest in the work of the Pearce institute.\n\nShe is also known for leaving an endowment in her will to support St Johns College, Durham. \n\nShe died at the age of 82 in 1918 at St Brandon's Wimbledon, where she had lived for many years.\n"}

{"id": "881063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=881063", "title": "Ethan Allen (armsmaker)", "text": "Ethan Allen (armsmaker)\n\nEthan Allen (September 2, 1808 – January 7, 1871) was a major American arms maker from Massachusetts. He is unrelated to the revolutionary Ethan Allen. His first firearm, the \"Pocket Rifle\" was developed in 1836, and his first patent was granted in 1837.\n\nAllen began his career as a cutlery maker in Milford, Massachusetts in 1831. He gained the knowledge of metalworking and manufacturing processes by producing knives and shoemaking tools before moving his business to Grafton.\n\nWhile working on a cane gun for a doctor, Allen came up with the idea for an underhammer pocket rifle and designed it in 1836. The following year he applied for a patent for a \"tube hammer\" pocket pistol and went into business with his brother-in-law, Charles Thurber. Ethan proved to be a true family man, investing and partnering with a nephew in a New York sporting goods retailer, hiring another brother-in-law Thomas Wheelock who was eventually made a partner, and similarly hiring and later making partner his two sons-in-law Sullivan Forehand and Henry Wadsworth. The latter two continued the business under their own names after Allen's death in 1871.\n\nIn 1843 the company relocated to Norwich, Connecticut. In addition to armsmaking, they built prototypes of Thurber's typewriter designed for the blind, disabled and those “nervous” about writing by hand. Though patented, the typewriter was never manufactured for commercial sale.\n\nIn 1847, the company moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, and in 1854 Wheelock became an equal partner with the firm's name changing to Allen Thurber & Co. In 1856, following Thurber's death, the company reorganized as Allen & Wheelock. After the death of Wheelock in 1865, Allen's 2 sons-in-law, Sullivan Forehand and H. C. Wadsworth, began working for him and the company changed names to Allen & Company. Upon Allen's death in 1871 the two operated the company under their own names: Forehand & Wadsworth, until Forehand reorganized the company in 1890 as the Forehand Arms Company after Wadsworth's retirement.\n\nEthan Allen's companies made a vast variety of firearms. Most recognized are the Allen & Thurber Pepper-box revolving pistol—known as the \"Gun that won the East\". This pistol was actually much more common that the early Patterson Arms revolvers made by Colt. Few records survive, so much is derived from the physical weapons still in existence and by extrapolating from advertisements, patent dates, etc.\n\nPocket Rifle\n\nAllen's first firearm was the Pocket Rifle, a single-shot under-hammer percussion pistol. The name likely derives from the fact that most pistols of the day did not have rifled barrels, rather than any claim to extraordinary size. The hammer located on the bottom of the weapon allowed for target sights to be mounted on the top axis of the barrel. Made in .28 to .44 caliber, average barrel length was 12 inches. Typically sold in pairs, the pocket rifle was produced during 1837–1847. Though most of this period was during the Thurber partnership, markings show exclusively 'Ethan Allen', and evidence from an accounting ledger indicate that supply and distribution orders processed separately from other models of firearms. This likely indicates that Allen retained ownership of this model after establishing the partnership with Thurber. A second pocket rifle was produced under the Allen and Thurber name retaining the under-hammer design, but with much smoother lines. The pictures the author has seen show a barrel much shorter than 12 inches, and the caption reads .36 caliber.\n\nTube Hammer Pistol\n\nA single-shot percussion pocket pistol with the hammer in the more usual top position for contemporary pistols. The spectacular innovation was the 'double action' which allowed firing simply be pulling the trigger. Most firearms of the day and for decades thereafter were 'single action', requiring the user to manually cock the firearm prior to pulling the trigger. The barrel had a smooth bore with no rifling. With no sights, this was a close range personal defense weapon used with a 'point and shoot' method rather than careful aiming. This model also introduced a screw barrel, allowing for easy disassembly and cleaning. Judging solely from patent dates, production of this pistol began around 1837 and continued beyond 1844 when a patent reissue was granted.\n\nModel 9 Bar Hammer Pistol\n\nThe tube hammer was followed shortly by the Bar Hammer single-shot percussion pistol. Produced in a wide variety of calibers and barrel lengths, the Model 9 introduced a bar-shaped hammer on the top of the barrel which would be less likely to catch on clothing when drawn from a coat pocket. Barrel length was typically 2-6 inches with a smooth bore, while the most common calibers were .30-.36. Retaining the double action, single shot, screw barrel design of the tube-hammer, the Model 9 was a success and was produced well into the Allen and Wheelock era. Though made possibly as early as 1837–1838, the bar hammer was eventually marked with an 1845 patent date.\n\nModel 6 Shotgun Hammer Boot Pistol\n\nsingle-shot percussion pistol\n\nInline Pistol\n\nsingle-shot percussion pistol\n\nDouble Barreled Single Trigger Pistol\n\npercussion pistol\n\nAn entire volume could be written about the variations of the Allen and Thurber iconic pepperbox 'revolving pistols'. Often referred to as 'the gun that won the east', the Allen and Thurber pepperbox was a favorite of '49'ers' and other early immigrants to the western United States. Mark Twain famously quipped that these pistols often discharged more than one barrel when fired, and were not much of a danger to the target, but were dangerous to the shooter. Holding several patents, Allen and Thurber pepperboxes were the most popular multi-shot pistols of the 1830s and 1840s, slowly losing market share in the 1850s to Colt's 1849 Pocket and 1851 Navy revolvers. The later pepperbox revolvers were produced well into Allen and Wheelock era. With the shortage of pistols in the American Civil War, many soldiers on both sides carried an Allen & Thurber pepperbox as a back-up arm. Harley Van Cleve and his son Phillip collected and categorized 22 distinct models/variations of the Allen pepperbox, and were an invaluable early 20th century resource for these interesting pistols. Patent dates of 1837 and 1845 help to demarcate sub-models to a limited extent, but many improvements were incorporated on the fly to reduce manufacturing costs and/or create a more reliable product. The 1845 patent represents several simplifications to the design that likely achieved both of these aims. Pepperbox production did not survive the end of the Allen and Wheelock era (c 1864). Due to the number produced, smaller pepperbox pistols are common on the secondary market in a wide spectrum of condition. The Dragoon model noted below is quite rare, and commands a premium even in scruffy condition. Please see the cited work for extensive descriptions, illustrations, and a wide variety of photographs. \n\n6-Barrel PepperBox Pistols\n\nOnly six-barrel pepperbox pistols were produced during the Grafton and Norwich periods (1837–1847), and all had smooth barrel external contours until the later Worchester and Allen and Wheelock period, when fluted barrels became the norm. Six-barrel pepperboxes usually had a standard trigger, but some examples have a ring trigger. Most were double-action with the iconic 'bar hammer', but some were single-action with standard hammers. While simplifying shooting (no manual cocking of the hammer), the bar hammer did preclude the inclusion of usable sights. However, this early example of a double-action pistol must have been quite a selling point. As these were considered 'point and shoot' short range defensive weapons or 'belly guns', the market did not seem to object to the limitation of not having sights. Barrel length varied between three and six inches. There were four frame sizes, accommodating various calibers. Most common were .32 and .34 caliber, though the .28 and .30 caliber 'pocket size' have been reported. The 'Dragoon' model was the king, typically sporting six-inch barrels and .36 caliber. Except for early models and later Allen and Wheelock era production, most have beautiful engraving on the frame. \n5-Barrel PepperBox Pistols\n\nIt was during the Worchester period that the five-shot pepperbox was introduced. Percussion nipples were integrated to the barrels. It would have been expensive to make the machining, but likely reduced production cost significantly. Made with a bar hammer and standard trigger, models have been encountered with or without an integral nipple shield. .32 Was the most common caliber. The five barrel is relatively rare compared to the six barrel models\n\n4-Barrel PepperBox Pistols\n\nThe four-shot pepperbox was introduced during the Allen and Wheelock era, highlighting that the pepperbox was still an important design through the end of the 1850s. A patent dated 1857 shows that the four-shot barrel assembly attached to the frame in a different manner than the six and five-shot pepperboxes. Standard caliber was .34. All of the pictures this author has seen do not show a nipple shield.\n\nBar-Hammer Percussion Revolver \n\nThe bar-hammer revolver is an interested type. It is uncertain when production began or ended. The 1845 patent on the bar-hammer is the same as on the pepperbox and some single shot pistol models. It is likely some number of years after 1845 before this type was produced. A patent for (oddly enough) Rollin White was issued in 1858 that pictured a modified Allen bar-hammer revolver. This would seem to indicate that production started no later than 1856–1857. However, it is possible that production started several years earlier. Production almost certainly ended before the end of the Wheelock era (c 1864). This is based on no more than the logic of simplifying production. In 1861, it is possible that Allen produced the bar-hammer, side-hammer, and center-hammer percussion revolvers as well as the rimfire and lipfire cartridge revolvers simultaneously! Because demand from the Civil War was consuming just about any arm produced, it would have made sense to cease production of the less advanced models. The lineage of the pepperbox is clear in the cylinder design, grip design, standard-style trigger, and patented bar hammer double-action design. This may represent simple design evolution, as the double action pepperbox 'pocket pistols' were very popular in the market. Allen may have been counting on visual and functional design similarity to help sell these revolvers. The design may also be very thoughtful in regards to avoiding patent issues. By incorporating his unchallenged 1845 patent for the bar-hammer double-action mechanism, Allen may have wished to avoid any patent infringement problems from Colt for his own revolving mechanism IF the revolver was produced before the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. Considering all of the evidence that Allen was a thoughtful and frugal businessman, it may simply demonstrate that using common parts was less expensive than designing new ones. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard, though ivory could be had for an extra cost. The Allen bar-hammer is actually quite advanced in that pulling the trigger advances the cylinder, cocks the hammer and drops the hammer, firing the weapon. The cylinder can be removed for cleaning with the removal of cylinder pin. A separate rammer would be needed for loading. It is likely that the cylinder would be removed for loading, so reloading under duress is not practical. The author finds these revolvers aesthetically pleasing and very practical for a pocket pistol. This style was manufactured and sold in three different sizes.\n\nLarge Frame Bar-Hammer Revolver \n\nThe large frame is a five-shot, .34 caliber revolver. The barrel is 3.5-4 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the 'belt-size' side-hammer percussion revolver, and a few examples have the frame surface finely engraved as well. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an 'early' and 'late' variation.\n\nMid-Size Frame Bar-Hammer Revolver\n\nThe mid-sized frame is a five-shot, .32 caliber revolver. The barrel is approximately 3 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the 'belt-size' side-hammer percussion revolver, and a few examples have the frame surface finely engraved as well. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an 'early' and 'late' variation.\n\nSmall Frame Bar-Hammer Revolver\nThe small frame is a five-shot, .28 caliber revolver, though some .30 caliber models are known. The barrel is 2.5 inches long. The cylinder is engraved with a scene of forest animals identical to the 'pocket-size' side-hammer percussion revolver. As with many models, changes were made during production, and collectors note an 'early' and 'late' variation.\n\nSide-Hammer Percussion Revolver \n\nThe author has found the side-hammer models to be the most interesting of all of the Allen revolvers. Allen's design was clearly influenced by Colt's 1855 'Root' revolver, adopting the top strap above the cylinder for strength, rigidity and thus accuracy, and the side-hammer rather than the center hammer more usual on the Colt models 1847, 1848, 1849 and 1851. Another 'borrowed' feature was that the cylinder pin unscrewed from the rear, which the author finds far superior to the various methods of removing to the fore of the pistol. Though influenced by this near contemporary, Allen attempted to build the 'better mousetrap' by incorporating several unique and patented design features. One change was to retain standard trigger used in the bar-hammer revolvers rather than Root's spur trigger. The most interesting new feature is the combination trigger guard / loading lever. Unlike Colts, Remingtons, and other percussion revolvers that aligned a lever to load the cylinders under the barrel, Allen designed his revolvers to incorporate the trigger guard for this function. A catch is tripped, and the trigger guard and attached arm swing down to push a rammer into the bottom cylinder, thus seating the ball fully into the chamber. This reduced the number of parts, and likely cost of manufacture. This patented, unique feature carried on into the later center-hammer percussion models. There were four distinct cylinders, varying in the machining. All models are single action. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard. Ivory or silver grips could be had for an additional cost. Though manufactured in much smaller numbers than the Colts, Remingtons, Starr and other revolvers of the Civil War, Allen and Wheelock revolvers are clearly visible in many pictures of the era. The dates of manufacture are uncertain, possibly beginning as early as the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. This is supported by a patent granted to Allen in January 1857 covering the loading lever as described. As frugal as Allen was, it is unlikely that production would have ended prior to the consumption of all parts, even though the new center-hammer percussion were also being produced. It is unlikely that production survived the end of the Wheelock era (c 1864)\n\nNavy Model Side-hammer Revolver\n\nThe Navy model is a six-shot, .36 caliber weapon. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. The Navy model used the first and fourth cylinder type, which is inches long. Barrels were available in six and eight inch lengths. Although there are many small variations, there are no essential design changes. There are no known government contracts, though the Army Ordnance Department did purchase 338 on the open market.\n\nBelt Model Side-hammer Revolver\n\nThe Belt model is a five-shot, .32 caliber weapon. As the patent shows a five-shot pistol, it is likely that the belt model was the first produced. There are some examples in .31 and .34 caliber. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. Standard barrel lengths included 4, 5, 6 and inch. The Belt model used the second, third and fourth cylinder type, which was inches long. Three different model variations are generally accepted.\n\nPocket Model Side-hammer Revolver \n\nThe Pocket model is a five-shot, .28 caliber weapon. The cylinder is beautifully engraved with a scene of forest animals. The pocket model only used the fourth cylinder type, which was 1 9/16 inches long. Standard barrel length is four inches. Three different model variations are generally accepted by collectors.\n\nCenter-Hammer Percussion Revolver \n\nThe center-hammer percussion models bear a striking resemblance to the larger lipfire revolvers. All were single action. Ethan Allen showed much evidence of being astute and frugal, and the design likely evolved as a way to share between a percussion series and the new lipfire weapons. Why would Allen make percussion arms at all when the more advanced cartridge revolvers were available? The oft-referenced patent lawsuit may have caused Allen to 'hedge his bets' in case he lost, and would have to cease production of cartridge revolvers (as happened in 1863). It may be that cartridge firearms were a new and uncertain technology. A conservative market, as epitomized by the US Army Ordnance Department, were buying the established technology percussion weapons by the thousand. Even Smith and Wesson failed to obtain a government contract during the war for their cartridge revolvers. In any event, the center-hammer percussion revolvers were likely seen as a replacement for the side-hammer and possibly bar-hammer revolvers in production. As with many Allen arms, the start date of manufacture is uncertain. With patent dates including 1857, 1858, 1860, and 1861, many have posed that this revolver was not made until after the settlement of the patent lawsuit in 1863. However, records indicate that the US Ordnance Department purchase about 200 from a Boston merchant in December 1861. Perhaps 1860 or early 1861 is accurate. Advertised and marketed to the military, the center-hammer was designed to be stronger and more rugged than the side-hammer revolver. In addition to the stronger frame, the cylinder pin access was moved to the front of the cylinder. The center-hammer revolvers retained the innovative combination trigger guard/loading lever of the side-hammer models.\n\nArmy Model Revolver \n\nThe Army Model is a six-shot, .44 caliber percussion weapon with a standard inch barrel. There is an early and late production variant recognized by collectors. Finish would be blued, with standard wood grips. Production likely continued until the end of Allen's life. Approximately 750 are thought to have been made. Only a few examples are known which have been converted to cartridge. A fine 'custom' nickel Army with extensive engraving by Gustav and hand-carved ivory grips is thought to have been the personal weapon of Ethan Allen. This model is pretty beefy, larger and heavier than the contemporary Colt Model 1860 Army.\n\nNavy Model Revolver \n\nThe Navy Model is a six-shot, .36 caliber percussion weapon with a standard 5, 6 or inch barrel. There is an early and late production variant recognized by collectors. Detail design of variations would seem to indicated that the Navy followed the Army by some margin of time. Finish would be blued, with standard wood grips. Production likely continued until the end of Allen's life. Approximately 500 are thought to have been made. Only a few examples are known which have been converted to cartridge.\n\nProvidence Police Model Revolver \n\nThis model is an anomaly which has bedeviled collectors for years. It is unmarked, but has some distinctive design features patented by Allen. It is a five-shot .36 caliber weapon with samples including 3, 4 and 5 inch barrels. It is a bit of a throwback, without a loading lever and sporting a spur trigger. Known examples had a blue finish and wood grips. There are records indicating purchase by the Providence Rhode Island police department, hence the name commonly attributed to this model. It is possible that this was a specific contract, and the model was never marketed to the public. This may indicate production very late into the E Allen and Company era shortly before Allen's death. His sons-in-law Forehand and Wadsworth may have deemed an obsolescent percussion pistol unworthy of bringing into the inventory of the company now sporting their names, and discontinued the model after that initial run.\n\nLike many other arms makers, Ethan Allen saw the bored-through cylinder allowing for rear loading of self-contained metallic cartridges as the wave of the future. Unfortunately, the patent holder Rollin White, had sold exclusive rights to this innovation to Smith and Wesson, preventing other companies from making firearms leveraging the bored through cylinder. This legal constraint proved no barrier to Ethan Allen, who made two different rimfire revolvers that hit the market possibly as early as 1857—simultaneous to the Smith and Wesson model 1. As a holder of many patents, it is unlikely that Ethan Allen was ignorant of patent law—he simply chose to ignore it. Perhaps, he reckoned that he could outlast the upstart Smith and Wesson in legal maneuvering. He soon invented the 'lipfire' cartridge, a modified rimfire that only held the priming compound in approximately 1/8th of the circumference of the base of the cartridge. This made the cartridge base much stronger, as early rimfire cartridges had a tendency to split at the base, causing extraction malfunction. It was also more economical, as only 1/8th of the expensive fulminate was required. Ethan Allen then invented manufacturing equipment for metallic cartridges that far exceeded the competition in quality and efficiency. Allen was awarded a patent for the lipfire cartridge. Production of lipfire revolvers likely began around 1859. With the coming of the Civil War, Allen likely smelled immense profits for his 'better mousetrap'. However, the conservative procurement agents of the US Government awarded only small contracts—likely not trusting the technology or the supply of cartridges. By 1863, Rollin White finally won his patent infringement lawsuit, and production of all Allen and Wheelock cartridge revolvers ceased.\n\nRimfire Revolvers \n\n22 Caliber Rimfire Revolver\n\nThis is the first cartridge revolver made by Allen and Wheelock, and one of the first cartridge revolvers from any manufacturer (competing with the Smith and Wesson model 1). It is a single-action seven-shot revolver in .22 Rimfire (black powder equivalent of the modern .22 Short). It features the side-hammer of the early percussion revolvers and a spur trigger. Empty cases were removed by removing the cylinder, and using the cylinder pin to push the case out of the cylinder. There are many variations typically organized into six models, though all share the size and critical design features. Most were made with a 3-inch barrel. The first through fourth models have engraved cylinders, with crossed rifles, a horse and rider, military articles, an Indian with bow and a sailing ship. Allen obtained a patent granted in 1858, and it is likely that production began in 1857. Production continued until 1863, when production of all cartridge revolvers was halted by the lawsuit described previously. Production resumed upon expiry of the Rollin White patent in 1869, though likely from parts manufactured in the earlier period. After Allen's death in 1871, production continued for some period under the new company name Forehand and Wadsworth.\n\n32 Caliber Rimfire Revolver \n\nFollowing the introduction of the 22 Rimfire, Allen and Wheelock introduced the larger .32 Caliber Rimfire. Stronger to accommodate the more powerful cartridge, the .32 caliber followed the design cues of the .22 in being a single-action, spur trigger revolver. The cylinder accommodated six cartridges, and barrels could be had in either three, four, or five inch lengths. Engraving on the cylinder was a country scenes with dogs chasing a rabbit. There are three 'models' with detail improvements, though the basic design remained unchanged. Cylinder, and consequently frame, length grew from .905 inch to .940 inch to 1.2 inches. Production likely began in 1858, and ceased in 1863 per the patent suit described above. Production, or at least assembly, resumed presumably at the expiration of the Rollin White patent as a catalog from 1871 offers them at $9.25. A patent was granted 1860 to reduce drag on the recoil shield applied to this revolver as well as the lipfire revolvers. A later patent with a simplified action was granted in 1861. With the solid frame design, these revolvers were far stronger than the contemporary Smith and Wesson Model 2. In fact, the author would challenge that the design is much more sophisticated than the contemporary Smith & Wesson. Though it cannot be confirmed, it likely beat the Smith & Wesson Model 2 to market.\n\nLipfire Revolvers \n\nEthan Allen was granted a patent in September 1861 for his .44 caliber lipfire revolver. As this is more than a year since his patent on the lipfire cartridge, it is possible that lipfire revolvers were produced in late 1860 or early 1861. As many incomplete revolvers and parts would have been in existence at the time of the 'cease and desist' court order from the patent infringement in 1863, this inventory was kept and these revolvers were reintroduced when the White patent expired in 1869 until the parts stocks were depleted. All of the Allen and Wheelock lipfire revolvers were single-action. Many of the lipfire weapons were converted to rimfire with the simple machining/removal of just a small amount on the rear face of the cylinder as supplies of the ill-fated lipfire cartridge dwindled. While it is not known for certain, some of these conversions may have occurred at the factory, especially for those assembled in or after 1869. Others were converted by any number of gunsmiths around the country. It should be noted that the Army model was the first 'large bore' (more than .40 caliber) cartridge revolver, and remained so until the Remington cartridge conversions of the model 1858 appeared in 1868—soon followed by the cartridge-designed Smith & Wesson Model 3 in 1869. Similarly, the Navy model was the only .36 caliber cartridge revolver until the similar conversion of Colt models 1851, 1861 & 1862 following the expiry of the Rollin White patent. \n\n44 Caliber Lipfire Revolver\n\nThe 44 was the first lipfire revolver produced. It sports a six-shot cylinder. Similar in appearance to the center-hammer percussion revolver, the rack and pinion mechanism of the loading level is hijacked to provide a cartridge case removal plunger. Thus the trigger guard pivots to actuate the plunger, as the center-hammer percussion revolver used the trigger guard to ram the load into the cylinder. Four variants are recognized, with 'narrow' and 'common' width grips and top vs. bottom hinges on the loading gate highlighting the difference. Standard barrel length was a massive 8 inches long, with the breadth and heft of the Army model center hammer percussion pistols.\n\n36 Caliber Lipfire Revolver \n\nVery similar in design to the 44 caliber lipfire, this revolver was 'downsized' slightly and chambered in 36 caliber. The cylinder has a six-shot capacity. As with the similar sized center-hammer percussion, barrel lengths were produced in 5, 6, and 8 inch to accommodate different tastes. No significant variants are recognized, which may indicate that the .36 followed the .44 after the .44 design gestation.\n\n32 Caliber Lipfire Revolver\n\nThe 32 lipfire sports a six-shot cylinder in the smaller caliber. The design of the .32 caliber lipfire breaks from its bigger brothers in several important ways. Firstly, it sports a spur trigger rather than using the standard trigger with guard. Secondly, it uses a side-hammer of earlier design. Lastly, it ditches the trigger guard ejector/plunger for a weaker left-mounted plunger with rack and pinion gears to the top and left of the chamber. In design, it seems to be a marriage/compromise between its bigger brothers and the earlier .32 Rimfire revolver. Barrel lengths include 4, 5 and 6 inch.\n\n25 Caliber Lipfire Revolver\n\nMade without a loading gate or ejection mechanism, the .25 caliber lipfire is still another unique design. To load or unload, this seven-shot pocket gun required the cylinder to be removed to load or unload the cylinder. With just a few exceptions, most of the .25 caliber revolvers carry no markings. It is speculated that these may have been very late to market before the loss of the patent suit as a 'spit in your eye' gesture to Smith and Wesson. A 3-inch barrel was standard.\n\nSingle Shot Rimfire Pistols\n\nWith single-shot percussion pistols still selling well, it was natural that Allen would adopt cartridges to this style of pistol. A single-shot cartridge pistol also did not infringe on the Rollin White patent as described above.\n\n22 Caliber Rimfire Side Swing Pistol\n\n32 Caliber Rimfire Side Swing Pistol\n\n"}

{"id": "33491633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33491633", "title": "Hollis E. Roberts", "text": "Hollis E. Roberts\n\nHollis Earl Roberts (May 9, 1943 – October 19, 2011) was a Native American politician whose career was highlighted by his 19-year period as chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Hollis Roberts was born in Hochatown to Laura Beam Roberts and Darrell E. Roberts. He attended Holly Creek Elementary and Idabel High School, graduating in 1961. Roberts married Helen R. Rodriguez in 1963. They had three children: two boys and one girl. Following his political career, Roberts died on October 19, 2011 at 68 years of age.\n\nRoberts remains an extremely polarizing and controversial figure among Native Americans. His 19-year reign as Chief of the Choctaw Nation came to end in 1997 amid convictions of sexual contact and sexual abuse. From these convictions (leading to an eleven-year prison sentence and removal from office), to his then-extravagant $120,000 per year salary, to his alleged corruption; all have led to a negative public opinion of Roberts. Nevertheless, he served for 19 years as chief of the one of the largest Native American tribes in the United States. He governed well over 195,000 members, including over 79,000 in Oklahoma.\n\nRoberts began his political career as a city council person in Hugo City where he served for 14 years. Hugo is a town within the Choctaw Reservation in Oklahoma. Following his time in Hugo, Roberts served six years in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, representing Choctaw County. Choctaw county was only six per cent Indians, making his dramatic victory that much more captivating. Following his time as a member of the Oklahoma House Representative, Roberts served from 1975-1978 as Choctaw Chief David Gardner’s assistant.\n\nFollowing the 1978 death of Chief David Gardner, Hollis Roberts was elected chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. His election into office came at the tail end of the Red Power movement. As a young, energetic, and charismatic leader, Roberts embodied much of the Red Power Movement and became a guiding voice for change at a time when Indian sovereignty was at a countrywide high. Roberts ran against political rival Charles Brown. Brown was a popular, but older politician, who was well respected by Choctaws. Roberts won in a tight election, winning by only 339 votes.\n\n1983 was big year for both Roberts and the Choctaw. Roberts proposed a new constitution to the Choctaw people. A major component of this new constitution was the removal of blood quantum for tribal membership, which effectively increased the number of members of the Choctaw tribe. The new constitution did not come without controversy; while there was no minimum blood quantum for tribal membership, there was an enforced blood quantum of ¼ to be elected to tribal office. Additionally, women were given the right to vote with the new constitution. This new constitution was voted in 2,253 to 780 on July 9, 1983. As chief, it was Roberts job to appoint tribal judges. In 1983 Roberts appointed Juanita Jefferson, the first female Choctaw judge. Roberts was reelected in 1983. \n1992 was another big year: in '92 the Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes signed a compact with State of Oklahoma. This compact equates to Indians paying a fee to the federal government each year instead of paying taxes on tobacco products sold to non-natives on their reservations. The end result was that the Choctaw paid 75% less to the federal government and were thus able to increase their profit on products sold on the reservations. \nRoberts worked to improve health standards, increase the tribe's population, and promote a healthy economy. During his time in charge, tuberculosis and infant mortality rates among the Choctaw decreased dramatically. Roberts effectively used his influence and abilities to negotiate federal funding and to set up programs for his people. \nUnder his reign, the Choctaw Nation improved health standards, saw an increase in population, and set forth intensive economic growth campaigns. Today many view Roberts as a criminal, but in his heyday many also viewed him as a charismatic politician who brought much needed change to the Choctaw.\n\nOn June 6, 1997, Roberts’ time as chief came to an end following his conviction in a federal court in Muskogee, Ok. Roberts was convicted on two counts of sexual contact and one count of aggravated sexual abuse involving two female employees of the tribe. The aggravated sexual abuse count carried a possible life sentence; however, he was eventually sentenced to eleven years in prison. The jury acquitted Mr. Roberts on four similar counts, three of them involving a former tribal employee who testified that Mr. Roberts had raped her. Hollis Roberts attempted an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on sexual-abuse convictions and his 11-year prison sentence, but lost both appeals. One of his appeals was that the U.S. District Court lacked jurisdiction where the assaults took place because they happened in Tribal complex property which was trust land and thus not Indian Country nor formally a part of the reservation. The government ruled against this appeal claiming that the federal government owned the land in trust for Indians and it was thus Indian Country. Roberts also argued that he should not have an enhanced sentence for abusing a position of trust.\n\n"}
{"id": "15088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15088", "title": "Isaiah", "text": "Isaiah\n\nIsaiah was the 8th-century BC Jewish prophet for whom the Book of Isaiah is named. \n\nWithin the text of the Book of Isaiah, Isaiah himself is referred to as \"the prophet\", but the exact relationship between the Book of Isaiah and any such historical Isaiah is complicated. The traditional view is that all 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah were written by one man, Isaiah, possibly in two periods between 740 BCE and c. 686 BCE, separated by approximately 15 years, and includes dramatic prophetic declarations of Cyrus the Great in the Bible, acting to restore the nation of Israel from Babylonian captivity. Another widely-held view is that parts of the first half of the book (chapters 1–39) originated with the historical prophet, interspersed with prose commentaries written in the time of King Josiah a hundred years later, and that the remainder of the book dates from immediately before and immediately after the end of the exile in Babylon, almost two centuries after the time of the historic prophet.\n\nThe first verse of the Book of Isaiah states that Isaiah prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah (). Uzziah's reign was 52 years in the middle of the 8th century BCE, and Isaiah must have begun his ministry a few years before Uzziah's death, probably in the 740s BCE. Isaiah lived until the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign (who died 698 BCE). He may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for as long as 64 years.\n\nAccording to some modern interpretations, Isaiah's wife was called \"the prophetess\" (), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah () and Huldah (), or simply because she was the \"wife of the prophet\". They had two sons, naming one Shear-jashub, meaning \"A remnant shall return\" (), and the younger, Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, meaning, \"Spoil quickly, plunder speedily\" ().\nSoon after this, Shalmaneser V determined to subdue the kingdom of Israel, taking over and destroying Samaria (722 BCE). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was untouched by the Assyrian power. But when Hezekiah gained the throne, he was encouraged to rebel \"against the king of Assyria\" (), and entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt (). The king of Assyria threatened the king of Judah, and at length invaded the land. Sennacherib (701 BC) led a powerful army into Judah. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians (). But after a brief interval, war broke out again. Again Sennacherib led an army into Judah, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem (; ). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he \"spread before the LORD\" ().\n\nAccording to the account in 2 Kings 19 (and its derivative account in 2 Chronicles 32) an angel of God fell on the Assyrian army and 185,000 of its men were killed in one night. \"Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either the Southern Levant or Egypt.\"\n\nThe remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful (). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh. The time and manner of his death are not specified in either the Bible or other primary sources. The Talmud [Yevamot 49b] says that he suffered martyrdom by being sawn in two under the orders of Manasseh. According to rabbinic literature, Isaiah was the maternal grandfather of Manasseh.\n\nSome writers assert that Isaiah was a vegetarian, on the basis of passages in the Book of Isaiah that extol nonviolence and reverence for life, such as Isaiah 1:11, 11:6-9, 65:25, and 66:3. Some of these writers refer to \"the vegetarian Isaiah\", \"the notorious vegetarian Isaiah\", and \"Isaiah, the vegetarian prophet\".\n\nThe book of Isaiah, along with the book of Jeremiah, is distinctive in the Hebrew bible for its direct portrayal of the \"wrath of the Lord\" as presented, for example, in Isaiah 9:19 stating, \"Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire.\"\n\nThe Ascension of Isaiah, a pseudegraphical Christian text dated to sometime between the end of the 1st century to the beginning of the 3rd, gives a detailed story of Isaiah confronting an evil false prophet and ending with Isaiah being martyred – none of which is attested in the original Biblical account. \n\nGregory of Nyssa (c. 335–395), believed that the Prophet Isaiah \"knew more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel\". Jerome (c. 342–420) also lauds the Prophet Isaiah, saying, \"He was more of an Evangelist than a Prophet, because he described all of the Mysteries of the Church of Christ so vividly that you would assume he was not prophesying about the future, but rather was composing a history of past events.\" Of specific note are the songs of the Suffering Servant, which Christians say are a direct prophetic revelation of the nature, purpose, and detail of the death of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Book of Isaiah is quoted many times by New Testament writers. Ten of those references are about the Suffering Servant, how he will suffer and die to save many from their sins, be buried in a rich man's tomb, and be a light to the Gentiles. The Gospel of John says that Isaiah \"saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.\"\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Isaiah the Prophet on May 9.\n\nThe Book of Mormon quotes Jesus Christ as stating that \"great are the words of Isaiah\", and that all things prophesied by Isaiah have been and will be fulfilled. The Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants also quote Isaiah more than any other prophet from the Old Testament. Additionally, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints consider the founding of the church by Joseph Smith in the 19th century to be a fulfillment of Isaiah 11, the translation of the Book of Mormon to be a fulfillment of Isaiah 29, and the building of Latter-day Saint temples as a fulfillment of Isaiah 2:2.\n\nAlthough Isaiah, or his Arabic name أشعياء (transliterated: \"Ashiʻyā), are not mentioned by name in the Qur'an or the Hadith, Muslim sources have accepted him as a prophet. Some Muslim scholars, such as Ibn Kathir and Kisa'i, reproduced Jewish traditions regarding Isaiah, which were transmitted through early Jewish converts to Islam. Isaiah is mentioned as a prophet in Ibn Kathir's \"Story of Prophet Isaiah\", and the modern writers Muhammad Asad and Abdullah Yusuf Ali accepted Isaiah as a true Hebrew prophet, who preached to the Israelites following the death of King David. Isaiah is well known in Muslim exegesis and literature, notably for his predictions of the coming of Jesus and Muhammad. Isaiah's narrative in Muslim literature can be divided into three sections. The first establishes Isaiah as a prophet of Israel during the reign of Hezekiah; the second relates Isaiah's actions during the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib; and the third warns the nation of coming doom.\n\nMuslim exegesis preserves a tradition parallel to the Hebrew Bible, which states that Hezekiah was king in Jerusalem during Isaiah's time. Hezekiah heard and obeyed Isaiah's advice, but could not quell the turbulence in Israel. This tradition maintains that Hezekiah was a righteous man and that the turbulence worsened after him. After the death of the king, Isaiah told the people not to forsake God, and he warned Israel to cease from its persistent sin and disobedience. Muslim tradition maintains that the unrighteous of Israel in their anger sought to kill Isaiah. In a death that resembles that attributed to Isaiah in \"Lives of the Prophets\", Muslim exegesis recounts that Isaiah was martyred by Israelites by being sawn in two.\n\nIn the courts of Al-Ma'mun, the seventh Abbasid caliph, Ali al-Ridha, the great grandson of Muhammad and prominent scholar (Imam) of his era, was questioned by the High Jewish Rabbi to prove the prophethood of both Jesus and Muhammad through the Torah. Among his several proofs, the Imam references the Book of Isaiah , stating \"Sha‘ya (Isaiah), the Prophet, said in the Torah concerning what you and your companions say: ‘I have seen two riders to whom (He) illuminated earth. One of them was on a donkey and the other was on a camel.’ Who is the rider of the donkey, and who is the rider of the camel?” to which the Rabbi was unable to answer with certainty. Al-Ridha clarifies that \"As for the rider of the donkey, he is ‘Isa (Jesus); and as for the rider of the camel, he is Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family. Do you deny that this (statement) is in the Torah?” to which the Rabbi responds \"No, I do not deny it.\" \n\nAccording to the rabbinic literature, Isaiah was a descendant of the royal house of Judah and Tamar (Sotah 10b). He was the son of Amoz (not to be confused with Prophet Amos), who was the brother of King Amaziah of Judah. (Talmud tractate Megillah 15a).\n\n\n"}

He often represented Refugio County during statewide conventions. Was part of the Mexican national era\n\nPower was born either in 1788 or 1789 at the small rural village of Ballygarrett in County Wexford, Ireland. In 1809, he relocated to New Orleans, where he labored as a merchant for the next twelve years. During his time in New Orleans, Power met with Stephen F. Austin, who notified him of the land grant (empresario) offerings from the Mexican government. Hoping to cash in on the opportunity, he moved to Saltillo via Matamoros in 1821, and became a citizen of Mexico. During his stay in Saltillo, he was employed in the mining equipment industry and entered into a partnership with merchant and fellow Irishman James Hewetson.\n\nAfter forming the partnership, Power and Hewetson applied for an empresario with the Mexican government in 1825 to begin a colony on the Texas coast with Mexican and Irish families. The original 1826 application requested for a grant between the Nueces and Sabine Rivers, but in 1828, the Mexican government instead offered the strip of land between the Guadalupe and Lavaca Rivers. The next year, Power and Hewetson requested more land and their holdings were extended west to the Nueces River, which included Nuestra Señora del Refugio Mission. Ownership disputes with other empresarios forced Power and Hewetson to cede some land east of the Guadalupe River and the new eastern boundary was drawn at Coleto Creek.\n\nIn 1833, Power returned to Ireland and searched for potential settlers of his colony. He convinced 350 individuals to travel with him to Texas to begin a settlement with promises of large plots of land. The immigrants traveled in two group with the first scheduled to land in New Orleans in April and the next scheduled for May. After the first group arrived in New Orleans, many of the settlers were struck with cholera and died. An additional lot were infected with cholera during the voyage from New Orleans to Texas, and died at the landing in Copano. These who survived either remained in Copano or traveled to the Refugio Mission, where they formed a settlement with Mexican colonists. In 1835, Hewetson sold his share of the empresario to Power and returned to Mexico. The land claims were eventually deemed invalid by the new Republic of Texas and designated as property of the state.\n\nPower became involved in the struggle for Texas Independence around 1835, and was a part of the Lipantitlán expedition that led to the Battle of Lipantitlán. He also was present at the Convention of 1836 and signed the Texas Declaration of Independence as a representative of Refugio County. During the convention, he convinced his fellow members to seat Sam Houston as President, and helped draft the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. Afterwards, he was sent to New Orleans to retrieve supplies for the Texas army, and assisted the ultimate victory.\n\nIn 1837, Power partnered with former Texas Governor Henry Smith to establish the settlement of Aransas City near Power's home on Live Oak Peninsula, just north of present-day Fulton. He established a post office, wharf and customhouse at the site, which grew into a valued port and settlement of about 500 people. Power served as the town's first mayor following incorporation in 1839. However, the town declined after Lamar was established nearby, and President Mirabeau B. Lamar, a political opponent of Sam Houston, whom Power supported, decided to strip Aransas City of its customhouse and present it to Lamar.\n\nPower served on the Second Congress for Refugio County during the 1845 Convention that decided to approve the United States' annexation of Texas.\n\nIn 1832, Power married Dolores de la Portilla, the daughter of Spanish colonizer Felipe Roque de la Portilla, and had two children. He later married his wife's sister following her death, and had five additional children.\n\nPower died on August 15, 1852, and was buried near his house, but was later diagnosed with explosive diarrea at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Refugio. The site of his house, the first lot plotted in incorporated Refugio, was designated as a historical landmark in 1936. This house, known as the Ballygarrett House, is currently owned by Dagoberto and Barbara Gonzalez.\n"}

A member of the Democratic Party, he was one of the signatories of the Confederate States Constitution.\n\nHemphill's father was a Presbyterian minister, The Reverend John Hemphill, who emigrated to the United States from County Londonderry, northern Ireland. His mother, Jane Lind, was also Scots-Irish but was born in Pennsylvania, where they met and married. John Hemphill the younger was born in South Carolina. He was educated at Jefferson College, graduating in 1825. He studied or \"read the law\" with David McCloud and was admitted to the bar in South Carolina in 1829. Several years later, in 1838 Hemphill moved his practice to Texas after it became an independent republic. Realizing that it was strongly influenced by Spanish law, he learned Spanish and studied its laws in order to be successful in this new environment.\n\nA friend of Sam Houston, Hemphill was appointed and served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas from 1841 to 1846 and of the Supreme Court of Texas from 1846 to 1858, serving as the top jurist in the Republic of Texas and then in the State of Texas. During this period, Texas was an independent republic and then a state in the United States before the Civil War.\n\nHe was called the 'John Marshall' of Texas for the role he played in the development of Texan law from the republic's early years, \"laying the foundation of its judiciary system.\" The challenges were far beyond the law; Hemphill became known for an incident in which he fought Indian warriors who had attacked him in a courtroom while his court was in session.\n\nHemphill was considered an expert on Spanish and Mexican law, and he considered Spanish civil law to be superior to common law in many areas, especially in relation to property. He is remembered for expanding women's rights so that women could inherit equally. He also supported homestead rights in an adoption of principles of Spanish civil law. Hemphill was elected in 1858 to replace Sam Houston as United States senator from Texas when Houston would not support the right of states to secede from the United States. He served from 1859 to 1861.\n\nAs Texas was one of the first seven states to secede from the Union, Hemphill was among the fourteen United States senators expelled by Congressional resolution in 1861. He was subsequently chosen as a Texas delegate to the Provisional Confederate Congress, a position he held until his death in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nHemphill never married. He lived with his slave Sabina for more than a decade and had two daughters with her. He arranged for their education, sending them in the late 1850s to the newly founded Wilberforce College in Ohio, considered a \"training ground\" for abolitionists before the Civil War. John Hemphill was a cousin of Charles Hare Hemphill, Lord Hemphill through his father, The Reverend John Hemphill.\n\nHemphill and Hemphill County, Texas, are named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

(, or Mary of Jesus Crucified, 5 January 1846 – 26 August 1878), was a Discalced Carmelite nun of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. Born to Greek Catholic parents from Syria and Lebanon, she was known for her service to the poor. In addition, she became a Christian mystic who suffered the stigmata, and has been canonized by the Catholic Church.\n\nHer path to canonization solidified on 6 December 2014 with the recognition of a final miracle needed for her canonization. In the consistory of 14 February 2015, Pope Francis announced that she would be canonized on 17 May 2015; she was canonized at the Vatican.\n\nShe was born on 5 January 1846 (the eve of Epiphany) in the Galilean village of I'billin, the region of Southern Syria in the Ottoman Empire, now in Israel, to Giries (George) Baouardy and his wife, Mariam Chahine, both of Damascene ancestry. Mariam was their 13th child and first daughter, and none of her preceding brothers had survived infancy. She was born after the couple made a pilgrimage on foot to Bethlehem, some 70 miles away, out of desperation after the loss of their children. When they were later blessed with the birth of a daughter, they named her after the Virgin Mary, out of gratitude. She was joined by a new brother, Boulos, two years later.\n\nMariam was not yet three years old when both her parents died from an illness in 1848, only a few days apart. The siblings were then each taken in by relatives on different sides of her family living in different villages, she being taken in by a paternal uncle who lived in the same village, and her brother went to live with a maternal aunt. The brother and sister would never see one another again. She was raised in a loving home in comfortable circumstances. As a child she had a marked spirit of religious fervor, and at the age of five began to fast on Saturdays in honor of the Blessed Virgin.\n\nWhen Baouardy was eight, her uncle and his wife moved to Alexandria, Egypt, to improve their situation. Five years later, in 1858 when she was aged 13, in keeping with tradition, she was engaged by her uncle to his wife's brother, who lived in Cairo. The night before the wedding, she had a religious experience in which she felt called not to marry but to offer her life to God. Upon being told this the following morning, her uncle flew into a rage and beat her severely. Despite this, and the subsequent ill treatment she began to experience from her uncle, she stayed firm in her decision.\n\nNonetheless, Baouardy felt depressed and alone. She wrote her brother, then living in Nazareth, asking him to visit her. The young male servant she asked to deliver the letter drew out of her the cause for her sadness. Upon learning of this, he attempted to woo her for himself, inviting her to convert to Islam. She rejected his proposal, which caused the young man to fly into a rage, in which he drew a knife and cut her throat. He then dumped her body in a nearby alley.\n\nBaouardy then experienced what she was convinced was a miracle. As she related later, a \"nun dressed in blue\" brought her to a grotto which she could never identify, stitched her wounds, and took care of her. Her voice was affected for the rest of her life as a result of the cut, which a French doctor later measured as being 10 cm. (nearly 4 inches) wide. After being cared for by this mysterious figure for a month, she recovered enough to leave and find work as a domestic servant in the home of an Arab Christian family in the city. \n\nAfter a year, Baourardy decided to try to meet her brother and traveled by caravan to Jerusalem. There she felt inspired to make a vow of perpetual virginity at the Holy Sepulchre. She then took a boat in Jaffa with the intention of heading to Acre. Due to poor weather, however, the boat had to stop at Beirut. Taking this as a sign from God, she disembarked and found work as a maid. After working there she suddenly became blind, a condition that lasted for 40 days, when just as suddenly she recovered her vision. Not long after that, she had a serious fall which seemed to leave her for dead. Her employer cared for her for a month until she recovered, completely healed.\n\nIn May 1863 a generous patron made it possible for Baouardy to move to Marseille, France, where she became the cook for an Arab family. While there, she felt called to enter a religious order. Rejected by the first groups to which she sought admission, in May 1865 she was accepted as a postulant by the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition, who had communities in the Holy Land and already had several Palestinian candidates. It was at this point that she received the stigmata of Christ.\n\nDuring the last month of this period of candidacy, the Mistress of novices, Mother Honorine who had drawn Baouardy's life story from her, was replaced by Mother Veronica of the Passion. After two years as a postulant, Baouardy was up for a vote by the community regarding her admission to the congregation. To her dismay, she was rejected by the Sisters charged with making the decision.\n\nAt that point, Mother Veronica had just received permission to transfer to the Discalced Carmelite monastery at Pau to prepare for her forming a new congregation of Religious Sisters serving in India, the Sisters of the Apostolic Carmel. She invited Baouardy to go with her, writing to the prioress of that community and recommending that they accept the young Arab woman. The prioress accepted Mother Veronica's advice and, in June 1867, both women went together to Pau, where they received the Carmelite religious habit and Baourdy was given the religious name of Mary of Jesus Crucified.\n\nIn 1870, Mariam went with the first group of Carmelite Apostolic Sisters to Mangalore, India. She served there for two years before returning to Pau. It was there she made her profession of solemn vows as a member of the Order in November 1871. In September 1875 she helped to found a new monastery in Bethlehem, the first of the Order in that region, where she lived until her death. During her whole life, she experienced periods of religious ecstasy frequently throughout the day.\n\nIn April 1878 Mariam played an important role in the identification of the Biblical Emmaus thanks to a private revelation. She died on 26 August 1878 in Bethlehem, from a cancer which had developed in her bones as a result of the fall she had while working in the monastery, which led to gangrene that spread to her lungs.\n\nThe cause of canonization started on 18 May 1927 and would culminate with the decree of heroic virtue on 27 November 1981. Sister Mary of Jesus Crucified was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 13 November 1983 and was canonized on 17 May 2015 by Pope Francis. She became the second Greek Catholic to be canonized a saint of the Catholic Church, the first being Saint Josaphat Kuntsevych in 1867.\n\nIn I'billin a kindergarten, the Miriam Bawardi Elementary School and a junior high school are named after Mariam Baouardy.\n\n\n"}

He moved to Mechanicsburg, Ohio with his father and attended college at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for a few years.\n\nLapham arrived in Texas in the middle of 1831, and he taught school at San Felipe, Texas. He lived in the household of Thomas H. Borden, while assisting Borden with surveying work for about a year. Lapham spent three years in Ohio. However, by December 1835, he had returned to Texas and resumed work as a surveyor.\n\nLapham enlisted in the Texas Army on February 23, 1836 and served as a scout. When General Sam Houston evacuated his troops from Gonzalez, Texas, Lapham one one of three sentinels who did not receive the orders. At one point, he was close enough to the advancing Mexican forces to be seen. Eventually he abandoned his post and fled to safety.\n\nIn 1836 he enlisted in the Texas army, was a member of Captain Moseley Baker's \"San Felipe Company\", and fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, where he was one of the men who destroyed Vince's Bridge. The others who were with him on that mission were Deaf Smith, John Coker, Dimer W. Reaves, Young Perry Alsbury, John T. Garner and Edwin R. Rainwater.\n\nAfter his release from the Army in the fall of 1836, Lapham rejoined Gail and Thomas Borden to work as a surveyor. He helped to lay out the new town of Houston, Texas in October 1836.\n\nLapham was later employed as a deputy surveyor by Samuel Maverick of San Antonio to survey land for him. The party of five, (Mr. Maverick, the sixth member had returned home was on October 20, 1838) was attacked by Comanche Indians on Leon Creek about four miles from San Antonio, Texas and Moses Lapham, Cornelius Skinner, a Mr. Jones, and one other of the party were killed. The surviving members returned to town and spread the news. Thirteen prominent men headed by Benjamin Franklin Cage, a San Jacinto veteran, hurriedly left San Antonio and went to the place where the massacre had occurred. The Indians, estimated at a hundred or more, surrounded the Texans and killed Captain Cage, Dr. Henry G. McClung, R. M. Lee, a Mr. O'Blye, Peter Conrad, John Pickering and a Mr. Green, and badly wounded General Richard Dunlap and Major William H. Patton. The next day a search party brought in the remains of the dead.

{"id": "9528678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9528678", "title": "Murder of Deborah Gardner", "text": "Murder of Deborah Gardner\n\nDeborah Gardner was a 23-year-old American Peace Corps volunteer who was murdered by another volunteer in the South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga in 1976. The handling of the subsequent trial of the killer brought much criticism upon the Peace Corps.\n\nGardner was a recent graduate of Washington State University when she joined the Peace Corps. After completing training, she was assigned to teach science and home economics to high school students in Nuku'alofa, the capital city of Tonga. There she met Dennis Priven, a Peace Corps volunteer who had come to Tonga the previous year. \n\nPriven became infatuated with Gardner, but she did not return his feelings. This became evident when Gardner accepted a dinner invitation from Priven. He had envisioned a romantic evening, but after he attempted to give Gardner an expensive gift, she left, saying she felt uncomfortable. Despite this, Priven continued to pursue her. Gardner tried to avoid him, going as far as requesting a transfer to another island. Priven, on the other hand, tried to get his Peace Corps service extended for another year so he could stay near Gardner. Tonga's Peace Corps director denied both requests.\n\nA few months before Priven's two-year Peace Corps service was completed, a party was held for all the volunteers on Tonga. Both Priven and Gardner attended. Many volunteers became intoxicated, including Gardner. She left the party with a male volunteer, who escorted her to her house. This was witnessed by Priven, who became jealous. Less than a week after the party, on October 14, 1976, Priven killed her.\n\nA local man heard screams coming from Gardner's house and rushed to the scene. He reported seeing Priven attempting to drag Gardner out of the house. As soon as Priven noticed the Tongan, he released Gardner and fled on bicycle. Gardner later died from 22 stab wounds, but not before she was able to name her assailant. Priven attempted suicide by taking Darvon and cutting his wrists, but changed his mind and sought out a friend to accompany him to the police to turn himself in. He was charged with murder and tried in Tonga.\n\nThe prosecutor claimed that Priven killed Gardner in anger over his rejection. At the trial Priven was represented by lawyer Clive Edwards, who would later become deputy Prime Minister of Tonga. A psychiatrist hired by the Peace Corps testified that Priven was schizophrenic, claiming to be Gardner's Jesus Christ and that Gardner was possessed by the devil. Priven was found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n\nDespite the verdict, the Tongan justice system was reluctant to release Priven. After receiving a letter from the U.S. State Department promising he would be involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, Tonga handed him over to the U.S. government. When he arrived in the U.S., however, Priven requested to be released and he was, as the government discovered it had no legal grounds to hold him. \n\nUnder pressure from his family and the Peace Corps, Priven ultimately agreed to a psychiatric evaluation. He was interviewed by a psychiatrist associated with the hospital where the government had intended him to serve his commitment. His diagnosis fit the prosecution's theory; Priven had suffered a \"situational psychosis\" after being rejected by Gardner. Since the diagnosis determined that Priven was not schizophrenic, he could not be committed. \n\nPriven returned to New York City after he was released and worked for the Social Security Administration until his retirement.\n\nThe Peace Corps has been criticized for its handling of the murder, particularly since a book on the case was published in 2005, acquainting a wider public with the details. Criticisms include that Priven's defense in Tonga was supplied by the Peace Corps, that the Peace Corps allegedly went to great efforts to bury the incident, and that Priven was not suffering from a psychiatric disorder that would have allowed him to mount a successful psychiatric defense in an American court.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Attorney's office in Seattle looked into the possibility of bringing charges against Dennis Priven for the murder of Deborah Gardner but concluded that Priven could not be tried in any jurisdiction in the United States. Although a 1994 law allows prosecutors to bring charges against an American citizen who kills another American citizen while overseas, and the PATRIOT Act allows US Courts to try Americans for crimes they may have committed while overseas, neither of these laws were in effect at the time the murder occurred in 1976 and they cannot therefore be applied retroactively to the Gardner murder case, the US Attorney's office concluded.\n\nAlthough Priven's psychiatrist at his trial in Tonga testified that Priven suffered from latent paranoid schizophrenia, a panel of psychiatrists who discussed the murder as a case study in 2005 concluded that Priven was probably suffering from narcissistic personality disorder, which manifests itself as an obsessive involvement with one’s own interests and a lack of empathy for others. They further concluded that had he been charged in an American court, he would not have been able to mount a successful defense \"by reason of insanity.\"\n\n"}

He is also known for being an \"outsider\" artist, whose pen-and-ink drawings and paintings have been shown in galleries worldwide. Blinko also creates all the drawings used by the band for its artwork.\nBlinko's first recorded musical project was the Magits, who formed in 1977 and were primarily electronic. This band's only record, the 1979 7\" EP \"Fully Coherent\", was the first release on Blinko's Outer Himalayan Records label, and received occasional airplay by John Peel on Radio 1.\n\nHis most well-known and longest running band, Rudimentary Peni, formed in 1980 and would go on to release three albums and six EPs spanning 1981-2009. A full-length collection of the first two EPs was also released in 1987.\n\nRudimentary Peni's concept album \"Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric\" was allegedly written while Blinko was being detained in a psychiatric hospital under Section 3 of the UK Mental Health Act 1983. The subject matter of the album was purported to be based on the delusions Blinko was experiencing at this time.\n\nBlinko has written and illustrated three books. The first, \"The Primal Screamer\", was a fictionalized semi-autobiographical novel with horror elements. It was published in 1995 by Spare Change Books and received a second printing in 2002. The book is written as a series of journal entries made by the therapist of \"Nathaniel Snoxell\" (who starts a band which is never named but is similar to Rudimentary Peni in many ways). This book was reprinted in 2011 by PM Press, and collected artwork used for several previous editions under one cover for the first time. The 2011 edition was distributed by the Alternative Tentacles label.\n\nBlinko's second book, \"Haunted Head\", was published in 2009 by David Tibet via Coptic Cat, in a limited edition of approximately 350 copies. An exclusive micro-edition of 60 copies was also published, featuring an original piece of art, while all copies of the book contained a postcard with a handwritten excerpt from the book. The edition size reflected the number of Blinko's handwritten postcards, from which the text of the book was transcribed, and which were included in the book. The book also included a one-track CD of a song by Rudimentary Peni called \"Wilfred Owen The Chances\" \n\nHis third book was titled \"Visions of Pope Adrian 37th\". It was published in 2011, again by Coptic Cat, in two extremely limited editions which both included a small piece of original art by Blinko, drawn directly onto a page of the book. The \"standard edition\" was limited to 370 copies, while the \"special edition\" was limited to 37. The book included 87 drawings, an introduction by outsider art specialist Colin Rhodes and a brief introduction by Blinko. The artwork in this book was reproduced in its original A5 size.\n\nBlinko also contributed to a collection of punk fiction short stories, \"Gobbing, Pogoing and Gratuitous Bad Language!: An Anthology of Punk Short Stories by Stewart Home (1996-04-06)\", published in 1996 by Spare Change Books. His story, \"Punk Alice\" (a reference to Rudimentary Peni's song \"Alice Crucifies the Paedophiles\"), is written in a sketchbook style of doodles and scribbled phrases referencing the death of punk, chess, Catholicism, depression, goth, Rudimentary Peni lyrics and drug chemicals.\n\nBlinko has contributed album artwork to several musical projects aside from his own. Among these are Part 1's 1985 release \"Pictures of Pain\", released on Pushead's label Pusmort; Coil's 1997 release, \"Unnatural History III\", released on Threshold House; Iron Lung's 2007 Prank Records release \"Sexless//No Sex\"; Omaniescum Aorisum's 2013 Solitude Records release \"Mademoiselle Hélène\"; and Fire in the Head's 2010 release \"Confessions of a Narcissist\". He also contributed musically to two releases by Fire in the Head.\n\nBlinko's artwork has been shown internationally and featured in books and magazines related to the field of outsider art. An exhibition at the National Schizophrenia Fellowship in 1994 first brought his art to public attention; he is now represented in the Collection de l'art brut in Lausanne. He had a show at Kinz + Tillou Gallery in New York City in 2006. Some of Blinko's artwork was featured at the Portland, Oregon art exhibit \"Entartete Kunts\" in June 2009. In 2011, he had a solo exhibit titled \"Visions of Pope Adrian 37th\" at Pallant House Gallery in the U.K.\n\nColin Rhodes' \"Outsider Art: Spontaneous Alternatives\", published by Thames & Hudson in 2000, featured Blinko's art and a description of his working process.\n\nBlinko currently resides on the \"outskirts of London\" in Abbots Langley.\n\nHe has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.\n\n"}

He currently represents , which includes most of the rural western portion of the state, as well as a few suburbs of Phoenix. He represented the neighboring 1st district during his first term and is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nGosar was born in Rock Springs, Wyoming, in 1958, son of Antone John Gosar and Bernadette M. (née Erramouspe) Gosar. His paternal grandparents were Slovenian and his maternal grandparents were Basque immigrants from Banca, France. Gosar is one of ten children.\n\nHe is the older brother of Pete Gosar, a former college football player at the University of Wyoming, who is a former chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party and was a candidate for governor of Wyoming, in 2010 and 2014.\n\nGosar received his B.A. from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, and later, his D.D.S. from the Boyne School of Dentistry at Creighton. He owned his own dentistry practice in Flagstaff for twenty-five years. He was the Arizona Dental Association's \"Dentist of the Year\" in 2001, and was inducted into the ADA Hall of Fame, also serving as its president. He was also president of the Northern Arizona Dental Society and vice-chair of the ADA council on governmental affairs.\n\n\nIn 2009, Gosar – who had never run for elected office before – announced he would challenge Democratic incumbent Ann Kirkpatrick in the 1st district in the 2010 elections. Gosar has been identified as a Tea Party candidate by \"The New York Times\" because the Arizona Tea Party featured Gosar on its website.\n\nGosar won the Republican primary. He was endorsed by Sarah Palin and three Arizona county sheriffs: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards, and Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu. Kirkpatrick challenged him to five debates across the district. Gosar initially agreed to one debate but later withdrew. Gosar released a statement explaining the decision to withdraw from the debate was based on the long drive to and from KAET in Phoenix, which organized the debate. A producer at KAET said Gosar's staff told the station the candidate could not participate in the debate because he would be attending a fundraiser instead.\n\nGosar defeated Kirkpatrick in the November 2010 general election, taking 49.7 percent of the vote.\n\n\nFollowing changes made in redistricting, Gosar was going to seek re-election in the 1st district, which was made less favorable to Republicans. However, with Kirkpatrick priming for a rematch, Gosar changed his mind and announced in January 2012 he would run in the newly created 4th district. The 4th had absorbed much of the western portion of the old 1st, and was heavily Republican. As part of the move, he bought a second home in Prescott, which he claimed as his official residence.\n\nGosar initially faced a tough primary fight against Babeu. However, Babeu pulled out in May 2012 due to allegations of abuse of power. Gosar defeated former state senator Ron Gould and businessman Rick Murphy in the Republican primary, all but assuring him of a second term. In the November general election, he defeated Democratic challenger Johnnie Robinson, with 67 percent of the vote.\n\n\nIn September 2018, six of Gosar's nine siblings released a political campaign ad against their brother and supporting his Democratic opponent, David Brill.\n\nGosar took to twitter to respond to the advert. He described his siblings as \"disgruntled Hillary supporters\" who \"put political ideology before family\".\n\nGosar defeated Brill in the November 2018 general election, taking 68.2% of the vote.\n\nPaul Gosar describes himself as pro-life. On abortions, Gosar states, \"These procedures undeniably rob the world of a human life in a most cruel fashion... The right thing to do is to ban these procedures.\" Gosar cosponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, a bill that would make permanent restrictions on federal funding of abortions in the US. Gosar also cosponsored the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, an act placing restrictions on abortions in the District of Columbia. Gosar was given a 100% rating by the National Right to Life Committee, a pro-life interest group, and a 0% rating by NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League), a pro-choice interest group.\n\nOn September 2015, Gosar submitted articles of impeachment against EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, asserting that she had committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors:\" and \"lied to the American people in order to force misguided and overreaching regulations, which have no scientific basis, down our throats.\" An EPA spokeswoman said Gosar's resolution \"has zero merit and is nothing more than political theater\" while fellow Republican and House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy confirmed that \"There's no plan to impeach Gina McCarthy.\"\n\nOn September 17, 2015, in an op-ed on the conservative website Townhall.com, Gosar announced that he would not attend Pope Francis' planned address to a joint meeting of Congress, unless the Pope spoke about issues such as \"violent Islam\" or Planned Parenthood, instead of climate change. Gosar wrote that he would treat the Pope the same way he believes \"leftist politicians\" should be treated. Gosar accused Francis of having \"adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into 'climate justice' and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies.\" Gosar condemned climate science as \"questionable\" and criticized \"Laudato si'\", Francis's encyclical on the environment.\n\nGosar did not attend Pope Francis's September 24 address, the only member of Congress not to do so.\n\nShortly after the Pope's visit, Gosar used his opposition to Francis's addresses as a fundraising tool. A fundraising email for Gosar used his Townhall.com op-ed's catchphrase, \"When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one\" and positioned Gosar as the victim of \"unprecedented attacks\" from \"the liberals, the left-wing media and the Obama political machine.\"\n\nGosar is against the legalization of marijuana and expressed concerns about public safety, children, and the commercial industry. He voted against the Veterans Equal Access Amendment, which allows veterans to access medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation. He has an \"F\" rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters.\n\nIn October 2017, Gosar promoted the theory that the Unite the Right rally, that occurred earlier that year was a left-wing plot to stoke racial discord and to undermine President Donald Trump. Gosar's statements echoed claims that were circulating among the right-of-center and promoted by Alex Jones of \"Infowars\". Gosar further believes the Charlottesville rally may have been funded by George Soros, who Gosar said \"turned in his own people to the Nazis\" despite being 13 years old in 1944. Seven of Gosar's own siblings wrote an open letter to the Kingman (Arizona) \"Daily Miner\" newspaper denouncing Gosar's claims about Soros as \"despicable slander...without a shred of truth\", saying the congressman \"owes George Soros a personal apology.\"\n\nIn 2015, Gosar scored 3% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters. On January 30, 2017 Gosar introduced House Joint resolution 46 which would repeal the authority of the National Park Service to decline private drilling for oil, gas and minerals in 40 U. S. National Parks if the Park Service determines that the mining operation would threaten the environment. \"The Washington Post\" said Gosar was \"no friend of environmentalists.\"\n\nIn 2010, Gosar signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.\n\nGosar voted in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nGosar has stated that the \"Second Amendment is one of the most important rights set forth by the Bill of Rights\" and has stated he will \"continue to oppose efforts to restrict, infringe, or remove this constitutionally protected right.\" Gosar was endorsed by the NRA (National Rifle Association) and given a rating of 92%. He was also endorsed by Gun Owners of America, and given a rating of 75%.\n\n\"The Arizona Republic\" describes Gosar as \"one of the staunchest opponents in Congress to legalizing undocumented dreamers\". Gosar stated, \"I strongly believe we need to immediately secure our border and oppose amnesty for anyone who blatantly violates our law.\" Gosar has cosponsored legislation to repeal the 14th Amendment, thus eliminating birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants. In an interview in May 2018, he accused immigration attorneys providing legal advice to undocumented immigrants of committing a crime: \"What we need to do is also hold those that are actually helping — what they're saying is help, but assisting in a crime — to be prosecuted as well.\" \n\nHe was given an \"A\" rating by NumbersUSA, an organization in support of immigration reduction.\n\nIn December 2014, Gosar drew controversy when he referred to American Indians as \"wards of the federal government\". He was responding to concerns from members of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in eastern Arizona when he made the comment that stunned people at the round-table talk in Flagstaff, Arizona. The topic had addressed the proposal to swap 2,400 acres of southeastern Arizona's Tonto National Forest for about 5,300 acres of environmentally sensitive land. The proposal, which was attached as a rider to the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, would give land sacred to the Apache in Arizona to Resolution Copper Mine, a joint venture owned by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Troy Eid, a Republican and former U.S. Attorney in Colorado, responded to Gosar's comments and said: \"In the heated context of what this represents, it's especially inappropriate to be resorting to what amounts to race baiting.\" A Gosar spokesperson said his comments were misconstrued.\n\nIn February 2018, Gosar posted on his Facebook page that the so-called Nunes memo shows \"clear and convincing evidence\" certain members of the FBI and Justice Department committed treason. In addition, Gosar specifically characterized conduct by James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates and Rod Rosenstein as \"not just criminal but constitutes treason.\" In what Gosar referred to as \"My full statement on the declassified memo\", Gosar reported he would be \"leading(sic) a letter to the Attorney General seeking criminal prosecution against these traitors to our nation.\"\nIn July 2018, Gosar spoke at a rally in London in support former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson. Gosar also used his speech to attack \"disgusting and depraved\" Muslim immigrants. Gosar and five other congressmen invited Robinson to speak to United States Congress on November 14, 2018, on a trip sponsored by the Islamophobic Middle East Forum. He was expected to get a visa despite his criminal convictions and use of fraudulent passports to enter and depart the U.S.\n\n\nAs of November 2017, Gosar is a member of dozens of House caucuses.

They were a nationalist family. Her brother James Ryan was a senior Fianna Fáil minister. Her sisters married Seán T. O'Kelly, Richard Mulcahy, and Denis McCullough. Ryan was educated in the small nearby national school at Caroreigh and in the Loreto Abbey in Gorey. For third level she went to University College, Dublin where she graduated with a B.Sc. in chemistry in 1916 followed by her master's degree the following year. She was the only woman in her year and only the fifth woman scientist to have graduated from the National University of Ireland since it began. During her time in college, the Easter rising took place. She reported for duty at the General Post Office, Dublin with her sisters, where they acted as messengers.The Ryan sisters also attempted to get the British army to stop firing on Red Cross locations. In the lead up to the events she and her sisters had acted as cover for the men meeting up. They would accompany them to make it look like men out with their girlfriends. Later between 1919 and 1921, during the war of independence she divided her time between her work and both political and military activities. Ryan was a member of, and at one point a captain in Cumman na mBan, though she did not join in the very beginning. She escaped arrest. She also worked with the organisations supporting those who did get arrested.\n\nWhen the Irish Civil War began Ryan agreed with the anti-treaty side and wrote to her sister Min severing ties with herself and Richard Mulcahy for the duration.\n\nRyan worked with Professor Hugh Ryan and published papers. Some of their research was funded by Nobels Ltd. Ryan went to London to train as a public analyst. When she came back to Dublin she worked in the college laboratory. Then in 1925 she started a private practice as a public analyst. She chose to hire women graduate chemists. Eventually Ryan was the public analyst for twelve county councils. For many years she was the only woman public analyst in Ireland.\nRyan was a founder member of the Irish Chemical Association (1922–36). She was on the committee of the Irish Chemical Association (1936–7), and then vice-president (1938–40) and president (1940–41). In 1934 Ryan became a member of the first industrial research council.\n\nIn September 1936, Ryan married Séan T. O'Kelly. He was the widower of her sister Mary Kate. The couple needed, and received, a papal dispensation. They had no children. She was known as Mrs Phyllis O'Kelly or Phyllis Bean Úi Cheallaigh from then on. Her husband became President of Ireland in 1945 at which point Ryan gave up business and turned to trees and plants. Her hobbies included flower arranging and bridge.\nHer husband retired as President in 1959 at which point they moved to Roundwood, Co. Wicklow. He died in 1966, and she died 19 November 1983 in the hospice at Harold's Cross, Dublin and is buried at Glasnevin Cemetery.\n"}

His father Lorenzo Martínez de la Sagra came from a noble merchant family, which became wealthy through trade with the Spanish colonies in America. His mother was Antonia Rodríguez Perís, who met his father in Saint Augustine. His brother migrated to Uruguay to start a business there, when Sagra was three years old.\n\nRamón de la Sagra studied physics for one year in Nautical School of A Coruña. Afterwards he attended the military college of Santiago de Compostela until reaching adulthood. Afterwards he joined the local university, where he studied anatomy, medicine, mathematics and pharmaceuticals. There he started spreading liberal ideas. For these actions the Inquisition started threatening him, until he was transferred at the University of Madrid. There he contributed to the newspaper \"El Conservador\". In 1821 he migrated to Cuba as an assistant of Agustìn Rodriguez. One year later he was appointed to the position of Professor of Natural History of Cuba. \nIn 1822 he married Manuela Turnes del Rìo. For the next ten years he would travel in the Americas, until settling in Paris in 1835. He traveled to the United States from April 20th to September 23rd of 1835 and the following year published \"Five Monthes in the United States of North America\" in Paris based on his experiences there. He also accumulated several volumes of pamphlets and economic and scientific reports while traveling in the United States. \n\nIn Paris he became a disciple of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. He returned to Spain in 1837 and was elected a member of the parliament four times (1838, 1840, 1845, 1854) as a representative of the Liberal Party. At the same time he began publishing a thirteen volume history on the political and natural history of Cuba which he would complete in 1857. In 1939 he published \"Voyage en Hollande et en Belgique sous le rapport de l’instruction primaire, des établissements de bien faisance et des prisons, dans les deux pays\" (published in Paris, 1939 in French and in Spanish in 1844). In 1845 he founded the world's first anarchist journal \"El Porvenir\", which was closed by Ramón María Narváez, Duke of Galicia. After the French Revolution of 1848, he created with Proudhon the Peoples' Bank of France. In Brussels he met Heinrich Ahrens, disciple of Krause, whose doctrines he proclaimed in Spain before Julian Sanz del Rio. He continued to publish economic, geographic, political, social, and prison reform studies. In 1849 he was expelled from France, because he was spreading Socialist ideas. In 1856 he was expelled from Spain to France by Ramón María Narváez, because he was spreading radical ideas. In Paris he met Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. There he worked as the consul of Uruguay. He returned to Cuba between 1859 and 1860 and published numerous studies and essays there. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he went to Switzerland, where he died on 23 May 1871 at the age of seventy-three.\n\nRamón de la Sagra is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Cuban lizard, \"Diploglossus delasagra\".\n\n"}

He became a communist around 1910 while studying at Saint Petersburg State University. He then moved to Troitskosavsk where he wrote for a local newspaper and traveled throughout Mongolia, becoming involved in clandestine Mongolian revolutionary activities. Elbegdorj befriended a young Khorloogiin Choibalsan in Irkutsk between 1914 and 1918 and became a strong early influence on future Mongolian leader.\n\nBy 1920, Elbegdorj's connection to Mongolian revolutionary groups and his expertise on Mongolian affairs made him an indispensable part of Soviet efforts to steer Mongolia's early revolutionary development. In 1920 he organized the first meetings between Mongolian revolutionaries and members of the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Fifth Red Army and acted as the group's Russian interpreter. He also accompanied delegates Soliin Danzan and Dambyn Chagdarjav to Moscow where they met Russian communist leader Nikolay Bukharin. He was also a guiding presence at the first secret meeting of the Mongolian People's Party held in Troitskosavsk from March 1–3, 1921 (later known as the First Party Congress of the MPRP) where the provisional revolutionary government of Mongolia was established.\n\nFollowing the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921 Elbegdorj was appointed head of the Mongolian army training and education department. Along with Choibalsan, he established the radicalized Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL), through which he exerted a strong influence on the political orientation of Mongolian revolutionary policy in its early years. By this time he was recognized as one of the leading figures of Mongolia's revolutionary government and with the backing he enjoyed from Moscow, he came to dominate the political scene in Ulan Bator, often emerging as victor from party infighting. In 1922 he successfully collaborated with Soliin Danzan and Damdin Sükhbaatar to eliminate Prime Minister Dogsomyn Bodoo in a power struggle.\n\nAfter the purge of Bodoo, a rivalry developed between Elbegdorj and Danzan that came to a head at the Third Party Congress in 1924. Danzan had angered Elbegdorj and the Comintern when he sought to reduce the number of Soviet advisers in Mongolia, attempted to bring the radicalized Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL) under party control, and resisted Soviet advice that Mongolia bypass capitalism and move directly to socialism. Recognized as leader of the party's leftist faction, Elbegdorj joined with rightists under Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj to orchestrate Danzan's the arrest and execution. At the Third Party Congress Danzan was Officially accused of representing bourgeois interests and engaging in business with Chinese firms. Within a day Danzan and several colleagues were arrested and executed, sending a shock wave through the party that solidified Soviet dominance of Mongolian politics.\n\nIn the wake of the Third Party Congress, Rightists under Dambadorj assumed control and, during a period later referred to as the “Right Opportunism” (1925-1928), promoted rightist policies mirroring Lenin’s New Economic Policy in the Soviet Union. Elbegdorj helped draft the country's 1924 Constitution (based largely on the Soviet constitution), but soon thereafter saw his influence wane with the appointment of Turar Ryskulov as the new chief Comintern adviser in Ulaanbaatar in 1924.\n\nBy 1925 Elbegdorj was accused of being a \"bourgeois\" nationalist whose pan-Mongolian sentiments, expressed at the Third Party Congress in 1924, were seen as contrary to communist policy. The power struggle between Ryskulov and Elbegdorj eventually resulted in both being recalled to Moscow in 1928. He then taught at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East training many of the young MPRP members who attended the school. Elbegdorj was arrested in 1937 during the Great Purge, sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court on June 4, 1938 and executed on June 10, 1938.\n\nHe was rehabilitated in 1957.\n\n"}

{"id": "217513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217513", "title": "Suharto", "text": "Suharto\n\nSuharto (, ; 8 June 1921 – 27 January 2008) was an Indonesian military leader and politician who served as the second President of Indonesia, holding the office for 31 years, from the ousting of Sukarno in 1967 until his resignation in 1998.\n\nSuharto was born in a small village, Kemusuk, in the Godean area near the city of Yogyakarta, during the Dutch colonial era. He grew up in humble circumstances. His Javanese Muslim parents divorced not long after his birth, and he lived with foster parents for much of his childhood. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Suharto served in Japanese-organised Indonesian security forces. Indonesia's independence struggle saw his joining the newly formed Indonesian army. Suharto rose to the rank of major general following Indonesian independence. An attempted coup on 30 September 1965 allegedly backed by the Communist Party of Indonesia was countered by Suharto-led troops. The army subsequently led an anti-communist purge, which the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency described as \"one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century\" and Suharto wrested power from Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno. He was appointed acting president in 1967, and elected President the following year. He then mounted a social campaign known as de-Soekarnoization to reduce the former President's influence. Support for Suharto's presidency was strong throughout the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, the New Order's authoritarianism and widespread corruption were a source of discontent and, following a severe financial crisis, led to widespread unrest and his resignation in May 1998. Suharto died in 2008 and was given a state funeral.\n\nThe legacy of Suharto's 31-year rule is debated both in Indonesia and abroad. Under his \"New Order\" administration, Suharto constructed a strong, centralised and military-dominated government. An ability to maintain stability over a sprawling and diverse Indonesia and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic support of the West during the Cold War. For most of his presidency, Indonesia experienced significant economic growth and industrialisation,\ndramatically improving health, education and living standards.\n\nPlans to award National Hero status to Suharto are being considered by the Indonesian government and have been debated vigorously in Indonesia. According to Transparency International, Suharto is the most corrupt leader in modern history, having embezzled an alleged $15–35 billion during his rule.\n\nSuharto was born on 8 June 1921 during the Dutch East Indies era, in a plaited-bamboo-walled house in the hamlet of Kemusuk, a part of the larger village of Godean. The village is west of Yogyakarta, the cultural heartland of the Javanese. Born to ethnic Javanese parents, he was the only child of his father's second marriage. His father, Kertosudiro, had two children from his previous marriage, and was a village irrigation official. His mother, Sukirah, a local woman, was distantly related to Hamengkubuwana V by his first concubine.\n\nFive weeks after Suharto's birth, his mother suffered a nervous breakdown and he was placed in the care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo. Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies. In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near Wonogiri. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.\n\nPrawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquinted with Darjatmo, a \"dukun\" (\"shaman\") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language. Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee Muhammadiyah middle school in the city of Yogyakarta until 1939.\n\nLike many Javanese, Suharto had only one name. In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called \"Haji\" or \"el-Haj Mohammed Suharto\" but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \"Suharto\" reflects modern Indonesian spelling, although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was \"Soeharto\" but he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'.\n\nSuharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he is believed to have had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.\n\nSuharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes. Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in June 1940, and undertook basic training in Gombong near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese. Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL \"Kaderschool\" in Gombong to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in Cisarua.\n\nFollowing the Dutch surrender to the invading Japanese forces in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force. In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the PETA (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of \"shodancho\" (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese \"bushido\", or \"way of the warrior\", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.\n\nSuharto was posted to a PETA coastal defence battalion at Wates, south of Yogyakarta, until he was admitted for training for company commander (\"chudancho\") in Bogor from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in Surakarta, Jakarta, and Madiun. The Japanese surrender and Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of Mount Wilis) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed February 1945 PETA Revolt in Blitar, led by Supriyadi.\n\nTwo days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence, and were appointed President and Vice-President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment in accordance with orders from the Japanese command, and returned to Yogyakarta. As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army. On the basis of his PETA experience, he was appointed deputy commander, and subsequently a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organised in October 1945. Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around Magelang and Semarang, and was subsequently appointed head of a brigade as lieutenant-colonel, having earned respect as a field commander. In the early years of the War, he organised local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to Major and became Battalion X's leader.\n\nThe arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the \"status quo ante bellum\", quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T (\"Tiger\") Brigade on 17 May 1946. It earned him the respect of Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces. The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the \"Diponegoro Division\") stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946, the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for defence of the west and southwest of Yogyakarta from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of opium through the territory he controlled, to generate income. In September 1948, Suharto was dispatched to meet Musso, chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the communist uprising in Madiun.\n\nIn December 1948, the Dutch launched \"Operation Crow\", which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital Yogyakarta. Suharto was appointed to lead the \"Wehrkreise III\", consisting of two battalions, which waged guerilla warfare against the Dutch from the hills south of Yogyakarta. In dawn raids on 1 March 1949, Suharto's forces and local militia recaptured the city, holding it until noon. Suharto's later accounts had him as the lone plotter, although other sources say Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta, and the Panglima of the Third Division, ordered the attack. However, General Abdul Nasution said that Suharto took great care in preparing the \"General Offensive\" (Indonesian \"Serangan Umum\"). Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations, which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949. Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Suharto married Siti Hartinah (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996. The couple had six children: Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati (\"Titiek Suharto\", born 1959), Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). Within the Javanese upper class, it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce to supplement the family budget, allowing her husband to keep his dignity in his official role. The commercial dealings of Tien, her children and grandchildren became extensive and ultimately undermined Suharto's presidency.\n\nIn the years following Indonesian independence, Suharto served in the Indonesian National Army, primarily in Java. In 1950, as a colonel, he led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing the Makassar Uprising, a rebellion of former colonial soldiers who supported the Dutch-established State of East Indonesia and its federal entity, the United States of Indonesia. During his year in Makassar, Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours, the Habibie family, whose eldest son BJ Habibie was later Suharto's vice-president, and went on to succeed him as President. In 1951–1952, Suharto led his troops in defeating the Islamic-inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in the Klaten area of Central Java. Appointed to lead four battalions in early 1953, he organised their participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in the Mount Merapi area. He also sought to stem leftist sympathies amongst his troops. His experience in this period left Suharto with a deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism.\nBetween 1956 and 1959, he served in the important position of commander of Diponegoro Division based in Semarang, responsible for Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces. His relationship with prominent businessmen Liem Sioe Liong and Bob Hasan, which extended throughout his presidency, began in Central Java, where he was involved in a series of \"profit generating\" enterprises conducted primarily to keep the poorly funded military unit functioning. Army anti-corruption investigations implicated Suharto in a 1959 smuggling scandal. Relieved of his position, he was transferred to the army's Staff and Command School (\"Seskoad\") in the city of Bandung. While in Bandung, he was promoted to brigadier-general, and in late 1960, promoted to army deputy chief of staff. On 6 March 1961, he was given an additional command, as head of the army's new Strategic Reserve (\"Korps Tentara I Cadangan Umum AD\", later KOSTRAD), a ready-reaction air-mobile force based in Jakarta.\n\nIn January 1962, Suharto was promoted to the rank of major general and appointed to lead Operation Mandala, a joint army-navy-air force command based in Makassar. This formed the military side of the campaign to win western New Guinea from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia. In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's \"Konfrontasi\", against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that \"Konfrontasi\" would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, Ali Murtopo, to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.\n\nTensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI’s proposal for a \"fifth armed force\" consisting of armed peasants and workers. However, this idea was rejected by the army’s leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces. In May, the \"Gilchrist Document\" aroused Sukarno's fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he mentioned repeatedly during the next few months. On his independence day speech in August, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes, and warned the Army not to interfere.\n\nWhile Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger, while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled. Sukarno's Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno's protection. They feared imminent establishment of communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had 3 million members, and were particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. PKI has become the strongest political party in Indonesia.\n\nBefore dawn on 1 October 1965, six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard, Diponegoro Division, and Brawidjaja Division. Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre. At 7:10 am Untung bin Sjamsuri announced on radio that the \"30 September Movement\" had forestalled a coup attempt on Sukarno by \"CIA-backed power-mad generals\", and that it was \"an internal army affair\". The 30 September Movement never made any attempt on Suharto's life. Suharto had been in Jakarta army hospital that evening with his three-year-old son Tommy who had a scalding injury. It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief, a key member of 30 September Movement and close family friend of Suharto. According to Latief's later testimony, the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno-loyalist, hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals, upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality.\n\nUpon being told of the killings, Suharto went to KOSTRAD headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilized KOSTRAD and RPKAD (now Kopassus) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00 pm that six generals had been kidnapped by \"counter-revolutionaries\" and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He said he was in control of the army, and that he would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno. Suharto issued an ultimatum to Halim Air Force Base, where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander Omar Dhani and PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the air base on 2 October after short fighting. With the failure of the poorly organised coup, and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October). On 5 October, Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals' bodies.\n\nComplicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup's organisers and their aims. The army's version, and subsequently that of the \"New Order\", was that the PKI was solely responsible. A propaganda campaign by the army, and Islamic and Catholic student groups, convinced both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a communist coup attempt, and that the killings were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes. The army in alliance with religious civilian groups led a campaign to purge Indonesian society, government, and armed forces of the communist party and leftist organisations. The purge spread from Jakarta to much of the rest of the country. (see: Indonesian killings of 1965–1966). The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed. As many as 1.5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another. As a result of the purge, one of Sukarno's three pillars of support, the Indonesian Communist Party, was effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam.\n\nSukarno continued to command loyalty from large sections of the armed forces as well as the general population, and Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.\n\nIn January 1966, university students under the banner of KAMI, begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection from the army. Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.\n\nIn February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full general in July 1966). The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace (60 km away) by helicopter. Three Suhartoist generals, Major-General Basuki Rahmat, Brigadier-General M Jusuf, and Brigadier-General Amirmachmud went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see \"Supersemar\") that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.\n\nUsing the \"Supersemar\" letter, Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day, and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint a new cabinet consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the MPRS (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each services.\n\nIn June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of Marxism–Leninism, ratifying the Supersemar, and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year). Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among certain elements of the armed forces.\n\nBy January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto for the first of his five-year terms as President.\n\nSuharto promoted his \"New Order\", as opposed to Sukarno's \"Old Order\", as a society based on the Pancasila ideology. After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as basic principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".\n\nThe New Order also implemented the \"Dwifungsi\" (\"Dual Function\") policy enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere \"primus inter pares\", and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-Communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (\"Aspri\") clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly Ali Murtopo, began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General Nasution's 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals Hartono Rekso Dharsono, Kemal Idris, and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological two-party system similar to those found in many Western countries. Suharto sent Dharsono overseas as an ambassador, while Idris and Wibowo were sent to distant North Sumatera and South Sulawesi as regional commanders.\n\nSuharto's previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (\"Angkatan '66\") were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections (\"Golput\" movement), the costly construction of the Taman Mini Indonesia Indah theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists (Malari Incident of 1974), and the lack of term limits of Suharto's presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, Adnan Buyung Nasution, Hariman Siregar, and Sjahrir), and even sending troops to occupy the campus of ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology) from January–March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing decree on \"Normalization of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.\n\nOn 15–16 January 1974, Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in Jakarta during a visit by Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors were encouraged by General Sumitro, deputy commander of the armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. Suharto learned that the riots were engineered by Sumitro to destabilize the regime, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred as the Malari Incident (\"Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari\" / Disaster of 15 January). However, Suharto also disbandedAspri to appease popular dissent.\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent political figures signed the Petition of Fifty which criticised Suharto's use of Pancasila to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.\n\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a parliament (\"Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat\"/MPR) with the power to elect presidents, consisting of a lower house (\"Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat\"/DPR) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realized the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party the PNI, in 1969 Suharto decided to take-over control of an obscure military-run federation of NGOs called Golkar (\"Functional Group\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right-hand man Ali Murtopo. The first general election was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants; consisting of Golkar, four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics, Golkar managed to secure 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly appointed Suharto to second-term in office with Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX as vice-president.\n\nOn 5 January 1973, to allow better control, the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into PPP (\"Partai Persatuan Pembangunan\"/United Development Party) while the five non-Islamic parties were fused into PDI (\"Partai Demokrasi Indonesia\"/Indonesian Democratic Party). The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership, while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"Pancasila Democracy\", Suharto was re-elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998. Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election, ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition. For all intents and purposes, he held all governing power in the nation.\n\nSuharto proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to corporatism. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created the Indonesian National Civil Service Corps (\"Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia\" or \"Korpri\") in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organized the FBSI (\"Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia\") as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the MUI in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimilation of the influential Chinese-Indonesians, the Suharto government passed several laws as part of so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were encouraged to take-up Indonesian-sounding names. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful family-planning program (\"Keluarga Berentjana / KB\") to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.\nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organized by the Kopkamtib (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the \"Dwifungsi\" (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorized \"Operasi Trisula\" which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organize a guerilla base in Blitar area in 1968, and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in West Kalimantan (1967–1972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of Free Aceh Movement separatists under Hasan di Tiro in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad. Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight by Islamic extremists at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok.\n\nTo comply with New York Agreement of 1962 which required a plebiscite on integration of West Irian into Indonesia before end of 1969, the Suharto government begin organizing for a so-called \"Act of Free Choice\" scheduled for July–August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under Sarwo Edhie Wibowo which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch-organized militia (\"Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps / PVK\") at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963, while sending Catholic volunteers under Jusuf Wanandi to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite will be channeled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by United Nations General Assembly in November 1969.\n\nTo stabilize the economy and to ensure long-term support for the New Order, Suharto’s administration enlisted a group of mostly American-educated Indonesian economists, dubbed the \"Berkeley Mafia\", to formulate significant changes in economic policy. By cutting subsidies, decreasing government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation was lowered from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of famine was alleviated by influx of USAID rice aid shipments in 1967 to 1968.\n\nWith a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as Astra Group and Salim Group.\n\nFrom 1967, the government secured low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit. With the IGGI funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the 1973 oil crisis, the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans, dubbed REPELITA (\"Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun\") I to VI from 1969 to 1998.\n\nOutside the formal economy, Suharto created a network of charitable organizations (\"yayasan\") run by the military and his family members, which extracted \"donations\" from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits. While some proceeds were used for charitable purposes, much of the money was re-cycled as slush fund to reward political allies and to maintain support for the New Order.\nIn 1975, the state-owned oil company, Pertamina, defaulted on its foreign loans as a result of mismanagement and corruption under the leadership of Suharto’s close ally, Ibnu Sutowo. The government bail-out of the company nearly doubled the national debt.\n\nUpon assuming power, Suharto government adopted policy of neutrality in the Cold War, but was nevertheless quietly aligned with the Western bloc (including Japan and South Korea) with the objective of securing support for Indonesia's economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. Diplomatic relations with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in 30 September Movement (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, Soviet Union embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister Adam Malik managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with Malaysia in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organization is designed to establish peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as ongoing Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of Portuguese Timor descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the Carnation Revolution, whereby the left wing populist Fretilin (\"Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente\") emerged triumphant. With approval from Western countries (including from US president Gerald Ford and Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene claiming to prevent establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups UDT and APODETI, Suharto authorized full-scale invasion of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of East Timor in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977–1979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing guerilla resistance caused the government to maintain strong military force in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during Indonesian rule (1974–1999); namely, 17,600–19,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness, although Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70% of the violent killings. Indonesia's invasion and occupation of East Timor during Suharto's presidency resulted in at least 100,000 deaths. \n\nReal socio-economic progress sustained support for Suharto's regime across three decades. By 1996, Indonesia's poverty rate has dropped to around 11% compared with 45% in 1970. From 1966 to 1997, Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5.03% pa, pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US$806 to US$4,114. In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP, and 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested in massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of series of Palapa telecommunication satellites); consequently Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalize on such achievements to justify his regime, and an MPR resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the \"Puskesmas\" program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60%. The government's \"Inpres\" program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrollment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from the FAO in November 1985.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the 1980s oil glut by successfully shifting the basis of the economy to export-oriented labor-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency devaluations. Industrialization was mostly undertaken by Chinese-Indonesian companies which evolved into immense conglomerates dominating the nation's economy. The largest of these conglomerates were the Salim Group led by Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim), Sinar Mas Group led by Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja), Astra Group led by Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya), Lippo Group led by Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady), Barito Pacific Group led by Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu), and Nusamba Group led by Bob Hasan. Suharto decided to support the growth of a small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they would not pose a political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (\"PAKTO 88\") which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the \"TABANAS\" program to the populace. The Jakarta Stock Exchange, re-opened in 1977, recorded a \"bull run\", due to a spree of domestic IPOs and an influx of foreign funds after deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fueled strong economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997 which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.\n\nThe growth of the economy coincided with rapid expansion of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (\"Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN\"). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (\"Tutut\"), Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\"), and Bambang Trihatmodjo, had grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the toll-expressway market which was monopolized by Tutut, the national car project monopolized by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market, monopolized by 21 Cineplex (owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000 km² of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000 m² of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of \"yayasan\"s run by the Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.\n\nIn early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believed to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades; in order of amount allegedly stolen USD, the highest ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $15 billion – $35 billion.\n\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, and use of the military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate (see \"Petrus Killings\"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The Tanjung Priok massacre saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of Borobudur, led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and Abu Bakar Bashir (later leader of Jemaah Islamiyah). Attacks on police by a resurgent Free Aceh Movement in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating license (\"SIUPP\") which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.\n\nWestern concern over communism waned with end of Cold War, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny, particularly following the 1991 Santa Cruz Massacre in East Timor. Suharto was elected as head of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1992, while Indonesia became a founding member of APEC in 1989 and host to the Bogor APEC Summit in 1994.\n\nDomestically, the business dealings of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. The March 1988 MPR session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of Sudharmono, a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. Moerdani’s criticism of the Suharto family's corruption saw the President dismiss him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarize\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful Kopkamtib in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto begin courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicised hajj pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protégé BJ Habibie, the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 riot in Medan.\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as Habibie, Harmoko, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, and Akbar Tanjung, who owed their position solely to Suharto. As sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded East German Navy in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.\n\nIn the 1990s, elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto's economic development, were becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children, fueling demands for \"Reformasi\" (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. By 1996, Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno and chairwoman of the normally compliant PDI, was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General Sutiyoso on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped, and some killed, by army squads led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General Prabowo Subianto.\n\nIndonesia was the country hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.\n\nIn December 1997, Suharto for the first time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.\n\nThe economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in Situbondo (1996), Tasikmalaya (1996), Banjarmasin (1997), and Makassar (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and Madurese settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997. Golkar won the rigged 1997 MPR elections and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He appointed his protégé BJ Habibie as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter Tutut became Minister of Social Affairs). The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability, rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices. The Government increased the fuel prices further by 70% on May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in Medan.\n\nWith Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician Amien Rais, spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations. The crisis climaxed while Suharto was on a state visit to Egypt on 12 May 1998, when security forces killed four demonstrators from Jakarta's Trisakti University. Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General Wiranto and Prabowo, and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution. Recently-released documents from the United States Department of State indicate that the Clinton Administration sought to maintain close ties with the Indonesian military in the aftermath of Suharto's fall from power. \n\nAfter resigning from the presidency, Suharto reclused himself in his family compound in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto's family spend much of their time fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.\n\nIn May 1999, \"Time Asia\" estimated Suharto's family fortune at US$15 billion in cash, shares, corporate assets, real estate, jewellery and fine art. Suharto sued the magazine seeking more than $US 27 billion in damages for libel over the article. On 10 September 2007, Indonesia's Supreme Court awarded Suharto damages against \"Time Asia\" magazine, ordering it to pay him one trillion rupiah ($128.59 million). The High Court reversed the judgement of an appellate court and Central Jakarta district court (made in 2000 and 2001).\n\nSuharto was placed highest on Transparency International's list of corrupt leaders with an alleged misappropriation of between US $15–35 billion during his 32-year presidency.\n\nOn 29 May 2000, Suharto was placed under house arrest when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to one of a number of foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110 m (£55 m).\n\nIn 2002, Suharto's son Tommy, was sentenced to 15 years' jail for ordering the killing of a judge (who had previously convicted him of corruption), illegal weapons possession and fleeing justice. In 2006, he was freed on \"conditional release\".\n\nIn 2003, Suharto's half-brother Probosutedjo was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the \"judicial mafia\" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on 30 November 2005.\n\nOn 9 July 2007, Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against former President Suharto, to recover state funds ($440 m or £219 m, which allegedly disappeared from a scholarship fund, and a further $1.1 billion in damages).\n\nAfter resigning from the presidency, Suharto was hospitalised repeatedly for stroke, heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute him as his lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial. Moreover, there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him. In 2006, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial. One physician, Brigadier-General Dr Marjo Subiandono, stated his doubts about by noting that \"[Suharto] has two permanent cerebral defects.\" In a later \"Financial Times\" report, Attorney General Abdurrahman discussed the re-examination, and called it part of a \"last opportunity\" to prosecute Suharto criminally. Attorney General Abdurrahman left open the possibility of filing suit against the Suharto estate.\n\nOn 4 January 2008, Suharto was taken to the Pertamina hospital, Jakarta with complications arising from a weak heart, swelling of limbs and stomach, and partial renal failure. His health fluctuated for several weeks but progressively worsened with anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart and kidney complications, internal bleeding, fluid on his lungs, and blood in his faeces and urine which caused a haemoglobin drop. On 23 January, Suharto's health worsened further, as a sepsis infection spread through his body. His family consented to the removal of life support machines, and he died on 27 January at 1:10 pm\n\nMinutes after his death, then former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a news conference declaring Suharto as one of Indonesia's \"best sons\" and invited the country to give the highest respect and honor to the ex-president.\n\nSuharto's body was taken from Jakarta to the Giri Bangun mausoleum complex near the Central Java city of Solo. He was buried alongside his late wife in a state military funeral with full honours, with the Kopassus elite forces and KOSTRAD commandos as the honour guard and pallbearers and Commander of Group II Kopassus Surakarta Lt. Colonel Asep Subarkah. In attendance were the incumbent president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as \"Ceremony Inspector\", and vice-president, government ministers, and armed forces chiefs of staff. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to see the convoy. Condolences were offered by many regional heads of state, and Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono declared a week of official mourning. During this tenure, all flags of Indonesia were flown at half-mast.\n\n\n\n\n|-\n"}

Channing's father, Francis Dana Channing, died when he was an infant, and responsibility for the young man's education was assumed by his uncle, William Ellery Channing, the pre-eminent Unitarian theologian of the early nineteenth century. The younger William graduated from Harvard College in 1829 and from Harvard Divinity School in 1833. He was ordained and installed over the Unitarian church in Cincinnati in 1835. He became warmly interested in the schemes of Charles Fourier and others for social reorganization. He moved to Boston about 1847, afterward to Rochester, New York and to New York City, where, both as preacher and editor, he became a leader in a movement of Christian socialism. As an early supporter of the socialistic movement in the United States, he was editor of the \"Present\", the \"Spirit of the Age\" and the \"Harbinger\". In 1848 he presided over The Religious Union of Associationists in Boston, a socialist group which included many members of the Brook Farm commune.\n\nChanning took active part in the early years of the woman’s rights movement. He signed the call for and attended the first National Woman's Rights Convention in 1850, where he was appointed to the National Women’s Rights Central Committee. As minister of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester in 1852, he influenced Susan B. Anthony, a member of his congregation who was a young schoolteacher on the threshold of her career as a women's rights activist. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony's close friend and co-worker, said in her autobiography that, \"She [Anthony] first found words to express her convictions in listening to Rev. William Henry Channing, whose teaching had a lasting spiritual influence upon her.\" Channing wrote the call for and played a leading role in the Women's Rights Convention that Anthony organized in Rochester in 1853. The convention launched a petition campaign for equal legal and voting rights for women, for which Channing wrote the petitions and, with Ernestine Rose, addressed a select committee of the New York Senate in February 1854.\n\nBetween 1854-1857, Channing was minister at Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel in Liverpool, England. In 1857, he succeeded James Martineau as minister of the Hope Street Unitarian Chapel, Liverpool, England. At the commencement of the American Civil War, he returned (1862) and took charge of the Unitarian church in Washington, D. C. William Henry Channing, along with the younger Ellery Channing, was a Transcendentalist. He was a prolific writer, contributing to the \"North American Review\", the \"Dial\", the \"Christian Examiner\", and other serials, a member of the Transcendental Club, a close friend of Henry David Thoreau and corresponded with Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nAmong his inspirational writings, one piece, his \"Symphony\", is well-known:\n\nChanning was, in 1863 and 1864, the Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives. He died in London.\n\n\n\n\n"}
