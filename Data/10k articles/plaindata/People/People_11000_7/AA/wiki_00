The name was changed in 1920 to the \"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\" – NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the Nazi Party). This political party was formed and developed during the post-World War I era. It was anti-Marxist and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the Weimar Republic and the Treaty of Versailles; and it advocated extreme nationalism and Pan-Germanism as well as virulent anti-Semitism. Hitler's \"rise\" can be considered to have ended in March 1933, after the Reichstag adopted the Enabling Act of 1933 in that month. President Paul von Hindenburg had already appointed Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Act—when used ruthlessly and with authority—virtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection.\n\nAdolf Hitler rose to a place of prominence in the early years of the party. Being one of the best speakers of the party, he told the other members to either make him leader of the party or he would never return. He was aided in part by his willingness to use violence in advancing his political objectives and to recruit party members who were willing to do the same. The Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923 and the later release of his book \"Mein Kampf\" (Translation: \"My Struggle\") introduced Hitler to a wider audience. In the mid-1920s, the party engaged in electoral battles in which Hitler participated as a speaker and organizer, as well as in street battles and violence between the \"Rotfrontkämpferbund\" and the Nazis' \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA). Through the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazis gathered enough electoral support to become the largest political party in the Reichstag, and Hitler's blend of political acuity, deceptiveness and cunning converted the party's non-majority but plurality status into effective governing power in the ailing Weimar Republic of 1933.\n\nOnce in power, the Nazis created a mythology surrounding the rise to power, and they described the period that roughly corresponds to the scope of this article as either the \"Kampfzeit\" (the time of struggle) or the \"Kampfjahre\" (years of struggle).\n\nAdolf Hitler became involved with the fledgling Nazi Party after the First World War, and set the violent tone of the movement early, by forming the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) paramilitary. Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to power – but an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich Beerhall Putsch. He used the time to produce \"Mein Kampf\", in which he argued that the effeminate Jewish-Christian ethic was enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire. He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through \"legal\" means.\n\nAfter being granted permission from King Ludwig III of Bavaria, 25-year-old Austrian-born Hitler enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German army, although he was not yet a German citizen. For over four years (August 1914 – November 1918), Germany was a principal actor in World War I, on the Western Front. Soon after the fighting on the front ended in November 1918, Hitler returned to Munich after the Armistice with no job, no real civilian job skills and no friends. He remained in the \"Reichswehr\" and was given a relatively meaningless assignment during the winter of 1918–1919, but was eventually recruited by the Army's Political Department (Press and News Bureau), possibly because of his assistance to the army in investigating the responsibility for the ill-fated Bavarian Soviet Republic. He took part in \"national thinking\" courses under Captain Karl Mayr. Apparently his skills in oratory, as well as his extreme and open anti-Semitism, caught the eye of an approving army officer and he was promoted to an \"education officer\"—which gave him an opportunity to speak in public.\n\nIn July 1919 Hitler was appointed \"Verbindungsmann\" (intelligence agent) of an \"Aufklärungskommando\" (reconnaissance commando) of the \"Reichswehr\", both to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). The DAP had been formed by Anton Drexler, Karl Harrer and others, through amalgamation of other groups, on 5 January 1919 at a small gathering in Munich at the restaurant Fuerstenfelder Hof. While he studied the activities of the DAP, Hitler became impressed with Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist ideas.\n\nDuring the 12 September 1919 meeting, Hitler took umbrage with comments made by an audience member that were directed against Gottfried Feder, the speaker, a crank economist with whom Hitler was acquainted due to a lecture Feder delivered in an army \"education\" course. The audience member (Hitler in \"Mein Kampf\" disparagingly called him the \"professor\") asserted that Bavaria should be wholly independent from Germany and should secede from Germany and unite with Austria to form a new South German nation. The volatile Hitler arose and scolded the unfortunate Professor Baumann, using his speaking skills and eventually causing Baumann to leave the meeting before its adjournment. Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party. Within a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a \"committee\" meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the \"committee\" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house. Later Hitler wrote that joining the fledgling party \"...was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there was and could be no turning back. ... I registered as a member of the German Workers' Party and received a provisional membership card with the number 7\". Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. However, in this case, Hitler had Captain Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks.\n\nBy early 1920 the DAP had grown to over 101 members, and Hitler received his membership card as member number 555.\n\nHitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920 and his actions began to transform the party. He organised their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, on 24 February 1920 in the \"Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München\". There Hitler announced the party's 25-point program (\"see\" National Socialist Program). He engineered the name change of the DAP to the \"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\" – NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party), commonly known to the rest of the world as the Nazi Party. Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler was later discharged from the army in March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP.\nIn 1920, a small \"hall protection\" squad was organised around Emil Maurice. The group was first named the \"Order troops\" (\"Ordnertruppen\"). Later in August 1921, Hitler redefined the group, which became known as the \"Gymnastic and Sports Division\" of the party (\"Turn- und Sportabteilung\"). By the autumn of 1921 the group was being called the \"Sturmabteilung\" (Storm Detachment) or SA, and in November 1921 the group was officially known by that name. \n\nThroughout 1920, Hitler began to lecture at Munich's beer halls, particularly the Hofbräuhaus, Sterneckerbräu and Bürgerbräukeller. Only Hitler was able to bring in the crowds for the party speeches and meetings. By this time, the police were already monitoring the speeches, and their own surviving records reveal that Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as \"Political Phenomenon, Jews and the Treaty of Versailles\". At the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000.\n\nIn June 1921, while Hitler and Dietrich Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful: at a general membership meeting, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, with only one nay vote cast.\n\nOn 14 September 1921, Hitler and a substantial number of SA members and other Nazi Party adherents disrupted a meeting at the Löwenbräukeller of the Bavarian League. This federalist organization objected to the centralism of the Weimar Constitution, but accepted its social program. The League was led by Otto Ballerstedt, an engineer whom Hitler regarded as \"my most dangerous opponent.\" One Nazi, Hermann Esser, climbed upon a chair and shouted that the Jews were to blame for the misfortunes of Bavaria, and the Nazis shouted demands that Ballerstedt yield the floor to Hitler. The Nazis beat up Ballerstedt and shoved him off the stage into the audience. Both Hitler and Esser were arrested, and Hitler commented notoriously to the police commissioner, \"It's all right. We got what we wanted. Ballerstedt did not speak.\" Hitler was eventually sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and ended up serving only a little over one month.\n\nOn 4 November 1921, the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbräuhaus. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a melee in which a small company of SA defeated the opposition.\n\nIn 1922 and early 1923, Hitler and the NSDAP formed two organizations that would grow to have huge significance. The first began as the \"Jungsturm Adolf Hitler\" and the \"Jugendbund der NSDAP\"; they would later become the Hitler Youth. The other was the \"Stabswache\" (Staff Guard), which in May 1923 was renamed the \"Stoßtrupp-Hitler\" (Shock Troop-Hitler). This early incarnation of a bodyguard unit for Hitler would later become the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS).\nInspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome in 1922, Hitler decided that a \"coup d'état\" was the proper strategy to seize control of the country. In May 1923, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry, but the order to march never came.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Hitler led the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempted \"coup d'état\" on 8–9 November 1923. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup. Hitler was arrested on 11 November 1923. Hitler was put on trial for high treason, gaining great public attention.\n\nThe rather spectacular trial began in February 1924. Hitler endeavored to turn the tables and put democracy and the Weimar Republic on trial as traitors to the German people. Hitler was convicted and on 1 April sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. Hitler received friendly treatment from the guards; he had a room with a view of the river, wore a tie, had regular visitors to his chambers, was allowed mail from supporters and was permitted the use of a private secretary. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.\n\nHitler used the time in Landsberg Prison to consider his political strategy and dictate the first volume of Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"; originally entitled \"Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice\"), principally to his deputy Rudolf Hess. After the putsch the party was banned in Bavaria, but it participated in 1924's two elections by proxy as the National Socialist Freedom Movement. In the German election, May 1924 the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.55% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the German election, December 1924 the National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB) (Combination of the \"Deutschvölkische Freiheitspartei\" (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party.\n\nThe Barmat Scandal was often used later in Nazi propaganda, both as an electoral strategy and as an appeal to anti-Semitism.\n\nHitler had determined, after some reflection, that power was to be achieved not through revolution outside of the government, but rather through legal means, within the confines of the democratic system established by Weimar.\n\nFor five to six years there would be no further prohibitions of the party (\"see below\" Seizure of Control: (1931–1933)).\n\nIn the German election, May 1928 the Party achieved just 12 seats in the Reichstag. The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.11%), though in three areas the NSDAP failed to gain even 1% of the vote. Overall the NSDAP gained 2.6% (810,100) of the vote. Partially due to the poor results, Hitler decided that Germans needed to know more about his goals. Despite being discouraged by his publisher, he wrote a second book that was discovered and released posthumously as the \"Zweites Buch\". At this time the SA began a period of deliberate antagonism to the Rotfront by marching into Communist strongholds and starting violent altercations.\n\nAt the end of 1928, party membership was recorded at 130,000. In March 1929, Erich Ludendorff represented the Nazi Party in the Presidential elections. He gained 280,000 votes (1.1%), and was the only candidate to poll fewer than a million votes. The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later the Berlin headquarters of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) itself. In September Goebbels led his men into Neukölln, a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire.\n\nThe German referendum of 1929 was important as it gained the Nazi Party recognition and credibility it never had before.\n\nOn the evening of 14 January 1930, at around ten o'clock, Horst Wessel was fatally shot at point-blank range in the face by two members of the KPD in Friedrichshain. The attack occurred after an argument with his landlady who was a member of the KPD, and contacted one of her Rotfront friends, Albert Hochter, who shot Wessel. Wessel had penned a song months before which would become a Nazi anthem as the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\". Goebbels seized upon the attack (and the weeks Wessel spent on his deathbed) to publicize the song, and the funeral was used as an anti-Communist propaganda opportunity for the Nazis. In May Goebbels was convicted of \"libeling\" President Hindenburg and fined 800 marks. It stemmed from a 1929 article by Goebbels in his newspaper \"Der Angriff\". In June, Goebbels was charged with high treason by the prosecutor in Leipzig based on statements Goebbels had made in 1927, but after a four-month investigation it came to naught.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Hitler's party gained a victory in the Reichstag, obtaining 107 seats (18.3%, 6,409,600 votes) in September, 1930. The Nazis became the second largest party in Germany. In Bavaria the party gained 17.9% of the vote, though for the first time this percentage was exceeded by most other provinces: Oldenburg (27.3%), Braunschweig (26.6%), Waldeck (26.5%), Mecklenburg-Strelitz (22.6%), Lippe (22.3%) Mecklenburg-Schwerin (20.1%), Anhalt (19.8%), Thuringen (19.5%), Baden (19.2%), Hamburg (19.2%), Prussia (18.4%), Hessen (18.4%), Sachsen (18.3%), Lubeck (18.3%) and Schaumburg-Lippe (18.1%).\n\nAn unprecedented amount of money was thrown behind the campaign. Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where NSDAP campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. The Great Depression was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success. Against this legal backdrop, the SA began its first major anti-Jewish action on 13 October 1930 when groups of brownshirts smashed the windows of Jewish-owned stores at Potsdamer Platz.\n\nThe Wall Street Crash of 1929 heralded worldwide economic disaster. The Nazis and the Communists made great gains at the 1930 Election. Both the Nazis and Communists between them secured almost 40% of Reichstag seats, which required the moderate parties to consider negotiations with anti-democrats. \"The Communists\", wrote Bullock, \"openly announced that they would prefer to see the Nazis in power rather than lift a finger to save the republic\".\n\nThe Weimar political parties failed to stop the Nazi rise. Germany's Weimar political system made it difficult for chancellors to govern with a stable parliamentary majority, and successive chancellors instead relied on the president's emergency powers to govern. From 1931 to 1933, the Nazis combined terror tactics with conventional campaigning – Hitler criss-crossed the nation by air, while SA troops paraded in the streets, beat up opponents, and broke up their meetings.\n\nA middle-class liberal party strong enough to block the Nazis did not exist – the People's Party and the Democrats suffered severe losses to the Nazis at the polls. The Social Democrats were essentially a conservative trade union party, with ineffectual leadership. The Catholic Centre Party maintained its voting block, but was preoccupied with defending its own particular interests and, wrote Bullock: \"through 1932-3 ... was so far from recognizing the danger of a Nazi dictatorship that it continued to negotiate with the Nazis\". The Communists meanwhile were engaging in violent clashes with Nazis on the streets, but Moscow had directed the Communist Party to prioritise destruction of the Social Democrats, seeing more danger in them as a rival for the loyalty of the working class. Nevertheless, wrote Bullock, the heaviest responsibility lay with the German right wing, who \"forsook a true conservatism\" and made Hitler their partner in a coalition government.\n\nThe Centre Party's Heinrich Brüning was Chancellor from 1930 to 1932. Brüning and Hitler were unable to reach terms of co-operation, but Brüning himself increasingly governed with the support of the President and Army over that of the parliament. The 84-year-old President von Hindenburg, a conservative monarchist, was reluctant to take action to suppress the Nazis, while the ambitious Major-General Kurt von Schleicher, as Minister handling army and navy matters hoped to harness their support. With Schleicher's backing, and Hitler's stated approval, Hindenburg appointed the Catholic monarchist Franz von Papen to replace Brüning as Chancellor in June 1932. Papen had been active in the resurgence of the Harzburg Front. He had fallen out with the Centre Party. He hoped ultimately to outmaneuver Hitler.\n\nAt the July 1932 Elections, the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag, yet without a majority. Hitler withdrew support for Papen and demanded the Chancellorship. He was refused by Hindenburg. Papen dissolved Parliament, and the Nazi vote declined at the November Election. In the aftermath of the election, Papen proposed ruling by decree while drafting a new electoral system, with an upper house. Schleicher convinced Hindenburg to sack Papen, and Schleicher himself became Chancellor, promising to form a workable coalition.\n\nThe aggrieved Papen opened negotiations with Hitler, proposing a Nazi-Nationalist Coalition. Having nearly outmaneuvered Hitler, only to be trounced by Schleicher, Papen turned his attentions on defeating Schleicher, and concluded an agreement with Hitler.\n\nOn 10 March 1931, with street violence between the Rotfront and SA spiraling out of control, breaking all previous barriers and expectations, Prussia re-enacted its ban on brown shirts. Days after the ban SA-men shot dead two communists in a street fight, which led to a ban being placed on the public speaking of Goebbels, who sidestepped the prohibition by recording speeches and playing them to an audience in his absence.\n\nWhen Hitler's citizenship became a matter of public discussion in 1924 he had a public declaration printed on 16 October 1924: \"The loss of my Austrian citizenship is not painful to me, as I never felt as an Austrian citizen but always as a German only . . . . It was this mentality that made me draw the ultimate conclusion and do military service in the German Army.\" Under the threat of criminal deportation home to Austria, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925, and did not acquire German citizenship until almost seven years later; therefore, he was unable to run for public office. Hitler gained German citizenship after being appointed a Free State of Brunswick government official by Dietrich Klagges, after an earlier attempt by Wilhelm Frick to convey citizenship as a Thuringian police official failed.\n\nErnst Röhm, in charge of the SA, put Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorff, a vehement anti-Semite, in charge of the Berlin SA. The deaths mounted, with many more on the Rotfront side, and by the end of 1931 the SA had suffered 47 deaths, and the Rotfront recorded losses of approximately 80. \nStreet fights and beer hall battles resulting in deaths occurred throughout February and April 1932, all against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler's competition in the presidential election which pitted him against the monumentally popular Hindenburg. In the first round on 13 March, Hitler had polled over 11 million votes but was still behind Hindenburg. The second and final round took place on 10 April: Hitler (36.8% 13,418,547) lost out to Paul von Hindenburg (53.0% 19,359,983) whilst KPD candidate Thälmann gained a meagre percentage of the vote (10.2% 3,706,759). At this time, the Nazi Party had just over 800,000 card-carrying members.\n\nThree days after the presidential elections, the German government banned the NSDAP paramilitaries, the SA and the SS, on the basis of the Emergency Decree for the Preservation of State Authority. This action was largely prompted by details that emerged at a trial of SA men for assaulting unarmed Jews in Berlin. After less than a month the law was repealed on 30 May by Franz von Papen, Chancellor of Germany. Such ambivalence about the fate of Jews was supported by the culture of anti-Semitism that pervaded the German public at the time.\n\nIn the federal election of July 1932, the NSDAP won 37.3% of the popular vote (13,745,000 votes), an upswing by 19 percentage points, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag, holding 230 out of 608 seats. \nDwarfed by Hitler's electoral gains, the KPD turned away from legal means and increasingly towards violence. One resulting battle in Silesia resulted in the army being dispatched, each shot sending Germany further into a potential all-out civil war. By this time both sides marched into each other's strongholds hoping to spark a rivalry. The attacks continued and reached fever pitch when SA leader Axel Schaffeld was assassinated on 1 August. \n\nAs the NSDAP was now the largest party in the Reichstag, they were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag and were able to elect Göring for the post. Energised by the success, Hitler asked to be made chancellor. Hitler was offered the job of vice-chancellor by Chancellor Papen at the behest of President Hindenburg, but he refused. Hitler saw this offer as placing him in a position of \"playing second fiddle\" in the government.\n\nGöring, in his position of Reichstag president, asked that decisive measures be taken by the government over the spate in murders of NSDAP members. On 9 August, amendments were made to the \"Reichstrafgesetzbuch\" statute on 'acts of political violence', increasing the penalty to 'lifetime imprisonment, 20 years hard labour or death'. Special courts were announced to try such offences. When in power less than half a year later, Hitler would use this legislation against his opponents with devastating effect.\n\nThe law was applied almost immediately but did not bring the perpetrators behind the recent massacres to trial as expected. Instead, five SA men who were alleged to have murdered a KPD member in Potempa (Upper Silesia) were tried. Hitler appeared at the trial as a defence witness, but on 22 August the five were convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in early September. They would serve just over four months before Hitler freed all imprisoned Nazis in a 1933 amnesty.\n\nThe Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the November 1932 election, but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.09%). The Social Democrats (SPD) won 121 seats (20.43%) and the Communists (KPD) won 100 (16.86%).\n\nThe Comintern described all moderate left-wing parties as \"social fascists\", and urged the Communists to devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. As a result, the KPD, following orders from Moscow, rejected overtures from the Social Democrats to form a political alliance against the NSDAP.\n\nAfter Chancellor Papen left office, he secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with President Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he, Papen, could be the vice chancellor. Another notable event was the publication of the \"Industrielleneingabe\", a letter signed by 22 important representatives of industry, finance and agriculture, asking Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor.\n\nHindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after the parliamentary elections of July and November 1932 had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party (DNVP). \n\nOn 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring, Minister Without Portfolio (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia). The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin.\nIt is this event that would become termed Hitler's \"Machtergreifung\" (\"seizure of power\"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process, though Hitler, and others, used the word \"\" (\"take-over of power\"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework and suggesting that the process was legal.\n\nPapen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinet – still falsely believing that he could \"tame\" Hitler. Initially, Papen did speak out against some Nazi excesses. However, after narrowly escaping death in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, he no longer dared criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.\n\nBoth within Germany and abroad initially there were few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and \"tame\" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was \"mediocre\" if not a bad copy of Mussolini; even SPD politician Kurt Schumacher trivialized Hitler as a \"Dekorationsstück\" (\"piece of scenery/decoration\") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was \"a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed\" and because of the German nation being proud of \"the freedom of speech and thought\". Theodor Wolff of \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" wrote:\n\nEven within the Jewish German community, in spite of Hitler not hiding his ardent antisemitism, the worries appear to have been limited. In a declaration of January 30, the steering committee of the central Jewish German organization (\"Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens\") wrote that \"as a matter of course\" the Jewish community faces the new government \"with the largest mistrust\", but at the same they were convinced that \"nobody would dare to touch [their] constitutional rights\". The Jewish German newspaper wrote on Jan 31st:\n\nHowever a growing number of keen observers, like Sir Horace Rumbold, British Ambassador in Berlin, began to revise their opinions. On 22 February 1933, he wrote, \"Hitler may be no statesman but he is an uncommonly clever and audacious demagogue and fully alive to every popular instinct,\" and he informed the Foreign Office that he had no doubt that the Nazis had \"come to stay.\" On receiving the dispatch Robert Vansittart, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, concluded that if Hitler eventually gained the upper hand, \"then another European war [was] within measurable distance.\"\n\nWith Germans who opposed Nazism failing to unite against it, Hitler soon moved to consolidate absolute power.\n\nFollowing the Reichstag fire, the Nazis began to suspend civil liberties and eliminate political opposition. The Communists were excluded from the Reichstag. At the March 1933 elections, again no single party secured a majority. Hitler required the vote of the Centre Party and Conservatives in the Reichstag to obtain the powers he desired. He called on Reichstag members to vote for the Enabling Act on 24 March 1933. Hitler was granted plenary powers \"temporarily\" by the passage of the Act. The law gave him the freedom to act without parliamentary consent and even without constitutional limitations.\n\nEmploying his characteristic mix of negotiation and intimidation, Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: \"It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace\". The Centre Party, having obtained promises of non-interference in religion, joined with conservatives in voting for the Act (only the Social Democrats voted against).\n\nThe Act allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenburg remained President. Hitler immediately set about abolishing the powers of the states and the existence of non-Nazi political parties and organisations. Non-Nazi parties were formally outlawed on 14 July 1933, and the Reichstag abdicated its democratic responsibilities. Hindenburg remained commander-in-chief of the military and retained the power to negotiate foreign treaties. \n\nThe Act did not infringe upon the powers of the President, and Hitler would not fully achieve full dictatorial power until after the death of Hindenburg in August 1934. Journalists and diplomats wondered whether Hitler could appoint himself President, who might succeed him as Chancellor, and what the army would do. Hitler combined the two positions, so that all governmental power lay in his hands. All soldiers took the Hitler Oath on the day of Hindenburg's death, swearing \"unconditional obedience\" to Hitler.\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

He was a member of Iran's Supreme National Security Council without assuming any executive position. He was a member of Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution by Ali Khamenei's official order. He became the overseer of the Mausoleum of Khomeini. He spoke against America, Israel and what he called \"exploitative Iranian capitalists,\" on several occasions.\n\nDuring the Iran hostage crisis, he had a \"prominent role\" and made \"tough anti-American statements\". According to the hostages, after Ahmad's visit to the then taken over embassy, he greeted the students and congratulated them for their action. Emphasizing on that some of the hostages were CIA agents based on the discovered documents, he repeated his father's threat \"to put some of the captives on trial for spying\" if the recently toppled Shah was \"not returned to Iran.\"\n\nDuring the war, he had an important role reporting government general issues to his father and relaying the Imam's messages to officials and others. He also used to act as counsel for his father and other high-ranking officials.\n\nOn 29 April 1989, Ahmad Khomeini wrote a \"more than three pages\" letter addressing Ayatollah Monatzeri saying that he was regretful for Monatzeri's being heedless of \"Imam's calls.\" Producing a list of accusations, Ahmad Khomeini tried to show that Montazeri's leadership would be harmful to the revolution. \"Was it not because of your affection for Mehdi Hashemi that you created so many problems for Islam and the revolution?\" said Ahmad Khomeini in a part of the letter. In response, Montazeri defended Mehdi Hashemi, an Iranian Shia cleric who was defrocked later, and said that he would \"stay away from politics.\"\n\nHis wife was Fatemeh Soltani Tabatabai, daughter of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Bagher Soltani Tabatabai Borujerdi, niece of Imam Musa Sadr, the Shia religious leader of Lebanon. She was also the sister of Sadegh Tabatabai.\n\nKhomeini suffered a cardiac arrest on 12 March 1995, and went into a coma. He died five days later, on 17 March 1995, hours after being connected to life support machinery. Iran government announced two days of national mourning after Ahmad Khomeini's death. Ahmad Khomeini is entombed next to his father in a grand shrine south of Tehran, where his son, Hassan Khomeini, is the superintendent.\n\nAt least one author regarded his death as suspicious, stating that \"he died in his sleep\", without mentioning the heart attack five days prior and subsequent coma. According to Assembly of the Forces of Imam's Line, the Tehran times reported that the rumors regarding Ahmad Khomeini's death was originally published by Alireza Nourizadeh, a British spy. His son, Hassan Khomeini confirmed this, calling the rumors \"baseless\" and repeated the claim that they were created by a British spy.\n\nAhmads's father, Ruhollah, described him as such: \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, Current supreme leader of Iran, described him as who solved many problems and did many things throughout the revolution. Khamenei called him capable and a unique and necessary element besides Khomeini. According to Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani, Ahmad was a strong column, a capable arm for the government, supreme leader and the officials.\n\n"}

At the age of eight he was appointed to an honorary position in the King's Musketeers (\"mousquetaires du roi\"). He subsequently entered the French Guards (\"gardes-françaises\"), a regiment permanently stationed in Paris except in time of war.\n\nIn 1776 de Launay succeeded M. de Jumilhac as Governor of the Bastille. As was the custom with many senior positions under the Ancien Régime, the marquis purchased the office of governor from his predecessor as a form of investment. The thirteen years that he spent in this position were uneventful, though on 19 December 1778 he reportedly made the mistake of failing to fire the cannon of the Bastille as a salute on the birth of a daughter (Madame Royale) to King Louis XVI. In August 1785 he was given responsibility for the imprisonment of two prime figures in the royal necklace scandal: Cardinal Louis de Rohan and Jeanne de La Motte-Valois. He behaved correctly and considerately with both, although the latter was an extremely difficult inmate.\n\nUntil 1777 he was Seigneur of Bretonnière in Normandy. De Launay also owned and rented out a number of houses in the \"rue Saint-Antoine\", neighboring the Bastille.\n\nThe permanent garrison of the Bastille, under de Launay, consisted of about 80 \"invalides\" (veteran military pensioners) no longer considered suitable for regular army service. Two days before 14 July they were reinforced by thirty Swiss grenadiers from the Salis-Samade Regiment. \n\nUnlike Sombreuil, the governor of Hôtel des Invalides, who had accepted the revolutionaries' demands earlier that day, de Launay refused to surrender the prison fortress and hand over the arms and the gunpowder stored in the cellars. He promised that he would not fire unless attacked and tried to negotiate with two delegates from the Hôtel de Ville, but the discussions drew out. A part of the impatient crowd started to enter the outer courtyard of the fortress after a small group broke the chains securing the drawbridge. After shouting warnings the garrison opened fire. The besiegers interpreted this as treachery on the part of de Launay. The ensuing fighting lasted about four hours, resulting in about 100 casualties among the exposed crowd but only one death and three wounded amongst the well-protected defenders firing from loopholes and battlements. With no source of water and only limited food supplies within the Bastille, de Launay decided to capitulate on the condition that nobody from within the fortress would be harmed. In a note passed out through an opening in the drawbridge he threatened that he would blow up the entire fortress and the surrounding district if these conditions were rejected. De Launay's conditions were rejected but he nevertheless capitulated, reportedly after members of the garrison prevented him from entering the cellars where the gunpowder was stored. At about 5pm firing from the fortress ceased and the drawbridge was suddenly lowered.\n\nDe Launay was then seized and his sword and baton of rank torn from him. He was supposed to have been taken to the Hôtel de Ville by one of the leaders of the insurrection, soldier (future general) Pierre-Augustin Hulin. However on the way there, the furious crowd assaulted the governor, beat him and eventually killed him by stabbing him repeatedly with their knives, swords and bayonets and shooting him once. The actual killing was reported to have taken place near the Hôtel de Ville when the struggling de Launay, desperate and abused, cried out \"Enough! Let me die.\" and kicked an unemployed cook named Desnot in the groin. After the killing, Launay's head was sawn off by Mathieu Jouve Jourdan, a butcher. It was fixed on a pike to be carried through the streets for some hours before being thrown in the Seine the next day.\nThree officers of the Bastille's permanent garrison and two of their veterans were also lynched while two of the Swiss were unaccounted for. However the majority of the defenders were escorted through the mob by French Guards who had joined the attackers, and eventually released.\n\nThe history writer Simon Schama describes de Launay as a \"reasonably conscientious if somewhat dour\"\nfunctionary who treated prisoners more humanely than his predecessors had done. The Marquis de Sade who had been transferred from the Bastille to another prison shortly before 14 July, commented that de Launay was \"a so-called marquis whose grandfather was a servant\".\n\nThe officer commanding the Swiss detachment sent to reinforce de Launay, Lieutenant Deflue, subsequently accused his late superior of military incompetence, inexperience and irresolution, which he had allegedly displayed before the siege. Deflue's report, which was copied into the log book of his regiment and has survived, may not be fair to de Launay, who was put in an impossible position by the failure of the senior officers commanding the Royal troops concentrated in and around Paris to provide him with effective support. The Marshal de Broglie, who as Minister of War was in overall charge of the abortive efforts to suppress the disturbances of 1789, had however written on 5 July that \"there are two sources of anxiety concerning the Bastille; the person of the commandant (de Launay) and the nature of the garrison there\".\n\nDe Launay had three daughters by two wives. Some of de Launay's brother's descendants settled in Russia (see Boris Delaunay and Vadim Delaunay for details). His killing is described graphically in Charles Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (Book II, Chapter 21) and also in Hilary Mantel's \"A Place of Greater Safety\".\n\n"}

They studied in Paris, France. Having completed his studies Bogumilus was ordained a priest near Dobrów. His uncle, who was the Archbishop of Gniezno, made him the chancellor of Gniezno. Bogumilus succeededed his uncle as Archbishop of Gniezno in 1167. Bogumilus founded a Cistercian abbey at Koronowo.\n\nHe resigned his see in 1172, possibly due to opposition by his clergy to what they viewed as his excessive strictness. Bogumilus then joined the Camaldolese hermits at Uniedow, Poland, where he remained until his death. While on his deathbed, it is believed that Bogumilus saw a vision of the Virgin Mary and Child, surrounded by a throng of angels, who were inviting him to heaven.\n\nThe cult and veneration of Bogumilus began almost immediately after his death, especially in Eastern Poland. Many people prayed for his intercession for things such as health, good livestock and a good catch while fishing. When they were answered, many faithful visited his tomb and it became a place for local pilgrimage. Yet it was not until 1625 that the formal process of beatification began under the Primate of Poland, Archbishop Maciej Łubieński.\n\nThe files were sent to Rome in 1651, however the process was never completed as the \"Book of Miracles\", which was in the hands of a Count, by the name of Sebastian Głębocki, was burned at his court in Głębokie, Kruszwica. In 1788 a small wooden chapel dedicated to Bogumilus was built, in the wetlands of the Rivers Warta and Teleszyny, near Dobrów, and still stands till this day. The process of beatification would remain dormant until 1908, when Stanislaw Zdzitowiecki, the Bishop of Kujawy, reactivated the process. On 27 May 1925 Pope Pius XI proclaimed Bogumilus, as Blessed. Later Pope Paul VI would bestow on Bogumilus the patronage of the Archdiocese of Gniezno.\n\nSome scholars believe that Bogumilus is the amalgamation of two historical figures by the names of Bogumił and Piotr, one of whom was the archbishop and the other a monk or the bishop of Poznań.\n\nThere is no definitive evidence, to support this, however, and most modern historians regard Bogumił Piotr, as one historical person, who is venerated in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn support of this view, it is possible that the archbishop had been christened as Piotr and might have taken the name Bogumił as his monastic name. The support for this theory is the fact that this name already had a place of honor in the Camaldolese Order, as the original Bogumilus was a member of the first monastery of the Order outside of Italy. All the members of this 11th-century community were murdered and are considered martyrs within the Order. An account of their deaths was written by their colleague, Saint Bruno of Querfurt, and the memory of these martyred monks would have been still fresh to the Polish Camaldolese monks of his day.\n"}

Their father was an engineer.\n\nThe three sisters were involved with the nationalist movement in Ireland. This involvement was through the people who lived in and visited their house on a regular basis on the years leading up to the 1916 Easter Rising, like Christopher Byrne and Con Colbert. They joined Cumann na mBan in 1915 and were trained as usual in all the first aid and military training which took place on Harcourt and Camden streets. Along with Byrne and Colbert, Joe McGrath and Phil Cosgrave frequently visited the house and were senior officers in their branches of the Volunteers. The house was used to store ammunition in preparation for the Rising and used as a distribution centre in the days leading up to it. A younger brother, Thomas, was used in the Rising as a runner.\n\nCon Colbert was one of the leaders of the rebellion and was executed by the British for his involvement. He set out for the events of the Easter Rising from the Cooney house in Usher's Quay.\n\nAll three women were members of the Inghinidhe branch of Cumann na mBan. The eldest girl involved was just 18 when they joined the Cumann. They all served in the Marrowbow Lane garrison during the Easter Rising with others like Marcella Cosgrave. Their father was arrested during the Rising when he tried to supply the garrison with food. He was kept in Kilmainham gaol for the duration and for some time after the Rising. He was then sent to Wakefield in Britain before eventually being sent back to Dublin. All three sisters were arrested with the other women after the Rising and sent to Richmond Barracks initially and then on to Kilmainham gaol. They were all released with the others on May 8, 1916.\n\nAfter the Rising all three sisters were involved in the Irish National Aid Association and Volunteer Dependants' Fund, their own family being one of the dependants as a result of their father's arrest.

{"id": "21903606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21903606", "title": "Dahiya doctrine", "text": "Dahiya doctrine\n\nThe Dahiya doctrine or, Dahya doctrine, is a military strategy of asymmetric warfare, outlined by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of General Staff Gadi Eizenkot, which encompasses the destruction of the civilian infrastructure of regimes deemed to be hostile as a measure calculated to deny combatants the use of that infrastructure and endorses the employment of \"disproportionate power\" to secure that end.\n\nThe doctrine is named after the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut, where Hezbollah was headquartered during the 2006 Lebanon War, which were heavily damaged by the IDF.\n\nThe first public announcement of the doctrine was made by general Gadi Eizenkot, commander of the IDF's northern front, in October 2008. He said that what happened in the Dahya (also transliterated as Dahiyeh and Dahieh) quarter of Beirut in 2006 would, \"happen in every village from which shots were fired in the direction of Israel. We will wield disproportionate power against [them] and cause immense damage and destruction. From our perspective, these are military bases. [...] This isn't a suggestion. It's a plan that has already been authorized. [...] Harming the population is the only means of restraining Nasrallah.\"\n\nAccording to analyst Gabi Siboni at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies: \"With an outbreak of hostilities [with Hezbollah], the IDF will need to act immediately, decisively, and with force that is disproportionate to the enemy's actions and the threat it poses. Such a response aims at inflicting damage and meting out punishment to an extent that will demand long and expensive reconstruction processes. Israel's test will be the intensity and quality of its response to incidents on the Lebanese border or terrorist attacks involving Hezbollah in the north or Hamas in the south. In such cases, Israel again will not be able to limit its response to actions whose severity is seemingly proportionate to an isolated incident. Rather, it will have to respond disproportionately in order to make it abundantly clear that the State of Israel will accept no attempt to disrupt the calm currently prevailing along its borders. Israel must be prepared for deterioration and escalation, as well as for a full-scale confrontation. Such preparedness is obligatory in order to prevent long term attrition.\"\n\nNoting that Dahya was the Shia quarter in Beirut that was razed by the Israeli Air Force during the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli journalist Yaron London wrote in 2008 that the doctrine, \"will become entrenched in our security discourse.\"\n\nNaftali Bennett told Haaretz in an interview in March, 2017: \"The Lebanese institutions, its infrastructure, airport, power stations, traffic junctions, Lebanese Army bases – they should all be legitimate targets if a war breaks out. That's what we should already be saying to them and the world now. If Hezbollah fires missiles at the Israeli home front, this will mean sending Lebanon back to the Middle Ages\". He claims that this strategy would will speed up international intervention and shorten the campaign.\n\nSome analysts have argued that Israel implemented such a strategy during the 2008–09 Gaza War, with the Goldstone Report concluding that the Israeli strategy \"designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population\".\n\nOrganizations have argued that economic damage was also pursued, with D9 armoured bulldozers on Palestinian farmland, wrecking 17% of it and leaving 30% of it unusable. A leaked U.S. embassy cable from October 2008, two months prior to the Gaza War, reports that General Gadi Eizenkot in his first interview in four years, discusses Israel's northern, central, and southern regions, and \"labeled any Israeli response to resumed conflict the \"Dahya doctrine\" in reference to the leveled Dahya quarter in Beirut during the 2006 Lebanon War. He said Israel will use disproportionate force upon any village that fires upon Israel.\" The 2009 United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict makes several references to the Dahya doctrine, calling it a concept which requires the application of \"widespread destruction as a means of deterrence\" and which involves \"the application of disproportionate force and the causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations.\" The Fact Finding Mission which submitted the Report concluded that the doctrine had been put into practice during the conflict. However, in a 1 April 2011 op-ed, one of the lead authors of the UN Fact Finding Mission, judge Richard Goldstone stated that some of his conclusions may have been different had the Israeli government cooperated with his team during the investigation. The op-ed has been interpreted by some as a retraction of the report and its conclusions. The retraction was spurned by his three co-authors.\n\nThe doctrine is defined in a 2009 report by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel as follows: \"The military approach expressed in the Dahiye Doctrine deals with asymmetrical combat against an enemy that is not a regular army and is embedded within civilian population; its objective is to avoid a protracted guerilla war. According to this approach Israel has to employ tremendous force disproportionate to the magnitude of the enemy’s actions.\" The report further argues that the doctrine was fully implemented during Operation Cast Lead.\n\nRichard Falk wrote that under the doctrine, \"the civilian infrastructure of adversaries such as Hamas or Hezbollah are treated as permissible military targets, which is not only an overt violation of the most elementary norms of the law of war and of universal morality, but an avowal of a doctrine of violence that needs to be called by its proper name: state terrorism.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9206787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9206787", "title": "Greek refugees", "text": "Greek refugees\n\nGreek refugees is a collective term used to refer to the nearly one million Greek Orthodox natives of Asia Minor, Thrace and the Black Sea areas who fled during the Greek genocide (1914-1922) and Greece's later defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), as well as remaining Greek Orthodox inhabitants of Turkey who were required to leave their homes for Greece shortly thereafter as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which formalized the population transfer and barred the return of the refugees. This Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations was signed in Lausanne, on January 30, 1923 as part of the peace treaty between Greece and Turkey and required all remaining Orthodox Christians in Turkey, regardless of what language they spoke, be relocated to Greece with the exception of those in Istanbul and two nearby islands. Although the term has been used in various times to refer to fleeing populations of Greek descent (primarily after the Ionian Revolt, the Fall of Constantinople or the Greek Civil War), the population strength and the influence of the Asia Minor Greeks in Greece itself, has attached the term to the Anatolian Greek population of the early 20th century. At least 300,000 Greek refugees were from Eastern Thrace, whereas at least 900,000 were from Asia Minor. At least 150,000 were from Istanbul, who left the city in three years before 1928.\n\nThe Orthodox Christian refugees from Asia Minor are usually called in Greek simply Οι Πρόσφυγες (\"Oi Prosfyges\", \"The Refugees\"). Alternative terms used are Οι Μικρασιάτες πρόσφυγες (\"Oi Mikrasiates prosfyges\", \"The Asia Minor refugees\") or Οι πρόσφυγες του '22 (\"Oi prosfyges tou '22\", \"The refugees of 1922\"). Further distinctions are made to denote the refugees from various historic regions of Anatolia: \"Πόντιοι πρόσφυγες\" (\"Pontioi prosfyges\", \"Pontic refugees\") from the Black Sea coast, \"Καππαδόκες πρόσφυγες\" (\"Kappadokes prosfyges\", \"Cappadocian refugees\") from central Turkey, \" Μικρασιάτες πρόσφυγες\" (\"Mikrasiates prosfyges\", \"The refugees from Asia Minor\"), to refer to the Greeks from the geographic area of the peninsula; special reference is made for the \"Refugees from Smyrna\" (\"Oi prosfyges tis Smyrnis\", \"Πρόσφυγες της Σμύρνης\"), since Smyrna was then the second largest Turkish city, and many of the affected Greeks lived there. The refugees from Eastern Thrace are also included.\n\nThe eastern coast of the Aegean was inhabited by Greeks as early as the 9th century BC. Aeolian, Ionian and Dorian colonies were established from the Dardanelles to Caria, with the most important being Miletus, Phocaea, Ephesus and Smyrna. The prominence of the Ionians gave to the region the name Ionia. The Greeks of Asia Minor contributed significantly in the ancient Greek history, from the Ionian Revolt, the Ionian League and the conquests of Alexander the Great, to the Hellenistic kingdoms of Pergamos and Pontus. The Ionians were the first Greek-speaking people that the Persians encountered, and the Persian name for Greece became \"Younan\" or \"Yunan\" (یونان), derived from the word \"Ionia.\" The name spread throughout the Near East and Central Asia.\n\nFollowing the spread of the Hellenistic civilization in the 3rd century BC, Greek became the lingua franca of Asia Minor, and by the fifth century AD, when the last of the Indo-European native languages of Anatolia ceased to be spoken, Greek became the sole spoken language of the natives of Asia Minor.\n\nAfter the founding of Constantinople by the first Christian Roman Emperor Constantine the Great in 330, Asia Minor, the major part of the Greek East, became the most important region of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. For the centuries to follow, the area was the main manpower and wheat source of the state. Numerous invasions and epidemics (especially the Plague of Justinian) devastated the area in various times. However, Asia Minor remained densely populated, compared to the rest of the Medieval world and held the bulk of the empire's Greek speaking orthodox Christian population. Thus, many renowned Greek-speaking figures who lived during this time were Asia Minor Greeks, including Saint Nicholas (270-343), John Chrysostomos (349-407), Isidore of Miletus (6th century), and Basilios Bessarion (1403-1472). The Greek speaking Christian population began to decline with the invasions of the Muslim Seljuq Turks in the 11th century. The establishment of the Seljuk Empire deprived the Byzantines of a large part of Asia Minor. The Fall of Constantinople on May 29, 1453, and the subsequent fall in 1461 of the Greek Empire of Trebizond, located along the eastern Black Sea coast, marked the end of Greek sovereignty in Asia Minor.\n\nThe first centuries of the Ottoman rule were named \"The Dark centuries\" by the Greeks. The custom of the Janissaries and the various restrictions on the religious, economic and social lives of the non-Muslim inhabitants of the Empire constituted an imminent danger for the continuation of the Greek inhabitation of Asia Minor. Conditions were improved over the following centuries, but the Greeks remained in the lower caste status of Dhimmi. Islamization and gradual Turkification continued. The ideas of The Enlightenment and the subsequent Greek War of Independence, raised the hopes of the Asia Minor Greeks for sovereignty. Many Greeks from Anatolia fought as revolutionaries and faced the retaliations of the Sultan.\n\nThe persecutions, massacres, expulsions, and death marches of the Asia Minor Greeks were renewed during the early 20th century by the Young Turk administration of the Ottoman Empire and during the subsequent revolution of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The Ottoman Greek population was severely affected; its misfortunes became known as the Greek Genocide. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I, the Allies granted Greece, with the Treaty of Sèvres, the administration of Eastern Thrace (apart from Constantinople) and the city of Smyrna and its environs. The Pontic Greeks attempted to establish their own republic, the Republic of Pontus. The defeat of the Greek army during the Greco-Turkish War led to what became known in Greece as the Asia Minor Catastrophe. A series of events, with the Great Fire of Smyrna been their peak, ended the 3,000-year-old Greek presence in Asia Minor. The Treaty of Lausanne, which was signed in 1923, anticipated the compulsory exchange of populations. The remaining Greek Orthodox population of Asia Minor and Eastern Thrace, as well as the Muslim population of Greece (the Greeks of Constantinople, Imbros and Tenedos and the Muslims of Western Thrace were excluded) were denaturalized from homelands of centuries or millennia.\n\n1914 Ottoman census, which followed the 1909 census, showed a steep decrease of the Greek population by almost 1 million between these years due to lost of lands (with their population) to Greece after the Balkan Wars. The argument that Greeks constituted the majority of the population of Anatolia claimed by Greece during Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) has been contested by a number of historians. In their book about the British foreign policy of World War I and post war years, Cedric James Lowe and Michael L. Dockrill argued that: \"Greek claims were at best debatable, [they were] perhaps a bare majority, more likely a large minority in the Smyrna Vilayet, which lay in an overwhelmingly Turkish Anatolia.\" The estimations of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Greek state and various Western sources, place their number much higher. The number of Greeks excluded from the population exchange was about 300,000 (270,000 living in Istanbul). There are not exact figures of the refugee population in Greece.\n\nThe first national Greek census after 1923, conducted in 1928, showed the number of the Greeks of Asia Minor origin to be 1,164,267 (probably over 3 million). Some refugees had moved to Russia and the Middle East in previous years. Approximately 250,000 Greek Americans of Asia Minor descent had emigrated to the United States between 1866 and 1917, had American citizenship, and thereby would not become refugees; they would, however, be deprived from their property rights in their ancestral homeland, as well as from their right to return. It is usually estimated that the refugees in Greece numbered approximately 1.5 million people. Descendants of the refugees took part in the great Greek migrations of the Interwar period, as well as the large immigrations to the United States, Australia and Germany in the 1960s-1970s. Today, about 40% of the population of Greece claims full or partial descent from the Asia Minor refugees; as does an almost equal percentage of diasporan Greeks.\n\nThe core of the refugee population settled in Attica and Macedonia. The official refugee population per region in 1928 was as follows (number of refugees and percent of the refugee population):\n\nNumerous suburbs, towns and villages were established to house the additional population of Greece, which rose by about 1/3 in just a few months. These areas are often named Nea (New) followed by the name of the Greek-speaking town or city in Asia Minor that its residents came from. In addition, to this day every town in Greece has a quarter named \"Προσφυγικά\", \"The Refugees' (quarter)\". These new settlements were usually named after the place of origin of their inhabitants:\n\nThis is a list of refugee settlements in Greece (the place of origin is in parentheses)\n\"* denotes settlement that pre-existed, but acquired a large number or refugees\"\nThe arrival of the Asia Minor Greeks resulted in the rise of the agricultural production of the state by 400%. The arable land increased by 55%. The Nikolaos Plastiras Government decided on February 14, 1923 to further divide the arable land of Greece, in order for the refugees and their descendants to be the owners of their own land. The income tax of the Greek state rose by about 400% within 4 years, mainly thanks to the refugees (from 319 million drachmas in 1923, to 1 billion and 173 million in 1927).\n\nGreece managed to increase the homogeneity of the population, especially in Northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace). The urban population increased by far, resulting in the creation of the modern Greek metropolises of Athens and Thessaloniki. New liberal ideas arrived along with the refugees, especially those coming from the cosmopolitan city of Smyrna. The influence of the refugees was particularly important in the cultural field.\n\nThe Greek trade and the exchange rates pushed the Greek economy into a new era of industrialization and development, partly due to the arrival of thousands of \"cheap hands\", manpower of low cost. New industries were established in short time by the skilled refugee population (e.g. carpet industries). In addition, many of them became later successful ship-owners (e.g. Aristotle Onassis).\n\nThe Asia Minor Greeks became an inspiration for the native Greek population during the Interwar period, and fought along with their compatriots in World War II, as well, as they had an active role in the Greek Resistance.\n\nThe Asia Minor Greeks constituted one of the wealthiest groups of the ethnic Greeks anywhere. They held much of the economic life and the trade of Anatolia in their hands. Their expulsion led to the abandonment of thousands of factories and shops in the hands of the newly established Republic of Turkey. According to the Treaty of Lausanne, both states had the obligation to make reparations of the properties of the exchanged populations, an obligation that was never fulfilled, on the expense of mostly the Greek refugees (whose number was three times larger and were wealthier than the agricultural Muslim population of Greece). Unlike the Muslims of Greece, the Asia Minor Greeks were forced to leave without any of their possessions.\n\nRather severe were the demographic changes of the Anatolian Greek population, as well as the changes in the demography of Greece herself. The Young Turks revolution, the Asia Minor Expedition and subsequent Catastrophe, had as a result, apart from the 1.5 million refugees, the death of approximately 1 million ethnic Greek civilians (the most notable case being the Greek genocide) and the hostage of hundreds of thousands of Greek men, who were not allowed to leave Anatolia, but were sent to \"labor battalions\" after the war (it is estimated that as many as 150,000 Greek men from Smyrna were not allowed to go to Greece). The demographic bleeding of the refugee population continued in Greece, where thousands of people (especially women and children) died of diseases. The diseases had also an impact on the native population of the country. Apart from malaria, which caused the death of tens of thousands, diseases that had not appeared in Greece for years (cholera, plague) increased the already high mortality rates.\n\nThe problem of the housing of the refugees was the most imminent. Within the first ten days of October 1922, 50,000 Greeks mainly from Aivali arrived in Lesbos, creating a huge humanitarian problem. During the years 1923–1928, the Greek state built 25,000 houses for the refugees. The \"Institute for the relief of the Refugees\" (ΕΑΠ, EAP) built another 27,000 houses (11,000 only in Attica). The same institute spent an estimated 2,422,961 English pounds in order to house 165,000 refugees in Athens and Thessaloniki.\n\nThe Asia Minor Expedition and Catastrophe, as well as the uprooting of the ethnic Greek population from Anatolia after three thousand years of presence, had an enormous impact on the Greek psyche. The Smyrna Catastrophe has been considered as the worst incident of modern Greek history, and as an incident of the same magnitude as the Fall of Constantinople for the Greeks. The matters related to the refugees halted the Greco-Turkish relations for many decades. The issues concerning the missing Greeks were soon raised in the International Red Cross, without any success and cooperation from the Turkish side. To this day, the Greek citizens who were born in Asia Minor have to apply for a visa in order to enter Turkey (something that does not apply to Greek citizens born in Greece).\n\nThe descendants of the refugees have found hundreds of organizations and institutes in Greece and in the diaspora to promote their civilization and to keep in touch with their roots. Various museums in Greece (such as the Benaki Museum) display artifacts from Asia Minor, Pontus, Cappadocia and Eastern Thrace to denote the Greek presence and emphasize the origins of about 40% of the population of modern Greece.\n\nFor its efforts concerning the relief of the refugees The Greek Red Cross (Croix-Rouge Hellénique) was nominated a total of 19 times from 1923 to 1930 for the Nobel Peace Prize; 16 times in 1923, 2 in 1924 and 1 in 1930. The Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded in 1923 and 1924.\n\n\n\n"}

He left secondary school and got entry-level jobs in the film industry in the mid-1990s. Ritchie eventually went on to direct commercials. In 1995, he directed his first film, \"The Hard Case\", a 20-minute short that impressed investors who backed his first feature film, the crime comedy \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998). He then directed another crime comedy, \"Snatch\" (2000). Ritchie's other films include \"Revolver\" (2005), \"RocknRolla\" (2008), \"Sherlock Holmes\" (2009), and its sequel \"\" (2011).\n\nRitchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the second of two children of Amber (\"née\" Parkinson) and Captain John Vivian Ritchie (b. 1928), former Seaforth Highlanders serviceman and advertising executive. John's father was Major Stewart Ritchie, who died in France, in 1940, during World War II. John's mother was Doris Margaretta McLaughlin (b. 1896), daughter of Vivian Guy McLaughlin (b. 1865) and Edith Martineau (b. 1866), the latter by whom she shares close common ancestors with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. The McLaughlins have a pedigree going back to King Edward I of England. Both Richie's parents remarried to prominent individuals. His father's second marriage was to Shireen Ritchie, Baroness Ritchie of Brompton, a former model and later Conservative politician and life peer. From 1973 until 1980, when they divorced, Ritchie's mother was married to Sir Michael Leighton, 11th Baronet of Loton Park. As a divorcée, she is correctly styled as Amber, Lady Leighton.\n\nRitchie, who is dyslexic, was expelled from Stanbridge Earls School at the age of 15. He has claimed that drug use was the reason for the expulsion; his father has said that it was because his son was caught \"cutting class and entertaining a girl in his room.\"\n\nIn addition to his elder sister Tabitha, a dance instructor, Ritchie has a half-brother, Kevin Baynton, who was born to Amber Parkinson when she was a teenager and given up for adoption.\n\nIn 1998, Ritchie and his father contacted their friend Peter Morton, of the Hard Rock Cafe chain, wondering if he had any potential investors for a debut film. Morton's nephew, Matthew Vaughn, had been studying film production in Los Angeles. Peter informed Vaughn of Ritchie's new film idea, and Vaughn agreed to produce. Matthew, John, Guy and Peter asked their mutual acquaintance, Trudie Styler, to invest in the production of Ritchie's second film production following his 1995 short \"The Hard Case\", which Styler had seen and decided that co-funding the project would be a worthwhile opportunity. The production of the film, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", was completed in about eight months. Released in Great Britain in 1998 to positive reviews, it became an international success. It starred Nick Moran and also introduced actors Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher to worldwide audiences, while launching a new acting career for former footballer Vinnie Jones. Ritchie was introduced to Madonna, whom he would later wed, when the soundtrack for the film was issued on her Maverick Records label. In 2000 Ritchie won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Ritchie created and produced a spin-off television series called \"Lock, Stock...\".\n\nRitchie's second feature film, \"Snatch\", was released in 2000. Originally known as \"Diamonds\", it was another caper comedy, this time backed by a major studio with a cast featuring such major Hollywood names as Brad Pitt, Benicio del Toro and Dennis Farina, along with the returning Statham and Vinnie Jones. Similar to \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" in featuring a complex and inventive storyline in which the characters weave in and out of each other's lives, the film also plays with time as Ritchie had employed to humorous effect in his first feature by depicting particular events from different characters' perspectives: a device which became something of a trademark through many of the director's subsequent films. It currently has a rating of 73% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nFollowing his marriage to Madonna, Ritchie began focusing his filmmaking on his wife, directing her in both a music video (for the song \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", a controversial video that showed Madonna engaging in violent behaviour, directed at men, including T-boning a car with three men in it, tasering and robbing a man at an ATM, scratching a police car and shooting two officers with a water gun, driving her car through a group of men playing street hockey and incinerating a man by throwing a lighter into a pool of gasoline) and a short film, \"Star\", for the BMW films series. Ritchie's next film, also featuring Madonna, was a remake of the 1974 Lina Wertmüller hit \"Swept Away\" (also entitled \"Swept Away\"). Ritchie cast Madonna as a rich, rude socialite who, after a shipwreck, is trapped on a deserted island with a slovenly Communist sailor who humiliates her. Ritchie renamed the woman Amber Leighton after his mother. This film was both a critical and commercial disappointment.\n\nIn 2002, Ritchie conceived a hidden camera show called \"Swag\", for Channel Five in the UK, which turned the table on criminals and opportunists by using stunts to trap them in the act. His next project in 2005, a Vegas-themed heist film entitled \"Revolver\" starring Jason Statham, was critically panned in the US and UK.\n\nIn 2008, Ritchie wrote and directed \"RocknRolla\", a more successful return to crime comedy form with an ensemble cast including Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton, Mark Strong, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, and Toby Kebbell. It was generally received well with a 60% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. He also directed in 2008 a commercial for Nike called \"Take It To The Next Level\", about a young Dutch footballer who signs for Arsenal, showing the progression of his career from his viewpoint, until he makes his debut for the Netherlands. The commercial features cameo appearances from some football players with music by Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nRitchie's \"Sherlock Holmes\" was released on 25 December 2009 with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law starring as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic detective and his indispensable friend Dr. Watson in a distinctly comic action-oriented updating. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed more than $520 million worldwide, becoming Ritchie's most successful film financially. The sequel, \"\", was released on 16 December 2011 and earned an even higher worldwide box office of over $545 million.\n\nIn June 2012, it was announced that Ritchie would direct an adaptation of \"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. On 29 October that year, he produced a game trailer for \"\".\n\nRitchie directed Warner Bros.' \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" as a fairly radical remake of the popular 1960s spy TV series. Filmed in 2013 in London and Italy, the film was not released until August 2015. In January 2014, Warner Bros. set Ritchie to direct \"\" with Charlie Hunnam playing King Arthur by Ritchie's choice. Initially scheduled to be the first of several in a franchise, the film was released in May 2017 but was a box office bomb, so the sequels were cancelled.\n\nIn October 2016, Disney announced that Ritchie had signed on to direct a live-action adaptation of \"Aladdin\".\n\nThe Raindance Film Festival announced in August 2017 that it would be honouring Ritchie with its 2nd annual Auteur Award, describing him as a \"prominent figure\" who breathed \"new life into the British film industry\" with his \"cult crime comedies\".\n\nRitchie started training in Shotokan karate at the age of seven at the Budokwai in London, where he later achieved a black belt in both Shotokan and Judo. He also has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Renzo Gracie. On 18 May 2000, Ritchie was arrested by the police for an alleged assault on a 20-year-old man outside the Kensington home he shared with American singer Madonna, on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm.\n\nOn 22 December 2000, Ritchie married Madonna at Skibo Castle in Scotland. They have a son, Rocco John Ritchie (born 11 August 2000 in Los Angeles) and adopted a Malawian baby boy in 2006, David (born 24 September 2005). Madonna eventually filed for divorce from Ritchie in October 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. On 15 December 2008, Madonna's spokeswoman announced that the singer had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which grant him between £50–60 million ($– million), a figure that includes the value of the couple's London pub and Wiltshire estate in England. This would be one of the largest divorce settlements in British history. Madonna and Ritchie issued a joint statement calling the previous announcement \"misleading and inaccurate.\" The financial details of the settlement remained private. Their marriage was dissolved by District Judge Reid by \"decree nisi\" at the clinical Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. Madonna and Ritchie entered into a custody agreement for Rocco and David, then aged eight and three, respectively, and divided the children's time between Ritchie's London home and Madonna's in New York, where the two were joined by her daughter Lourdes, from a previous relationship.\n\nIn February 2011, a £6m house he owns in London's Fitzrovia was occupied briefly by members of The Really Free School, a squatter organisation.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, Ritchie married model Jacqui Ainsley, whom he had been dating since 2010. They have three children: son Rafael (born 5 September 2011), daughter Rivka, (born 29 November 2012) and son Levi (born 8 June 2014).\n"}

Drawn to literature in the meantime, he took out a B.A. in English (1964: magna cum laude) from California State University at Hayward , and went on to obtain an M.A. (1966) and a Ph.D. (1969), in the same subject from the University of California, Davis.\n\nAfter a stint as English lecturer at Brock University. in St. Catharines, Ontario (1969-1975), Muhawi took up a post at the University of Jordan in Amman (1975-1977), and then went to the West Bank to serve as chair of the department of English at Birzeit University (1978 to 1980). Courtesy Professor in the Comparative Literature\nProgram at the University of Oregon in Eugene (2007).\n\nMuhawi is a world authority on the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, and has translated both his memoir of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the poet's experience of house arrest, detentions in prison and interrogations by Israeli soldiers interrogators.\n\nMuhawi notes that the Balfour Declaration, with its outline of a policy of establishing a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine, referred to the actual historic majority of the population in purely negative terms: indigenous Palestinians were 'non-Jews', as the phrasing in the document, 'the existing non-Jewish population', shows. The paradoxical consequence of this distinction was to transform the native inhabitants into a diaspora people in their own country. Balfour himself duplicated as an historical event what a tribal god, Yahweh had done for the mythical figure of Moses: on both occasions, real and imagined, an external authority, speaking in a tongue unknown to the autochthonous people, promised their land to another people. In addressing the Peel Commission in 1937, Winston Churchill was later to dismissively liken Palestinian claims to their country as equal to those of a dog in a manger: though it might have resided there a long time, 'a higher grade of race' takes over the place. Churchill, Muhawi argues, was following a long line of earlier writers in dumbing down Palestinians to a bestial level, and the tradition was still alive, with Menachem Begin likening Palestinians to cockroaches, and Golda Meir denying them out of existence. The tradition of foreign narratives about Palestine is one wherein the actual realities, especially that of the Palestinian people, are wholly erased by a prior sacred tale, that of the Bible whose language becomes the only significant, and signifying reality, replacing reality itself. Palestine, as experienced by Palestinians, is no longer a place but rather:\na tablet; or rather it is a place only to the extent that it is a tablet upon which holy characters are scribbled. We, the people of Palestine, our customs and manners, are nothing more than representative scribbles on the\nsurface of this tablet.\n\nMuhawi's translation of Mahmoud Darwish's \"Journal of an Ordinary Grief.\" won the 2011 PEN Translation Prize.\n\n\n"}

During trial, he expressed no regret over his actions and said he would have done the same even if the girl was a 3-year-old. His legal team argued that the \"confirmation of the kill\" after a suspect is shot was a standard Israeli military practice to eliminate terrorist threats. Some key witnesses later recanted their testimony. The commander was charged with illegal use of his weapon, conduct unbecoming an officer and perverting the course of justice by an Israeli military court but was found not guilty. Human rights groups cite her death as one of several incidents which illustrate a \"culture of impunity\" in the IDF. \n\nSoldiers said they opened fire on the girl because they initially thought she was planting a bomb, although the tape recording of the radio conversation between soldiers at the scene reveals that, from the beginning, she was identified as a child and at no point was a bomb spoken about nor was she described as a threat. After she was hit, soldiers claimed the unit's commanding officer went up to her and kept on shooting her, despite their pleas to stop. No explosives or weapons were found on the girl's body. A search of her bag revealed that it was filled with textbooks.\n\nAccording to Umar Abu Khalifa, 25, \"Israeli soldiers stormed the area, the girl left the bag and tried to run. Bullets hit the (girl's) bag and then soldiers opened fire on the girl.\"\n\nPalestinian witnesses reported that it was more than an hour before Israeli troops would allow medics to evacuate the body in an ambulance. At least fifteen bullets were found in the girl's body by Palestinian hospital officials.\n\nDr. Mohammed al-Hams, who inspected the child's body told The Guardian newspaper that:\"She has at least 17 bullets in several parts of the body, all along the chest, hands, arms, legs ... The bullets were large and shot from a close distance. The most serious injuries were to her head. She had three bullets in the head.\n\nEhab Hams, an older brother of the slain girl, expressed his distrust of Israeli military justice: \"We demand the prosecution of Iman's killer (but) we do not trust the Israeli judicial system.\" He added, \"My sister was an innocent little girl.\"\n\nA documentary screened nationwide on Ilana Dayan's \"Uvda\" (\"Fact\") investigative program on Israel's Channel 2 aired an audio recording of the internal communications between soldiers at the post at the time of the incident.\n\nAccording to the audio recording, the soldiers of the Givati Brigade identified the victim as \"a girl, about 10 years old\", describing her as looking \"scared to death\". Another soldier is heard saying, \"Our forces are attacking her\", and a lookout says \"One of the positions has taken her down.\" The Givati Brigade company commander, Captain R., is then heard saying \"We operated on her. Yes, it seems she has been hit.\" He later states that he \"verified\" the killing, and clarifies his actions by stating that:\"This is commander. Anything that's mobile, that moves in the zone, even if it's a three-year-old, needs to be killed. Over.\"\n\nIsraeli soldiers interviewed in the documentary, and whose anonymity was maintained, submitted that their commander had knowingly shot the girl in the head at close range and then emptied his magazine of bullets into her body to \"confirm the kill.\" One of the soldiers said: \"We saw her from a distance of 70 meters. She was fired at ... from the outpost. She fled and was wounded.\" The soldiers then explained how while Iman was lying wounded about 70 m from the Israeli guard post, the commander fired two bullets at her head from close range. They added that the commander returned to her body again, put his weapon on the automatic setting, and emptied his entire magazine into her body, disregarding their objections over the walkie-talkie.\n\nOne of the soldiers said:\"We couldn't believe what he had done. Our hearts ached for her. Just a 13-year-old girl ... How do you spray a girl from close range? He was hot for a long time to take out terrorists and shot the girl to relieve pressure.\"\n\nOn 11 October 2004, the BBC reported that Israel's top military prosecutor was investigating the army commander for repeatedly firing at the lifeless body of the young girl. The report stated that according to Haaretz newspaper, \"confirming the kill\" (i.e. shooting combatants at close range to make sure they are dead) goes against Israeli military regulations governing the rules of engagement. On 13 October 2004, CBS reported that the army had suspended the officer during the investigation. On 15 October 2004, it was reported that the officer was cleared of responsibility in the shooting.\n\nThe BBC reported that army officials had accepted the commander's claim that \"he fired into the ground near the girl after coming under fire in a dangerous area,\" but that they did not explain why the officer shot into the ground rather than at the source of the fire.\n\nExcerpts from the army statement read:\"The investigation did not find that the company or the company commander had acted unethically ... The investigation concluded that the behaviour of the company commander from an ethical point of view does not warrant his removal from his position.\"\n\nThe officer was nevertheless temporarily suspended due to his poor relations with the soldiers under his command and operational failures. It was further noted that a decision on his career in the army would be given by the end of the week.\n\nLt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, the army chief of staff, said repeatedly that the officer had acted properly under the circumstances. The Israeli military police launched a separate investigation.\n\nOn 18 November 2004, the Israeli army requested the family's permission to exhume Hams' body. The earlier accusations made by the soldiers against their commanding officer of engaging in the outlawed practice of \"verifying the kill\" had regained currency. The \"Sydney Morning Herald\" reported that it was not known whether the girl was already dead or had merely been wounded before being repeatedly shot again. That same month, the army formally charged the officer with two counts of illegally using his weapon, and one count each of obstruction of justice, conduct unbecoming an officer and improper use of authority.\n\nLt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon conceded that the first military investigation had been \"a grave failure\". The indictment against the officer alleged that the first investigation was the subject of an attempted coverup.\n\nAfter the commencement of the military tribunal, the al-Hams family and the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) petitioned the Israeli High Court of Justice in January 2005 to request that the investigation be turned over to civilian authorities. The court declined the request in February 2005.\n\nReferred to in public only as Lieutenant R., (or Captain R.), the officer maintained that when he reached the girl's body, he came under fire from Palestinian militants at least away and shot at the ground to deter the fire. In an interview with the Associated Press, an Israeli military official stated that a soldier in the observation tower claimed the officer's fire was aimed at the girl's body and could offer no explanation as to why the officer shot into the ground rather than at the source of the fire.\n\nLieutenant R. was released from custody in February 2005 after a key prosecution witness, another IDF lieutenant, who had told the military police investigation that he saw R. fire two individual bullets, followed by a volley, into Al-Hams' body, recanted his testimony under intensive cross examination. Earlier, another lookout also retracted parts of his initial testimony against R, attributed by human rights groups to heavy behind-the-scenes military pressure.\n\nOn 15 November 2005, a military tribunal acquitted Captain R., clearing him of all the charges against him.\n\nUpon hearing the verdict, Captain R., burst into tears and turned to the public benches and said: \"I told you I was innocent.\"\n\nIman's father, Samir al-Hams, responded to the verdict by saying that from the outset there was no intention to hold the officer accountable:\"They did not charge him with Iman's murder, only with small offences, and now they say he is innocent of those even though he shot my daughter so many times ... This was the cold-blooded murder of a girl. The soldier murdered her once and the court has murdered her again. What is the message? They are telling their soldiers to kill Palestinian children.\"\n\nThe Palestinian National Authority condemned the verdict.\n\nIn February 2006, Ha'aretz newspaper reported that a military police internal investigation found that there were major failures in the October 2004 investigation into the killing of al-Hams.\n\nTwo reservist officers appointed by Military Police Commander Brigadier General Roni Benny to examine the military police's conduct during the investigation determined that investigators acted unprofessionally and with negligence. The two officers criticized the decision not to appoint a special investigation team led by higher-ranking, more experienced officials and also noted that the incident was not appropriately documented by the investigation. The military police officer in charge of the investigation was reprimanded and the head of the investigation team was censured.\n\nSubsequent to his acquittal, Captain R. was promoted to the rank of major. In March 2006, he received 82,000 New Israel Shekels (roughly $17,000) to compensate him for the cost of his defense and time spent in jail. Captain R. also filed a libel suit against Ilana Dayan and the Telad production company.\nThe district court accepted the suit and awarded him 300,000 shekels in damages. The decision was overturned in part by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Telad should pay only 100,000. The court ruled Dayan did not know that Captain R. was unaware that he was pursuing a child, and so should not be held liable for the news report.\n\nIn 2010 a Jerusalem district court found the claim that \"Captain R.\" had shot Al Hams multiple times to \"verify\" her death, made by Ilana Dayan in her \"Uvda\" (Fact) TV show on Telad, to be libelous, and required them to air a correction and for Telad to pay NIS 300,000. A 2012 decision by the Israeli Supreme Court acquitted Dayan and reduced the damages to NIS 100,000, finding that the statements were \"correct at the time of their broadcast\", based on honest belief, verified facts and credible sources. The court found that \"Captain R\" had been unaware that the death he was running out to verify had been that of a 13-year-old girl, but that Ilana Dayan was unaware of this.\n\n\n"}

Lawton\n\nJonathan Frederick Lawton (born August 11, 1960) is an American screenwriter, producer and director. His screen credits include the box office hit \"Pretty Woman\", \"Mistress\", \"Blankman\", \"Under Siege\", \"\", \"The Hunted\", \"Chain Reaction\", \"\", \"Jackson\", and the TV series \"V.I.P.\" Under the assumed name \"J.D. Athens\", he wrote and directed \"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\" and \"Pizza Man\".\n\nLawton was born in Riverside, California. He is the son of author and novelist Harry Lawton and Georgeann Leona Lawton (née Honegger), a pianist. The couple met in Berkeley while attending the University of California. They later moved to Riverside, where Harry was hired as a reporter for The Press-Enterprise.\n\nAs a child, he suffered from severe dyslexia making school life very difficult. It took him many years of practice and hard work to control his learning disabilities. Despite the challenge, he decided to become a writer like his father. Harry Lawton made sure to give him as much incentive as possible. To this day Lawton credits his father for always being supportive of him, and his mother for going the extra mile to help him overcome his obstacles.\n\nWhen Lawton was still in elementary school, his father's novel, \"Willie Boy: A Desert Manhunt\", was made into a film starring Robert Redford. During the making of \"Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here\", Harry Lawton would take J.F. to the set, exposing him to the process of filmmaking. From that moment on, fascinated, he determined that he would become a screenwriter. Always curious, Lawton would observe his surroundings and write about them, although due to his dyslexia, it would take him double the time to put his stories down on paper.\n\nIn high school, he continued to write short stories, plays, and scripts. After graduating from John W. North High School in Riverside, he enrolled at California State University in Long Beach to study filmmaking. There he wrote, directed and edited two short films, \"The Artist\" and \"Renaissance\". The first was a futuristic thriller placed in which the main character kills his victims, takes their pictures and puts them in his art exhibitions. The second, \"Renaissance\", was a short horror film in which a sadistic sexual predator, dominates and kills his victim every night, but revives her the next morning only to start the cycle all over again. Both shorts won awards on the college circuit.\n\nAfter college, the California native moved to Los Angeles, settling near Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue, one of the toughest areas of Los Angeles at the time. Living among prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, junkies and the homeless, the setting gave Lawton a wide range of inspiration for his stories. He wrote a number of screenplays while working at several post-production companies.\n\nDuring that time he met producer Charles Band, for whom he would direct his first feature film. \"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\" is a take-off of both Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" and Francis Ford Coppola's feature \"Apocalypse Now\". Shot in less than two weeks in his hometown of Riverside, the film starred his longtime friend, comedian Bill Maher, Playboy Playmate Shannon Tweed and horror actoress Adrienne Barbeau. It became a cult favorite and late-night cable staple.\n\nAfter \"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\", Lawton also wrote and directed \"Pizza Man\", a political satire about a delivery man investigating a comical government conspiracy. Talk show host Bill Maher also stars in \"Pizza Man\", along with comedian Annabelle Gurwitch. In both movies, he used the pseudonym J.D. Athens.\n\nHis script for the film \"Three Thousand\" was accepted by the Sundance Institute in the late 1980s. Executives at Touchstone Pictures, a division of The Walt Disney Studios, became interested in making the movie. He changed the title to \"Pretty Woman\", and with over $400 million in worldwide box\noffice, the movie became the largest grossing live-action film in Disney history. Directed by Garry Marshall, with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, the film is a story about Vivian Ward, a prostitute who is hired by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, to be at his beck and call for one week while he is in town on business. Although they come from different backgrounds and lifestyles, they end up developing a relationship based more on genuine love than money and convenience. \"Pretty Woman\" was a huge success and got Lawton nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award and a British Academy Award for his screenplay. Julia Roberts won a Golden Globe Award for her role and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nLawton was given an executive producer credit for his next original screenplay, \"Under Siege\", based on his million-dollar spec script \"Dreadnought\". The idea came when Lawton, who had served time in the Coast Guard Reserve, read that the Navy was retiring the . The film stars Steven Seagal as a disgraced Navy Seal working as a cook on a battleship. Seagal's character must face off against a psychopathic ex-CIA agent (Tommy Lee Jones), who leads a group of mercenaries on a takeover of the battleship on its final voyage, so he can steal its arsenal of nuclear Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. A successful sequel followed: \"\".\n\nWith Barry Primus, Lawton co-wrote \"Mistress\", a comedy starring Robert De Niro, Danny Aiello, Christopher Walken and Martin Landau. The movie is about a Hollywood screenwriter, Marvin Landisman, whose career is going downhill until he meets a has been hustler-producer who tries to help him get his career back. Starring an all-star cast, \"Mistress\" was one of the first films produced by Tribeca Productions, Robert De Niro's production company, and it was released in the summer of 1992.\n\nLawton worked with radio host and media personality Howard Stern on the script for \"The Adventures of Fartman\", a fictional superhero character created by Stern for \"The Howard Stern Show\". With two major studios willing to produce, the movie was put into hold due to a MPAA Film Rating System dispute, as Lawton and Stern felt the content of the film was better suited for a mature audience, and wanted an R-rating for the film instead of a PG-13 rating. The film was put on hold, and Howard Stern included a five-page Fartman story in comics form in his 1995 book, \"Miss America\", which was based on Lawton's script. The book reached number one on the New York Times Best Seller list within days of its release.\n\nFor Columbia Pictures he co-wrote the 1994 film \"Blankman\", a film starring and produced by Damon Wayans who plays Darryl, a nerdy, comical ghetto superhero with a pure heart ready to fight criminals in his own style. The film also stars Jason Alexander, who previously had worked with Lawton in \"Pretty Woman\", and Greg Kinnear early in his\ncareer.\n\nLawton went on to write and direct \"The Hunted\" (1995), a thriller set in Japan starring Christopher Lambert, John Lone and Joan Chen. Written and directed by Lawton, the movie traces Paul Racine, a computer-chip executive from New York in one of his many business trips to Tokyo. Local authorities and a legendary ninja cult get involved in an electric chase after a crime occurs in a hotel room. \"The Hunted\" was released on February 25, 1995 and distributed by Universal Studios. The score, featuring music by acclaimed Japanese taiko troupe Kodo, was especially requested by Lawton.\n\nLawton's next film project was the 1996 action thriller \"Chain Reaction\", which starred Morgan Freeman, Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz. Filmed in Chicago, Illinois, the movie was released on August 2, 1996, and grossed over $60 million worldwide.\n\nIn 1998 Lawton created and executive produced Sony Pictures Entertainment hit syndicated show \"V.I.P.\" through a successful four-year run until 2002. The adventure series starred Pamela Anderson as Vallery Irons, a small-town girl who comes to Southern California looking for a break when she stumbles into the glamorous role of heading up a Beverly Hills bodyguard agency called Vallery Irons Protection. The series saw Anderson often poking fun at her tabloid image,\n\nIn 2006, Lawton co-wrote for Paramount Pictures a film based on the video game series \"\", starring Eric Roberts, Jaime Pressly and Devon Aoki.\n\nLawton wrote and directed the 2008 film \"Jackson\", a comedy-drama-musical starring Barry Primus, Charlie Robinson, Steve Guttenberg, Debra Jo Rupp and opera singers Ella Lee, Shawnette Sulker and Clamma Dale. The movie takes place on a single day involving two homeless men surviving on Los Angeles's Skid Row. Lawton wrote two songs for the movie, \"Downtown Birthday\" and \"Love Cannot Be\". \"Jackson\" was shot mainly in Downtown Los Angeles, except for one scene shot in Kentucky.\n\nLawton suffers from dyslexia and ADHD, and is an avid advocate for charities related to both issues. He is also a supporter of PETA, along with his good friends Bill Maher and Pamela Anderson. Environmental issues, human rights, cancer, poverty and 9-11 are very close to his heart.\n\nHe is married to journalist, writer and LGBT activist Paola Lawton.\n\n\n"}

He attended Phillips Exeter and Byfield Academies, and then went to sea as clerk on the U.S.S. Crescent. He served two years as secretary to the United States Consul at Algiers. He then joined his parents (who had migrated to Bangor, Maine), engaging in mercantile pursuits and serving as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1806–1811) for the District of Maine.\n\nCarr was elected as a Federalist to the Fourteenth United States Congress (1815–1817), the second person from Bangor to occupy that office (following his father).\n\nCarr was drowned in the Ohio River on August 24, 1818. While traveling with his family on a steamboat, his 9-year-old daughter Mary fell overboard just below Louisville, Kentucky, and Carr entered the water in a failed attempt to save her. Neither of their bodies were ever recovered, though a memorial to Carr was erected at Bangor's Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nCarr was married to Betsey Stelle Jarvis, who migrated to Illinois along with two brothers following the tragedy on the river.

{"id": "30372228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30372228", "title": "Jared Lee Loughner", "text": "Jared Lee Loughner\n\nJared Lee Loughner (; born September 10, 1988) is an American mass murderer who pled guilty to 19 charges of murder and attempted murder in connection with the January 8, 2011 Tucson shooting, in which he shot and severely injured U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, his target, and killed six people, including Chief U.S. District Court Judge John Roll, as well as a nine-year-old bystander, Christina-Taylor Green. Loughner shot and injured a total of 13 people, while one man was injured while subduing him.\n\nAcquaintances say that Loughner's personality had changed markedly in the years prior to the shooting, a period during which he was also abusing alcohol and drugs. He had been suspended from Pima Community College in September 2010 because of his bizarre behavior and disruptions in classes and the library. After his arrest, two medical evaluations diagnosed Loughner with paranoid schizophrenia and ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He was placed on medication while in jail, as part of his treatment. He was again judged incompetent in May 2012.\n\nIn August 2012, Loughner was judged competent to stand trial, and at the hearing, he pleaded guilty to 19 counts. In November 2012, he was sentenced to life plus 140 years in federal prison.\n\nJared Lee Loughner is the only child of Randy and Amy (née Totman) Loughner. They were described by a neighbor as a very private family. Amy Loughner worked for the City Parks Department. Randy Loughner was a retired gasoline truck driver, but journalists did not determine if he worked outside the house at the time of the shooting. While Loughner had friends in high school, neighbors noted that in the following years, he kept more to himself and rarely spoke to others.\n\nLoughner attended Mountain View High School, and dropped out in 2006. Around this time, when he was about eighteen years old, those who knew him noted a change in his personality. Kelsey Hawkes, who dated Loughner for several months in high school, later said she was shocked after hearing of his arrest. \"I've always known him as the sweet, caring Jared,\" said Hawkes, 21, then a student at the University of Arizona.\n\nAt some point, Loughner was fired from his job at a Quiznos restaurant, with his manager saying he had undergone a personality transformation. After this, Loughner briefly volunteered at a local animal shelter, walking dogs, but he was eventually asked not to return. The shelter manager later said, \"He was walking dogs in an area we didn't want dogs walked...he didn't understand or comprehend what the supervisor was trying to tell him. He was just resistant to that information.\"\n\nLoughner's former classmate and friend Tong Shan stated that her last encounter with Loughner was in October 2010, after he was suspended and dropped out of college and just before he purchased the semi-automatic handgun used in the massacre. She said that while Loughner was \"anti-government,\" he never appeared violent, nor did he mention his plans to buy a gun.\n\nAccording to court records, Loughner had two previous offenses: in October 2007, he was cited in Pima County for possession of drug paraphernalia and on October 13, 2008, he was charged after defacing a street sign in Marana, near Tucson (a charge that was dismissed following the completion of a diversion program in March 2009). The police report noted that he drew a stylized CX, which Laughner said were Christian symbols.\n\nZach Osler, a high-school classmate of Loughner's and his closest friend, indicated that Loughner's life began to unravel after his high-school girlfriend broke up with him. He began to abuse alcohol and other drugs, including cannabis (marijuana), cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms, LSD, and \"Salvia divinorum\" (a hallucinogen legal in Arizona).\n\nAfter struggling with drugs for more than two years, Loughner gave up alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs in late 2008 and has not used since, according to one of his longtime friends. The U.S. Army confirmed that Loughner had been rejected as \"unqualified\" for service in 2008. According to military sources, Loughner admitted to marijuana use on numerous occasions during the application process.\n\nFormer classmate Caitie Parker remembers Loughner as a \"pot head\". Loughner has a history of drug use, having been arrested in September 2007 for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. \"I haven't seen him in person since '07,\" Parker recalled in early 2011. \"I'm looking back at this [as] a 14–19 year old...who knows if any of us knew what for sure we were yet.\"\n\nIn the months leading up to the shooting, Loughner's parents became increasingly alarmed at their son's behavior, at one point resorting to disabling his car every night in order to keep him at home. On one occasion, his father confiscated his shotgun and both parents urged him to get help. Loughner also became obsessed with controlling what he perceived to be lucid dreams.\n\nFrom February to September 2010, while a student at Pima Community College, Loughner had five contacts with college police for classroom and library disruptions. Some of his teachers complained to the administration about his disruptions and bizarre behavior, as they thought it a sign of mental illness and feared what he might do. On September 29, 2010, college police also discovered a YouTube video shot by Loughner, in which his spoken commentary stated that the college was illegal according to the United States Constitution. He described his school as \"one of the biggest scams in America\".\n\nThe college decided to suspend Loughner and sent a letter to his parents, to consult with them and him together. The college told Loughner that if he wanted to return, he needed to resolve his code of conduct violations and obtain a mental health clearance (indicating, in the opinion of a mental health professional, that his presence did not constitute a danger to himself or others). On October 4, Loughner and his parents met with campus administrators and Loughner indicated he would withdraw from the college. During Loughner's time at Pima, a classmate said she worried that he might commit a school shooting. One of his teachers has claimed a similar suspicion after the Tucson shooting. He never submitted to a mental health evaluation and did not return to the college.\n\nSeveral college classmates recalled an incident in which Loughner, during a class discussion, had mocked and laughed at a young woman who was describing her abortion. One classmate described Loughner's reaction as \"wildly inappropriate\". started making comments about terrorism and laughing about killing the baby,\" former classmate Don Coorough recalled to ABC News. Yet another classmate, Lydian Ali, recalled that \"a girl had written a poem about an abortion. It was very emotional and she was teary eyed and he said something about strapping a bomb to the fetus and making a baby bomb out of it.\"\n\nRecords show that Loughner was registered as an independent and voted in 2006 and 2008, but not in 2010.\n\nLoughner's high-school friend Zach Osler said, \"He did not watch TV; he disliked the news; he didn't listen to political radio; he didn't take sides; he wasn't on the Left; he wasn't on the Right.\"\nA former classmate, Caitie Parker, who attended high school and college with Loughner, described his political views – prior to his 2007 personality transformation – as \"left wing, quite liberal.\" The tone of Loughner's online writings and videos from immediately before the attack were described by an opinion piece of The Guardian as \"almost exclusively conservative and anti-government, with echoes of the populist campaigning of the Tea Party movement\".\n\nMark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center said that Loughner's position that currency not backed by a gold or silver standard is worthless was a \"hallmark of the far right and the militia movement.\" Jesse Walker of the American libertarian magazine \"Reason\" expressed deep skepticism at the connections drawn by Potok. In the aftermath of the shooting, the Anti-Defamation League reviewed messages by Loughner, and concluded that there was a \"disjointed theme that runs through Loughner's writings\", which was a \"distrust for and dislike of the government.\" It \"manifested itself in various ways\" – for instance, in the belief that the government used the control of language and grammar to brainwash people, the notion that the government was creating \"infinite currency\" without the backing of gold and silver, or the assertion that NASA was faking spaceflights.\n\nAccording to a former friend, Bryce Tierney, Loughner had expressed a longstanding dislike for Gabrielle Giffords. Tierney recalled that Loughner had often said that women should not hold positions of power. He repeatedly derided Giffords as a \"fake\". This belief intensified after he attended her August 25, 2007 event when she did not, in his view, sufficiently answer his question: \"What is government if words have no meaning?\" Loughner kept Giffords' form letter, which thanked him for attending the 2007 event, in the same box as an envelope which was scrawled with phrases like \"die bitch\" and \"assassination plans have been made\". Zane Gutierrez, a friend, later told \"The New York Times\" that Loughner's anger would also \"well up at the sight of President George W. Bush, or in discussing what he considered to be the nefarious designs of government.\"\n\nHis friend Zach Osler noted that conspiracy theories had a profound effect on Loughner. He was a member of the message board \"Above Top Secret\", which discusses conspiracy theories; members of the site did not respond warmly to posts believed to be from his account. Loughner espoused conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks, the New World Order, and believed in a 2012 apocalypse, among other controversial viewpoints. Reports appearing after the shooting noted similarities between the statements made by Loughner and those publicized by the far-right conspiracy theorist David Wynn Miller. The Anti-Defamation League's report also confirmed Loughner's longstanding interest in conspiracy theories.\n\nJournalists had speculated that Loughner was anti-Semitic due to his attack on Rep. Giffords, who is Jewish, but the Anti-Defamation League's analysis of the messages by Loughner found that he had a more generalized dislike of religion, and of government. A police report noted that he had previously been caught making graffiti associated with Christian anti-abortion groups.\n\nLoughner has been described as an anti-theist by those who knew him. Loughner declined to state his religion in his Army application. In his \"Final Thoughts\" video, Loughner stated, \"No, I don't trust in God!\", in reference to the United States national motto printed on coins and paper currency, \"In God We Trust\". He expressed a dislike for all religions, and he was particularly critical of Christians.\n\nLoughner allegedly purchased the 9mm Glock pistol used in the shooting from a Sportsman's Warehouse in Tucson on November 30, 2010. The night before the shooting, at 2:05 a.m. he left a message on a friend's voicemail saying, \"Hey man, it's Jared. Me and you had good times. Peace out. Later.\" In a MySpace post the morning of the shooting at 4:12 am, he wrote, \"Goodbye friends. Please don't be mad at me. The literacy rate is below 5%. I haven't talked to one person who is literate. I want to make it out alive. The longest war in the history of the United States. Goodbye. I'm saddened with the current currency and job employment. I had a bully at school. Thank you. P.S. --plead the fifth!\"\n\nThe MySpace page showed a close-up photo of a handgun sitting atop a document titled \"United States History.\"\n\nOn January 8, 2011, at 7:04 a.m. MST, Loughner went to a Walmart store near the Foothills Mall to purchase ammunition, but left that store and completed his purchase at Walmart on North Cortaro Road at 7:28 a.m. He was stopped by Arizona Game and Fish Department officer Alen Edward Forney at 7:34 a.m. for running a red light, but once the officer determined there were no outstanding warrants for Loughner, he was allowed to proceed to his destination with a warning to drive carefully. Loughner took a taxi to a Safeway supermarket location in Casas Adobes, where Rep. Giffords was holding a constituents meeting. The shooting occurred at 10:10 a.m. MST.\n\nLoughner opened fire on Giffords from close range, hitting her as well as numerous bystanders, and killing six people. Thirteen other people were injured by gunfire, and one person was injured while fleeing the scene of the shooting. Giffords, the apparent target of the attack, was shot in the head and critically injured.\n\nLoughner was stopped by bystanders and was arrested by police, saying, \"I plead the Fifth,\" as he was taken into custody. A photograph taken by the Pima County Sheriff's Office's forensic unit was released to the media on January 10, 2011 and published on front pages nationwide. \"The Washington Post\" described Loughner's expression in the photo as \"smirking and creepy, with hollow eyes ablaze,\" while the art director for \"The New York Times\" said the photo was featured on the front page because it \"was the picture of the day [...] it was intense and arresting. It invited you to look and study, and wonder.\"\n\nLoughner was charged in federal court with one count of attempted assassination of a member of Congress, two counts of murder of a federal employee (Giffords' aide and Judge Roll), and two counts of attempting to murder a federal employee, based on his injury of two of Giffords' aides. He was indicted on three of the charges on January 19, 2011. Loughner was held without bail in the Federal Correctional Institution at Phoenix, kept isolated from other inmates 23 hours a day and allowed out of his cell for one hour a day to shower and exercise. On February 24, 2011, he was transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Tucson.\n\nAttorney Judy Clarke, a former federal public defender who in the past had represented suspects in several high-profile murder and terrorism cases, was appointed to represent Loughner in federal court. The entire federal judiciary of Arizona recused themselves from hearing the case because of their ties to fellow judge John Roll, who was killed. Federal prosecutors opposed motions to move the case outside of Arizona because of pre-trial publicity. At the direction of Ninth Circuit Appeals court Chief Judge Kozinski, the federal case was assigned to Larry Alan Burns, a San Diego-based judge from the Southern District of California.\n\nProsecutors representing the State of Arizona, which has concurrent jurisdiction in the matter, announced they intended to file murder and attempted murder charges on behalf of the other victims, those who were not members of Congress or federal employees (although they could legally file charges on behalf of all the victims). Arizona state prosecutors normally have ten days from the time a suspect is brought into custody to file charges, but time spent in federal custody does not count towards this limitation. Arizona law does not permit a verdict of \"not guilty by reason of insanity\", but does allow for a verdict of \"guilty but insane.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2011, Loughner appeared at the Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse in Phoenix, before Judge Larry Alan Burns from San Diego. Loughner, whose hair had partially regrown since his arrest, smiled while presented with the charges related to the shooting, including the attempted killing of Giffords and two of her aides. Loughner's attorney, Judy Clarke, requested that Judge Burns select a plea on her client's behalf, to which a plea of not guilty was recorded. When Burns asked Clarke if Loughner understood the charges against him, she replied that they were \"not raising that issue\" at the time. She did not object to a request by prosecutors to have future hearings moved back to Tucson. On March 3, 2011, a federal grand jury indicted Loughner on additional charges of murder and attempted murder for a total of 49 counts. On March 9, 2011, Loughner pleaded not guilty to all 49 charges.\n\nOn May 25, 2011, Judge Burns stated, \"I got some letters declaring some conflict with his counsel...I intend to table them at this time. At such a point that his competency is restored, if he wants to bring up the matter of counsel, he can renew it then.\" The judge suppressed the letters from the court record.\n\nOn May 25, 2011, Judge Burns ruled Loughner was then incompetent to stand trial, based on two medical evaluations. Court proceedings were suspended while Loughner, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, received psychiatric treatment at the psychiatric wing of the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. He was scheduled to appear in court on September 21, 2011, but that hearing was delayed until September 28, 2011, when the judge reviewed whether he could understand the charges against him and could assist in his own defense. (Loughner's lawyers unsuccessfully objected to him appearing at the hearing.)\n\nLoughner disrupted the court hearing with an outburst, and was carried from the court room. According to \"The New York Times\", Loughner believed he succeeded in killing Giffords, and clashed with his lawyer when she informed him that the congresswoman had survived.<ref name=\"NYT25/05/11\"></ref> He was judged still incompetent to stand trial following medical evaluations and a hearing in May 2011.\n\nOn June 26, 2011, Judge Burns ruled that prison doctors could forcibly medicate Loughner with antipsychotic drugs in order to treat him to restore him to competency for trial.\n\nBut, on July 12, 2011, a three-judge federal appeals panel from the Ninth Circuit ruled that Loughner could refuse anti-psychotic medication, since he \"has not been convicted of a crime, is presumptively innocent and is therefore entitled to greater constitutional protections than a convicted inmate.\" However, the ruling stated that it \"does not preclude prison authorities from taking other measures to maintain the safety of prison personnel, other inmates and Loughner himself, including forced administration of tranquilizers\".\n\nA week after the ruling, prison medical authorities resumed forcible treatment of Loughner with the antipsychotic risperidone, this time citing \"Washington v. Harper\" and stating the purpose of treatment was the need to control the danger he posed to himself and others in prison, rather than rendering him fit for trial. Loughner's defense team submitted an emergency motion to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, claiming that this treatment was in violation of their ruling and seeking an immediate injunction to halt treatment. The request for an injunction was denied by the court, allowing treatment to continue pending a full hearing into the matter. Arguments began on August 30 as to the lawfulness of this treatment. In March 2012, a federal appeals court denied a request by Loughner's lawyers to halt his forced medication.\n\nOn May 24, 2012 a federal judge ordered a competency hearing for June 27 (later postponed until August 7) to determine Loughner's mental fitness to stand trial. He remained at a federal prison hospital in Missouri pending the entry of his plea. A request by Loughner's lawyers to rehear arguments on forced medication was denied on June 5, 2012.\n\nOn August 7, 2012, Judge Burns found Loughner competent to stand trial based on medical evaluations. Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 counts at the hearing, which spared him the death penalty. The hearing began with Loughner listening calmly to testimony from Christina Pietz, Loughner's forensic psychologist, who testified that he had displayed depressive symptoms in 2006 and was formally diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2011. Pietz said that she believed that, after having been forcibly medicated for more than a year, Loughner had expressed remorse and was a changed individual. She said that he was competent to stand trial and agree to a plea. Sentencing was set for November 15, 2012 at 10 a.m. local time. The sentence could not include the death penalty, because the guilty plea bargain was made with an assurance that it would not be sought; Loughner under the law faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, U.S. Representative Ron Barber, a former aide to Mrs. Giffords who was shot in the attack, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, and the U.S. Attorney for Arizona, John S. Leonardo, had all approved the plea. It was offered and accepted after consultation with them and with the families of the other victims.\n\nBy pleading guilty in the deal, Loughner automatically waived his right to any further appeals and cannot later alter his plea to an insanity plea. Loughner must pay a restitution of $19 million, $1 million for each of the victims. He forfeited the weapons he used in the incident, and any money earned from efforts to sell his story. Loughner calmly answered that he understood each charge, and signed his initials after each page of the agreement and shakily signed his name to it, dated August 6.\n\nOn November 8, 2012, Loughner appeared in front of U.S. District Court Judge Larry Alan Burns in a court in Tucson. He was sentenced to serve seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years in prison without parole. Even though he was convicted and sentenced in federal court, there was still a possibility that Loughner could be tried for murder and other crimes in Arizona court. Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall declared later that afternoon that she would not prosecute Jared Loughner on behalf of the State of Arizona. LaWall explained that her decision would afford the victims and their families, as well as the community in Tucson and Pima County, an opportunity to move forward with their lives. She said that, after speaking and consulting personally with each of the surviving victims and with the family members of those killed, it was clear that they would not be benefitted by a State prosecution. Surviving victims and family members told LaWall that they are \"completely satisfied with the federal prosecution\", that \"justice has been served\", and that the federal sentence is \"suitably severe\".\n\nLoughner is currently serving his life sentence at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester, Minnesota, a prison for inmates with specialized health issues.\n\n"}

{"id": "19355156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19355156", "title": "Joe Schriner", "text": "Joe Schriner\n\nJoe Schriner (born March 3, 1955) is an American political activist and journalist. Schriner has run for the United States presidency in five consecutive election cycles spanning from 2000 to 2016. He has primarily run as an independent candidate, but he also ran as a Republican during the early portions of the 2010 and 2016 presidential election cycles. He also vied unsuccessfully for the Green Party presidential nomination during the 2008 election cycle.\n\nBefore becoming a perennial candidate, Schriner spent a significant amount of time travelling across the United States and conducting ad hoc interviews with individuals he met. Schriner purports that these subjective experiences leave him better-informed about national social, political, and economic issues than experienced policymakers. He has been interviewed by numerous media outlets over the years and has spoken at various colleges and universities.\n\nSchriner has been billed as \"average Joe\" in the media. He is also sometimes referred to as \"Joe the Painter.\" He is currently self-employed as a house painter. In addition, he is a free-lance writer for his hometown newspaper, \"The Bluffton News\".\n\nJoe Schriner was born on March 3, 1955, in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1973, he graduated from Bay Village High School, where he was the starting quarterback on the junior varsity football team.\n\nSchriner spent his freshman year at Bluffton College in Ohio. After taking a year off from school to work, he transferred to Bowling Green State University. He majored in journalism, wrote for the college newspaper, and completed an internship as a reporter on Ohio’s \"Troy Daily News\". Schriner earned a Bachelor of Arts in journalism from Bowling Green State University in 1978.\n\nSchriner began his career as a journalist after college for the \"Sandusky Register\". He was assigned as a bureau reporter to cover Huron, Ohio. He wrote about the town government and issues facing the local school division, in addition to various human interest features. Schriner left the \"Register\" after two years.\n\nSchriner then became a reporter for a new publication in Lorain, Ohio called \"The Metropolitan\". However, the publication was dissolved after eight months.\n\nIn 1983, Schriner began working at a halfway house in Lorain as a drug and alcoholism counselor. The halfway house was a 90-day treatment program run operated by the Lorain County Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (LCCADA). During the next two years, Schriner pursued seminar studies to become a certified drug and alcoholism counselor. After receiving this certification, he became an outpatient counselor (also with LCCADA), specializing in both individual and group counseling. Schriner eventually developed one of the first outpatient treatment models in the Midwest for \"adult children of alcoholics\". He later went into private practice in Cleveland, specializing in drug addiction, alcoholism, and addictive family system dynamics in the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1990, Schriner phased out his private counseling practice and took to the roads of America to begin extensive cross country research that would eventually lead to him running for president. He traveled some 100,000 miles from 1990 to 1998 interviewing people about a wide variety of issues. Information from these interviews would then be plugged into extensive position papers.\n\nDuring this time, he also became a \"lay Catholic speaker\" talking in numerous churches throughout the country about such topics as: abortion; euthanasia; the poor; environmental stewardship. (He believes in a Consistent Life Ethic and a good deal of his political platform revolves around the precepts of Catholic Social Teaching.)\n\nSchriner declared to run for U.S. President the first time with a speech at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, PA, on April 30, 1999. He initially declared as a Republican candidate, but then switched to independent after George W. Bush won the Republican Primaries. During that campaign, Schriner and his family were on the road 19 continuous months and traveled 20,000 campaign miles. The family did a number of what they referred to as Americana Tour Routes: Old Route 66; the Old National Pike; the Lewis & Clark Trail, to name a few. For this campaign, they also did a 2,000-mile Back-to-Basics Tour through the Midwest on bicycles. His travels for this campaign are chronicled in the book: \"Back Road to the White House\".\n\nSchriner ran again in 2004, with him and his family logging some 40,000 campaign miles. They, again, did tours with Americana themes: the Country Music Highway; the \"Black Belt Region\" Tour; a \"Coast-to-Coast\" Tour. In addition, the Schriners campaigned heavily in Ohio this election, including a 1,300-mile Buckeye Trail Tour. A hallmark of the campaign is doing regular, and impromptu, \"back road stumping\" on small town street corners, in diners and in village parks. In addition, during this time he talked at the University of Dayton, the University of Toledo, and Greenville College.\n\nDuring these two campaigns, the Schriner family accumulatively traveled some 50,000 miles. Besides the small town stumping, during this time Schriner also talked at Holy Cross College, the University of Notre Dame, LaGrange College. The family also did an extended \"Immigration Border Tour\" looking at Hispanic Immigration issues, as they traveled the San Joaquin Valley looking at farm worker issues. During part of these campaigns, the Schriners also moved to a hardscrabble area of Cleveland, Ohio (just west of the inner city) to do outreach work with the Catholic Workers there. In between campaign tours, the Schriners lived in Cleveland for five years. Schriner wrote the book \"America’s Best Urban Neighborhood\" about the family’s experiences in Cleveland. After the Cleveland experience, the Schriners moved back to Bluffton in 2011. Schriner has also written two books about Bluffton: \"America’s Best Town\" and \"America’s Best Town 2\". He writes that Bluffton has the \"best quality of life\" when it comes to such things as town camaraderie, civic activism, outreach to the poor, environmental stewardship, and downtown vibrancy. These are all qualities that he emphasizes in his political platform.\n\nIn keeping with the grassroots nature of Schriner’s campaign, he initially put up a campaign flier on a general store bulletin board in Beaverdam, Ohio, in October 2014. Schriner subsequently declared his candidacy in a podcast on the home page of his official campaign website. This marks his fifth consecutive run for president.\n\nSchriner, a journalist, has traveled the country extensively, interviewing a wide variety of people for a comprehensive series of lengthy position papers on many topics of the day. The lynchpin of his campaign revolves around a \"Consistent Life Ethic\" that sets him against abortion, euthanasia, poverty, global warming, nuclear proliferation, violence on the streets and anything else that can end life prematurely. Schriner was one of the featured speakers at the Consistent Life 25th Anniversary Conference in Chevy Chase, Maryland (March 9–11, 2012). Schriner has also repeatedly said that he and his wife Liz are running as \"concerned parents\" from the Midwest.\n\nShortly before the 2016 election Schriner and his family moved to Steubenville, Ohio.\n\nSchriner resides in Steubenville, Ohio. He and his wife Liz have three children. Schriner met his wife, a native of New Zealand, on the road in Homer, Alaska.\n\n\n\n"}

In Portugal, he became a virtuoso violinist in the Lisbon Opera. He was press-ganged by British Admiral Sir Edward Pellew during the Napoleonic wars and spent the next four years as a ship's fiddler.\n\nIn 1799, Emidy was abandoned in Falmouth, Cornwall, United Kingdom. In Falmouth, he earned his living as a violinist and a teacher. He became the leader of the Truro Philharmonic Orchestra, and went on to become one of the most celebrated and influential musical figures in early 19th-century Cornwall. He composed many works, including concertos and a symphony, but no known copies survive.\n\nIn 1802, he married Jane Hutchins, a local tradesman’s daughter, and they had eight children.

{"id": "657884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657884", "title": "Khalid Abdul Muhammad", "text": "Khalid Abdul Muhammad\n\nKhalid Abdul Muhammad (born Harold Moore Jr.; January 12, 1948 – February 17, 2001) was an American black nationalist who came to prominence as a leader in the Nation of Islam and then the New Black Panther Party. After a racially inflammatory 1993 speech at Kean College, Muhammad was condemned and removed from his position in the Nation of Islam by Louis Farrakhan. He was also censured by both Houses of the United States Congress.\n\nAfter being removed from the Nation of Islam he served as the National Chairman of the New Black Panther Party until his death in 2001 from a brain aneurysm. Despite the controversy that followed him, his strong and unapologetic denunciations of white supremacy gained him the support of some in the black community.\n\nHarold Moore Jr. was raised by his aunt, Carrie Moore Vann, in Houston, Texas, where he attended Bruce Elementary School, E.O. Smith Junior High School, and all-black Phyllis Wheatley High School. After graduating high school, Moore went to Dillard University in Louisiana, where he was known as Harold Vann, to pursue a degree in theological studies, but he did not graduate. At this time, he ministered at Sloan Memorial Methodist Church. In 1967, he was initiated into Omega Psi Phi fraternity (Theta Sigma chapter). Later, Moore transferred to Pepperdine University and earned his bachelor's degree.\n\nIn 1970, while attending Dillard, Moore joined the Nation of Islam, which was then under the leadership of Elijah Muhammad. He changed his name to Harold Smith or Harold X, then to Malik Rushaddin, became Minister Louis Farrakhan's protégé, and was active as a recruiter within the organization. In 1978, Rushaddin was appointed Western Regional Minister of the Nation of Islam and leader of Mosque #27. In 1983, Minister Farrakhan named him Khalid after the Islamic general Khalid ibn al-Walid, a follower of the prophet Muhammad, calling him the Sword of Allah.\n\nBy 1984, Muhammad had become one of Louis Farrakhan's most trusted advisors in the Nation of Islam. He traveled to Libya on a fund-raising trip, where he became well acquainted with that country's leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi. Muhammad's dedication to Farrakhan and to the message of the NOI eventually secured him the title of national spokesman and he was named one of Louis Farrakhan's friends in 1981. He served at Nation of Islam mosques in New York and Atlanta throughout the 1980s. A federal court convicted him in 1987 of mortgage fraud and sentenced him to nine months in prison. After his prison term he returned to the Nation, becoming Farrakhan's national advisor in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Muhammad gave a speech at Kean College in Union Township, New Jersey, in which Muhammad referred to Jews as \"bloodsuckers\", labeled the Pope a \"no-good cracker\", and advocated the murder of any and all white South Africans who would not leave the nation subsequent to a warning period of 24 hours. He used the Book of John in the Bible to defend his statements against \"so-called White Jews\", saying that they crucified Jesus because he revealed them to be liars, and against \"their father, the Devil\". The United States Senate voted 97–0 to censure Muhammad, and the United States House of Representatives in a special session passed a House Resolution. Farrakhan responded by publicly condemning Muhammad's speech.\n\nMuhammad was silenced as a minister and left the NOI soon afterward. In 1994, Muhammad appeared on \"The Phil Donahue Show\". He participated in heated arguments with Jewish audience members amid an explanation of his public statements.\n\nMuhammad was shot by James Bess, a former NOI member, after he spoke at the University of California, Riverside on May 29, 1994. He survived the shooting. Many believed the shooting was a part of a conspiracy against Muhammad.\n\nAfter being stripped of his position as NOI spokesman, Muhammad became the national chairman of the New Black Panther Party. On May 21, 1997, he delivered a heated speech at San Francisco State University in which he criticized Jews, whites, Catholics and homosexuals.\n\nIn 1998, Muhammad organized the \"Million Youth March\" in New York City which attracted an estimated 6,000 participants. The march was controversial from its inception as New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani denied the organizers a permit, calling it a hate march. A court ruled that the event could go on but scaled back its duration and size. At the conclusion of the rally, just as Muhammad appeared on the stage to speak, the demonstration was interrupted by a low-flying police helicopter. Muhammad alleges that was the signal for more than 3,000 police in riot gear, including some mounted on horseback, to come in and disperse the crowd. In response, Muhammad exhorted the rally participants to attack the oncoming police, to beat them with rails, and to shoot them with their own guns. Dozens were arrested, and 30 officers and five civilians were injured. Mayor Giuliani said that the march turned out to be precisely what he predicted, \"filled with hatred, horrible, awful, vicious, anti-Semitic and other anti-white rhetoric, as well as exhortations to kill people, murder people ... the speeches given today should not occur [at] any place.\" In subsequent activism, Muhammad convened a second march in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Muhammad's beliefs were introduced to a completely new demographic when it was revealed that one of the contestants on the American version of the Dutch television show \"Big Brother\", William Collins (Hiram Ashantee), was a follower of his. He also appeared in an episode of \"Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends\".\n\nIn 2001, Muhammad died suddenly of a brain aneurysm in Atlanta, Georgia, at the age of 53. He was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Westchester County, New York, near the grave of Malcolm X.\n\nAs a prominent Afrocentrist and speaker on African history, Muhammad attracted interest from several hip-hop artists, who sampled him in their songs. Public Enemy quoted him in the introduction of its 1988 track \"Night of the Living Baseheads,\" from the album \"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\":\n\nHave you forgotten that once we were brought here, we were robbed of our name, robbed of our language. We lost our religion, our culture, our god ... and many of us, by the way we act, we even lost our minds.\nRage Against the Machine later paraphrased this quote in the lyrics of \"Freedom\" (\"Rage Against the Machine\", 1992) with the line, \"Brotha, did you forget your name?\"\n\nHe also appeared on Ice Cube's albums \"Death Certificate\" (1991) and \"Lethal Injection\" (1993) as a guest rapper. On the former album, Muhammad appeared in the tracks \"Death\" and \"The Birth\". On the latter, he appeared in the song \"Cave Bitch,\" a song ridiculing white women. On MC Ren's 1996 album \"The Villain in Black\" Muhammad appeared in the track \"Muhammad Speaks,\" where he spoke about the history of the rights of African-Americans.\n\nMusical references to Muhammad since his death include a quote of his \"Kill the White Man\" speech on The Used's 2009 album \"Artwork\", a sample of his interview with Louis Theroux in the Chase & Status song \"Hocus Pocus\", and excerpts from a recording of one of his speeches concerning Jesus in the D'Angelo song \"1000 Deaths\" on the 2014 album \"Black Messiah\".\n\nMuhammad had five children, including Farrah Gray, who grew up in Chicago's South Side without their father present. Although Gray saw his father only during occasional visits, he credits Muhammad for inspiring him with confidence. Gray rose from poverty to become a successful business entrepreneur, but did not join his father's political activities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30727318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30727318", "title": "Legacy of Leonid Brezhnev", "text": "Legacy of Leonid Brezhnev\n\nThe full understanding of the history of the late Soviet Union and of its successor, the Russian Federation, requires the assessment of the legacy of Leonid Brezhnev, the third General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and twice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Leonid Brezhnev was the leader of the CPSU from 1964 until his death in 1982, whose eighteen-year reign was recognised as the time of social and economic stagnation in the late Soviet Union.\n\nDespite his failures in domestic reforms, his foreign affairs and defence policies consolidated the position of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) as a superpower. His popularity among the citizenry waned during his last years, and the Soviet people's belief in communism and Marxism–Leninism slowly withered away but support still continued to be evident, even on the eve of his death. Following his death, political wrangling led to harsh criticism of both him and his family. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, drew support from communists and the Soviet population by criticising Brezhnev's rule, and referred to his rule as the \"Era of Stagnation\".\n\nAside from the socio-economic stagnation Brezhnev left to the nation, there was also a heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.\n\nWhen Leonid Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 Yuri Andropov was elected chairman of the committee in charge of managing his funeral. According to \"Time\" magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviet citizens. First World commentators saw this as proof that Andropov would become Brezhnev's successor as general secretary. The political corruption which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure had become a major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that the Soviet economy would possibly recover if the Soviet Government was able to increase social discipline amongst workers. Brezhnev's regime was also criticised for ideological laxness and self-indulgence. The gerontocracy established by Brezhnev was slowly phased out by Andropov, and new recruits were appointed to the Party \"centre\", such as future Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Chief Ideologue Yegor Ligachev. Soviet foreign policy had also gone awry during Brezhnev's last years, and by June 1982, just before his death, Ronald Reagan classified the Soviet Union as an \"Evil Empire\". This hardline diplomatic stance did not wither away before Mikhail Gorbachev initiated the \"New Thinking\". Support for Marxism–Leninism continued to be evident amongst the Soviet people, however, its base of support slowly withered during the Brezhnev Era. The Soviet people still remained wary of such concepts as liberal democracy and multi-party systems, and because of it, Marxism–Leninism remained the leading belief in the country. Due to the large military buildup of the 1960s the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower during Brezhnev's rule.\n\nBrezhnev's family, Yuri, Galina and Yuri Churbanov, were investigated and all, with the exception of Galina, were arrested on charges of political corruption during Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law, was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption. By December 1988 Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, along with the rest of Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges. The city of Brezhnev reverted to its old name Naberezhnye Chelny, and a group within the Soviet leadership wanted to rename all towns, street, factories and institutions bearing Brezhnev's name. This was actually carried through by the authorities in December 1988 when the Soviet Government issued a decree which stated all town, streets, factories, institutions and the like bearing Brezhnev's and Konstantin Chernenko's were to revert to their former name. According to his grandson Andrei Brezhnev, the very name Brezhnev had become a curse for the family, and several family members had been forced out of their jobs and their friends had deserted them. Brezhnev, who had inflated his role in World War II, was rescinded the Order of Victory on 21 September 1989 in a Supreme Soviet convocation.\n\nDuring the Gorbachev Era, Brezhnev's rule was considered less successful than that of Joseph Stalin; in an opinion measurement poll only 7 percent chose the Brezhnev Era as good, while 10 percent picked the Stalin Era as good. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Boris Yeltsin's subsequent market reforms, many Russians viewed the Brezhnev era with nostalgia; they missed the stability of that era which had subsequently been lost during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras.\n\nHistorians have expressed criticism for Brezhnev and his rule. The scholarly literature dealing with him is scarce and, with the exception of the period immediately after his death, overwhelmingly negative. Very little has been written about Brezhnev in English, and even Russian. According to Mark Sandle and Edwin Bacon, the authors behind \"Brezhnev Reconsidered\", Brezhnev attracted little attention from the media due to a consensus that came shortly after his death, namely that his rule was primarily one of stagnation. When Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, initiated \"perestroika\" he blamed the degradation of the Soviet economic and political system on Brezhnev, and called his rule the \"Era of Stagnation\". Gorbachev claimed that Brezhnev followed \"a fierce neo-Stalinist line\", although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out to be, saying, \"Brezhnev was nothing like the cartoon figure that is made of him now\".\n\nBritish historian Robert Service wrote in his book, \"Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-First Century\", that \"When he [Brezhnev] succeeded Khrushchev, he was still a vigorous politician who expected to make the Party and government work more effectively. He had not been inactive; he had not been entirely inflexible. But his General Secretaryship had turned into a ceremonial reign that had brought communism into its deepest contempt since 1917.\" He added that it was \"hard to feel very sorry for Brezhnev\"; his socio-economic policies had sent the country into an Era of Stagnation from which his successors were never able to fully recover. Talal Nizameddin states in his book \"Russia and the Middle East: Towards A New Foreign Policy\" that \"Brezhnev's legacy, generally unaffected by his weak successors (Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko), was entanglement in Afghanistan, tension with China and Japan, as well as the prospect of a new dimension to the arms race with the United States in the form of the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars).\" According to historian David Dyker in his book \"The Soviet Union under Gorbachev: Prospects for Reform\" \"Brezhnev left his successors a Soviet Union suffering from a host of domestic and foreign problems\". The biggest obstacle, according to Dyker, was the weakness of the economy which had undermined Soviet influence outside its borders considerably during the late Brezhnev due to its relative technological backwardness.\n\nThe author of \"The Soviet Paradox: External Expansion, Internal Decline\" Seweryn Bialer has a more mixed assessment of Brezhnev's reign. Bialer notes that the era was a time of \"lost opportunities\", but admits that the economic growth during Brezhnev's first years weakened \"the rationale for radical reform\". However, as Bialer notes in his book, even the gerontocracy which Brezhnev himself had created were disillusioned with Brezhnev's leadership when he died in 1982. In his book \"Russia's Transformation: Snapshots of a Crumbling System\" Robert Vincent Daniels argues that Brezhnev \"gave the country stability, if nothing else, even though it was the stability of the police state\", and that his domestic and external policies tried to ensure the \"status quo\". Daniels believes that Brezhnev's reign can be separated into two parts, the first, starting in 1964 and ending in 1975 conforms to a \"status quo leadership, building the economy, pursuing détente, and maintaining political equilibrium at home\". The second phase, which began in 1975, was exactly the opposite; the economy stopped growing, the collective leadership ended with Nikolai Podgorny's removal, Brezhnev developed a cult of personality and the Soviet Union itself started to stagnate. Historians Jiří Valenta and Frank Cibulka noted in their book \"Gorbachev's New Thinking and Third World Conflicts\" that Brezhnev's legacy was a \"mixture of achievements and failures in both domestic and foreign policy\". However, they argue that by the time of his death his failures had become severe chronic systematic problems. Brezhnev's main achievements, according to Valenta and Cibulka, was his foreign and defense policies, however, with the economy in decline these achievements were not durable in the long-run. They also note that the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower, which in turn increased their influence in non-communist Third World countries.\n\nOn a positive note, Ian Thatcher argues that \"[r]ather than deserving a reputation as the most vilified of all Soviet leaders, Brezhnev should be praised as one of the most successful exponents of the art of Soviet politics.\" He argues that Brezhnev was a good politician within the framework of the Soviet political system. Dmitry Peskov said \"Brezhnev wasn’t a minus for the history of our country, he was a huge plus, he laid a foundation for the country’s economics and agriculture.\" Archie Brown wrote in his book, \"The Rise & Fall of Communism\", that \"From the point of view of Communist rulers, the Brezhnev era was in many ways successful.\" Brown adds that the Soviet Union reached \"rough parity with the United States\" militarily by the early 1970s, and became a superpower in the military sense of the world. According to Brown \"The Brezhnev era was a time when tens of millions of Soviet citizens lived a peaceful and predictable life than hitherto\" and where \"Most people did not live in fear of the KGB.\"\n\nBrezhnev has fared well in Russian opinion polls when compared to his successors and predecessors. However, in the West he is most commonly remembered for starting the economic stagnation which triggered the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A 2000 poll by VTsIOM asked various Russians the question \"Was a given period more positive or more negative for the country?\". 36 percent of the people polled viewed Brezhnev's tenure as more positive than negative. His predecessor, Nikita Khrushchev trailed close behind him, earning 33 percent. A poll by the Public Opinion Fund (VTsIOM) in September 1999 similarly chose the Brezhnev period as the time in the 20th century when \"ordinary people lived best\", having a clear majority of 51 to 10. In a similar poll done in 1994, Brezhnev garnered a majority of only 36 to 16. According to a 2006 Public Opinion Fund poll, 61 percent of the Russian people viewed the Brezhnev era as good for the country. A poll by the VTsIOM in 2007 showed that the majority of Russians would choose to live during the Brezhnev era over any other period of 20th-century Russian history. Researchers have noted a surge in Brezhnev's popularity, along with other communist rulers, during and in the aftermath of the Russian financial crisis of 1998, which is well remembered by many Russians for plunging many into poverty. When comparing these two periods, Brezhnev's USSR is best remembered for stability in prices and income by the Russians and not the socio-economic stagnation for which he is remembered in the West.\n"}

At the time of his death, he was the longest-surviving HIV-positive born child.\n\nNkosi was born to Nonthlanthla Daphne Nkosi in a village near Dannhauser in 1989. He never knew his father.

With an audience of approximately 50,000 listeners weekly, Moweta is the only African-born radio host in Los Angeles, California. In 2011, Moweta was featured on Reuters Africa Journal segment about African DJs in the United States.\n\nMoweta is recognized by UCLA's ethnomusicology program as an expert in the field of African and African-influenced music—he has served as a panelist for UCLA's annual ethnomusicology conferences which attempt to educate the public about global arts and cultures.\n\nOriginally from Jos Plateau State Nigeria, Moweta grew up in Jos, Minna, Kano and Lagos. He speaks Igbo and Yoruba fluently and is Igbo. In 1978, Moweta came to the US to study film-making at the San Francisco Art Institute. He moved to Los Angeles in 1982 and established himself as a DJ, music supervisor, consultant, manager, and event promoter. In 1983, Moweta received a grant from the Department of Cultural Affairs in Los Angeles to host an eight-week segment about the origins of rap music. The program aired on KPFK that year and afterwards, Moweta was asked by KPFK to host a weekly show and subsequently, Radio Afrodicia began broadcasting on June 21, 1995.\n\nMoweta currently hosts Radio Afrodicia, which features both internationally-known and new musicians.

The show not only highlights musicians performing in all regions of Africa, but also features African musicians performing in other areas of the world and non-African musicians who draw upon African traditions for their musical inspiration.\n\nFor several years, Moweta has promoted and supported local events in Los Angeles that educate the public about African culture and music. One of his largest and longest-running events was the African Village Festival held at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. From 1997-2003, Moweta produced the annual African Village Festival, which showcased music from all over Africa, Brazil, and Cuba.\nIn 1995, Moweta managed Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe, the Nigerian performer who rose to international fame as the leading contributor of African popular music, known as highlife.

He served as the inspiration for Buck Mulligan in James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\".\n\nGogarty was born 17 August 1878 in Rutland Square, Dublin, the eldest child of Henry Gogarty, a well-to-do Dublin physician, and Margaret Gogarty (née Oliver), the daughter of a Galway mill owner. Three siblings (Henry, Mary, and Richard) were born later. Gogarty's father, himself the son of a medical doctor, had been educated at Trinity College and owned two fashionable homes in Dublin, which set the Gogartys apart from other Irish Catholic families at that time and allowed them access to the same social circles as the Protestant Ascendancy.\n\nIn 1887 Gogarty's father died of a burst appendix, and Gogarty was sent to Mungret College, a boarding school near Limerick. He was unhappy in his new school, and the following year he transferred to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England, which he liked little better, later referring to it as \"a religious jail\".\n\nGogarty returned to Ireland in 1896 and boarded at Clongowes Wood College while studying for examinations with the Royal University of Ireland. He was a talented athlete; in England he had briefly played for the Preston North End FC Reserve, and while at Clongowes he played for the Bohemian FC. He also played on Clongowes's soccer and cricket elevens. His extracurricular interests, which also included cycling and drinking, prevented him from being an attentive student, and in 1898 he switched to the medical school at Trinity College, having failed eight of his ten examinations at the Royal.\n\nAs one of Dublin's \"medicos\", Gogarty was known to be fond of public pranks and midnight carousing in \"the Kips\", Dublin's red-light district. He had a talent for humorous and bawdy verse, which quickly made the rounds through the city, and sometimes composed mnemonic lyrics to aid his medical studies. He also enjoyed a highly successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901 for bad language, and between 1898 and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drowning. He became interested in Irish nationalism after meeting Arthur Griffith in 1899, and contributed propaganda pieces to \"The United Irishman\" over subsequent years.\n\nA serious interest in poetry and literature also began to manifest itself during his years at Trinity. His witty conversation made him a favourite with the dons, particularly John Pentland Mahaffy (formerly the tutor of Oscar Wilde) and Robert Yelverton Tyrrell, and between 1901 and 1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor's prizes for verse. In 1900 he made the acquaintance of W. B. Yeats (of whom his mother highly approved) and of George Moore (of whom she did not) and began to frequent Dublin literary circles. He also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as Seamus O'Sullivan and James Joyce. In 1904 he spent two terms at Oxford to compete for the Newdigate Prize, but lost to G.K.A. Bell, the future Bishop of Chichester, who became a friend and frequent correspondent over the next few years.\n\nUpon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the famous Martello Tower in Sandycove. The primary goal of this scheme, as described by Gogarty in a letter to G.K.A. Bell, was to \"house the Bard\" (i.e. James Joyce), who was without money and required \"a year in which to finish his novel.\" The two friends quarrelled in August, however, and Joyce either failed to move in or left shortly after doing so. Joyce briefly took up residence in the Tower the following month, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a setup which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of \"Ulysses)\" but left again suddenly after only six days. Forty years later in America, Gogarty would attribute Joyce's abrupt departure to his and S.C. Trench's midnight antics with a loaded revolver. Joyce and Gogarty corresponded intermittently during the early years of Joyce's continental exile and occasionally planned meetings, but contemporaneous letters from Joyce to his brother reveal deep distrust of Gogarty's motives, and their friendship was never fully renewed. Gogarty made use of the Martello Tower during the following year as a writing retreat and party venue, and officially held the lease until 1925.\n\nIn 1904 and 1905 Gogarty published several short poems in the London publication \"The Venture\" and in John Eglinton's journal \"Dana\". His name also appeared in print as the renegade priest Fr. Oliver Gogarty in George Moore's 1905 novel \"The Lake\", an occurrence which upset Gogarty's devout mother. In 1905 Gogarty became one of the founding members of Arthur Griffith's Sinn Féin, a non-violent political movement with a plan for Irish autonomy modelled after the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy.\n\nIn August 1906, Gogarty married Martha Duane, a girl from a landowning Connemara family. Eager to establish himself with a profession, he passed his final medical examinations in June 1907, several months after the death of his mother. In July 1907 his first son, Oliver Duane Odysseus Gogarty (known as \"Noll\") was born, and in autumn of that year Gogarty left for Vienna to finish the practical phase of his medical training. Owing in part to the influence of his mentor, Sir Robert Woods, Gogarty had decided to specialise in otolaryngology, and in Vienna he studied under Ottokar Chiari, Markus Hajek, and Robert Bárány.\n\nReturning to Dublin in 1908, Gogarty secured a post at Richmond Hospital, and shortly afterwards purchased a house in Ely Place opposite George Moore. Three years later, he joined the staff of the Meath Hospital and remained there for the remainder of his medical career. He became known for flamboyant theatrics in the operating room, including off-the-cuff witticisms and the flinging of recently removed larynxes at the viewing gallery. He also maintained ENT consulting rooms in Ely Place, attracting a number of wealthy clients and attending to less well-off patients for free.\n\nGogarty and his wife went on to have two more children, Dermot (born 1908) and Brenda (born 1911), and in 1917 Gogarty purchased Renyvle House, a large country house in Renvyle, Connemara. He became a keen motorist during this time, purchasing a succession of cars that culminated with a buttercup-coloured Rolls Royce. During the following decade he was also interested in aviation, earning a pilot's licence and helping to found the Irish Aero Club.\n\nAs a Sinn Féiner during the Irish War of Independence, Gogarty participated in a variety of anti-Black and Tan schemes, allowing his home to be used as a safe house and transporting disguised IRA volunteers in his car. Following the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Gogarty sided with the pro-Treaty government (headed by his close friend Arthur Griffith) and was made a Free State Senator. When Griffith fell ill during the summer of 1922, Gogarty frequently attended his bedside. His death on 12 August 1922 had a profound effect on Gogarty; W.T. Cosgrave later observed that \"he was almost mortally wounded when Griffith died, he was so very, very much attached to him.\" Gogarty carried out Griffith's official autopsy and embalmment, and went on to perform the same offices for Michael Collins, another close friend whom Gogarty had often sheltered in his Ely Place home prior to his assassination. It was rumoured that Griffith had been planning to make Gogarty the new Governor-General of the Irish Free State, but in his absence the post went to Tim Healy.\n\nIn November 1922, anti-Treaty IRA commander Liam Lynch issued a general order to his forces to shoot Free State Senators. Two months later, Gogarty was kidnapped by a group of anti-Treaty militants, who lured him out of his house and into a waiting car under the pretext of bringing him to visit a sick patient. Gogarty was subsequently driven to an empty house near Chapelizod and held under armed guard. Aware that he might be in imminent danger of execution, Gogarty contrived to have himself led out into the garden (purportedly by claiming to be suffering from diarrhoea), where he broke free from his captors and flung himself into the Liffey; he then swam to shore and delivered himself to the protection of the police barracks in Phoenix Park. In February of that same year, Renvyle was burnt to the ground by anti-Treaty forces. Following these incidents, Gogarty relocated his family and practice to London, where he resided until February 1924. Upon returning to Ireland, he famously released two swans into the River Liffey in gratitude for his life.\n\nGogarty remained a senator until the abolition of the Seanad in 1936, during which time he identified with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims. He believed that Ireland should retain its dominion status in the British Commonwealth so as to \"keep with nations who understand that the first principle of freedom is a freedom that does not permit interference with the personal liberties of the citizen.\" He supported rural electrification schemes, road improvement, reforestation and conservation, prevention of livestock cruelty, and educational reform. His views on controversial issues such as censorship and birth control were ambiguous; after expressing initial support for the Censorship Bill, he eventually went on to denounce it in scathing terms (\"I think it is high time the men of this country found some other way of loving God than by hating women\"), and while generally professing to oppose the sale of prophylactics, he voiced support for their usage in certain cases. He was most passionate on the subject of sanitation in schools and in urban and rural housing, about which he spoke frequently. His speeches frequently contained puns, wordplays, and extended poetic quotations, and were sometimes given in favour of facetious schemes, such as his attempt to have the phoenix statue in Phoenix Park included in the 1929 Wild Birds Protection Bill. He was notoriously scornful of the government's attempts to reinstate the Irish language (which he referred to as \"Woolworth's Irish\"), proposing that funding be used instead for housing and school health services, and remained perpetually suspicious of Éamon de Valera, against whose economic policies, character, and personal appearance he often hurled invectives during Seanad proceedings. De Valera eventually dissolved the Seanad when it persisted in obstructing Government proposals, effectively ending Gogarty's political career.\n\nGogarty maintained close friendships with W. B. Yeats, AE, George Moore, Lord Dunsany, James Stephens, Seamus O'Sullivan, and other Dublin literati, and continued to write poetry in the midst of his political and professional duties. Three small books of poetry (\"Hyperthuleana\", \"Secret Springs of Dublin Song\", and \"The Ship and Other Poems\") were published between 1916 and 1918. Gogarty also tried his hand at playwriting, producing a slum drama (\"Blight\") in 1917 under the pseudonym \"Alpha and Omega\", and two comedies (\"A Serious Thing\" and \"The Enchanted Trousers\") in 1919 under the pseudonym \"Gideon Ouseley\", all three of which were performed at the Abbey Theatre.\n\nGogarty devoted less energy to his medical practice and more to his writing during the twenties and thirties. His 1924 book of poetry \"An Offering of Swans\" won the Gold Medal for poetry at the revived Tailteann Games, for which he also wrote the 1924 Olympic bronze medal-winning \"Tailteann Ode\" (which he was later to describe as \"rather tripe\"). In 1929 another book of verse, \"Wild Apples\", was published, and was followed in 1933 by \"Selected Poems\". Gogarty was also a member of Yeats's Irish Academy of Letters and frequently assisted in arranging its social functions. 1936 saw the publication of Yeats's \"Oxford Book of Modern Verse\", which contained seventeen of Gogarty's poems and an introduction proclaiming him \"one of the great lyric poets of our age.\" The over-representation given to Gogarty outraged many poets and perplexed Gogarty himself, who remarked, \"What right have I to figure so bulkily? None from a poetical point of view... Sappho herself could not have made a more subjective anthology.\"\n\nIn 1935 Gogarty published his first prose work, \"As I Was Going Down Sackville Street\" (subtitled \"A Phantasy in Fact\"), a semi-fictional novel-memoir that tells, in reverse chronological order, the story of Gogarty's Dublin through a series of interconnected anecdotes and lively characters sketches. Shortly after its publication, it became the subject of a lawsuit by a Jewish art dealer, Harry Sinclair, who claimed that he and his recently deceased twin brother, William Sinclair, had been libeled by the publication. The two men did not appear as named characters in the book, but some derogatory lines of verse beginning \"Two Jews grew in Sackville Street\", written by Gogarty's friend George Redding and included in a scene in the novel, were widely known to refer to the Sinclair siblings. Harry Sinclair further recognised a reference to his grandfather, described in the text as one who \"enticed little girls into his office\", an offence of which his grandfather had in fact been convicted. Gogarty responded to the charges by claiming that the unnamed Jews were parodies or composite characters rather than deliberate evocations of living persons. The case attracted a great deal of public attention, with one commentator observing that \"only \"The Pickwick Papers\", rewritten by James Joyce, could really capture the mood of this trial.\" Among the witnesses for the prosecution was William Sinclair's nephew-by-marriage, Samuel Beckett, then a little-known writer, who was humiliatingly denounced as a \"bawd and blasphemer\" by Gogarty's counsel. Gogarty ultimately lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay £900 in damages, plus court costs. This outcome deeply embittered Gogarty, who had already suffered financial setbacks after the stock market crash of 1929 and felt that the verdict had been politically motivated.\n\nIn spite of the \"Sackville Street\" imbroglio, Gogarty's output over the next two years was prolific. In 1938 he published \"I Follow St. Patrick\", a historical and geographic portrait of Ireland as told through Gogarty's rambling visits to various sites traditionally associated with St. Patrick; in 1939 he published \"Tumbling in the Hay\", a semi-autobiographical comic novel about medical students in turn-of-the-century Dublin, and \"Elbow Room\", another collection of poetry. In 1938 he relocated to London for a second time and brought forth his own libel suit against the young poet Patrick Kavanagh, whose autobiography \"The Green Fool\" said of Kavanagh's first visit to Gogarty's home: \"I mistook Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife.\" Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words \"wife\" and \"mistress\", was awarded £100 in damages.\n\nWith the onset of World War II, Gogarty, who was an enthusiastic and talented amateur aviator, attempted to enlist in the RAF and the RAMC as a doctor. He was denied on grounds of age. He then departed in September 1939 for an extended lecture tour in the United States, leaving his wife to manage Renvyle House, which had since been rebuilt as a hotel. When his return to Ireland was delayed by the war, Gogarty applied for American citizenship, and eventually decided to reside permanently in the United States. Though he regularly sent letters, funds, and care-packages to his family and returned home for occasional holiday visits, he never again lived in Ireland for any extended length of time. His primary American residence was in New York, where he was known to frequent bars on Third Avenue. He also spent time in Vermont and in Wyckoff, New Jersey.\n\nFeeling that he was too old to sit for the medical examinations that would have qualified him as a practitioner in the United States, Gogarty instead chose to support himself entirely by his writing. In addition to various essays and short stories, his prose output included \"Going Native\", a satire on English social mores, \"Mad Grandeur\" and \"Mr. Petunia\", two period narratives composed with an eye to having them optioned as Hollywood films, and \"Rolling Down the Lea\" and \"It Isn't This Time of Year at All!\", two loosely constructed memoirs. He also published two books of poems, \"Perennial\" and \"Unselected Poems\"; a collection of bawdy verse, \"The Merry Muses of Hibernia\", was planned but never completed. Gogarty's literary output during the forties and fifties is generally considered to be inferior to his earlier writings.\n\nGogarty suffered from heart complaints during the last few years of his life, and in September 1957 he collapsed in the street on his way to dinner. He died on 22 September 1957; his body was flown home to Ireland and buried in Cartron Church, Moyard, near Renvyle.\n\nA highly visible and distinctive Dublin character during his lifetime, Gogarty appears in a number of memoirs penned by his contemporaries, notably George Moore's \"Hail and Farewell\", where he goes both by his own name and by the pseudonym \"Conan.\" His most famous literary incarnation, however, is as Buck Mulligan, the irrepressible roommate of Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's \"Ulysses\". Mulligan quotes a number of songs and poems known to have been written by Gogarty, the most famous of which, \"The Song of the Cheerful (But Slightly Sarcastic) Jesus\", was originally sent to Joyce as a belated Christmas peace offering after their quarrels of 1904. Other details, such as Mulligan's Hellenism, his status as a medical student, his history of saving men from drowning, his friendship with George Moore, and the metrical arrangement of his full name (Malachi Roland St. John Mulligan) parallel Gogarty's biography. Due to his influence on Joyce (he is also sometimes cited as an inspiration for \"Dubliners\" character Ignatius Gallaher and \"Exiles\" antagonist Robert Hand), Gogarty's name often comes up in Joyce scholarship, though Gogarty's own editors and biographers have complained that these references are frequently inaccurate, owing to Gogarty-related errata in Richard Ellmann's \"James Joyce\" and a tendency to conflate the real-life Gogarty with the fictional character of Buck Mulligan.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the speaker of W. B. Yeats's poem \"High Talk\", \"Malachi Stilt-Jack\", is intended to be a representation of Gogarty.\n\nA pub in the Temple Bar district of Dublin is named after him, and an annual Oliver St. John Gogarty Literary Festival is held in the author's family home, now the Renvyle House Hotel in Connemara. A surgical ward in the descendant hospital of his workplace, the AMNCH, now also bears his name.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nCanseco was born and reared in Laredo in Webb County in south Texas, the eldest of eight children of Consuelo Sada Rangel and Dr. Francisco Manuel Canseco, who were both born in Monterrey, Mexico. He earned a B.A in History from Saint Louis University in 1972. He went on to earn a J.D. from Saint Louis University School of Law in 1975. He is a brother in the Tau Kappa Epsilon International Fraternity. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Sephardic Jewish descent.\n\nCanseco began his legal career in 1975 as an associate attorney with Mann, Castillon, Fried and Kazen in Laredo. Afterwards, he operated his own practice for five years. Then he joined Person, Whitworth, Ramos, Borchers, and Morales in Laredo as a participating associate. In 1987, he left that firm to become general counsel at Union National Bank of Texas, where he stayed until 1992. He was later counsel to Escamilla and Ponek, from 2003 until 2007. He became chairman of Texas Heritage Bancshares from 2001 until 2007.\n\nSince 1988, Canseco has been President/Director of FMC Developers, which includes Canseco Investments (incorporated in 1993). He, along with Chairman James William Danner, Sr., took Hondo National Bank from being a failing bank with $8 Million in assets and one location, to an institution with over $180 Million and four branches today. Canseco served as Board President since 1995.\n\n\nCanseco ran for the newly redrawn Texas' 28th congressional district. In the Republican primary, he and attorney Jim Hopson qualified for a run-off election. Canseco got just 21% of the vote, while Hopson got 49% of the vote (barely missing the 50% threshold to win the primary). In the run-off election, Hopson defeated Canseco 65%–35%.\n\n\nCanseco was defeated in the Republican primary by Bexar County Commissioner and former San Antonio city councilman Lyle Larson 62%–38%.\n\n\nIn the Republican primary, Canseco and CIA officer Will Hurd qualified for a run-off election; Hurd got 34%, while Canseco got 32%. In the run-off, Canseco defeated Hurd 53%–47%.\n\nIn the general election, Canseco faced incumbent Democratic congressman Ciro Rodriguez. The Republican National Committee gave strong financial support to Canseco in an effort to regain the seat for the Republicans. As of October 13, 2010, Rodriguez had raised more cash overall ($1,481,520 versus Canseco's $980,821), but Canseco had more cash on hand ($147,961 versus Rodriguez's $90,915).\n\nCanseco defeated Rodriguez 49%–44%.\n\n\nCiro Rodriguez filed for a rematch with Canseco in 2012, but he lost the Democratic primary to State Representative Pete Gallego, 55%–45%.\n\nIn the November 6 general election, Gallego defeated Canseco 50%–46%. Two minor candidates held the remaining 4.1% of the ballots. The race was contested amid allegations of voter fraud and irregularities. On November 9, Canseco conceded to Gallego, citing the high costs and lengthy period of time required to contest the election. Although Canseco continued to allege numerous irregularities, he had concluded that \"a full investigation and recount would be expensive and time-consuming,\" considering that the 23rd District embraces all or parts of 29 counties. Canseco carried the district's portion of Bexar County, home to more than half the district's population. However, it was not enough to overcome Gallego's margins in the central and western portions of the district, which were virtually coextensive with Gallego's old state House district. Gallego also dominated the heavily Hispanic border areas.\n\n\nIn a bid to return to Congress, Canseco polled 10,204 votes (40.4%) in the Republican primary on March 4. He finished a close second to Will Hurd, his intraparty rival from 2010. Hurd, an African American, received 10,348 votes (49.9%). The remaining 4,723 votes (18.7%) went to a third candidate, Robert Lowry. In the May 27 runoff Hurd handily defeated Canseco, 8,698 (59.5%) to 5,924 (40.5%). Hurd faced freshman Democratic Representative Pete Gallego in the November 4 general election, and ultimately won.\n\nWhen Canseco ran for Congress in 2010, he obtained two loans totaling $88,000 from his family-owned enterprises. The money was taken from a bank account of a subsidiary company with an address in Mexico. He also provided $86,000 in his own funds as a campaign loan. As Canseco runs in 2014, federal regulators are auditing his campaign funds to see if they are in violation of restrictions on corporate contributions and a longstanding ban on political donations made by foreign nationals, corporations, partnerships, and associations.\n\n\nIn another bid to return to Congress, Canseco ran in the 18-way Republican primary for Texas's 21st congressional district to succeed the retiring incumbent Republican Lamar Smith. He was ultimately unsuccessful, garnering less than 5% of the vote.\n\nCanseco describes himself as a \"limited-government conservative.\"\n\nHe supports the Arizona immigration law. He supports the extension of the Bush tax cuts and repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. During the campaign, Canseco openly identified with the Tea Party movement.\n\nCanseco was a member of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans. During his tenure, he was one of four voting Latino members of Congress known to be a member of the RSC, the others being Bill Flores of Texas, Raul Labrador of Idaho and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington. He was also a member of the Congressional Hispanic Conference. In 2012, Canseco delivered the Spanish language version of the Republican response to the State of the Union address.\n\nIn summer 2011, Canseco was criticized after initially declining to introduce a bill allowing for a swap of land between the Federal Government and Bexar County, Texas. The bill, which was supported by United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and sponsored by retiring Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Senate, would expand the development of the San Antonio River to the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.\n\nIn October 2011, Canseco introduced the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park Boundary Expansion Act in the House, which mirrored Hutchison's Senate bill. The legislation would cost roughly $4 million over four years, even though the lands would be donated.\n\nIn April 2012, Canseco traveled using the San Antonio International Airport. He said that he was assaulted by the Transportation Security Administration when an officer \"was patting me down where no one is supposed to go.\" The TSA officer said that he was assaulted by Canseco, but no arrests were made. Canseco advocates for changes in security procedures.\n\nCanseco reportedly voted with his party 96% of the time on all issues.\n\n\nCanseco and his wife, Gloria, have been married since 1979. The couple resides in San Antonio. They have three children and attend St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Church. He attended Culver Military Academy in his youth.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2652453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2652453", "title": "Sama-Bajau", "text": "Sama-Bajau\n\nThe Sama-Bajau refers to several Austronesian ethnic groups of Maritime Southeast Asia with their origins from the southern Philippines. The name collectively refers to related people who usually call themselves the Sama or Samah; or are known by the exonyms Bajau (, also spelled Badjao, Bajaw, Badjau, Badjaw, Bajo or Bayao) and Samal or Siyamal (the latter being considered offensive). They usually live a seaborne lifestyle, and use small wooden sailing vessels such as the \"perahu\" (\"layag\" in Meranau), \"djenging\", \"balutu\", \"lepa\", \"pilang\", and \"vinta\" (or \"lepa-lepa\"). Some Sama-Bajau groups native to Sabah are also known for their traditional horse culture.\n\nThe Sama-Bajau are traditionally from the many islands of the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines, coastal areas of Mindanao, northern and eastern Borneo, the Celebes, and throughout eastern Indonesian islands. In the Philippines, they are grouped together with the religiously-similar Moro people. Within the last fifty years, many of the Filipino Sama-Bajau have migrated to neighbouring Malaysia and the northern islands of the Philippines, due to the conflict in Mindanao. As of 2010, they were the second-largest ethnic group in the Malaysian state of Sabah.\n\nSama-Bajau have sometimes been called the \"Sea Gypsies\" or \"Sea Nomads\", terms that have also been used for non-related ethnic groups with similar traditional lifestyles, such as the Moken of the Burmese-Thai Mergui Archipelago and the Orang Laut of southeastern Sumatra and the Riau Islands of Indonesia. The modern outward spread of the Sama-Bajau from older inhabited areas seems to have been associated with the development of sea trade in sea cucumber (trepang).\n\nLike the term Kadazan-Dusun, Sama-Bajau is a collective term, used to describe several closely related indigenous people who consider themselves a single distinct \"bangsa\" (\"ethnic group\" or \"nation\"). It is generally accepted that these groups of people can be termed Sama or Bajau, though they never call themselves \"Bajau\" in the Philippines. Instead, they call themselves with the names of their tribes, usually the place they live or place of origin. For example, the sea-going Sama-Bajau prefer to call themselves the Sama Dilaut or Sama Mandilaut (literally \"sea Sama\" or \"ocean Sama\") in the Philippines; while in Malaysia, they identify as Bajau Laut.\n\nHistorically in the Philippines, the term \"Sama\" was used to describe the more land-oriented and settled Sama–Bajau groups, while \"Bajau\" was used to describe the more sea-oriented, boat-dwelling, nomadic groups. Even these distinctions are fading as the majority of Sama-Bajau have long since abandoned boat living, most for Sama–style piling houses in the coastal shallows.\n\n\"Sama\" is believed to have originated from the Austronesian root word \"sama\" meaning \"together\", \"same\", or \"kin\". The exact origin of the exonym \"Bajau\" is unclear. Some authors have proposed that it is derived from a corruption of the Malay word \"berjauh\" (\"getting further apart\" or \"the state of being away\"). Other possible origins include the Brunei Malay word \"bajaul\", which means \"to fish\". The term \"Bajau\" has pejorative connotations in the Philippines, indicating poverty in comparison to the term \"Sama\". Especially since it is used most commonly to refer to poverty-stricken Sama-Bajau who make a living through begging.\n\nBritish administrators in Sabah classified the Sama-Bajau as \"Bajau\" and labelled them as such in their birth certificates. Thus the Sama-Bajau in Malaysia may sometimes self-identify as \"Bajau\" or even \"Malay\" (though the preferred term is \"Sama\"), for political reasons. This is due to the government recognition of the Sama-Bajau as legally Bumiputera (indigenous native) under the name \"Bajau\". This ensures easy access to the special privileges granted to ethnic Malays. This is especially true for recent Moro Filipino migrants. The indigenous Sama-Bajau in Malaysia have also started labelling themselves as their ancestors called themselves, such as Simunul.\n\nFor most of their history, the Sama-Bajau have been a nomadic, seafaring people, living off the sea by trading and subsistence fishing. The boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau see themselves as non-aggressive people. They kept close to the shore by erecting houses on stilts, and travelled using \"lepa\", handmade boats which many lived in.\n\nMost of the various oral traditions and \"tarsila\" (royal genealogies) among the Sama-Bajau have a common theme which claims that they were originally a land-dwelling people who were the subjects of a king who had a daughter. After she is lost by either being swept away to the sea (by a storm or a flood) or being taken captive by a neighbouring kingdom, they were then supposedly ordered to find her. After failing to do so they decided to remain nomadic for fear of facing the wrath of the king.\n\nOne such version widely told among the Sama-Bajau of Borneo claims that they descended from Johorean royal guards who were escorting a princess named Dayang Ayesha for marriage to a ruler in Sulu. However, the Sultan of Brunei (allegedly Muhammad Shah of Brunei) also fell in love with the princess. On the way to Sulu, they were attacked by Bruneians in the high seas. The princess was taken captive and married to the Sultan of Brunei instead. The escorts, having lost the princess, elected to settle in Borneo and Sulu rather than return to Johor.\n\nAmong the Indonesian Sama-Bajau, on the other hand, their oral histories place more importance on the relationship of the Sama-Bajau with the Sultanate of Gowa rather than Johor. The various versions of their origin myth tell about a royal princess who was washed away by a flood. She was found and eventually married a king or a prince of Gowa. Their offspring then allegedly became the ancestors of the Indonesian Sama-Bajau.\n\nHowever, there are other versions which are also more mythological and do not mention a princess. Among the Philippine Sama-Bajau, for example, there is a myth that claims that the Sama-Bajau were accidentally towed into what is now Zamboanga by a giant stingray. Incidentally, the native pre-Hispanic name of Zamboanga City is \"Samboangan\" (literally \"mooring place\"), which was derived from the Sinama word for a mooring pole, \"sambuang\" or \"samboang\".\n\nThe origin myths claiming descent from Johor or Gowa have been largely rejected by modern scholars, mostly because these kingdoms were established too recently to explain the ethnic divergence. Though whether the Sama-Bajau are indigenous to their current territories or settled from elsewhere is still contentious. Linguistically, they are distinct from neighbouring populations, especially from the Tausūg who are more closely related to the northern Philippine ethnic groups like the Visayans.\n\nIn 1965, the anthropologist David E. Sopher claimed that the Sama-Bajau, along with the Orang Laut, descended from ancient \"Veddoid\" (Australoid) hunter-gatherers from the Riau Archipelago who intermarried with Austronesians. They retained their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, though they became more maritime-oriented as Southeast Asia became more populated by later Austronesian settlers like the Malays.\nIn 1968, the anthropologist Harry Arlo Nimmo, on the other hand, believed that the Sama-Bajau are indigenous to the Sulu Archipelago, Sulawesi, and/or Borneo, and do not share a common origin with the Orang Laut. Nimmo proposed that the boat-dwelling lifestyle developed among the ancestors of the Sama-Bajau independently from the Orang Laut.\n\nA more recent study in 1985 by the anthropologist Alfred Kemp Pallasen compares the oral traditions with historical facts and linguistic evidence. He puts the date of the ethnogenesis of Sama-Bajau as 800 AD and also rejects a historical connection between the Sama-Bajau and the Orang Laut. He hypothesises that the Sama-Bajau originated from a proto-Sama-Bajau people inhabiting the Zamboanga Peninsula who practised both fishing and slash-and-burn agriculture. They were the original inhabitants of Zamboanga and the Sulu archipelago, and were well-established in the region long before the first arrival of the Tausūg people at around the 13th century from their homelands along the northern coast of eastern Mindanao. Along with the Tausūg, they were heavily influenced by the Malay kingdoms both culturally and linguistically, becoming Indianised by the 15th century and Islamised by the 16th century. They also engaged in extensive trade with China for \"luxury\" sea products like trepang, pearls, and shark fin.\n\nFrom Zamboanga, some members of this people adopted an exclusively seaborne culture and spread outwards in the 10th century towards Basilan, Sulu, Borneo, and Sulawesi. They arrived in Borneo in the 11th century. This hypothesis is currently the most widely accepted among specialists studying the Austronesian peoples. This would also explain why even boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau still practice agricultural rituals, despite being exclusively fishermen. Linguistic evidence further points to Borneo as the ultimate origin of the proto-Sama-Bajau people.\n\nA genetic study of three groups - the Derawan of Northeast Borneo, the Kotabaru of Southeast Borneo and the Kendari of Southeast Sulawesi - suggested that their origin was in southern Sulawesi. Each group had its own unique genetic contribution from neighboring populations. These genetic findings are consistent with the oral history.\n\nThe epic poem \"Darangan\" of the Maranao people record that among the ancestors of the hero Bantugan is a Maranao prince who married a Sama-Bajau princess. Estimated to have happened in 840 AD, it is the oldest account of the Sama-Bajau. It further corroborates the fact that they predate the arrival of the Tausūg settlers and are indigenous to the Sulu archipelago and parts of Mindanao.\n\nSama-Bajau were first recorded by European explorers in 1521 by Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan-Elcano expedition in what is now the Zamboanga Peninsula. Pigafetta writes that the \"people of that island make their dwellings in boats and do not live otherwise\". They have also been present in the written records of other Europeans henceforth; including in Sulawesi by the Dutch colonies in 1675, in Sulawesi and eastern Borneo by Thomas Forrest in the 1770s, and in the west coast of Borneo by Spenser St. John in the 1850s and 1860s.\nSama-Bajau were often widely mentioned in connection to sea raids (\"mangahat\"), piracy and the slave trade in Southeast Asia during the European colonial period, indicating that at least some Sama-Bajau groups from northern Sulu (e.g. the Banguingui) were involved, along with non-Sama-Bajau groups like the Iranun. The scope of their pirate activities was extensive, commonly sailing from Sulu to as far as Moluccas and back again. Aside from early European colonial records, they may have also been the pirates described by Chinese and Arab sources in the Straits of Singapore in the 12th and 13th centuries. Sama-Bajau usually served as low-ranking crewmembers of warboats, directly under the command of Iranun squadron leaders, who in turn answered to the Tausūg \"datu\" of the Sultanate of Sulu.\n\nThe Bajoe harbour in Sulawesi was the site of a small settlement of Sama-Bajau under the Bugis Sultanate of Bone. They were significantly involved in First and Second Bone Wars (1824–1825), when the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army sent a punitive expedition in retaliation for Bugis and Makassar attacks on local Dutch garrisons. After the fall of Bone, most Sama-Bajau resettled in other areas of Sulawesi.\n\nDuring the British colonial rule of Sabah, the Sama-Bajau were involved in two uprisings against the North Borneo Chartered Company: the Mat Salleh Rebellion from 1894 to 1905, and the Pandasan Affair of 1915.\n\nModern Sama-Bajau are generally regarded as peaceful, hospitable, and cheerful people, despite their humble circumstances. However, a significant number are also illiterate, uneducated, and impoverished, due to their nomadic lifestyle.\n\nThe number of modern Sama-Bajau who are born and live primarily at sea is diminishing. Cultural assimilation and modernisation are regarded as the main causes. Particularly after the dissolution of the Sultanate of Sulu, who were the traditional patrons of the Sama-Bajau for bartering fish for farm goods. The money-based fish markets which replaced the seasonal trade around mooring points necessitates a more land-based lifestyle for greater market penetration. In Malaysia, some hotly debated government programs have also resettled Bajau to the mainland.\n\nThe Sama-Bajau in the Sulu Archipelago were historically discriminated against by the dominant Tausūg people, who viewed boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau as 'inferior' and as outsiders (the traditional Tausūg term for them is the highly offensive \"Luwaan\", meaning \"spat out\" or \"outcast\"). They were also marginalised by other Moro peoples because they still practised animist folk religions either exclusively or alongside Islam, and thus were viewed as \"uncivilised pagans\". Boat-dwelling and shoreline Sama-Bajau had a very low status in the caste-based Tausūg Sultanate of Sulu. This survived into the modern Philippines where the Sama-Bajau are still subjected to strong cultural prejudice from the Tausūg. The Sama-Bajau have also been frequent victims of theft, extortion, kidnapping, and violence from the predominantly Tausūg Abu Sayyaf insurgents as well as pirates.\n\nThis discrimination and the continuing violence in Muslim Mindanao have driven many Sama-Bajau to emigrate. They usually resettle in Malaysia and Indonesia, where they have more employment opportunities. But even in Malaysia their presence is still controversial as most of them are illegal immigrants. Most illegal Sama-Bajau immigrants enter Malaysia through offshore islands. From there, they enter mainland Sabah to find work as manual labourers. Others migrate to the northern islands of the Philippines, particularly to the Visayas, Palawan, the northern coast of Mindanao, and even as far as southern Luzon. Though these are relatively safer regions, they are also more economically disadvantaged and socially excluded, leading to Filipinos sometimes stereotyping the boat-dwelling Sama-Bajau as beggars and squatters.\nThe ancestral roaming and fishing grounds of the Sama-Bajau straddled the borders of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. And they have sometimes voyaged as far as the Timor and Arafura Seas. In modern times, they have lost access to most of these sites. There have been efforts to grant Sama-Bajau some measures of rights to fish in traditional areas, but most Sama-Bajau still suffer from legal persecution. For example, under a 1974 Memorandum of Understanding, \"Indonesian traditional fishermen\" are allowed to fish within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Australia, which includes traditional fishing grounds of Sama-Bajau fishermen. However, illegal fishing encroachment of Corporate Sea Trawlers in these areas has led to concern about overfishing, and the destruction of Sama-Bajau vessels. In 2014, Indonesian authorities destroyed six Filipino Sama-Bajau boats caught fishing in Indonesian waters. This is particularly serious for the Sama-Bajau, whose boats are also oftentimes their homes.\n\nSama-Bajau fishermen are often associated with illegal and destructive practices, like blast fishing, cyanide fishing, coral mining, and cutting down mangrove trees. It is believed that the Sama-Bajau resort to these activities mainly due to sedentarisation brought about by the restrictions imposed on their nomadic culture by modern nation states. With their now limited territories, they have little alternative means of competing with better-equipped land-based and commercial fishermen, and earn enough to feed their families. The Indonesian government and certain non-governmental organisations, have launched several programs for providing alternative sustainable livelihood projects for Sama-Bajau to discourage these practices (such as the use of fish aggregating devices instead of explosives). Medical health centres (\"puskesmas\") and schools have also been built even for stilt-house Sama-Bajau communities. Similar programs have also been implemented in the Philippines.\n\nWith the loss of their traditional fishing grounds, some refugee groups of Sama-Bajau in the Philippines are forced to resort to begging (\"agpangamu\" in Sinama), particularly diving for coins thrown by inter-island ferry passengers (\"angedjo\"). Other traditional sources of income include selling grated cassava (\"magliis\"), mat-weaving (\"ag-tepoh\"), and jewellery-making (especially from pearls). Recently, there have been more efforts by local governments in the Philippines to rehabilitate Sama-Bajau refugees and teach them livelihood skills. In 2016, the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources started a project for distributing fishing boats, gear, and other livelihood materials among Sama-Bajau communities in Luzon. This was largely the result of raised awareness and an outpouring of support after a photo of a Sama-Bajau beggar, Rita Gaviola (dubbed the \"Badjao Girl\"), went viral in the Philippines.\n\nThe Sama-Bajau are fragmented into highly diverse subgroups. They have never been politically united and are usually subject to the land-based political groups of the areas they settle, such as the Sultanate of Brunei and the former Sultanate of Sulu.\n\nMost subgroups of Sama-Bajau name themselves after the place they originated from (usually an island). Each subgroup speaks a distinct language or dialect that are usually mutually intelligible with their immediate neighbouring subgroup in a continuous linguistic chain. In the Philippines, the Sama-Bajau can be divided into three general groups based on where they settle:\n\nOther minor Sama-Bajau groups named after islands of origin include the Sama Bannaran, Sama Davao, Sama Zamboanga Sikubung, Sama Tuaran, Sama Semporna, Sama Sulawesi, Sama Simunul, Sama Tabawan, Sama Tandubas (or Sama Tando' Bas), and Sama Ungus Matata. Mixed-heritage Sama-Bajau and Tausūg communities are sometimes known as \"Bajau Suluk\" in Malaysia. People of multiple ethnic parentage may further identify with a three-part self-description, such as \"Bajau Suluk Dusun\". The following are the major subgroups usually recognised as distinct:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sama–Bajau peoples speak some ten languages of the Sama–Bajau subgroup of the Western Malayo-Polynesian language family. Sinama is the most common name for these languages, but they are also called Bajau, especially in Malaysia. Most Sama-Bajau can speak multiple languages.\n\nThe Sama-Bajau languages were once classified under the Central Philippine languages of the Malayo-Polynesian geographic group of the Austronesian language family. But due to marked differences with neighbouring languages, they were moved to a separate branch altogether from all other Philippine languages. For example, Sinama pronunciation is quite distinct from other nearby Central Philippine languages like Tausūg and Tagalog. Instead of the primary stress being usually on the final syllable; the primary stress occurs on the second-to-the-last syllable of the word in Sinama. This placement of the primary stress is similar to Manobo and other languages of the predominantly animistic ethnic groups of Mindanao, the Lumad peoples.\n\nIn 2006, the linguist Robert Blust, proposed that the Sama-Bajaw languages derived from the Barito lexical region, though not from any established group. It is thus a sister group to other Barito languages like Dayak and Malagasy. It is classified under the Bornean geographic group.\n\nSama-Bajau languages are usually written in the Jawi alphabet.\n\nReligion can vary among the Sama-Bajau subgroups; from a strict adherence to Sunni Islam, forms of folk Islam (itself influenced by Sufi traditions of early Muslim missionaries), to animistic beliefs in spirits and ancestor worship. There is a small minority of Catholics and Protestants, particularly from Davao del Sur in the Philippines.\n\nAmong the modern coastal Sama-Bajau of Malaysia, claims to religious piety and learning are an important source of individual prestige. Some of the Sama-Bajau lack mosques and must rely on the shore-based communities such as those of the more Islamised or Malay peoples. Some of the more nomadic Sama-Bajau, like the Ubian Bajau, are much less adherent to orthodox Islam. They practice a syncretic form of folk Islam, revering local sea spirits, known in Islamic terminology as Jinn.\nThe ancient Sama-Bajau were animistic, and this is retained wholly or partially in some Sama-Bajau groups. The supreme deities in Sama-Bajau mythology are \"Umboh Tuhan\" (also known as \"Umboh Dilaut\", the \"Lord of the Sea\") and his consort, \"Dayang Dayang Mangilai\" (\"Lady of the Forest\"). \"Umboh Tuhan\" is regarded as the creator deity who made humans equal with animals and plants. Like other animistic religions, they fundamentally divide the world into the physical and spiritual realms which coexist. In modern Muslim Sama-Bajau, \"Umboh Tuhan\" (or simply \"Tuhan\" or \"Tuan\") is usually equated with Allah.\n\nOther objects of reverence are spirits known as \"umboh\" (\"ancestor\", also variously spelled \"omboh\", \"m'boh\", \"mbo\"', etc.). Traditionally, the \"umboh\" referred more specifically to ancestral spirits, different from the \"saitan\" (nature spirits) and the \"jinn\" (familiar spirits); some literature refers to all of them as \"umboh\". These include \"Umboh Baliyu\" (the spirits of wind and storms), and \"Umboh Payi\" or \"Umboh Gandum\" (the spirits of the first rice harvest). They include totemic spirits of animals and plants, including \"Umboh Summut\" (totem of ants) and \"Umboh Kamun\" (totem of mantis shrimp).\n\nThe construction and launch of sailing vessels are ritualised, and the vessels are believed to have a spirit known as \"Sumangâ\" (\"guardian\", literally \"one who deflects attacks\"). The \"umboh\" are believed to influence fishing activities, rewarding the Sama-Bajau by granting good luck favours known as \"padalleang\" and occasionally punishing by causing serious incidents called \"busong\".\n\nTraditional Sama-Bajau communities may have shamans (\"dukun\") traditionally known as the \"kalamat\". The \"kalamat\" are known in Muslim Sama-Bajau as the \"wali jinn\" (literally \"custodian of jinn\") and may adhere to taboos concerning the treatment of the sea and other cultural aspects. The \"kalamat\" preside over Sama-Bajau community events along with mediums known as \"igal jinn\". The \"kalamat\" and the \"igal jinn\" are said to be \"spirit-bearers\" and are believed to be hosts of familiar spirits. It is not, however, regarded as a spirit possession, since the \"igal jinn\" never lose control of their bodies. Instead, the \"igal jinn\" are believed to have acquired their familiar spirit (\"jinn\") after surviving a serious or near-fatal illness. For the rest of their lives, the \"igal jinn\" are believed to share their bodies with the particular \"jinn\" who saved them.\n\nOne important religious event among the Sama-Bajau is the annual feast known as \"pag-umboh\" or \"magpaay-bahaw\", an offering of thanks to \"Umboh Tuhan\". In this ceremony, newly harvested rice (\"paay-bahaw\") are dehusked (\"magtaparahu\") while Islamic prayers (\"duaa\") are recited. They are dried (\"magpatanak\") and are then laid out in small conical piles symbolic of mountains (\"bud\") on the living room floor (a process known as the \"sleeping of rice\"). After two or three nights, two-thirds are set aside for making sweet rice meals (\"panyalam\"), while one-third is set aside for making sweet rice cakes (\"durul\"). Additional prayers (\"zikir\"), which includes calling the names of ancestors out loud, are offered to the \"Umboh\" after the rice meals have been prepared. \"Pag-umboh\" is a solemn and formal affair.\n\nAnother annual religious ceremony among the boat-dwelling Sama Dilaut is the \"pagkanduli\" (literally \"festive gathering\"). It involves ritual dancing to \"Umboh Tuhan\", \"Dayang Dayang Mangilai\", and ancestral ghosts called \"bansa\". The ritual is first celebrated under a sacred \"dangkan\" tree (strangler figs, known elsewhere in the Philippines as \"balete\") symbolising the male spirit \"Umboh Tuhan\" and afterwards in the centre of a grove of \"kama'toolang\" trees (pandan trees) symbolising the female spirit \"Dayang Dayang Mangilai\".\n\nThe trance dancing is called \"mag-igal\" and involves female and male and \"igal jinn\", called the \"jinn denda\" and \"jinn lella\" respectively. The \"jinn denda\" perform the first dance known as \"igal limbayan\" under the \"dangkan\" tree, with the eldest leading. They are performed with intricate movements of the hands, usually with metal fingernail extensions called \"sulingkengkeng\". If the dance and music are pleasing, the \"bansa\" are believed to take possession of the dancers, whereupon the \"wali jinn\" will assist in releasing them at the end of the dance.\n\nThe \"bansa\" are not feared as they are regarded as spirits of ancestors. Temporarily serving as hosts for the \"bansa\" while dancing to music is regarded as a \"gift\" by the living Sama Dilaut to their ancestors. After the \"igal limbayan\", the \"wali jinn\" will invite the audience to participate, to celebrate, and to give their thanks. The last dance is the \"igal lellang\", with four \"jinn lella\" performing a warrior dance, whereupon the participants will proceed to the \"kama'toolang\" grove. There they will perform rituals and dance (this time with male and female dancers together), symbolically \"inviting\" \"Dayang Dayang Mangilai\" to come with them back to the \"dangkan\" tree. Further games and celebrations are held under the original \"dangkan\" tree before the celebrants say their farewells to the spirits. Unlike \"pag-umboh\", \"pagkanduli\" is a joyous celebration, involving singing, dancing, and joking among all participants. It is the largest festive event among the Sama Dilaut communities.\n\nAside from \"pagkanduli\" and \"magpaay-bahaw\", public dances called \"magigal jinn\" may occur. During these celebrations, the \"igal jinn\" may be consulted for a public séance and for nightly trance dancing. In times of epidemics, the \"igal jinn\" are called upon to remove illness causing spirits from the community. They do this by setting a \"spirit boat\" adrift in the open sea beyond the village or anchorage.\n\nA few Sama-Bajau still live traditionally. They live in houseboats (\"lepa\") which generally accommodate a single nuclear family (usually five people). The houseboats travel together in flotillas with houseboats of immediate relatives (a family alliance) and co-operate during fishing expeditions and in ceremonies. A married couple may choose to sail with the relatives of the husband or the wife. They anchor at common mooring points (called \"sambuangan\") with other flotillas (usually also belonging to extended relatives) at certain times of the year.\n\nThese mooring points are usually presided over by an elder or headsman. The mooring points are close to sources of water or culturally significant locations like island cemeteries. There are periodic gatherings of Sama-Bajau clans usually for various ceremonies like weddings or festivals. They generally do not sail more than from their \"home\" moorage. They periodically trade goods with the land-based communities of other Sama-Bajau and other ethnic groups. Sama-Bajau groups may routinely cross the borders of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia for fishing, trading, or visiting relatives.\n\nSama-Bajau women also use a traditional sun-protecting powder called \"burak\" or \"borak\", made from water weeds, rice and spices.\n\nSama-Bajau are noted for their exceptional abilities in free-diving. Divers work long days with the \"greatest daily apnea diving time reported in humans\" of greater than 5 hours per day submerged. Some Bajau intentionally rupture their eardrums at an early age to facilitate diving and hunting at sea. Many older Sama-Bajau are therefore hard of hearing.\n\nMore than a thousand years of subsistence freediving associated with their life on the sea appear to have endowed the Bajau with several genetic adaptations to facilitate their lifestyle. A 2018 study showed that Bajau spleens are about 50 per cent larger than those of a neighboring land-based group, the Saluan, letting them store more haemoglobin-rich blood, which is expelled into the bloodstream when the spleen contracts at depth, allowing breath-holding dives of longer duration. This difference is apparently related to a variant of the PDE10A gene. Other genes that appear to have been under selection in the Bajau include BDKRB2, which is related to peripheral vasoconstriction, involved in the diving response; FAM178B, a regulator of carbonic anhydrase, which is related to maintaining blood pH when carbon dioxide accumulates; and another one involved in the response to hypoxia. These adaptions most likely result from an increased frequency of alleles widely distributed in human populations. Members of another \"sea gypsy\" group, the Moken, have been found to have better underwater vision than Europeans, although it is not known if this trait has a genetic basis.\n\nSama-Bajau traditional songs are handed down orally through generations. The songs are usually sung during marriage celebrations (\"kanduli pagkawin\"), accompanied by dance (\"pang-igal\") and musical instruments like \"pulau\" (flute), \"gabbang\" (xylophone), \"tagunggo'\" (kulintang gongs), \"biula\" (violin), and in modern times, electronic keyboards. There are several types of Sama-Bajau traditional songs, they include: \"isun-isun\", \"runsai\", \"najat\", \"syair\", \"nasid\", \"bua-bua anak\", and \"tinggayun\".\n\nAmong the more specific examples of Sama-Bajau songs are three love songs collectively referred to as \"Sangbayan\". These are \"Dalling Dalling\", \"Duldang Duldang\", and \"Pakiring Pakiring\". The most well-known of these three is \"Pakiring Pakiring\" (literally \"moving the hips\"), which is more familiar to the Tausūg in its commercialised and modernised form \"Dayang Dayang\". The Tausūg claim that the song is native to their culture, and whether the song is originally Tausūg or Sama-Bajau remain controversial. Most Sama-Bajau folk songs are becoming extinct, largely due to the waning interest of the younger generations.\n\nSama-Bajau people are also well known for weaving and needlework skills.\n\nThe more settled land-based West Coast Bajau are expert equestrians – which makes them remarkable in Malaysia, where horse riding has never been widespread anywhere else. The traditional costume of Sama-Bajau horsemen consists of a black or white long-sleeved shirt (\"badu sampit\") with gold buttons (\"betawi\") on the front and decorated with silver floral designs (\"intiras\"), black or white trousers (\"seluar sampit\") with gold lace trimmings, and a headpiece (\"podong\"). They carry a spear (\"bujak\"), a riding crop (\"pasut\"), and a silver-hilted \"keris\" dagger. The horse is also caparisoned with a colourful outfit called \"kain kuda\" that also have brass bells (\"seriau\") attached. The saddle (\"sila sila\") is made from water buffalo hide, and padded with cloth (\"lapik\") underneath.\n\nThough some Sama-Bajau headsmen have been given honorific titles like \"datu\", \"maharaja\" or \"panglima\" by governments (like under the Sultanate of Brunei), they usually only had little authority over the Sama-Bajau community. Sama-Bajau society is traditionally highly individualistic, and the largest political unit is the clan cluster around mooring points, rarely more. Unlike most neighbouring peoples, Sama-Bajau society is also more or less egalitarian, and they did not practice a caste system. The individualism is probably due to the generally fragile nature of their relationships with land-based peoples for access to essentials like wood or water. When the relationship sours or if there is too much pressure from land-based rulers, the Sama-Bajau prefer to simply move on elsewhere. Greater importance is placed on kinship and reciprocal labour rather than formal authority for maintaining social cohesion. There are a few exceptions, however, like the Jama Mapun and the Sama Pangutaran of the Philippines, who follow the traditional pre-Hispanic Philippine feudal society with a caste system consisting of nobles, notables, and commoners and serfs. Likely introduced by the Sultanate of Sulu.\n\nIt has been suggested by some researchers that Sama-Bajau people's visits to Arnhem Land gave rise to the accounts of the mysterious Baijini people in the myths of Australia's Yolngu Aboriginals.\n\nThe Sama-Bajau have also been the subject of several films. They include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor, and Catherine Van Brugh, the only child of Albany mayor Pieter Van Brugh (1666–1740). His older siblings included Robert Livingston (1708–1790), 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor, Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1710–1792), New York State Treasurer, and Philip Livingston (1716–1778), a member of the New York State Senate.\n\nLivingston received his early education from local schools and tutors. At age 13, Livingston was sent to live for a year and prepare for college with the Anglican missionary catechist and Yale College graduate Henry Barclay who lived among the Iroquois Indians in the Mohawk Valley at Fort Hunter. Livingston enrolled at Yale in 1737 and graduated in 1741. He went on to New York City, where he studied law and became a law clerk first for the eminent lawyer James Alexander. He left Alexander's office in the spring of 1746 before finishing his apprentiship due to some disagreement, and joined the office William Smith, Sr.\n\nHe became a lawyer in 1748 and began his practice in New York City. In 1752, he founded a weekly journal, the \"Independent Reflector\", along with fellow Presbyterian lawyers William Smith, Jr., the son of his law teacher, and John Morin Scott. The three were called by contemporaries \"The Triumvirate\". The \"Reflector\" was New York's first serial non-newspaper publication and the only one being published in British North America at the time. It was used as a platform by the political upstate Presbyterian landed \"country faction\" led by Livingston for challenging the powerful downstate Anglican and Dutch Reformed merchant or \"popular faction\" led by chief justice James De Lancey. Most notably the Triumvirate attacked the founding of King's College as a conspiracy by Anglicans to install a bishop in America, including his former tutor now Rev. Henry Barclay Rector of Trinity Church and his former law teacher James Alexander.\n\nPublication of the \"Reflector\" ceased with the fifty-second issue in late 1753 after political pressure was brought to bear upon its printer, James Parker, but Livingston and his allies continued to attack the college over the next year with columns in newspapers. By raising divisive issues of region, he managed to divert half the funds raised by a state lottery for the college to fund the construction of a new jail and a detention house for sailors from diseased ships. King's College was defiantly opened despite Livingston's efforts by President Rev. Samuel Johnson in July 1754, and granted a charter by the King on October 31, 1754.\n\nThough he failed to close the college, and no bishop arrived as predicted, Livingston remained politically active and served one term in the New York Assembly until his political allies lost power in 1769.\n\nIn 1772, he moved to Elizabethtown (today Elizabeth, New Jersey), where he rented a house in town. A young Alexander Hamilton lived here with Livingston for at least the winter while he attended Francis Barber's grammar school. Livingston started construction of a large country home to house his growing family. The house, known as \"Liberty Hall\", still stands today. After attaining considerable influence amongst the local patriots, Livingston was elected to serve as one of New Jersey's delegates to the Continental Congress. He served from July 1774 to June 1776. In October 1775, he was commissioned a brigadier general of the New Jersey Militia.\n\nIn August 1776, he was elected Governor of New Jersey and was reelected to the office each year until his death in 1790. For much of the time between 1776 and 1779, the family was located in Parsippany for safety.\n\nLiberty Hall was frequently visited by British troops or naval forces since there was a substantial reward for Livingston's capture. One attempt to kidnap him took place in mid-June 1779. False information about Livingston visiting his second home in Parsippany resulted in a raid by Loyalists and their subsequent capture. The Loyalist mayor of New York City (and a distant cousin through the Schuyler family), David Mathews, was suspected by being behind the attempted capture of Livingston.\n\nThe family returned to Liberty Hall in 1779 to begin restoring their looted home. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.\n\nLivingston led the New Jersey Delegation to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was one of the signers of the Constitution. He was appointed United States Minister to the Netherlands in 1788 by U.S. Congress but turn down the proposition.\n\nLivingston married Susannah French (1723–1789) in New Jersey in 1745. She was the daughter of landowner, Philip French III and Susanna (née Brockholst) French. Her paternal grandparents were Phillip French, the 27th Mayor of New York City, and Annetje (née Philipse) French (the daughter of Frederick Philipse). Her maternal grandparents were Susanna Maria Brockholst and Anthony Brockholst, an acting Governor of Colonial New York under Sir Edmund Andros. They went on to have 13 children, including:\n\n\nLivingston died on July 25, 1790 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and was originally buried at Trinity Church, Manhattan, but on May 7, 1844 was reinterred at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn.\n\nLivingston's daughter, Sarah, was born in 1756 and was educated at home in penmanship, English grammar, the Bible, and classic literature. At a time when women were usually relegated to the kitchen, she was brought up to be politically aware, even serving at times as her father's secretary. who married John Jay at the age of 17 and became United States First Lady (age 22) while Jay served as the President of the Continental Congress from 1778–1779. Sarah accompanied John Jay to Spain and then Paris where he, along with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry Laurens negotiated the Treaty of Paris. She is credited with writing the celebratory Treaty of Paris dinner toast. When Sarah and John returned to New York, Jay was appointed U.S. Foreign Secretary, and her Parisian training came in handy, as she and her husband established the custom of weekly dinners for the diplomatic corps and other guests in the U.S. capital city of New York. Sarah would go on to serve in her hospitality role as the wife of the first Chief Justice of the United States and First Lady of New York.\n\nAnother descendant of William Livingston was Julia Kean, wife of United States Secretary of State and New York Governor Hamilton Fish.\n\nIn 1747, Livingston wrote and published a long pastoral poem entitled, \"Philosophic Solitude, or the Choice of a Rural Life\". One of the first successful original poems written by an American colonist, it was anthologized numerous times into the 19th century. In 1754, Livingston also played a key role in founding the New York Society Library, which is still in existence over a quarter of a millennium later.\n\nThe township of Livingston, New Jersey was given its name in his honor, as was Governor Livingston High School in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.\n\nThe Livingston campus of Rutgers University New Brunswick also was given its name in his honor.\n\n\n"}
